     "abstract": "The serotonin 1B receptor subtype is of interest in the pathophysiology and treatment of depression, anxiety, and migraine. Over recent years 5-HT1B receptor binding in human brain has been examined with PET using radioligands that are partial but not full agonists. To explore how the intrinsic activity of a PET radioligand may affect imaging performance, two high-affinity full 5-HT1B receptor agonists (AZ11136118, 4; and AZ11895987, 5) were selected from a large compound library and radiolabeled for PET examination in non-human primates.[11C]4 was obtained through Pd(0)-mediated insertion of [11C]carbon monoxide between prepared iodoarene and homochiral amine precursors. [11C]5 was obtained through N-11C-methylation of N-desmethyl precursor 6 with [11C]methyl triflate. [11C]4 and [11C]5 were studied with PET in rhesus or cynomolgus monkey. [11C]4 was studied with PET in mice and rats to measure brain uptake and specific binding. Ex-vivo experiments in rats were performed to identify whether there were radiometabolites in brain. Physiochemical parameters for [11C]4 (pKa, logD and conformational energetics) were evaluated.Both [11C]4 and [11C]5 were successfully produced in high radiochemical purity and in adequate amounts for PET experiments. After intravenous injection of [11C]4, brain radioactivity peaked at a low level (0.2 SUV). Pretreatment with tariquidar, an inhibitor of the brain P-gp efflux transporter, increased brain exposure four-fold whereas pretreatment with a high pharmacological dose of the 5-HT1B antagonist, AR-A000002, had no effect on the binding. Ex-vivo experiments in rats showed no radiometabolites entering brain. [11C]5 also failed to enter monkey brain under baseline conditions.[11C]4 and [11C]5 show too low brain uptake and specific binding to be useful PET radioligands. Low brain uptake is partly ascribed to efflux transporter action as well as unfavorable conformations.",

     "abstract": "While radiolabelled antibodies have found great utility as PET and SPECT imaging agents in oncological investigations, a notable shortcoming of these agents is their propensity to accumulate non-specifically within tumour tissue. The degree of this non-specific contribution to overall tumour uptake is highly variable and can ultimately lead to false conclusions. Therefore, in an effort to obtain a reliable measure of inter-individual differences in non-specific tumour uptake of radiolabelled antibodies, we demonstrate that the use of dual-isotope imaging overcomes this issue, enables true quantification of epitope expression levels, and allows non-invasive in vivo immunohistochemistry. The approach involves co-administration of (i) an antigen-targeting antibody labelled with zirconium-89 (89Zr), and (ii) an isotype-matched non-specific control IgG antibody labelled with indium-111 (111In). As an example, the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab was radiolabelled with 89Zr, and co-administered intravenously together with its 111In-labelled non-specific counterpart to mice bearing human breast cancer xenografts with differing HER2 expression levels (MDA-MB-468 [HER2-negative], MDA-MB-231 [low-HER2], MDA-MB-231/H2N [medium-HER2], and SKBR3 [high-HER2]). Simultaneous PET/SPECT imaging using a MILabs Vector4 small animal scanner revealed stark differences in the intratumoural distribution of [89Zr]Zr-trastuzumab and [111In]In-IgG, highlighting regions of HER2-mediated uptake and non-specific uptake, respectively. Normalisation of the tumour uptake values and tumour-to-blood ratios obtained with [89Zr]Zr-trastuzumab against those obtained with [111In]In-IgG yielded values which were most strongly correlated (R\u202f=\u202f0.94; P\u202f=\u202f0.02) with HER2 expression levels for each breast cancer type determined by Western blot and in vitro saturation binding assays, but not non-normalised uptake values. Normalised intratumoural distribution of [89Zr]Zr-trastuzumab correlated well with intratumoural heterogeneity HER2 expression.",

     "abstract": "The potential of the positron-emitting zirconium-89 (89Zr) (t1/2\u202f=\u202f78.4\u202fh) has been recently reported for immune positron emission tomography (immunoPET) radioimmunoconjugates design. In our work, we explored the optimized preparation of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab, and evaluated 89Zr-labeled monoclonal antibody (mAb) construct for targeted imaging of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpressed in glioma.To optimize the radiolabeling efficiency of 89Zr with DFO-nimotuzumab, multiple immunoconjugates and radiolabeling were performed. Radiolabeling yield, radiochemical purity, stability, and activity assay were investigated to characterize [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab for chemical and biological integrity. The in vivo behavior of this tracer was studied in mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG (EGFR-positive) tumors received a 3.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fMBq/dose using PET/CT imaging. One group mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG (EGFR-positive) tumors received [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab (3.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2\u202fMBq, ~3\u202f\u03bcg) (nonblocking) for immunoPET; the other group had 30\u202f\u03bcg predose (blocking) of cold nimotuzumab 24\u202fh prior to [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab.[89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab was prepared with high radiochemical yield (>90%), radiochemical purity (>99%), and specific activity (115\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.8\u202fMBq/mg).

A biodistribution study revealed excellent stability of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab in vivo compared with 89Zr as a bone seeker. High uptake in the liver and heart and modest penetration in the brain were observed, with no significant accumulation of activity in other organs. ImmunoPET studies also indicated prominent image contrast that remarkably high uptake up to ~20%ID/g for nonblocking and ~2%ID/g for blocking in tumor between 12 and 120\u202fh after administration.These studies developed a radiopharmaceutical [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab with optimized synthesis. The potential utility of [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab in assessing EGFR status in glioma was demonstrated in this study.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) often shows an overexpression of the gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPr). Therefore, GRPr is a possible theragnostic target. An interesting antagonist GRPr-ligand is RM2 or BAY86-7548. This study examines the accuracy of positron emission tomography (PET) with [68Ga]Ga-RM2 for diagnostic imaging of primary PCa (pPCa) compared to histopathology in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy (RP).[68Ga]Ga-RM2-PET examinations were performed in 15 patients before RP. All prostate specimens were histopathologically examined based on predefined spatial octants. Each prostate volume on PET was subdivided into octants, which were correlated to histopathology and evaluated according to presence of tumor by two experienced examiners. Additionally, PET data was evaluated by volume of interest (VOI) analyses in terms of maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and normalized SUVmax relative to background activity (rSUVmax). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for SUVmax and rSUVmax were calculated.At least one focus of increased [68Ga]Ga-RM2 uptake corresponding to a tumor manifestation on histology was found in 14 of 15 patients (93%). Spatial concordance of visual PET readings with histopathology was very variable. Intraindividual agreement reached from \u22642 octants in three, 3\u20135 octants in six to \u22656 octants in six patients, resulting in a relatively low correlation of visual PET readings with histopathology (accuracy\u202f=\u202f0.63; p\u202f=\u202f0.0018). Lesion-based analysis found a sensitivity of 69% and a positive predictive value of 73%. Concordantly, the octant-based ROC curves for SUVmax and rSUVmax indicated a relatively low diagnostic performance (area under the curve of 0.59 and 0.61, respectively).[68Ga]Ga-RM2-PET shows only a relatively low diagnostic accuracy for pPCa compared to histopathology on an octant basis, which may be explained to some extent by methodological weaknesses. Further studies need to explore, whether the observed high interindividual variability of agreement between [68Ga]Ga-RM2-PET and histopathology can be explained by different tumor biologies or other coincident prostatic pathologies.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxia, a common feature of most solid tumors, is an important predictor of tumor progression and resistance to radiotherapy. We developed a novel hypoxia imaging probe with optimal biological characteristics for use in clinical settings.We designed and synthesized several new hypoxia probes with additional hydrophilic characteristics compared to [18F]fluoromisonidazole ([18F]FMISO). These were 1-(2,2- Di hydroxy-methyl-3-[18F]- F luoropropyl) a zomycin ([18F]DiFA, formerly [18F]HIC101) and its analogs ([18F]F1 and [18F]F2). Biodistribution studies with EMT6 mammary carcinoma cell-bearing mice were performed 1 and 2\u202fh after injection of each probe. Small-animal positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies were conducted using [18F]DiFA and [18F]FMISO in the same mice. Tumoral hypoxia was confirmed via pimonidazole staining. Ex vivo digital autoradiographs were obtained for confirming the co-localization of [18F]DiFA and pimonidazole in the tumor tissues.The EMT6 tumors used had pimonidazole-positive regions. In biodistribution studies, the tumor-to-blood ratio and tumor-to-muscle ratio of [18F]DiFA was significantly higher than the respective [18F]FMISO ratios 1\u202fh after injection. Hence, we selected [18F]DiFA as the best hypoxia probe among those tested. Small-animal PET imaging studies showed time-dependent increases in the tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of [18F]DiFA uptake. Rapid clearance from the rest of the body was observed primarily via the renal system. Ex vivo autoradiography showed a positive correlation between [18F]DiFA uptake and the regions of pimonidazole distribution, indicating that [18F]DiFA selectively accumulated in the tumor tissue's hypoxic region.A better contrast image and a shorter waiting time may be obtained with [18F]DiFA than with [18F]FMISO.By optimizing LogP based on the [18F]FMISO structure, we demonstrated that [18F]DiFA could detect tumor hypoxia regions at an early time point.[18F]DiFA imaging facilitates the evaluation of various cancer hypoxic states due to the lower uptake of normal tissues and could contribute to novel treatment development.",

     "abstract": "Peripheral mu (\u03bc) opioid receptors are implicated in pain, bowel dysfunction and the progression of certain cancers. In an effort to identify radioligands well suited for imaging these peripheral sites, we have prepared and evaluated four hydrophilic [111In]-labeled, DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) conjugated \u03bc tetrapeptides.Peptides were prepared by solid-phase techniques, using orthogonal strategies to achieve branching to DOTA, and then characterized by HPLC, mass spectroscopy and amino acid analysis. Scaffolds included novel peptide H-Dmt-D-Ala-Phe-Orn-NH2 (DAPO), where Dmt\u202f=\u202f2\u2032,6\u2032-dimethyltyrosine, and known peptide H-Dmt-D-Arg-Phe-Lys-NH2 ([Dmt1]DALDA). Constructs had DOTA conjugation at the Orn4 or Lys4 side chains, or to the C-terminal through a hexanoic acid-lysine linker. Indium(III) complexation and [111In]-radiolabeling were accomplished by standard methods. Protein binding and Log D7.4 were determined. Binding and pharmacological profiles were obtained in vitro. Biodistribution and radiometabolite studies were conducted using male CD-1 mice.All four indium(III)-DOTA conjugates derived from DAPO and [Dmt1]DALDA showed good selectivity and subnanomolar affinity for \u03bc opioid receptors. One radioligand, H-Dmt-D-Ala-Phe-Orn(\u03b4-[111In]DOTA)-NH2, showed 25% specific binding in vivo to \u03bc sites in mouse gut. Notably, this was the least polar of the series, and also showed low sensitivity to modulation of binding by sodium ions. All radioligands showed high kidney uptake of radiometabolites.Visualizing peripheral \u03bc opioid receptors using [111In]-labeled, DOTA-conjugated tetrapeptides appears feasible, but structural modifications to enhance specific binding and metabolic stability, as well as to reduce kidney uptake, will be required.This study shows in vivo labeling of peripheral \u03bc opioid receptors by a tetrapeptide radioligand, and provides information that should prove useful in the design of peptide radioligands having optimal properties.",

This study shows the synthesis and characterization of KYCAR complexes containing nonradioactive rhenium, 99mTc, or 188Re. The metal complexes were also biologically evaluated to determine in vivo distribution in healthy mice. The overall goals of this project were (1) to synthesize the Tc/Re pentapeptide complexes, (2) to identify spectroscopic methods for characterization of syn versus anti rhenium peptide complexes, (3) to analyze the ex vivo stability, and (4) to assess the biological properties of the [99mTc]TcO-KYCAR and [188Re]ReO-KYCAR complexes in vivo. Details on these efforts are provided below.NatRe/99mTc/188ReO-KYCAR complexes were synthesized, and macroscopic species were characterized via HPLC, IR, NMR, and CD. These characterization data were compared to the crystallographic data of ReO-KYC to assist in the assignment of diastereomers and to aid in the determination of the structure of the complex.The radiometal complexes were synthesized with high purity (>95%). HPLC, IR, NMR and CD data on the macroscopic natReO-KYCAR complexes confirm the successful complexation as well as the presence of two diastereomers in syn and anticonformations. Tracer level complexes show favorable stabilities ex vivo for 2+\u202fh.Macroscopic metal complexes form diastereomers with the KYCAR ligand; however, this phenomenon is not readily observed on the tracer level due to the rapid interconversion. It was determined through pKa measurements that the macroscopic natReO-KYCAR complex is 0 at physiological pH. The [99mTc]TcO-KYCAR is stable in vitro while the [188Re]ReO-KYCAR shows 50% decomposition in PBS and serum. Biologically, the tracer level complexes clear through the hepatobiliary pathway.

     "abstract": "Primary aldosteronism accounts for 6\u201315% of hypertension cases, the single biggest contributor to global morbidity and mortality. Whilst ~50% of these patients have unilateral aldosterone-producing adenomas, only a minority of these have curative surgery as the current diagnosis of unilateral disease is poor. Carbon-11 radiolabelled metomidate ([11C]MTO) is a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer able to selectively identify CYP11B1/2 expressing adrenocortical lesions of the adrenal gland. However, the use of [11C]MTO is limited to PET centres equipped with on-site cyclotrons due to its short half-life of 20.4\u202fmin. Radiolabelling a fluorometomidate derivative with fluorine-18 (radioactive half life 109.8\u202fmin) in the para-aromatic position ([18F]FAMTO) has the potential to overcome this disadvantage and allow it to be transported to non-cyclotron-based imaging centres.Two strategies for the one-step radio-synthesis of [18F]FAMTO were developed. [18F]FAMTO was obtained via radiofluorination via use of sulfonium salt (1) and boronic ester (2) precursors. [18F]FAMTO was evaluated in vitro by autoradiography of pig adrenal tissues and in vivo by determining its biodistribution in rodents. Rat plasma and urine were analysed to determine [18F]FAMTO metabolites.[18F]FAMTO is obtained from sulfonium salt (1) and boronic ester (2) precursors in 7% and 32% non-isolated radiochemical yield (RCY), respectively. Formulated [18F]FAMTO was obtained with >99% radiochemical and enantiomeric purity with a synthesis time of 140\u202fmin from the trapping of [18F]fluoride ion on an anion-exchange resin (QMA cartridge). In vitro autoradiography of [18F]FAMTO demonstrated exquisite specific binding in CYP11B-rich pig adrenal glands. In vivo [18F]FAMTO rapidly accumulates in adrenal glands. Liver uptake was about 34% of that in the adrenals and all other organs were <12% of the adrenal uptake at 60\u202fmin post-injection.

The radiochemical yield of the [99mTc]Tc-ZHER2:V2-pemetrexed was identified by instant thin-layer chromatography (ITLC).

Chronic cholangiopathy and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) were induced by feeding mice 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl- 1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet or methionine and choline deficient (MCD) diet, respectively. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was evoked by intraperitoneal injection of 35\u202fmg/kg diethylnitrosamine (DEN) once a week for 23\u202fweeks. Gene expression of the murine bile acid transporters was determined by RT-qPCR.Hepatobiliary transport of 3\u03b2-[18F]FCA was not significantly altered after an APAP overdose. Mice fed the DDC or MCD diet showed impaired transport of 3\u03b2-[18F]FCA compared to baseline, which was associated with altered expression of the bile acid transporters ntcp, oatp4 and mrp2. After recovery from DDC- and MCD-induced liver injury, 3\u03b2-[18F]FCA parameters returned to baseline. Global hepatobiliary transport of 3\u03b2-[18F]FCA in HCC bearing mice was not significantly different compared to control mice. However, HCC lesions showed reduced hepatic uptake of the tracer (tumor-to-background: 0.45\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.13), which was in line with decreased in expression of basolateral bile acid uptake transporters nctp and oatp4 in tumor tissue.3\u03b2-[18F]FCA is a useful tool to assess and longitudinally follow-up liver function in several mouse models for liver diseases that are associated with altered expression of the bile acid transporters. These results point towards the (pre)clinical utility of 3\u03b2-[18F]FCA as a PET tracer to monitor altered liver functionality in patients with chronic liver diseases.",

Our group in past have evaluated a 99mTc-analogue of the above tracer, based on 99mTc-4\u202f+\u202f1 labeling approach, which exhibited significant affinity for NET but suffered from reduced specific uptake in comparison to reference standard no-carrier-added (n.c.a.) [125I]mIBG. The present work attempts to synthesize two new 99mTc-analogues of the radio-iodinated derivative following [99mTc]Tc(CO)31+ approach with an aim to improve the above specific uptake content.Two different precursors, xylylenediamine and 1,3-bis(chloromethyl)benzene, were synthetically modified to yield meta-functionalized benzylguanidine derivatives bearing iminodiacetate (IDA) and aminoethylglycine (AEG) tridentate chelating moieties, respectively. These ligands were labeled with technetium-99m via [99mTc][Tc(CO)3(H2O)3]+ synthon to form desired radioactive complexes 9 and 10. The radiolabeling yields of the complexes obtained were >90% as confirmed by radio-HPLC. The HPLC purified complexes were used for in vitro and in vivo evaluation to understand the true biological efficacy. Structural characterization of the radiolabeled complexes was carried after synthesizing and characterizing their Re-analogues.Cell uptake studies with the radiolabeled complexes in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell lines revealed reduced uptake in the cells (<1% of incubated radioactivity/106 cells) in comparison to n.c.a. [125I]mIBG (~12%). However, limited specificity (~60%) was observed for the complexes as ascertained through desmethylimipramine (DMI) inhibition. Biodistribution studies in normal Wistar rats exhibited desired non-target clearance pharmacokinetics for the complexes but in vivo NET efficacy in myocardium for the neutral complex 10 could not be established.Tridentate [99mTc]Tc(CO)31+ chelation approach severely affects biological behavior of the present small bioactive molecule under study to a significant extent in comparison to monodentate ligation in 99mTc-4\u202f+\u202f1 strategy.",

In this article, we describe an efficient and facile method for radiochemical separation of 90Y from 90Sr for preparation of radiopharmaceuticals by exploiting the large difference in the solubility product constants (Ksp) of Y(OH)3 and Sr(OH)2.A two-step radiochemical separation procedure based on selective precipitation of 90Y under alkaline conditions from 90Sr/90Y equilibrium mixture was developed. The 90Y(OH)3 colloid formed at pH\u202f~\u202f10 was selectively trapped in 0.22\u202f\u03bcm sterile filter and was subsequently retrieved by dissolution in HCl solution. Detailed quality control analyses of obtained 90Y were carried out and its utility towards preparation of different radiopharmaceuticals was assessed.Using the same feed solution of 90Sr (3.7\u202fGBq), consistent and repeated separation of 90Y could be achieved in different batches with >85% yield and >99.999% radionuclidic purity. Yttrium-90 obtained from this process was found suitable for preparation of therapeutically relevant doses of three different radiopharmaceutical formulations, namely, 90Y-DOTA-TATE, 90Y-PSMA-617 and 90Y-CHX-A\u2033-DTPA-Cetuximab with >95% radiochemical purity.The promising results obtained in this study would facilitate implementation of the developed technique for obtaining 90Y in adequate quantity and of required purity from a centralized radiopharmacy setup.",

Despite numerous studies reported interesting and solid data about the prognostic value of the presence of inflammatory infiltrate in cancers, the biological role of inflammation in prostate cancer development is not yet fully clarified. The characterization of molecular pathways that connect altered inflammatory response and prostate cancer progression can provide the scientific rationale for the identification of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Specifically, the detection of infiltrating immune cells or related-cytokines by histology and/or by molecular imaging techniques could profoundly change the management of prostate cancer patients. In this context, the anatomic pathology and imaging diagnostic teamwork can provide a valuable support for the validation of new targets for diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer lesions associated to the inflammatory infiltrate. The aim of this review is to summarize the current literature about the role of molecular imaging technique and anatomic pathology in the study of the mutual interaction occurring between prostate cancer and inflammation.

The translocator protein 18\u202fkDa (TSPO), due to its overexpression during microglial activation and relatively low levels in the brain under normal neurophysiological conditions, is commonly used as an in vivo biomarker for neuroinflammation. Reported here is the preclinical evaluation of [18F]F-DPA, a promising new TSPO-specific radioligand, as a tool for the detection of activated microglia at different ages in the APP/PS1-21 mouse model of AD and a blocking study to determine the specificity of the tracer.[18F]F-DPA was synthesised by the previously reported electrophilic 18F-fluorination methodology. In vivo PET and ex vivo brain autoradiography were used to observe the tracer distribution in the brains of APP/PS1-21 and wildtype mice at different ages (4.5\u201324\u202fmonths). The biodistribution and degree of metabolism of [18F]F-DPA were analysed and the specificity of [18F]F-DPA for its target was determined by pre-treatment with PK11195.The in vivo PET imaging and ex vivo brain autoradiography data showed that [18F]F-DPA uptake in the brains of the transgenic animals increased with age, however, there was a drop in the tracer uptake at 19\u202fmo. Despite the slight increase in [18F]F-DPA uptake with age in healthy animal brains, significant differences between wildtype and transgenic animals were seen in vivo at 9\u202fmonths and ex vivo already at 4.5\u202fmonths. The specificity study demonstrated that PK11195 can be used to significantly block [18F]F-DPA uptake in all the brain regions studied.In vivo time activity curves plateaued at approximately 20\u201340\u202fmin suggesting that this is the optimal imaging time. Significant differences in vivo are seen at 9 and 12\u202fmo. Due to the higher resolution, ex vivo autoradiography with [18F]F-DPA can be used to visualise activated microglia at an early stage of AD pathology.",

In addition to glucose, cancer cells utilize Gln as a carbon source for ATP production, biosynthesis, and as a defense against reactive oxygen species. The utilization of [11C]Gln has been previously reported as a biomarker for tissues with an elevated demand for Gln, however, the previous reports for the preparation of [11C]Gln were found to be lacking several crucial aspects necessary for transition to human production. Namely, the presence of unreacted precursor and the use of non-commercialized, custom built, reaction platforms. Herein, we report the development and utilization of methodology for the automated production of [11C]Gln that meets institutional criteria for human use.The preparation of [11C]Gln was carried out on the GE FX2N platform. Briefly, after trapping of [11C]HCN with a solution of CsHCO3 in DMF, the [11C]CsCN was reacted with a commercially available precursor. This intermediate was then purified by HPLC and deprotected/hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. Following pH adjustment, the product was filtered to give the desired [11C]Gln as a sterile injectable. The resulting product was then analyzed for quality assurance.Automated production by this method reliably provides over 3.7\u202fGBq (100\u202fmCi) of [11C]Gln. The resulting final drug product was found to have a >99% radiochemical purity, <5% of D-Gln present, no detectable impurities, and the total preparation time was roughly 45\u202fmin from the end-of-bombardment.A fast, reliable and efficient automated radiosynthesis was developed using a commercially available module.

Discernable in vivo cerebellar [3H]QNB binding has been observed in mouse brain, despite the maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) being low. In order to understand this unique in vivo binding phenomenon, the binding of two muscarinic receptor ligands \u2013 [3H]QNB and N-[11C]methylpiperidyl Benzilate ([11C]NMPB) \u2013 were compared in vivo and in vitro in 3- and 8-week-old mice.In vitro binding parameters of [3H]QNB were determined using brain homogenates.

A graphical method was employed for the quantitative analysis of in vivo binding of these radioligands.In vitro, the available number of binding sites for cerebral cortical muscarinic receptors increased by 17% during the developmental period studied. Paradoxically, in vivo, we observed a decrease of [3H]QNB binding in the cerebral cortex, while [11C]NMPB binding was markedly increased. In vivo saturation analysis of [3H]QNB in 3-week-old mice revealed an apparent positive cooperativity of binding in the cerebral cortex.Our results support the hypothesis that microenvironmental factors proximal to muscarinic receptors cause a local decrease in the cortical free-ligand concentration of [3H]QNB and that this \u2018ligand barrier\u2019 is modulated during brain development.The present study demonstrates that the combined use of radiolabeled QNB and NMPB has the potential to reveal the important effects of receptor microenvironmental factors on receptor function in the living brain.",

One of these requirements is high specific or molar activity of the radiotracer in order to avoid e.g. receptor saturation and pharmacological or even toxic effects of the applied tracer for positron emission tomography. In the case of 11C-labeled radiotracers, the reasons for low molar activity are manifold and often the search for potential 12C-contaminations is time-consuming.In this study, diverse 12C-contaminations were analyzed and quantified, which occurred during >450 syntheses of six PET tracers using [11C]CO2 or [11C]CH3I generated via the gas phase method in a commercially available synthesizer. Additionally, non-radioactive syntheses were performed in order to identify the origins of carbon-12.The manifold contributions to low molar activity can be attributed to three main categories, namely technical parameters (e.g. quality of target gases, reagents or tubings), inter/intralaboratory parameters (e.g. maintenance interval, burden of the module, etc.) and interoperator parameters (e.g. handling of the module).Our study provides a better understanding of different factors contributing to the overall carbon load of a synthesis module, which facilitates maintenance of high molar activity of carbon-11-labeled radiopharmaceuticals.",

Glycosylation can also improve the bioavailability, in vivo kinetics, and stability of the compound in blood, as well as accelerate clearance of biomolecules. A typical synthesis procedure for 18F-fluoroglycosylation with [18F]FDG (2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose) and [18F]FDR (5-deoxy-5-[18F]fluoro-d-ribose) involves two HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) purifications: one after 18F-fluorination of the carbohydrate to remove its labeling precursor, and a second one after the oxime formation step to remove the aminooxy precursor. The two HPLC purifications can be time consuming and complicate the adaptation of the synthetic strategy in nuclear medicine applications and automated synthesis. We have developed a procedure in which SPE (solid phase extraction) and resin purification methods replace both of the needed HPLC purification steps.We used [18F]FDR and [18F]FDG as prosthetic groups to radiolabel two aminooxy-modified model molecules, a tetrazine and a PSMA (prostate specific membrane antigen) inhibitor. After fluorination, the excess carbohydrate precursor was removed by derivatizing it with 4,4\u2032-dimethoxytrityl chloride (DMT-Cl). The DMT moiety increases the hydrophobicity of the unreacted precursor making the separation from the fluorinated precursor possible with simple C18 Sep-Pak cartridge. For removal of the aminooxy precursor, we used a commercially available aldehyde resin (AminoLink, Thermo Fisher Scientific). C18 Sep-Pak SPE cartridge was used to separate [18F]FDR and [18F]FDG from the 18F-fluoroglycoconjugate end product.[18F]FDR and [18F]FDG were efficiently purified from their precursors, free fluorine-18, and other impurities. The aldehyde resin quantitatively removed the unreacted aminooxy precursors after the oxime formation. The fluorine-18 labeled oxime end products were obtained with high radiochemical purity (>99%) and molar activity (>600\u202fGBq\u202f\u03bcmol\u22121).We have developed an efficient cartridge purification method for producing high molar activity 18F-glycoconjugates synthesized via oxime formation.",

Mice bearing these tumors were treated with T-DM1 (3.6\u202fmg/kg every 3\u202fweeks) and the tumor doubling time estimated by fitting of tumor volume vs. time curves. A tumor doubling time ratio (TDR) was calculated by dividing the doubling time for T-DM1 and normal saline treated control mice.

Tumor intensity on microPET/CT images was proportional to HER2 expression. The standard uptake value (SUV) for the tumors on the images was strongly correlated with the T/B ratio in biodistribution studies. There was a direct linear correlation between the T/B ratio for 89Zr-DFO-T-DM1 and TDR, with TDR ranging from 0.9 for MDA-MB-231 to 1.6 for MDA-MB-361 and 2.1 for BT-474 tumors. The cytotoxicity of T-DM1 in vitro on BC cells was dependent on HER2 expression but T-DM1 was more potent than trastuzumab. There was an inverse correlation between the TDR for mice treated with T-DM1 and CS of BC cells exposed in vitro to T-DM1.Based on the direct correlations between the T/B ratio for 89Zr-DFO-T-DM1 by PET and HER2 expression and response to T-DM1, our results suggest that PET with 89Zr-DFO-T-DM1 may predict response of HER2-positive BC to treatment with T-DM1.Our results suggest that PET with 89Zr-DFO-T-DM1 may predict response to treatment with T-DM1 in HER-positive BC.",

We investigated whether prolonging blood residence time of [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE with albumin binders could increase tumour accumulation and tumour-to-kidney ratios for improved therapeutic efficacy.DOTATATE and its derivatives with an albumin-binder motif (GluAB-DOTATATE and AspAB-DOTATATE) were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Binding affinities of the Lu-labeled peptides for human somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) were measured with membrane competition binding assays. Compounds were radiolabeled with [177Lu]LuCl3 and purified by HPLC. SPECT imaging and biodistribution studies (1, 4, 24, 72, and 120\u202fh) were performed in immunodeficient mice bearing AR42J pancreatic tumour xenografts.GluAB-DOTATATE and AspAB-DOTATATE were synthesized in 18.8% and 14.3% yields, while Lu-GluAB-DOTATATE and Lu-AspAB-DOTATATE were obtained in 86.5% and 50.0% yields, respectively. The compounds exhibited nanomolar binding affinity (Ki: 8.72\u20138.95\u202fnM) for SSTR2. The 177Lu-labeled peptides were obtained in non-decay-corrected isolated yields of \u226541%, with >96% radiochemical purity, and molar activities in the range of 314\u2013497\u202fGBq/\u03bcmol. In vivo, [177Lu]Lu-GluAB-DOTATATE and [177Lu]Lu-AspAB-DOTATATE had significantly higher blood activity at 1, 4 and 24\u202fh compared to [177Lu]Lu-DOTATATE.

For [177Lu]Lu-GluAB-DOTATATE tumour uptake increased from 21.89\u202f\u00b1\u202f6.86%ID/g at 1\u202fh to 24.44\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.84%ID/g at 4\u202fh, before decreasing to 12.02\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.84%ID/g at 120\u202fh.

[99mTc]duramycin can selectively target an apoptosis biomarker: phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which is normally located on the intracellular cell-membrane surface but redistributes onto the outer cell-membrane upon apoptosis. Therefore, 99mTc-duramycin is a potential probe for non-invasive detection of apoptosis in real-time. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of [99mTc]duramycin for detecting early apoptotic response in tumors after chemotherapy, thus providing a tool for early prediction of curative effects in tumors.Human breast cancer MDA-MB-468 model mice, randomly divided into two groups, were injected with cisplatin or vehicle once per day. [99mTc]duramycin imaging was performed for group 1 before treatment and 24\u202fh after the third day of treatment to evaluate treatment response through animal single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT/CT). Mice in group 2 were treated for 10\u202fdays consecutively, to observe treatment response by tumor volume changes. Treatment response was further demonstrated through TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3).[99mTc]duramycin uptake in MDA-MB-468 tumors was significantly higher in the treatment group than the control group after as few as 3\u202fdays of cisplatin treatment (p\u202f=\u202f0.0001), and it also increased after treatment as comparison with that before treatment (p\u202f=\u202f0.0001). Moreover, [99mTc]duramycin uptake in tumors clearly correlated with immunohistochemistry results (TUNEL: r\u202f=\u202f0.892, p\u202f=\u202f0.0001, and CC3: r\u202f=\u202f0.89, p\u202f=\u202f0.0001). Additionally, tumor size reduction, indicating effective treatment, was not observed until the eighth day after treatment, far later than the time when diagnosis could be made through [99mTc]duramycin imaging.[99mTc]duramycin SPECT/CT provides a non-invasive molecular imaging strategy for early detection of tumor apoptosis after chemotherapy and thus may have great potential value in the clinic.",

Because of this, PARP-1 has been targeted for therapy in PC, and non-invasive imaging of PARP-1 could help predict which patients are likely to respond to such therapy. Several PARP-1 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents have been developed and show promise for imaging PARP-1 expression in breast, brain, and lung cancer in small animals, but not as yet in prostate cancer. [18F]WC-DZ-F is an analogue of [18F]FluorThanatrace (FTT) and [125I]KX1, which are well-established PARP-1 ligands for measuring PARP-1 expression. Herein, we evaluated the potential of [18F]WC-DZ-F for the imaging PARP-1 expression in PC.[18F]WC-DZ-F was synthesized by a two-step sequence. [18F]WC-DZ-F was evaluated by in vitro uptake studies in PC-3 cells and by in vivo biodistribution and microPET imaging using PC-3 tumor xenografts. Ex vivo autoradiography of PC-3 tumors after microPET imaging was also performed.[18F]WC-DZ-F has high, PARP-1-specific uptake in PC-3 cells. In the microPET imaging study, [18F]WC-DZ-F accumulated in PC-3 xenograft tumors over 2\u202fh, and the uptake was significantly reduced by blocking with olaparib. PC-3 tumors were clearly visualized in microPET images, and the imaging results were further confirmed by autoradiography of PC-3 tumors ex vivo. In the biodistribution study [18F]WC-DZ-F washed out quickly from most tissues within 2\u202fh, except for the liver in which the uptake was not blockable by olaparib.We synthesized a novel PARP-1 radioligand, [18F]WC-DZ-F. The preliminary evaluation of [18F]WC-DZ-F indicates that it is a suitable PET imaging agent for measuring PARP-1 expression in prostate cancer and should be applicable to other types of cancers.",

     "abstract": "The development of clinically useful tracers for PET imaging is enormously challenging and expensive. The intranasal (IN) route of administration is purported to be a viable route for delivering drugs to the brain but has, as yet, not been investigated for the delivery of PET tracers. If the intranasal (IN) pathway presents a viable option, it extends the PET imaging field by increasing the number of tracers available for human use.Here we report the results of a rodent study testing the feasibility of the IN route to administer radiotracers for brain PET imaging.We used two different, well characterised, brain penetrant radiotracers, [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) and [18F]fallypride, and aimed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics after administration of the tracers via the intranasal route, and contrast this to intravenous administration. Image acquisition was carried out after tracer administration and arterial blood samples were collected at different time intervals, centrifuged to extract plasma and gamma counted. We hypothesised that [brain region]:[plasma] ratios would be higher via the intranasal route as there are two inputs, one directly from the nose to the brain, and another from the peripheral circulation. To assess the feasibility of using this approach clinically, we used these data to estimate radiation dosimetry in humans.Contrary to our hypothesis, in case of both radiotracers, we did not see a higher ratio in the expected brain regions, except in the olfactory bulb, that is closest to the nose. It appears that the radiotracers move into the olfactory bulb region, but then do not progress further into other brain regions. Moreover, as the nasal cavity has a small surface area, the extrapolated dosimetry estimations for intranasal human imaging showed an unacceptably high level (15\u202fmSv/MBq) of cumulative skin radiation exposure.Therefore, although an attractive route for brain permeation, we conclude that the intranasal route would present difficulties due to non-specific signal and radiation dosimetry considerations for brain PET imaging.",

The formation of this complex appears to require 89Zr-chloride as the complexation precursor rather than the more conventional 89Zr-oxalate. In this work we present a method for the direct isolation of 89Zr-chloride from irradiated natY foils.89Zr, 88Zr, and 88Y were prepared by 16\u202fMeV proton irradiation of natY foils and used for batch-extraction based equilibrium coefficient measurements for TBP and UTEVA resin. Radionuclidically pure 89Zr was prepared by 14\u202fMeV proton-irradiation of natY foils. These foils were dissolved in concentrated HCl, trapped on columns of TBP or UTEVA resin, and 89Zr-chloride was eluted in <1\u202fmL of 0.1\u202fM HCl. For purposes of comparison, conventionally-isolated 89Zr-oxalate was converted to 89Zr-chloride by trapping, rinsing, and elution from a QMA cartridge into 1\u202fM HCl. Trace metal analysis was performed on the resulting 89Zr products.Equilibrium coefficients for Y and Zr were similar between UTEVA and TBP resins across all HCl concentrations. Kd values of <10\u22121\u202fmL/g were observed for Y across all HCl concentrations. Kd values of >103\u202fmL/g were observed at HCl concentrations >9\u202fM for Zr, falling to Kd values of <100\u202fmL/g at low HCl concentrations. 89Zr-chloride was recovered from small columns of TBP in <1\u202fmL of 0.1\u202fM HCl with an overall recovery efficiency of 89\u202f\u00b1\u202f3% (n\u202f=\u202f3). An average Y/Zr separation factor of 1.5\u202f\u00d7\u202f105 (n\u202f=\u202f3) was obtained. Trace metal impurities, notably Fe, were higher in TBP-isolated 89Zr-chloride compared with 89Zr-chloride prepared using the conventional two-step procedure.TBP-functionalized resin appears promising for the direct isolation of 89Zr-chloride from irradiated natY targets. Excellent 89Zr recovery efficiencies were obtained, and chemical purity was sufficient for proof-of-concept chelation studies.",

Am for the [18F]fluoride was determined and compared with the Am of [18F]fluciclatide, synthesized from the same [18F]fluoride containing batches of water.Significantly higher concentrations of fluoride were seen in irradiated water that was transported in fluorinated tubing compared to non-irradiated water transported in tubing of the same material. This elevation of fluoride concentration is presumably caused by the interaction of ionizing radiation with the fluorinated tubing used between the target chamber and hot cell. Likewise, a significant difference was seen for PEEK tubing (non-fluorinated). This could be due to the fact that fluorine containing compounds are used in the manufacture of PEEK.When using fluorinated tubing for transport of the irradiated water, the resulting fluciclatide concentrations were significantly higher compared to when using non-fluorinated tubing. No significant difference was seen between fluciclatide concentrations when PTFE or ETFE tubing was compared to each other. Using no tubing resulted in lowest fluciclatide concentration.Fluorinated tubing is a source of stable fluoride, and Am can be increased by using non-fluorinated transport tubing. Of all the tubing materials studied PP is preferred.",

Therefore, we developed a semi-automatic system specifically to overcome these problems. A difficulty appeared unexpectedly, as intrinsic trace metals derived from eluate (Zn, Fe and Cu) are concentrated as well in amounts that influence radiochemical yield and thus lower molar activity.To purify Gallium-68 and to reduce the high elution volume of a 68Ga-generator, a NaCl-based method using a column containing PS-H+ was implemented in a low volume PEEK system.

Setting the uptake value of post-nephrectomy pancreatic ROIs as 100%, the uptake estimated from pre-nephrectomy images was comparable (102.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.2%). A strong correlation was observed between pancreatic radioactivity measured by curiemeter and the uptake value derived from in-vivo SPECT/CT imaging (r\u202f=\u202f0.90, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).Our analytical method without nephrectomy or additional probes enables reliable quantification of the pancreatic uptake of 111In-labeled exendin-4 using in-vivo SPECT/CT imaging. The quantification of rodent BCM with our method would be helpful to drug development.",

The optical purity was measured by HPLC. Radioactive chemical forms in the arterial blood of Sprague Dawley rats with or without insulin pretreatment were evaluated by HPLC 10\u202fmin after bolus intravenous injection of l-[3-11C]lactate. PET scans were performed on normal and fasted rats administered with l-[3-11C]lactate.l-[3-11C]Lactate was synthesized within 50\u202fmin and had decay corrected radiochemical yield, radiochemical purity, and optical purity of 13.4%, >95%, and >99%, respectively. The blood radioactivity peaked immediately after l-[3-11C]lactate injection, rapidly decreased to the minimum value within 90\u202fs, and slowly cleared thereafter. HPLC analysis of blood samples revealed the presence of [11C]glucose (78.9%) and l-[3-11C]lactate (12.1%) 10\u202fmin after administration of l-[3-11C]lactate. Insulin pretreatment partly inhibited glyconeogenesis conversion leading to 55.4% as [11C]glucose and 38.9% as l-[3-11C]lactate simultaneously. PET analysis showed a higher SUV in the brain tissue of fasted rats relative to non-fasted rats.We successfully synthesized l-[3-11C]lactate in a one-pot enzymatic synthetic procedure and showed rapid metabolic conversion of l-[3-11C]lactate to [11C]glucose in the blood.

(2) In vivo tumor uptake was assessed in xenografted mice and total body distribution was evaluated in a cynomolgus monkey using [11C]YM155 with PET/computed tomography (CT) (mice) and PET (monkey) imaging.Intracellular uptake of YM155 in human cancer cell lines correlated well with its in vitro efficacy measured by GI50 (Pearson's r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.5709). Similarly, in vivo studies using tumor xenografted mice showed that tumors sensitive to YM155 demonstrated robust uptake of [11C]YM155, whereas insensitive tumors demonstrated low uptake. In the monkey, the biodistribution of [11C]YM155 indicated low accumulation in lung, breast, head, and neck and was only significant in organs involved with drug clearance: i.e. liver, kidneys, and bladder.Robust uptake of [11C]YM155 by a tumor appears to be a positive predictive marker for a good response to YM155. The findings suggest the potential utility of PET/CT imaging with [11C]YM155 for selection of patients whose tumors are likely to respond to YM155.YM155 efficacy correlated closely with its in vitro intracellular uptake and uptake on [11C]YM155 PET imaging. [11C]YM155 PET may predict tumor sensitivity to YM155.The concept that tumor response can be accurately predicted prior to chemotherapy should be exploited to improve cancer treatment outcomes through judicious patient selection. The small molecule sepantronium bromide (YM155), a survivin suppressant, has been developed for the treatment of several cancers, including non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and breast cancer. The preferentially high in vitro uptake of YM155 by YM155-sensitive cancer cells and the high in vivo uptake of [11C]YM155 in YM155-sensitive tumors demonstrated by PET imaging suggest the potential utility of performing [11C]YM155 PET to allow the identification of patients with YM155-sensitive tumors.",

     "abstract": "Non-invasive imaging of COX-2 in cancer represents a powerful tool for assessing COX-2-mediated effects on chemoprevention and radiosensitization using potent and selective COX-2 inhibitors as an emerging class of anticancer drugs. Careful assessment of the pharmacokinetic profile of radiolabeled COX-2 inhibitors is of crucial importance for the development of suitable radiotracers for COX-2 imaging in vivo. The delicate balance between the selection of typical COX-2 pharmacophores and the resulting physicochemical characteristics of the COX-2 inhibitor represents a formidable challenge for the search of radiolabeled COX-2 imaging agents. Several pyrimidine-based COX-2 inhibitors demonstrated favorable in vitro and in vivo COX-2 imaging properties in various COX-2 expressing cancer cell lines. Here, we describe a comparative radiopharmacological study of three 18F-labeled COX-2 inhibitors based on a pyrimidine scaffold. The objective of this study was to investigate how subtle structural alterations influence the pharmacokinetic profile of lead compound [18F]1a ([18F]Pyricoxib) to afford 18F-labeled pyrimidine-based COX-2 inhibitors with improved COX-2 imaging properties in vivo.Radiosynthesis of radiotracers was accomplished through reaction with 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl amine on a methyl-sulfone labeling precursor ([18F]1a and [18F]2a) or late-stage radiofluorination using a iodyl-containing labeling precursor ([18F]3a). Radiopharmacological profile of 18F-labeled pyrimidine-based COX-2 inhibitors [18F]1a, [18F]2a and [18F]3a was studied in COX-2-expressing human HCA-7 colorectal cancer cell line, including cellular uptake studies in HCA-7 cells and dynamic PET imaging studies in HCA-7 xenografts.Cellular uptake of radiotracers [18F]2a and [18F]3a in HCA-7 cells was 450% and 300% radioactivity/mg protein, respectively, after 90\u202fmin incubation, compared to 600% radioactivity/mg protein for radiotracer [18F]1a. Dynamic PET imaging studies revealed a tumor SUV of 0.53 ([18F]2a) and 0.54 ([18F]3a) after 60\u202fmin p.i. with a tumor-to-muscle ratio of ~1. Tumor SUV for [18F]1a (60\u202fmin p.i.) was 0.76 and a tumor-to-muscle ratio of ~1.5. Pyricoxib analogues [18F]2a and [18F]3a showed distinct pharmacokinetic profiles in comparison to lead compound [18F]1a with a significantly improved lung clearance pattern.Replacing the 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl amine motif in radiotracer [18F]1a with a 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl alcohol motif in radiotracer [18F]3a resulted in re-routing of the metabolic pathway as demonstrated by a more rapid liver clearance and higher initial kidney uptake and more rapid kidney clearance compared to radiotracers [18F]1a and [18F]2a. Moreover, radiotracer [18F]3a displayed favorable rapid brain uptake and retention.The radiopharmacological profile of three 18F-labeled COX-2 inhibitors based on a pyrimidine scaffold were evaluated in COX-2 expressing human colorectal cancer cell line HCA-7 and HCA-7 xenografts in mice. Despite the overall structural similarity and comparable COX-2 inhibitory potency of all three radiotracers, subtle structural alterations led to significantly different in vitro and in vivo metabolic profiles.Among all tested pyrimidine-based 18F-labeled COX-2 inhibitors, lead compound [18F]1a remains the most suitable radiotracer for assessing COX-2 expression in vivo. Radiotracer [18F]3a showed significantly improved first pass pulmonary passage in comparison to radiotracer [18F]1a and might represents a promising lead compound for the development of radiotracers for PET imaging of COX-2 in neuroinflammation.",

The goal of the current study was to investigate the use of brush border enzyme-cleavable linkers as a strategy for reducing kidney activity levels from radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors.PSMA-769 (6), a derivative of the prototypical PSMA inhibitor (((S)\u20111\u2011carboxy\u20115\u2011(4\u2011iodobenzamido)pentyl)carbamoyl)glutamate (12) modified to contain a Gly-Tyr linker, and its protected tin precursor (11) were synthesized starting from the basic pharmacophore molecule Lys-urea-Glu. An analogue of 6 containing d\u2011tyrosine in lieu of l\u2011tyrosine (PSMA-769-d-tyrosine) and the corresponding tin precursor (d-11) also were synthesized. Both radioiodinated and 211At-labeled 6 were synthesized by radiohalogenation of 11 and deprotection in situ. Similarly, radioiodinated d-6 was synthesized from d-11. Paired label biodistribution of [125I]12 and [131I]6 was performed in normal mice and in SCID mice bearing both PC3 PIP (PSMA+) and PC3 flu (PSMA\u2212) subcutaneous prostate carcinoma xenografts. The biodistribution of [131I]6 and [211At]6 was also evaluated in this tumor model. Biodistribution of the two radioiodinated diastereomers of 6 was evaluated in normal mice and urine samples were analyzed for the presence of 4\u2011iodohippuric acid.Compounds [131I]6 and [211At]6 were synthesized from 11 in overall radiochemical yields of 32.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1% (n\u202f=\u202f4) and 22% (n\u202f=\u202f1), respectively; radiochemical purity was >95%.

In tumor-bearing mice, kidney uptake of [131I]6 was similar to that for [125I]12 (P\u202f>\u202f0.05) at 1\u202fh and 4\u202fh but was 6- to 7-fold lower at 21\u202fh; however, [131I]6 uptake in PC3 PIP tumors was also lower than that seen for [125I]12 at 21\u202fh (12.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.4%ID/g vs. 36.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.4%ID/g). Uptake of [211At]PSMA-769 in PC3 PIP tumors was slightly higher than that seen for [131I]PSMA-769 at 4\u202fh (9.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6%ID/g versus 7.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.6%ID/g; P\u202f=\u202f0.002); its uptake in a number of normal tissues also was higher. In normal mice, kidney uptake of [125I]PSMA-769 at 4\u202fh was about 73% of that seen for [131I]PSMA-769-d-tyrosine. Activity in the urine of mice receiving [125I]PSMA-769 contained mainly 4\u2011[125I]iodohippuric acid while unmetabolized intact molecule was present in the case of [125I]PSMA-769-d-tyrosine.Use of this brush border enzyme-cleavable linker reduced kidney uptake and resulted in improved tumor:kidney uptake ratios. Although further structural improvements are needed, this linker approach might be useful as a component in strategies for reducing renal uptake of radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors.",

Rat biodistributions and whole-body PET imaging over a 4\u202fh time course were used for the in vivo evaluation.This synthesis exhibited an overall radiochemical yield of 45\u202f\u00b1\u202f10% (n\u202f=\u202f30), a 50-min radiolabeling time, a radiochemical purity >99% and apparent stability up to 4\u202fh in human serum. Blood had the highest retention of Al[18F]F-NODA-Bz-RSA at all times with a blood half-life of 5.2\u202fh in rats. Al[18F]F-NODA-Bz-RSA distribution in most rat tissues remained relatively constant for up to 1\u202fh, indicating that the tissue radioactivity content represents the respective tissue plasma volume. Dynamic whole-body PET images were in agreement with these findings.A new ligand has been developed and radiolabeled with Al[18F]F that allows rapid (50-min) preparation of fluorine-18 serum albumin in one-pot. In addition to increased synthetic efficiency, the construct appears to be metabolically stable in rats. This method could encourage wider use of PET to quantify cardiac function and tissue vascular integrity in both research and clinical settings.",

We herein describe methods to metallate and characterize the new conjugate and to validate its biological efficacy by in vitro and in vivo methods.We have previously described the development of [RGD-Glu-6Ahx-RM2] (where RGD: Arg-Gly-Asp; Glu: glutamic acid; 6-Ahx: 6-amino hexanoic acid; RM2: (D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2)) that has been conjugated to a DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid) bifunctional chelating agent (BFCA) to afford [RGD-Glu-[DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] peptide. In this study, we have radiolabeled [RGD-Glu-[DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] peptide with 86Y or 90Y. Natural-metallated (natY) conjugates were assessed for binding affinity for the \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin or GRPR in human glioblastoma U87-MG and prostate PC-3 cell lines, respectively. The effective stability of the new tracers was also evaluated prior to in vivo evaluation in normal CF-1 mice and SCID mice bearing xenografted tumors.Competitive displacement binding assays in PC-3 cells showed high binding affinity for the GRPR (IC50, 5.65\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.00\u202fnM). On the other hand, competitive displacement binding assays in U87-MG cells revealed only moderate binding to the \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin (IC50, 346\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.30\u202fnM). Biodistribution studies in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice [RGD-Glu-[[90Y]Y-DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] showed high tumor uptake (8.70\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.35%ID/g at 1\u202fh post-intravenous injection) and retention of tracer (5.28\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12%ID/g) at 24\u202fh post-intravenous injection. Micro-positron emission tomography (microPET) in PC-3 tumor-bearing mice using [RGD-Glu-[[86Y]Y-DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] correlated well with biodistribution investigations over the various time points that were studied.The [RGD-Glu-[[86Y]Y-DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] and [RGD-Glu-[[90Y]Y-DO3A]-6-Ahx-RM2] matched-pair conjugates described herein exhibit favorable microPET and pharmacokinetic profiles and merit further investigations for molecular imaging and/or therapeutic evaluation in larger animal models and potentially humans.The theranostic, heterobivalent, agents described herein perform comparably with other mono- and multivalent conjugates we have reported and offer the potential of improved sensitivity for detecting prostate cancer cells that might exhibit differing profiles of receptor expression on tumor cells in human patients.",

To investigate the in vivo stability of trithiol chelates complexed with no carrier added (nca) radioarsenic, a bifunctional trithiol chelate was developed, and conjugated to bombesin(7\u201314)NH2 as a model peptide.A trithiol-BBN(7\u201314)NH2 bioconjugate and its arsenic complex were synthesized and characterized. The trithiol-BBN(7\u201314)NH2 conjugate was radiolabeled with 77As, its in vitro stability assessed, and biodistribution studies were performed in CF-1 normal mice of free [77As]arsenate and 77As-trithiol- BBN(7\u201314)NH2.The trithiol-BBN(7\u201314)NH2 conjugate, its precursors and its As-trithiol-BBN(7\u201314)NH2 complex were fully characterized. Radiolabeling studies with nca 77As resulted in over 90% radiochemical yield of 77As-trithiol-BBN, which was stable for over 48\u202fh.

The peptidomimetic, LLP2A, is a high-affinity ligand with specificity for the extracellular portion of VLA-4 and several conjugates have been evaluated in vivo by NIR-fluorescence, 111In-SPECT and 68Ga- and 64Cu-PET imaging, but to date, not with 18F-PET.Using two highly stable organotrifluoroborate prosthetic groups: ammoniumdimethyl-trifluoroborate (AMBF3) and a new N-pyridinyl-para-trifluoroborate (N-Pyr-p-BF3), both capable of facile aqueous 18F-labeling by isotope exchange (IEX), we present the first PET imaging evaluations of two [18F]R-BF3\u2212\u2013PEG2-LLP2A tracers using VLA-4 overexpressing B16-F10 murine melanoma tumor mouse models.Here, we demonstrate successful one-step 18F-labeling of both conjugates with wet NCA [18F]F\u2212 in radiochemical yields of up to 11.6% within 75\u202fmin at molar activities of 40\u2013100\u202fGBq/\u03bcmol.

     "abstract": "Platelets play a major role in thrombo-embolic diseases, notably by forming a thrombus that can ultimately occlude a vessel. This may provoke ischemic pathologies such as myocardial infarction, stroke or peripheral artery diseases, which represent the major causes of death worldwide. The aim of this study was to evaluate the specificity of radiolabeled Rat-Anti-Mouse antibody (RAM.1).We describe a method to detect platelets by using a RAM.1 coupled with the chelating agent hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC) conjugated to 99mTc, for Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT). To induce platelet accumulation at a site of interest, we used a mouse model of FeCl3 induced injury of the carotid artery. 90\u202fmin after i.v. injection of [99mTc][Tc(HYNIC)-RAM.1], biodistribution of the radiolabeled RAM.1 was assessed, SPECT imaging and histological analysis were performed on the mice that underwent FeCl3-induced vessel damage.We demonstrated a quick and strong affinity of the radiolabeled RAM.1 for the platelet thrombus. Results clearly demonstrated the ability of this radioimmunoconjugate for detecting thrombi from 10\u202fmin post injection with an exceptional thrombi uptake. Using FeCl3, the median ratio between the thrombus and the background was 12.4 (range 9.3\u201342.3) as compared to 1.0 (range: 0.86\u20132.7) p\u202f<\u202f0.05 when using 0.9% NaCl.Thanks to the high sensitivity of SPECT, we provided evidence that [99mTc][Tc(HYNIC)-RAM.1] represents a powerful tool to detect localized platelet thrombi which could potentially be used in humans. Because of the relative low cost and high sensitivity, these results encourage further study like the detection of non-induced thrombus and further developments toward clinical application. This is further supported by the fact that RAM.1 recognizes human platelets.",

In a previous study, we synthesized a vesamicol analog, (+)-2-[4-(4-bromophenyl)piperidino]cyclohexanol [(+)-pBrV], with a high affinity for sigma-1 receptor, and synthesized radiobrominated (+)-pBrV. This radiobrominated (+)-pBrV showed high tumor uptake in tumor-bearing mice; however, radioactivity accumulation in normal tissues, such as the liver, was high. We assumed that the accumulation of (+)-pBrV in the non-target tissues was partially derived from its high lipophilicity; therefore, we synthesized and evaluated (+)-4-[1-(2-hydroxycyclohexyl)piperidine-4-yl]-2-bromophenol [(+)-BrV-OH], which is a more hydrophilic compound. Although we aimed to develop a PET tracer using 76Br, in these initial studies, we used 77Br because of its longer half-life.(+)-[77Br]BrV-OH was synthesized using the chloramine-T method with a radiochemical purity of 95%. Lipophilicity and affinity for sigma-1 receptor of (+)-[77Br]BrV-OH were determined, and biodistribution experiments were performed. We also performed an in vivo blocking study by co-injecting excess amounts of the sigma-1 receptor ligand, SA4503, into mice.The lipophilicity and affinity for sigma-1 receptor of (+)-[77Br]BrV-OH were lower than those of (+)-[77Br]pBrV. (+)-[77Br]BrV-OH also showed high tumor uptake in biodistribution experiments in DU-145 tumor-bearing mice,. Although (+)-[77Br]pBrV was retained in most tissues, (+)-[77Br]BrV-OH was cleared from these tissues. In blocking studies, the co-injection of SA4503 significantly decreased the tumor uptake of (+)-[77Br]BrV-OH.These results indicate that (+)-[76Br]BrV-OH has potential as a PET probe for sigma-1 receptor imaging.",

     "abstract": "Peptides labeled with positron-emitting isotopes are emerging as a versatile class of compounds for the development of highly specific, targeted imaging agents for diagnostic imaging via positron-emission tomography (PET) and for precision medicine via theranostic applications. Despite the success of peptides labeled with gallium-68 (for imaging) or lutetium-177 (for therapy) in the clinical management of patients with neuroendocrine tumors or prostate cancer, there are significant advantages of using fluorine-18 for imaging. Recent developments have greatly simplified such labeling: in particular, labeling of organotrifluoroborates via isotopic exchange can readily be performed in a single-step under aqueous conditions and without the need for HPLC purification. Though an automated synthesis has not yet been explored, microfluidic approaches have emerged for 18F-labeling with high speed, minimal reagents, and high molar activity compared to conventional approaches. As a proof-of-concept, we performed microfluidic labeling of an octreotate analog ([18F]AMBF3-TATE), a promising 18F-labeled analog that could compete with [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE with the advantage of providing a greater number of patient doses per batch produced.Both [18F]AMBF3-TATE and [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE were labeled, the former by microscale methods adapted from manual labeling, and were imaged in mice bearing human SSTR2-overexpressing, rat SSTR2 wildtype, and SSTR2-negative xenografts. Furthermore, a dosimetry analysis was performed for [18F]AMBF3-TATE.The micro-synthesis exhibited highly-repeatable performance with radiochemical conversion of 50\u202f\u00b1\u202f6% (n\u202f=\u202f15), overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 16\u202f\u00b1\u202f1% (n\u202f=\u202f5) in ~40\u202fmin, radiochemical purity >99%, and high molar activity. Preclinical imaging with [18F]AMBF3-TATE in SSTR2 tumor models correlated well with [68Ga]Ga-DOTATATE. The favorable biodistribution, with the highest tracer accumulation in the bladder followed distantly by gastrointestinal tissues, resulted in 1.26\u202f\u00d7\u202f10\u22122\u202fmSv/MBq maximal estimated effective dose in human, a value lower than that reported for current clinical 18F- and 68Ga-labeled compounds.The combination of novel chemical approaches to 18F-labeling and microdroplet radiochemistry have the potential to serve as a platform for greatly simplified development and production of 18F-labeled peptide tracers. Favorable preclinical imaging and dosimetry of [18F]AMBF3-TATE, combined with a convenient synthesis, validate this assertion and suggest strong potential for clinical translation.",

Immunofluorescence staining of NMDAR NR1 subunit in brain slices containing lesion was also performed.[18F]-GE-179 was successfully prepared in a yield of 23\u201330% in a formulation that could be injected directly after dilution. Localized radioactivity accumulation was observed in the animal model of MCAO. Significantly higher (p\u202f=\u202f0.0003\u20130.0404) BPND relative to equivalent contralateral was found in the ipsilateral caudate putamen, Acb core/shell, cortex cingulate, amygdala, hypothalamus, and superior colliculus. Immunofluorescence staining showed elevated NMDAR expression in the affected hemisphere.[18F]-GE-179 was synthesized using a one-pot process with a markedly improved yield. Preliminary in vivo micro-PET study visualized excessive NMDAR stimulation successfully in a rodent model of MCAO, which was consistent with results of in vitro immunofluorescence staining.

[18F]FBCGly was investigated in vivo by dynamic PET/MR in anesthetized rats; untreated or treated with cholyltaurine or rifampicin. Possible in vivo metabolites of [18F]FBCGly were investigated by analysis of blood and bile samples, and the stability of [18F]FBCGly towards enzymatic de-conjugation by Cholylglycine Hydrolase was tested in vitro.[18F]FBCGly was produced with a radiochemical purity of 96%\u202f\u00b1\u202f1% and a non-decay corrected radiochemical yield of 1.0%\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3% (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD; n\u202f=\u202f12). PET/MR studies showed that i.v.-administrated [18F]FBCGly underwent EHC within 40\u201360\u202fmin with a rapid transhepatic transport from blood to bile. In untreated rats, the radioactivity concentration of [18F]FBCGly was approximately 15 times higher in bile than in liver tissue.

Differentially expressed genes were identified (treated vs. control) and pathway analysis was performed.Distribution of differentially expressed transcripts indicated a time-dependent treatment response in GOT1 tumors after 177Lu[Lu]-octreotate administration. Regulation of CDKN1A, BCAT1 and PAM at 1\u202fd after injection was compatible with growth arrest as the initial response to treatment. Upregulation of APOE and BAX at 3\u202fd, and ADORA2A, BNIP3, BNIP3L and HSPB1 at 41\u202fd after injection suggests first activation and then inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway during tumor regression and regrowth, respectively.Transcriptional analysis showed radiation-induced apoptosis as an early response after 177Lu[Lu]-octreotate administration, followed by pro-survival transcriptional changes in the tumor during the regrowth phase. Time-dependent changes in cell cycle and apoptosis-related processes suggest different time points after radionuclide therapy when tumor cells may be more susceptible to additional treatment, highlighting the importance of timing when administering multiple therapeutic agents.",

     "abstract": "Glutamine is an essential source of energy, metabolic substrates, and building block for supporting tumor proliferation. Previously, (2S,4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine (4F-Gln) was reported as a glutamine-related metabolic imaging agent. To improve the in vivo kinetics of this radiotracer, two new dipeptides, [18F]Gly-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine (Gly-4F-Gln) and [18F]Ala-(2S,4R)4-fluoroglutamine (Ala-4F-Gln) were investigated.Radiolabeling was performed via 2-steps 18F-fluorination. Cell uptake studies of Gly-4F-Gln and Ala-4F-Gln were investigated in 9\u202fL cell lines. In vitro and in vivo metabolism studies were carried out in Fisher 344 rats. Biodistribution and microPET imaging studies were performed in 9\u202fL tumor-bearing rats.In vitro incubation of these [18F]dipeptides in rat and human blood showed a rapid conversion to (2S,4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine (t1/2\u202f=\u202f2.3 and 0.2\u202fmin for [18F]Gly-4F-Gln and [18F]Ala-4F-Gln, respectively for human blood). Biodistribution and PET imaging in Fisher 344 rats bearing 9\u202fL tumor xenografts showed that these dipeptides rapidly localized in the tumors, comparable to that of (2S,4R)-4-[18F]fluoroglutamine (4F-Gln).The results support that these dipeptides, [18F]Gly-4F-Gln and [18F]Ala-4F-Gln, are prodrugs, which hydrolyze in the blood after an iv injection. They appear to be selectively taken up and trapped by tumor tissue in vivo. The dipeptide, [18F]Ala-4F-Gln, may be suitable as a PET tracer for imaging glutaminolysis in tumors.",

     "abstract": "In drug development, biomarkers for cerebral applications have a lower success rate compared to cardiovascular drugs or tumor therapeutics. One reason is the missing blood brain barrier penetration, caused by the tracer's interaction with efflux transporters such as the P-gp (MDR1 or ABCB1). Aim of this study was the development of a reliable model to measure the interaction of radiotracers with the human efflux transporter P-gp in parallel to the radiolabeling process. LigandTracer\u00ae Technology was used with the wildtype cell line MDCKII and the equivalent cell line overexpressing human P-gp (MDCKII-hMDR1). The method was evaluated based on established PET tracers with known interaction with the human P-gp transporter and in nanomolar concentration (15\u202fnM). [11C]SNAP-7941 and [18F]FE@SNAP were used as P-gp substrates by comparing the real-time model with an uptake assay and \u03bcPET images. [11C]DASB [11C]Harmine, [18F]FMeNER,[18F]FE@SUPPY and [11C]Me@HAPTHI were used as tracers without interactions with P-gp in vitro. However, [11C]Me@HAPTHI shows a significant increase in SUV levels after blocking with Tariquidar. The developed real-time kinetic model uses directly PET tracers in a compound concentration, which is reflecting the in vivo situation. This method may be used at an early stage of radiopharmaceutical development to measure interactions to P-gp before conducting animal experiments.",

     "abstract": "CXCR4 specific [18F]-labeled positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents are needed which would enable general distribution of the radiotracer for clinical investigation. We sought to synthesize, radiolabel and evaluate [18F]RPS-544, a novel non-peptide CXCR4 antagonist as a CXCR4 specific probe. We compared [18F]RPS-544 with the previously published [18F]-3 ([18F]RPS-510 in this paper) in a bi-lateral tumor model of differential CXCR4 expression for its ability to selectively target CXCR4 expression.Radiolabeling of [18F]RPS-544 and [18F]RPS-510 was performed by aromatic substitution on a 6-nitropyridyl group using no-carrier-added [18F]fluoride under basic conditions. 18F incorporation was determined by radioHPLC. Semi-preparative HPLC was used to purify the final product prior to reformulation. Imaging and biodistribution was performed in nude mice with bilateral PC3 (CXCR4+ and WT) xenograft tumors at 1, 2 and 4\u202fh post injection.RPS-544 bound CXCR4 with an IC50 of 4.9\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3\u202fnM. [18F]RPS-544 showed preferential uptake in CXCR4+ tumors, with a CXCR4/WT ratio of 3.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.3 at 1\u202fh p.i. and 2.3\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.5 at 2\u202fh p.i. Maximum uptake in the CXCR4+ tumors was 3.4\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.2%ID/g at 1\u202fh p.i., significantly greater (p\u202f=\u202f0.003) than the uptake in the WT tumor. Tumor/blood ratios were 2.5\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.4 and 3.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.3 at 1 and 2\u202fh p.i. Tumor/muscle ratios were >4 at all time-points. Tumor/lung ratios were >2 at 1\u202fh and 2\u202fh p.i. Substantial uptake was observed in the liver (15\u201325%ID/g), kidneys (25\u201335%ID/g), the small intestine (1\u20137%ID/g) and the large intestine (1\u201312%ID/g). Blood concentrations varied over time (0.5\u20132%ID/g). All other organs showed uptake of <1%ID/g at all time points studied with clearance profiles similar to blood clearance.Here we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first high affinity [18F]-labeled tracer, suitable for in vivo PET imaging of CXCR4. [18F]RPS-544 displayed high affinity for CXCR4 and good tumor uptake with a maximum uptake at 1\u202fh p.i.. CXCR4 dependent uptake was demonstrated using bilateral tumors with differential CXCR4 expression as well as pharmacological blockade using the known CXCR4 antagonist, AMD-3100. Tissue contrast as judged by tumor to normal tissue ratios was positive in several key tissues. The structural and pharmacological similarities between [18F]RPS-544 and the approved drug AMD-3465, combined with the ease of synthesis and high molar activity (>185\u202fGBq/\u03bcmol) achieved during radiosynthesis could lead to accelerated translation into the clinic.",

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the stability and pharmacokinetics of 68Ga- and 64Cu-complexes of the bifunctional chelator NODIA-Me 1 covalently bound to a PSMA targeting vector in vivo.NODIA-Me 1 was conjugated to the PSMA targeting Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys moiety to give the bioconjugate NODIA-Me-NaI-Ahx-PSMA 4. The stability of [68Ga]4 and [64Cu]4 was assessed in vitro by serum stability studies. The PSMA binding affinity was determined in competitive cell experiments in LNCaP cells using 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC as radioligand. The stability and pharmacokinetics of [68Ga]4 and [64Cu]4 was evaluated by PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in mice bearing subcutaneous LNCaP tumors.In human serum, [68Ga]4 and [64Cu]4 remained intact to 85% (3\u202fh) and 92% (24\u202fh), respectively. Nature of the metal chelate influenced PSMA binding affinity with IC50 of 233\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fnM for uncomplexed 4, 681\u202f\u00b1\u202f7\u202fnM for Cu-4 and 176\u202f\u00b1\u202f10\u202fnM for Ga-4. In animal studies, [68Ga]4 and [64Cu]4 revealed low uptake (\u22641% IA g\u22121) in the majority of organs.

In small-animal PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies, 68Ga- and 64Cu-labelled conjugates specifically delineated PSMA-positive LNCaP tumors and exhibited rapid renal clearance from non-target tissues with no significant demetallation/transchelation in vivo. The results support further development of this novel chelating platform for production of 68Ga- and 64Cu-labelled radiopharmaceuticals.",

     "abstract": "Due to their infiltrative growth behavior, gliomas have, even after surgical resection, a high recurrence tendency. The approach of intracavitary radioimmunotherapy (RIT) is aimed at inhibiting tumor re-growth by directly administering drugs into the resection cavity (RC). Direct application of the radioconjugate into the RC has the advantage of bypassing the blood-brain barrier, which allows the administration of higher radiation doses than systemic application. Carbonic anhydrase XII (CA XII) is highly expressed on glioma cells while being absent from normal brain and thus an attractive target molecule for RIT. We evaluated a CA XII-specific 6A10 Fab (fragment antigen binding) labelled with 177Lu as an agent for RIT.6A10 Fab fragment was modified and radiolabelled with 177Lu and characterized by MALDI-TOF, flow cytometry and radio-TLC. In vitro stability was determined under physiological conditions. Biodistribution studies, autoradiography tumor examinations and planar scintigraphy imaging were performed on SCID-mice bearing human glioma xenografts.The in vitro CA XII binding capacity of the modified Fab was confirmed. Radiochemical purity was determined to be >90% after 72\u202fh of incubation under physiological conditions. Autoradiography experiments proved the specific binding of the Fab to CA XII on tumor cells. Biodistribution studies revealed a tumor uptake of 3.0%ID/g after 6\u202fh and no detectable brain uptake. The tumor-to-contralateral ratio of 10/1 was confirmed by quantitative planar scintigraphy.The radiochemical stability in combination with a successful in vivo tumor uptake shows the potential suitability for future RIT applications with the 6A10 Fab.",

For purpose of comparison with a second production facility, additional studies at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke (CHUS) are also described.More than 70% of today's diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals are based on 99mTc, however the conventional supply chain for obtaining 99mTc is fragile. The aim of this work was to demonstrate reliable high yield production and processing of 99mTc with medium-energy, high-current, cyclotrons.We used two cyclotrons (TR-24, Advanced Cyclotron Systems, Inc) for irradiations with 22\u202fMeV or 24\u202fMeV incident energy and 400\u202f\u03bcA current up to a maximum of 6\u202fh. The irradiated 100Mo was dissolved using peroxide, basified using ammonium carbonate, and purified using a PEG-based solid phase extraction technique.High-yield productions with 22\u202fMeV (400\u202f\u03bcA, 6\u202fh) yielded an average isolated [99mTc]TcO4\u2212 yield of 878\u202fGBq\u202f\u00b1\u202f99\u202fGBq (23.7\u202fCi\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.7\u202fCi) decay corrected to EOB, n\u202f=\u202f8 (isolated saturation yield: 4.36\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.49\u202fGBq/\u03bcA). Irradiations with 24\u202fMeV (400\u202f\u03bcA, 6\u202fh) resulted in an average isolated [99mTc]TcO4\u2212 yield of 993\u202fGBq\u202f\u00b1\u202f100\u202fGBq (26.8\u202fCi\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.7\u202fCi) decay corrected to EOB, n\u202f=\u202f7 (isolated saturation yield: 4.97\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.50\u202fGBq/\u03bcA). These yields corresponds to 600\u2013700\u202fGBq (16\u201319\u202fCi) of [99mTc]TcO4\u2212 at release (i.e. 3\u202fhour post-EOB). For all tested batches, the QC results were within the recently published specifications in the European Pharmacopoeia.Reliable near-TBq production yields for 99mTc can be obtained using medium-energy cyclotrons.This work presents evidence that medium-energy high-current cyclotrons can provide high yields of [99mTc]TcO4\u2212 with radionuclidic impurities levels within the specifications of the existing European Pharmacopoeia monograph, indicating that this technology can have a share in the future 99mTc supply market.",

This novel radiotracer targeting NMDA receptor has potential for investigation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.Free fraction and stability in fresh human plasma were determined in vitro. PET/CT was performed on anesthetized rats. Organs were identified and 3D volumes of interest (VOIs) were manually drawn on the CT in the center of each organ. Time activity curves (TACs) were created with these VOIs, enabling the calculation of residence times. To confirm these values, ex vivo measurements of organs were performed. Plasma and urine were also collected to study in vivo metabolism. Data was extrapolated to humans, effective doses were estimated using ICRP-60 and ICRP-89 dosimetric models and absorbed doses were estimated using OLINDA/EXM V1.0 and OLINDA/EXM V2.0 (which use weighting factors from ICRP-103 to do the calculations).The [18F]FNM was stable in human plasma and the diffusible free fraction was 53%. As with memantine, this tracer is poorly metabolized in vivo. Ex vivo distributions validated PET/CT data as well as demonstrating a decrease of radiotracer uptake in the brain due to anesthesia. Total effective dose was around 6.11\u202f\u03bcSv/MBq and 4.65\u202f\u03bcSv/MBq for female and male human dosimetric models, respectively.This study shows that the presented compound exhibits stability in plasma and plasma protein binding very similar to memantine. Its dosimetry shows that it is suitable for use in humans due to a low total effective dose compared to other PET radiotracers.",

Moreover, the potential of 18F\u2013FGA to image myocardial damage was investigated in a rat model of isoproterenol-induced cardiomyopathy. Isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury was verified at necropsy by tissue staining and plasma cardiac troponin levels.Synthesis of radiochemically pure 18F\u2013FGA was accomplished by a 5\u202fmin, one step oxidation of 18F\u2013FDG. Reaction yield was quantitative and no side-products were detected. Biodistribution studies showed rapid elimination from the body (ke\u202f=\u202f0.83\u202fh\u22121); the major organ of 18F\u2013FGA accumulation was kidney. In the rat model, isoproterenol-treatment resulted in significant increase in cardiac troponin. PET images showed that the hearts of isoproterenol-treated rats accumulated significant amounts of 18F\u2013FGA, whereas healthy hearts showed negligible uptake of 18F\u2013FGA. Target-to-nontarget contrast for 18F\u2013FGA accumulation became significantly more pronounced in 4\u202fh images as compared to images acquired 1\u202fh post-injection.18F\u2013FGA can be easily and quantitatively synthesized from ubiquitously available 18F\u2013FDG as a precursor.

Although radioiodine labeled 4-hydroxyphenylcysteamine, which we previously developed, has good affinity for tyrosinase, an enzyme in the melanin metabolic pathway, image contrast of the melanoma:organ ratios is not sufficiently high for detection of primary melanoma and metastases at early injection times. In this study, we developed radioiodine labeled acetaminophen (I-AP) for specific, high-contrast imaging of malignant melanoma.Radioiodine-125-labeled AP (125I-AP) was prepared using the chloramine-T method under no carrier-added conditions. Accumulation of radioactivity and the mechanism were evaluated in vitro using B16 melanoma cells incubated with 125I-AP or 14C(U)-labeled AP (14C-AP) with and without l-tyrosine as a substrate of tyrosinase, phenylthiourea as an inhibitor of tyrosinase, and thymidine as an inhibitor of DNA polymerase. The biological distribution of radioactivity in B16 melanoma-bearing mice was evaluated to determine the accumulation of 125I-AP. The stability of 125I-AP over time was evaluated in mice.The labeling efficiency and radiochemical purity of 125I-AP were >80% and 95%, respectively. Accumulation of 125I-AP was higher than that of 14C-AP at 60\u202fmin of incubation in vitro. The affinity of 14C-AP for tyrosinase and DNA polymerase was higher than that of 125I-AP, whereas the Vmax of 125I-AP was higher than that of 14C-AP. 125I-AP showed the highest accumulation in the gall bladder, and clearance from the blood and kidney was rapid. Melanoma:muscle and melanoma:normal skin ratios of 125I-AP for imaging contrast were the highest at 15\u202fmin after injection, whereas the melanoma:blood and melanoma:bone ratios gradually increased over time. 125I-AP remained stable for 60\u202fmin after injection in mice.125I-AP has affinity for tyrosinase and high image contrast at early time points after injection. Therefore, 123I-AP imaging has great potential for specific, high-contrast detection of malignant melanoma.123I-AP will provide specific, high-contrast imaging for malignant melanoma at early injection times.123I-AP has good potential for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma compared with 123I-labeled 4-hydroxyphenylcysteamine, which we previously developed.",

The PET tracer also demonstrates ability to probe viability of the blood brain barrier (BBB) in WT mice compared with their mdr1a/1b(\u2212/\u2212) (dKO) and mdr1a/1b/ABCG2(\u2212/\u2212/\u2212) (t-KO) counterparts. Herein, we report dosimetry data for 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar in mice, and extrapolate that information to determine effective dose (ED) for human studies.To further assess safety profiles of 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging probe for biomedical imaging in vivo, we estimated human radiation dosimetry extrapolated from mice biodistribution data. To accomplish this objective, 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar was injected intravenously into tails, mice were euthanized, organs harvested (5\u00a0min, 15\u00a0min, 30\u00a0min, 60\u00a0min, 120\u00a0min), counted, radiation doses to each organ, and whole body were also determined.The effective dose (ED) have been found to be 0.021\u00a0mGy/MBq in males and 0.023\u00a0mGy/MBq in females. The highest radiation dose was estimated to the kidneys with a value of 0.17\u00a0mGy/MBq for males and 0.19\u00a0mGy/MBq for females with contribution from activity in the urine prior to excretion. The critical organ in humans has been determined to be the gall bladder. These data provide preliminary projections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates thus providing platform for further validation of dosimetry analysis in human subjects.Combined data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in mice indicate that 68Ga[Ga]-Galmydar would be safe for further evaluation of dosimetry toxicity and myocardial perfusion PET imaging in humans.",

It is know that [68Ga]PSMA 11 ([68Ga]Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-HBED-CC) is the most well studied PET imaging agent for detecting over expressed PSMA binding sites of tumors in humans. In an effort to provide new agents with improved characteristics for PET imaging, we report a novel [68Ga]-Glu-NH-CO-NH-Lys(Ahx)-linker-HBED-CC conjugate with a novel O-(carboxymethyl)-L-tyrosine, as the linker group.Radiosynthesis was performed by a direct method. In vitro binding and cell internalization of [68Ga]10 was investigated in PSMA positive LNCaP cell lines. Biodistribution and MicroPET imaging studies were performed in LNCaP tumor bearing mice.In vitro binding to LNCaP cells showed that natGa labeled O-(carboxymethyl)-L-tyrosine conjugate, [natGa]10, displayed excellent affinity and specificity (IC50\u202f=\u202f16.5\u202fnM) a value comparable to that of PSMA 11. In vitro cell binding and internalization showed excellent uptake and retention; [68Ga]10 displayed significantly higher cellular internalization than [68Ga]PSMA 11 (12.5 vs 7.4% ID/106 cells at 1\u202fh). Biodistribution studies in LNCaP tumor-bearing mice exhibited a high specific uptake in PSMA expressing tumors and fast clearance in normal organs (19.7 tumor/blood; 20.7 tumor/muscle at 1\u202fh after iv injection). MicroPET imaging studies in mice confirmed that [68Ga]10 displayed excellent uptake and distinctive tumor localization, which was blocked by iv injection of a competing drug, 2-PMPA.The preliminary results strongly suggest that [68Ga]10 may be promising candidates as a PET imaging radiotracer for detecting PSMA expression in prostate cancer.",

The physicochemical properties of [18F]FETE were tested in vitro, including determination of the octanol/water partition coefficient, stability and cellular uptake in MCF-7 (ER-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative) cells. An ex vivo biodistribution study was performed in normal Sprague Dawley rats, and in vivo microPET imaging was performed on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice. The results of biodistribution and PET imaging of [18F]FETE were compared with that of known 16\u03b1\u2011[18F]fuoro\u201117\u03b2\u2011estradiol ([18F]FES).

[18F]FETE is a moderate lipophilic compound with good in vitro stability and the total synthesis time was 55 to 65\u202fmin. In biodistribution studies, [18F]FETE showed high uptake in the ER-abundant uterine tissue of normal immature SD rats (8.55\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.21 and 6.83\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.70%ID/g at 1\u202fh after intravenous and intraperitoneal injection, respectively), and could be blocked with estradiol effectively (the uterus uptake was decreased to 0.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.35%ID/g at 1\u202fh after iv injection). MicroPET imaging of tumor-bearing mice with [18F]FETE at 1\u202fh after iv injection revealed considerable uptake in ER-positive MCF-7 tumors (4.63\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.73%ID/g) that could be inhibited (1.47\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.29%ID/g) and low uptake in ER-negative MDA-MB-231 tumors (1.97\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.36%ID/g). [18F]FES has relatively low uptake in ER-positive tumor (0.24\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.19%ID/g) when compared with [18F]FETE. The adult female effective radiation dose of [18F]FETE in mice was estimated as 0.0022\u202fmSv/MBq.A novel 17\u03b1\u2011ethinyl\u2011estradiol-based ER probe [18F]FETE was developed with high molar activity and good in vitro stability.

We compared the production, purification, and antibody radiolabeling yields of 89Zr-(LT) and 89Zr-(ST), and assessed the feasibility of 89Zr-(LT) for preclinical PET/CT.89Zr-(ST) production was performed with an 89Y foil on a TR 19 cyclotron at 13.8\u00a0MeV.

However, some long-lived radionuclidic contaminants of Eu, such as, 154Eu (t\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a08.6\u00a0y) are also produced during the target activation process. This leads to detectable amount of Eu radionuclidic contaminants in patients' skeleton even years after administration with therapeutic doses of 153Sm-EDTMP. Further, the presence of such contaminants in 153Sm raises concerns related to radioactive waste management. The aim of the present study was to develop and demonstrate a viable method for large-scale purification of 153Sm from radionuclidic contaminants of Eu.A radiochemical separation procedure adopting electroamalgamation approach has been critically evaluated. The influence of different experimental parameters for the quantitative removal radionuclidic contaminants of Eu from 153Sm was investigated and optimized. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated by purification of ~\u00a037 GBq of 153Sm in several batches. As a proof of concept, 153Sm-EDTMP was administered in normal Wistar rats and ex vivo \u03b3-spectrometry of bone samples were carried out.After carrying out the electrolysis under the optimized conditions, the radionuclidic contaminants of Eu could not be detected in purified 153Sm solution by \u03b3-spectrometry. The overall yield of 153Sm obtained after the purification process was >\u00a085%. The reliability of this approach was amply demonstrated in several batches, wherein the performance remained consistent. Ex vivo \u03b3-spectrometry of bone samples of Wistar rats administered with 153Sm-EDTMP (prepared using electrochemically purified 153Sm) did not show photo peaks corresponding to radionuclidic contaminants of Eu.A viable electrochemical strategy for the large-scale purification of 153Sm from radionuclidic contaminants of Eu has been successfully developed and demonstrated.",

Accordingly, high performance bioaffinity chromatography (HPBAC) approaches are growing in popularity, however, there is a lack of knowledge and no consensus about the relation between HPBAC measurements, in vivo distribution and blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration behavior. With respect to radiotracers, there is almost no reference data available for plasma protein binding (PPB), permeability (Pm) and the membrane coefficient (KIAM). Thus, this study was aimed at exploring the relevance of measuring PPB, Pm and KIAM for the prediction of BBB penetration.Measurements of %PPB, Pm and KIAM were performed using HPBAC. In total, 113 compounds were tested, 43 with brain uptake, 30 not showing brain uptake and 40 with known interactions with efflux transporters. Additionally, ClogP and HPLC logPowpH\u00a07.4 data were collected.%PPB, KIAM, Pm and ClogP values were in the same range for each of the three groups.

However, as the other experimental data, also the HPLC logPowpH\u00a07.4 showed a broad overlapping of the single values between the groupings.Experimental reference values (logP, Pm, KIAM & PPB) of commonly used PET tracers and drugs showing different BBB penetration behavior are provided. The influence of the logP on brain uptake depends strongly on the selected method. However, using a single parameter (experimental or calculated) to predict BBB penetration or for the classification of drug groups is inexpedient.",

In the future the cyclotron-based methods can replace reactor-based technology in producing this medical radioisotope and the nuclear reaction 100Mo(p,2n)99mTc appears to be the most worthwhile approach. New ways of producing of 99mTc require efficient separation methods. Several strategies for separation of 99mTc from 99Mo have been already developed. The advantages, disadvantages and technical challenges toward application potential of investigated methods to separate 99mTc from irradiated 100Mo target are discussed. These methods include column chromatography, solvent extraction, chemical precipitation and thermochromatography.",

     "abstract": "Our previous work demonstrated that the 99mTc renal tracer, 99mTc(CO)3(FEDA) (99mTc-1), has a rapid clearance comparable in rats to that of 131I-OIH, the radioactive gold standard for the measurement of effective renal plasma flow. The uncharged fluoroethyl pendant group of 99mTc-1 provides a route to the synthesis of a structurally analogous rhenium-tricarbonyl 18F renal imaging agent, Re(CO)3([18F]FEDA) (18F-1). Our goal was to develop an efficient one-step method for the preparation of 18F-1 and to compare its pharmacokinetic properties with those of 131I-OIH in rats.18F-1 was prepared by the nucleophilic 18F-fluorination of its tosyl precursor. The labeled compound was isolated by HPLC and subsequently evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats using 131I-OIH as an internal control and by dynamic PET/CT imaging. Plasma protein binding (PPB) and erythrocyte uptake (RCB) were determined and the urine was analyzed for metabolites.18F-1 was efficiently prepared as a single species with high radiochemical purity (>99%) and it displayed high radiochemical stability in vitro and in vivo. PPB was 87% and RCB was 21%. Biodistribution studies confirmed rapid renal extraction and high specificity for renal excretion, comparable to that of 131I-OIH, with minimal hepatic/gastrointestinal elimination. The activity in the urine, as a percentage of 131I-OIH, was 92% and 95% at 10 and 60\u202fmin, respectively. All other organs (heart, spleen, lungs) showed a negligible tracer uptake (<0.4% ID). Dynamic microPET/CT imaging demonstrated rapid transit of 18F-1 through the kidneys and into the bladder; there was no demonstrable activity in bone verifying the absence of free [18F]fluoride.18F-1 exhibited a high specificity for the kidney, rapid renal excretion comparable to that of 131I-OIH and high in vivo radiochemical stability. Not only is 18F-1 a promising PET renal tracer, but it provides a route to the development of a pair of analogous 18F/99mTc renal imaging agents with almost identical structures and comparable pharmacokinetic properties. These promising in vivo results warrant subsequent evaluation in humans.",

Here we describe the radiolabeling and functional characterization of an imaging probe based on a PDGFR\u03b1-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) for immuno-PET imaging of PDGFR\u03b1 in papillary thyroid cancer.Antibody D13C6 (Cell Signaling) was decorated with chelator NOTA using bioconjugation reaction with 2-(p-NCS-Bz)-NOTA. Radiolabeling was carried out using 40\u202f\u03bcg of antibody-NOTA conjugate with 143\u2013223\u202fMBq of [64Cu]CuCl2 in 0.25\u202fM NaOAc (pH\u202f5.5) at 30\u202f\u00b0C for 1\u202fh. The reaction mixture was purified with size-exclusion chromatography (PD-10 column). PDGFR\u03b1 and mock transfected B-CPAP thyroid cancer cells lines for validation of 64Cu-labeled immuno-conjugates were generated using LVX-Tet-On technology. PET imaging was performed in NSG mice bearing bilaterally-induced PDGFR\u03b1 (+/\u2212) B-CPAP tumors.Bioconjugation of NOTA chelator to monoclonal antibody D13C6 resulted in 2.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.3 chelator molecules per antibody as determined by radiometric titration with 64Cu. [64Cu]Cu-NOTA-D13C6 was isolated in high radiochemical purity (>98%) and good radiochemical yields (19\u201361%). The specific activity was 0.9\u20135.1\u202fMBq/\u03bcg. Cellular uptake studies revealed a specific radiotracer uptake in PDGFR\u03b1 expressing cells compared to control cells.

     "abstract": "For the evaluation of macromolecular drug delivery systems suitable pre-clinical monitoring of potential nanocarrier systems is needed. In this regard, both short-term as well as long-term in vivo tracking is crucial to understand structure-property relationships of polymer carrier systems and their resulting pharmacokinetic profile. Based on former studies revealing favorable in vivo characteristics for 18F-labeled random (ran) copolymers consisting of N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) and lauryl methacrylate (LMA) \u2013 including prolonged plasma half-life as well as enhanced tumor accumulation \u2013 the presented work focuses on their long-term investigation in the living organism.In this respect, four different HPMA-based polymers (homopolymers as well as random copolymers with LMA as hydrophobic segment) were synthesized and subsequent radioactive labeling was accomplished via the longer-lived radioisotope 131I. In vivo results, concentrating on the pharmacokinetics of a high molecular weight HPMA-ran-LMA copolymer, were obtained by means of biodistribution and metabolism studies in the Walker 256 mammary carcinoma model over a time-span of up to three days. Besides, a direct comparison with the 18F-radiolabeled polymer was drawn. To consider physico-chemical differences between the differently labeled polymer (18F or 131I) on the critical micelle concentration (CMC) and the size of the polymeric micelles, those properties were determined using the 19F- or 127I-functionalized polymer. Special emphasis was laid on the time-dependent correlation between blood circulation properties and corresponding tumor accumulation, particularly regarding the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect.Studies revealed, at first, differences in the short time (2\u00a0h) body distribution, despite the very similar properties (molecular structure, CMC and size of the micellar aggregates) of the non-radioactive 19F- and 127I-functionalized polymers. Long-term investigations with the 131I-labeled polymer demonstrated that, despite a polymer clearance from the blood within 72\u00a0h, there was still an increase in tumor uptake observed over time. Regarding the stability of the 131I-label, ex vivo biodistribution experiments, considering the uptake in the thyroid, indicated low metabolism rates.The observed in vivo characteristics strongly underline the EPR effect. The findings illustrate the need to combine information of different labeling approaches and in vivo evaluation techniques to generate an overall pharmacokinetic picture of potential nanocarriers in the pre-clinical setting.The in vivo behavior of the investigated HPMA-ran-LMA copolymer demonstrates great potential in terms of an effective accumulation in the tumor.",

In this study, we tested the binding of radiolabeled mAb 376.96 to human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells and localization in xenografts in immune-deficient mice and evaluated 212Pb-labeled 376.96 (212Pb-376.96) for PDAC therapy.In vitro Scatchard assays assessed the specific binding of 212Pb-376.96 to human PDAC3 adherent differentiated cells and non-adherent cancer initiating cells (CICs) dissociated from tumorspheres. In vitro clonogenic assays were used to measure the proliferation of adherent PDAC3 cells and CIC-enriched tumorspheres treated with 212Pb-376.96 or the irrelevant isotype-matched 212Pb-F3-C25.

     "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) have a wide range of mutations, but can mostly be treated with Imatinib, until eventually resistance towards this tyrosine kinase inhibitor is acquired. Early and non-invasive determination of the sensitivity of the tumor and its metastases towards Imatinib by positron emission tomography (PET) would be beneficial for therapy planning and monitoring.We developed a synthesis strategy towards the precursor molecule, performed the 18F-synthesis and in the following evaluated the radioligand in vitro regarding its lipophilicity, stability and biological activity (KIT binding properties) as well as its in vivo properties in GIST tumor-bearing mice.[18F]fluoronorimatinib could be obtained in an overall radiochemical yield of 22.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3% within 90\u00a0min. The radioligand showed high GIST cell uptake and was able to distinguish between Imatinib-sensitive and resistant tumor cell lines (GIST-T1, GIST882, GIST430) in vitro. Further biological evaluations of the ligand towards 9 different GIST-relevant KIT mutations showed comparable binding affinities compared to the structural lead Norimatinib (65\u00a0nM vs. 53\u00a0nM for wt-KIT). The in vivo evaluation of the newly developed radioligand showed tumor-to-background-ratios comparable to previously described, similar radiotracers.Thus, [18F]fluoronorimatinib is able to distinguish between Imatinib-resistant and sensitive KIT mutations. Although no improvement of in vivo tumor-to-background ratios could be achieved compared to formerly described radioligands, the hepatic uptake could be considerably reduced, being advantageous for the imaging of GIST.Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: We were able to show that it is possible to significantly reduce the unfavorably high hepatic uptake of small-molecule radioligands applicable for GIST PET imaging. This work can thus be the basis for further work intending to develop a PET-radioligand for Imatinib-dependent GIST imaging.",

In this study, the DMSA kit was subjected to forced degradation under hydrolysis conditions as prescribed by the International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guideline Q1A.Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a reverse phase Shim-Pack VP-ODS (150 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm; 5 \u03bcm) analytical column using the gradient elution method. LC-MSn analysis was performed using an Esquire 3000 Plus ion trap mass spectrometer, operating under electrospray ionization (ESI).No products were found under acidic or neutral stress conditions.

The DMSA standard degraded into an adduct DMSA dimer (2DMSA[-2H\u00a0+\u00a0Na]+) and adduct DMSA bound to fumaric acid and dithioglucolic acid (DTGA). In the DMSA kit, the degradation products were dimers and trimers of DMSA with tin.

Hence, time reduction can be of major importance to increase final product yields, MA and activity concentrations. Usually, optimization in this respect only focuses on the radiotracer preparation steps but especially quality control (QC) is rarely even mentioned. Therefore, aim of this work is the establishment of optimized conditions for chromatographic analysis using HPLC within the QC to enable a significant time reduction, which then directly leads to an increase in available amount of radioactive product as well as MA at the time of application.An optimized set-up using ultra-performance liquid chromatography ((U)HPLC) was established and tested on 7 carbon-11 labelled radiotracers used within patient routine or clinical trials.A drastic time reduction was achieved for all tracers.

Non-specific accumulation of [99mTc]duramcyin was studied by \u03bcSPECT imaging in chemotherapy treated COLO205 tumor bearing mice pre-treated with cold duramycin (0.01\u201350 \u03bcg). Cell death targeting ability of the kits displaying the best pharmacokinetic profile was compared in a treatment response study in COLO205 tumor bearing mice treated with conatumumab (anti-DR5 antibody).HPLC purification of kit prepared [99mTc]duramycin and reducing the amount of kit ingredients resulted in the best pharmacokinetic profile with low accumulation in liver, spleen and kidneys. The use of PEGylated [99mTc]duramycin required longer circulation times (> 4 h pi) to obtain good imaging characteristics. Pre-treatment with duramycin significantly decreased tracer uptake in chemotherapy treated tumors in a dose-dependent manner. A blocking dose of 50 \u03bcg significantly increased non-specific accumulation in liver and spleen. Non-specific accumulation of [99mTc]duramycin was however demonstrated to be species dependent. HPLC purified kit A (5.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.71 %ID/cc) and non-purified kit B (1.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.46 %ID/cc) demonstrated a significant increase in tumor uptake compared to baseline following conatumumab treatment.To obtain [99mTc]duramycin with favorable imaging characteristics for cell death imaging in mice [99mTc]duramycin needs to be prepared with high specific activity by applying HPLC purification. The need for HPLC purification appears to be a species dependent phenomenon and might therefore not be required for clinical translation.",

The rapid tumor accumulation and normal tissue clearance of sdAbs might be ideal for use with 211At, a 7.2-h half-life \u03b1-emitter, if appropriate labeling chemistry can be devised to trap 211At in cancer cells after sdAb binding. This study evaluated two reagents, [211At]SAGMB and iso-[211At]SAGMB, for this purpose.[211At]SAGMB and iso-[211At]SAGMB, and their radioiodinated analogues [131I]SGMIB and iso-[131I]SGMIB, were synthesized by halodestannylation and reacted with the anti-HER2 sdAb 5F7. Radiochemical purity, immunoreactivity and binding affinity were determined. Paired-label internalization assays on HER2-expressing BT474M1 breast carcinoma cells directly compared [131I]SGMIB-5F7/[211At]SAGMB-5F7 and iso-[131I]SGMIB-5F7/iso-[211At]SAGMB-5F7 tandems. The biodistribution of the two tandems was evaluated in SCID mice with subcutaneous BT474M1 xenografts.Radiochemical yields for Boc2-iso-[211At]SAGMB and Boc2-[211At]SAGMB synthesis, and efficiencies for coupling of iso-[211At]SAGMB and [211At]SAGMB to 5F7 were similar, with radiochemical purities of [211At]SAGMB-5F7 and iso-[211At]SAGMB-5F7 >\u00a098%. iso-[211At]SAGMB-5F7 and [211At]SAGMB-5F7 had immunoreactive fractions >\u00a080% and HER2 binding affinities of less than 5 nM. Internalization assays demonstrated high intracellular trapping of radioactivity, with little difference observed between corresponding 211At- and 131I-labeled 5F7 conjugates. Higher BT474M1 intracellular retention was observed from 1-6 h for the iso-conjugates (iso-[211At]SAGMB-5F7, 74.3 \u00b1 2.8%, vs. [211At]SAGMB-5F7, 63.7 \u00b1 0.4% at 2 h) with the opposite behavior observed at 24 h. Peak tumor uptake for iso-[211At]SAGMB-5F7 was 23.4 \u00b1 2.2% ID/g at 4 h, slightly lower than its radioiodinated counterpart, but significantly higher than observed with [211At]SAGMB-5F7. Except in kidneys and lungs, tumor-to-normal organ ratios for iso-[211At]SAGMB-5F7 were greater than 10:1 by 2 h, and significantly higher than those for [211At]SAGMB-5F7.These 211At-labeled sdAb conjugates, particularly iso-[211At]SAGMB-5F7, warrant further evaluation for targeted \u03b1-particle radiotherapy of HER2-expressing cancers.",

In order to clarify the utility of [11C]acetate for atherosclerosis imaging, we determined the uptake and metabolism of acetate by in vitro studies using rabbit atherosclerotic arteries and [14C]acetate.Rabbits were fed with a conventional (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or a 0.5% cholesterol diet (n\u00a0=\u00a06). One side of the iliac\u2013femoral arteries was injured by a balloon catheter. Radioactivity levels in the iliac\u2013femoral arteries were measured after incubation in DMEM containing [1-14C]acetate for 60 min (% dpm/mg tissue). Radioactive components in the homogenized arteries were partitioned into aqueous, organic, and residue fractions by the Folch method, and analyzed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC).The radioactivity level in the injured arteries of rabbits fed with the 0.5% cholesterol diet (atherosclerotic arteries) was significantly higher than that in either the non-injured or injured arteries of rabbits fed with the conventional diet (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) (% dpm/mg tissue: conventional diet groups; 0.022\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005 and 0.024\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.007, cholesterol diet groups; 0.029\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.007 and 0.034\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.005 for non-injured and injured arteries). In metabolite analysis, most of the radioactivity was found in the aqueous fraction in each group (87.4\u201394.6% of total radioactivity in the arteries), and glutamate was a dominant component (67.4\u201369.7% of the aqueous fraction in the arteries).The level of [14C]acetate-derived radioactivity into the arteries was increased by balloon injury and the burden of a cholesterol diet. Water-soluble metabolites were the dominant components with radioactivity in the atherosclerotic lesions.

In vitro stability was assessed by measuring extracellular radioactivity during the 0\u2013180 min incubation at 37\u00b0C. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) of the extracellular fluid was performed. The autologous RBCs were intravenously injected in four rats and PET scanning was simultaneously performed for 30 min. Time-activity curves of several organs, including the spleen, were analyzed on the PET images.Labeling efficiency was 92%. Low levels of radioactivity were released from the labeled RBCs for 180 min. TLC revealed that 80% of the released radioactivity was due to [18F]FDG-6-phosphate. Whole body images showed strong uptake of heat-denatured [18F]FDG-labeled RBCs in the spleen soon after injection in all four rats. Time-activity curves revealed that the splenic uptake continued to increase for 30 min and the amount of radioactivity in the other organs, except the urinary bladder, decreased after the initial surge.Heat-denatured [18F]FDG-labeled RBCs are suitable spleen-specific agents for PET. This method is clinically relevant as an alternative for heat-denatured 99mTc-labeled RBC scintigraphy.",

Recently, we synthesized a novel bifunctional chelator (BFC) bearing hydroxamic acid arms (DOTHA2). Here we investigated the potential of a novel DOTHA2-conjugated, 64Cu-radiolabeled GRPR peptide antagonist, [D-Phe6-Sta13-Leu14-NH2]bombesin(6-14) (DOTHA2-PEG-RM26) to visualize prostate tumors by PET imaging.DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 was conveniently and efficiently assembled on solid support. The compound was radiolabeled with 64Cu and its affinity, stability, cellular uptake on PC3 prostate cancer cells were evaluated. The in vitro and in vivo behavior of [64Cu]DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 was examined by PET imaging using human PC3 prostate cancer xenografts and its behavior was compared to that of the analogous [64Cu]NOTA-PEG-RM26.The inhibition constant of natCu-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 was in the low nanomolar range (0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 nM).

[64Cu]-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 demonstrated rapid blood and renal clearance as well as a high tumor uptake. Small animal PET images confirmed high and specific uptake in PC3 tumor. Both [64Cu]-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 and [64Cu]-NOTA-PEG-RM26 displayed similar tumor and normal tissue uptakes at early time point post injection.[64Cu]-DOTHA2-PEG-RM26 allows visualization of prostate tumors by PET imaging.

     "abstract": "Several psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with malfunction of brain norepinephrine transporter (NET). However, current clinical evaluations of NET function are limited by the lack of sufficiently sensitive methods of detection. To this end, we have synthesized exo-3-[(6-[18F]fluoro-2-pyridyl)oxy]-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]-octane ([18F]NS12137) as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) and have demonstrated that it is highly specific for in vivo detection of NET-rich regions of rat brain tissue.We applied two methods of electrophilic, aromatic radiofluorination of the precursor molecule, exo-3-[(6-trimethylstannyl-2-pyridyl)oxy]-8-azabicyclo-[3.2.1]octane-8-carboxylate: (1) direct labeling with [18F]F2, and (2) labeling with [18F]Selectfluor, a derivative of [18F]F2, using post-target produced [18F]F2. The time-dependent distribution of [18F]NS12137 in brain tissue of healthy, adult Sprague\u2013Dawley rats was determined by ex vivo autoradiography. The specificity of [18F]NS12137 binding was demonstrated on the basis of competitive binding by nisoxetine, a known NET antagonist of high specificity.[18F]NS12137 was successfully synthesized with radiochemical yields of 3.9% \u00b1 0.3% when labeled with [18F]F2 and 10.2% \u00b1 2.7% when labeled with [18F]Selectfluor. The molar activity of radiotracer was 8.8 \u00b1 0.7 GBq/\u03bcmol with [18F]F2 labeling and 6.9 \u00b1 0.4 GBq/\u03bcmol with [18F]Selectfluor labeling at the end of synthesis of [18F]NS12137. Uptake of [18F]NS12137 in NET-rich areas in rat brain was demonstrated with the locus coeruleus (LCoe) having the highest regional uptake. Prior treatment of rats with nisoxetine showed no detectable [18F]NS12137 in the LCoe. Analyses of whole brain samples for radiometabolites showed only the parent compound [18F]NS12137. Uptake of 18F-radioactivity in bone increased with time.The two electrophilic 18F-labeling methods proved to be suitable for synthesis of [18F]NS12137 with the [18F]Selectfluor method providing an approximate three-fold higher yield than the [18F]F2 method. As an electrostatically neutral radiotracer [18F]NS12137 crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier and enabled specific labeling of NET-rich regions of rat brain tissue with the highest concentration in the LCoe.",

Furthermore, the oxytocin system appears as a possible therapeutic target in autism spectrum disorders and other psychiatric troubles, justifying current pharmacological researches.

Autoradiography experiments were performed on rat brain tissue to evaluate the in vitro distribution of the [11C]PF-3274167. MicroPET experiments were conducted with and without pre-injection of ciclosporin in order to evaluate the influence of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on the brain uptake.[11C]PF-3274167 was synthesized with high radiochemical and chemical purities (>\u00a095%) and good specific activity. The measured logD was 1.93. In vitro, [11C]PF-3274167 did not show any evidence of specific binding to OTR. PET imaging showed that [11C]PF-3274167 uptake in rat brain was very low in basal conditions but increased significantly after the administration of ciclosporin, suggesting that it is a substrate of the P-gp. In the ciclosporin-pre-injected rat, however, [11C]PF-3274167 distribution did not match with the known distribution of OTR in rats.[11C]PF-3274167 is not a suitable tracer for imaging of OTR in rat brain, probably because of a too low affinity for this receptor in addition to a poor brain penetration.",

     "abstract": "Pretargeted radioimmunoimaging and -therapy approaches building on the bioorthogonal inverse-electron-demand Diels\u2013Alder (IEDDA) reaction between strained trans-cyclooctenes (TCO) and electron-deficient tetrazines (Tz) have yielded impressive results in recent years and have proven a vital alternative to biological pretargeting systems. After improvement of the TCO\u2013antibody conjugates, we here report on our evaluation of a new series of radiolabeled Tz-probes.Four new Tz-probes were synthesized, radiolabeled with lutetium-177, and characterized in vitro in terms of lipophilicity, reactivity, and stability in PBS and mouse serum. The in vivo biodistribution profile and tumor-targeting potential of the probes were evaluated in LS174T tumor-bearing mice pretargeted with TCO\u2013antibody conjugates using non-pretargeted mice as control.Radiolabeling of all probes proceeded in high yields providing the 177Lu-labeled tetrazines in >\u00a095% radiochemical purity without any further purification. In mouse serum, half-lives of the probes varied between 8 and 13 h, with the exception of the most lipophilic probe, [177Lu]1b, with a serum half-life of less than 1 h. This probe also showed the fastest blood clearance (t1/2 = 5.4 min), more than 2-fold faster than PEG-linked probes [177Lu]3 and [177Lu]4, and even 3-fold faster than the other small probes without the PEG-linker, [177Lu]1a and [177Lu]2. In the pretargeting experiments, tumor uptake of the lead probe [177Lu]4 (~\u00a06 %ID/g) was most closely approached by [177Lu]2, followed by [177Lu]3 and [177Lu]1a. While all the smaller and more lipophilic probes suffered from increased liver uptake, the PEG-linked probe [177Lu]3 with its additional negative charge surprisingly showed the highest kidney uptake among all of the probes.The in vitro performance of some of the new tetrazine probes turned out to be comparable to the established lead probe [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-PEG11-Tz ([177Lu]4). However, tumor pretargeting studies in vivo showed lower tumor uptake and increased uptake in non-target organs.",

Towards developing dopaminergic biomarkers of brain involvement in HIV, we assessed the pre and postsynaptic components of the dopaminergic system in the HIV-1 transgenic rat (Tg), a well-characterized model of treated HIV\u00a0+ patients, using small-animal PET imaging.Fifteen to 18 month-old Tg and wild type (WT) rats were imaged with both [18F]-FP-CMT, a dopamine transporter (DAT) ligand (n\u00a0=\u00a016), and [18F]-Fallypride, a D2/D3 dopamine receptor (D2/D3DR) ligand (n\u00a0=\u00a016). Five to 8 month-old Tg and WT rats (n\u00a0=\u00a018) were also imaged with [18F]-FP-CMT. A subset of animals was imaged longitudinally at 7 and 17 months of age. Multiplex immunohistochemistry staining for DAT, tyrosine hydroxylase, D2DR, D3DR, GFAP, Iba1 and NeuN was performed on a subgroup of the scanned animals.[18F]-FP-CMT and [18F]-Fallypride binding potential (BPND) values were significantly lower in 15\u201318 month-old Tg compared to age-matched WT rats (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 and 0.001, respectively). [18F]-FP-CMT BPND values in 5\u20138 month-old rats, however, were not significantly different. Longitudinal age-related decrease in [18F]-FP-CMT BPND was exacerbated in the Tg rat. Immunohistochemistry showed decreased staining of dopaminergic markers in Tg rats. Rats with higher serum gp120 had lower mean BPND values for both ligands.We found presynaptic and postsynaptic dopaminergic dysfunction/loss in older Tg compared to WT rats. We believe this to be related to neurotoxicity of viral proteins present in the Tg rats\u2019 serum and brain.Our findings confirm prior reports of neurobehavioral abnormalities suggestive of dopaminergic dysfunction in this model. They also suggest similarities between the Tg rat and HIV\u00a0+ patients as far as dopaminergic dysfunction.The Tg rat, along with the above-described quantitative PET imaging biomarkers, can have a role in the evaluation of HIV neuroprotective therapies prior to human translation.",

     "abstract": "Recent successes in the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPCa) by systemic endoradiotherapy has sparked renewed interest in developing small molecule ligands targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and chelators capable of stable complexation of metal radionuclides for imaging and therapy. As the size and coordination number of metals for imaging, such as 68Ga3\u00a0+, and for targeted therapy, such as 177Lu3\u00a0+ and 225Ac3\u00a0+, are substantially different, they may show a preference for macrocycles of different denticity. We have prepared three simple conjugates that target PSMA and form radiometal complexes through coordination by either octa-, deca-, or dodecadentate tetraazacyclododecane chelators. The complex formation and metal ion selectivity of these constructs were determined at two relevant temperatures, complex stability was examined in vitro, and tumor targeting was demonstrated in preclinical PCa models with a view towards identifying a candidate with potential value as a theranostic agent for the imaging and therapy of mCRPCa.Three bifunctional chelates with high denticity, including the octadentate chelate DOTA, the decadentate 3p-C-DEPA and a novel dodecadentate analogue of DEPA, were synthesized and conjugated to a glutamate-urea-lysine (EuK) pharmacophore (EuK-DOTA, EuK-107 and EuK-106, respectively) to enable targeting of PSMA. The metal ion selectivity for each construct was determined by incubation at 25 \u00b0C and 95 \u00b0C with the trivalent radiometals 68Ga3\u00a0+, 111In3\u00a0+, 177Lu3\u00a0+ and 225Ac3\u00a0+. PSMA binding affinity was determined by competitive binding using LNCaP cells, while in vivo tumor targeting of the 68Ga-labeled constructs was examined by positron emission tomography (PET) in LNCaP xenograft tumor-bearing mice.PMSA affinities (IC50 values) were 13.3 \u00b1 0.9 nM for EuK-DOTA, 18.0 \u00b1 3.7 nM for EuK-107 and 42.6 \u00b1 6.6 nM for EuK-106. EuK-107 and EuK-DOTA proved to rapidly and near quantitatively complex 68Ga3\u00a0+, 111In3\u00a0+, 177Lu3\u00a0+ and 225Ac3\u00a0+ at 95 \u00b0C, with EuK-107 also rapidly complexing 111In3\u00a0+ and 177Lu3\u00a0+ at 25 \u00b0C. The inability of EuK-106 to chelate 177Lu3\u00a0+ and 225Ac3\u00a0+ suggests that size of the cavity of the macrocylic ring may be more critical than the number of donor groups for the chelation of larger radiometals. In vivo, 68Ga-EuK-107 proved to have similar uptake to 68Ga-DKFZ-PSMA-617, a theranostic ligand currently in clinical evaluation, in a PSMA positive xenograft tumor model.The broad metal ion selectivity, good in vitro affinity for PSMA and good in vivo tumor targeting suggest that EuK-107, with the 3p-C-DEPA chelator, merits further evaluation as a theranostics construct in prostate cancer.",

     "abstract": "We have previously developed a pretargeting approach for affibody-mediated cancer therapy based on PNA\u2013PNA hybridization. In this article we have further developed this approach by optimizing the production of the primary agent, ZHER2:342-SR-HP1, and labeling the secondary agent, HP2, with the therapeutic radionuclide 177Lu. We also studied the biodistribution profile of 177Lu-HP2 in mice, and evaluated pretargeting with 177Lu-HP2 in vitro and in vivo.The biodistribution profile of 177Lu-HP2 was evaluated in NMRI mice and compared to the previously studied 111In-HP2. Pretargeting using 177Lu-HP2 was studied in vitro using the HER2-expressing cell lines BT\u2010474 and SKOV-3, and in vivo in mice bearing SKOV-3 xenografts.Using an optimized production protocol for ZHER2:342-SR-HP1 the ligation time was reduced from 15\u00a0h to 30\u00a0min, and the yield increased from 45% to 70%. 177Lu-labeled HP2 binds specifically in vitro to BT474 and SKOV-3 cells pre-treated with ZHER2:342-SR-HP1. 177Lu-HP2 was shown to have a more rapid blood clearance compared to 111In-HP2 in NMRI mice, and the measured radioactivity in blood was 0.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 and 0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07%ID/g for 177Lu- and 111In-HP2, respectively, at 1\u00a0h p.i. In contrast, no significant difference in kidney uptake was observed (4.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.17 and 3.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58%ID/g for 177Lu- and 111In-HP2, respectively, at 1\u00a0h p.i.). Co-injection with either Gelofusine or lysine significantly reduced the kidney uptake for 177Lu-HP2 (1.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 and 1.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2, respectively, vs. 2.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.87%ID/g in controls at 4\u00a0h p.i.). 177Lu-HP2 accumulated in SKOV-3 xenografts in BALB/C nu/nu mice when administered after injection of ZHER2:342-SR-HP1. Without pre-injection of ZHER2:342-SR-HP1, the uptake of 177Lu-HP2 was about 90-fold lower in tumor (0.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 vs. 20.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.5%ID/g). The tumor-to-kidney radioactivity accumulation ratio was almost 5-fold higher in the group of mice pre-injected with ZHER2:342-SR-HP1. In conclusion, 177Lu-HP2 was shown to be a promising secondary agent for affibody-mediated tumor pretargeting in vivo.",

     "abstract": "111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide scintigraphy is an important method of detecting neuroendocrine tumors. We previously reported that a new derivative of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide, 111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u2212\u00a01-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide, accomplished the reduction of prolonged renal accumulation of radioactivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tumor accumulation of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u2212\u00a01-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide in vitro and in vivo by comparing it with 111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide.The tumor accumulation of this octreotide derivative was determined by measuring its uptake using cultured AR42J cells in vitro and biodistribution studies in vivo. The distribution of the radiotracer and the extent of somatostatin receptor-specific uptake in the tumor were estimated by a counting method using AR42J tumor-bearing mice. The radioactive metabolite species in the tumor and kidney were identified by HPLC analyses at 3 and 24\u00a0h post-injection of the 111In-DTPA-conjugated peptide.In both cases, in vitro and in vivo, the tumor radioactivity levels of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u2212\u00a01-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide were approximately 2\u20134 times higher than those of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide. On in vitro cellular uptake inhibition and radioreceptor assay, 111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u2212\u00a01-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide exhibited a binding affinity to somatostatin receptor highly similar to that of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide. As the additional cellular uptake of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u2212\u00a01-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide was significantly lower at low temperature than at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, it was considered that a cellular uptake pathway is involved in energy-dependent endocytotic processes. In the radiometabolite analysis of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u2212\u00a01-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide, 111In-DTPA-d-Phe-Asp-OH was a major metabolite in the tumor at 24\u00a0h post-injection.111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u2212\u00a01-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide exhibited higher tumor accumulation and persistence of tumor radioactivity than 111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide. We reasoned that this higher tumor accumulation would not be based on the receptor affinity but on a receptor-mediated endocytotic process involved in temperature-dependent cellular uptake. The present study demonstrated the great potential of the pharmaceutical development of a new radiolabeled peptide with high tumor accumulation and low renal radioactivity by the chemical modification of 111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide.",

     "abstract": "Nanoscale perfluorocarbon (PFC) droplets have been used to create imaging agents and drug delivery vehicles. However, development and characterization of new formulations of PFC droplets are hindered because of the lack of simple methods for quantitative and sensitive assessment of whole body tissue distribution and pharmacokinetics of the droplets. To address this issue, a general-purpose method for radiolabeling the inner core of nanoscale perfluorocarbon droplets with a hydrophobic and lipophobic fluorine-18 compound was developed, so that positron emission tomography (PET) and quantitative biodistribution studies can be employed to evaluate PFC nanodroplets in vivo.A robust method to produce [18F]CF3(CF2)7(CH2)3F from a tosylate precursor using [18F]F\u2212 was developed. The product's effectiveness as a general label for different PFCs and its ability to distinguish the in vivo behavior of different PFC droplet formulations was evaluated using two types of PFC nanodroplets: fluorosurfactant-stabilized perfluorohexane (PFH) nanodroplets and lipid-stabilized perfluorooctylbromide (PFOB) nanodroplets. In vivo assessment of the 18F-labeled PFH and PFOB nanodroplets were conducted in normal mice following intravenous injection using small animal PET imaging and gamma counting of tissues and fluids.[18F]CF3(CF2)7(CH2)3F was produced in modest yield and was stable with respect to loss of fluoride in vitro. The labeled fluorocarbon was successfully integrated into PFH nanodroplets (~\u00a0175 nm) and PFOB nanodroplets (~\u00a0260 nm) without altering their mean sizes, size distributions, or surface charges compared to their non-radioactive analogues. No leakage of the radiolabel from the nanodroplets was detected after droplet formation in vitro. PET imaging and biodistribution data for the two droplet types tested showed significantly different tissue uptake and clearance patterns.A convenient method for producing 18F-labeled PFC droplets was developed. The results highlight the potential utility of the strategy for pre-clinical evaluation of different PFC droplet formulations through direct PFC core labeling using a fluorinated radiolabel.",

     "abstract": "The serotonergic system is widely present in all regions of the central nervous system (CNS) and plays a key modulatory role in many of its functions. Positron emission tomography (PET) is used to study several serotonin receptors in CNS in vivo. The G-protein coupled receptor 5-HT1B is mostly present in the occipital cortex and in midbrain and is linked to several psychiatric disorders. There is evidence that agonist PET radioligands for neuroreceptors are more sensitive to endogenous neurotransmitters than antagonists. Our previously developed 5-HT1B receptor PET radioligand, [11C]AZ10419369, is now considered a partial agonist. In this work we are aiming to develop a full antagonist PET radioligand for imaging brain 5-HT1B receptors, and evaluate its sensitivity to increased endogenous serotonin concentration.[11C]AZ10419096 was synthesized by rapid methylation of the prepared corresponding N-desmethyl precursor with [11C]methyl triflate. Five PET measurements were performed in cynomolgus monkeys, consisting of two at baseline, one after treatment of a monkey with a 5-HT1B antagonist, AR-A000002, and two in which fenfluramine was administered during scanning to induce endogenous serotonin release.[11C]AZ10419096 was synthesized in high yield and purity within 30 min, including purification, formulation and sterile filtration. The baseline PET measurements demonstrated [11C]AZ10419096 to have favorable radioligand characteristics, including high specific binding in brain regions that have high 5-HT1B density, such as occipital cortex and globus pallidus, as well as subsequent rapid elimination from brain and a minor abundance of lipophilic radiometabolites in plasma. AR-A00002 completely blocked radioligand receptor-specific binding. Fenfluramine produced a distinct displacement of radioligand consistent with an expected increase of synaptic endogenous serotonin concentration.[11C]AZ10419096, a full 5-HT1B antagonist PET radioligand, demonstrates high specific binding in monkey brain that is sensitive to competition from a known 5-HT1B antagonist as well as to putatively increased endogenous serotonin levels.",

In the first method 131I/211At-Rh[16aneS4]-COOH complexes were obtained that required further coupling to a biomolecule. In the second approach, the bioconjugate [16aneS4]-SP5\u201311 was synthesized and further labeled with 131I and 211At through the utilization of a Rh(III) metal cation bridge. The synthesized compounds were analyzed by HPLC, TLC and paper electrophoresis.The 131I/211At-Rh[16aneS4]-COOH complexes were obtained in high yield and possessed good stability in PBS and CSF. Preliminary studies on coupling of 131I-Rh[16aneS4]-COOH to substance P (5\u201311) in 2-step synthesis showed that this procedure was too long with respect to 211At half-life, prompting us to improve it by finally using a 1-step synthesis. This strategy not only shortened the labeling time, but also increased final yield of 131I/211At-Rh[16aneS4]-SP5\u201311 radiobioconjugates. The stability of both compounds in PBS and CSF was high. Toxicity studies with the 211At-Rh[16aneS4]-SP5\u201311 demonstrated that radiobioconjugate significantly reduced T98G cell viability in a dose dependent manner reaching 20% of survival at the highest radioactivity 1200\u00a0kBq/mL.The radiobioconjugate 211At-Rh[16aneS4]-SP5\u201311 revealed its potential in killing glioma T98G cells during in vitro studies; therefore further animal studies to are required to determine its in vivo stability and treatment potential in normal and xenografted mice.",

     "abstract": "We describe a simple fixture that can be added to the imaging bed of a small-animal PET scanner that allows for automated counting of multiple organ or tissue samples from mouse-sized animals and counting of injection syringes prior to administration of the radiotracer. The combination of imaging and counting capabilities in the same machine offers advantages in certain experimental settings.A polyethylene block of plastic, sculpted to mate with the animal imaging bed of a small-animal PET scanner, is machined to receive twelve 5-ml containers, each capable of holding an entire organ from a mouse-sized animal. In addition, a triangular cross-section slot is machined down the centerline of the block to secure injection syringes from 1-ml to 3-ml in size. The sample holder is scanned in PET whole-body mode to image all samples or in one bed position to image a filled injection syringe. Total radioactivity in each sample or syringe is determined from the reconstructed images of these objects using volume re-projection of the coronal images and a single region-of-interest for each. We tested the accuracy of this method by comparing PET estimates of sample and syringe activity with well counter and dose calibrator estimates of these same activities.PET and well counting of the same samples gave near identical results (in MBq, R2\u00a0=\u00a00.99, slope\u00a0=\u00a00.99, intercept\u00a0=\u00a00.00-MBq). PET syringe and dose calibrator measurements of syringe activity in MBq were also similar (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.99, slope\u00a0=\u00a00.99, intercept\u00a0=\u00a0\u2212 0.22-MBq).A small-animal PET scanner can be easily converted into a multi-sample and syringe counting device by the addition of a sample block constructed for that purpose. This capability, combined with live animal imaging, can improve efficiency and flexibility in certain experimental settings.",

     "abstract": "Few, if any, radiotracers are available for the in vivo imaging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the central nervous system. ROS play a critical role in normal cell processes such as signaling and homeostasis but overproduction of ROS is implicated in several disorders. We describe here the radiosynthesis and initial ex vivo and in vivo evaluation of [11C]hydromethidine ([11C]HM) as a radiotracer to image ROS using positron emission tomography (PET).[11C]HM and its deuterated isotopologue [11C](4) were produced using [11C]methyl triflate in a one-pot, two-step reaction and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. Ex vivo biodistribution studies were performed after tail vein injections of both radiotracers. To demonstrate sensitivity of uptake to ROS, [11C]HM was administered to rats treated systemically with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In addition, ex vivo autoradiography and in vivo PET imaging were performed using [11C]HM on rats which had been microinjected with sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to induce ROS.[11C]HM and [11C](4) radiosyntheses were reliable and produced the radiotracers at high specific activities and radiochemical purities. Both radiotracers demonstrated good brain uptake and fast washout of radioactivity, but [11C](4) washout was faster. Pretreatment with LPS resulted in a significant increase in brain retention of radioactivity. Ex vivo autoradiography and PET imaging of rats unilaterally treated with microinjections of SNP demonstrated increased retention of radioactivity in the treated side of the brain.[11C]HM has the attributes of a radiotracer for PET imaging of ROS in the brain including good brain penetration and increased retention of radioactivity in animal models of oxidative stress.",

Insulinoma xenograft was detected in all the imaged animals. Xenograft was characterized by an early but moderate increase of 18F-FET uptake followed by a slight decline of uptake intensity during the 20 min dynamic acquisition. Tumoral radiotracer peak intensity and the highest tumor-to-background contrast were reached about 5 minutes after 18F-FET iv. injection (mean SUV: 1.21 \u00b1 0.10). The biodistribution of 18F-FET and 18F-FDOPA and their dynamic tumoral uptake profile and intensity were similar. In the examined patient, 18F-FDOPA and 18F-FET PET/CT showed one concordant focal area of well-defined increased uptake in the pancreatic tail corresponding to 11 mm histologically proved insulinoma. The SUVmax tumor to liver ratio was 1.5, 1.1 for 18F-FDOPA, 1.1, 1 for 18F-FET at early (0-5 min post injection) and delayed (5-20 min post injection) PET/CT acquisition, respectively. Despite the relatively low tumoral uptake intensity, insulinoma was clearly identified due to the low background in the pancreas. At the contrary, no 18F-FDOPA or 18F-FET tumoral uptake was revealed on whole-body PET/CT images performed about 30 min after radiotracer administration. Note of worth, the dynamic uptake pattern of 18F-FET and 18F-FDOPA were similar between human insulinoma and mice xenograft tumor.18F-FET PET compared equally to 18F-FDOPA PET in a preclinical RIN-m5F murine model of insulinoma and in one patient with insulinoma-related hypoglycemia. However, in both cases, the tumoral uptake intensity was moderate and the tumor was only visible until 20 min after radiotracer injection. Hence, caution should be taken before asserting the translational relevance of our results in the clinical practices. However, the structural analogies between 18F-FET and 18F-FDOPA as well as the limited pancreatic uptake of 18F-FET in human, encourage evaluating 18F-FET as diagnostic radiotracer for insulinoma detection in further prospective studies involving large cohorts of patients.",

We show that for at least one specific application, positron projection imaging (PPI) and PET yield comparable estimates of absolute total tumor activity and that both of these estimates are highly correlated with direct well-counting of these same tumors. These findings further suggest that in this particular application, PPI is a far more efficient data acquisition and processing methodology than PET.Forty-one athymic mice were implanted with PC3 human prostate cancer cells transfected with prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA (+)) and one additional animal (for a total of 42) with a control blank vector (PSMA (\u2212)). All animals were injected with [18F] DCFPyl, a ligand for PSMA, and imaged for total tumor radioactivity with PET and PPI. The tumors were then removed, assayed by well counting for total radioactivity and the values between these methods intercompared.PET, PPI and well-counter estimates of total tumor radioactivity were highly correlated (R2\u00a0>\u00a00.98) with regression line slopes near unity (0.95\u00a0<\u00a0slope\u00a0\u2264\u00a01.02) and intercepts near zero (\u22120.001\u00a0MBq\u00a0\u2264\u00a0intercept \u22640.004\u00a0MBq).Total mouse xenograft tumor radioactivity can be measured with PET or PPI with an accuracy comparable to well counting if certain experimental and pharmacokinetic conditions are met.

The aims of this study was to estimate the biokinetics and dosimetry of 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA (99mTc-labeled PSMA inhibitor) in eight healthy subjects and evaluate its usefulness as a tumor-imaging agent in eight prostate cancer patients.99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA was obtained from a lyophilized formulation with radiochemical purities >98%, determined by reversed-phase HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. Whole-body images from eight healthy subjects were acquired at 20\u00a0min, and at 2, 6 and 24\u00a0h after 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA administration. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn around the source organs on each time frame. Each ROI was corrected by background, attenuation, scattered radiation and physical decay. The image sequence was used to extrapolate the 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-iPSMA time\u2013activity curves of each organ to adjust the biokinetic model and calculate the total number of disintegrations (N) that occurred in the source regions. N data were the input for the OLINDA/EXM code to calculate internal radiation doses.

Ten days later, tumor-bearing rats evidenced by bioluminescence received 125I-labeled Chi with left hepatic artery access. Pharmacokinetics and excretion (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and biodistribution (n\u00a0=\u00a06/time point) were studied after injection. To examine therapeutic potential, animals (n\u00a0=\u00a08/group) were also treated with Chi labeled with or without 131I. Changes in tumor volume by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging were studied.The rate of tumor induction assessed by bioluminescence imaging was 72% (68/95). Gamma counter and scintigraphy imaging analyses showed accumulation of 125I-labeled Chi dominantly in the liver. A small fraction of 125I-labeled Chi was detected in the stomach (2.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.07%ID) and muscle (1.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.48%ID) at 2 d post-treatment. Blood sample analysis showed the maximum blood concentration of 0.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03%ID/mL, which peaked at 0.60\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45 d.

Treatment of Chi (median, 876\u00a0mm3; IQR, 496\u00a0mm3\u20131413\u00a0mm3) markedly reduced the extent of tumor growth, compared to controls (median, 12,085\u00a0mm3; IQR, 7786\u00a0mm3\u201325,832\u00a0mm3; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs control). 131I Chi (median, 80\u00a0mm3; IQR, 35\u00a0mm3\u2013172\u00a0mm3; P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs control) induced a greater tumor-suppressing effect, compared to Chi alone.In this study, we have characterized a new radioembolization device, 131I Chi, in vivo and provided evidence for its therapeutic potential.Transarterial embolization is a conceivable treatment option for patients with inoperable liver cancer to mitigate the disease progression. Recently, we have developed chitosan-based hydrogel microparticles. In the present study, the hydrogel microparticles were radiolabeled with 131I for treatment of liver cancer. Our results demonstrated that a hepatic arterial injection of 125I-labeled Chi resulted in substantial liver accumulation, which was accompanied by virtually no extrahepatic deposition. The results of the present study also showed that administration of 131I Chi markedly suppressed tumor growth, compared to controls and to animals receiving unlabeled Chi. 131I-labeled chitosan hydrogel microparticles represent a new therapeutic approach for treatment of liver cancer.",

[67Ga]-DFO, which is a mimetic of the corresponding iron complex, is taken up by bacteria in culture, however in vivo it clears too rapidly to allow for imaging of infection. In response, we developed several new DFO derivatives to identify those that accumulate in bacteria, and at sites of infection, and that could potentially have improved pharmacokinetics.A library of DFO derivatives was synthesized by functionalizing the terminal amine group of DFO using three different carbamate-forming reactions. Uptake of [67Ga]-DFO and the 67Ga-labeled derivatives by bacteria and the biodistribution of lead compounds were studied.67Ga-labeled DFO derivatives were prepared and isolated in >90% radiochemical yield and >95% radiochemical purity. The derivatives had significant but slower uptake rates in Staphylococcus aureus than [67Ga]-DFO (6% to 60% of the control rate), with no uptake for the most lipophilic derivatives. Biodistribution studies in mice with a S. aureus infection in one thigh revealed that the ethyl carbamate derivative had an excellent infected-to-non-infected ratio (11:1), but high non-specific localization in the gall bladder, liver and small intestine.The work reported shows that it is possible to functionalize DFO-type siderophores and retain active uptake of the 67Ga-labeled complexes by bacteria. Novel 67Ga-labeled DFO derivatives were specifically taken up by S. aureus and selected derivatives demonstrated in vivo localization at sites of infection.67Ga-labeled DFO derivatives were actively transported by bacteria using the iron-siderophore pathway, suggesting that it is possible to develop siderophore-based radiopharmaceuticals for imaging bacterial infection.",

     "abstract": "Radiolabeled bombesin (BBN)-analogs have been proposed for diagnosis and therapy of gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR)-expressing tumors, such as prostate, breast and lung cancer. Metabolic stability represents a crucial factor for the success of this approach by ensuring sufficient delivery of circulating radioligand to tumor sites. The amide-to-triazole switch on the backbone of DOTA-PEG4-[Nle14]BBN(7\u201314) (1) was reported to improve the in vitro stability of resulting 177Lu-radioligands. On the other hand, in-situ inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) by coinjection of phosphoramidon (PA) was shown to significantly improve the in vivo stability and tumor uptake of biodegradable radiopeptides. We herein compare the impact of the two methods on the bioavailability and localization of 177Lu-DOTA-PEG4-[Nle14]BBN(7\u201314) analogs in GRPR-positive tumors in mice.The 1,4-disubstituted [1\u20133]-triazole was used to replace one (2: Gly11-His12; 3: Ala9-Val10) or two (4: Ala9-Val10 and Gly11-His12) peptide bonds in 1 (reference) and all compounds were labeled with 177Lu. Each of [177Lu]1\u2013[177Lu]4 was injected without (control) or with PA in healthy mice. Blood samples collected 5\u00a0min post-injection (pi) were analyzed by HPLC. Biodistribution of [177Lu]1\u2013[177Lu]4 was conducted in SCID mice bearing human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 xenografts at 4\u00a0h pi. Groups of 4 animals were injected with radioligand, alone (controls), or with coinjection of PA, or of a mixture of PA and excess and [Tyr4]BBN to determine GRPR-specificity of uptake (Block).The in vivo stability of the radioligands was: [177Lu]1 (25% intact), [177Lu]2 (45% intact), [177Lu]3 (30% intact) and [177Lu]4 (40% intact). By PA-coinjection these values notably increased to 90%\u201393%. Moreover, treatment with PA induced an impressive and GRPR-specific uptake of all radioligands in the PC-3 xenografts at 4\u00a0h pi: [177Lu]1: 4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 to 24.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.9%ID/g; [177Lu]2: 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 to 26.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1%ID/g; [177Lu]3: 6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 to 21.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4%ID/g; and [177Lu]4: 4.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 to 13.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8%ID/g.This study has shown that amide-to-triazole substitutions in 177Lu-DOTA-PEG4-[Nle14]BBN(7\u201314) induced minor effects on bioavailability and tumor uptake in mice models, whereas in-situ NEP-inhibition(s) by PA impressively improved in vivo profiles.",

[18F]MK-9470 is a positron emission tomography (PET) ligand that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the cannabinoid type 1 receptor. In order to fully characterize ligand behavior, tracer uptake measured using in vivo microPET was compared with results from ex vivo tissue dissection.Twelve male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were divided into three subgroups and scanned over time periods of 10\u00a0min, 30\u00a0min and 90\u00a0min using PET. Afterwards, a number of the animals' organs were dissected. Uptake of radioactivity was expressed in terms of %ID/ml and %ID/(g tissue). For comparison of in vivo and ex vivo methods, Bland\u2013Altman plots were computed.The highest uptake of [18F]MK-9470 was found in the liver and small intestine; the brain showed less uptake, while low and unspecific binding was observed in tissue of the heart, lung, kidney and bone. In the brain, normalized uptake of [18F]MK-9470 was on average 0.25%ID/ml (range: 0.16 to 0.28%ID/ml). Bland\u2013Altman plots revealed the best agreement between methods for the 90\u00a0min acquisition protocols.High hepatic accumulation and metabolism of [18F]MK-9470 occur with mainly enteral excretion, which may vary considerably over time \u2014 a finding which may be of relevance in metabolite determination in quantitative brain studies. Comparisons between in vivo and ex vivo methods showed that whole-body distribution of [18F]MK-9470 using positron emission tomography is a preferable alternative to ex vivo biodistribution, and requires a significantly smaller number of animals.",

     "abstract": "Alpha-emitting radionuclides have gained considerable attention as payloads for cancer targeting molecules due to their high cytotoxicity. One attractive radionuclide for this purpose is 212Pb, which by itself is a \u03b2-emitter, but acts as an in vivo generator for its short-lived \u03b1-emitting daughters. The standard method of preparing 212Pb-labeled antibodies requires handling and evaporation of strong acids containing high radioactivity levels by the end user. An operationally easier and more rapid process could be useful since the 10.6\u00a0h half-life of 212Pb puts time constraints on the preparation protocol. In this study, an in situ procedure for antibody labeling with 212Pb, using a solution of the generator nuclide 224Ra, is proposed as an alternative protocol for preparing 212Pb-radioimmunoconjugates.Radium-224, the generator radionuclide of 212Pb, was extracted from its parent nuclide, 228Th. Lead-212-labeling of the TCMC-chelator conjugated monoclonal antibody trastuzumab was carried out in a solution containing 224Ra in equilibrium with progeny. Subsequently, the efficiency of separating the 212Pb-radioimmunoconjugate from 224Ra and other unconjugated daughter nuclides in the solution using either centrifugal separation or a PD-10 desalting size exclusion column was evaluated and compared.Radiolabeling with 212Pb in 224Ra-solutions was more than 90% efficient after only 30\u00a0min reaction time at TCMC-trastuzumab concentrations from 0.15\u00a0mg/mL and higher. Separation of 212Pb-labeled trastuzumab from 224Ra using a PD-10 column was clearly superior to centrifugal separation. This method allowed recovery of approximately 75% of the 212Pb-antibody-conjugate in the eluate, and the remaining amount of 224Ra was only 0.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a07).The current work demonstrates a novel method of producing 212Pb-based radioimmunoconjugates from a 224Ra-solution, which may be simpler and less time-consuming for the end user compared with the method established for use in clinical trials of 212Pb-TCMC-trastuzumab.",

In the tumor microenvironment, their increased activity prevents normal immune function, i.e. tumor cell recognition and elimination by cytotoxic T-cells. Consequently, inhibition of the kynurenine pathway may enhance the activity of cancer immunotherapeutics by reversing immune dysfunction. We sought to investigate the properties of radiolabeled 5-[18F]fluorotryptophan with respect to its ability for measuring IDO1 and TDO2 activity by positron emission tomography (PET).L-5-[18F]fluorotryptophan and D-5-[18F]fluorotryptophan were synthesized by Cu(I) catalyzed [18F]fluorodeboronylation of Boc/tBu protected precursors in moderate yields (1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6%) sufficient for pre-clinical studies. The specific activity of the product was 407\u2013740\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol, radiochemical purity >99% and enantiomeric excess 90\u201399%. Enzymatic assay confirmed that L-5-fluorotryptophan is an IDO1 and TDO2 substrate whereas the D-isomer is not. In-vitro cell uptake experiments using CT26 cells with doxycycline-induced overexpression of human-IDO1 and human-TDO2 revealed an elevated cell uptake of L-5-[18F]fluorotryptophan upon induction of IDO1 or TDO2 enzymes compared to baseline; however, the uptake was observed only in the presence of low L-tryptophan levels in media. PET imaging experiments performed using tumor bearing mouse models expressing IDO1 at various levels (CT26, CT26-hIDO1, 17082A, 17095A) showed tumor uptake of the tracer elevated up to 8%ID/g; however, the observed tumor uptake could not be attributed to IDO1 activity in the tumor tissue. The metabolism of L- and D- isomers was markedly different in vivo, the D-isomer was excreted by a combination of hepatobiliary and renal routes, the L-isomer underwent extensive metabolism to [18F]fluoride.The observed in vivo tumor uptake of the tracer could not be attributed to IDO1 or TDO2 enzyme activity in the tumor, presumably due to competition with endogenous tryptophan as well as rapid tracer metabolism.",

Highest repeatability was seen for liver and bone marrow, with repeatability coefficients of 18.6% and 20.4% when using SUVpeak. Systemic treatment with TKIs both increased and decreased normal tissue tracer uptake at early and late time points during treatment.Simultaneous evaluation of liver and bone marrow uptake in longitudinal response studies may be used to assess image quality, where changes in uptake outside repeatability limits should trigger investigators to perform additional quality control on individual PET images.For [18F]-FLT PET images, liver and bone marrow have low intra-patient variability when quantified with SUVpeak, but may be affected by systemic treatment.In [18F]-FLT-PET response monitoring trials, liver and bone marrow uptake may be used for quality control of [18F]-FLT PET images.",

Biodistribution studies showed higher uptake of [11C]7b in forebrain regions compared with cerebellum. Pre-treatment with MK-801 decreased the overall brain uptake significantly, but not in a region-specific manner. 45\u00a0min after injection 78, 90 and 87% of activity in the brain was due to parent compound for [11C]1, [18F]2 and [11C]7b, respectively.

Their extreme stability, low cost of production and high tolerability for chemical coupling make Nanofitins a very interesting alternative to antibodies and their fragments. Here, a hexahistidine tagged model Nanofitin (H4) directed against hen egg white lysozyme was radiolabelled and injected in mice to provide a baseline biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles to support future Nanofitin development programs.A single cysteine residue has been genetically inserted in a model Nanofitin and its regioselective radiolabelling has been performed with 4-[18F]fluorobenzamido-N-ethylamino-maleimide ([18F]FBEM). The synthesis of [18F]FBEM has been completely implemented on a radiosynthesis unit (FastLab) including HPLC purification and formulation. Coupling with the [18F]FBEM has been achieved on a solid support (Ni magnetic beads) allowing rapid purification at room temperature without organic solvent.

Moreover, few information are available on the bio-distribution of this tracer in female patients. Our aim was to discuss some documented 18F\u2013choline PET/CT pitfalls in prostate cancer patients. Our secondary aim was to describe the 18F\u2013choline bio-distribution in the female body.We collected diagnostic pitfalls in three PET centers examining 1000 prostate cancer by 18F\u2013choline PET/CT. All pitfalls were ensured by follow-up, imaging and/or histology. We also performed whole body 18F\u2013choline PET/CT in 5 female patients.169/1000 (16.9%) patients showed pitfalls not owing to prostate cancer. These findings were due to inflammation, benign tumors while, in 1% of examined patients, a concomitant neoplasm was found. In the female body, the breast showed low physiological uptake.The accurate knowledge of 18F\u2013choline PET/CT bio-distribution and diagnostic pitfalls is essential. Correlative imaging and histological exam are often necessary to depict pitfalls. In women, the uptake in the breast is due to the physiological gradient of 18F\u2013choline uptake in the exocrine glands.Our results confirm the possibility of 18F\u2013choline uptake in several diseases other than prostate cancer. However, our experience was acquired on a large population and shows that a conspicuous amount of 18F\u2013choline diagnostic pitfalls are easily recognizable and attributable to inflammation.

Further, stability of 64Cu-TP3805 complex was evaluated in presence of fetal bovine serum and bovine serum albumin by using SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Kits were then used for PET imaging of BC and PC following eIND (101550) and institutional approvals. Specificity of 64Cu-TP3805 for VPAC1 was examined with digital autoradiography (DAR) of prostate tissues obtained after prostatectomy, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissue, and benign and malignant lymph nodes.

     "abstract": "There is an increasing demand for high throughput methods at early stages of preclinical radioligand development, in order to predict pharmacokinetic properties (e.g., biodistribution) and blood brain barrier (BBB) penetration. One of the most important physicochemical properties is the lipophilicity, measured by means of shake-flask (logP) or HPLC methods. Yet, a plethora of experimental methods are described in the literature for the determination of logP values. These varying methods often lead to different results for one identical compound, which complicates any comparison or prediction for subsequent preclinical studies. However, a standardized and internationally applied and accepted database with logP values for a reliable comparison of the lipophilic character of radiotracers is still missing.Lipophilicity measurements were performed with 121 molecules using a high throughput HPLC method and ClogP values were calculated using ChemBioDraw\u00ae. Furthermore, logP measurements for six representative radiotracers were performed with the conventional shake-flask method and the results were statistically compared to the ClogP and HPLC logP results. Different logP thresholds, suggesting optimal BBB penetration according to literature, were selected and put into relation with the acquired HPLC logP and ClogP values of cerebral tracers.The results of the tested compounds ranged from \u22122.1 to 5.4 with the applied HPLC method. The acquired database comprises ClogP values of the whole set of compounds ranging from \u22124.11 to 6.12. LogP data from different methods were not comparable. The correlation of the obtained logP data to thresholds suggesting an optimal brain uptake resulted in a high number of false positive classifications.The logP determination for prediction of BBB penetration is obsolete. The extensive database, including clinical relevant radiotracers, can be used as comparative set of values for preclinical studies, and serves as a basis for further critical discussions concerning the eligibility of logP.",

The goal of this work was to develop an efficient means of production for 89Zr that provides this isotope with high radionuclidic purity and specific activity. We investigated the irradiation of yttrium sputtered niobium coins and compared the yields and separation efficiency to solid yttrium coins. The sputtered coins were irradiated with an incident beam energy of 17.5\u00a0MeV or 17.8\u00a0MeV providing a degraded transmitted energy through an aluminum degrader of 12.5\u00a0MeV or 12.8\u00a0MeV, respectively, with various currents to determine optimal cyclotron conditions for 89Zr production. Dissolution of the solid yttrium coin took 2\u00a0h with 50\u00a0mL of 2\u00a0M HCl and dissolution of the sputtered coin took 15\u201330\u00a0min with 4\u00a0mL of 2\u00a0M HCl.

The specific activity calculated for the solid coin and 3 different sputtered coins using the concentration of Zr found via ICP-MS was 140\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0mCi/\u03bcmol, 300\u00a0\u00b1\u00a030\u00a0mCi/\u03bcmol, 410\u00a0\u00b1\u00a060\u00a0mCi/\u03bcmol and 1719\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0mCi/\u03bcmol, respectively. Labeling yields of the 89Zr produced via sputtered targets for 89Zr- DFO-trastuzumab were >98%. Overall, these results show the irradiation of yttrium sputtered niobium coins is a highly effective means for the production of 89Zr.",

The aim of this clinical investigation was to assess the clinical usefulness of FDG PET/CT for initial tuberculosis staging and to determine the prognostic value of the decrease of 18F\u2013FDG uptake during antibiotic treatment in LNTB patients.We retrospectively reviewed 18 cases of LNTB admitted at a single center from 2004 to 2014. Medical records of patients who underwent two FDG PET/CT (>6 months interval), at initial staging and at the end of therapy were reviewed to determine the impact of FDG PET/CT on initial management of LNTB and response to therapy. Statistical analysis was performed using linear mixed-effects model.Thirteen cases of disseminated LNTB and five cases of localized LNTB were included in the study. Initial FDG PET/CT allowed guided biopsy for initial diagnosis in 5 patients and identified unknown extra-LN TB sites in 9 patients. Visual analysis follow-up of FDG PET/CT showed a complete metabolic response in 9/18 patients (all of whom were cured), a partial response in 7/18 (5 of whom were cured) and no response in 2/18 (all of whom were not cured). The semi-quantitative evaluation of 18F\u2013FDG intensity decrease based on the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), compared to targeted estimated decrease allowed to predict correctly a complete response to treatment in 14/18 cases.FDG PET/CT allows an accurate pre-therapeutic mapping of LNTB and helps for early TB confirmation. The SUVmax follow up is a potential tool for monitoring the treatment response.",

One of the sources of 44gSc is the 44Ti/44gSc generator, which can conveniently provide this radioisotope on a daily basis at a diagnostic facility. Titanium-44 (half-life 60.0 a), in turn, can be obtained via proton irradiation of scandium metal targets. A substantial 44Ti product batch, however, requires high beam currents, long irradiation times and an elaborate chemical procedure for 44Ti isolation and purification. This study describes the production of a combined 175\u00a0MBq (4.7\u00a0mCi) batch yield of 44Ti in week long proton irradiations at the Los Alamos Isotope Production Facility (LANL-IPF) and the Brookhaven Linac Isotope Producer (BNL-BLIP). A two-step ion exchange chromatography based chemical separation method is introduced: first, a coarse separation of 44Ti via anion exchange sorption in concentrated HCl results in a 44Tc/Sc separation factor of 102\u2013103. A second, cation exchange based step in HCl media is then applied for 44Ti fine purification from residual Sc mass. In summary, this method yields a 90\u201397% 44Ti recovery with an overall Ti/Sc separation factor of \u2265106.",

We compared its performance with that of 18F\u2013deoxyglucose (18F\u2013FDG).Cervical LN and lung melanoma metastasis models were established in C57BL/6 mice. Primary tumors were created by injection of melanoma cells into the pinna, and the resulting cervical LN metastases were evaluated. Lung metastases were created by intravenous injection of melanoma cells. The mice underwent 18F\u2013FDG and 18F-5-FPN positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A biodistribution study was conducted after imaging. Histopathologic evaluation of the tumors was also performed.LN metastases with a diameter\u00a0<\u00a01\u00a0cm were more visible on 18F-5-FPN PET imaging than 18F\u2013FDG imaging. Quantitative analysis showed that the uptake of 18F-5-FPN was significantly higher than that of 18F\u2013FDG, with values of 13.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.80% ID/g and 7.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.95% ID/g (n\u00a0=\u00a05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), respectively. LN-to-muscle ratios were 21.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.02 and 4.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.11 (n\u00a0=\u00a05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) for 18F-5-FPN and 18F\u2013FDG, respectively. Biodistribution results were similar, with high uptake of 18F-5-FPN in the LN. 18F-5-FPN imaging manifested the pulmonary lesions clearly, while the 18F\u2013FDG imaging showed no uptake in lesions <2\u00a0mm. The related uptakes of 18F-5-FPN and 18F\u2013FDG were 3.12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.17% ID/g and 1.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15% ID/g, respectively (n\u00a0=\u00a05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), with lung metastasis-to-muscle ratios of 8.16\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.12 and 1.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.18 (n\u00a0=\u00a05, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), respectively. H&E and Prussian blue staining displayed pluri nucleated or mega nucleus cells and dark brown granules in the metastatic tissues, characteristic of melanoma.18F-5-FPN targeted small metastatic lesions with a higher target-to-normal ratio of uptake than those of 18F\u2013FDG, which suggests its ability to detect metastatic lesions earlier than 18F\u2013FDG. Further studies with a wide range of melanoma cell lines should be needed to confirm the similar performance.",

However, 18F-labeled N-substituted l-DOPA analogues have not been reported so far. In the current study, radiosynthesis and biological evaluation of a new 18F-labeled l-DOPA analogue, N-(2-[18F]fluoropropionyl)-3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine ([18F]FPDOPA) for tumor PET imaging are performed.The synthesis of [18F]FPDOPA was via a two-step reaction sequence from 4-nitrophenyl-2-[18F]fluoropropionate ([18F]NFP). The biodistribution of [18F]FPDOPA was determined in normal Kunming mice. In vitro competitive inhibition and protein incorporation experiments were performed with SPC-A-1 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. PET/CT studies of [18F]FPDOPA were conducted in C6 rat glioma and SPC-A-1 human lung adenocarcinoma and H460 human large cell lung cancer-bearing nude mice.[18F]FPDOPA was prepared with a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% and a specific activity of 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol (n\u00a0=\u00a010) within 125\u00a0min. In vitro cell experiments showed that [18F]FPDOPA uptake in SPC-A-1 cells was primarily transported through Na+-independent system L, with Na+-dependent system B0,+ and system ASC partly involved in it. Biodistribution data in mice showed that renal\u2013bladder route was the main excretory system of [18F]FPDOPA. PET imaging demonstrated intense accumulation of [18F]FPDOPA in several tumor xenografts, with (8.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.40)%ID/g in C6 glioma, (6.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12)%ID/g in SPC-A-1 lung adenocarcinoma, and (6.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10)%ID/g in H460 large cell lung cancer, respectively.A novel N-substituted 18F-labeled L-DOPA analogue [18F]FPDOPA is synthesized and evaluated in vitro and in vivo.

No study has been yet reported on preparing a complex of 188Re with pamidronate (3-aminohydroxypropylidene-1,1-bisphosphonic acid) (PMA) as a second generation bisphosphonate. Based on this fact, it was hypothesized that a bone-seeking 188Re-PMA radiopharmaceutical could be developed as an agent for palliative radiotherapy of bone pain due to skeletal metastases.Pamidronate was labeled with 188ReO4\u2212 eluted from the alumina based 188W/188Re generator.

Biodistribution of this radioconjugate was evaluated and verified further in mice.188Re-PMA was prepared successfully in a high labeling yield (\u02c395%) corresponding to a specific activity of 124\u00a0MBq/\u03bcmol and good in vitro stability, but it is likely to consist of multiple species.

The aim of this study was to assess the correlation of accumulation of these two radioactive amino acid analogs with expression of amino acid transporters and cell proliferative activity in carcinoma cells.Amino acid uptake inhibitor studies were performed in four human carcinoma cells (epidermal carcinoma A431, colorectal carcinoma LS180, and lung carcinomas PC14/GL and H441/GL) using the radioisotope analogs [3H]MET and [14C]MeAIB. MeAIB was used to inhibit the A system and 2-amino-2-norbornane-carboxylic acid (BCH) was used to inhibit the L system. The carcinoma gene expression levels of a number of amino acid transporters were measured by microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Carcinoma proliferative activity was assessed using accumulation of [methyl-3H]-3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine ([3H]FLT).[14C]MeAIB uptake occurred principally via a Na+-dependent A type mechanism whereas [3H]MET uptake occurred predominantly via a Na+-independent L type mechanism although other transporters were also utilized depending on cell type. There was no correlation between [3H]MET uptake and total system L amino acid transporter (LAT) expression. In contrast, [14C]MeAIB uptake strongly correlated with total system A amino acid transporter (SNAT) expression and proliferative activity in this preliminary study using four human carcinoma cell lines. Carcinoma proliferative activity also correlated with total SNAT expression.Advances in Knowledge and Implications for Patient Care: Because there is a significant correlation between the accumulation of [14C]MeAIB and the gene expression level of total SNAT as well as the accumulation of [3H]FLT, it is suggested that use of the analog [11C]MeAIB in PET may provide an indication of tumor cell proliferative activity.

The addition of methoxy group on orth- or meta-position of the radiotracers accelerated the radioactivity clearance from liver. The para-radiotracer had the highest uptake in the heart and other non-targeting organs.

Current production methods rely on reactor production by way of the reaction 185Re(n,\u03b3)186gRe, which results in low specific activities limiting its use for cancer therapy. Production via charged particle activation of enriched 186W results in a 186gRe product with a higher specific activity, allowing it to be used more broadly for targeted radiotherapy applications. This targets the unmet clinical need for more efficient radiotherapeutics.A target consisting of highly enriched, pressed 186WO3 was irradiated with protons at the Los Alamos National Laboratory Isotope Production Facility (LANL-IPF) to evaluate 186gRe product yield and quality. LANL-IPF was operated in a dedicated nominal 40 MeV mode. Alkaline dissolution followed by anion exchange chromatography was used to isolate 186gRe from the target material.

     "abstract": "[11C]Flumazenil is a well\u2013known PET tracer for GABAA receptors and is mainly used as an imaging biomarker for neuronal loss. Recently, GABAA receptors on immune cells have been investigated as target for modulation of inflammation. Since neuronal loss is often accompanied by neuroinflammation, PET imaging with [11C]flumazenil is potentially affected by infiltrating immune cells. This may also compromise the validity of using the pons as reference tissue in quantitative pharmacokinetic analysis. This study aims to evaluate whether inflammatory processes in the brain can influence [11C]flumazenil uptake and affect the outcome of pharmacokinetic modeling when the pons is used as reference tissue.The herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) rat model is known to cause neuroinflammation in the brainstem. Dynamic [11C]flumazenil PET scans of 60-min, accompanied by arterial blood sampling and metabolite analysis, were acquired at day 6\u20137\u00a0days post-infection of male Wistar rats (HSE, n\u00a0=\u00a05 and control, n\u00a0=\u00a06). Additionally, the GABAA receptor was saturated by injection of unlabeled flumazenil prior to the tracer injection in 4 rats per group. PET data were analyzed by pharmacokinetic modeling.No statistically significant differences were found in the volume of distribution (VT) or non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) between control and HSE rats in any of the brain regions. Pre-saturation with unlabeled flumazenil resulted in a statistically significant reduction in [11C]flumazenil VT in all brain regions. The BPND obtained from SRTM exhibited a good correlation to DVR \u2013 1 values from the two-tissue compartment model, coupled with some level of underestimation.Reliable quantification of [11C]flumazenil binding in rats can be obtained by pharmacokinetic analysis using the pons as a pseudo-reference tissue even in the presence of strong acute neuroinflammation.",

The main objective of this study was to explore the impact of bifunctional linkers (glutamic acid vs. iminodiacetic acid) on tumor-targeting capability and excretion kinetics of the 99mTc-labeled dimeric cyclic RGD peptides.HYNIC-I2P-RGD2 was prepared by reacting I2P-RGD2 with HYNIC-OSu in the presence of diisopropylethylamine, and was evaluated for its \u03b1v\u03b23 binding affinity against 125I-echistatin bound to U87MG glioma cells. 99mTc-I2P-RGD2 was prepared with high specific activity (~185\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol). The athymic nude mice bearing U87MG glioma xenografts were used to evaluate its biodistribution properties and image quality in comparison with those of 99mTc-3P-RGD2.The IC50 value for HYNIC-I2P-RGD2 was determined to be 39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06\u00a0nM, which was very close to that (IC50\u00a0=\u00a033\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0nM) of HYNIC-3P-RGD2. Replacing glutamic acid with iminodiacetic acid had little impact on \u03b1v\u03b23 binding affinity of cyclic RGD peptides. 99mTc-I2P-RGD2 and 99mTc-3P-RGD2 shared similar tumor uptake values over the 2\u00a0h period, and its \u03b1v\u03b23-specificity was demonstrated by a blocking experiment. The uptake of 99mTc-I2P-RGD2 was significantly lower than 99mTc-3P-RGD2 in the liver and kidneys. The U87MG glioma tumors were visualized by SPECT with excellent contrast using both 99mTc-I2P-RGD2 and 99mTc-3P-RGD2.Iminodiacetic acid is an excellent bifunctional linker for dimerization of cyclic RGD peptides. Bifunctional linkers have significant impact on the excretion kinetics of 99mTc radiotracers. Because of its lower liver uptake and better tumor/liver ratios, 99mTc-I2P-RGD2 may have advantages over 99mTc-3P-RGD2 for diagnosis of tumors in chest region.",

As such, inhibition of ATR can amplify the effects of chemo- and radiation-therapy, and several ATR inhibitors (ATRi) have already undergone clinical testing in cancer. For more accurate patient selection, monitoring and staging, real-time in vivo imaging of ATR could be invaluable; the development of appropriate imaging agents has remained a major challenge.3-amino-N-(4-[18F]phenyl)-6-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)pyrazine-2-carboxamide ([18F]-ATRi), a close analogue of Ve-821, (a clinical ATRi candidate), was readily accomplished similarly to already established synthetic procedures. Structurally, 18F was introduced at the 4-position of the aromatic ring of Ve-821 for generating a labeled ATR inhibitor. In vitro experiments were conducted in U251 MG glioblastoma cell lines and ex vivo biodistribution were performed in subcutaneous U251 MG xenograft bearing athymic nude mice following microPET imaging.[18F]-ATRi has a similar pharmacokinetic profile to that of Ve-821. Using an U251 MG glioblastoma mouse model, we evaluated the in vivo binding efficiency of [18F]-ATRi.

To prevent unnecessary radiation exposure during their clinical application, the present study aimed to develop radiolabeled peptides which could reduce radioactivity levels in the kidney at both early and late post-injection time points by introducing a negative charge with an acidic amino acid such as L-aspartic acid (Asp) at a suitable position in 111In-DTPA-conjugated octreotide derivatives.Biodistribution of the radioactivity was evaluated in normal mice after administration of a novel radiolabeled peptide by a counting method. The radiolabeled species remaining in the kidney were identified by comparing their HPLC data with those obtained by alternative synthesis.The designed and synthesized radiolabeled peptide 111In-DTPA-d-Phe\u22121-Asp0-d-Phe1-octreotide exhibited significantly lower renal radioactivity levels than those of the known 111In-DTPA-d-Phe1-octreotide at 3 and 24\u00a0h post-injection.

Their radiometabolites and intact 111In-DTPA-conjugated octreotide derivative were observed in urine within 24\u00a0h post-injection.The present study provided a new example of an 111In-DTPA-conjugated octreotide derivative having the characteristics of both reduced renal uptake and shortened residence time of radioactivity in the kidney. It is considered that this kinetic control was achieved by introducing a negative charge on the octreotide derivative thereby suppressing the reabsorption in the renal tubules and affording the radiometabolites with appropriate lipophilicity.",

We previously reported that 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET identifies ALI/ARDS prior to radiographic abnormalities. The purpose of this study was to establish the time courses of 18F-FDG uptake, edema and neutrophil recruitment in an endotoxin-induced acute lung injury model and to examine molecular events required for 14C-2DG uptake in activated neutrophils.Lung uptake of 18F-FDG was measured by PET in control male Sprague Dawley rats and at 2, 6 and 24\u00a0h following the intraperitoneal injection of 10\u00a0mg/kg LPS. Lung edema (attenuation) was measured by microCT. Neutrophil influx into the lungs was measured by myeloperoxidase assay. Control and activated human donor neutrophils were compared for uptake of 14C-2DG, transcription and content of hexokinase and GLUT isoforms and for hexokinase (HK) activity.Significant uptake of 18F-FDG occurred by 2\u00a0h following LPS, and progressively increased to 24\u00a0h. Lung uptake of 18F-FDG preceded increased CT attenuation (lung edema). Myeloperoxidase activity in the lungs, supporting neutrophil influx, paralleled 18F-FDG uptake. Activation of isolated human neutrophils resulted in increased uptake of 14C-2DG, expression of GLUT 3 and GLUT 4 and expression and increased HK1 activity.Systemic endotoxin-induced ALI results in very early and progressive uptake of 18F-FDG, parallels neutrophil accumulation and occurs earlier than lung injury edema. Activated neutrophils show increased uptake of 14C-2DG, expression of specific GLUT3, GLUT4 and HK1 protein and HK activity.18F-FDG pulmonary uptake is an early biomarker of neutrophil recruitment in ALI and is associated with specific molecular events that mediate 14C-2DG uptake in activated neutrophils. 18F-FDG PET may provide a potential mechanism for early diagnosis and therapeutic assessment of ALI/ARDS.",

In this study, we sought to determine whether gefitinib could increase the in vivo tumor uptake of human 131I\u2013EGF (131I\u2013hEGF), thereby enhancing the potential of hEGF as a vehicle for EGFR-targeted radionuclide therapy. Western blot analysis was conducted to detect the effects of gefitinib on EGFR expression in human head and neck squamous carcinoma cell line UM-SCC-22B. Nude mice bearing UM-SCC-22B tumor xenografts were pretreated via i.p. injection of gefitinib or DMSO (vehicle control), followed by i.v. injection of 125I\u2013hEGF; the animals were then subjected to ex vivo biodistribution or injection of 131I\u2013hEGF for planar \u03b3-imaging using SPECT, respectively. Targeted radionuclide therapy using 131I\u2013hEGF combined with gefitinib as a vehicle targeting EGFR was also performed in UM-SCC-22B tumor xenografts. The EGFR level was unchangeable in cells pretreated with gefitinib, but after gefitinib pretreatment, the uptake of 125I\u2013hEGF in 22B tumor xenografts increased substantially while the uptake of 125I\u2013hEGF in normal organs was effectively unchanged. 131I\u2013hEGF as a vehicle for EGFR-targeting therapy combined with gefitinib therefore showed strong therapeutic effects against 22B tumor xenografts tolerant to gefitinib. The uptake of hEGF to EGFR-positive tumors was enhanced significantly after gefitinib pretreatment, suggesting that 131I\u2013hEGF is a potential vehicle for EGFR-targeting radionuclide therapy when combined with gefitinib.",

In this study, we evaluated a novel 99mTc-labeled small molecular inhibitor of PSMA.This new small-molecular inhibitor of PSMA, 6-hydrazinonicotinate-Aminocaproic acid-Lysine-Urea-Glutamate (HYNIC-ALUG) was radiolabeled by 99mTc and was evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using PCa models (PC-3 and LNCaP). Radiation dosimetry was assessed in mice.99mTc-HYNIC-ALUG showed excellent stability in different media. A cell assay preliminarily displayed its specificity for PSMA. The inhibitor showed good pharmacokinetics making it suitable for in vivo imaging. PC-3-derived tumors showed no obvious radioactive uptake; however, the LNCaP-derived tumors showed very high radioactive uptake which was significantly decreased by the selective PSMA inhibitor 2-PMPA. Biodistribution in LNCaP xenografts showed an optimum tumor-to-blood ratio of 24.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.54 at 2\u00a0h. Tumor uptake was also decreased in the inhibition experiment with 2-PMPA (19.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.14%ID/g versus 1.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15%ID/g at 2\u00a0h). The effective dose of the 99mTc-HYNIC-ALUG was 8.4E-04\u00a0mSv/MBq.A new 99mTc-labeled PSMA inhibitor with specific accumulation in PSMA-positive tumors and low background in other organs was synthesized. The radiopharmaceutical also showed very low radiation dosimetry. This agent may significantly improve the diagnosis, staging, and subsequent monitoring of therapeutic effects in PCa patients.",

Preparation of 99mTcL-sst2-ANT was achieved via reaction of [99mTc(CO)3(H2O)3]+ with L-sst2-ANT. To test the stability of the radiolabeled complex, challenge experiments were performed in phosphate-buffered saline solutions containing cysteine or histidine and also in mouse serum. Biodistribution and micro-SPECT/CT imaging studies were performed in AR42J tumor-bearing female ICR SCID mice.The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50 value) of ReL-sst2-ANT in AR42J cells was 15\u00a0nM. Preparation of 99mTcL-sst2-ANT was achieved with \u226597% radiochemical yield (RCY) and was verified by HPLC co-elution with the ReL-sst2-ANT analogue. The radiolabeled complex remained intact for up to 24\u00a0h in high concentration solutions of cysteine and histidine at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Furthermore, the radiotracer was 90% stable for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C in mouse serum. Micro-SPECT/CT images showed clear uptake in tumors and were supported by the biodistribution data, in which the 3.2% ID/g tumor uptake at 4\u00a0h was significantly blocked by co-administration of nonradioactive SS-14.A [99mTc(CO)3(N,S,N)]+ chelate was employed for radiolabeling of an SSTR-targeting antagonist peptide. Synthesis of 99mTcL-sst2-ANT was achieved in high RCY, and the resulting complex displayed high in vitro stability.

     "abstract": "Alpha particle emitting isotopes are of considerable interest for radionuclide therapy because of their high cytotoxicity and short path length. Among the many \u03b1 emitters, 223Ra exhibits very attractive nuclear properties for application in radionuclide therapy. The decay of this radioisotope and its daughters is accompanied by the emission of four \u03b1-particles, releasing 27.9\u00a0MeV of cumulative energy. Unfortunately the lack of an appropriate bifunctional ligand for radium has so far been a main obstacle for the application of 223Ra in receptor targeted therapy. In our studies we investigated the use of nanozeolite\u2013Substance P bioconjugates as vehicles for 223Ra radionuclides for targeted \u03b1 therapy.The sodium form of an A-type of nanozeolite (NaA) was synthesized using the template method. Next, the nanozeolite particles were conjugated to the Substance P (5\u201311) peptide fragment, which targets NK-1 receptors on glioma cells. The obtained bioconjugate was characterized by transmission emission spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and dynamic light scattering analysis. The NaA\u2013silane\u2013PEG\u2013SP(5\u201311) bioconjugates were labeled with 223Ra by exchange of the Na+ cation and the stability, receptor affinity and cytotoxicity of the obtained radiobioconjugates were tested.The 223Ra-labeled nanozeolite bioconjugate almost quantitatively retains 223Ra in vitro after 6\u00a0days, while the retention of decay products varies from 90 to 95%. The synthesized 223RaA\u2013silane\u2013PEG\u2013SP(5\u201311) showed high receptor affinity toward NK-1 receptor expressing glioma cells and exhibited a high cytotoxic effect in vitro.Substance P functionalized nanozeolite-A represents a viable solution for the use of the 223Ra in vivo generator as a therapeutic construct for targeting glioma cells.",

Acetazolamide treated rats were intravenously administered with the mixture of 99mTc-HMPAO and N-isopropyl-[125I]iodoamphetamine ([125I]IMP), and arterial blood was then collected for 5\u00a0min. After blood sampling, the brain radioactivity concentration was measured with the auto-well \u03b3 counter.The brain radioactivity concentration after intravenous administration of 99mTc-HMPAO was steady from 14\u00a0s to 60\u00a0min post-injection. A double tracer experiment using 99mTc-HMPAO and [125I]IMP showed that 19\u00a0s was the average of the optimal integration interval of arterial blood 99mTc-radioactivity concentration to obtain CBF values measured by 99mTc-HMPAO identical to those determined by [125I]IMP. The CBF value determined by 99mTc-HMPAO, calculated by dividing the brain radioactivity concentration at 5\u00a0min post-injection by the integrated arterial blood radioactivity concentration until 19\u00a0s post-injection, was well correlated with CBF as determined by [125I]IMP.These results suggest that the CBF quantitation procedure described in this paper could be useful for rat CBF assessment.",

In this work, CB2 is expressed on activated immune cells, which are abundant in inflamed plaques. We evaluated the CB2-specific radiotracer [11C]RS-016 for imaging vascular inflammation in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions.The differential gene expression of microscopically classified human carotid plaques was evaluated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, CB2 expression levels in human plaques were investigated by in vitro autoradiography. As an appropriate animal model we used apolipoprotein E knockout mice (ApoE KO) with shear stress-induced atherosclerosis to evaluate CB2 levels in vivo. Positron emission tomography (PET) was performed with both the CB2 radioligand [11C]RS-016 and the metabolic radiotracer [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) at various time points. Retrospectively, carotids were dissected for histopathology and gene expression analysis.We identified 28 human genes differentially expressed in atherosclerotic plaques compared to normal arteries of which 12 were upregulated preferentially in vulnerable plaques. The latter group included members of matrix metalloproteinase family and the T-lymphocyte activation antigens CD80 and CD86. CB2 was upregulated by 2-fold in human atherosclerotic plaques correlating with CD68 expression levels. Specific in vitro binding of [11C]RS-016 was predominantly observed to plaques. In vivo PET imaging of ApoE KO mice revealed accumulation of [11C]RS-016 and [18F]FDG in atherosclerotic plaques. Development of advanced plaques with elevated CB2 and CD68 levels were found in vitro in ApoE KO mice resembling human vulnerable plaques.We identified human genes associated with plaque vulnerability, which potentially could serve as novel imaging or therapeutic targets. The CB2-specific radiotracer [11C]RS-016 detected human plaques by in vitro autoradiography and accumulated in vivo in plaques of ApoE KO mice, however not exclusively in vulnerable plaques.",

At physiological pH, dianionic 99mTc(CO)3(NTA) has a mononegative inner metal-coordination sphere and a mononegative uncoordinated carboxyl group. To evaluate alternate synthetic approaches, we assessed the importance of an uncoordinated carboxyl group, long considered essential for tubular transport, by evaluating the pharmacokinetics of three analogs with the 99mTc(CO)3(NTA) metal-coordination sphere but with uncharged pendant groups.99mTc(CO)3 complexes with N-(2-acetamido)iminodiacetic acid (ADA), N-(2-hydroxyethyl)iminodiacetic acid (HDA) and N-(fluoroethyl)iminodiacetic acid (FEDA) were prepared using a tricarbonyl kit and isolated by HPLC. The pharmacokinetics were evaluated in Sprague\u2013Dawley rats, with 131I-OIH as an internal control; urine was analyzed for metabolites. Plasma protein binding and erythrocyte uptake were determined from the 10\u00a0min blood samples.

Quality control tests of the radiopharmaceuticals were carried out to assess their suitability for clinical use. The clinical utility of the synthesized radiopharmaceuticals was ascertained by performing PET scans in human patients.During the period of evaluation, 68Ga could be obtained from the generator in 4\u00a0mL of 0.05\u00a0M HCl with 60\u201385% elution yield and >99.99% radionuclidic purity.

     "abstract": "Despite its desirable half-life and low energy Auger electrons that travel further than for other radionuclides, 67Ga has been neglected as a therapeutic radionuclide. Here, 67Ga is compared with Auger electron emitter 111In as a potential therapeutic radionuclide.Plasmid pBR322 studies allowed direct comparison between 67Ga and 111In (1\u00a0MBq) in causing DNA damage, including the effect of chelators (EDTA and DTPA) and the effects of a free radical scavenger (DMSO). The cytotoxicity of internalized (by means of delivery in the form of oxine complexes) and non-internalized 67Ga and 111In was measured in DU145 prostate cancer cells after a one-hour incubation using cell viability (trypan blue) and clonogenic studies. MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 cells were also used.Plasmid DNA damage was caused by 67Ga and was comparable to that caused by 111In; it was reduced in the presence of EDTA, DTPA and DMSO. The A50 values (internalized activity of oxine complexes per cell required to kill 50% of cells) as determined by trypan blue staining was 1.0\u00a0Bq/cell for both 67Ga and 111In; the A50 values determined by clonogenic assay were 0.7\u00a0Bq/cell and 0.3\u00a0Bq/cell for 111In and 67Ga respectively. At the concentrations required to achieve these uptake levels, non-internalized 67Ga and 111In caused no cellular toxicity. Qualitatively similar results were found for MDA-MB-231 and HCC1954 cells.67Ga causes as much damage as 111In to plasmid DNA in solution and shows similar toxicity as 111In at equivalent internalized activity per cell. 67Ga therefore deserves further evaluation for radionuclide therapy.The data presented here is at the basic level of science. If future in vivo and clinical studies are successful, 67Ga could become a useful radionuclide with little healthy tissue toxicity in the arsenal of weapons for treating cancer.",

In the present study two radiolabeled (1\u00a0\u2192\u00a03)-\u03b2-D-glucan aptamers (seq6 and seq30) were evaluated to identity infectious foci caused by fungal or bacterial cells.Aptamer labeling with 99mTc was performed by the direct method and biodistribution studies were accomplished in Swiss mice (n\u00a0=\u00a06) infected in the right thigh muscle with Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans. A 99mTc radiolabeled library consisting of oligonucleotides with random sequences was used as control.There was a higher uptake of 99mTc radiolabeled aptamers in the infected thigh than in the left thigh muscle (non-infected) in the S. aureus infected animals. The target/non-target ratios were 3.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22 for seq6 and 2.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.10 for seq30. These ratios were statistically higher than the value (1.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05) found for the radiolabeled library (control). With regard to biodistribution, no statistical difference was verified between aptamers and control uptakes in the infection foci in the C. albicans infected animals. The target/non-target ratios were 1.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, 1.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 and 1.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 for radiolabeled library, seq6 and seq30, respectively. Scintigraphic imaging of infected foci using radiolabeled aptamers was possible only for S. aureus infected mice.Seq6 and seq30 aptamers proved to be inefficient for diagnosis of C. albicans infection.

     "abstract": "Peripheral artery disease can lead to severe disability and limb loss. Therapeutic strategies focussing on macrovascular repair have shown benefit but have not significantly reduced amputation rates in progressive PAD. Proangiogenic small molecule therapies may substantially improve vascularisation in limb ischemia. The purpose of the current study was to assess the proangiogenic effects of simvastatin in a murine model of hind limb ischemia using longitudinal multimodal imaging.Mice underwent surgical intervention to induce hind limb ischemia, and were treated with simvastatin orally for 28\u00a0days. Neovascularisation was assessed using 99mTc-RGD SPECT imaging, and macrovascular volume was assessed by quantitative time of flight MRI. At each imaging time point, VEGF expression and capillary vessel density were quantified using immunohistochemical analysis.Simvastatin significantly increased 99mTc-RGD retention in the ischemic hind limb by day 3 post-surgery, with maximal retention at day 8. Vascular volume was significantly increased in the ischemic hind limb of simvastatin treated animals, but only by day 22. Immunohistochemical analysis shows that simvastatin significantly augmented tissue VEGF expression from day 8 with increase in capillary density (CD31+) from day 14.Early assessment of proangiogenic therapy efficacy can be identified using 99mTc-RGD SPECT, which displays significant increases in retention before macrovascular volume changes are measureable with MRI.Simvastatin offers an effective proangiogenic therapy as an adjunct for management of limb ischemia. Simvastatin induces integrin expression and vascular remodeling leading to neovascularisation and improved perfusion.",

List-mode imaging was performed over the initial 0\u201310\u00a0min post-injection with the pelvis in the field-of-view. Whole-body images were acquired, pelvis-to-head, at 15, 60, and 90-min post-injection. Additional images of the pelvis were acquired at 40-min and 115-min, and voided urine collected from each subject at 48-min and 120-min post-injection. Radiation dosimetry estimates were calculated from these data using the OLINDA software package.Renal uptake was high and relatively invariant, ranging from 11% to 14% of the injected dose between 15 and 90-min post-injection. Radioactivity collected in the voided urine accounted for 14% of the injected dose over a period of 120-min. Lymph nodes and skeletal metastases suspicious for prostate cancer recurrence were detected in a greater number of patients using 68Ga PSMA-11 than using 11C-acetate.Kidneys are the critical organ following 68Ga PSMA-11 administration, receiving an estimated dose of 0.413\u00a0mGy/MBq.This study confirms that the kidneys will be the critical organ following intravenous administration of 68Ga PSMA-11, and provided data consistent with the expectation that 68Ga PSMA-11 will be superior to [11C]acetate for defining sites of recurrence in prostate cancer patients presenting with biochemical relapse.",

Intraarticular administration (IAR) could be considered as an alternative route for therapy in degenerative and traumatic joint lesions. Our work is outlined as a comparative study of biodistribution of 99mTc-ahMSCs after IV and IAR administration, via scintigraphic study in an animal model.Isolated primary culture of adult human mesenchymal stem cells was labeled with 99mTc-HMPAO for scintigraphic study of in vivo distribution after intravenous and intra-articular (knee) administration in rabbits.IV administration of radiolabeled ahMSCs showed the bulk of radioactivity in the lung parenchyma while IAR images showed activity mainly in the injected cavity and complete absence of uptake in pulmonary bed.Our study shows that IAR administration overcomes the limitations of IV injection, in particular, those related to cells destruction in the lung parenchyma. After IAR administration, cells remain within the joint cavity, as expected given its size and adhesion properties.Intra-articular administration of adult human mesenchymal stem cells could be a suitable route for therapeutic effect in joint lesions.Local administration of adult human mesenchymal stem cells could improve their therapeutic effects, minimizing side effects in patients.",

In previous papers in this series, we have shown that radiation dose has a profound effect on the astatine species that are present in the labeling reaction and their suitability for the synthesis of N-succinimidyl 3-[211At]astatobenzoate. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of adding N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) to the methanol solution used for initial isolation of 211At after distillation, a process referred to as 211At stabilization, on 211At chemistry after exposure to high radiation doses.High performance liquid chromatography was used to evaluate the distribution of 211At species present in methanol in the 500\u201365,000\u00a0Gy radiation dose range and the synthesis of SAB from N-succinimidyl 3-(tri-n-butylstannyl)benzoate in the 500\u2013120,000\u00a0Gy radiation dose range using different 211At timeactivity combinations under conditions with/without 211At stabilization.In the absence of NCS stabilization, a reduced form of astatine, At(2), increased with increasing radiation dose, accounting for about half the total activity by about 15,000\u00a0Gy, while with stabilization, At(2) accounted for <10% of 211At activity even at doses >60,000\u00a0Gy. SAB yields without stabilization rapidly declined with increasing dose, falling to ~20% at about 5000\u00a0Gy while with stabilization, yields >80% were obtained with 211At solutions stored for more than 23\u00a0h and receiving radiation doses >100,000\u00a0Gy.Adding NCS to the methanol solution used for initial isolation of 211At is a promising strategy for countering the deleterious effects of radiolysis on 211At chemistry.This strategy could facilitate the ability to perform 211At labeling at sites remote from its production and at the high activity levels required for clinical applications.",

While significant progress has been made in PET imaging of A\u03b2 aggregates both in vitro and in vivo, options for imaging tau protein aggregates selectively are still limited. Based on the work previously published by researchers from the Tohoku University, Japan, that resulted in the development of [18F]THK-5351, we have undertaken an effort to develop a carbon-11 version of the identical structure - [11C]THK-5351. In parallel, THK-5351 was also labeled with tritium ([3H]THK-5351) for use in in vitro autoradiography (ARG).The carbon-11 labeling was performed starting with di-protected enantiomeric pure precursor - tert-butyl 5-(6-((2S)-3-fluoro-2-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yloxy)propoxy)quinolin-2-yl)pyridin-2-yl carbamate, which was reacted with [11C]MeI, using DMF as the solvent and NaH as base, followed by deprotection with trifluoroacetic acid/water mixture, resulting in enantiomerically pure carbon-11 radioligand, [11C]THK-5351 - (S)-1-fluoro-3-(2-(6-([11C]methylamino)pyridin-3-yl)quinolin-6-yloxy)propan-2-ol.

It has been reported that PET probe with ultra-high SA can detect small change caused by endogenous or exogenous ligand. Recently, Kealey et al. developed [11C]BU99008, a more potent PET probe for I2-imidazoline receptors (I2Rs) imaging, with a conventional SA (mean 76\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol) showed higher specific binding in the brain. Here, to detect small change of specific binding for I2Rs caused by endogenous or exogenous ligand in an extremely small region, such as hypothalamus in the brain, we synthesized and evaluated [11C]BU99008 with ultra-high SA as a useful PET probe for small-animal PET imaging of I2Rs.[11C]BU99008 was prepared by [11C]methylation of N-desmethyl precursor with [11C]methyl iodide. Biodistribution, metabolite analysis, and brain PET studies were conducted in rats.[11C]BU99008 with ultra-high SA in the range of 5400\u201316,600\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol were successfully synthesized (n\u00a0=\u00a07), and had appropriate radioactivity for in vivo study. In the biodistribution study, the mean radioactivity levels in all investigated tissues except for the kidney did not show significant difference between [11C]BU99008 with ultra-high SA and that with conventional SA. In the metabolite analysis, the percentage of unchanged [11C]BU99008 at 30\u00a0min after the injection of probes with ultra-high and conventional SA was similar in rat brain and plasma. In the PET study of rats' brain, radioactivity level (AUC30\u201360 min) in the hypothalamus of rats injected with [11C]BU99008 with ultra-high SA (64 [SUV \u2219 min]) was significantly higher than that observed for that with conventional SA (50 [SUV \u2219 min]). The specific binding of [11C]BU99008 with ultra-high SA (86% of total binding) for I2R was higher than that of conventional SA (76% of total binding).A PET study using [11C]BU99008 with ultra-high SA would thus contribute to the detection of small changes in or small regions with I2R expression and hence may be useful in elucidating new functions of I2R.",

Here, we show that low oxygen tension stimulates human umbilical vein endothelial cell 18F\u2013fluorodeoxyglucose (18F\u2013FDG) uptake and lactate production. This was accompanied by augmented hexokinase activity and membrane Glut-1, and increased accumulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1). Restoration of oxygen reversed the metabolic effect, but this was blocked by HIF1\u03b1 stabilization. Hypoxia-stimulated 18F\u2013FDG uptake was completely abrogated by silencing of HIF1\u03b1 expression or by a specific inhibitor. There was a rapid and marked increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by hypoxia, and ROS scavenging or NADPH oxidase inhibition completely abolished hypoxia-stimulated HIF1\u03b1 and 18F\u2013FDG accumulation, placing ROS production upstream of HIF1\u03b1 signaling. Hypoxia-stimulated HIF1\u03b1 and 18F\u2013FDG accumulation was blocked by the protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, staurosporine. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, wortmannin, blocked hypoxia-stimulated 18F\u2013FDG uptake and attenuated hypoxia-responsive element binding of HIF1\u03b1 without influencing its accumulation. Thus, ROS-driven HIF1\u03b1 accumulation, along with PKC and PI3K signaling, play a key role in triggering accelerated glycolysis in endothelial cells under hypoxia, thereby contributing to 18F\u2013FDG transport.",

This may help to identify breast cancer patients benefiting from HER2-targeting therapies. The best discrimination was at 4\u00a0h post injection. Due to longer half-life, a positron-emitting radionuclide 44Sc (T\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a04.04\u00a0h) might be a preferable label for Affibody molecules for imaging at several hours after injection.A synthetic second-generation anti-HER2 Affibody molecule ZHER2:2891 was labeled with 44Sc via a DOTA-chelator conjugated to the N-terminal amino group. Binding specificity, affinity and cellular processing 44Sc-DOTA-ZHER2:2891 and 68Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:2891 were compared in vitro using HER2-expressing cells. Biodistribution and imaging properties of 44Sc-DOTA-ZHER2:2891 and 68Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:2891 were evaluated in Balb/c nude mice bearing HER2-expression xenografts.The labeling yield of 98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% and specific activity of 7.8\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol were obtained. The conjugate demonstrated specific binding to HER2-expressing SKOV3.ip cells in vitro and to SKOV3.ip xenografts in nude mice.

The aim of the present study was to assess if N-terminal modulations of the statine-based GRPr-antagonist influence the binding affinity, the pharmacokinetic performance and the in vivo metabolic stability.The GRPr-antagonist (D-Phe-Gln-Trp-Ala-Val-Gly-His-Sta-Leu-NH2) was functionalized with the chelator 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) via the spacer 4-amino-1-carboxymethyl-piperidine (Pip) and the amino acid N-Methyl-\u03b2-Ala, to obtain NMe-RM2 and labeled with 68Ga and 177Lu. The GRPr affinity of the corresponding metalloconjugates determined using [125I\u2013Tyr4]-BN as radioligand. In vitro evaluation included internalization studies using PC3 cells. The 68Ga-conjugate was evaluated in PC3 xenografts by biodistribution and PET studies, while investigations on the metabolic stability and plasma protein binding were performed.The half maximum inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of the metalloconjugates, using [125I\u2013Tyr4]-BN, are in the low nanomolar range. PC3-cell culture binding studies of both metallated NMe-RM2 and RM2 show high GRPr-bound activity and low internalization.

In PET studies with SB, a statistically significant increase of [18F]FMZ BPND was found only in the striatum, due to the greater inter-individual variance compared to those with B/I.Data demonstrated that an [18F]FMZ PET study with B/I (Kbol\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0min) is both reliable and sensitive for the assessment of altered GABAA receptor function induced by tiagabine treatment in the rat brain. These results may help to improve the efficiency of the development of new GABA-targeting drugs in the preclinical stage using [18F]FMZ PET.",

     "abstract": "Two different strategies for the nucleophilic radiosynthesis of [18F]F-DOPA were evaluated regarding their applicability for an automated routine production on an Ecker&Ziegler Modular-Lab Standard module.Initially, we evaluated a promising 5-step synthesis based on a chiral, cinchonidine-derived phase-transfer catalyst (cPTC) being described to give the product in high radiochemical yields (RCY), high specific activities (AS) and high enantiomeric excesses (ee). However, the radiosynthesis of [18F]F-DOPA based on this strategy showed to be highly complex, giving the intermediate products as well as the final product in insufficient yields for automatization. Furthermore, the automatization proved to be problematic due to incomplete radiochemical conversions and the formation of precipitates during the enantioselective reaction step. Furthermore, the required use of HI at 180\u00a0\u00b0C during the last reaction step led to partial decomposition of lines and seals of the module which further counteracts an automatization.Further on, we evaluated a 3-step synthesis using the commercially available, enantiomerically pure precursor AB1336 for automatization. This synthesis approach gave much better results and [18F]F-DOPA could be produced fully automated within 114\u00a0min in RCYs of 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01%, ee of >96%, a radiochemical purity (RCP) of >98% and specific activities of up to 2.2\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol.",

     "abstract": "Anandamide (N-arachidonoylethanolamine) is a retrograde neuromodulator that activates cannabinoid receptors. The concentration of anandamide in the brain is controlled by fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which has been the focus of recent drug discovery efforts. Previous studies in C57BL/6 mice using [3H-arachidonoyl]anandamide demonstrated deposition of tritium in thalamus and cortical areas that was blocked by treatment with an FAAH inhibitor and that was not seen in FAAH-knockout mice. This suggested that long chain fatty acid amides radiolabeled in the fatty acid moiety might be useful as ex vivo and in vivo radiotracers for FAAH, since labeled fatty acid released by hydrolysis would be rapidly incorporated into phospholipids with long metabolic turnover periods.Radiotracers were administered intravenously to conscious Swiss\u2013Webster mice, and radioactivity concentrations in brain areas was quantified and radiolabeled metabolites determined by radiochromatography.[14C]Arachidonic acid, [14C-arachidonoyl]anandamide and [14C-ethanolamine]anandamide, and also [14C]myristic acid, [14C-myristoyl]myristoylethanolamine and [14C-ethanolamine]myristoyl-ethanolamine all had very similar distribution patterns, with whole brain radioactivity concentrations of 2\u20134% injected dose per gram. Pretreatment with the potent selective FAAH inhibitor URB597 did not significantly alter distribution patterns although radiochromatography demonstrated that the rate of incorporation of label from [14C]anandamide into phospholipids was decreased. Pretreatment with the muscarinic agonist arecoline which increases cerebral perfusion increased brain uptake of radiolabel from [14C]arachidonic acid and [14C-ethanolamine]anandamide, and (in dual isotope studies) from the unrelated tracer [125I]RTI-55.Together with our previously published study with [18F-palmitoyl]16-fluoro-palmitoylethanolamine, the data show that the primary determinant of brain uptake for these tracers in Swiss\u2013Webster mice is initial distribution according to blood flow. It is possible that recently reported strain differences in long chain fatty acid trafficking between C57BL/6 and Swiss\u2013Webster mice are responsible for the differences between our results using [14C]anandamide and the earlier studies using [3H]anandamide.",

Findings are compared to those previously observed for [125I]-(E)-1-(2-(2,3-dimethoxy-5-yl)ethyl)-4-(iodoallyl)piperazine ([125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE).Syntheses of E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE and [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE were accomplished by standard methods. In vitro receptor binding studies and autoradiography were performed, and binding potential was predicted. Measurements of lipophilicity and protein binding were obtained. In vivo studies were conducted in mice to evaluate radioligand stability, as well as specific binding to \u03c31 sites in brain, brain regions and peripheral organs in the presence and absence of potential blockers.E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE exhibited high affinity and selectivity for \u03c31 receptors (Ki = 0.43 \u00b1 0.03 nM, \u03c32/\u03c31 = 173). [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE was prepared in good yield and purity, with high specific activity. Radioligand binding provided dissociation (koff) and association (kon) rate constants, along with a measured Kd of 0.24 \u00b1 0.01 nM and Bmax of 472 \u00b1 13 fmol/mg protein. The radioligand proved suitable for quantitative autoradiography in vitro using brain sections. Moderate lipophilicity, Log D7.4 2.69 \u00b1 0.28, was determined, and protein binding was 71 \u00b1 0.3%. In vivo, high initial whole brain uptake, >6% injected dose/g, cleared slowly over 24 h. Specific binding represented 75% to 93% of total binding from 15 min to 24 h. Findings were confirmed and extended by regional brain biodistribution. Radiometabolites were not observed in brain (1%).Substitution of dihydrobenzofuranylethyl for dimethoxyphenethyl increased radioligand affinity for \u03c31 receptors by 16-fold. While high specific binding to \u03c31 receptors was observed for both radioligands in vivo, [125I]-E-IA-BF-PE-PIPZE displayed much slower clearance kinetics than [125I]-E-IA-DM-PE-PIPZE. Thus, minor structural modifications of \u03c31 receptor radioligands lead to major differences in binding properties in vitro and in vivo.",

Peripheral and cerebral distributions were determined by ex vivo experiments and by PET imaging in mouse.

[18F]9 presented a typical hepatobiliary and renal elimination, and was rapidly metabolized. The in vivo and in vitro radiometabolic profiles of [18F]9 were similar. Piperidine 12 was identified as the major metabolic fragment of the non-radioactive ligand 9. JDTic 7 was found to be much more stable than 9.Although the newly proposed radioligand [18F]9 was concluded to be not suitable for KOR PET imaging due to the formation of brain penetrating radiometabolites, our findings highlight the metabolic stability of JDTic and may help in the design of novel JDTic derivatives for in vivo applications.",

We therefore designed a method to biologically characterize TPGS-based nanomicelles by labeling them with 99mTc.Labeling process was performed by a direct method. The average hydrodynamic diameter of TPGS nanomicelles was measured by dynamic light scattering and radiochemical purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography.

     "abstract": "G ood m anufacturing p ractice (GMP)-compliant production of radiopharmaceuticals for parenteral application requires great efforts in maintenance of clean room infrastructure and equipment in order to reliably guarantee the constant hygienic quality of the product ( sterility) . Terminal sterilization of the product is not always possible due to short half-life or due to thermal instability of the compound. The typical method for sterilization in these cases is sterile filtration prior to dispensing (distribution of product solution from bulk to patient vials). Therefore, aseptic processing techniques have to be in place in order to ensure sterility. Still, there remains some risk of microbial contamination of the product, and hence a risk for the patient to suffer from infection. Due to the short half-life of the labeling radionuclides, this aspect is aggravated by only retrospectively possible testing for sterility. This work investigated the potential of [18F]-radiation to intrinsically inactivate microorganisms (MO) that might have slipped through the aseptic process.Defined numbers of viable cells of different bacterial strains and molds were incubated with defined amounts of [18F]-activity. After decay of radiation the number of surviving viable cells was determined, D10-values were calculated and evaluated.The MOs tested exhibit a broad range of [18F]-radiation susceptibility, D10-values range from a sensitive 114\u00a0MBq/mL (46\u00a0Gy) to a durable 2,048\u00a0MBq/mL (790\u00a0Gy).The intrinsic [18F]-radiation in radiopharmaceuticals is no safe measure to generally ensure sterility of the product solution in terms of \u201cautosterilization\u201d, because of dependence on various parameters.This work presents for the first time experimental data on the influence of [18F]-radiation on MOs. The results suggest, that aseptic processing techniques are essential and that results of determination of sterility in radiopharmaceuticals should be considered with care (emphasis on importance of media fill campaigns).",

Substantial displacement effect was observed only with unlabeled FP-(+)-DTBZ in the 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ studies. Radiometabolite fraction was higher in the renal cortex than the spleen. Approaches (1) and (3) with spleen to estimate VND provided lowest inter-subject variability of BPND.VT differences among organs and between enantiomers indicated that scaling of reference region values is needed for quantification of VMAT2 binding in the pancreas with 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ. Since the kidney PET signal has greater partial volume averaging and more radiometabolites, the spleen was considered a more practical candidate for use as a scaled-reference region in the quantification of 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ in the pancreas.",

     "abstract": "PARP inhibitors (PARPi) have the potential to impact cancer therapy in a selective patient population; however, despite current patient selection methods clinical trials have shown mixed response rates. It is therefore clinically useful to determine which patients will respond prior to receiving PARPi therapy. One essential biomarker is to measure the level of PARP enzyme expression in tumors. Small molecule radiotracers have been developed to accurately quantify PARP-1 expression in vitro and in vivo. [125I]KX-02-019 is the first report of a radioiodinated analogue of the benzimidazole class of PARPi. Herein, we studied the pharmacological properties of [125I]KX-02-019 as well as the in vivo biodistribution.[125I]KX-02-019 was evaluated in both cancer and non-cancer cell lines. We evaluated the pharmacologic properties of [125I]KX-02-019 in live cells by measuring enzyme association and dissociation kinetics, saturation, and specificity. In addition, competitive inhibition experiments were carried out with commercially available PARPi. Protein expression was analyzed by Western blot to compare PARP-1 and PARP-2 expression across cell lines studied. The biodistribution was studied in a mouse EMT6 tumor model at time points of 0.5, 1, 2, 4 and 6\u00a0h.[125I]KX-02-019 showed subtle differences in pharmacological properties in the absence of PARP-2. In addition, [125I]KX-02-019 was competitively displaced by clinical PARPi. In vivo biodistribution studies showed an increasing tumor to muscle ratio over 6\u00a0h as well as fast clearance from healthy tissues.[125I]KX-02-019 has binding sites in both PARP1 KO cells as well as PARP2 KO cells showing higher affinity for PARP-2. This observation is supported by a decrease in binding affinity in PARP2 KO cells compared to PARP1 KO cells. The pharmacologic and biological properties of [125I]KX-02-019 studied in vitro and in vivo showed that this analogue may be useful in determining pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of clinical PARPi.",

To enhance image contrast in comparison to [18F]FAZA our objective was to 18F-radiolabel an azomycin-2\u00b4-deoxyriboside with \u03b2-configuration ([18F]FAZDR, [18F]-\u03b2-8) to mimic nucleosides more closely and comparatively evaluate it versus [18F]FAZA.Precursor and cold standards for [18F]FAZDR were synthesized from methyl 2-deoxy-d-ribofuranosides \u03b1- and \u03b2-1 in 6 steps yielding precursors \u03b1- and \u03b2-5. \u03b2-5 was radiolabeled in a GE TRACERlab FXF-N synthesizer in DMSO and deprotected with NH4OH to give [18F]FAZDR ([18F]-\u03b2-8). [18F]FAZA or [18F]FAZDR was injected in BALB/c mice bearing CT26 colon carcinoma xenografts, PET scans (10\u00a0min) were performed after 1, 2 and 3\u00a0h post injection (p.i.). On a subset of mice injected with [18F]FAZDR, we analyzed biodistribution.[18F]FAZDR was obtained in non-corrected yields of 10.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4% (9.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0GBq, n\u00a0=\u00a04) 60\u00a0min EOB, with radiochemical purity >98% and specific activity >50\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol.

Moreover, [18F]FAZDR showed an inverse correlation between tracer uptake in carcinomas and oxygen breathing, while muscle tissue uptake was not affected by switching from air to oxygen.First PET imaging results with [18F]FAZDR showed advantages over [18F]FAZA regarding higher tumor contrast at earlier time points p.i. Availability of precursor and cold fluoro standard together with high output radiosynthesis will allow for a more detailed quantitative evaluation of [18F]FAZDR, especially with regard to mechanistic studies whether active transport processes are involved, compared to passive diffusion as observed for [18F]FAZA.",

We have developed copper-64 labeled liposomal formulation that selectively targets bone marrow and therefore serves as an efficient PET probe for imaging bone marrow.Optimized liposomal formulations were prepared with succinyl PE, DSPC, cholesterol, and mPEG-DSPE (69:39:1:10:0.1) with diameters of 90 and 140\u00a0nm, and were doped with DOTA-Bn-DSPE for stable 64Cu incorporation into liposomes.PET imaging and biodistribution studies with 64Cu-labeled liposomes indicate that accumulation in bone marrow was as high as 15.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.69%ID/g for 90\u00a0nm liposomes and 7.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92%ID/g for 140\u00a0nm liposomes at 24\u00a0h post-administration.

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma overall survival has plateaued around 70%, without meaningful improvements in over 30\u00a0years. Outcomes for patients with overt metastatic disease at presentation or who relapse are dismal. In this study we investigated a novel osteosarcoma therapy utilizing radioimmunotherapy (RIT) targeted to IGF2R, which is widely expressed in OS.Binding efficiency of the Rhenium-188(188Re)-labeled IGF2R-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) to IGF2R on OS17 OS cells was assessed with Scatchard plot analysis. Biodistribution studies were performed in heterotopic murine osteosarcoma xenografts. Tumor growth was compared over a 24-day period post-treatment between mice randomized to receive 188Re-labeled IGF2R-specific murine mAb MEM-238 (188Re-MEM-238) or one of three controls: 188Re-labeled isotype control mAb, unlabeled MEM-238, or no treatment.Results demonstrate that the radioimmunoconjugate had a high binding constant to IGF2R. Both 188Re-MEM-238 and the isotype control had similar initial distribution in normal tissue. After 48\u00a0h 188Re-MEM-238 exhibited a 1.8 fold selective uptake within tumor compared to the isotype control (p\u00a0=\u00a00.057). Over 24\u00a0days, the tumor growth ratio was suppressed in animals treated with RIT compared to unlabeled and untreated controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) as demonstrated by a 38% reduction of IGF2R expressing osteosarcoma cells in the RIT group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).In conclusion, given the lack of new effective therapies in osteosarcoma, additional investigation into this target is warranted.High expression of IGF2R on osteosarcoma tumors, paired with the specificity and in vivo anti-cancer activity of 188Re-labeled IGF2R-specific mAb suggests that IGF2R may represent a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of osteosarcoma.This targeted approach offers the benefits of being independent of a specific pathway, a resistance mechanism, and/or an inherent biologic tumor trait and therefore is relevant to all OS tumors that express IGF2R.",

Trastuzumab-AuNP-111In was more efficiently internalized than AuNP-111In and localized to a peri-nuclear region. The SF fraction of SK-BR-3 cells was reduced by 1.8-fold by treatment with 3\u00a0nM (7\u00a0MBq/mL) of trastuzumab-AuNP-111In.

In comparison, non-targeted AuNP-111In at these concentrations reduced the SF of SK-BR-3 or MDA-MB-361 cells by 1.2-fold (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and 1.7-fold (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), respectively. DNA DSBs were greater in SK-BR-3 and MDA-MB-361 cells exposed to trastuzumab-AuNP-111In compared to AuNP-111In, but unlabeled trastuzumab-AuNP did not increase DNA DSBs. Local i.t. injection of trastuzumab-AuNP-111In in CD1 athymic mice with s.c. MDA-MB-361 tumors arrested tumor growth for 70\u00a0days. There was no apparent normal tissue toxicity. The radiation absorbed dose deposited in the tumor by trastuzumab-AuNP-111In was 60.5\u00a0Gy, while normal organs received <0.9\u00a0Gy.These results are promising for further development of trastuzumab-AuNP-111In as a novel Auger electron-emitting radiation nanomedicine for local treatment of HER2-positive BC.A local radiation treatment for HER2-positive BC based on AuNP modified with trastuzumab and labeled with the Auger electron-emitter, 111In was developed and shown to arrest tumor growth with no normal tissue toxicity.",

     "abstract": "Current guidelines for brain PET imaging advice against the injection of diazepam prior to brain FDG-PET examination in order to avoid possible interactions of benzodiazepines with the radiotracer uptake. Nevertheless, many patients undergoing PET studies are likely to be under chronic treatment with benzodiazepines, for example due to the use of different medications such as sleeping pills. Animal studies may provide an extensive and accurate estimation of the effect of benzodiazepines on brain metabolism in a well-defined and controlled framework.This study aims at evaluating the impact of benzodiazepines on brain FDG uptake after single-dose administration and chronic treatment in rats.Twelve Sprague\u2013Dawley healthy rats were randomly divided into two groups, one treated with diazepam and the other used as control group. Both groups underwent PET/CT examinations after single-dose and chronic administration of diazepam (treated) or saline (controls) during twenty-eight days. Different atlas-based quantification methods were used to explore differences on the total uptake and uptake patterns of FDG between both groups.Our analysis revealed a significant reduction of global FDG uptake after acute (\u221216.2%) and chronic (\u221223.2%) administration of diazepam. Moreover, a strong trend pointing to differences between acute and chronic administrations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.08) was also observed. Uptake levels returned to normal after interrupting the administration of diazepam. On the other hand, patterns of FDG uptake were not affected by the administration of diazepam.The administration of diazepam causes a progressive decrease of the FDG global uptake in the rat brain, but it does not change local patterns within the brain. Under these conditions, visual assessment and quantification methods based on regional differences such as asymmetry indexes or SPM statistical analysis would still be valid when administrating this medication.",

     "abstract": "High uptake of [18F]-2-fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG) by inflammatory cells is a frequent cause of false positive results in [18F]FDG-positron-emission tomography (PET) for cancer diagnostics. Similar to cancer cells, immune cells undergo significant increases in glucose utilization following activation, e.g., in infectious diseases or after vaccination during cancer therapy. The aim of this study was to quantify certain immune effects in vitro and in vivo by [18F]FDG-PET after stimulation with TLR ligands and specific antibodies.In vivo [18F]FDG-PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biodistribution was performed with C57BL/6 mice immunized with CpG or LPS. Cellular [18F]FDG-uptake assays were performed with B cells and T cells or with whole spleen cells after stimulation with CpG, LPS and anti-CD3/CD28. In vitro and in vivo activation of B and T cells was examined by concomitant FACS analysis to correlate immune cell activation with the strength of [18F]FDG accumulation.We could show that TLR mediated activation of B cells increases [18F]FDG uptake, and that B cells show faster kinetics and greater effect than T cells stimulated by the CD3/CD28 pathway. In the whole spleen cell population the [18F]FDG signal was triggered mainly by the activation of B cells, corresponding closely to expression of typical stimulation markers. This finding could also been seen in vivo in [18F]FDG-PET/MRI, where the spleen was clearly visible after TLR stimulation and B cells showed upregulation of CD80 and CD86.In vivo TLR stimulation can be visualized by increased [18F]FDG uptake in lymphoid organs. The signal generated in the spleen after immunization might be mainly attributed to the activation of B cells within.Knowledge of the composition of cells that take up [18F]FDG during vaccination or in response to therapy may improve successful treatment of cancer patients in the future.",

     "abstract": "This study sought to evaluate a 99mTc-labeled trimeric cyclic RGD peptide (99mTc-4P-RGD3) as the new radiotracer for tumor imaging. The objective was to compare its biological properties with those of 99mTc-3P-RGD2 in the same animal model.HYNIC-4P-RGD3 was prepared by reacting 4P-RGD3 with excess HYNIC-OSu in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. 99mTc-4P-RGD3 was prepared using a kit formulation, and evaluated for its tumor-targeting capability and biodistribution properties in the BALB/c nude mice with U87MG human glioma xenografts. Planar and SPECT imaging studies were performed in athymic nude mice with U87MG glioma xenografts. For comparison purpose, 99mTc-3P-RGD2 (a \u03b1v\u03b23-targeted radiotracer currently under clinical evaluation for tumor imaging in cancer patients) was also evaluated in the same animal models. Blocking experiments were used to demonstrate the \u03b1v\u03b23 specificity of 99mTc-4P-RGD3.99mTc-4P-RGD3 was prepared with >\u00a095% RCP and high specific activity (~\u00a0200\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol). 99mTc-4P-RGD3 and 99mTc-3P-RGD2 shared almost identical tumor uptake and similar biodistribution properties. 99mTc-4P-RGD3 had higher uptake than 99mTc-3P-RGD2 in the intestines and kidneys; but it showed better metabolic stability. The U87MG tumors were clearly visualized by SPECT with excellent contrast with 99mTc-4P-RGD3 and 99mTc-3P-RGD2.Increasing peptide multiplicity from 3P-RGD2 to 4P-RGD3 offers no advantages with respect to the tumor-targeting capability. 99mTc-4P-RGD3 is as good a SPECT radiotracer as 99mTc-3P-RGD2 for imaging \u03b1v\u03b23-positive tumors.",

Blood clearance of bisphosphonates is usually fast and only 30%\u201350% of the injected activity is retained in the skeleton, while most of the activity is excreted by the urinary tract. A longer blood circulation may enhance accumulation of bisphosphonate compounds in bone metastases. Therefore, a chemically modified macrocyclic bisphosphonate derivative with an additional human albumin binding entity was synthesized and pharmacokinetics of its complex was evaluated. The DOTA-bisphosphonate conjugate BPAMD was compared against the novel DOTAGA-derived albumin-binding bisphosphonate DOTAGA(428-d-Lys)MBP (L1). The ligands were labeled with 68Ga(III) and were evaluated in in vitro binding studies to hydroxyapatite (HA) as well as to human serum albumin. The compounds were finally compared in in vivo PET and ex vivo organ distribution studies in small animals over 6\u00a0h. Binding studies revealed a consistent affinity of both bisphosphonate tracers to HA. Small animal PET and ex vivo organ distribution studies showed longer blood retention of [68Ga]L1. [68Ga]BPAMD is initially more efficiently bound to the bone but skeletal accumulation of the modified compound and [68Ga]BPAMD equalized at 6\u00a0h p.i. Ratios of femur epiphyseal plate to ordinary bone showed to be more favorable for [68Ga]L1 than for [68Ga]BPAMD due to the longer circulation time of the new tracer. Thus, the chemical modification of BPAMD toward an albumin-binding bisphosphonate, L1, resulted in a novel PET tracer which conserves advantages of both functional groups within one and the same molecule. The properties of this new diagnostic tracer are expected to be preserved in 177Lu therapeutic agent with the same ligand (a theranostic pair).",

[11C]2 is potentially suitable for imaging H3 receptors in rat and monkey brains, which has motivated us to perform first-in-human study of [11C]2 for qualifying H3 receptors in human brain. In this paper, we report an efficient radiosynthesis of [11C]2 to obtain sufficient radioactivity and high quality for clinical application.In manual synthesis, we optimized the reaction conditions of desmethyl precursor 1, which contains a 2-hydroxypyridine moiety, with [11C]MeI or [11C]MeOTf. After optimization, we performed automated synthesis and quality control of [11C]2.Bubbling [11C]MeOTf into a heated mixture of precursor 1 and cesium carbonate in DMF at 100\u00a0\u00b0C for 90\u00a0s produced [11C]2 with decay-corrected radiochemical yields of (based on [11C]CO2) 7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a078).

The total synthesis time was approximately 35\u00a0min from the end of bombardment.

The demand of 64Cu with low metallic impurities has increased because of its wide applications when incorporated with antibodies, peptides, and proteins. In this study, we propose a new separation method to produce high-quality 64Cu using a cation exchange column, as well as an automated separation system suitable for large-scale production.64Cu was produced from an electrodeposited 64Ni target via the 64Ni(p,n)-reaction with a 24\u00a0MeV HH+ beam at 10\u00a0e\u03bcA (electrical microampere) conducted for 1\u20133\u00a0h. The irradiated target was transported to a hot cell and disassembled remotely. 64Cu was separated by a solvent mixture of HCl and acetone on a cation-exchange resin, AG50W-X8. The chemical purity of 64Cu final product was evaluated using ion-chromatography coupled with a UV detector and inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy for quality as well as metallic impurities.We obtained 64Cu in dried form at a yield of 5.2\u201313\u00a0GBq at the end of separation, or 521\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012\u00a0MBq/e\u03bcA\u00a0h as the final product within 2.5\u00a0h of processing time. The metallic impurities were a satisfactory low level in the order of ppb. Major contaminants of Co and Ni were lower than those samples obtained by a widely accepted separation using an anion-exchange resin.Using a cation-exchange resin and a systematic operation, we successfully reduced the contamination level of the 64Cu product. As a straightforward separation method, which shortened the entire processing time, we obtained a satisfactory amount of high-quality 64Cu available for routine use.",

     "abstract": "Because of the broad incidence, morbidity and mortality associated with prostate-derived cancer, the development of more effective new technologies continues to be an important goal for the accurate detection and treatment of localized prostate cancer, lymphatic involvement and metastases. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA; Glycoprotein II) is expressed in high levels on prostate-derived cells and is an important target for visualization and treatment of prostate cancer. Radiolabeled peptide targeting technologies have rapidly evolved over the last decade and have focused on the successful development of radiolabeled small molecules that act as inhibitors to the binding of the N-acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamate (NAAG) substrate to the PSMA molecule. A number of radiolabeled PSMA inhibitors have been described in the literature and labeled with SPECT, PET and therapeutic radionuclides. Clinical studies with these agents have demonstrated the improved potential of PSMA-targeted PET imaging agents to detect metastatic prostate cancer in comparison with conventional imaging technologies. Although many of these agents have been evaluated in humans, by far the most extensive clinical literature has described use of the 68Ga and 177Lu agents. This review describes the design and development of these agents, with a focus on the broad clinical introduction of PSMA targeting motifs labeled with 68Ga for PET-CT imaging and 177Lu for therapy. In particular, because of availability from the long-lived 68Ge (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a0270\u00a0days)/68Ga (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a068\u00a0min) generator system and increasing availability of PET-CT, the 68Ga-labeled PSMA targeted agent is receiving widespread interest and is one of the fastest growing radiopharmaceuticals for PET-CT imaging.",

Genipin, a natural dietary compound that blocks uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)-mediated mitochondrial proton leakage, is a potential anticancer agent. We investigated the effect of genipin on glucose metabolism and the mitochondrial function of cancer cells.Breast and colon cancer cells were assessed for effects of genipin on 18F-FDG uptake. T47D breast cancer cells were further evaluated for time-dependent and dose-dependent effects on 18F-FDG uptake, lactate release, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial membrane potential. The effects of UCP2 knockdown were evaluated using specific siRNA.Cancer cells displayed significant reductions in 18F-FDG uptake by genipin. T47D cells showed the greatest reduction to 32.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0% of controls by 250\u00a0\u03bcM genipin. The effect occurred rapidly, reaching a plateau by 1\u00a0h that lasted up to 24\u00a0h. The effect was dose-dependent with a half-inhibitory concentration of 60.8\u00a0\u03bcM. An accompanying decrease in lactate release was consistent with reduced glycolytic flux. OCR was significantly decreased by genipin to 82.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4% of controls, and ROS generation was increased to 156.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016.0%. These effects were largely reproduced by UCP2 knockdown with specific siRNA.Genipin decreased cancer cell 18F-FDG uptake by reducing both glycolytic flux and mitochondrial oxidative respiration. This effect appeared to occur by blocking the ability of UCP2 to dissipate energy and restrict ROS production through proton leakage.",

     "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is a major cause of skin and deep-sited infections, often associated with the formation of biofilms. Early diagnosis and initiated therapy is essential to prevent disease progression and to reduce complications that can be serious. Imaging techniques are helpful combining anatomical with functional data in order to describe and characterize site, extent and activity of the disease. The purpose of the study was to identify and 68Ga-label peptides with affinity for S. aureus biofilm and evaluate their potential as bacteria-specific positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents.Phage-displayed dodecapeptides were selected using an in vitro grown S. aureus biofilm as target. One cyclic (A8) and two linear (A9, A11) dodecapeptides were custom synthesized with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2034-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) conjugated via a lysine linker (K), and for A11 also a glycine\u2013serine\u2013glycine spacer (GSG). The 68Ga-labeling of A8-K-DOTA, A9-K-DOTA, and A11-GSGK-DOTA were optimized and in vitro bacterial binding was evaluated for 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA and 68Ga-A11-GSGK-DOTA. Stability of 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA was studied in vitro in human serum, while the in vivo plasma stability was analyzed in mice and pigs. Additionally, the whole-body distribution kinetics of 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA was measured in vivo by PET imaging of pigs and ex vivo in excised mice tissues.The 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA and 68Ga-A11-GSGK-DOTA remained stable in product formulation, whereas 68Ga-A8-K-DOTA was unstable. The S. aureus binding of 68Ga-A11-GSGK-DOTA and 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA was observed in vitro, though blocking of the binding was not possible by excess of cold peptide. The 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA was degraded slowly in vitro, while the combined in vivo evaluation in pigs and mice showed a rapid blood clearance and renal excretion of the 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA.The preliminary in vitro and in vivo studies of the phage-display S. aureus biofilm-selected 68Ga-A9-K-DOTA showed desirable features for a novel bacteria-specific imaging agent, despite of relative fast blood degradation in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Chemokine receptor-4 (CXCR4, fusin, CD184) is expressed on several tissues involved in immune regulation and is upregulated in many diseases including malignant gliomas. A radiolabeled small molecule that readily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier can aid in identifying CXCR4-expressing gliomas and monitoring CXCR4-targeted therapy. In the current work, we have synthesized and evaluated an [18F]-labeled small molecule based on a pyrimidine\u2013pyridine amine for its ability to target CXCR4.The nonradioactive standards and the nitro precursor used in this study were prepared using established methods. An HPLC method was developed to separate the nitro-precursor from the nonradioactive standard and radioactive product. The nitro-precursor was radiolabeled with 18F under inert, anhydrous conditions using the [18F]-kryptofix 2.2.2 complex to form the desired N-(4-(((6-[18F]fluoropyridin-2-yl)amino)methyl)benzyl)pyrimidin-2-amine ([18F]-3). The purified radiolabeled compound was used in serum stability, partition coefficient, cellular uptake, and in vivo cancer targeting studies.[18F]-3 was synthesized in 4\u201310% decay-corrected yield (to start of synthesis). [18F]-3 (tR \u2248 27 min) was separated from the precursor (tR \u2248 30 min) using a pentafluorophenyl column with an isocratic solvent system. [18F]-3 displayed acceptable serum stability over 2 h. The amount of [18F]-3 bound to the plasma proteins was determined to be > 97%. The partition coefficient (LogD7.4) is 1.4 \u00b1 0.5. Competitive in vitro inhibition indicated 3 does not inhibit uptake of 67Ga-pentixafor. Cell culture media incubation and ex vivo urine analysis indicate rapid metabolism of [18F]-3 into hydrophilic metabolites. Thus, in vitro uptake of [18F]-3 in CXCR4 overexpressing U87 cells (U87 CXCR4) and U87 WT indicated no specific binding. In vivo studies in mice bearing U87 CXCR4 and U87 WT tumors on the left and right shoulders were carried out using [18F]-3 and 68Ga-pentixafor on consecutive days. The CXCR4 positive tumor was clearly visualized in the PET study using 68Ga-pentixafor, but not with [18F]-3.We have successfully synthesized both a radiolabeled analog to previously reported CXCR4-targeting molecules and a nitro precursor. Our in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that [18F]-3 is rapidly metabolized and, therefore, does not target CXCR4-expressing tumors. Optimization of the structure to improve the in vivo (and in vitro) stability, binding, and solubility could lead to an appropriate CXCR4-targeted radiodiagnositic molecule.",

     "abstract": "Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are very attractive targeted drugs, although a large portion of patients remains unresponsive. PET imaging with EGFR targeting TKIs ([11C]erlotinib and [18F]afatinib) showed promise in identifying treatment sensitive tumors. The aim of this study was to synthesize two anti-angiogenic TKI tracers, [11C]axitinib and [11C]nintedanib, and to evaluate their potential for PET.Following successful tracer synthesis, biodistribution studies in VU-SCC-OE and FaDu xenograft bearing mice were performed. Furthermore, tracer stability studies in mice were performed employing (radio-)HPLC and LC\u2013MS/MS techniques. For [11C]nintedanib an LC\u2013MS/MS method was developed to detect the primary carboxylic acid metabolite, resulting from methylester cleavage, in plasma and tumors, because this metabolite is postulated to be important for nintedanib efficacy. LC\u2013MS/MS was also explored to assess the metabolic fate of [11C]axitinib in vivo, since axitinib has an isomerizable double bond.[11C]axitinib and [11C]nintedanib were successfully synthesized with 10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6% and 25.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3% radiochemical yield (corrected for decay), respectively. Biodistribution studies only demonstrated tumor uptake of [11C]nintedanib in FaDu xenografts of 1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02% ID/g at 60\u00a0min p.i. In vivo stability analysis of [11C]axitinib at 45\u00a0min p.i. revealed the formation of predominantly non-polar metabolites (36.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8% vs 47.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.4% of parent tracer and 16.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1% of polar metabolites), while for [11C]nintedanib mostly polar metabolites were found (70.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1 vs 26.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9% of parent tracer and only 2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.6 of a non-polar metabolites). No isomerization of [11C]axtinib was observed in vivo; however, a sulfoxide metabolite could be detected using LC\u2013MS/MS. For [11C]nintedanib, LC\u2013MS/MS revealed formation of the reported primary carboxylic acid metabolite when in vitro plasma incubations were performed, with large differences in plasmas from different species. In vivo metabolite analysis, however, did not demonstrate the presence of the carboxylic acid in plasma or tumor tissue.Reliable syntheses of [11C]axitinib and [11C]nintedanib were successfully developed. Tumor uptake was observed for [11C]nintedanib, albeit modest. The metabolic profiles of the tracers suggest that rapid metabolism is partly responsible for the modest tumor targeting observed.",

In addition, the improvement of its pharmacokinetic profile (PK) was investigated through the co-administration of a succinylated gelatin plasma expander (Gelofusine), aiming to reduce its kidney accumulation and enhance its tumor-to-normal tissue contrast ratios. Biodistribution data were collected from normal mice and rats, and PC-3 tumor bearing mice, in reference to its PK, metabolism and tumor uptake. Imaging data were also collected from PC-3 tumor bearing mice. Biodistribution and imaging experiments showed that 99mTc-BN-O was able to efficiently localize the tumor (5.23 and 7.00% ID/g at 30 and 60\u00a0min post injection, respectively), while at the same time it was rapidly cleared from the circulation through the kidneys. HPLC analysis of kidney samples, collected at 60\u00a0min p.i. from normal mice and rats, showed that the majority of radioactivity detected was due to intact peptide i.e. 56% for mice and 73% for rats. Co-administration of 99mTc-BN-O with Gelo resulted in the reduction of kidney uptake in both animal models. The integrated area under the curve (AUC30\u201360 min) from the concentration\u2013time plots of kidneys was decreased in both mice and rats by 25 and 50%, respectively. In PC-3 tumor bearing mice, an increase of tumor uptake (AUCtumor increased by 69%) was also observed with Gelo. An improvement in tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-normal tissue ratios was noted in all cases with the exception of the pancreas, which normally expresses GRPr. The results of this preclinical study may also be extended to other similar peptides, which are utilized in prostate cancer imaging and present similar PK profile.",

Our aim was to study Auger electron radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 in non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency (NOD/SCID) mice or NOD-Rag1nullIL2r\u03b3null (NRG) mice engrafted with CD123+ human AML-5 cells.The toxicity of three doses of 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 (3.3\u20134.8\u00a0MBq; 11\u201315\u00a0\u03bcg each) injected i.v. every two weeks was studied in non-engrafted NOD/SCID or NRG mice pre-treated with 200\u00a0cGy of \u03b3-radiation required for AML engraftment. Engraftment efficiency of (1\u20135)\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells AML-5 cells inoculated i.v. into NOD/SCID or NRG mice was assessed by flow cytometric analysis for human CD45+ (hCD45+) cells in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen. AML-5 engrafted mice were treated with two or three doses (3.7\u00a0MBq; 10\u00a0\u03bcg each) every two weeks of 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360, non-specific 111In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG, unlabeled CSL360 (10\u00a0\u03bcg) or normal saline. The percentage of hCD45+ cells in the BM and spleen were measured at one week after completion of treatment.111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 in combination with 200\u00a0cGy of \u03b3-radiation caused an initial transient decrease in body weight in NOD/SCID but not in NRG mice. There were no hematological, liver or kidney toxicities. The spleen exhibited 13-fold lower engraftment efficiency than the BM in NOD/SCID mice inoculated with 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells but both organs were highly (>85%) engrafted in NRG mice. Unexpectedly, 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 or non-specific 111In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG caused a paradoxical 1.5-fold increase (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in the proportion of hCD45+ cells in the BM of NOD/SCID mice compared to normal saline treated mice. 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 reduced hCD45+ cells in the spleen by 3.0-fold compared to 111In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0015) but the proportion of hCD45+ cells was not significantly different than in normal saline treated mice. Unlabeled CSL360 decreased the percentage of hCD45+ cells in the BM (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) or spleen (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) in NOD/SCID mice by 1.6-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 or unlabeled CSL360 did not decrease the proportion of hCD45+ cells in the BM or spleen of NRG mice, due to a much higher leukemic burden.111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 and 111In-DTPA-NLS-hIgG caused a paradoxical increase in the proportion of hCD45+ cells in the BM of NOD/SCID mice. This may be due to a priming effect on the BM niche that promotes expansion of engrafted hCD45+ cells, analogous to \u03b3-radiation required for AML engraftment. There appears to be a competition between this effect and the cytotoxic effects of the Auger electrons on leukemia cells. The effectiveness of 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 on reducing hCD45+ cells in the BM or spleen of NOD/SCID and NRG mice was dependent on the leukemic burden.This study demonstrates for the first time a paradoxical radiation priming effect of RIT on enhancing the hCD45+ cell population in the BM and spleen of NOD/SCID or NRG mice. Our results have important implications for preclinical evaluation of radioimmunotherapies for patients with AML.",

Uptake of both tracers was investigated in NTCP, OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 transfected cell lines. Km and Vmax values were determined and compared to [99mTc]-mebrofenin ([99mTc]-MEB). Efflux was investigated by means of CTRL, MRP2 and BSEP transfected inside-out vesicles. Metabolite analysis was performed using pooled human liver S9. Wild type (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and rifampicin treated (n\u00a0=\u00a03) mice were intravenously injected with 37\u00a0MBq of tracer. After dynamic small-animal SPECT and short CT acquisitions, time\u2013activity curves of heart, liver, gallbladder and intestines were obtained.We demonstrated that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are the involved uptake transporters of both compounds. Both tracers show a higher affinity compared to [99mTc]-MEB, but are in a similar range as endogenous bile acids for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. [99mTc]-3a shows higher affinities compared to [99mTc]-3b. Vmax values were lower compared to [99mTc]-MEB, but in the same range as endogenous bile acids. MRP2 was identified as efflux transporter. Less than 7% of both radiotracers was metabolized in the liver. In vitro results were confirmed by in vivo results. Uptake in the liver and efflux to gallbladder + intestines and urinary bladder of both tracers was observed. Transport was inhibited by rifampicin.The involved transporters were identified; both tracers are taken up in the hepatocytes by OATP1B1 andOATP1B3 with Km and Vmax values in the same range as endogenous bile acids and are secreted into bile canaliculi via MRP2. Dynamic small-animal SPECT imaging can be a useful noninvasive method of visualizing and quantifying hepatobiliary transporter functionality and disturbances thereof in vivo, which could predict drug pharmacokinetics.",

To study the circulation time and biodistribution, MP was labeled with 89Zr, a long half-life (78.4\u00a0h) positron-emitting metal which is suited for the labeling of nanoparticles and large bioactive molecule. MP was chelated with 89Zr directly at pH\u00a05, resulting in non-decay-corrected yield of 89.6% and a radiochemical purity of more than 98%. The specific activity was at least190 MBq/\u03bcmol. The 89Zr-MP was stable in human plasma and PBS for at least 48\u00a0h. The half-life of 89Zr-MP was about 15.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.74\u00a0h in iron-overload mice. Biodistribution studies and MicroPET imaging showed that 89Zr-MP mainly accumulated in liver and spleen, which are the target organ of iron-overload.

Hypoxia has been identified as a potential factor in the formation of vulnerable plaque, and it is clear that decreased oxygen plays a role in the development of plaque angiogenesis leading to plaque destabilization. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of copper-64 labeled diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM), a positron-emitting radiopharmaceutical taken up in low-oxygen-tension cells, for the identification of hypoxic and potentially unstable atherosclerotic plaque in a mouse model.64Cu-ATSM PET was performed in 21 atherosclerotic apolipoprotein E knockout (ApoE\u2212/\u2212) mice, 6 of which were fed high-fat diet (HFD) while the others received standard-chow diet (SCD), and 13 control wild type mice fed SCD. 4 SCD ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice and 4 SCD wild type mice also underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging one day prior to 64Cu-ATSM PET.64Cu-ATSM uptake was increased in the aortic arch in SCD ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice (average aortic arch/muscle (A/M) standardized uptake value ratio 7.5\u201330\u00a0min post injection: (5.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23) compared to control mice (A/M SUV ratio 7.5\u201330\u00a0min post injection (3.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.22), p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). HFD ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice also showed similarly increased aortic arch uptake on PET imaging in comparison to control mice. Immunohistochemistry in both HFD and SCD ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed noticeable hypoxia by pimonidazole stain in atherosclerosis which was co-localized to macrophage by CD68 staining. Autoradiography assessment demonstrated the presence of hypoxia by 64Cu-ATSM uptake correlated with pimonidazole uptake within the ex vivo atherosclerotic aortic arch specimens. A significant increase in 18F-FDG uptake in the SCD ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice in comparison to controls was also observed at delayed time points.This pre-clinical study suggests that 64Cu-ATSM is a potential PET tracer for hypoxia imaging in atherosclerosis.While studies in humans are necessary for conclusive data, in the long term, a 64Cu-ATSM PET imaging strategy could help facilitate the study of plaque biology in human patients.",

The in vivo biodistribution of [123I]mIBG in absence and presence of corticosteroids was studied in non-tumor bearing NOD scid gamma mice. Retrospectively, we selected patients with and without corticosteroid treatment prior to [123I]mIBG scintigraphy.A concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of different corticosteroids on the [3H]NE and [3H]DA uptake via OCT3 was illustrated in vitro. The highest OCT3 inhibition was observed for corticosterone, but clinically used corticosteroids, showed also promising inhibitory effects. In contrast, the uptake in neuroblastoma cells was reduced only moderately. Hydrocortisone or prednisolone had only minor effects on [123I]mIBG uptake of both neuroblastoma cells, but reduced uptake in OCT3 expressing cells significantly. In mice tissues, [123I]mIBG uptake was inhibited by corticosteroids especially in the small intestine and kidney. Finally, in one patient with hydrocortisone treatment performed prior to [123I]mIBG scan, heart and liver uptake was reduced compared to untreated patients.The OCT3 is widely spread in many organs and responsible for non-targeted uptake of radiolabeled mIBG. In our study, clinically approved corticosteroids inhibited mIBG uptake in OCT3 expressing cells effectively, whereas tracer accumulation in NT (norepinephrine transporter) expressing neuroblastoma cells showed consistency. We conclude, that a single dose of hydrocortisone or prednisolone prior to [123I]mIBG scintigraphy may improve specificity and reduce radiation dose to non-target organs.",

     "abstract": "Although liposomes hold promise for cancer therapy, the effectiveness of treating myocardial ischemia by promoting angiogenesis has yet to be proved. Nanoliposomes loaded with therapeutic agents can effectively target ischemic myocardium via enhanced permeability and retention. Surface polyethylene glycol (PEG) modification can further facilitate effective targeting by prolonging liposomal circulation. This study aimed to determine whether PEGylated nanoliposomes are effective in facilitating targeted drug delivery and treating myocardial ischemia.Rats subjected to 30\u00a0min of myocardial ischemia were given 99mTc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime- or 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetate-labeled liposomes with mean diameters of ~\u00a0100\u00a0nm or ~\u00a0600\u00a0nm with or without PEG modifications to determine the extent of myocardial uptake in the different conditions. Therapeutic effectiveness was assessed by studying changes in myocardial perfusion defects with 99mTc-tetrofosmin autoradiography and vascular density with immunohistochemistry at 7\u00a0days post-treatment.The liver and spleen showed the largest capacity for liposome uptake. Uptake by the liver and spleen was more pronounced when the liposomes were larger. Conversely, myocardial liposome uptake was significantly greater when the liposomes were ~\u00a0100\u00a0nm rather than ~\u00a0600\u00a0nm in diameter. Surface modification with PEG significantly augmented myocardial uptake of ~\u00a0100\u00a0nm liposomes. PEG modification did not affect the size dependence. To investigate therapeutic efficacy, hearts subjected to ischemia received PEGylated nanoliposomes encapsulated with angiogenic peptides. Our data demonstrated that PEGylated nanoliposomes loaded with angiogenic peptides improved myocardial perfusion defects and increased vascular density. A 10-fold increase in liposomal concentration did not further benefit myocardial ischemia.Liposomal angiogenic formulation with size control and PEG modification may be effective treatment strategy for myocardial ischemia. Increasing the concentration of liposomes does not necessarily benefit myocardial ischemia.",

     "abstract": "Imaging and therapy using radiolabelled somatostatin analogues are methods successfully used in patients with somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-expressing neuroendocrine tumours. Since these techniques were first introduced, many improvements have been made. SSTR expression has also been reported on breast cancer (BC). Currently mammography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound are the most frequent methods used for BC imaging. Since SSTR expression on BC was demonstrated, clinical studies examining the feasibility of visualizing primary BC using SSTR radioligands have been performed. However, to date SSTR-mediated nuclear imaging is not used clinically in BC patients. The aim of this review is to assess whether recent improvements made within nuclear medicine may enable SSTR-mediated imaging to play a role in BC management. For this we critically analysed results of past studies and discussed the potential of the improvements made within nuclear medicine on SSTR-mediated nuclear imaging of BC.Seven databases were searched for publications on BC imaging with SSTR radioligands. The papers found were analysed by 3 individual observers to identify whether the studies met the pre-set inclusion criteria defined as studies in which nuclear imaging using radiolabelled SST analogues was performed in patients with breast lesions. Twenty-four papers were selected for this review including studies on SSTR-mediated nuclear imaging in BC, neuroendocrine BC and other breast lesions. The analysed studies were heterogeneous with respect to the imaging method, imaging protocol, patient groups and the radiolabelled SST analogues used. Despite the fact that the analysed studies were heterogeneous, sensitivity for primary BC ranged from 36\u2013100%. In a subset of the studies LN lesions were visualized, but sensitivity was lower compared to that for primary tumours. A part of the studies included benign lesions and specificity ranged from 22\u2013100%. Furthermore, false negatives and false positives were reported. In the majority of the studies scan outcome was not associated with BC subtype.",

The resulting immunoconjugates were radiolabeled with 90Y to compare radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro and in vivo stability, and in vivo performance in a murine model of ovarian cancer.High radiochemical yields (>95%) were obtained with 90Y-CHX-A\u2033-DTPA-trastuzumab and 90Y-octapa-trastuzumab after 15\u00a0min at room temperature. Both 90Y-CHX-A\u2033-DTPA-trastuzumab and 90Y-octapa-trastuzumab exhibited excellent in vitro and in vivo stability.

Finally, 90Y radioimmunotherapy studies performed in tumor-bearing mice demonstrated that 90Y-CHX-A\u2033-DTPA-trastuzumab and 90Y-octapa-trastuzumab are equally effective therapeutic agents, as treatment with both radioimmunoconjugates yielded substantially decreased tumor growth compared to controls.Ultimately, this work demonstrates that the acyclic chelators CHX-A\u2033-DTPA and H4octapa have comparable radiolabeling, stability, and in vivo performance, making them both suitable choices for applications requiring 90Y.",

Ut the competitive inhibition that galactose shows towards hepatic 18F-FDGal metabolism, we tested the hypothesis that co-administration of galactose, at near-saturating doses, inhibits 18F-FDGal metabolism to a greater extent in non-malignant hepatocytes than in HCC cells. This would increase the tumor to background ratio in the 18F-FDGal PET scans with co-administration of galactose.Three patients known to have HCC underwent two 18F-FDGal PET/CT scans on consecutive days, one with and one without simultaneous constant intravenous infusion of galactose.

Parametric images of the hepatic metabolic function expressed in terms of hepatic systemic clearance of 18F-FDGal were generated from the dynamic PET recordings.Co-administration of galactose did not give significantly better discrimination of the HCC lesions from background. Parametric images of the hepatic metabolic function did not add additional useful information to the detection of HCC lesions compared to the static images of radioactivity concentrations.Co-administration of galactose did not improve the interpretation of the 18F-FDGal PET/CT images and did not improve the detection of intrahepatic HCC lesions, either using static or parametric images.",

It is also used in some experimental studies. Streptozotocin (STZ) administration to rodents causes lesions in very early stages and induces severe and permanent diabetes. Most morbidity of schistosomiasis mansoni is attributed to a granulomatous inflammatory response and associated liver fibrosis. This study was designed to investigate whether STZ administration and schistosomiasis modify the biodistribution of the radiopharmaceutical sodium 99mTc-pertechnetate.Adult female mice were infected by exposure to 100\u00a0Schistosoma mansoni cercariae (BH strain, Belo Horizonte, Brazil) and euthanized after nine weeks. STZ was administered by a single intraperitoneal injection of 100\u00a0mg/kg body weight, 3 or 15\u00a0days before euthanasia. Each animal received 100\u00a0\u03bcl of sodium (Na) 99mTc-pertechnetate (99mTcO4\u2212) (740\u00a0kBq). The animals were divided into four groups: A, uninfected; B, infected; C, uninfected + STZ; and D, infected + STZ. Blood, brain, thyroid, heart, lungs, liver, spleen, pancreas and kidneys were removed. The radioactivity was counted and the percentage of the injected dose of Na99mTcO4 per gram of the organ (% ID/g) was determined.Three days after the STZ injection, there was a decrease of Na99mTcO4 uptake by the liver, lungs, pancreas and kidneys (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in group D when compared with group A. After 15\u00a0days, the decrease of Na99mTcO4 uptake occurred also in the brain, thyroid, heart, spleen and blood (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in group D.We demonstrated modifications on the biodistribution of Na99mTcO4 due to STZ administration and schistosomiasis, possibly due to physiological alterations in some organs.The biodistribution of radiopharmaceutical Na99mTcO4 should be carefully evaluated in subjects with diabetes and/or schistosomiasis infection.",

     "abstract": "The serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) is the most abundant excitatory 5-HT receptor in the human brain and implicated in various brain disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and Alzheimer's disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to image specific proteins and processes in the human brain and several 5-HT2AR PET antagonist radioligands are available. In contrast to an antagonist radioligand, an agonist radioligand should be able to image the population of functional receptors, i.e., those capable of inducing neuroreceptor signaling. Recently, we successfully developed and validated the first 5-HT2AR agonist PET tracer, [11C]Cimbi-36, for neuroimaging in humans and herein disclose some of our efforts to develop an 18F-labeled 5-HT2AR agonist PET-ligand.Three fluorine containing derivatives of Cimbi-36 were synthesized and found to be potent 5-HT2A agonists. 18F-labeling of the appropriate precursors was performed using [18F]FETos, typically yielding 0.2\u20132.0\u00a0GBq and specific activities of 40\u2013120\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol. PET studies in Danish landrace pigs revealed that [18F]1 displayed brain uptake in 5-HT2AR rich regions. However, high uptake in bone was also observed. No blocking effect was detected during a competition experiment with a 5-HT2AR selective antagonist. [18F]2 and [18F]3 showed very low brain uptake.None of the investigated 18F-labeled Cimbi-36 derivatives [18F]1, [18F]2 and [18F]3 show suitable tracer characteristics for in vivo PET neuroimaging of the 5-HT2AR. Although for [18F]1 there was reasonable brain uptake, we suggest that a large proportion radioactivity in the brain was due to radiometabolites, which would explain why it could not be displaced by a 5-HT2AR antagonist.",

The availability of 68Ge/68Ga generator and PSMA-11 ligand from commercial sources is facilitating the production of the radiopharmaceutical in-house. This paper describes our experience on the preparation of ~\u00a0200 batches of [68Ga]PSMA-11 for conducting PET\u2013CT imaging in patients suspected/suffering from prostate cancer.The radiosynthesis of [68Ga]PSMA-11 was done in a hospital based nuclear medicine department using 68Ge/68Ga generator and a manual synthesis module, both supplied by Isotope Technologies Garching (ITG), Germany. The production involved the reaction of 5\u00a0\u03bcg (5.3\u00a0nmol) of PSMA-11 ligand in 1 ml of 0.25\u00a0M sodium acetate buffer with 4\u00a0ml of 68GaCl3 in 0.05\u00a0M HCl for 5\u00a0min at 105\u00a0\u00b0C; followed by purification in a C18 cartridge and collection through a 0.22\u00a0\u03bcm pore size filter.The radiochemical yields obtained were consistently high, 93.19%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.76%, and there was hardly any batch failure. The radiochemical purity of the product was >\u00a099% and the product was stable for over 2\u00a0h; however it was used in patients immediately after preparation. About 200 batches of [68Ga]PSMA-11 were prepared during the period and more than 300 patients received the tracer during the 14\u00a0months of study. No adverse reaction was observed in any of the patients and the image qualities were consistent with literature reports.[68Ga]PSMA-11 with high radiochemical and radionuclidic purity is conveniently prepared by using a 68Ge/68Ga generator and manual synthesis module. The radiochemical yields are very high; and activity sufficient for 3\u20134 patients can be prepared in a single batch; multiple batches can be done on the same day and when needed after a gap of 1.5\u20132\u00a0h.",

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, escitalopram, etc., specifically target SERT binding in the brain.

A one-step preparation of [18F]FPBM, 2-(2\u2032-(dimethylamino)methyl)-4\u2032-(3-([18F]fluoropropoxy)phenylthio)benzenamine, for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of SERT binding in the brain was achieved. An active OTs intermediate, 9, was reacted with [18F]F\u2212/K222 to produce [18F]FPBM in one step and in high radiochemical yield. This labeling reaction was evaluated and optimized under different temperatures, bases, solvents, and varying amounts of precursor 9. The radiolabeling reaction led to the desired [18F]FPBM in one step and the crude product was purified by HPLC purification to give no-carrier-added [18F]FPBM (radiochemical yield, 24\u201333%, decay corrected; radiochemical purity >\u00a099%). PET imaging studies in normal monkeys (n\u00a0=\u00a04) showed fast, pronounced uptakes in the midbrain and thalamus, regions known to be rich in SERT binding sites. A displacement experiment with escitalopram (5\u00a0mg/kg iv injection at 30\u00a0min after [18F]FPBM injection) showed a rapid and complete reversal of SERT binding, suggesting that binding by [18F]FPBM was highly specific and reversible. A one-step radiolabeling method coupled with HPLC purification for preparation of [18F]FPBM was developed. Imaging studies suggest that it is feasible to use this method to prepare [18F]FPBM for in vivo PET imaging of SERT binding in the brain.",

However, little is known about its function in the central nervous system (CNS), where it is most abundantly expressed in hippocampus and amygdala. Since peptide ligands based upon the endogenous decapetide GnRH do not pass the blood\u2013brain-barrier, we are seeking a high-affinity small molecule GnRH-R ligand suitable for brain imaging by positron emission tomography. We have previously reported the radiosynthesis and in vitro evaluation of two novel [18F]fluorinated GnRH-R ligands belonging to the furamide class of antagonists, with molecular weight less than 500 Da. We now extend this work using palladium coupling for the synthesis of four novel radioligands, with putatively reduced polar surface area and hydrophilicity relative to the two previously described compounds, and report the uptake of these 18F-labeled compounds in brain of living rats.We synthesized reference standards of the small molecule GnRH-R antagonists as well as mesylate precursors for 18F-labeling. The antagonists were tested for binding affinity for both human and rat GnRH-R. Serum and blood stability in vitro and in vivo were studied. Biodistribution and PET imaging studies were performed in male rats in order to assess brain penetration in vivo.A palladium coupling methodology served for the synthesis of four novel fluorinated furamide GnRH receptor antagonists with reduced heteroatomic count. Radioligand binding assays in vitro revealed subnanomolar affinity of the new fluorinated compounds for both human and rat GnRH-R. The 18F-GnRH antagonists were synthesized from the corresponding mesylate precursors in 5\u201315% overall radiochemical yield. The radiolabeled compounds demonstrated good in vivo stability. PET imaging with the 18F-radiotracers in naive rats showed good permeability into brain and rapid washout, but absence of discernible specific binding in vivo.The novel small molecule 18F-fluorinated GnRH-R antagonist compounds show high receptor affinity in vitro, and may prove useful for quantitative autoradiographic studies in vitro. The compounds were permeable to the blood\u2013brain barrier, but nonetheless failed to reveal significant specific binding in brain of living rats. Nonetheless, our approach may serve as a foundation for designing PET ligands suitable to image the GnRH-R distribution in brain.",

Thus, PET is the diagnostic method of choice, using radiolabeled NET-ligands derived from reboxetine. So far, [18F]FMeNER-D2 showed best pharmacokinetic and -dynamic properties. However, the disadvantage of reboxetine derived PET tracers is their high metabolic cleavage\u2014resulting in impeding signals in the PET scans, which hamper a proper quantification of the NET in cortical areas.Metabolic stability testing was performed in vitro using a plethora of human and murine enzymes.No metabolism was observed using monoamine oxidase A and B or catechol-O-methyl transferase. Incubation of [18F]FMeNER-D2 with CYP450-enzymes, predominantly located in the liver, led to a significant and fast metabolism of the tracer. Moreover, the arising three radiometabolites were found to be more polar than [18F]FMeNER-D2. Surprisingly, definitely no formation of free [18F]fluoride was observed.According to our in vitro data, the interfering uptake in cortical regions might be attributed to these emerging radiometabolites but does not reflect bonding in bone due to defluorination. Further research on these radiometabolites is necessary to elucidate the in vivo situation. This might include an analysis of human blood samples after injection of [18F]FMeNER-D2, to enable a better correction of the PET-input function.",

Five additional ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice (40\u00a0weeks of age) (Group IV) were imaged with a 99mTc-labeled inactive peptide, 99mTc-LinDUR, to assess 99mTc-duramycin targeting specificity.Focal 99mTc-duramycin uptake in the ascending aorta and aortic arch was detected at 20 and 40\u00a0weeks in the ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice but not in ApoE+/+ mice. 99mTc-duramycin uptake in the aortic lesions increased 2.2-fold on quantitative imaging in the ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice between 20 and 40\u00a0weeks. Autoradiographic and histological data indicated significantly increased 99mTc-duramycin uptake in the ascending aorta and aortic arch associated with advanced plaques. Quantitative autoradiography showed that the ratio of activity in the aortic arch to descending thoracic aorta, which had no plaques or radioactive uptake, was 2.1 times higher at 40\u00a0weeks than at 20\u00a0weeks (6.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.89 vs. 3.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Therefore, optimization of the alkyl side chain length is needed to obtain suitable radioligands based on Cn-7\u03b1-substituted estradiol pharmacophores.We synthesized fluoromethyl (23; C1-7\u03b1-[18F]FES) to fluorohexyl (26; C6-7\u03b1-[18F]FES) derivatives, except fluoropropyl (C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES) and fluoropentyl derivatives (C5-7\u03b1-[18F]FES), which have been previously synthesized. In vitro binding to the \u03b1-subtype (ER\u03b1) isoform of ERs and in vivo biodistribution studies in mature female mice were carried out.The in vitro IC50 value of Cn-7\u03b1-FES tended to gradually decrease depending on the alkyl side chain length. C1-7\u03b1-[18F]FES (23) showed the highest uptake in ER-rich tissues such as the uterus. Uterus uptake also gradually decreased depending on the alkyl side chain length. As a result, in vivo uterus uptake reflected the in vitro ER\u03b1 affinity of each compound. Bone uptake, which indicates de-fluorination, was marked in 7\u03b1-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)estradiol (C2-7\u03b1-[18F]FES) (24) and 7\u03b1-(4-[18F]fluorobutyl)estradiol (C4-7\u03b1-[18F]FES) (25) derivatives. However, C1-7\u03b1-[18F]FES (23) and C6-7\u03b1-[18F]FES (26) showed limited uptake in bone. As a result, in vivo bone uptake (de-fluorination) showed a bell-shaped pattern, depending on the alkyl side chain length. C1-7\u03b1-[18F]FES (23) showed the same levels of uptake in uterus and bone compared with those of 16\u03b1-[18F]fluoro-17\u03b2-estradiol.The optimal alkyl side chain length of 18F-labeled 7\u03b1-fluoroalkylestradiol was the shortest: C1-7\u03b1-[18F]FES. Our results indicate that shorter chain lengths within the 4-\u00c5 ligand binding cavities of ER\u03b1 are suitable for 7\u03b1-fluoroalkylestradiol derivatives.",

     "abstract": "Since 1991 until now, many radiosyntheses of [18F]FLT have been published. Most of them suffer from side reactions and/or difficult purification related to the large amount of precursor necessary for the labeling step. A fully automated synthesis using only commercial and unmodified materials with a reduced amount of precursor would be desirable.We first explored the possibility to elute efficiently [18F]fluorine from commercial and unmodified cartridges with various amount of base. Based on these results, 10\u00a0mg and 5\u00a0mg of precursors were used for the fluorination step. The best conditions were transposed in an automated process for a one pot two steps synthesis of labeled FLT.Using commercial and non-treated carbonate form of QMA cartridges, we were able to elute quantitatively the [18F]fluorine with a very low amount of base (0.59\u00a0mg) and, with only 5\u00a0mg of precursor, to perform an efficient fluorination reaction with up to 94% incorporation of [18F]fluorine. The synthesis was fully automated and radiochemical yields of 54% (decay corrected) were obtained within a synthesis time of 52\u00a0minutes.We demonstrate that a fully automated and efficient radiosynthesis of [18F]FLT is feasible with only 5\u00a0mg of precursor. Compare to the present state of the art, our method provides high yields of pure [18F]FLT and is broadly adaptable to other synthesis automates.",

     "abstract": "Radiolabeled Exendin-4, a synthetic glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, is used as a tracer for diagnostic purposes of \u03b2-cells and in experimental animal research. Exendin-4 can be radiolabeled with 68Ga, 111In or 99mTc and used for positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging to diagnose insulinomas, visualization of pancreatic \u03b2-cell mass and transplanted Islets of Langerhans. In humans, Exendin-4 is widely used as a therapeutic agent for treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The compound, which is administered subcutaneously (SC) may cause nausea, vomiting and a minor increase in the heart rate (HR). However, possible side-effects on cardiovascular functions after intravenous (IV) administration have not been reported. This study describes the Exendin-4 dose at which cardiovascular side-effects occur in pigs and cynomolgus monkeys. The IV effect of the tracer on insulin secretion is also investigated in pigs.Seven clinically healthy littermate pigs (40\u00a0days old) were used; three of them were made diabetic by streptozotocin (STZ). All pigs underwent PET imaging under general anesthesia to examine the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) in \u03b2-cells with radiolabeled Exendin-4. A baseline tracer dose IV [68Ga]Exendin-4 (0.025\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.010\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) followed by a competition dose IV [68Ga]Exendin-4 (3.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.33\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) 60\u00a0min later were administered. Blood samples were taken and analyzed for insulin secretion by using ELISA. Cardiovascular and respiratory variables were monitored throughout the experiment.Immediately after administration of the high dose [68Ga]Exendin-4 the HR rose from 122\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014 to 227\u00a0\u00b1\u00a040\u00a0bpm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and from 100\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05 to 181\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013\u00a0bpm (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in healthy non-diabetic and diabetes-induced pigs, respectively. The tachycardia was observed for >\u00a02\u00a0h and one healthy non-diabetic pig suffered cardiac arrest 3\u00a0h after the IV [68Ga]Exendin-4. Arrhythmia was detected by listening to the heart with a stethoscope up to 4\u00a0days after the [68Ga]Exendin-4 injection. In all animals, no effect on the cardiovascular system was registered after the low dose of IV [68Ga]Exendin-4.

The tumor cell binding affinity of 99mTc-MUC1 peptide was investigated on MUC1-positive T47D and MCF7 breast cancer cell lines. In vivo biodistribution was studied in normal Balb/c mice and in vivo tumor targeting and imaging in MCF7 and T47D tumor-bearing nude mice.The synthesized MUC1-derived peptide displayed high radiochemical and metabolic stability. In vitro tumor cell-binding on T47D and MCF7 cell lines demonstrated high affinity of 99mTc-MUC1 peptide towards human breast cancer cells (binding affinities in nanomolar range). Pharmacokinetic studies performed on Balb/c mice are characterized by an efficient clearance from the blood and excretion predominantly through the urinary system. In vivo tumor uptake in nude mice with MCF7 tumor xenografts was 2.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63% ID/g as early as 1\u00a0h p.i. whereas in nude mice with T47D human ductal breast epithelial cancer cells, the accumulation in the tumor was found to be 2.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.54% ID/g at 1\u00a0h p.i. Also tumor lesion was detectable in \u03b3-camera imaging. The tumor uptake values were always higher than the blood and muscle uptake, with good tumor retention and good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios. A low to moderate (<\u00a05% ID/g) accumulation and retention of 99mTc-MUC1 was found in the major organs (i.e., lungs, stomach, liver, intestines, kidneys, etc.) in both normal and tumor-bearing mice.This study suggests that 99mTc-MUC1 tumor-antigen peptide may be a potential candidate for the targeted imaging of MUC1-positive human tumors and warrants further investigation.",

To validate iodinated antibodies as reliable tracers, we investigated the influence of the radiolabeling method (direct or indirect) on their in vivo stability.Anti-CD105 mAbs were radioiodinated directly using chloramine-T (125I-anti-CD105-mAbs) or indirectly using D-KRYRR peptide as a linker (125I-KRYRR-anti-CD105-mAbs). The biodistribution was studied in B16 tumor-bearing mice via SPECT/CT imaging.Radioiodinated mAbs were stable in vitro.

The indirect radioiodination of internalizing anti-CD105 mAbs leads to more stable tracer by decreasing in vivo deiodination and improves the tumor retention of radioiodinated mAbs.To date, the only antiangiogenic antibody approved for clinical indications is bevacizumab. There is a need to develop more antibodies that have targets highly expressed on tumor endothelium. CD105 represents a promising marker of angiogenesis, but its therapeutic relevance in cancer needs to be further investigated.

To study MMP activity in vivo by means of PET a radiolabeled MMP inhibitor (MMPI) functioning as radiotracer has been developed by our group based on the lead structure CGS 25966.Aiming at the modification of the pharmacokinetics of this lipophilic model tracer a new class of MMPIs has been discovered, consisting of additional fluorinated hydrophilic substructures, such as mini-PEG and/or 1,2,3-triazole units. To identify the best candidate for further clinical applications, radiofluorinated compounds of each subgroup have been (radio) synthesized and evaluated regarding their biodistribution behavior and their metabolic stability.Radiosyntheses of different triazole based MMPIs could be realized using two step \u201cclick chemistry\u201d procedures. Compared to lead structure [18F]FEtO-CGS 25966 ([18F]1e, log D(exp) =\u00a02.02, IC50\u00a0=\u00a02\u201350\u00a0nM) all selected candidates showed increased hydrophilicities and inhibition potencies (log D(exp) =\u00a00.23\u20131.25, IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.006\u20136\u00a0nM). Interestingly, despite different hydrophilicities most triazole based MMPIs showed no significant differences in their in vivo biodistribution behavior and were cleared predominantly via the hepatobiliary excretion route. Biostability and metabolism studies in vitro and in vivo revealed significant higher metabolic stability for the triazole moiety compared to the benzyl ring in the lead structure. Cleavage of ethylene glycol subunits of the mini-PEG chain led to a faster metabolism of mini-PEG containing MMPIs.The introduction of hydrophilic groups such as mini-PEG and 1,2,3-triazole units did not lead to a significant shift of the hepatobiliary elimination towards renal clearance. Particularly the introduction of mini-PEG chains led to an intense metabolic decomposition. Substitution of the benzyl moiety in lead structure 1e by a 1,2,3-trizole ring resulted in an increased metabolic stability. Therefore, the 1,2,3-triazole-1-yl-methyl substituted MMPI [18F]3a was found to be the most stable candidate in this series and should be chosen for further preclinical evaluation.",

After treatment, tumors were measured over fifteen days, tumor volume ratios (TVRs) compared and histopathology performed.Fifteen days after treatment, the TVR of the radioactive bandage treatment group was 3.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5, while TVRs of the non-radioactive bandage treatment and no treatment control groups were 33.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.7 and 26.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a012.6, respectively. At the time of necropsy, there was mild focal epidermal hyperplasia surrounding a small area of epidermal ulceration in the radioactive bandage group. No other examined tissue (i.e., muscle, liver, kidney, lung, spleen and heart) showed significant lesions.Our radiotherapeutic bandage exhibits promising efficacy against SCC of the skin in a mouse model. It can be individually tailored for easy application on tumor lesions of all shapes and sizes, and could complement or possibly replace surgery in the clinic.",

     "abstract": "In previous in-vitro and ex-vivo studies we proved the specific uptake of 99mTc radiolabeled chondroitin sulfate (CS) in human articular cartilage. As a logical next step for the clinical use for imaging osteoarthritis we investigated in-vivo uptake of 99mTcCS in dogs.The radiolabeling of CS Condrosulf (IBSA, Lugano, Switzerland) was performed using 25\u00a0mg of CS and 20\u201340\u00a0MBq/kg body weight of 99mTc by means of the tin method. In-vivo uptake of 99mTcCS was evaluated in dogs (n\u00a0=\u00a012, castrated males, 4\u20139\u00a0years, with 15\u201351\u00a0kg body weight). 6 healthy dogs served as controls and 6 with clinical and radiological signs of osteoarthritis in the carpal, elbow, and tarsal joint were examined. The tracer was i.v. injected into the external cephalic vein. The uptake was monitored after 2, 4, 6 and 24\u00a0h in healthy and osteoarthritic dogs using a planar gamma camera by regional planar or whole body ventral and dorsal acquisition. For whole body scintigraphy animals were under general anesthesia, for planar under sedation only.In healthy control dogs we did not detect any specific uptake of 99mTcCS in the cartilage. In contrast, in the diseased dogs suffering from osteoarthritis a significant, specific, persistent uptake between 4 and 6\u00a0h in tarsal, carpal and cubital joints was documented.Median target (joint) to background (mid antebrachium) ratio (T/B) in the OA joints after 4, 6, and 24\u00a0h was significantly higher than in healthy controls. Target to background ratio using soft tissue as a background (T/S) a similar significantly higher than in healthy controls.In all osteoarthritic joints we found a significant positive correlation (r\u00a0=\u00a00.8, n\u00a0=\u00a020) between grade of disease (I\u2013III) and T/B. When matching radiographic (X ray) changes in osteoarthritic joints (grade II and III) we found also a maximal uptake of 99mTcCS at the specific anatomical site of highest cartilage degeneration. None of the dogs experienced any side effects.These results suggest that 99mTcCS might become a promising diagnostic tool for imaging osteoarthritis. More extensive and detailed examinations are required, however, before extending this methodology for application in humans.",

     "abstract": "In situ inhibition of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) has been recently shown to impressively increase the bioavailability and tumor uptake of biodegradable gastrin radioligands. Furthermore, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) has been previously shown to cleave gastrin analogs in vitro. In the present study, we have assessed the effects induced by single or dual NEP/ACE-inhibition on the pharmacokinetic profile of three 99mTc-labeled gastrins of varying peptide chain length: [99mTc]SG6 ([99mTc-N4-Gln1]gastrin(1\u201317)), [99mTc]DG2 ([99mTc-N4-Gly4,DGlu5]gastrin(4\u201317)) and [99mTc]DG4 ([99mTc-N4-DGlu10]gastrin(10\u201317)).Mouse blood samples were collected 5\u00a0min after injection of each of [99mTc]SG6/DG2/DG4 together with: a) vehicle, b) the NEP-inhibitor phosphoramidon (PA), c) the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril (Lis), or d) PA plus Lis and were analyzed by RP-HPLC for radiometabolite detection. Biodistribution was studied in SCID mice bearing A431-CCK2R(+/\u2212) xenografts at 4\u00a0h postinjection (pi). [99mTc]SG6 or [99mTc]DG4 was coinjected with either vehicle or the above described NEP/ACE-inhibitor regimens; for [99mTc]DG2 control and PA animal groups were only included.Treatment of mice with PA induced significant stabilization of 99mTc-radiotracers in peripheral blood, while treatment with Lis or Lis\u00a0+\u00a0PA affected the stability of des(Glu)5 [99mTc]DG4 only. In line with these findings, PA coinjection led to notable amplification of tumor uptake of radiopeptides compared to controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Only [99mTc]DG4 profited by single Lis (2.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39%ID/g vs 0.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13%ID/g in controls) or combined Lis\u00a0+\u00a0PA coinjection (8.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.61%ID/g vs 4.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.33%ID/g in PA-group). Furthermore, kidney uptake remained favourably low and unaffected by PA and/or Lis coinjection only in the case of [99mTc]DG4 (<\u00a01.9%ID/g) resulting in the most optimal tumor-to-kidney ratios.In situ NEP/ACE-inhibition diversely affected the in vivo profile of 99mTc-radioligands based on different-length gastrins. Truncated [99mTc]DG4 exhibited overall the most attractive profile during combined NEP/ACE-inhibition in mouse models, providing new opportunities for CCK2R-expressing tumor imaging in man with SPECT.",

[3H]choline uptake of macrophages was in the same range as in prostate cancer cells. Lipopolysaccharide stimulation of macrophages resulted in an increase of [18F]FDG uptake in macrophages, but not in an increased [3H]choline uptake.The high [3H]choline uptake in macrophages may be a source of false-positive PET results in diagnosis of prostate cancer by choline-PET/CT. As already known from FDG-PET, discrimination between tumor and inflammation in prostate cancer patients is not possible via choline-PET.The application of choline-PET for reliable primary prostate cancer detection and delineation has to be queried.",

Nuclear medical imaging is one of the useful techniques for noninvasive evaluation of physiological and pathological function in living subjects. Recent progress in nuclear medical imaging modalities enables the clear visualization of the organs of small rodents. Thus, translational research using nuclear medical imaging in transgenic mice has become possible and helps to elucidate human disease pathology. However, imaging of \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs in the mouse brain has not yet been performed. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with 5-[123I]iodo-3-[2(S)-azetidinylmethoxy]pyridine ([123I]5IA) for evaluating \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR availability in the mouse brain.A 60-min dynamic SPECT imaging session of \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs in the mouse brain was performed. The regional distribution of radioactivity in the SPECT images was compared to the density of \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs measured in an identical mouse. Alteration of nAChR density in the brains of Tg2576 mice was also evaluated.The mouse brain was clearly visualized by [123I]5IA-SPECT and probe accumulation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with (\u2212)-nicotine. The regional distribution of radioactivity in SPECT images showed a significant positive correlation with \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR density measured in an identical mouse brain. Moreover, [123I]5IA-SPECT was able to detect the up-regulation of \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs in the brains of Tg2576 transgenic mice.[123I]5IA-SPECT imaging would be a promising tool for evaluating \u03b14\u03b22 nAChR availability in the mouse brain and may be useful in translational research focused on nAChR-related diseases.",

Recently, 1-(2-[19F]fluoroethyl)-dl-tryptophan (1-[19F]FE-dl-Trp) was reported as a good and specific substrate of this enzyme. Herein, the radiosynthesis of its radioactive isotopomer (1-[18F]FE-dl-Trp, dl-[18F]5) is presented along with in vitro enzymatic and cellular uptake studies.The one-pot n.c.a. radiosynthesis of this novel potential PET imaging tracer, including HPLC purification and formulation, has been fully automated on a FASTlab\u2122 synthesizer. Chiral separation of both isomers and their formulation were implemented on a second cassette. In vitro enzymatic and cellular uptake studies were then conducted with the d-, l- and dl-radiotracers.The radiolabeling of the tosylate precursor was performed in DMF (in 5\u00a0min; RCY: 57% (d.c.), n\u00a0=\u00a03). After hydrolysis, HPLC purification and formulation, dl-[18F]5 was obtained with a global radiochemical yield of 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03% (not decay corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a07, in 80\u00a0min) and a specific activity of 600\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0180\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol (n\u00a0=\u00a05). The subsequent separation of l- and d-enantiomers was performed by chiral HPLC and both were obtained after formulation with an RCY (d.c.) of 6.1% and 5.8%, respectively. In vitro enzymatic assays reveal that l-[18F]5 is a better substrate than d-[18F]5 for human IDO. In vitro cellular assays show an IDO-specific uptake of the racemate varying from 30% to 50% of that of l-[18F]5, and a negligible uptake of d-[18F]5.In vitro studies show that l-[18F]5 is a good and specific substrate of hIDO, while presenting a very low efflux. These results confirm that l-[18F]5 could be a very useful PET radiotracer for IDO expressing cells in cancer imaging.",

Once phosphorylated by TK, [124I]FIAU becomes trapped within bacteria and can be detected with positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). [124I]FIAU PET/CT has been shown to detect bacteria in patients with musculoskeletal bacterial infections. Accurate diagnosis of prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) has proven challenging because of the lack of a well-validated reference. In the current study, we assessed biodistribution and dosimetry of [124I]FIAU, and investigated whether [124I]FIAU PET/CT can diagnose PJIs with acceptable accuracy.To assess biodistribution and dosimetry, six subjects with suspected hip or knee PJI and six healthy subjects underwent serial PET/CT after being dosed with 74\u00a0MBq (2\u00a0mCi) [124I]FIAU intravenously (IV). Estimated radiation doses were calculated with the OLINDA/EXM software. To determine accuracy of [124I]FIAU, 22 subjects with suspected hip or knee PJI were scanned at 2\u20136 and 24\u201330\u00a0h post IV injection of 185\u00a0MBq (5\u00a0mCi) [124I]FIAU. Images were interpreted by a single reader blinded to clinical information. Representative cases were reviewed by 3 additional readers. The utility of [124I]FIAU to detect PJIs was assessed based on the correlation of the patient's infection status with imaging results as determined by an independent adjudication board (IAB).The kidney, liver, spleen, and urinary bladder received the highest radiation doses of [124I]FIAU. The effective dose was 0.16 to 0.20\u00a0mSv/MBq and doses to most organs ranged from 0.11 to 0.76\u00a0mGy/MBq. PET image quality obtained from PJI patients was confounded by metal artifacts from the prostheses and pronounced FIAU uptake in muscle. Consequently, a correlation with infection status and imaging results could not be established.[124I]FIAU was well-tolerated in healthy volunteers and subjects with suspected PJI, and had acceptable dosimetry. However, the utility of [124I]FIAU for the clinical detection of PJIs is limited by poor image quality and low specificity.",

     "abstract": "The application of radionuclide-labeled biomolecules such as monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments for imaging purposes is called immunoscintigraphy. More specifically, when the nuclides used are positron emitters, such as zirconium-89, the technique is referred to as immuno-PET. Currently, there is an urgent need for radionuclides with a half-life which correlates well with the biological kinetics of the biomolecules under question and which can be attached to the proteins by robust labeling chemistry. 90Nb is a promising candidate for in vivo immuno-PET, due its half-life of 14.6\u00a0h and low \u03b2+ energy of Emean\u00a0=\u00a00.35\u00a0MeV per decay. 95Nb on the other hand, is a convenient alternative for longer-term ex vivo biodistribution studies, due to its longer half-life of (t\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a035\u00a0days) and its convenient, lower-cost production (reactor-based production).In this proof-of-principle work, the monoclonal antibody bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ae) was labeled with 95/90Nb and in vitro and in vivo stability was evaluated in normal Swiss mice and in tumor-bearing SCID mice.Initial ex vivo experiments with 95Nb-bevacizumab showed adequate tumor uptake, however at the same time high uptake in the liver, spleen and kidneys was observed. In order to investigate whether this behavior is due to instability of \u204eNb-bevacizumab or to the creation of other \u204eNb species in vivo, we performed biodistribution studies of 95Nb-oxalate, 95Nb-chloride and 95Nb-Df. These potential metabolite species did not show any specific uptake, apart from bone accumulation for 95Nb-oxalate and 95Nb-chloride, which, interestingly, may serve as an \u201cindicator\u201d for the release of 90Nb from labeled biomolecules. Concerning the initial uptake of 95Nb-bevacizumab in non-tumor tissue, biodistribution of a higher specific activity radiolabeled antibody sample did show only negligible uptake in the liver, spleen, kidneys or bones. In-vivo imaging of a tumor-bearing SCID mouse after injection with 90Nb-bevacizumab was acquired on an experimental small-animal PET camera, and indeed showed localization of the radiotracer in the tumor area. It is the first time that such results are described in the literature, and indicates promise of application of 90Nb-labeled antibodies for the purposes of immuno-PET.",

Their half-lives are sufficiently long for targeting tumors with antibodies, as well as peptides. Potential radiopharmaceuticals based on radioarsenic require development of suitable bifunctional chelates for stable conjugation of arsenic to vectors under in vivo conditions at high dilution.The thiophilic nature of arsenic led to the synthesis and characterization of a simple trithiol ligand and its arsenic complex, and radiolabeling studies at the no carrier added (NCA) 77As level.1H- and 13C-NMR spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and single crystal X-ray diffraction were used to characterize the trithiol ligand and its arsenic(III) complex. Radiotracer studies with no carrier added (NCA) 77As resulted in high radiolabeling yields (>\u00a096%) with high in vitro stability.The high yield and stability of a single NCA 77As trithiol complex indicates that this framework is suitable for developing matched pair agents for non-invasive in vivo PET imaging and radiotherapy of tumors with 72,77As. This is the first reported chelate developed for NCA radioarsenic and studies are underway for developing a trithiol bifunctional chelate conjugated to a targeting vector, such as a peptide or monoclonal antibody.",

     "abstract": "A2B adenosine receptors (ARs) are commonly defined as \u201cdanger\u201d sensors because they are triggered during cell injury when the endogenous molecule, adenosine, increases rapidly. These receptors, together with the other receptor subtypes (A1, A2A and A3), exert a wide variety of immunomodulating and (cyto)protective effects, thus representing a pivotal therapeutic target for different pathologies including diabetes, tumors, cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary fibrosis and others. The limited availability of potent and selective ligands for A2B ARs has prevented this receptor to emerge both as therapeutic and diagnostic target.Recently, a new class of potent A2B ARs antagonists was developed featuring the triazinobenzimidazole scaffold. Starting from this chemotype, we synthesized a new radiotracer, [11C]-4 (1-[11C]methyl-3-phenyl triazino[4,3-a]benzimidazol-4(1H)-one), and investigated the pharmacokinetics of this compound in vivo to define its potential use in the imaging of A2B AR with positron emission tomography.[11C]-4 showed a very high chemical and blood stability. Results of in vivo and ex vivo experiments underlined the ability of this molecule to bind the A2B AR and correlated with the A2B AR protein and gene expression data.Although further studies are necessary, these data suggest that [11C]-4 may represent a good lead compound for the development of novel selective and potent A2B AR radiotracers, and a new option for the clinical investigation of several pathophysiological processes and chronic diseases.",

[11C]MENET is a novel PET radiotracer with high affinity and selectivity for the norepinephrine transporter. The applicability of different kinetic models on [11C]MENET PET image quantification in healthy population is evaluated.Six healthy volunteers (mean age: 54\u00a0years) were recruited for the study, five of whom underwent arterial sampling for measurement of the input function. Ninety minute dynamic PET scans were obtained on a high resolution research tomograph with 15\u00a0mCi of [11C]MENET injected at the scan start time. Regions of interest were delineated on the PET scan aided by the corresponding MRI image for anatomical guidance. Distribution volumes and their ratios (DVRs) with respect to the occipital reference tissue were calculated using the full arterial model (FAM), the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and the multilinear reference tissue model (MRTM2).Among the FAMs, the single-tissue model was found to be statistically superior to the two-tissue model. [11C]MENET focal uptake was observed in the NET-rich regions of the brainstem and subcortical regions including the thalamus, locus cereleus and the raphe nuclei. Highest DVRs were observed in the locus cereleus (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation: 1.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25) and red nucleus (1.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25).

RIT agents were dosed according to recommended guidelines. Response was assessed using the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma and toxicity was assessed using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. The primary aim was to assess overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). The secondary aim was to assess the impact of variable host and disease factors on the ORR to RIT and OS.Forty-eight patients were treated with RIT within the specified period at SJH&MC; of which 52% with follicular lymphoma (FL) and 46% with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The majority of patients had relapsed or refractory disease (98%). Median duration of follow-up was 17\u00a0months. The ORR was 73% with 44% complete remission (CR) rate and OS of 48\u00a0months. The ORR was 79% with 58% CR rate and OS of 82\u00a0months among FL patients. Among DLBCL patients, the ORR was 65% with 30% CR rate and OS of 39\u00a0months. Response to last therapy before RIT was the only significant predictor of response to RIT and a significant predictor of OS in multivariate analyses. Prior exposure to EBRT did not predict response or survival in multivariate analyses. Toxicity was manageable and predominantly hematologic.RIT is effective and feasible for use in the community outpatient setting.Patients with B-cell NHL can safely receive RIT close to home. With some coordination of effort, it is not difficult for community-based cancer centers to implement this treatment modality.",

High TG2 crosslinking activity has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases including celiac disease, cancer and fibrotic and neurodegenerative diseases. Development of a PET tracer specific for active TG2 provides a novel tool to further investigate TG2 biology in vivo in disease states. Recently, potent irreversible active site TG2 inhibitors carrying an acrylamide warhead were synthesized and pharmacologically characterized.Three of these inhibitors, compound 1, 2 and 3, were successfully radiolabeled with carbon-11 on the acrylamide carbonyl position using a palladium mediated [11C]CO aminocarbonylation reaction.

Quantitative evaluation of the biokinetic data can be performed by using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models. Knowledge about the biodistribution in a pre-clinical setting would allow optimizing the translation from bench to bedside. The aim of this study was to develop a PBPK model to describe the biodistribution of a novel sst2-targeting radiotracer.Biokinetic data of six mice after injection of 18F-SiFAlin-Asp3-PEG1-TATE were investigated using two PBPK models. The PBPK models describe the biodistribution of the tracer in the tumor, kidneys, liver, remainder and whole body via blood flow to these organs via absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.A recently published sst2 PBPK model for humans (model 1) was used to describe the data. Physiological information in this model was adapted to that of a mouse. Model 1 was further modified by implementing receptor-mediated endocytosis (model 2). Model parameters were fitted to the biokinetic data of each mouse. Model selection was performed by calculating Akaike weights wi using the corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc).The implementation of receptor-mediated endocytosis considerably improved the description of the biodistribution (Akaike weights w1\u00a0=\u00a00% and w2\u00a0=\u00a0100% for model 1 and 2, respectively). The resulting time-integrated activity coefficients determined by model 2 were for tumor (0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02) h, kidneys (0.11\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01) h and liver (0.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01) h.Simply downscaling a human PBPK model does not allow for an accurate description of 18F-SiFAlin-Asp3-PEG1-TATE in mice.

Weekly bioluminescence imaging (BLI), FLT and FET PET/CT were used to follow treatment response. Tracer uptake of FLT and FET was quantified using maximum standardized uptake (SUVmax) values and tumor-to-background ratios (TBRs). Survival, the Ki67 proliferation index and micro-vessel density (MVD) were evaluated.In contrast to FLT TBRs, FET TBRs were significantly lower as early as one week after treatment initiation in the anti-VEGF group as compared to the control group. Following two weeks of treatment, both FLT and FET TBRs were significantly lower in the anti-VEGF group. In contrast, no significant difference between the treatment groups was detected using BLI. Furthermore, we found a significantly lower MVD in the anti-VEGF group as compared to the control group. However, we found no difference in the Ki67 proliferation index or mean survival time.FET appears to be a more sensitive tracer than FLT to measure early response to anti-VEGF therapy with PET.Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care FET PET appears to be an early predictor of anti-VEGF efficacy.

     "abstract": "In considering the challenges of approaches to clinical imaging, we are faced with choices that sometimes are impacted by rather dogmatic notions about what is a better or worse technology to achieve the most useful diagnostic image for the patient. For example, is PET or SPECT most useful in imaging any particular disease dissemination? The dictatorial approach would be to choose PET, all other matters being equal. But is such a totalitarian attitude toward imaging selection still valid? In the face of new receptor targeted SPECT agents one must consider the remarkable specificity and sensitivity of these agents. 99mTc-Tilmanocept is one of the newest of these agents, now approved for guiding sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) in several solid tumors. Tilmanocept has a Kd of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a011\u00a0M, and it specificity for the CD206 receptor is unlike any other agent to date. This coupled with a number of facts, that specific disease-associated macrophages express this receptor (100 to 150 thousand receptors), that the receptor has multiple binding sites for tilmanocept (>\u00a02 sites per receptor) and that these receptors are recycled every 15\u00a0min to bind more tilmanocept (acting as intracellular \u201cdrug compilers\u201d of tilmanocept into non-degraded vesicles), gives serious pause as to how we select our approaches to diagnostic imaging. Clinically, the size of SLNs varies greatly, some, anatomically, below the machine resolution of SPECT. Yet, with tilmanocept targeting, the SLNs are highly visible with macrophages stably accruing adequate 99mTc-tilmanocept counting statistics, as high target-to-background ratios can compensate for spatial resolution blurring. Importantly, it may be targeted imaging agents per se, again such as tilmanocept, which may significantly shrink any perceived chasm between the imaging technologies and anchor the diagnostic considerations in the targeting and specificity of the agent rather than any lingering dogma about the hardware as the basis for imaging approaches. Beyond the elements of imaging applications of these agents is their evolution to therapeutic agents as well, and even in the neo-logical realm of theranostics. Characteristics of agents such as tilmanocept that exploit the natural history of diseases with remarkably high specificity are the expectations for the future of patient- and disease-centered diagnosis and therapy.",

     "abstract": "Deficits in cholinergic function have been found in the aged brain and in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). The vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) is a reliable biomarker for the cholinergic system. We previously reported the initial in vitro and ex vivo characterization of (\u2212)-[11C]TZ659 as a VAChT specific ligand. Here, we report the in vivo specificity, tracer kinetics, and dose-occupancy studies in the nonhuman primate brain.MicroPET brain imaging of (\u2212)-[11C]TZ659 was performed under baseline conditions in two male macaques. Tracer kinetic modeling was carried out using a two-tissue compartment model (2TCM) and Logan plot with arterial blood input function and using a simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) and Logan plot (LoganREF) without blood input. Specificity for VAChT was demonstrated by pretreatment with (+)-pentazocine, (\u2212)-vesamicol, or S-(\u2212)-eticlopride. Target occupancy (Occ) was calculated following pretreatment with escalating doses of (\u2212)-vesamicol.Baseline PET imaging revealed selective retention in the striatum with rapid clearance from the cerebellar hemispheres as a reference region. Total volume of distribution (VT) values derived from both 2TCM and Logan analysis with blood input revealed ~\u00a03-fold higher levels of (\u2212)-[11C]TZ659 in the striatum than the cerebellar hemispheres. Injection of (\u2212)-vesamicol either as a blocking or displacing agent significantly reduced striatal uptake of (\u2212)-[11C]TZ659. In contrast, pretreatment with the sigma-1 ligand (+)-pentazocine had no impact. Pretreatment with the S-(\u2212)-eticlopride, a dopamine D2\u2013like receptor antagonist, increased striatal uptake of (\u2212)-[11C]TZ659. Striatal binding potential (BPND, range of 0.33\u20131.6 with cerebellar hemispheres as the reference region) showed good correlation (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.97) between SRTM and LoganREF. Occupancy studies found that ~\u00a00.0057\u00a0mg/kg of (\u2212)-vesamicol produced 50% VAChT occupancy in the striatum.(\u2212)-[11C]TZ659 demonstrated specific and reversible VAChT binding and favorable pharmacokinetic properties for assessing the density of VAChT in the living brain.",

Based on this, the radioisotope was produced in reactor by irradiation of isotopically enriched (98% in 44Ca) CaO target at a thermal neutron flux of ~\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01014 n.cm\u2212\u00a02.s\u2212\u00a01 for 4\u00a0months. Scandium-46 impurity co-produced along with 45Ca was efficiently removed adopting an electrochemical separation approach. The bone specificity of 45CaCl2 was established by in vitro studies involving its uptake in hydroxyapatite (HA) particles and also evaluating its biodistribution pattern over a period of 2\u00a0weeks after in vivo administration in Wistar rats.Thermal neutron irradiation of 100\u00a0mg of enriched (98% in 44Ca) CaO target followed by radiochemical processing and electrochemical purification procedure yielded ~\u00a037\u00a0GBq of 45Ca with a specific activity of ~\u00a0370\u00a0MBq/mg and radionuclidic purity\u00a0>\u00a099.99%. The reliability and reproducibility of this approach were amply demonstrated by process demonstration in several batches. In vitro studies indicated significant uptake of 45CaCl2 (up to 65%) in HA particles. In vivo biodistribution studies in Wistar rats showed specific skeletal accumulation (40\u201346%ID) with good retention over a period of 2\u00a0weeks.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on utilization of 45CaCl2 in the context of nuclear medicine. The results obtained in this study hold promise and warrant further investigations for future translation of 45CaCl2 to the clinics, thereby potentially enabling a cost-effective approach for metastatic bone pain palliation especially in developing countries.",

As a \u03b2\u2212 emitter, 188Re has been considered particularly promising for bone metastases therapy. Aimed at finding innovative bone-seeking agents for systemic radiotherapy of bone metastases, we describe herein novel organometallic compounds of the type fac-[188Re(CO)3(k3-L)], (L\u00a0=\u00a0BP-containing chelator), their in vitro and in vivo stability, and their cellular damage in MDAMB231 cells, a metastatic breast cancer cell line.After synthesis and characterization of the novel organometallic compounds of the type fac-[188Re(CO)3(k3-L)] their radiochemical purity and in vitro stability was assessed by HPLC. In vivo stability and pharmacokinetic profile were evaluated in mice and the radiocytotoxic activity and DNA damage were assessed by MTT assay and by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, respectively.Among all complexes, 188Re3 was obtained with high radiochemical purity (>\u00a095%) and high specific activity and presented high in vitro and in vivo stability. Biodistribution studies of 188Re3 in Balb/c mice showed fast blood clearance, high bone uptake (16.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.3% IA/g organ, 1\u00a0h p.i.) and high bone-to-blood and bone-to-muscle radioactivity ratios, indicating that it is able to deliver radiation to bone in a very selective way. The radiocytotoxic effect elicited by 188Re3 in the MDAMB231 cells was dependent on its concentration, and was higher than that induced by identical concentrations of [188ReO4]\u2212. Additionally, 188Re3 elicited morphological changes in the cells and induced DNA damage by the increased number of MN observed.Altogether, our results demonstrate that 188Re3 could be considered an attractive candidate for further preclinical evaluation for systemic radionuclide therapy of bone metastases considering its ability to deliver radiation to bone in a very selective way and to induce radiation damage.",

The radiochemical purity of the 99mTcO-MNXT complex was measured by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The distribution coefficient and stability of the complex was investigated. The structure of the 99mTcO-MNXT complex was verified by preparation and characterization of the corresponding stable rhenium complex. The cellular uptake of the 99mTcO-MNXT complex was determined in murine sarcoma S180 cell lines under hypoxic and aerobic conditions. The biodistribution and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image studies of the 99mTcO-MNXT complex were performed in mice bearing S 180 tumor.The radiochemical purity of the 99mTcO-MNXT complex was over 90%. It had good in vitro stability and its distribution coefficient indicated that it was a hydrophilic complex. When 99mTc and Re complexes were coinjected in HPLC, both radioactivity (for 99mTc complex) and UV detectors (for Re complex) showed nearly identical HPLC profiles, suggesting their structures are similar. The tumor cell experiment and the biodistribution in mice bearing S 180 tumor showed that the 99mTcO-MNXT complex had a good hypoxic selectivity and accumulated in the tumor with high uptake and good retention. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) image studies showed that the tumor detection was observable.99mTcO-MNXT is prepared from a kit without the need for purification and shows high tumor uptake, tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios, suggesting that it would be a promising candidate for imaging tumor hypoxia.",

Using ROC analysis we tested the ability of a functional imaging metric to discriminate early (F1) from moderate (F2) fibrosis in the absence and presence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, which has not been achieved by any modality other than biopsy.Galactosyl Human Serum Albumin (GSA) was radiolabeled with the positron-emitter, 68Ga, and injected (i.v., 45\u201395\u00a0\u03bcCi, 1.5\u00a0pmol/g TBW) into 44 healthy, 19 DEN-, and 22 CDAA-treated male rats. Quantification of liver function was achieved by calculating T90, defined as the time for the liver to accumulate 90 percent of the [68Ga]GSA plateau value. All livers were excised immediately after imaging and prepared for a \u201cblinded\u201d histologic examination, which included fibrosis and fat content scores. Two sets of fibrosis scores were recorded for all of animals. The dominant fibrosis stage was recorded as the \u201cDominant Pattern\u201d score and the \u201cMaximum Pattern\u201d score was assigned if a smaller distinct region with a higher fibrosis score was observed.Animals with Dominant Pattern F0\u2013F1 liver fibrosis (D\u2212\u00a0=\u00a039) demonstrated significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) faster accumulation of [68Ga]GSA (2.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.52\u00a0min) than those with moderate to advanced Dominant Pattern fibrosis F2 and F4 (D+\u00a0=\u00a026) (3.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.01\u00a0min). ROC analysis (F0\u2013F1 vs F2\u2013F4) produced an area under the binormal curve (AUC) of 0.867\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.045. Twenty-seven of the 65 rats had small regions with higher fibrosis scores. Six of these Maximum Pattern scores reclassified the animals from D\u2212 to D+. ROC analysis of F0\u2013F1 versus F2\u2013F4 rats without liver fat produced AUCs of 0.881\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.053 for the Dominant Pattern Score and 0.944\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.035 for the Maximum Pattern Score.PET Functional Imaging of [68Ga]GSA accurately discriminates early from moderate experimental fibrosis independent of steatosis grade. If validated in human studies, molecular imaging may emerge as a potential alternative to invasive liver biopsy.",

T2 and T20 values, which represent the percent of the injected dose of [18F]PFH in kidneys at 2 and 20\u00a0min after injection, were determined from imaging data. T20/T2 ratio was assessed as a prognostic marker. Rats were euthanized after renography at 26\u00a0wk of age, and kidney weight/body weight ratios (KW/BW%) were determined as a measure of PKD progression.Male and female Cy/+ rats are known to manifest PKD of different severity, male Cy/+ rats display much more severe PKD than female rats. S-Cr and SUN concentrations did not differ between +/+ and Cy/+ rats and between female and male Cy/+ rats at 6\u00a0wk of age, but they were higher at 26\u00a0wk of age and male rats displayed higher values than female rats, which indicates inability of S-Cr and SUN to measure disease severity at an early stage. T20/T2 ratios were higher for Cy/+ than +/+ rats at 6\u00a0wk of age. Importantly, male Cy/+ rats displayed higher T20/T2 ratios than female Cy/+ rats. T20/T2 ratios obtained at 6\u00a0wk of age correlated well with S-Cr, SUN, and KW/BW% values obtained at 26\u00a0wk of age.This study indicates that T20/T2 ratio derived from [18F]PFH PET renography at an early age could be useful as a novel prognostic marker to predict future disease severity in a rat model of ADPKD.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the imaging characteristics of 18F-FDG uptake in brown adipose tissue (BAT) in PET/CT. A total of 2,944 patients who underwent PET/CT from September 2011 to March 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Imaging features of 18F-FDG uptake in BAT were analyzed. Univariate analysis and logistic regression analysis were performed to evaluate the effect of age, gender, cancer status, body mass index (BMI), average daily maximum temperature of imaging month and fasting plasma glucose (Glu) on the positive rate of 18F-FDG uptake in BAT. The results showed that 1.9% (57/2944) patients had 18F-FDG uptake in BAT. 18F-FDG, manifested as flaky, nodular and beaded shape, was symmetrically distributed in the adipose tissues of cervical and supraclavicular, mediastinal, paravertebral, and perirenal areas. Uptake of 18F-FDG within cervical/supraclavicular area was most common (89.5%, 51/57) with an SUVmax ranging from 2.8 to 31.4. Univariate analysis showed that gender and cancer status were not significantly correlated with the BAT 18F-FDG uptake rate. In contrast, age, BMI, Glu and average daily maximum temperature in the imaging month were significantly correlated with the BAT 18F-FDG uptake rate (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Further logistic regression analysis showed that only age, BMI and average daily maximum temperature were significant (OR\u00a0<\u00a01, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Based on the value of OR, the most significant factor that affects BAT 18F-FDG uptake rate was age, followed by the average daily maximum temperature and BMI. We concluded that Chinese adult has low positive rate of 18F-FDG uptake in BAT. Cervical/Supraclavicular is the most common area with BAT 18F-FDG uptake. Age, average daily maximum temperature and BMI are independent factors affecting 18F-FDG uptake.",

     "abstract": "Selective tumor targeting strategies based on cell surface molecules enable new personalized diagnosis and treatments, potentially lowering adverse effects and increasing efficacy. Radio-immunotargeting generally relies on a molecule binding to a cancer-specific target. It is therefore important to understand the properties of molecular interactions in their working environment and how to translate these properties measured in vitro into the in vivo molecular imaging situation.Time resolved interaction analysis in vitro was compared with a corresponding in vivo xenograft mouse model. The antibody fragment AbD15179 was labeled with 125I or 111In, and analyzed on cell lines with differing CD44v6 expression in vitro, and in a dual tumor xenograft model derived from the same cell lines. In vitro LigandTracer measurements were analyzed with TraceDrawer and Interaction Map. Conjugate sensitivity, kinetics, and signal-to-background ratios were assessed for both tumor cells in vitro and xenograft tumors in vivo.In vitro results revealed a general biphasic appearance of a high- and a low-affinity interaction event. The 111In-labeled fragment displayed the largest proportion of the high-affinity interaction with increased sensitivity and retention compared to 125I-Fab. In vivo results were in agreement with in vitro data, with increased retention, higher sensitivity and better contrast for the 111In-labeled fragment compared to 125I.Time resolved binding characteristics measured in vitro largely matched the in vivo performance for the conjugates, which is promising for future studies. In vitro time-resolved LigandTracer assays are efficient, rapid, and in this study shown to be able to predict in vivo outcomes.Further studies are needed to confirm these findings, but the method is promising considering the ethical need to reduce the use of laboratory animals, as well as reducing costs for the development of tumor targeting compounds in the future.",

     "abstract": "68Ga-DOTATATE is a radiolabeled peptide-based agonist that targets somatostatin receptors overexpressed in neuroendocrine tumors. Here, we present our results on validation of organic matrix 68Ge/68Ga generators (ITG GmbH) applied for radiosynthesis of the clinical doses of 68Ga-DOTATATE (GalioMedixTM).The clinical grade of DOTATATE (25\u00a0\u03bcg\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05\u00a0\u03bcg) compounded in 1\u00a0M NaOAc at pH\u00a0=\u00a05.5 was labeled manually with 514\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0218\u00a0MBq (13.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0mCi) of 68Ga eluate in 0.05\u00a0N HCl at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. The radiochemical purity of the final dose was validated using radio-TLC. The quality control of clinical doses included tests of their osmolarity, endotoxin level, radionuclide identity, filter integrity, pH, sterility and 68Ge breakthrough.The final dose of 272\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0126\u00a0MBq (7.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4\u00a0mCi) of 68Ga-DOTATATE was produced with a radiochemical yield (RCY) of 99%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01%. The total time required for completion of radiolabeling and quality control averaged approximately 35\u00a0min. This resulted in delivery of 50%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% of 68Ga-DOTATATE at the time of calibration (not decay corrected).68Ga eluted from the generator was directly applied for labeling of DOTA-peptide with no additional pre-concentration or pre-purification of isotope. The low acidity of 68Ga eluate allows for facile synthesis of clinical doses with radiochemical and radionuclide purity higher than 98% and average activity of 272\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0126\u00a0MBq (7.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03\u00a0mCi). There is no need for post-labeling C18 Sep-Pak purification of final doses of radiotracer.Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care.The clinical interest in validation of 68Galabeled agents has increased in the past years due to availability of generators from different vendors (Eckert-Ziegler, ITG, iThemba), favorable approach of U.S. FDA agency to initiate clinical trials, and collaboration of U.S. centers with leading EU clinical sites. The list of 68Ga-labeled tracers evaluated in clinical studies should growth because of the sensitivity of PET technique, the simplicity of the shakebake approach for the dose preparation and reliability of 68Ge/68Ga generators. Our studies have confirmed the reproducible elution profile, and high reliability of ITG GmbH generators required for routine doses preparation according to FDA recommendations.",

     "abstract": "Deacetylase inhibitors have recently been established as a novel therapeutic approach to solid and hematologic cancers and have also been demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic properties. Although these compounds show a good efficacy in vitro and in vivo, no data on monitoring and predicting treatment response are currently available. We therefore investigated the effect of the pan-deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat (LBH589) on gastrointestinal cancer models and the suitability of 2-[18F]FGlc-RGD as a specific agent for imaging integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression during tumor angiogenesis using small animal positron emission tomography (PET).The effect of panobinostat on cell viability in vitro was assessed with a label-free impedance based real-time analysis. Nude mice bearing HT29 and HepG2 tumors were treated with daily i.p. injections of 10\u00a0mg/kg panobinostat for 4\u00a0weeks. During this time, tumor size was determined with a calliper and mice were repeatedly subjected to PET imaging. Tumor tissues were analyzed immunohistochemically with a focus on proliferation and endothelial cell markers (Ki-67, Meca-32) and by Western blot applying specific markers of apoptosis.In vitro, panobinostat inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 and HT29 cells. Contrary to the situation in HepG2 tumors in vivo, where panobinostat treatment is known to reduce proliferation and vascularization resulting in a decreased tumor growth, HT29 tumors did not show any effect on these parameters. We demonstrated by Western blotting, that panobinostat induced apoptosis in HT29 tumors in vivo. Longitudinal PET imaging studies in HepG2 tumor-bearing mice using 2-[18F]FGlc-RGD demonstrated that the standard uptake value (SUVmax) in HepG2 tumors was significantly decreased by 39% at day 7 after treatment. The comparative PET study using HT29 tumor-bearing animals did not reveal any response of the tumors to panobinostat treatment.Small-animal PET imaging using 2-[18F]FGlc-RGD was successfully applied to the non-invasive monitoring of the HepG2-tumor response to panobinostat in nude mice early after begin of treatment. Thus, PET imaging of angiogenesis using 2-[18F]FGlc-RGD could be a valuable tool to monitor panobinostat therapy in further preclinical studies.When successfully translated to the clinical surrounding, PET imaging of angiogenesis could therefore facilitate therapy planning and monitoring of therapy success with panobinostat in hepatocellular carcinoma.",

     "abstract": "The sigma-2 receptor is a protein with a Heme binding region and is capable of receptor-mediated endocytosis. It is overexpressed in many cancers making it a potential vector for therapeutic drug delivery. Our objective was to introduce an alpha-emitting radionuclide, astatine-211, into a selective sigma-2 ligand moiety to provide cytotoxic capabilities without adversely altering the pharmacological characteristics. In this study we investigated the in vitro/in vivo tumor targeting and estimated dosimetry of alpha-emitting sigma-2 ligand, 5-(astato-211At)-N-(4-(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin-2(1H)-yl)butyl)-2,3-dimethoxybenzamide (211At-MM3), in a pre-clinical human breast cancer model.Astatine-211 was produced in a cyclotron and isolated by dry distillation. Radiosynthesis of 211At-MM3 was performed using a tin precursor through radioastatodestannylation. In vitro sigma-2 binding experiments using 211At-MM3 were carried out in live EMT6 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and liver homogenate tissue. In vivo biodistribution experiments were performed using EMT6 mouse breast cancer cells in BALB/c female mice. Approximately 370\u00a0kBq of 211At-MM3 was administered intravenously and at time points of 5\u00a0min, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24\u00a0h organs/tissue were harvested. Estimated human dosimetry was extrapolated from biodistribution data using OLINDA/EXM (VU e-Innovations).Astatine-211 was successfully produced and isolated in quantities suitable for in vitro and small animal in vivo experiments. Radiosynthesis of 211At-MM3 was reproducible with high radiochemical purity. Astatine-211-MM3 exhibited picomolar affinity to the sigma-2 receptor in contrast to the iodinated analog that had nanomolar affinity. Prolonged tumor targeting was measured through biodistribution studies with a maximal tumor to muscle ratio of 9.02 at 4\u00a0h. Estimated human dosimetry revealed doses of up to 370\u00a0MBq in an adult female patient were below organ radiation limits with the potential to provide a high therapeutic dose to tumors.The sigma-2 receptor could serve as a suitable targeting platform for designing radiotherapeutics. 211At-MM3 showed tumor targeting properties in vitro/in vivo and favorable estimated human dosimetry establishing the proof of concept for future development as a radiotherapeutic for the treatment of breast cancer.",

For the pre-clinical evaluation in pigs, [11C]NS9531, [11C]NS9762 and [11C]NS6417 were prepared by N-methylation using [11C]methyl iodide. These syntheses were later on optimized regarding: 1) choice of labelled precursor; 2) HPLC purification conditions; and 3) formulation using SPE columns. The synthesis protocols were then fully automated on a GE FXc Pro. Preclinical evaluation was performed by PET studies in landrace pigs before and after treatment with citalopram.IC50 measurements showed that all three compounds have low nanomolar affinity for SERT, and micromolar affinity for DAT and NET. The radiochemical yield (r.y.) of all three ligands from [11C]methyl iodide was higher than 30%. From [11C]methyl triflate, the r.y. of [11C]NS9531 and [11C]NS9762 were higher than 80% whereas the r.y. of [11C]NS6417 was 65%.

Positron emission tomography (PET) tracers, imaging the expression of prognostic biomarkers, may contribute to assign appropriate management to individual patients. Aurora kinase A (AURKA) expression is associated with survival of patients after CRCLM resection.We synthesized [3H]alisertib and [11C]alisertib, starting from [3H]methyl nosylate and [11C]methyl iodide, respectively. We measured in vitro uptake of [3H]alisertib in cancer cells with high (Caco2), moderate (A431, HCT116, SW480) and low (MKN45) AURKA expression, before and after siRNA-mediated AURKA downmodulation, as well as after inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) activity.

However, a region-dependent effect may compromise the robustness of quantitative studies. For this reason, we studied the effect of a TQD pretreatment on 5-HT2A imaging with [123I]R91150 and compared results with those obtained in Mdr1a knock-out (KO) rats.Ex vivo autoradiography was performed in TQD (15\u00a0mg/kg) pretreated wild-type (WT-TQD), Mdr1a knock-out (KO) and untreated WT rats for Specific Binding Ratio (SBR) estimation. In vivo dynamic SPECT imaging with serial arterial blood sampling was performed in the former two groups of rats and kinetic analysis was performed with a one tissue-compartment (1TC) model and the Specific Uptake Ratio (SUR). Results were analyzed statistically using repeated measures ANOVA.SBR values differed between WT-TQD, Mdr1a KO and WT rats in a region-dependent manner (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In vivo brain uptake of radiotracer did not differ between groups. Similarly, kinetic analysis provided distribution volume (VT) values that did not differ significantly between groups. SUR binding potential (BPND) values from both groups highly correlated with corresponding VT (r\u00a0=\u00a00.970, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 and r\u00a0=\u00a00.962, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, respectively). However, SUR measured over averaged images between 100 and 120\u00a0min, using cerebellum as reference region, demonstrated values that were, by average, 2.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53 times higher in the WT-TQD group, with the difference between groups being region-dependent (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

     "abstract": "Most breast cancers express estrogen receptors (ERs). Noninvasive imaging of ER expression may be helpful for planning therapy of ER+ tumors. We developed a new ER- binding probe, 99mTc-labeled estradiol, with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) as a chelating ligand, and assessed its targeting ability in vitro and in vivo.3-Aminoethyl estradiol was synthesized in two steps from estrone, followed by 99mTc labeling. Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining were used to detect ER expression in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Saturation binding and specific binding were performed by incubating MCF-7 cells with increasing concentrations of 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol. Cell uptake, efflux, and blocking assays were also performed. To test 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol in vivo, nude mice bearing either MCF-7- (high ER expression) or MDA-MB-231- derived tumors (low ER expression) were injected with 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol, and underwent single-photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT). Mice injected with excess unlabeled DTPA-estradiol were used as controls. Ex vivo gamma-counting of tissues from normal and tumor-bearing mice was used to evaluate 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol biodistribution.The radiochemical purity of 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol was 98.3%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3% with a specific activity of 33.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5\u00a0MBq/\u03bcmol (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining confirmed extensive expression of ERs by the MCF-7 cells, and less extensive expression by MDA-MB-231 cells. There was high binding affinity of 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol to MCF-7 cells with a\u00a0>\u00a045% specific rate of total cell uptake. SPECT images and the biodistribution study results showed significantly higher uptake by MCF-7 tumors (6.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38 %ID/g) than by MDA-MB-231 tumors (1.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28 %ID/g). Pre-injection of MCF-7 tumor-bearing nude mice with excess unlabeled DTPA-estradiol significantly reduced tumor uptake of 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol (2.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28 %ID/g), suggesting that 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol specifically targets ERs in tumors.99mTc-DTPA-estradiol can be synthesized with satisfactory labeling efficiency and stability. 99mTc-DTPA-estradiol specifically targeted ERs in vitro and in vivo with favorable pharmacokinetics, allowing ER receptor expression assessment with SPECT imaging.",

     "abstract": "The objectives of the present work were to improve the cyclotron production yield of 89Zr using a solution target, develop a practical synthesis of the hydroxamate resin used to process the target, and develop a biocompatible medium for 89Zr elution from the hydroxamate resin.A new solution target (BMLT-2) with enhanced heat dissipation capabilities was designed by using helium-cooled dual foils (0.2\u00a0mm Al and 25\u00a0\u03bc Havar) and an enhanced water-cooled, elongated solution cavity in the target insert. Irradiations were performed with 14\u00a0MeV protons on a 2\u00a0M solution of yttrium nitrate in 1.25\u00a0M nitric acid at 40-\u03bcA beam current for 2\u00a0h in a closed system. Zirconium-89 was separated from Y by use of a hydroxamate resin. A one-pot synthesis of hydroxamate resin was accomplished by activating the carboxylate groups on a carboxymethyl cation exchange resin using methyl chloroformate followed by reaction with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. After trapping of 89Zr on hydroxamate resin and rinsing the resin with HCl and water to release Y, 89Zr was eluted with 1.2\u00a0M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 buffer (pH\u00a03.5). ICP-MS was used to measure metal contaminants in the final 89Zr solution.The BMLT-2 target produced 349\u00a0\u00b1\u00a049\u00a0MBq (9.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0mCi) of 89Zr at the end of irradiation with a specific activity of 1.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79\u00a0GBq/\u03bcg. The hydroxamate resin prepared using the new synthesis method showed a trapping efficiency of 93% with a 75\u00a0mg resin bed and 96\u201397% with a 100\u2013120\u00a0mg resin bed. The elution efficiency of 89Zr with 1.2\u00a0M K2HPO4/KH2PO4 solution was found to be 91.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.7%, compared to >\u00a095% for 1\u00a0M oxalic acid. Elution with phosphate buffer gave very small levels of metal contaminants: Al\u00a0=\u00a00.40\u20130.86\u00a0\u03bcg (n\u00a0=\u00a02), Fe\u00a0=\u00a01.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.71\u00a0\u03bcg (n\u00a0=\u00a03), Y\u00a0=\u00a00.29\u00a0\u03bcg (n\u00a0=\u00a01).The BMLT-2 target allowed doubling of the beam current for production of 89Zr, resulting in a greater than 2-fold increase in production yield in comparison with a conventional liquid target. The new one-pot synthesis of hydroxamate resin provides a simpler synthesis method for the 89Zr trapping resin. Finally, phosphate buffer elutes the 89Zrfrom the hydroxamate resin in high efficiency while at the same time providing a more biocompatible medium for subsequent use of 89Zr.",

     "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activity and protein expression levels are often increased in tumor regions. Since PI3K plays a crucial role in regulating cell growth and proliferation, inhibiting PI3K-dependent pathways could be a promising approach for cancer treatment. In clinical practice, however, evaluation of PI3K expression levels is limited to immunohistochemistry of patient samples, which requires invasive biopsies.Here we report the synthesis of three candidate compounds, FMTA-1, 2 and 3, and evaluate their capacity to detect PI3K expression levels with positron emission tomography (PET). Among the three candidates, FMTA-2 showed a lower IC50 value for PI3K. 18F Radiolabeling of FMTA-2 to produce [18F]FMTA-2 was accomplished and its capacity for detecting PI3K expression levels was evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Cell uptake of [18F]FMTA-2 correlated well with cellular PI3K expression levels, and was suppressed by the ATP-competitive PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474. In an in vivo experiment using tumor-transplanted model mice, a higher signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) was seen with [18F]FMTA-2 in animals transplanted with DMS114 cells (expressing high PI3K levels) relative to DU145 cells (expressing low PI3K levels). However, in vivo pharmacokinetics of [18F]FMTA-2 was undesirable and the absolute amount of this compound that accumulated at the tumor region was low. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first trial of a PET tracer for detecting PI3K. Although further improvement of the probe is required prior to clinical application, these results should encourage future work.",

     "abstract": "Imaging fatty acid uptake and utilization has broad impact in investigating myocardial diseases, hepatic functions, tumor progression, and the metabolic state of adipose tissue. The SPECT tracer 123I-15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid (BMIPP) is a clinically used nuclear medicine tracer to image myocardial uptake of fatty acid. Although FTHA (18F-5) has been in clinical use for PET imaging of adipose tissue as well as the myocardium, here we developed a click oleate analog to compare to FTO, with the goal of improved stability to defluorination and suitability for imaging myocardial uptake and oxidation of fatty acids.A rapid and convenient synthetic approach for a precursor to a 18F-labeled oleate analog using click chemistry was developed and evaluated for PET imaging in fasted mice.The overall yield for the preparation of the labeling precursor of the clicked oleate analog was 12%. This precursor was efficiently radiolabeled with F-18 in 17% non-decay-corrected radiochemical yield. PET/CT imaging and biodistribution results show that this fatty acid analog had reasonable heart uptake (0.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28 %ID/g at 0.5\u00a0h p.i.) and heart-to-muscle ratio (2.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39 at 0.5\u00a0h p.i.) and is a potential lead for developing new PET tracers to image fatty acid uptake and utilization using click chemistry methodologies. The synthetic route to FTO was optimized to three steps from known starting materials.While the uptake of the clicked oleic acid analog was sufficient for visualizing the myocardium in mice, the preliminary metabolism data suggest that only a fraction of the uptake was due to fatty acid beta-oxidation. Studies are under way to explore the uptake/oxidation mechanism and kinetics.",

The radiotracer thus formulated was successfully used for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of breast cancer in human patients.The conditions for radiolabeling NODAGA-coupled dimeric cyclic RGD peptide derivative [NODAGA-(RGD)2] with 68Ga were optimized using 68Ga obtained from a 68Ge/68Ga generator developed in-house with CeO2-PAN composite sorbent as well as from a commercial 68Ge/68Ga generator obtained from ITG, Germany. Preclinical studies were carried out in C57BL/6 mice bearing melanoma tumors. The radiotracer was prepared in a hospital radiopharmacy using 68Ga obtained from ITG generator and used for monitoring breast cancer patients by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.68Ga-NODAGA-(RGD)2 could be prepared with high radiolabeling yield (>\u00a098%) and specific activity (~\u00a050\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol) within 10\u00a0min at room temperature by mixing 68Ga with the solution of the peptide conjugate.

     "abstract": "The in vivo binding analysis of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 (VMAT2) to radioligand has provided a means of investigating related disorders. Anesthesia is often inevitable when the investigations are performed in animals. In the present study, we tested effects of four commonly-used anesthetics: isoflurane, pentobarbital, chloral hydrate and ketamine, on in vivo VMAT2 binding to 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ, a specific VMAT2 radioligand, in rat brain.The transient equilibrium time window for in vivo binding of 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ after a bolus injection was firstly determined. The brain biodistribution studies under anesthetized and awake rats were then performed at the equilibrium time. Standard uptake values (SUVs) of the interest brain regions: the striatum (ST), hippocampus (HP), cortex (CX) and cerebellum (CB) were obtained; and ratios of tissue to cerebellum were calculated.Isoflurane and pentobarbital did not alter distribution of 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ in the brain relative to the awake group; neither SUVs nor ratios of ST/CB and HP/CB were altered significantly. Chloral hydrate significantly increased SUVs of all the brain regions, but did not significantly alter ratios of ST/CB and HP/CB. Ketamine significantly increased SUVs of the striatum, hippocampus and cortex, and insignificantly increased the SUV of the cerebellum; consequently, ketamine significantly increased ratios of ST/CB and HP/CB.It is concluded that in vivo VMAT2 binding to 18F-FP-(+)-DTBZ are not altered by isoflurane and pentobarbital, but altered by chloral hydrate and ketamine. Isoflurane and pentobarbital may be promising anesthetic compounds for investigating in vivo VMAT2 binding. Further studies are warranted to investigate the interactions of anesthetics with VMAT2 binding potential with in vivo PET studies.",

In silico prediction software was used to assist in the determination of the metabolite and metabolic pathway of [11C]PBB3.In vivo analysis showed that the molecular weight of a major radiometabolite of [11C]PBB3, which was called as [11C]M2, was m/z 390 [M+H+]. In vitro analysis assisted by in silico prediction showed that [11C]M2, which was not generated by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), was generated by sulfated conjugation mediated by a sulfotransferase.The major radiometabolite, [11C]M2, was identified as a sulfated conjugate of [11C]PBB3.

The aim of this study was to evaluate whether \u03b1v\u03b23 scintigraphic imaging could provide information to determine the optimal combination schedule of bevacizumab and radiotherapy on a lung adenocarcinoma model in mice.The tumor volume and angiogenesis changes induced after bevacizumab and radiation treatment were evaluated using 99mTc-RGD on a microSPECT/CT. First, we determined the optimal dose regimen for bevacizumab and radiotherapy alone.Second, the combined effects of bevacizumab and radiation were evaluated according to the combination timing (radiation 2, 24, 48\u00a0hours after bevacizumab and 48\u00a0hours before bevacizumab).The optimal dose regimen is 20\u00a0mg/kg for bevacizumab and 12.5\u00a0Gy for radiotherapy with a significant decrease of tumoral uptake and volume at day 9 compared to the controls (+\u00a08.8%, +\u00a07.7%, and +\u00a044% volume, respectively, and +\u00a09.8%, +\u00a03.8%, and +\u00a0207% uptake, respectively). Scintigraphic imaging showed a significant increased RGD tumor uptake two hours after bevacizumab treatment compared to 24\u00a0hours and controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). When bevacizumab treatment was combined with radiation, the best combination appears to be the administration of bevacizumab two hours prior to radiation with better results than single treatments (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). On the contrary, bevacizumab given 24\u00a0hours prior to radiation led to less tumor growth delay compared to a single agent, without significant difference compared to the controls. Histological results confirmed these data with an increased percentage of necrosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and a decrease of angiogenesis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) in the optimal combination group.The RGD tracer helps us identify the vascular normalization window and it shows a supra-additive effect of bevacizumab when administered two hours before radiotherapy.",

Our aim was to compare EGFt and hEGF for delivery of 111In to human breast cancer (BC) cells and tumors and evaluate its cytotoxicity against EGFR-positive BC cells, mediated by the Auger electron emissions of 111In.The binding, internalization and nuclear localization of EGFt and hEGF in MDA-MB-468 human BC cells were first assessed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Subcellular fractionation was then used to quantify the cellular and nuclear uptake of 111In-EGFt and 111In-hEGF in MDA-MB-468 cells. The effect of exposure in vitro to 111In-EGFt or 111In-hEGF on the clonogenic survival of MDA-MB-468 (106 EGFR/cell) or MCF-7 cells (104 EGFR/cell) was determined. The pharmacokinetics and tumor and normal tissue biodistribution of 111In-EGFt was compared to 111In-hEGF in CD-1 athymic mice with s.c. MDA-MB-468 and MCF-7 tumors. Nuclear importation in MDA-MB-468 tumors was determined ex vivo by subcellular fractionation.Fluorescently-labeled EGFt and hEGF were bound, internalized and localized in the nucleus of MDA-MB-468 cells. Binding of 111In-EGFt to MDA-MB-468 cells was 8-fold lower than 111In-hEGF, but nuclear importation as a proportion of cell-bound 111In was 3.6-fold greater than 111In-hEGF. Nuclear uptake of 111In-EGFt was lower than 111In-hEGF when differences in cell binding were taken into account. The cytotoxicity of 111In-EGFt (1.0\u00a0MBq/mL; 10 nmols/L) against MDA-MB-468 cells was 9-fold lower than 111In-hEGF but only 2-fold lower at a higher concentration (1.85\u00a0MBq/mL; 40 nmols/L). 111In-EGFt and 111In-hEGF exhibited greater cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells than MCF-7 cells. 111In-EGFt was eliminated more slowly from the blood of tumor-bearing mice and exhibited lower liver uptake but higher kidney accumulation. Uptake of 111In-EGFt in MDA-MB-468 tumors was 2.2-fold lower than 111In-hEGF, and was blocked by anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, nimotuzumab. Nuclear uptake into MDA-MB-468 tumor cells was higher for 111In-EGFt than 111In-hEGF, but when the lower tumor uptake of 111In-EGFt was considered, there were no overall differences.We conclude that the absence of biological activity of EGFt makes it attractive for delivery of Auger electron-emitting 111In to EGFR-overexpressing BC, but its lower cellular and tumor uptake would limit its effectiveness compared to 111In-hEGF.111In-EGFt may reduce the adverse effects previously observed in patients administered 111In-hEGF since it is not biologically active, but its lower uptake by BC cells and tumors would limit its effectiveness for treatment of breast cancer.",

However, the sensitivity and penetrance of optical imaging are poor. It is well known that positron emission tomography (PET) has a high detection sensitivity and Gallium-68 (68Ga) is an optimal PET radioisotope. Thus, in the present study, we developed a novel ligand, 68Ga-NOTA-C6, to image MMP2 activity in tumors.C6 was conjugated with the bifunctional chelator NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic acid) and labeled with 68Ga. In vitro uptake and binding analyses were performed by using SKOV3 cell lines, coincubating with or without the MMP inhibitor doxycycline. The biodistribution and PET imaging were conducted on SKOV3 ovarian tumor models. MMP2 expression in tumors was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC).The non-decay corrected yield of 68Ga-NOTA-C6 was 61.8%\u201363.3%. 68Ga-NOTA-C6 was stable in both physiological saline and human serum. The uptake of 68Ga-NOTA-C6 in SKOV3 cells increased with time, and could be blocked by doxycycline in a dose dependent manner. The results of biodistribution and PET imaging showed that high radioactivity concentrations of 68Ga-NOTA-C6 occurred in tumors.

     "abstract": "This work describes the development and characterization of two antibody fragments that specifically target the \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin, a non-covalent diabody and a disulfide-stabilized cys-diabody. The diabodies were analyzed for their ability to bind both immobilized and cell surface-bound \u03b1v\u03b26. Radiolabeling was done using non-site-specific and site-specific conjugation approaches with N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]-SFB) and the bifunctional chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-triacetic acid maleimide (NOTA-maleimide) and copper-64 ([64Cu]), respectively. The affects of each radiolabeling method on RCY, RCP, and immunoreactivity were analyzed for the [18F]-FB-\u03b1v\u03b26 diabody, [18F]-FB-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody, and the [64Cu]-NOTA-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody.Diabodies were constructed from the variable domains of the humanized 6.3G9 anti-\u03b1v\u03b26 intact antibody. The anti-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody was engineered with C-terminal cysteines to enable covalent dimerization and site-specific modification. Biochemical characterization included SDS-PAGE, Western blot, and electrospray ionization to confirm MW, and flow cytometry and ELISA experiments were used to determine binding affinity and specificity to \u03b1v\u03b26. The diabodies were radiolabeled with [18F]-SFB and in addition, the anti-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody was also radiolabeled site-specifically using NOTA-maleimide and [64Cu]. Immunoreactivities were confirmed using in vitro cell binding to DX3Puro\u03b26 (\u03b1v\u03b26+) and DX3Puro (\u03b1v\u03b26\u2212) cell lines.The diabodies were purified from cell culture supernatants with purities >98%. Subnanomolar binding affinity towards \u03b1v\u03b26 was confirmed by ELISA (diabody IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.8\u00a0nM, cys-diabody IC50\u00a0=\u00a00.6\u00a0nM) and flow cytometry revealed high specificity only to the DX3Puro\u03b26 cell line for both diabodies. RCYs were 22.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6% for the [18F]-FB-\u03b1v\u03b26 diabody, 8.3%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7% for the [18F]-FB-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody and 43.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5% for the [64Cu]-NOTA-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody. In vitro cell binding assays revealed excellent specificity and retention of immunoreactivity ([18F]-FB-\u03b1v\u03b26 diabody\u00a0=\u00a058.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7%, [18F]-FB-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody\u00a0=\u00a080.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.4%, [64Cu]-NOTA-\u03b1v\u03b26 cys-diabody\u00a0=\u00a059.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6%) regardless of the radiolabeling method used.Two novel diabodies with excellent binding affinity and specificity for the \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin in vitro were developed. Radiolabeling of the diabodies with fluorine-18 ([18F]) and [64Cu] revealed advantages and disadvantages with regards to methodologies and RCYs, however immunoreactivities were well preserved regardless of radiolabeling approach.",

Nevertheless, the clinical utilisation of siRNAs is restrained by the poor availability of biodistribution data on this new class of pharmaceutics. This study aimed at defining the biodistribution and pharmacokinetics properties of an siRNA directed to the Casein Kinase-2 beta (CK2\u03b2) subunit, a potential target in cancer therapy.Four CK2\u03b2 siRNAs were chemically modified on each extremity of sense or anti-sense strand and radioiodinated. The biodistribution of each entity was analysed in glioblastoma-bearing mice using nuclear imaging and compared to a control GFP siRNA.The labelling process was associated with preservation of interference activity, except when applied to the 5\u2019 antisense terminus. Radioactivity was predominantly observed in organs of the excretory system after intravenous administration: liver, kidneys and bladder. Tumor/Contralateral muscle ratio showed significant differences depending on the labelling site. Activity associated with CK2\u03b25\u2019s was quite constant over 2\u00a0hours, while CK2\u03b23\u2019as activity decreased by 40% in tumor. Finally, synchrotron X-ray analysis showed that CK2\u03b23\u2019s is more abundant in tumor than in liver, brain or muscle, and uniformly distributed between intra- and extracellular compartments.In this study, we highlighted the large influence of siRNAs radiolabelling position on their biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles, and proposed a systematic approach for the imaging of all siRNAs of clinical interest.",

A similarly effective radioligand with a shorter half-life would usefully allow PET studies of mGluR1 at baseline and after pharmacological or other challenge on the same day. Here we describe the preparation of [11C]FIMX for evaluation in monkey with PET.[11C]FIMX was prepared via Pd-promoted carbonylation of 1-fluoro-4-iodobenzene with [11C]carbon monoxide, aminolysis of the [11C]acyl-palladium complex with the requisite Boc-protected amine, and deprotection with HCl in THF. PET scans of [11C]FIMX injected into a monkey were performed at baseline and after preblock of mGluR1 with measurement of the arterial input function.The radiosynthesis required 42\u00a0min and gave [11C]FIMX in about 5% overall decay-corrected radiochemical yield and with a specific activity of about 100\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol. PET in rhesus monkey at baseline showed that radioactivity peaked high in receptor-rich cerebellum and much lower in receptor-poor occipital cortex. Radioactivity in cerebellum declined to 32% of peak at 85\u00a0min. VT at baseline appeared stable in all brain regions after 60\u00a0min. Under mGluR1 pre-blocked condition, radioactivity uptake in all regions declined more rapidly to a low level. Receptor pre-block reduced VT from 13.0 to 1.5 in cerebellum and from 2.9 to 1.4 in occipital cortex.[11C]FIMX is an effective radioligand for imaging mGluR1 in monkey with PET.",

In this report we describe the radiosynthesis of a novel fluorine-18 labeled radiotracer for PDE7 as well as the in vivo evaluation in mice to verify whether it has potential for imaging of PDE7 in the brain.We have synthesized a potent fluorinated PDE7 inhibitor, [18F]MICA-003 (PDE7 IC50\u00a0=\u00a017\u00a0nM) and the corresponding tosylate precursor for radiolabeling.

We have reported micro-SPECT/CT imaging of Mec-1 human lymphoma xenografts in SCID mice, using [111In]DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate. In order to reduce normal organ accumulation and improve imaging contrast, modified monomers with neutral hydrophilic (serine, TS) or negatively charged (aspartic acid, TD) residues were synthesized as substitutes for glycine at T14 in the PNA sequence. The parent and modified PNA-peptide conjugates were labeled with 64Cu and evaluated in biodistribution studies and high resolution PET/CT imaging of SCID mice bearing bcl-2-postive Mec-1 xenografts as well as bcl-2-negative Ramos xenografts.Mice were administered the 64Cu-labeled conjugates for biodistribution and imaging studies. Biodistributions were obtained from 1 to 48\u00a0h post-injection. Mice were imaged from 1 to 48\u00a0h post-injection.The parent glycine conjugate and two modified conjugates all showed selective tumor uptake in Mec-1 xenografts. The liver uptake of the serine conjugate was significantly reduced compared to the two other PNA conjugates. Its kidney uptake was highest of the three at 47.1% ID/g at 1\u00a0h and dropped to 20.6% ID/g at 24\u00a0h. [Copper-64]DOTA-anti-bcl-2-TS-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate showed tumor uptake of 1.38% ID/g at 1\u00a0h and 1.06% ID/g at 24\u00a0h. The tumor-to-blood ratio was increased by factor of 2 from 1\u00a0h to 24\u00a0h. This compound detected Mec-1 tumors by micro-PET/CT as early as 1\u00a0h post-injection and at time points out to 48\u00a0h. However, the negative control Ramos tumor could not be detected.These 64Cu-labeled, amino acid-modified PNA conjugates showed selective tumor targeting in vivo, and tumor xenografts were detected by micro-PET/CT as early as 1\u00a0h post-injection, suggesting that bcl-2 expression at the mRNA level can detected by PET in mouse models of NHL.Advances in knowledge and implications for patient careDown-regulating bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene, is a mechanism to reverse chemotherapy resistance in humans with NHL. Thus, bcl-2 overexpression might be considered a new independent prognostic parameter in NHL, aiding in the identification of patients at risk for treatment failure. We have developed [64Cu]DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate conjugates for targeted antisense PET imaging. Our preclinical studies identified an effective combination of antisense and radionuclide imaging, with the goal of future clinical trials in patients. This imaging modality may improve clinical care by identifying patients who might respond better to conventional chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR1) is overexpressed in many cancer types. Neurotensin (NT), a 13 amino acid peptide, is the native ligand for NTR1 and exhibits high (nM) affinity to the receptor. Many laboratories have been investigating the development of diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals for NTR1-positive cancers based on the NT peptide. To improve the biological performance for targeting NTR1, we proposed NT analogs with a 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) chelation system and different lengths of spacers.We synthesized four NTR1-targeted conjugates with spacer lengths from 0 to 9 atoms (null (N0), \u03b2-Ala-OH (N1), 5-Ava-OH (N2), and 8-Aoc-OH (N3)) between the DOTA and the pharmacophore. In vitro competitive binding, internalization and efflux studies were performed on all four NT analogs. Based on these findings, metabolism studies were carried out on our best performing conjugate, 177Lu-N1. Lastly, in vivo biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging studies were performed using 177Lu-N1 in an HT-29 xenograft mouse model.As shown in the competitive binding assays, the NT analogs with different spacers (N1, N2 and N3) exhibited lower IC50 values than the NT analog without a spacer (N0). Furthermore, N1 revealed higher retention in HT-29 cells with more rapid internalization and slower efflux than the other NT analogs. In vivo biodistribution and SPECT/CT imaging studies of 177Lu-N1 demonstrated excellent accumulation (3.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4%ID/g) in the NTR1-positive tumors at 4\u00a0h post-administration.The DOTA chelation system demonstrated some modest steric inhibition of the pharmacophore. However, the insertion of a 4-atom hydrocarbon spacer group restored optimal binding affinity of the analog. The in vivo assays indicated that 177Lu-N1 could be used for imaging and radiotherapy of NTR1-positive tumors.",

Biodistribution was conducted in SCID mice bearing A431-CCK2R(+) or AR42J xenografts 4\u00a0h after administration of [111In]1/2/3/4 without or with PA coinjection.Firstly, we observed remarkable increases in the amount of radiopeptides detected intact in the blood of PA-treated mice at 5\u00a0min pi compared to controls. Secondly, we noted impressive enhancement of [111In]1/2/3 localization in AR42J and A431-CCK2R(+) tumors in mice after PA coinjection.

In this study we developed a PET-CT imaging method for non-invasive, quantitative analysis of the effect of ABCB1 and ABCG2 on brain penetration of the anti-cancer drug gefitinib, and demonstrated the applicability of this method for identification and quantification of potential modulators of ABCB1 and ABCB2 using the dual inhibitor elacridar.In vitro cellular accumulation studies with [14C]-gefitinib were conducted in LLC-PK1, MDCKII, and the corresponding ABCB1/Abcb1a and ABCG2/Abcg2 overexpressing cell lines. Subsequently, in vivo brain penetration of [18F]-gefitinib was quantified by PET-CT imaging studies in wild-type, Abcg2\u2212/\u2212, Abcb1a/1b\u2212/\u2212, and Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2\u2212/\u2212 mice.In vitro studies showed that [14C]-gefitinib is a substrate of the human ABCB1 and ABCG2 transporters. After i.v. administration of [18F]-gefitinib (1\u00a0mg/kg), PET-CT imaging showed 2.3-fold increased brain levels of [18F]-gefitinib in Abcb1a/1b;Abcg2\u2212/\u2212 mice, compared to wild-type. Levels in single knockout animals were not different from wild-type, showing that Abcb1a/1b and Abcg2 together limit access of [18F]-gefitinib to the brain. Furthermore, enhanced brain accumulation of [18F]-gefitinib after administration of the ABCB1 and ABCG2 inhibitor elacridar (10 mg/kg) could be quantified with PET-CT imaging.PET-CT imaging with [18F]-gefitinib is a powerful tool to non-invasively assess potential ABCB1- and ABCG2-mediated drug\u2013drug interactions (DDIs) in vivo.This minimally-invasive, [18F]-based PET-CT imaging method shows the interplay of ABCB1 and ABCG2 at the BBB in vivo. The method may be applied in the future to assess ABCB1 and ABCG2 activity at the BBB in humans, and for personalized treatment with drugs that are substrates of ABCB1 and/or ABCG2.",

     "abstract": "Diagnostic radiometals are typically obtained from cyclotrons by irradiating solid targets or from radioisotope generators. These methods have the advantage of high production yields, but require additional solid target handling infrastructure that is not readily available to many cyclotron facilities. Herein, we provide an overview of our results regarding the production of various positron-emitting radiometals using a liquid target system installed on a 13\u00a0MeV cyclotron at TRIUMF. Details about the production, purification and quality control of 89Zr, 68Ga and for the first time 86Y are discussed.Aqueous solutions containing 1.35\u20131.65\u00a0g/mL of natural-abundance zinc nitrate, yttrium nitrate, and strontium nitrate were irradiated on a 13\u00a0MeV cyclotron using a standard liquid target. Different target body and foil materials were investigated for corrosion. Production yields were calculated using theoretical cross-sections from the EMPIRE code and compared with experimental results. The radioisotopes were extracted from irradiated target material using solid phase extraction methods adapted from previously reported methods, and used for radiolabelling experiments.We demonstrated production quantities that are sufficient for chemical and biological studies for three separate radiometals, 89Zr (Asat\u00a0=\u00a0360\u00a0MBq/\u03bcA and yield\u00a0=\u00a03.17\u00a0MBq/\u03bcA), 86Y (Asat\u00a0=\u00a031\u00a0MBq/\u03bcA and yield\u00a0=\u00a01.44\u00a0MBq/\u03bcA), and 68Ga (Asat\u00a0=\u00a0141\u00a0MBq/\u03bcA and yield\u00a0=\u00a064\u00a0MBq/\u03bcA) from one hour long irradiations on a typical medical cyclotron. 68Ga yields were sufficient for potential clinical applications. In order to avoid corrosion of the target body and target foil, nitrate solutions were chosen as well as niobium as target-body material. An automatic loading system enabled up to three production runs per day. The separation efficiency ranged from 82 to 99%. Subsequently, 68Ga and 86Y were successfully used to radiolabel DOTA-based chelators while deferoxamine was used to coordinate 89Zr.",

Tissue uptake and binding selectivity of [11C]methyl-losartan were assessed by ex-vivo biodistribution and in-vitro autoradiography. Radiolabeled metabolites in rat plasma and kidneys were analysed by column-switch HPLC. Both tracers were evaluated with small animal PET imaging. Due to better pharmacokinetics, [11C]methyl-EXP3174 was further investigated via PET by co-injection with AT1R antagonist candesartan or the AT2R antagonist PD123,319.Binding selectivity to renal AT1 over AT2 and Mas receptors was demonstrated for [11C]methyl-losartan. Plasma metabolite analysis at 10\u00a0min revealed stability of [11C]methyl-losartan and [11C]methyl-EXP3174 with the presence of unchanged tracer at 70.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.9% and 81.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0%, of total radioactivity, respectively. Contrary to [11C]methyl-losartan, co-injection of candesartan with [11C]methyl-EXP3174 reduced the proportion of unchanged tracer (but not metabolites), indicating that these metabolites do not bind to AT1R in rat kidneys. MicroPET images for both radiotracers displayed high kidney-to-background contrast. Candesartan significantly reduced [11C]methyl-EXP3174 uptake in the kidney, whereas no difference was observed following PD123,319 indicating binding selectivity for AT1R.[11C]Methyl-EXP3174 displayed a favorable binding profile compared to [11C]methyl-losartan for imaging renal AT1Rs supporting further studies to assess its full potential as a quantitative probe for AT1R via PET.",

     "abstract": "Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an accepted treatment in patients with end-stage heart failure. PET permits the absolute quantification of global and regional homogeneity in cardiac sympathetic innervation. We evaluated the variation of cardiac adrenergic activity in patients with idiopathic heart failure (IHF) disease (NYHA III\u2013IV) after CRT using 11C-hydroxyephedrine (HED) PET/CT.Ten IHF patients (mean age\u00a0=\u00a068; range\u00a0=\u00a055\u201381; average left ventricular ejection fraction 26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%) implanted with a resynchronization device underwent three HED PET/CT studies: PET 1 one week after inactive device implantation; PET 2, one week after PET 1 under stimulated rhythm; PET 3, at 3 months under active CRT. A dedicated software (PMOD 3.4 version) was used to estimate global and regional cardiac uptake of HED through 17 segment polar maps.At baseline, HED uptake was heterogeneously distributed throughout the left ventricle with a variation coefficient of 18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%. This variable markedly decreased after three months CRT (12\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Interestingly, subdividing the 170 myocardial segments (17 segments of each patient multiplied by the number of patients) into two groups, according to the median value of tracer uptake expressed as % of maximal myocardial uptake (76%), we observed a different behaviour depending on baseline innervation: HED uptake significantly increased only in segments with \u201cimpaired innervation\u201d (SUV 2.61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92 at PET1 and 3.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.67 at three months, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).As shown by HED PET/CT uptake and distribution, improvement in homogeneity of myocardial neuronal function reflected a selective improvement of tracer uptake in regions with more severe neuronal damage.These finding supported the presence of a myocardial regional variability in response of cardiac sympathetic system to CRT and a systemic response involving remote tissues with rich adrenergic innervation.This work might contribute to identify imaging parameters that could predict the response to CRT therapy.",

     "abstract": "Radiolabeled phosphatidylserine (PS)-binding peptides represent an innovative strategy for molecular imaging of apoptosis with positron emission tomography (PET). The goal of this study was the radiopharmacological evaluation of radiolabeled peptides for their binding to PS on apoptotic cancer cells, involving metabolic stability, cellular uptake, biodistribution, and dynamic PET imaging experiments.Binding of peptides LIKKPF, PGDLSR, FBz-LIKKPF, FBz-PGDLSR, FBAM-CLIKKPF and FBAM-CPGDLSR to PS was analyzed in a newly developed radiometric binding assay using 64Cu-labeled wild-type annexin-V as radiotracer. Radiolabeling of most potent peptides with fluorine-18 was carried out with thiol-selective prosthetic group [18F]FBAM to give [18F]FBAM-CLIKKPF and [18F]FBAM-CPGDLSR. [18F]FBAM-labeled peptides were studied in camptothecin-induced apoptotic human T lymphocyte Jurkat cells, and in a murine EL4 tumor model of apoptosis using dynamic PET imaging and biodistribution.Peptides LIKKPF and PGDLSR inhibited binding of 64Cu-labeled annexin-V to immobilized PS in the millimolar range (IC50 10\u201315\u00a0mM) compared to annexin-V (45\u00a0nM). Introduction of FBAM prosthetic group slightly increased inhibitory potencies (FBAM-CLIKKPF: IC50\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0mM; FBAM-CPGDLSR: IC50\u00a0=\u00a06\u00a0mM). Radiolabeling succeeded in good radiochemical yields of 50\u201354% using a chemoselective alkylation reaction of peptides CLIKKPF and CPGDLSR with [18F]FBAM. In vivo metabolic stability studies in mice revealed 40\u201360% of intact peptides at 5\u00a0min p.i. decreasing to 25% for [18F]FBAM-CLIKKPF and less than 5% for [18F]FBAM-CPGDLSR at 15\u00a0min p.i.. Cell binding of [18F]FBAM-CLIKKPF in drug-treated Jurkat cells was significantly higher compared to untreated cells, but this was not observed for [18F]FBAM-CPGDLSR. Dynamic PET imaging experiments showed that baseline uptake of [18F]FBAM-CLIKKPF in EL4 tumors was higher (SUV5min 0.46, SUV60min 0.13) compared to [18F]FBAM-CPGDLSR (SUV5min 0.16, SUV60min 0.10). Drug-treated EL4 tumors did not show an increased uptake for both [18F]FBAM-labeled peptides.Although both 18F-labeled peptides [18F]FBAM-CLIKKPF and [18F]FBAM-CPGDLSR showed higher binding to apoptotic Jurkat cells in vitro, their in vivo uptake profiles were not different in apoptotic EL4 tumors. This may explained by the relatively low potency of both compounds to compete with binding of 64Cu-labeled annexin-V to PS. Overall the novel competitive radiometric PS-binding assay with 64Cu-labeled annexin-V represents a versatile and very robust screening platform to analyze potential PS-binding compounds in vitro. Further studies will be necessary to evaluate alternative peptide structures toward their use as PET radiotracers imaging apoptosis in vivo.Development of peptide-based radiotracers for imaging apoptosis in vivo remains a significant challenge.",

Therefore, (+)-[131I]pIV significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation in tumor-bearing mice. In the present study, we report the synthesis and the in vitro and in vivo characterization of (+)-[211At]pAtV, an 211At-labeled sigma receptor ligand, that has potential use in alpha-radionuclide receptor therapy.The radiolabeled sigma receptor ligand (+)-[211At]pAtV was prepared using a standard halogenation reaction generating a 91% radiochemical yield with 98% purity after HPLC purification.

The resulting 64Cu-NOTA-amatuximab was purified with a PD 10 column. To investigate the dose effect or the effect of tumor size, the BD was performed in groups of nude mice (n\u00a0=\u00a05) with mesothelin-expressing A431/H9 tumors (range, 80\u2013300\u00a0mm3) one day after iv injection of 64Cu-NOTA-amatuximab (10\u00a0\u03bcCi) containing a total amatuximab dose of 2, 30, or 60\u00a0\u03bcg. The BD and PET imaging were also investigated 3, 24 and 48\u00a0h after injecting a total dose of 30\u00a0\u03bcg (10\u00a0\u03bcCi for BD), and 2 or 60\u00a0\u03bcg (300\u00a0\u03bcCi for PET), respectively.Comparing the results of the BDs from three different injection doses, the major difference was shown in the uptake (%ID/g) of the radiolabel in tumor, liver and blood. The tumor uptake and blood retention from 30 and 60\u00a0\u03bcg doses were greater than those from 2\u00a0\u03bcg dose, whereas the liver uptake was smaller. The BD studies also demonstrated a positive correlation between tumor size (or the level of shed mesothelin in blood) and liver uptake. However, there was a negative correlation between tumor size (or the shed mesothelin level) and tumor uptake and between tumor size and blood retention. These findings were confirmed by the PET imaging study, which clearly visualized the tumor uptake with the radiolabel concentrated in the tumor core and produced a tumor to liver ratio of 1.2 at 24\u00a0h post-injection with 60\u00a0\u03bcg amatuximab, whereas the injection of 2\u00a0\u03bcg amatuximab produced a tumor to liver ratio of 0.4 at 24\u00a0h post-injection.Our studies using a nude mouse model of A431/H9 tumor demonstrated that the injection of a high amatuximab dose (30 to 60\u00a0\u03bcg) could provide a beneficial effect in maximizing tumor uptake while maintaining minimum liver and spleen uptakes of the radiolabel, and in facilitating its penetration into the tumor core.",

Our previous study showed that ASCT2 (Na+-dependent amino acid transporter (AAT)) mediates fluciclovine uptake in androgen-dependent PCa cells; its expression is influenced by androgen, a key hormone in the progression of primary PCa and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In this study, we investigated the uptake mechanisms and feasibility of [18F]fluciclovine for CRPC in the androgen-dependent PCa cell line LNCaP and LNCaP-derivatives LNCaP-SF and LN-REC4.LNCaP-SF was established after long-term cultivation of LNCaP in steroid-free conditions, and LN-Pre and LN-REC4 were established from LNCaP inoculated in intact and castrated severe combined immunodeficient mice, respectively. Uptake and competitive inhibition experiments were performed with trans-1-amino-3-fluoro[1-14C]cyclobutanecarboxylic acid ([14C]fluciclovine) to characterize the involvement of AATs in androgen-dependent PCa (LNCaP and LN-Pre) and CRPC-like (LNCaP-SF and LN-REC4) cell lines. AAT expression was analyzed by Western blotting, and [14C]fluciclovine uptake in androgen-dependent PCa and CRPC-like cell lines were investigated in the presence or absence of dihydrotestosterone (DHT).The contribution of Na+-dependent AATs to [14C]fluciclovine uptake in all cell lines was 88\u221298%, and [14C]fluciclovine uptake was strongly inhibited by l-glutamine and l-serine, the substrates for Na+-dependent alanine-serine-cysteine (system ASC) AATs, in the presence of Na+. DHT enhanced ASCT2 expression in LNCaP, LN-Pre, and LN-REC4, but not in LNCaP-SF, and the responses of ASCT2 expression to DHT correlated with [14C]fluciclovine uptake.System ASC, especially ASCT2, could play a major role in [14C]fluciclovine uptake into CRPC-like and androgen-dependent PCa cells, suggesting [18F]fluciclovine-PET is applicable to the detection of CRPC as well as androgen-dependent PCa.[18F]fluciclovine-PET may be applied for the detection of CRPC.[18F]fluciclovine-PET may permit early intervention for CRPC treatment.",

The reaction was performed at atmospheric pressure using xantphos as supporting phosphine ligand and palladium (\u03c0-cinnamyl) chloride dimer as the palladium source. ([11C]Methyl)raclopride was prepared by a previously published method. In the PET study, two female cynomolgus monkeys were used under gas anesthesia of sevoflurane. A dynamic PET measurement was performed for 63\u00a0min with an HRRT PET camera after intravenous injection of ([11C]carbonyl)raclopride and ([11C]methyl)raclopride, respectively, during the same day. The order of injection of the two PET radioligands was changed between the two monkeys. The venous blood sample for measurement of protein binding was taken 3\u00a0min prior to the PET scan. Binding potential (BPND) of the putamen and caudate was calculated with SRTM using the cerebellum as a reference region.The target compound ([11C]carbonyl)raclopride was obtained with 50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% decay corrected radiochemical yield and 95% radiochemical purity. The trapping efficiency (TE) of [11C]carbon monoxide was 65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% and the specific radioactivity of the final product was 34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol after a 50\u00a0min of synthesis time.

The maximum FDG uptake of the primary tumor was defined according to SUVmax and SULmax. Multiple threshold levels between 60% and 10% of the SUVmax and SULmax were tested with intervals of 5% to 10% in order to define the most suitable threshold value for the metabolic activity of each patient's tumor (adaptive threshold). MTV was calculated according to this value. We evaluted the relationship of mean values of MTV, SUVmax and SULmax with treatment response, local recurrence, distant metastasis and disease-related death. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was done to obtain optimal predictive cut-off values for MTV and SULmax which were found to have a predictive value. Local recurrence-free (LRFS), disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined according to these cut-offs.Forty six patients had complete response, 15 had partial response, and 1 had stable disease 6\u00a0weeks after the completion of treatment. Median follow-up of the entire cohort was 18\u00a0months. Of 46 complete responders 10 had local recurrence, and of 16 partial or no responders 10 had local progression. Eighteen patients died.

In vitro autoradiography ([18\u00a0F]DPA-714) and IHC (CD68, GFAP and TSPO) confirmed local neuroinflammation in this model. Dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MRI demonstrated BBB breakdown near the LPS injection site at day 1, which gradually resolved over time and was absent at 1\u00a0month after LPS injection.The LPS model is useful for first screening of newly developed tracers because of the easy design and the robust, unilateral inflammatory reaction allowing the use of the contralateral region as control. Additionally, this model can be used to test and follow up the benefits of anti-inflammatory therapies by non-invasive imaging.",

     "abstract": "Functional imaging could be utilized for visualizing pancreatic islets of Langerhans. Therefore, we present a stepwise algorithm for screening of clinically available positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for their use in imaging of the neuroendocrine pancreas in the context of diabetes.A stepwise procedure was developed for screening potential islet imaging agents. Suitable PET-tracer candidates were identified by their molecular mechanism of targeting. Clinical abdominal examinations were retrospectively analyzed for pancreatic uptake and retention. The target protein localization in the pancreas was assessed in silico by \u2013omics approaches and the in vitro by binding assays to human pancreatic tissue.Six putative candidates were identified and screened by using the stepwise procedure. Among the tested PET tracers, only [11C]5-Hydroxy-tryptophan passed all steps. The remaining identified candidates were falsified as candidates and discarded following in silico and in vitro screening.Of the six clinically available PET tracers identified, [11C]5-HTP was found to be a promising candidate for beta cell imaging, based on intensity of in vivo pancreatic uptake in humans, and islet specificity as assessed on human pancreatic cell preparations. The flow scheme described herein constitutes a methodology for evaluating putative islet imaging biomarkers among clinically available PET tracers.",

     "abstract": "Application of therapeutic folate radioconjugates is a promising option for the treatment of folate receptor (FR)-positive tumors, although high uptake of radiofolates in the kidneys remains a critical issue. Recently, it was shown that enhancing the blood circulation of radiofolates results in increased tumor uptake and reduced retention of radioactivity in the kidneys. In this study, we investigated and compared the anti-tumor effects and potential long-term damage to the kidneys after application of an albumin-binding (177Lu-cm09), and a conventional (177Lu-EC0800) folate radioconjugate.In vivo studies were performed with KB tumor-bearing nude mice. 177Lu-EC0800 and 177Lu-cm09 were applied at variable quantities (10\u201330\u00a0MBq/mouse), and the tumor growth was monitored over time. Mice without tumors were injected with the same radiofolates and investigated over eight months by determination of creatinine and blood urea nitrogen plasma levels and by measuring renal uptake of 99mTc-DMSA using SPECT. At the study end, the morphological changes were examined on renal tissue sections using variable staining methods.Compared to untreated controls, dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition and prolonged survival was observed in all treated mice. In line with the resulting absorbed dose, the treatment was more effective with 177Lu-cm09 than with 177Lu-EC0800, enabling complete tumor remission after application of \u2265\u00a020\u00a0MBq (\u2265\u00a028\u00a0Gy). Application of radiofolates with an absorbed renal dose \u2265\u00a023\u00a0Gy showed increased levels of renal plasma parameters and reduced renal uptake of 99mTc-DSMA. Morphological changes observed on tissue sections confirmed radionephropathy of variable stages.177Lu-cm09 showed more favorable anti-tumor effects and significantly less damage to the kidneys compared to 177Lu-EC0800 as was expected based on improved tumor-to-kidney ratios. It was demonstrated that enhancing the blood circulation time of radiofolates was favorable regarding the risk\u2013benefit profile of a therapeutic application. These results hold promise for future translation of the albumin-binder concept to the clinics, potentially enabling FR-targeted radionuclide therapy in patients.",

X-ray crystallography was performed on the PSMA/5 complex. [18F]5 was synthesized, and cell uptake and internalization studies were conducted in PSMA(+) LNCaP and CWR22Rv1 cells and PSMA(\u2212) PC-3 cells. In vivo PET imaging and biodistribution studies were performed at 1 and 4\u00a0h post injection in mice bearing CWR22Rv1 tumor, with or without blocking agent.The crystallographic data showed interaction of the p-fluorobenzoyl group with an arene-binding cleft on the PSMA surface. In vitro studies revealed elevated uptake of [18F]5 in PSMA(+) cells (2.2% in CWR22Rv1 and 12.1% in LNCaP) compared to PSMA(\u2212) cells (0.08%) at 4\u00a0h. In vivo tumor uptake of 2.33% ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratio of 265:1 was observed at 4\u00a0h.We have successfully synthesized, radiolabeled and evaluated a new PSMA-targeted PET agent. The crystal structure of the PSMA/5 complex highlighted the interactions within the arene-binding cleft contributing to the overall complex stability. The high target uptake and rapid non-target clearance exhibited by [18F]5 in PSMA(+) xenografts substantiates its potential use for PET imaging of PCa.The only FDA-approved imaging agent for PCa, Prostascint\u00ae, targets PSMA but suffers from inherent shortcomings.

PET imaging with 18F-FDOPA allows in vivo assessment of the metabolism of glioma relative to surrounding tissues. The high sensitivity of 18F-DOPA imaging grants utility for a number of clinical applications.A collection of published work about 18F-FDOPA PET was made and a critical review was discussed and written.A number of research papers have been published demonstrating that in conjunction with MRI, 18F-FDOPA PET provides greater sensitivity and specificity than these modalities in detection, grading, prognosis and validation of treatment success in both primary and recurrent gliomas. In further comparisons with 11C-MET, 18F-FLT, 18F-FET and MRI, 18F-FDOPA has shown similar or better efficacy. Recently synthesis cassettes have become available, making 18F-FDOPA more accessible.According to the available data, 18F-FDOPA PET is a viable radiotracer for imaging and treatment planning of gliomas.18F-FDOPA PET appears to be a viable radiopharmaceutical for the diagnosis and treatment planning of gliomas cases, improving on that of MRI and 18F-FDG PET.",

This compound was developed by optimizing the ester moiety on the rhodamine B core, and its pharmacokinetic properties were found to be superior to those of the prototype ethyl ester. The goal of the present study was to optimize the rhodamine core while retaining the fluorodiethyleneglycol ester prosthetic group.A series of different rhodamine cores (rhodamine 6G, rhodamine 101, and tetramethylrhodamine) were labeled with 18F using the corresponding rhodamine lactones as the precursors and [18F]fluorodiethylene glycol ester as the prosthetic group. The compounds were purified by semipreparative HPLC, and their biodistribution was measured in rats. Additionally, the uptake of the compounds was evaluated in isolated rat cardiomyocytes.As was the case with the different prosthetic groups, we found that the rhodamine core has a significant effect on the in vitro and in vivo properties of this series of compounds. Of the rhodamines evaluated to date, the pharmacologic properties of the 18F-labeled diethylene glycol ester of rhodamine 6G are superior to those of the 18F-labeled diethylene glycol esters of rhodamine B, rhodamine 101, and tetramethylrhodamine. As with 18F-labeled rhodamine B, [18F]rhodamine 6G was observed to localize in the mitochondria of isolated rat cardiomyocytes.Based on these results, the 18F-labeled diethylene glycol ester of rhodamine 6G is the most promising potential PET MPI radiopharmaceutical of those that have evaluated to date, and we are now preparing to carry out first-in-human clinical studies with this compound.",

     "abstract": "The overall goal of these studies was to test the hypothesis that simultaneous down-regulation of a tumor survival gene and delivery of internally emitted cytotoxic radiation will be more effective than either treatment modality alone. The objectives were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a 177Lu-labeled anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate antisense conjugate in a mouse model bearing human non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) tumor xenografts and to optimize targeted antisense radiotherapy by dose fractionation.In the initial therapy studies, tumor-bearing mice were given saline, nonradioactive DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate, 177Lu-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate, 177Lu-DOTA-PNA-peptide alone, or 177Lu-DOTA-PNA-peptide followed by a chase dose of nonradioactive PNA-peptide. The MTD of 177Lu-DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate was then determined. Subsequently single dose MTD and four weekly fractionated doses were directly compared, followed by histopathologic evaluation.Antisense radiotherapy using 4.44\u00a0MBq of the 177Lu-DOTA-PNA-peptide followed by nonradioactive PNA-peptide was significantly more effective than other low dose treatment regimens. A dose of 18.5\u00a0MBq of 177Lu-DOTA-PNA-peptide was determined to be the approximate maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The median times to progression to a 1\u00a0cm3 tumor volume were 32 and 49\u00a0days for single dose MTD and fractionated dose (4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.63\u00a0MBq) groups, respectively. Histopathology revealed metastases in the single dose groups, but not in the dose fractionation group.Targeted antisense radiotherapy using 177Lu-DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate and DOTA-PNA-peptide conjugate effectively inhibited tumor progression in a mouse model of NHL. Furthermore, a dose fractionation regimen had a significant advantage over a single high dose, in terms of tumor growth inhibition and prevention of metastasis.Down-regulating bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic proto-oncogene, is a mechanism to reverse chemotherapy resistance or failure in humans with NHL. We have developed a 177Lu-DOTA-anti-bcl-2-PNA-Tyr3-octreotate conjugate for targeted antisense radiotherapy, in which down-regulation of bcl-2 and delivery of cytotoxic radiation occur simultaneously. Our previous studies have shown highly specific inhibition of bcl-2 protein, additive in vitro cytotoxic effects on human lymphoma cells, and favorable biodistribution and dosimetric properties. Lutetium-177 targeted antisense radiotherapy demonstrates a significant advantage over conventional 177Lu-peptide receptor radionuclide therapy in a mouse model of NHL. Our preclinical studies identified an effective combination of antisense and radionuclide therapy, with the goal of future clinical trials in patients.",

     "abstract": "The tricyclic indole compound, [18F]GE-180 has been previously identified as a promising positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agent of the translocator protein (TSPO) with the potential to aid in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy monitoring of degenerative neuroinflammatory conditions such as multiple sclerosis. [18F]GE-180 was first identified and evaluated as a racemate, but subsequent evaluations of the resolved enantiomers have shown that the S-enantiomer has a higher affinity for TSPO and an improved in vivo biodistribution performance, in terms of higher uptake in specific brain regions and good clearance (as described previously). Here we describe the additional biological evaluations carried out to confirm the improved performance of the S-enantiomer and including experiments which have demonstrated the stability of the chiral centre to chemical and biological factors.GE-180 and the corresponding radiolabelling precursor were separated into single enantiomers using semi-preparative chiral supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC). A detailed comparison of the individual enantiomers and the racemate was carried out in a number of biological studies. TSPO binding affinity was assessed using a radioligand binding assay. Incubation with rat hepatic S9 fractions was used to monitor metabolic stability. In vivo biodistribution studies up to 60\u00a0min post injection (PI) in na\u00efve rats were carried out to monitor uptake and clearance. Achiral and chiral in vivo metabolite detection methods were developed to assess the presence of metabolite/s in plasma and brain samples, with the chiral method also determining potential racemisation at the chiral centre.Evaluation of the chiral stability of the two enantiomers to metabolism by rat S9 fractions, showed no racemisation of enantiomers. There were notable differences in the biodistribution between the racemate and the R- and S-enantiomers. All compounds had similar initial brain uptake between 0.99 and 1.01% injected dose (id) at 2\u00a0min PI, with S-[18F]GE-180 showing significantly greater retention than the R-enantiomer at 10 and 30\u00a0min PI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). S-[18F]GE-180 uptake to the TSPO-expressing olfactory bulbs was 0.45% id (SD\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17) at 30\u00a0min PI in comparison to RS-[18F]GE-180 or R-[18F]GE-180 levels of 0.41% id \u00b1\u00a00.09 and 0.23% id \u00b1\u00a00.02 respectively, at the same timepoint (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The signal-to-noise ratio (ratio olfactory bulb to striata binding) were similar for both RS-[18F]GE-180 and S-[18F]GE-180 (3.2 and 3.4 respectively). Initial uptake to the lungs (an organ with high TSPO expression) was more than 3-fold greater with S-[18F]GE-180 than R-[18F]GE-180, and significantly higher at 10 and 30\u00a0min PI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore lung uptake of S-[18F]GE-180 at 2 and 10\u00a0min PI was also significant when compared to the racemate (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The majority of the radioactivity in the rat brain following administration of RS-[18F]GE-180 or S-[18F]GE-180 was due to the presence of the parent compound (91%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 and 94%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0 of total radioactivity at 60\u00a0min PI respectively). In contrast at 60\u00a0min PI for the plasma samples, the parent compounds accounted for only 28%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 and 21%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.6 of total radioactivity for RS-[18F]GE-180 and S-[18F]GE-180 respectively. Chiral assessment confirmed that the S-enantiomer was chirally stable in vivo, with no stereochemical conversion in brain and plasma samples up to 60\u00a0min PI.Developing racemic radiotracers, as for racemic therapeutics, is a considerable challenge due to differences of the enantiomers in pharmacokinetics, efficacy and potential toxicity. We have shown that the enantiomers of the promising racemic PET ligand [18F]GE-180 do not share identical performance, with S-[18F]GE-180 demonstrating higher TSPO affinity, higher brain uptake and better retention to the high TSPO-expressing lungs. Furthermore, S-[18F]GE-180 has also been shown to be enantiomerically stable in vivo, with no observed conversation of the eutomer to the distomer. As a single enantiomer, S-[18F]GE-180 retains the beneficial characteristics of the racemate and is a promising imaging agent for imaging neuroinflammation in vivo.",

The CBMN assay after labelling with ~\u00a0290\u00a0MBq of [18F]FDG showed radiation induced inhibition of proliferation capacity of the lymphocytes, confirmed by proliferation study.[18F]FDG labelling of mixed leukocytes causes severe radiation damage to the cell, higher than with [99mTc]HMPAO in accordance with the absorbed dose. Labelling of mixed leukocytes for clinical purpose induces high cytotoxicity reflected in the loss of proliferation capacity in lymphocytes this statement allows us to consider a low oncogenic risk however the association between MN formation in the PBL and subsequent risk of cancer is not well established.This is the first work about radiation damage with [18F]FDG labelled cells.

This result is illustrated in a patient showing an intense uptake in the mediastinum at initial staging of a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).An analytical relationship between TAU and the IF time constants is available in 18\u00a0F-FDG PET imaging, showing that TAU may actually affect the IF.",

Data from nine regions of interest were analyzed by several approaches, namely non-linear least-squared fitting methods with arterial input functions (one-tissue compartment model(1TCM), two-tissue compartment model (2TCM)), Logan plot, and linearized methods with reference region (Reference Logan plot (RefLogan), MRTM0, MRTM2). We also evaluated SUV and SUVR for both tracers.

Our results showed that both tracers can clearly distinguish between HC and AD groups although the pharmacokinetics and distribution patterns in brain for two tracers were substantially different.This study revealed that although the PET amyloid imaging agents [11C]BF227 and [18F]FACT have similar chemical and biological properties, they have different pharmacokinetics, and caution must be paid for usage of the tracers.",

The aim of this study was the optimization of the 44Sc production process at an accelerator, allowing its use for preclinical and clinical PET imaging.44CaCO3 targets were prepared and irradiated with protons (~\u00a011\u00a0MeV) at a beam current of 50\u00a0\u03bcA for 90\u00a0min. 44Sc was separated from its target material using DGA extraction resin and concentrated using SCX cation exchange resin. Radiolabeling experiments at activities up to 500\u00a0MBq and stability tests were performed with DOTANOC by investigating different scavengers, including gentisic acid. Dynamic PET of an AR42J tumor-bearing mouse was performed after injection of 44Sc-DOTANOC.The optimized chemical separation method yielded up to 2\u00a0GBq 44Sc of high radionuclidic purity. In the presence of gentisic acid, radiolabeling of 44Sc with DOTANOC was achieved with a radiochemical yield of ~\u00a099% at high specific activity (10\u00a0MBq/nmol) and quantities which would allow clinical application. The dynamic PET images visualized increasing uptake of 44Sc-DOTANOC into AR42J tumors and excretion of radioactivity through the kidneys of the investigated mouse.The concept \u201cfrom-bench-to-bedside\u201d was clearly demonstrated in this extended study using cyclotron-produced 44Sc. Sufficiently high activities of 44Sc of excellent radionuclidic purity are obtainable for clinical application, by irradiation of enriched calcium at a cyclotron.

NMDAr overexcitation is thought to be involved in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia. We synthesized [18F]-fluoroethylnormemantine ([18F]-FNM), a memantine derivative that binds to phencyclidine (PCP) sites within the NMDA channel pore. These sites are primarily accessible when the channel is in the active and open state.Radiosynthesis was carried out using the Raytest\u00ae SynChrom R&D fluorination module. Affinity of this new compound was determined by competition assay. We ran a kinetic study in rats and computed a time\u2013activity curve based on a volume-of-interest analysis, using CARIMAS\u00ae software. We performed an ex vivo autoradiography, exposing frozen rat brain sections to a phosphorscreen. Adjacent sections were used to detect NMDAr by immunohistochemistry with an anti-NR1 antibody. As a control of the specificity of our compound for NMDAr, we used a rat anesthetized with ketamine. Correlation analysis was performed with ImageJ software between signal of autoradiography and immunostaining.Fluorination yield was 10.5% (end of synthesis), with a mean activity of 3145\u00a0MBq and a specific activity above 355\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol. Affinity assessment allowed us to determine [19F]-FNM IC50 at 6.1 10\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M. [18F]-FMN concentration gradually increased in the brain, stabilizing at 40\u00a0minutes post injection. The brain-to-blood ratio was 6, and 0.4% of the injected dose was found in the brain. Combined ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemical staining demonstrated colocalization of NMDAr and [18F]-FNM (r\u00a0=\u00a00.622, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The highest intensity was found in the cortex and cerebellum, and the lowest in white matter.

We describe here the radiosynthesis of [18\u00a0F]AMG 580 and in vitro and in vivo characterization results.The potency and selectivity were determined by in vitro assay using [3H]AMG 580 and baboon brain tissues.

Data were analyzed using two tissue compartment analysis (2TC), Logan graphical (Logan) analysis with metabolite-corrected input function and the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) method. A PDE10A inhibitor and unlabeled AMG 580 were used to demonstrate the PDE10A specificity. KD was estimated by Scatchard analysis of high and low affinity PET scans.AMG 580 has an in vitro KD of 71.9 pM. Autoradiography showed specific uptake in striatum. Mean activity of 121\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018\u00a0MBq was used in PET studies.

A dose dependent decrease of BPND was observed by the pre-treatment with a PDE10A inhibitor. In baboons, 0.24\u00a0mg/kg dose of AMG 580 resulted in about 70% decrease of BPND. The in vivo KD of [18\u00a0F]AMG 580 was estimated to be around 0.44 nM in baboons.[18\u00a0F]AMG 580 is a selective and potent PDE10A PET tracer with excellent specific striatal binding in non-human primates.

We evaluated the potential of trans-1-amino-3-18F-fluorocyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-18F-FACBC) positron emission tomography (PET) to delineate the extent of diffuse gliomas by comparing PET findings with autoradiography, in vivo and ex vivo MRI, and histopathology findings.Dynamic PET was performed in rats with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea-induced glioma for 60\u00a0min after anti-18F-FACBC injection. Contrast-enhanced MRI was performed before or after PET. The PET images were fused with in vivo and ex vivo MR images, and histopathological images for direct comparisons. Autoradiograms were compared with the results of Evans Blue (EB) extravasation (to assess BBB integrity) and hematoxylin-eosin staining.Histopathological examination, including EB extravasation assessment, and enhanced T1-weighted MRI identified several diffuse gliomas with slight BBB disruption, similar to low-grade human gliomas. Anti-18F-FACBC uptake was specific and high in the gliomas, irrespective of BBB integrity. Higher anti-18F-FACBC uptake corresponded to areas of T2 hyperintensity, independent of gadolinium enhancement. Ex vivo autoradiography also showed high anti-18F-FACBC accumulation in tumors lacking EB extravasation and a correlation between anti-18F-FACBC accumulation and tumor cell density, but not EB extravasation.Anti-18F-FACBC-PET allowed visualization of gliomas irrespective of BBB integrity. The tumor-to-normal uptake ratio of anti-18F-FACBC generally correlated with the relative cell density. Anti-18F-FACBC PET combined with MRI shows promise for preoperative glioma delineation.Radiopharmaceuticals that cross the BBB, such as anti-18F-FACBC, are taken up by low-grade gliomas with equivocal MRI findings due to an intact BBB.Surgery is the first-line therapy for low-grade gliomas; therefore, delineation of their extent in the presence of an intact BBB is essential to planning surgery that removes the entire neoplasm, which will positively affect long-term survival.",

     "abstract": "Radioiodinated meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a norepinephrine transporter (NET) substrate, has been extensively used as an imaging agent to study the pathophysiology of the heart and for the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine tumors. The goal of this study was to develop an 18F-labeled analogue of MIBG that like MIBG itself could be synthesized in a single radiochemical step. Towards this end, we designed 4-fluoropropoxy-3-iodobenzylguanidine (FPOIBG).Standards of FPOIBG and 4-fluoropropoxy-3-bromobenzylguanidine (FPOBBG) as well as their tosylate precursors for labeling with 18F, and a tin precursor for the preparation of radioiodinated FPOIBG were synthesized. Radiolabeled derivatives were synthesized by nucleophilic substitution and electrophilic iododestannylation from the corresponding precursors. Labeled compounds were evaluated for NET transporter recognition in in vitro assays using three NET-expressing cell lines and in biodistribution experiments in normal mice, with all studies performed in a paired-label format. Competitive inhibition of [125I]MIBG uptake by unlabeled benzylguanidine compounds was performed in UVW-NAT cell line to determine IC50 values.[18F]FPOIBG was synthesized from the corresponding tosylate precursor in 5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5% (n\u00a0=\u00a06) overall radiochemical yields starting with aqueous fluoride in about 105\u00a0min. In a paired-label in vitro assay, the uptake of [18F]FPOIBG at 2\u00a0h was 10.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5%, 39.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4%, and 13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5%, in NET-expressing SK-N-SH, UVW-NAT, and SK-N-BE(2c) cells, respectively, while these values for [125I]MIBG were 57.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1%, 82.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.9%, and 66.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6%. The specificity of uptake of both tracers was demonstrated by blocking with desipramine. The 125I-labeled congener of FPOIBG gave similar results. On the other hand, [18F]FPOBBG, a compound recently reported in the literature, demonstrated much higher uptake, albeit less than that of co-incubated [125I]MIBG. IC50 values for FPOIBG were higher than those obtained for MIBG and FPOBBG. Unlike the case with [18F]FPOBBG, the heart uptake [18F]FPOIBG in normal mice was significantly lower than that of MIBG.Although [18F]FPOIBG does not appear to warrant further consideration as an 18F-labeled MIBG analogue, analogues wherein the iodine in it is replaced with a chlorine, fluorine or hydrogen might be worth pursuing.An 18F-labeled analogue of the well-known radiopharmaceutical MIBG could have significant impact, potentially improving imaging of NET related disease in cardiology and in the imaging of neuroendocrine tumors. Although 18F-labeled analogues of MIBG have been reported including LMI1195, we undertook this work hypothesizing that based on its greater structural similarity to MIBG, FPOIBG might be a better analogue than LMI1195.",

Carbon-11 is widely used in clinical PET studies due to the prevalence of facile techniques enabling the incorporation of [11C]CO2 and [11C]CH3 into molecules and a short half-life (20.4\u00a0min) that translates into low patient dose. However, the short half-life considerably limits the time for radiosynthesis. Furthermore, the majority of the syntheses of [11C]palmitic acid in common use employ high starting [11C]CO2 activities and/or expensive equipment.[11C]CO2 was trapped with greater than 99.99% efficiency by a three stage cartridge packed with molecular sieve 13X, 100\u2013120\u00a0mesh. The labeling of n-pentadecylmagnesium bromide took place in 5\u00a0min in the cartridge, and the [11C]palmitic acid product was selectively eluted in ethanol following alkaline and acidic washes of the column.The system reliably produced more than 925\u00a0MBq (25\u00a0mCi) of [11C]palmitic acid suitable for human use from 7.4\u00a0GBq (200\u00a0mCi) of [11C]CO2 in 8\u00a0min from end-of-bombardment.We have exploited the properties of the inexpensive molecular sieve 13X to develop a miniature, disposable and leak tight \u201cgas capture\u201d system for the rapid labeling and purification of [11C]fatty acids in good yield and >\u00a099% radiochemical purity.

Contrary to conventional human or murine antibodies consisting of IgG or F(ab\u2032)2 antibody fragments, VHH are able to effectively pass the blood brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. However, in earlier in vivo studies, anti-amyloid VHH showed poor BBB passage due to their short serum half-lives. It would be of interest to develop a VHH based protein with elongated serum half-life to enhance BBB passage, allowing the VHH to more easily reach the cerebral amyloid deposits.To increase serum persistence, the Fc portion of the human IgG1 antibody (hinge plus CH2 and CH3 domains) was fused to the C-terminus of the VHH (VHH-pa2H-Fc). To determine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution profile of the fusion protein, the chelator p-SCN-Bz-DTPA was linked to the protein and thereafter labeled with radioactive indium-111 (111In). Double transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 and wild type littermates were injected with 20\u00a0\u03bcg VHH-pa2H-Fc-DTPA-111In (10-20\u00a0MBq). Pharmacokinetics of the tracer was determined in blood samples at 10 intervals after injection and imaging using microSPECT was performed. The biodistribution of the radioactivity in various excised tissues was measured at 48\u00a0h after injection.We succeeded in the expression of the fusion protein VHH-pa2H-Fc in HEK293T cells with a yield of 50\u00a0mg/L growth medium. The fusion protein showed homodimerization \u2013 necessary for successful Fc neonatal receptor recycling. Compared to VHH-pa2H, the Fc tailed protein retained high affinity for amyloid beta on human AD patient brain tissue sections, and significantly improved serum retention of the VHH. However, at 48\u00a0h after systemic injection of the non-fused VHH-DTPA-111In and the VHH-Fc-DTPA-111In fusion protein in transgenic mice, the specific brain uptake of VHH-Fc-DTPA-111In was not improved compared to non-fused VHH-DTPA-111In.Using VHH-Fc conjugates increases the blood half-life of the protein. However, purely extending the time window for brain uptake does not increase BBB passage. Nevertheless, VHH-Fc holds promise for therapeutic applications where a sustained systemic circulation of VHH is advantageous.",

In line with this hypothesis, we are interested in the design and synthesis of C-7\u03b1-substituted estrogens as molecular probes to visualize ER function.We have synthesized 7\u03b1-(3-[18F]fluoropropyl) estradiol (C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES) as a potential radiopharmaceutical for ER imaging by positron emission tomography (PET). In vitro receptor binding and in vivo biodistribution and blocking studies in mature female mice, and in vivo metabolite analysis were carried out. Furthermore, in vivo ER-selective uptake was confirmed using ER-positive T-47D and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing mice. We also compared the in vivo biodistribution of C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES with 16\u03b1-[18F]FES.C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES was produced in moderate yields (30.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.1%, decay corrected) with specific activity of 32.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018.1\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol (EOS). The in vitro binding affinity of C3-7\u03b1-FES to the ER\u03b1 isoform was sufficient and equivalent to that of estradiol. C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES showed selective uptake in ER-rich tissues, such as the uterus (4.7%ID/g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2%ID/g at 15\u00a0minutes) and ovary (4.0%ID/g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0%ID/g at 5\u00a0minutes). The tissue time activity curves of these organs showed reversible kinetics, indicating suitability for quantitative analysis. The highest contrast was obtained at 120\u00a0minutes after injection of C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES in the uterus (uterus/blood\u00a0=\u00a018, uterus/muscle\u00a0=\u00a017.3) and ovary (ovary/blood\u00a0=\u00a06.3, ovary/muscle\u00a0=\u00a06.0). However, the level of selective uptake of C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES was significantly lower than that of 16\u03b1-[18F]FES. Most radioactivity in the uterus was detected in unchanged form, although peripherally C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES was rapidly degraded to hydrophilic metabolites. In accordance with this peripheral metabolism, gradual increases in bone radioactivity were observed, indicating defluorination. Coinjection with estradiol dose-dependently inhibited C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES uptake in the uterus and ovary. The in vivo IC50 values of estradiol in the uterus and ovary were 34.4 and 38.5\u00a0nmol/kg, respectively. Furthermore, in vivo tumor uptake of C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES was significantly higher (unpaired t test with Welch\u2019s correction; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) in ER-positive T-47D tumors (2.3%ID/g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4%ID/g) than ER-negative MDA-MB-231 tumors (0.9%ID/g\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1%ID/g).Although extensive metabolism was observed in rodents, C3-7\u03b1-[18F]FES showed promising results for quantitative analysis of ER density in vivo.

Both trans-1-amino-3-fluoro-1-14C-cyclobutanecarboxylic acid (anti-14C-FACBC) and 3H-methyl-l-methionine (3H-Met) uptake were quantified using triple-label accumulation assays to examine the relationship between tracer uptake and proliferation (3H-thymidine (TdR) accumulation) in vitro. U87 and U87R (TMZ-resistant subculture) cells were inoculated into the right and left basal ganglia, respectively, of F344/N-rnu rats. The efficacy of single-agent (TMZ, Bev) and combination therapy (TMZ/IFN, TMZ/Bev, TMZ/IFN/Bev) was examined in orthotopic gliomas using MRI, Evans blue extravasation, anti-14C-FACBC, and 3H-Met autoradiography, and MIB-1 immunostaining.TMZ treatment decreased 3H-TdR accumulation and the volume distribution of anti-14C-FACBC and 3H-Met in U87 but not U87R cells. TMZ/IFN combination therapy significantly decreased these parameters in U87R cells; however, Bev had no additional effect in vitro. In vivo, U87R-derived gliomas were observed as equivocal tumors on MRI and T2-high intensity lesions. Bev treatment, either alone or in combination, markedly decreased U87 enhancing lesions. By contrast, autoradiographic images using anti-14C-FACBC and 3H-Met clearly delineated tumor extent, which spread widely beyond T2-high intensity lesions and enhancing lesions. TMZ therapy significantly decreased tracer accumulation and proliferation of U87- but not U87R-derived tumors. TMZ/IFN combination treatment significantly decreased these parameters in U87R tumors, which were further reduced (in both tumor types) by Bev addition. Tracer uptake correlated with the MIB-1 proliferation index. However, MRI was unsuitable for tumor delineation and assessment of Bev treatment response.Triple-agent therapy (TMZ/IFN/Bev) was effective against even TMZ-resistant glioblastomas. PET with amino acid tracers provides useful information on the early response of glioblastomas to single-agent and combination therapy.",

Cell lysates from two NSCLC cell lines, H292 and H1975, were immunoblotted with anti-glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5) antibody for Western blotting. Thereafter, the two cell lines were used to examine cellular uptake of 99mTc-GLA with or without fructose. SPECT/CT imaging studies were performed on small animals bearing H292 and H1975 tumors. Biodistribution studies were also conducted to achieve accurate tissue uptake of this tracer in two tumor models. Hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining and GLUT5, Ki67 and cytokeratin-7 (CK-7) immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis were further investigated on tumor tissues. In Western blotting, H292 cells showed higher levels of GLUT5 compared to the H1975 cells. Meanwhile, the in vitro cell assays indicated GLUT5-dependent uptake of 99mTc-GLA in H292 and H1975 cells. The fructose competition assays showed a significant decrease in 99mTc-GLA uptake by H292 and H1975 cells when fructose was added. The 99mTc-GLA accumulation was as much as two-fold higher in H292 implanted tumors than in H1975 implanted tumors. 99mTc-GLA exhibited rapid clearance pharmacokinetics and reasonable uptake in human NSCLC H292 (1.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.37 ID%/g) and H1975 (0.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 ID%/g) implanted tumors at 30\u00a0min post injection. Finally, the expression of GLUT5, Ki67 and CK-7 on tumor tissues also exhibited positive correlation with the in vitro cell test results and in vivo SPECT/CT imaging results in xenograft tumors. Both in vitro and ex vivo studies demonstrated that the uptake of 99mTc-GLA in NSCLC is highly related to GLUT5 expression. Imaging and further IHC results support that 99mTc-GLA could be a promising SPECT imaging agent for NSCLC diagnosis and prognosis evaluation.",

     "abstract": "Targeted alpha therapy (TAT) has the potential for killing micro-metastases with minimum collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue. In-vivo generator radionuclides, such as223Ra, 225Ra, and 225Ac, are of special interest for radiotherapeutic applications as they emit multiple \u03b1-particles during their decay. Utilizing appropriate carriers capable of retaining both the parent radioisotope as well as daughter products is important for the effective delivery of the radioisotope to the tumor site while mitigating global in vivo radiotoxicity. In this work, LaPO4 core and core\u00a0+\u00a02 shells nanoparticles (NPs) (NPs with 2 layers of cold LaPO4 deposited on the core surfaces) were synthesized containing either 223Ra or225Ra/225Ac, and the retention of the parents and daughters within the NPs in vitro was investigated.Core LaPO4 NPs were synthesized in aqueous solution by reacting 1 equivalent of La(NO3)3, along with few microcuries of either 223Ra or 225Ra/225Ac, with 1 equivalent of sodium tripolyphosphate (TPP) under moderate heating and purified by membrane dialysis. Core-shell NPs were also synthesized with one (core\u00a0+\u00a01 shell) and two (core\u00a0+\u00a02 shells) cold LaPO4 layers deposited onto the radioactive cores. The NPs were then characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and powder x-ray diffraction (XRD). Identification and quantification of radioactive parents and daughters released from the NPs in vitro were investigated using gamma-ray spectroscopy.XRD and TEM analysis revealed that the NPs crystallized in the rhabdophane phase with mean diameters of 3.4 and 6.3\u00a0nm for core and core\u00a0+\u00a02 shells, respectively. The core LaPO4 NPs retained up to 88% of 223Ra over 35\u00a0days. However, in the core\u00a0+\u00a02 shells NPs, the retention of 223Ra and its daughter, 211Pb, was improved to >\u00a099.9% over 27\u00a0days. Additionally, the retention of 225Ra/225Ac parents was >\u00a099.98% and ~\u00a080% for the 221Fr and 213Bi daughters over 35\u00a0days for the core\u00a0+\u00a02 shells NPs.The in vitro retention of both parents and daughters results suggests that LaPO4 NPs are potentially effective carriers of radium isotopes.",

We examined the feasibility of adenovirus-mediated sodium iodide symporter (NIS) gene to cell tracking imaging of transplanted stem cells in a canine infarcted myocardium by clinical single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).Beagle dogs were injected intramyocardially with NIS-expressing adenovirus-transfected canine stem cells (Ad-hNIS-canine ADSCs) a week after myocardial infarction (MI) development. 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile (99mTc-MIBI) and 99mTc-pertechnetate (99mTcO4\u2212) SPECT imaging were performed for assessment of infarcted myocardium and viable stem cell tracking. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to monitor any functional cardiac changes.Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was decreased after LAD ligation. There was no significant difference in EF between the groups with the stem cell or saline injection. 125I uptake was higher in Ad-hNIS-canine ADSCs than in non-transfected ADSCs. Cell proliferation and differentiation were not affected by hNIS-carrying adenovirus transfection. 99mTc-MIBI myocardial SPECT imaging showed decreased radiotracer uptake in the infarcted apex and mid-anterolateral regions. Ad-hNIS-canine ADSCs were identified as a region of focally increased 99mTcO4\u2212 uptake at the lateral wall and around the apex of the left ventricle, peaked at 2 days and was observed until day 9.Combination of adenovirus-mediated NIS gene transfection and clinical nuclear imaging modalities enables to trace the fate of transplanted stem cells in infarcted myocardium for translational in vivo cell tracking study for prolonged duration.",

To shorten the preparation of [18\u00a0F]AV-133 and to make it more widely available, a simple and rapid purification method using solid-phase extraction (SPE) instead of high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was developed. The SPE method produced doses containing the non-radioactive pseudo-carrier 9-hydroxypropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (AV-149). The objectives of this study were to evaluate the brain uptake of AV-149 by UPLC-MS/MS and its effect on the biodistribution of [18\u00a0F]AV-133 in the brains of mice.The mice were injected with a bolus including [18\u00a0F]AV-133 and different doses of AV-149.

The effect of different amounts of AV-149 on [18\u00a0F]AV-133 was evaluated by quantifying the brain distribution of radiolabelled tracer [18\u00a0F]AV-133. The concentrations of AV-149 in the brain and plasma were analyzed using a UPLC-MS/MS method.The concentrations of AV-149 in the brain and plasma exhibited a good linear relationship with the doses. The receptor occupancy curve was fit, and the calculated ED50 value was 8.165\u00a0mg/kg. The brain biodistribution and regional selectivity of [18\u00a0F]AV-133 had no obvious differences at AV-149 doses lower than 0.1\u00a0mg/kg. With increasing doses of AV-149, the brain biodistribution of [18\u00a0F]AV-133 changed significantly.The results are important to further support that the improved radiolabelling procedure of [18\u00a0F]AV-133 using an SPE method may be suitable for routine clinical application.",

Consequently, fungal responses to densely-ionizing radiation, which can be harnessed to treat life-threatening fungal infections, remain incompletely understood.We addressed this issue by quantifying and comparing the effects of densely-ionizing \u03b1-particles (delivered either by external beam or by 213Bi-labeled monoclonal antibodies), and sparsely-ionizing 137Cs \u03b3-rays, on Cryptococus neoformans.The best-fit linear-quadratic parameters for clonogenic survival were the following: \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.24\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a02\u00a0Gy\u2212\u00a01 for \u03b3-rays and 1.07\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a02\u00a0Gy\u2212\u00a01 for external-beam \u03b1-particles, and \u03b2\u00a0=\u00a01.44\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a05\u00a0Gy\u2212\u00a02 for both radiation types. Fungal cell killing by radiolabeled antibodies was consistent with predictions based on the \u03b1-particle dose to the cell nucleus and the linear-quadratic parameters for external-beam \u03b1-particles. The estimated RBE (for \u03b1-particles vs. \u03b3-rays) at low doses was 4.47 for the initial portion of the \u03b1-particle track, and 7.66 for the Bragg peak. Non-radiological antibody effects accounted for up to 23% of cell death.These results quantify the degree of C. neoformans resistance to densely-ionizing radiations, and show how this resistance can be overcome with fungus-specific radiolabeled antibodies.",

     "abstract": "Due to its longer half-life, 44Sc (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a03.97 h) as a positron emitter can be an interesting alternative to 68Ga (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a067.71 min). It has been already proposed as a PET radionuclide for scouting bone disease and is already available as a 44Ti/44Sc generator. 44Sc has an isomeric state, 44mSc (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a058.6 h), which can be co-produced with 44Sc and that has been proved to be considered as an in-vivo PET generator 44mSc/44Sc. This work presents the production route of 44mSc/44Sc generator from 44Ca(d,2n), its extraction/purification process and the evaluation of its performances.Irradiation was performed in a low activity target station using a deuteron beam of 16 MeV, which favors the number of 44mSc atoms produced simultaneously to 44Sc. Typical irradiation conditions were 60 min at 0.2 \u03bcA producing 44 MBq of 44Sc with a 44Sc/44mSc activity ratio of 50 at end of irradiation. Separations of the radionuclides were performed by means of cation exchange chromatography using a DGA\u00ae resin (Triskem). Then, the developed process was applied with bigger targets, and could be used for preclinical studies.The extraction/purification process leads to a radionucleidic purity higher than 99.99% (43Sc, 46Sc, 48Sc\u00a0<\u00a0DL). 44mSc/44Sc labeling towards DOTA moiety was performed in order to get an evaluation of the specific activities that could be reached with regard to all metallic impurities from the resulting source. Reaction parameters of radiolabeling were optimized, reaching yields over 95%, and leading to a specific activity of about 10\u201320 MBq/nmol for DOTA. A recycling process for the enriched 44Ca target was developed and optimized.The quality of the final batch with regard to radionucleidic purity, specific activity and metal impurities allowed a right away use for further radiopharmaceutical evaluation. This radionucleidic pair of 44mSc/44Sc offers a quite interesting PET radionuclide for being further evaluated as an in-vivo generator.",

The inherent high electrical and thermal conductivity of this material, coupled with its high melting point, made it an ideal candidate for proton bombardment for production of 186Re.

In a previous study, although radioiodine-125-labeled 4-hydroxyphenyl-L-cysteine (125I-L-PC) was found to have good substrate affinity for tyrosinase enzyme in the melanin metabolic pathway, 123/131I-L-PC had insufficient substrate affinity for tyrosinase to diagnose melanoma. In this study, we synthesized 4-hydroxyphenylcysteamine (4-PCA) and developed a novel radioiodine-125-labeled 4-hydroxyphenylcysteamine (125I-PCA) to increase affinity for the melanin biosynthesis pathway.4-PCA was separated with 2-hydroxyphenylcysteamine (2-PCA), which is an isomer of 4-PCA, and was examined using melting point, proton nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. 125I-PCA was prepared using the chloramine-T method under no-carrier added conditions. We performed biodistribution experiments using B16 melanoma-bearing mice using 125I-PCA, 125I-L-PC, 125I-\u03b1-methyl-L-tyrosine, 123I-m-iodobenzylguanidine and 67Ga-citrate. In vitro assay was performed with B16 melanoma cells, and affinity for tyrosinase, DNA polymerase and amino acid transport was evaluated using phenylthiourea, thymidine, ouabine and L-tyrosine inhibitor. In addition, partition coefficients of 125I-PCA were evaluated.In the synthesis of 4-PCA, analysis values did not differ between calculated and reported values, and 4-PCA was separated from 2-PCA at high purity. In biodistribution experiments, 125I-PCA was accumulated and retained in B16 melanoma cells when compared with 125I-L-PC. 125I-PCA showed the highest values at 60\u00a0min after radiotracer injection in melanoma-to-muscle ratios, melanoma-to-blood ratios and melanoma-to-skin ratios. Accumulation of 125I-PCA was significantly inhibited by phenylthiourea and thymidine. Partition coefficients of 125I-PCA were lower than those of N-isopropyl-p-[123I]iodoamphetamine and were not significantly different from 125I-L-PC.125I-PCA is a better substrate for tyrosinase and DNA polymerase and has higher uptake and longer retention in B16 melanoma cells when compared with 125I-L-PC. Therefore, 123/131I-PCA has good potential for diagnosis for malignant melanoma.125I-PCA will be a specific diagnosis tool for malignant melanoma.123/131I-PCA has good potential for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma when compared with other SPECT tracers, as well as anti-melanoma chemotherapeutic drugs.",

How to systemically assess tumor HER2 expression and identifying appropriate use of anti-HER2 therapies by noninvasive imaging in vivo is an urgent issue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate SPECT imaging of 99mTc-Gly-(D)Ala-Gly-Gly-ZHER2:342 (99mTc-peptide-ZHER2:342) for monitoring therapeutic response to trastuzumab in nude mice bearing HER2-positive SKOV-3 xenografts.Nude mice bearing HER2-positive SKOV-3 xenografts were treated with trastuzumab (treatment group) or saline (control) with ten mice in each group. Mice in trastuzumab-treated group were given trastuzumab intraperiotoneally 4\u00a0mg/kg on day 1 and 2\u00a0mg/kg on day 8; Mice in control group were given physiological saline on day 1 and 8. Mice body weights and tumour volume were monitored every three days during treatment. In vivo SPECT imaging was performed in mice of the two groups using 99mTc-peptide-ZHER2:342 before treatment, on day 8 and 15 after treatment. Radiolabeled probe uptake in tumours was measured as the ratio of radioactive counts in the tumour to that in the contralateral equivalent region (T/NT). After SPECT imaging on day 15, all the mice were euthanized, biodistribution studies of the SKOV-3 xenografts were carried out to validate the imaging results and HER2 expression of the transplanted tumours was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Correlation analysis was performed between T/NT ratios acquired by in vivo SPECT imaging on day 15 and the HER2 level of tumours. In vitro cell binding capacity of 99mTc-ZHER2:342 with SKOV-3 cells in the absence and presence of varying amount of trastuzumab were also conducted in the study.Twenty mice body weight in the two groups gradually increased during treatment, but there was no statistical difference (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Though volumes of SKOV-3 xenografts gradually increased in each group during the treatment, the transplanted tumours in trastuzumab-treated group had a slower growth than those in control group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared with the baseline, the results of in vivo imaging showed that radionuclide accumulation in transplanted tumours reduced significantly in trastuzumab-treated group after treatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), whereas the tumour accumulation in control group increased after treatment. Biodistribution studies demonstrated that the results corresponded well with in vivo imaging data. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed the significant reduction in tumor HER2 level upon trastuzumab treatment, and there was an obviously positive correlation between T/NT ratios and HER2 level of tumours with correlation coefficient rs\u00a0=\u00a00.919, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05. There was no significant significance in cell binding ratios between varying amount of trastuzumab and the absence of trastuzumab (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).The early response to trastuzumab in mice bearing SKOV-3 xenografts was successfully monitored by SPECT imaging using 99mTc-peptide-ZHER2:342. This approach may be valuable in monitoring the therapeutic response in HER 2-positive tumours under HER2-targeted therapy.",

Using this fragment and the single-domain antibody EG2, which targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), we generated the novel multimeric antibody EG2-C4bp\u03b1. We radiolabeled EG2-C4bp\u03b1 with 99mTc and evaluated its targeting efficiency and pharmacokinetics in tumor xenografts.EGFR expression and EGFR-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 binding was evaluated in A431 and OCM-1 cells by Western blotting and flow cytometry, respectively. EG2-C4bp\u03b1 was radiolabeled with [99mTc(CO)3(OH2)3]+ using a tricarbonyl vial followed by purification on a PD-10 column. In vitro studies with 99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 were performed in A431 and/or OCM-1 cells. Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging and biodistribution studies were carried out in 99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1-injected mice bearing A431- and OCM-1-derived tumors. EGFR immunofluorescent staining in A431 and OCM-1 tumors was performed.A431 cells showed higher EGFR expression levels than OCM-1 cells, and flow cytometry confirmed EG2-C4bp\u03b1 bound more A431 cells than OCM-1 cells. 99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 was successfully prepared with radiochemical yields of 30.3\u201350.4%. The binding affinity of 99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 to A431 cells was approximately 20\u00a0nM. 99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 specifically bound A431 cells and this binding was blocked by 41% in the presence of 50\u00a0nM excess unlabeled EG2-C4bp\u03b1. In vivo radioactivity uptake in A431 tumors was detected 2\u00a0h after 99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 administration and sustained up to 18\u00a0h. The highest ratio of A431 tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-blood was 3.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48 at 10\u00a0h and 0.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14 at 20\u00a0h, respectively. Excess unlabeled EG2-C4bp\u03b1 blocked radioactivity uptake in A431 tumors by 55% at 10\u00a0h. 99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 was barely detectable in OCM-1 tumors, and biodistribution analysis confirmed that radioactivity uptake was significantly lower than in A431 tumors.99mTc-EG2-C4bp\u03b1 specifically and efficiently targets EGFR over-expressing tumors suggesting that EG2-C4bp\u03b1 may be a promising antibody alternative for future diagnostic application and potential radioimmunotherapy. However, the high activity in the blood and liver, and the relative low ratio of tumor-to-blood should be noticed and improved.",

     "abstract": "The myeloperoxidase inhibitor AZD3241 has been selected as a candidate drug currently being developed to delay progression in patients with neurodegenerative brain disorders. Part of the decision tree for translation of AZD3241 into clinical studies included the need for assessment of brain exposure in non-human primates by PET microdosing. For that purpose a rapid multistep method for 11C-labeling of AZD3241 was developed.AZD3241 was labeled in the thio-carbonyl position starting from [11C]potassium cyanide in a 4-step procedure using microwave assisted heating. In the first step [11C]potassium cyanide was converted to [11C]potassium thiocyanate followed by reaction with benzoyl chloride to yield benzoyl [11C]isothiocyanate. The benzoyl [11C]isothiocyanate was subsequently reacted with the precursor ethyl 3-(2-isopropoxyethylamino)-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylate and the formed intermediate underwent a base catalyzed cyclization to obtain [11C]AZD3241 in the final step.To assess [11C]AZD3241 brain exposure PET measurements were performed in three cynomolgus monkeys.[11C]AZD3241 was produced in good and reproducible radiochemical yield 710\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0294 MBq (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD, n\u00a0=\u00a07). Total time of synthesis was 60\u00a0min from end of bombardment. The specific radioactivity was 9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol and the radiochemical purity was >\u00a098%.Following iv administration of [11C]AZD3241 there was a rapid presence of radioactivity in brain in each of the three monkeys. The distribution of [11C]AZD3241 to brain was fast and a Cmax of 1.9 to 2.6% of the injected radioactivity was observed within 1.5\u00a0min. [11C]AZD3241 was homogeneously distributed in brain.The MPO inhibitor AZD3241 was successfully labeled with carbon-11 in a challenging 4-step procedure in good radiochemical yield allowing PET microdosing studies in cynomolgus monkey. [11C]AZD3241 rapidly entered brain and confirmed adequate brain exposure to support translation of AZD3241 to phase 2a studies in patients.",

     "abstract": "Steroid hormones like androgens play an important role in the development and maintenance of several brain functions. Androgens can act through androgen receptors (AR) in the brain. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of positron emission tomography (PET) with 16\u03b2-[18F]fluoro-5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone ([18F]FDHT) to image AR expression in the brain.Male Wistar rats were either orchiectomized to inhibit endogenous androgen production or underwent sham-surgery. Fifteen days after surgery, rats were subjected to a 90-min dynamic [18F]FDHT PET scan with arterial blood sampling. In a subset of orchiectomized rats, 1\u00a0mg/kg dihydrotestosterone was co-injected with the tracer in order to saturate the AR. Plasma samples were analyzed for the presence of radioactive metabolites by radio-TLC. Pharmacokinetic modeling was performed to quantify brain kinetics of the tracer. After the PET scan, the animals were terminated for ex-vivo biodistribution.PET imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies showed low [18F]FDHT uptake in all brain regions, except pituitary. [18F]FDHT uptake in the surrounding cranial bones was high and increased over time. [18F]FDHT was rapidly metabolized in rats. Metabolism was significantly faster in orchiectomized rats than in sham-orchiectomized rats. Quantitative analysis of PET data indicated substantial spill-over of activity from cranial bones into peripheral brain regions, which prevented further analysis of peripheral brain regions. Logan graphical analysis and kinetic modeling using 1- and 2-tissue compartment models showed reversible and homogenously distributed tracer uptake in central brain regions. [18F]FDHT uptake in the brain could not be blocked by endogenous androgens or administration of dihydrotestosterone.The results of this study indicate that imaging of AR availability in rat brain with [18F]FDHT PET is not feasible. The low AR expression in the brain, the rapid metabolism of [18F]FDHT in rats and the poor brain penetration of the tracer likely contributed to the poor performance of [18F]FDHT PET in this study.",

PET measurements were performed in rhesus monkeys including baseline and preblocking experiments with nicotine (0.24\u00a0mg/kg). Radiometabolites in plasma were measured using HPLC.[18F]-(-)-NCFHEB was prepared in a total synthesis time of 140\u00a0min.

In the monkey brain, radioactivity concentration was high in the thalamus, moderate in the putamen, hippocampus, frontal cortex, and lower in the cerebellum. Nicotine blocked 98-100% of [18F]-(-)-NCFHEB specific binding, and the non-displaceable distribution volume (VND) was estimated at 5.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.0\u00a0mL/cm3 (n\u00a0=\u00a02), or 6.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0mL/cm3 after normalization by the plasma free fraction fP. Imaging data are amenable to kinetic modeling analysis using the multilinear analysis (MA1) method, and model-derived binding parameters display good test-retest reproducibility.

PET examination in rhesus monkeys showed that [18F]-(-)-NCFHEB entered the brain readily and its regional radioactivity uptake pattern was in accordance with the known distribution of \u03b14\u03b22 receptors. Estimated non-displaceable binding potential (BPND) values in brain regions were better than those of [18F]2-FA and comparable to [18F]AZAN.

The aim of the present study was to optimize the radiochemical parameters for the preparation of [18F]FMISO using a microfluidic reaction system. The main parameters evaluated were (1) precursor concentration, (2) reaction temperature, and (3) flow rate through the microfluidic reactor. Optimized conditions were then applied to the batch production of [18F]FMISO for clinical research use.For the determination of optimal reaction conditions within a flow-through microreactor synthesizer, 5\u2013400\u00a0\u03bcL the precursor and dried [18F]fluoride solutions in acetonitrile were simultaneously pushed through the temperature-controlled reactor (60\u2013180\u00a0\u00b0C) with defined flow rates (20\u2013120\u00a0\u03bcL/min). Radiochemical incorporation yields to form the intermediate species were determined using radio-TLC.

The radioisotope 213Bi is a nuclide that has found substantial use for targeted \u03b1-therapy (TAT). The relatively unexplored aqueous chemistry of Bi3\u00a0+, however, hinders the development of bifunctional chelating agents that can successfully deliver these Bi radioisotopes to the tumor cells. Here, a novel series of nitrogen-rich macrocyclic ligands is explored for their potential use as Bi-selective chelating agents.The ligands, 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (Lpy), 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(3-pyridazylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (Lpyd), 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(4-pyrimidylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (Lpyr), and 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(2-pyrazinylmethyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane (Lpz), were prepared by a previously reported method and investigated here for their abilities to bind Bi radioisotopes. The commercially available and commonly used ligands 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and N-[(R)-2-amino-3-(p-isothiocyanato-phenyl)propyl]-trans-(S,S)- cyclohexane-1,2-diamine-N,N,N',N\",N\"-pentaacetic acid (CHX-A\u2032\u2032-DTPA) were also explored for comparative purposes. Radio-thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was used to measure the binding kinetics and stabilities of the complexes formed. The long-lived isotope, 207Bi (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a032\u00a0years), was used for these studies. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also employed to probe the ligand interactions with Bi3\u00a0+ and the generator parent ion Ac3\u00a0+.In contrast to DOTA and CHX-A\u2032\u2032-DTPA, these nitrogen-rich macrocycles selectively chelate Bi3\u00a0+ in the presence of the parent isotope Ac3\u00a0+. Among the four tested, Lpy was found to exhibit optimal Bi3\u00a0+-binding kinetics and complex stability. Lpy complexes Bi3\u00a0+ more rapidly than DOTA, yet the resulting complexes are of similar stability. DFT calculations corroborate the experimentally observed selectivity of these ligands for Bi3\u00a0+ over Ac3\u00a0+.Taken together, these data implicate Lpy as a valuable chelating agent for the delivery of 213Bi. Its selectivity for Bi3\u00a0+ and rapid and stable labeling properties warrant further investigation and biological studies.",

One relatively unexplored approach is to utilize prosthetic groups based on astatinated rhodium (III) complex stabilized with a tetrathioether macrocyclic ligand \u2013 Rh[16aneS4-diol]211At. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo stability of this complex in comparison to its iodine analog \u2013 Rh[16aneS4-diol]131I.Rh[16aneS4-diol]211At and Rh[16aneS4-diol]131I complexes were synthesized and purified by HPLC. The stability of both complexes was evaluated in vitro by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and human serum at different temperatures. The in vivo behavior of the two radiohalogenated complexes was assessed by a paired-label biodistribution study in normal Balb/c mice.Both complexes were synthesized in high yield and purity. Almost no degradation was observed for Rh[16aneS4-diol]131I in PBS over a 72\u00a0h incubation. The astatinated analog exhibited good stability in PBS over 14\u00a0h. A slow decline in the percentage of intact complex was observed for both tracers in human serum. In the biodistribution study, retention of 211At in most tissues was higher than that of 131I at all time points, especially in spleen and lungs. Renal clearance of Rh[16aneS4-diol]211At and Rh[16aneS4-diol]131I predominated, with 84.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3% and 94.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% of injected dose excreted via the urine at 4\u00a0h.The Rh[16aneS4-diol]211At complex might be useful for constructing prosthetic groups for the astatination of biomolecules and further studies are planned to evaluate this possibility.",

GRPR-specific uptake was found in receptor-positive normal tissues and PC-3 xenografts for all conjugates. The biodistribution of the conjugates was influenced by the choice of the chelator moiety. Although all radiotracers cleared rapidly from the blood, [68Ga]Ga-NOTA-PEG2-RM26 showed significantly lower uptake in lung, muscle and bone compared to the other analogs.

Variation in hydroxyapatite binding with various carrier concentrations seemed to be mainly driven by variation in radiochemical purity. The in-vivo bone accumulation appeared to be more complex: satisfactory radiochemical purity and hydroxyapatite affinity did not necessarily predict acceptable bio-distribution of 188Rhenium-HEDP.For development of new bisphosphonate-based radiopharmaceuticals for clinical use, human administration should not be performed without previous animal bio-distribution experiments. Furthermore, our clinical formulation of 188Rhenium-HEDP, containing 10\u00a0\u03bcmol carrier, showed excellent bone accumulation that was comparable to other bisphosphonate-based radiopharmaceuticals, with no apparent uptake in other organs.Radiochemical purity and in-vitro hydroxyapatite binding are not necessarily predictive of bone accumulation of 188Rhenium-HEDP in-vivo.The formulation for 188Rhenium-HEDP as developed by us for clinical use exhibits excellent bone uptake and variation in carrier concentration during preparation of this radiopharmaceutical should be avoided.",

Studies on another TdR analog, 4\u2032-thiothymidine (4DST), suggest that it might be a better PET-based proliferation tracer than either TdR or FLT. 4DST is resistant to the catabolism that complicates analysis of TdR in PET studies, but unlike FLT, 4DST is incorporated into DNA.To further evaluate 4DST, the kinetics of 4DST transport and metabolism were determined and compared to FLT and TdR. Transport and metabolism of FLT, TdR and 4DST were examined in the human adenocarcinoma cell line A549 under exponential-growth conditions. Single cell suspensions were incubated in buffer supplemented with radiolabeled tracer in the presence or absence of nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribonucleoside (NBMPR), an inhibitor of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). Kinetics of tracer uptake was determined in whole cells and tracer metabolism measured by high performance liquid chromatography of cell lysates.TdR and 4DST were qualitatively similar in terms of ENT-dependent transport, shapes of uptake curves, and relative levels of DNA incorporation. FLT did not incorporate into DNA, showed a significant temperature effect for uptake, and its transport had a significant NBMPR-resistant component. Overall 4DST metabolism was significantly slower than either TdR or FLT.4DST provides a good alternative for TdR in PET and has advantages over FLT in proliferation measurement. However, slow 4DST metabolism and the short half-life of the 11C label might limit widespread use in PET.",

Direct spread into the peritoneum is frequently found in pancreatic cancer patients, but positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) is not useful for identifying such metastasis. We investigated a method to enhance FDG accumulation using AsPC-1 human ascites tumor cells.14C-FDG accumulation was assessed under the following conditions: 1) characteristics of 14C-FDG transport were examined using phloridzin, a Na+-free buffer, and various hexoses, and 2) accumulation of 14C-FDG was measured in cells that were pretreated with hexose for various time periods, and activity of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1) was assayed.14C-FDG transport into AsPC-1 cells was mediated primarily by a Na+-independent transport mechanism. Aldohexoses such as d-glucose, d-mannose, and d-galactose inhibited 14C-FDG transport. Cells pretreated with d-glucose, d-mannose, or d-fructose exhibited augmented 14C-FDG accumulation. Pretreatment with higher concentrations of d-glucose or d-fructose tended to increase PFK-1 activity.Very little information has been published about the association between PFK-1 and FDG accumulation, and we confirmed the impacts of various hexoses on the activity of PFK-1 and FDG accumulation in AsPC-1 cells. Clarifying the relevance of PFK-1 in FDG accumulation will contribute to developing new features of FDG-PET, because PFK-1 is the main regulator of glycolysis.",

     "abstract": "The stress system provides integration of both neurochemical and somatic physiologic functions within organisms as an adaptive mechanism to changing environmental conditions throughout evolution. In mammals and primates the complexity and sophistication of these systems have surpassed other species in triaging neurochemical and physiologic signaling to maximize chances of survival. Corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and its related peptides and receptors have been identified over the last three decades and are fundamental molecular initiators of the stress response. They are crucial in the top down regulatory cascade over a myriad of neurochemical, neuroendocrine and sympathetic nervous system events. From neuroscience, we've seen that stress activation impacts behavior, endocrine and somatic physiology and influences neurochemical events that one can capture in real time with current imaging technologies. To delineate these effects one can demonstrate how the CRH neuronal networks infiltrate critical cognitive, emotive and autonomic regions of the central nervous system (CNS) with somatic effects. Abundant preclinical and clinical studies show inter-regulatory actions of CRH with multiple neurotransmitters/peptides. Stress, both acute and chronic has epigenetic effects which magnify genetic susceptibilities to alter neurochemistry; stress system activation can add critical variables in design and interpretation of basic and clinical neuroscience and related research. This review will attempt to provide an overview of the spectrum of known functions and speculative actions of CRH and stress responses in light of imaging technology and its interpretation. Metabolic and neuroreceptor positron emission/single photon tomography (PET/SPECT), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), anatomic MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (pMRS) are technologies that can delineate basic mechanisms of neurophysiology and pharmacology. Stress modulates the myriad of neurochemical and networks within and controlled through the central and peripheral nervous system and the effects of stress activation on imaging will be highlighted.",

The diagnostic performances of FCH and FEC for the detection of lymph node metastasis before the surgical approach are typically around 50% or less and between 0% and 39%, respectively. Conversely, both the tracers appear useful for the detection of recurrent PCa in case of increase in absolute PSA value or in case of high levels of PSA velocity and PSA doubling time (sensitivity ranged between 42.9% and 96% for FCH and between 62% and 85.7% for FEC).In according with the available information, FCH appears to be a more appropriate radiocompound as compared to FEC, although more comparative data are mandatory. A well designed and prospective trial for the evaluation of biokinetic data and diagnostic performance of both radiopharmaceutical agents seems essential.FCH seems to be an appropriate radiopharmaceutical agent as compared to FEC.

Assessment of tumor heterogeneity is increasingly used as a tool for prognostication prediction. We investigated the potential of SSTR-PET to assess intraindividual tumor heterogeneity and thereby treatment response prior to PRRT.12 patients with progressive radioiodine-refractory differentiated (1 papillary, 1 oxyphilic, 2 oncocytic, 4 follicular) or medullary (n\u00a0=\u00a04) TC were enrolled. SSTR-PET was performed at baseline. Conventional PET parameters and heterogeneity parameters were analyzed regarding their potential to predict progression-free (PFS, mean, 221\u00a0days) and overall survival (OS, mean, 450\u00a0days). Parameters of a subgroup of lesions (n\u00a0=\u00a023) were also correlated with morphological response according to modified RECIST criteria.In patient-based analysis, all conventional parameters failed to predict PFS. Several textural parameters showed a significant capability to assess PFS.

However, experiments determining the uptake of unbound 89Zr in disease models are not performed as routine controls. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the impact of free or weakly bound 89Zr on PET quantifications in disease models, in order to determine if such control experiments are warranted.Chemical studies were carried out to find a 89Zr compound that would solubilize the 89Zr as a weak chelate, thus mimicking free or weakly bound 89Zr released in circulation. 89Zr oxalate had the desired characteristics, and was injected into mice bearing FaDu and HT29 solid tumor xenografts, and mice infected in the lungs with the mold Aspergillus fumigatus, as well as in healthy controls (na\u00efve). PET/CT or PET/MR imaging followed to quantify the distribution of the radionuclide in the disease models.89Zr oxalate was found to have a plasma half-life of 5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3\u00a0h, accumulating mainly in the bones of all animals. Both tumor types accumulated 89Zr on the order of 2\u20104 %ID/cm3, which is comparable to EPR-mediated accumulation of certain species. In the aspergillosis model, the concentration of 89Zr in lung tissue of the na\u00efve animals was 6.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1 %ID/g. This was significantly different from that of the animals with advanced disease, showing 11.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8 %ID/g.Given the high levels of 89Zr accumulation in the disease sites in the present study, we recommend control experiments mapping the biodistribution of free 89Zr in any preclinical study employing 89Zr where bone uptake is observed. Aqueous 89Zr oxalate appears to be a suitable compound for such studies. This is especially relevant in studies where the tracer accumulation is based upon passive targeting, such as EPR.",

The renal uptake of 99mTc-RGD-Aoc-(Arg11)CCMSH and 99mTc-RGD-PEG2-(Arg11)CCMSH was 27.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.98 and 22.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.89% ID/g at 2\u00a0h post-injection. 99mTc-RGD-Aoc-(Arg11)CCMSH displayed higher tumor uptake than 99mTc-RGD-PEG2-(Arg11)CCMSH (2.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 vs. 1.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.25% ID/g at 2\u00a0h post-injection). The M21 human melanoma lesions could be clearly visualized by SPECT/CT using 99mTc-RGD-Aoc-(Arg11)CCMSH as an imaging probe.The favorable effect of Aoc and PEG2 linker in reducing the renal uptake provided a new insight into the design of novel dual receptor-targeting radiolabeled peptides.",

However, little attention has been focused on the biological profile of the host model and its potential effects on the bio-distribution and tumor targeting of the tracer compound under study. We specifically investigated the dissimilarity in bio-distribution of 111In-DTPA-5A10, which targets free prostate specific antigen (fPSA), in two animal models.In vivo bio-distribution studies of 111In-DTPA-5A10 were performed in immunodeficient BALB/c-nu or NMRI-nu mice with subcutaneous (s.c.) LNCaP tumors. Targeting-specificity of the tracer was assessed by quantifying the uptake in (a) mice with s.c. xenografts of PSA-negative DU145 cells as well as (b) BALB/c-nu or NMRI-nu mice co-injected with an excess of non-labeled 5A10. Finally, the effect of neonatal Fc-receptor (FcRn) inhibition on the bio-distribution of the conjugate was studied by saturating FcRn-binding capacity with nonspecific IgG1.The inherent biological attributes of the mouse model substantially influenced the bio-distribution and pharmacokinetics of 111In-DTPA-5A10. With LNCaP xenografts in BALB/c-nu mice (with intact B and NK cells but with deficient T cells) versus NMRI-nu mice (with intact B cells, increased NK cells and absent T cells), we observed a significantly higher hepatic accumulation (26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.9 versus 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4%IA/g respectively), and concomitantly lower tumor uptake (25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011 versus 52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010%IA/g respectively) in BALB/c-nu mice. Inhibiting FcRn by administration of nonspecific IgG1 just prior to 111In-DTPA-5A10 did not change tumor accumulation significantly.We demonstrated that the choice of immunodeficient mouse model importantly influence the bio-distribution of 111In-DTPA-5A10. This study further highlighted important considerations in the evaluation of preclinical tracers, with respect to gaining information on their performance in the translational setting. Investigators utilizing xenograft models need to assess not only radiolabeling strategies, but also the host immunological status.",

We previously found that apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe\u2212/\u2212) mice with the C57BL/6 (B6) background develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and accelerated atherosclerosis when fed a Western diet and that there are increased macrophage infiltrations in pancreatic islets and aorta. The formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) is abundantly expressed on the surface of macrophages. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the applicability of cinnamoyl-F-(D)L-F-(D)L-F (cFLFLF), a natural FPR1 antagonist, to detection of macrophages in the pancreatic islets and aorta. 64Cu labeled cFLFLF and 18\u00a0F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) were administered to mice with or without T2DM. Diabetic mice showed an increased 18FDG uptake in the subcutaneous fat compared with control mice, but pancreatic uptake was minimal for either group. In contrast, diabetic mice exhibited visually noticeable more cFLFLF-64Cu retention in pancreas and liver than control mice. The heart and pancreas isolated from diabetic mice contained more macrophages and showed stronger PET signals than those of control mice. Flow cytometry analysis revealed the presence of macrophages but not neutrophils in pancreatic islets. Real-time PCR analysis revealed much higher FPR1 expression in pancreatic islets of diabetic over control mice. Autoradiography and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed abundant FPR1 expression in atherosclerotic lesions. Thus, 64Cu-labeled cFLFLF peptide is a more effective PET agent for detecting macrophages compared to FDG.",

They play a major role in the development of therapies for age-related pathologies such as Parkinson's disease. To validate the usefulness of these animal models in aging or age-related disease research, the consistency of cerebral aging processes across species must be evaluated. The dopaminergic system seems particularly susceptible to the aging process. One of the results of this susceptibility is a decline in striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) availability.We sought to ascertain whether similar age changes could be detected in-vivo in rats, using molecular imaging techniques such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with [123I]FP-CIT.A significant decrease of 17.21% in the striatal specific uptake ratio was observed in the aged rats with respect to the young control group.Our findings suggest that age-related degeneration in the nigrostriatal track is similar in humans and rats, which supports the use of this animal in models to evaluate the effect of aging on the dopaminergic system.Our findings indicate that age-related degeneration in the nigrostriatal track is similar in humans and rats and that these changes can be monitored in vivo using small animal SPECT with [123I]FP-CIT, which could facilitate the translational research in rat models of age related disorders of dopaminergic system.",

For C6 xenografts low target-to-nontarget ratio and high non-specific binding did not allow clear tumor visualization. No accumulation was visible in EMT6 tumor or in PC-3 tumor. Rat and mouse brain uptake was low and homogeneous while stronger signal was detected in the spinal cord.

Pharmacokinetic, imaging, and radiotherapy studies were performed in PC-3 xenografted mice.The Kd value of 177Lu-DOTA-gluBBN was 0.63 nM, with a maximum binding capacity (Bmax) of 669.7 fmol/106 cells (4.04\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 GRPR/cell).

     "abstract": "Hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation, which is accompanied by increased expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23, is an important factor in liver fibrogenesis. Molecular imaging targeting the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 could provide a non-invasive method for evaluating the expression and the function of the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 on the activated HSCs (aHSCs) in the injured liver, and then provide important prognostic information. 99mTc-3PRGD2 is such a radiotracer specific for integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. In this study, we aimed to compare the differences in liver uptake and retention of the 99mTc-3PRGD2 between normal liver and injured liver to evaluate the feasibility of 99mTc-3PRGD2 scintigraphy for this purpose.We used planar scintigraphy to assess changes in integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 binding of intravenously-administered 99mTc-3PRGD2 in the livers of rats with thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver fibrosis compared with the controls. We co-injected cold c(RGDyK) with 99mTc-3PRGD2 to assess the specific binding of the radiotracer. We performed Sirius red staining to assess liver fibrosis, immunofluorescent colocalization to identify the location of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expressed in the fibrotic liver, and we measured protein and messenger RNA expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) in the control and fibrotic livers.The fibrotic livers showed enhanced 99mTc-3PRGD2 uptake and retention. The radiotracer was demonstrated to bind specifically with the integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 mainly expressed on the aHSCs. The liver-to-heart ratio at 30\u00a0min post-injection was higher in the fibrotic livers than in the control livers (TAA, 1.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08 vs. control, 1.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The liver t1/2 was longer than in the controls (TAA, 27.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.69\u00a0min vs. control, 12.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.10\u00a0min, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The difference of heart t1/2 between the two groups was not statistically significant (TAA, 3.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63\u00a0min vs. control, 3.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0min, p\u00a0=\u00a00.94).99mTc-3PRGD2 molecular imaging can provide a non-invasive method for assessing activation of HSCs.",

     "abstract": "TMTP1 (NVVRQ) is a novel tumor-homing peptide, which specifically targets tumor metastases, even at the early stage of occult metastasis foci. Fusing TMTP1 to therapeutic peptides or proteins can increase its anti-cancer efficacy both in vivo and in vitro. Here, we labeled TMTP1 with 99mTc to evaluate its targeting properties in an ovarian cancer xenograft tumor mouse model and a gastric cancer xenograft mouse model.The invasion ability of SKOV3 and highly metastatic SKOV3.ip cell lines were performed by the Transwell Invasion Assays, and then Rhodamine-TMTP1 was used to detect its affinity to these two cells. Using the co-ligand ethylenediamine-N, N\u2032-diacetic acid (EDDA) and the bifunctional chelator 6-hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC), the TMTP1 peptide was labeled with 99mTc. A cell-binding assay was performed by incubating cancer cells with 99mTc-HYNIC-TMTP1 with or without an excess dose of cold HYNIC-TMTP1. To evaluate the probe in vivo, nude mice bearing SKOV3, SKOV3.ip and MNK-45 tumor cells were established and subjected to SPECT imaging after injection with 99mTc-HYNIC-TMTP1. Ex vivo \u03b3-counting of dissected tissues from the mice was used to evaluate its biodistribution.99mTc-HYNIC-TMTP1 was successfully synthesized. The radiotracer also exhibited high hydrophilicity and excellent stability in vitro and in vivo. It has strong affinity to highly metastatic cancer cell lines but not to poorly metastatic cell lines. After mice were injected with 99mTc-HYNIC-TMTP1, non-invasive SPECT imaging detected SKOV3.ip and MNK-45 xenograft tumors but not SKOV3 xenograft tumors. This result can be inhibited by excess HYNIC-TMTP1. The uptake of 99mTc-HYNIC-TMTP1 in SKOV3.ip xenograft tumors was 0.182\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.017% ID/g at 2\u00a0h p.i. with high renal uptake (74.32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015.05% ID/g at 2\u00a0h p.i.).99mTc-HYNIC-TMTP1 biodistribution and SPECT imaging demonstrated its ability to target highly metastatic tumors. Therefore, metastasis can be non-invasively investigated by SPECT imaging using 99mTc-HYNIC-TMTP1. Meanwhile, this radiotracer has some shortages in the low % ID/g of tumors and high accumulation in the kidney.",

     "abstract": "In the present investigation, microarray analysis was used to monitor transcriptional activity in thyroids in mice 24\u00a0h after 131I exposure. The aims of this study were to 1) assess the transcriptional patterns associated with 131I exposure in normal mouse thyroid tissue and 2) propose biomarkers for 131I exposure of the thyroid.Adult BALB/c nude mice were i.v. injected with 13, 130 or 260\u00a0kBq of 131I and killed 24\u00a0h after injection (absorbed dose to thyroid: 0.85, 8.5, or 17\u00a0Gy). Mock-treated mice were used as controls. Total RNA was extracted from thyroids and processed using the Illumina platform.In total, 497, 546, and 90 transcripts were regulated (fold change \u2265\u00a01.5) in the thyroid after 0.85, 8.5, and 17\u00a0Gy, respectively. These were involved in several biological functions, e.g. oxygen access, inflammation and immune response, and apoptosis/anti-apoptosis. Approximately 50% of the involved transcripts at each absorbed dose level were dose-specific, and 18 transcripts were commonly detected at all absorbed dose levels. The Agpat9, Plau, Prf1, and S100a8 gene expression displayed a monotone decrease in regulation with absorbed dose, and further studies need to be performed to evaluate if they may be useful as dose-related biomarkers for 131I exposure.Distinct and substantial differences in gene expression and affected biological functions were detected at the different absorbed dose levels. The transcriptional profiles were specific for the different absorbed dose levels. We propose that the Agpat9, Plau, Prf1, and S100a8 genes might be novel potential absorbed dose-related biomarkers to 131I exposure of thyroid.During the recent years, genomic techniques have been developed; however, they have not been fully utilized in nuclear medicine and radiation biology. We have used RNA microarrays to investigate genome-wide transcriptional regulations in thyroid tissue in mice after low, intermediate, and high absorbed doses from 131I exposure in vivo. Using this approach, we have identified novel biological responses and potential absorbed dose-related biomarkers to 131I exposure. Our research shows the importance of embracing technological advances and multi-disciplinary collaboration in order to apply them in radiation therapy, nuclear medicine, and radiation biology.This work may contribute with new knowledge of potential normal tissue effects or complications that may occur after exposure to ionizing radiation in diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine, and due to radioactive fallout or accident with radionuclide spread.",

     "abstract": "In previous work, we demonstrated the presence of hydroxyapetite (type II microcalcification), HAP, in triple negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We used 18F-NaF to detect these types of cancers in mouse models as the free fluorine, 18F\u2212, binds to HAP similar to bone uptake. In this work, we investigate other bone targeting agents and techniques including 99mTc-MDP SPECT and Osteosense 750EX FMT imaging as alternatives for breast cancer diagnosis via targeting HAP within the tumor microenvironment.Thirteen mice were injected subcutaneously in the right flank with 106 MDA-MB-231 cells. When the tumor size reached ~\u00a00.6\u00a0cm3, mice (n\u00a0=\u00a09) were injected with ~\u00a037\u00a0MBq of 99mTc-MDP intravenously and then imaged one hour later in a NanoSPECT/CT or injected intravenously with 4\u00a0nmol/g of Osetosense 750EX and imaged 24\u00a0hours later in an FMT (n\u00a0=\u00a04). The imaging probe concentration in the tumor was compared to that of muscle. Following SPECT imaging, the tumors were harvested, sectioned into 10\u00a0\u03bcm slices, and underwent autoradiography or von Kossa staining to correlate 99mTc-MDP binding with HAP distribution within the tumor. The SPECT images were normalized to the injected dose and regions-of-interest (ROIs) were drawn around bone, tumor, and muscle to obtain the radiotracer concentration in these regions in units of percent injected dose per unit volume. ROIs were drawn around bone and tumor in the FMT images as no FMT signal was observed in normal muscle.Uptake of 99mTc-MDP was observed in the bone and tumor with little or no uptake in the muscle with concentrations of 11.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.46 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD), 2.22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.95, and 0.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0%ID/cc, respectively. Uptake of Osteosense 750EX was also observed in the bone and tumor with concentrations of 0.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07 (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD) and 0.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0picomoles, respectively. No FMT signal was observed in the normal muscle. There was no significant difference in the bone-to-tumor ratio between the two modalities (5.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3 for SPECT and 8.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 for FMT) indicating that there is little difference in tumor uptake between these two agents.This study provides evidence of the accessibility of HAP within the breast tumor microenvironment as an in vivo imaging target for bone-seeking agents. SPECT imaging using 99mTc-MDP can be rapidly translated to the clinic. FMT imaging using Osteosense 750EX is not currently approved for clinical use and is limited to animal research.",

We have established E3S as a potential ligand for targeting hormone dependent breast cancer cells, and in this study sought to prepare and investigate radioiodinated E3S as a tool to study the OATP system.2- and 4-Iodoestrone-3-sulfates were prepared from estrone via aromatic iodination followed by a rapid and high yielding sulfation procedure. The resulting isomers were separated by preparative HPLC and verified by 1H NMR and analytical HPLC. Transport studies of 2- and 4-[125I]-E3S were conducted in hormone dependent (i.e. MCF-7) and hormone independent (i.e. MDA-MB-231) breast cancer cells in the presence or absence of the specific transport inhibitor, bromosulfophthalein (BSP). Cellular localization of OATP1A2, OATP2B1, OATP3A1 and OATP4A1 were determined by immunofluorescence analysis using anti-Na+/K+ ATPase-\u03b1 (1:100 dilution) and DAPI as plasma membrane and nuclear markers, respectively.Significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) higher total accumulation of 2-[125I]-E3S was observed in hormone dependent MCF-7 as compared to hormone independent MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In contrast 4-[125I]-E3S did not show cellular accumulation in either case. The efficiency of 2-[125I]-E3S transport (expressed as a ratio of Vmax/Km) was 2.4 times greater in the MCF-7 as compared to the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. OATP1A2, OATP3A1 and OATP4A1 expression was localized in plasma membranes of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells confirming the functional role of these transporters in radioiodinated E3S cellular uptake.An efficient method for the preparation of 2- and 4-[125I]-E3S was developed and where the former demonstrated potential as an in vitro probe for the OATP system. The new E3S probe can be used to study the OATP system and as a platform to create radiopharmaceuticals for imaging breast cancer.",

In this study, we labeled Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA with different 18\u00a0F-prosthetic groups and characterized their uptake in A549 cells infected with influenza A virus from the 2009 pandemic (H1N1pdm).DPA was labeled with N-succinimidyl 4-18\u00a0F-fluorobenzoate (18\u00a0F-SFB), 4-nitrophenyl 2-18\u00a0F-fluoropropionate (18\u00a0F-NFP), 2-18\u00a0F-Fluoroethyl toslyate (18\u00a0F-FET), and 18\u00a0F-aluminum (Al18F), respectively. Cy7-DPA was labeled with 18\u00a0F-SFB and 18\u00a0F-NFP only. The tracers were reconstituted with zinc nitrate before use. Apoptosis in A549 cells was induced by infection with the H1N1pdm virus for 48\u00a0h. Three \u03bcCi of each tracer was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The effect of different prosthetic groups, different MOI, and incubation time on percent cellular uptake was studied. Cell internalization and efflux was evaluated within 2\u00a0h of incubation. The competitive binding assay was performed with increasing concentration (10\u2212\u00a012-10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0M) of Zn-DPA or Cy7-Zn-DPA prior to the addition of either 18\u00a0F-FB-Zn-DPA or 18\u00a0F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA into each well. IC50 values for the two Zn-DPA analogues were estimated by GraphPad Prism 6.0.Among all the four prosthetic groups, the 18\u00a0F-SFB method provided the highest conjugation yield for DPA and the highest uptake ratio between the infection cells and the control when both Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA were present in the complex. The uptake ratio was similar for 18\u00a0F-FB-Zn-DPA and 18\u00a0F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA. Uptake of 18\u00a0F-FB-Zn-DPA and 18\u00a0F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA was proportional to the degree of apoptosis with a plateau at MOI 3. Uptake of 18\u00a0F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA also increased over incubation time and reached a plateau at 1\u00a0h, whereas uptake of 18\u00a0F-FB-Zn-DPA did not show any significant change over time. Cell internalization studies showed that more than 70% of 18\u00a0F-FB-Zn-DPA remained on the cell surface over a time course of 2\u00a0hr in the cell media, but over 90% of 18\u00a0F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA was internalized within 15\u00a0min of incubation. IC50 values were estimated to be 1.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 nM and 26.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1 nM for Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA, respectively.18\u00a0F-SFB was the optimal labeling method for Zn-DPA and Cy7-Zn-DPA with respect to radiochemistry and provided complexes with high target-to-background ratios. 18\u00a0F-FB-Zn-DPA and 18\u00a0F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA appeared to have a completely different internalization mechanism, while Zn-DPA showed higher binding affinity than Cy7-Zn-DPA. Based on these favorable characteristics, 18\u00a0F-FB-Zn-DPA and 18\u00a0F-FB-Cy7-Zn-DPA should be further evaluated as potential imaging agents for viral infection.",

In this study, aptamers selected to Staphylococcus aureus were evaluated for bacterial infection identification.Anti S. aureus aptamers were labeled with 99mTc by the direct method. The radiolabel yield and complex stability were assessed by thin-layer chromatography (TLC). Three groups of Swiss mice containing 6 animals each were used. The first group was infected intramuscularly in the right thigh with S. aureus. The second group was infected in the same way with C. albicans and the third group was injected with zymosan to induce aseptic inflammation. After 24\u00a0h, radiolabeled aptamers (22.2\u00a0MBq) were injected by the tail vein. The mice were euthanized 4\u00a0h post injection and tissue sample activities measured in a gamma counter.The 99mTc labeled aptamers were stable in saline, plasma and cystein excess. Radiolabeled aptamers showed increased uptake in the kidneys for all groups indicating a main renal excretion, which is consistent with the hydrophilic nature and small size of aptamers. The radiopharmaceutical showed rapid blood clearance indicated by a reduced dose (% ID/g) in the blood. The biodistribution showed that aptamers were able to identify the infection foci caused by S. aureus displaying a target/non-target ratio of 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5. This ratio for mice infected with C. albicans was 2.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.4 while for mice with aseptic inflammation was 1.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2. Histology confirmed the presence of infection in groups 1 and 2, and inflammation in group 3.The biodistibution study demonstrated a statistically higher uptake in the S. aureus foci relative to inflammation and C. albicans infected areas.

     "abstract": "Previously, we reported a probe for imaging of atherosclerotic plaques: 111In-labeled liposomes. Liposomes were modified with phosphatidylserine (PS) because macrophages recognize PS and phagocytize apoptotic cells in plaques. PS modification was successful and we could visualize atherosclerotic plaques by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, too-rapid blood clearance reduced accumulation of PS-liposomes in plaques in vivo. Therefore, in the present study, PS-liposomes were modified with polyethylene glycol (PEG) to retard the rate of blood clearance.PS-liposomes (size, 100\u00a0nm or 200\u00a0nm) were PEGylated with PEG2000 or PEG5000 at 1 or 5\u00a0mol%, and radiolabeled with 111In. For the study of uptake in vitro, liposomes were incubated with mouse peritoneal macrophages. Biodistribution studies in vivo were carried out in ddY mice. En face autoradiograms were obtained with apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice upon intravenous injection of 111In-liposomes.Uptake was decreased significantly at 5\u00a0mol% PEGylation in 100-nm PS-liposomes (*P\u00a0<\u00a00.05 vs. 0\u00a0mol%). All the PEGylated liposomes tested showed significantly lower uptake than the non-PEGylated control in 200-nm liposomes. In vivo results showed slower blood clearance in PEGylated liposomes. Autoradiograms in apoE\u2212/\u2212 mice were well matched with Oil Red O staining. Additionally, 200-nm PS-liposomes modified with 5%PEG2000 ([111In]5%PEG2000PS200) showed the highest uptake to the region in vivo.As expected, PEGylation retarded the rate of blood clearance. In addition, it affected liposome uptake by macrophages in vitro. These results suggest that the balance between the rate of blood clearance and macrophage recognition is important, and [111In]5%PEG2000PS200 showed the best results in our investigation.",

Volume of distribution (VT) estimated with an arterial plasma input function is the gold standard for quantitation of [11C]PBR28 binding. However, arterial sampling is impractical at many PET sites for multiple reasons. Reference region modeling approaches are not ideal for TSPO tracers, as the existence of a true reference region cannot be assumed. Given that it would be desirable to have a non-invasive index of [11C]PBR28 binding, we elected to study the utility of the semi-quantitative metric, standardized uptake value (SUV) for use in brain [11C]PBR PET studies. The primary goal of this study was to determine the relationship between SUV and VT.We performed a retrospective analysis of data from sixteen [11C]PBR28 PET scans acquired in baboons at baseline and at multiple time points after IV injection of lipopolysaccharide, an endotoxin that transiently induces neuroinflammation. For each scan, data from 14 brain regions of interest were studied. VT was estimated with the Logan plot, using metabolite-corrected input functions. SUV was calculated with data from 30 to 60\u00a0minutes after [11C]PBR28 injection.Within individual PET studies, SUV tended to correlate well with VT. Across studies, the relationship between SUV and VT was variable.From study to study, there was variability in the degree of correlation between [11C]PBR28 VT and SUV. There are multiple physiological factors that may contribute to this variance.As currently applied, the non-invasive measurement of SUV does not appear to be a reliable outcome variable for [11C]PBR28. Additional work is needed to discover the source of the discrepancy in SUV between [11C]PBR28 scans.There is a need to develop alternatives to arterial plasma input functions for TSPO ligands in order to facilitate multi-center trials.",

Thus, development of radioligands for the TSPO may contribute to further understanding the in vivo TSPO function in central and peripheral inflammatory processes and other pathologies. Here, we report the biodistribution, the specific binding and the radiometabolites of [18F]DPA-714, a promising fluorinated PET radiotracer, in normal mice using a microPET/CT scanner.The in vivo biodistribution and kinetics of [18F]DPA-714 were measured in mice brain and peripheral tissues. Specific binding to TSPO sites was assessed using pharmacological competitive studies by means of saturation experiments performed by i.v. injection of 1\u00a0mg/kg of unlabeled DPA-714 or 3\u00a0mg/kg of unlabeled PK11195. A region of interest analysis was performed to generate time-activity curves in the brain, heart, lung, kidney, spleen and liver. Metabolites assay was performed in the plasma and peripheral organs by radio-HPLC.[18F]DPA-714 reached high concentration in lung, heart, kidney and spleen, tissues well known to be rich in TSPO sites. [18F]DPA-714 kinetics were faster in the lung and slower in the kidney. Pre-injection of unlabeled DPA-714 or PK11195 inhibited about 80% of [18F]DPA-714 uptake in the lung and heart (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0005). The percentage of inhibition in the kidney was lower and achieved at later times only with DPA-714 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) but not with PK11195. Sixty minutes after radiotracer injection only unmetabolized radioligand was found in the brain, lung, heart and spleen.These results suggest that [18F]DPA-714 is a suitable PET ligand for imaging in mice brain and peripheral tissues since it binds with high specificity TSPO binding sites and it is almost unchanged at 60\u00a0minutes after radiotracer injection in the brain and TSPO-rich regions.",

AHDD was formulated into a kit and was labeled with 188Re. Biodistribution study was performed using normal BALB/c mice.The kit was labeled with 188Re with a high efficiency (98.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2%). After extraction with lipiodol, the overall yield of 188Re-HDD/lipiodol was as high as 90.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6%. A comparative biodistribution study of 188Re-HTDD and 188Re-HDD was performed in normal mice after intravenous injection. The lungs were identified as the main uptake site due to capillary-blockage. 188Re-HDD/lipiodol showed a significantly higher lung uptake than that of 188Re-HTDD/lipiodol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The newly synthesized 188Re-HDD/lipiodol showed improved radiolabeling yield and biodistribution results compared to 188Re-HTDD/lipiodol, and may therefore be more suitable for liver cancer therapy.",

More than 90% of pancreatic cancers are EGFR-positive.F(ab')2 fragments were produced by proteolytic digestion of panitumumab IgG or non-specific human IgG, purified by ultrafiltration then modified with NOTA chelators for complexing 64Cu. Panitumumab IgG and Fab fragments were similarly labeled with 64Cu. EGFR immunoreactivity was determined in competition and direct (saturation) cell binding assays. The biodistribution of 64Cu-labeled panitumumab IgG, F(ab')2 and Fab was compared in non-tumor-bearing Balb/c mice. MicroPET/CT and biodistribution studies were performed in NOD-scid mice engrafted subcutaneously (s.c.) or orthotopically with patient-derived OCIP23 pancreatic tumors, or in NOD-scid with s.c. PANC-1 human pancreatic cancer xenografts.Panitumumab F(ab')2 fragments were produced in high purity (>\u00a090%), derivitized with 3.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 NOTA/F(ab')2, and labeled with 64Cu (0.3\u20133.6\u00a0MBq/\u03bcg). The binding of 64Cu-NOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 to OCIP23 or PANC-1 cells was decreased significantly by an excess of panitumumab IgG. The Kd for binding of 64Cu-NOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 to EGFR on PANC-1 cells was 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0nmol/L. F(ab')2 fragments exhibited more suitable normal tissue distribution for tumor imaging with 64Cu than panitumumab IgG or Fab. Tumor uptake at 48\u00a0h post injection (p.i.) of 64Cu-NOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2 was 12.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% injected dose/g (ID/g) in s.c. and 11.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9% ID/g in orthotopic OCIP23 tumors vs. 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1% ID/g in s.c. PANC-1 xenografts. Tumor/Blood (T/B) ratios were 5:1 to 9:1 for OCIP23 and 2.4:1 for PANC-1 tumors. Tumor uptake of 64Cu-NOTA-non-specific F(ab')2 in OCIP23 xenografts was 5-fold lower than 64Cu-panitumumab F(ab')2. All tumor xenografts were clearly imaged by microPET/CT at 24 or 48\u00a0h p.i. of 64Cu-NOTA-panitumumab F(ab')2.64Cu-panitumumab F(ab')2 fragments bound with high affinity to EGFR on pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and localized specifically in patient-derived pancreatic cancer xenografts in mice in vivo, allowing tumor visualization by microPET/CT at 24 or 48\u00a0h p.i.",

The cumulative number of disintegrations per source organ derived from the biodistribution data was used to predict the radiation absorbed doses in humans using OLINDA/EXM software. Acute toxicity was studied at two weeks post-injection of 111In-BzDTPA-pertuzumab (1.0\u00a0MBq, 20\u00a0\u03bcg) with comparison to control mice injected with unlabeled BzDTPA-pertuzumab (20\u00a0\u03bcg) or Sodium Chloride Injection USP. The dose of 111In-BzDTPA-pertuzumab corresponded to 23-times the human radioactivity dose and 10-times the protein dose on a MBq/kg and mg/kg basis, respectively. Toxicity was assessed by monitoring body mass, complete blood cell count (CBC), hematocrit (Hct), hemoglobin (Hb), serum creatinine (SCr) and alanine aminotransferease (ALT) and by histopathological examination of tissues at necropsy.111In-BzDTPA-pertuzumab exhibited a biphasic elimination from the blood with a distribution half-life (t1/2\u03b1) of 3.8\u00a0h and an elimination half-life (t1/2\u03b2) of 228.2\u00a0h. The radiopharmaceutical was distributed mainly in the blood, heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and spleen. The projected whole-body radiation absorbed dose in humans was 0.05\u00a0mSv/MBq corresponding to a total of 16.8\u00a0mSv for three separate administrations of 111In-BzDTPA-pertuzumab (111\u00a0MBq) planned for the Phase I/II trial. There were slight changes in Hb and SCr levels associated with administration of multiples of the human dose in healthy Balb/c mice but no histopathological abnormalities were noted in any tissues. There were no significant differences in body mass between mice injected with 111In-BzDTPA-pertuzumab or control mice.Preclinical studies predicted that 111In-BzDTPA-pertuzumab is safe to administer to humans at a dose of 111\u00a0MBq (5\u00a0mg). The radiopharmaceutical exhibited preclinical pharmacokinetic, biodistribution and radiation dosimetry properties suitable for advancement to a first-in-humans clinical trial.The results of these studies supported the regulatory approval by Health Canada of 111In-BzDTPA-pertuzumab for a Phase I/II clinical trial of for imaging the response of patients with metastatic BC to treatment with trastuzumab combined with chemotherapy (PETRA trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01805908).",

The goal of this study was to investigate the potential of a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist pioglitazone (PIO) to distinguish tumors and inflammatory lesions in 18F-FDG PET imaging.Studies of cellular uptake of 18F-FDG and Western blot were performed in macrophage (RAW264.7) and three tumor cell lines (A549, KB, and MDA-MB-231) after treatment with PIO. In vivo microPET/CT imaging and biodistribution were performed in animal models.The uptake of 18F-FDG in the macrophages was decreased and uptake of 18F-FDG in the tumor cells was increased when these cells were treated with PIO. Western blot showed that the expression of Glut1 was reduced by treatment of PIO in the macrophage cells, whereas the expression of Glut1 in the tumor cells was increased. In vivo PET/CT imaging revealed that 18F-FDG uptake (%ID/g) in the tumors was enhanced from 4.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.46 to 5.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.92 for A549, from 3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 to 4.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2 for KB, and from 9.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86 to 13.48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.07 for MDA-MB-231 tumors after treatment with PIO.

However, the uptake of inflammation lesions was reduced.In this study, we demonstrated the effect of a PPAR-\u03b3 agonist PIO on 18F-FDG uptake in tumors and inflammation in vitro and in vivo.

     "abstract": "Over the last years Gallium-68 (68Ga) has received tremendous attention for labeling of radiopharmaceuticals for positron emission tomography (PET). 68Ga labeling of biomolecules is currently based on bifunctional chelators containing aminocarboxylates (mainly DOTA and NOTA). We have recently shown that cyclic peptide siderophores have very good complexing properties for 68Ga resulting in high specific activities and excellent metabolic stabilities, in particular triacetylfusarinine-C (TAFC). We postulated, that, starting from its deacetylated form (Fusarinine-C (FSC)) trimeric bioconjugates are directly accessible to develop novel targeting peptide based 68Ga labeled radiopharmaceuticals. As proof of principle we report on the synthesis and 68Ga-radiolabeling of a trimeric FSC-RGD conjugate, [68Ga]FSC-(RGD)3, targeting \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, which is highly expressed during tumor-induced angiogenesis.Synthesis of the RGD peptide was carried out applying solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), followed by the coupling to the siderophore [Fe]FSC via in situ activation using HATU/HOAt and DIPEA. Subsequent demetalation allowed radiolabeling of FSC-(RGD)3 with 68Ga. The radiolabeling procedure was optimized regarding peptide amount, reaction time, temperature as well buffer systems. For in vitro evaluation partition coefficient, protein binding, serum stability, \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin binding affinity, and tumor cell uptake were determined. For in vitro tests as well as for the biodistribution studies \u03b1v\u03b23 positive human melanoma M21 and \u03b1v\u03b23 negative M21-L cells were used.[68Ga]FSC-(RGD)3 was prepared with high radiochemical yield (>\u00a098%). Distribution coefficient was \u2212\u00a03.6 revealing a hydrophilic character, and an IC50 value of 1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 nM was determined indicating a high binding affinity for \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. [68Ga]FSC-(RGD)3 was stable in PBS (pH\u00a07.4), FeCl3- and DTPA-solution as well as in fresh human serum at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0hours. Biodistribution assay confirmed the receptor specific uptake found in vitro. Uptake in the \u03b1v\u03b23 positive tumor was 4.3% ID/g 60\u00a0min p.i. which was 3-fold higher than the monomeric [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD. Tumor to blood ratio of approx. 8 and tumor to muscle ratio of approx. 7 were observed. [68Ga]FSC-(RGD)3 serves as an example for the feasibility of a novel class of bifunctional chelators based on cyclic peptide siderophores and shows excellent targeting properties for \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin in vivo for imaging tumor-induced neovascularization.",

The objective was to evaluate the impact of SAA, PEG2 and 1,2,3-triazole linkers as compare to PEG4 on the tumor uptake and excretion kinetics of 111In radiotracers.DOTA-Galacto-RGD2 was prepared by conjugation of Galacto-RGD2 with DOTA-OSu in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. Its integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 binding affinity was determined using a whole-cell displacement assay against 125I-echistatin bound to U87MG glioma cells, and was compared with those of c(RGDfK), DOTA-3P-RGD2 and DOTA-3P-RGK2 (a nonsense peptide conjugate with \u201cscrambled\u201d RGK sequences). 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2) and 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2) were prepared and evaluated for their tumor-targeting capability and biodistribution properties in athymic nude mice bearing MDA-MB-435 breast tumor xenografts. Planar imaging studies were performed to demonstrate the utility of 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2) and 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2) for breast tumor imaging.IC50 values of DOTA-Galacto-RGD2, DOTA-3P-RGD2, and DOTA-3P-RGK2 were calculated to be 27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02, 29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04, 596\u00a0\u00b1\u00a048\u00a0nM, respectively. The tumor uptake values of 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2) (6.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.98, 6.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.56, 4.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61 and 1.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 %ID/g at 1, 4, 24 and 72\u00a0hours p.i., respectively) were almost identical to those of 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2) (6.17\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.65, 5.94\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.84, 3.40\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.50 and 0.99\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20 %ID/g, respectively). 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2) had a faster clearance from blood and muscle than 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2), leading to higher tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios. 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2) had lower liver uptake and better tumor/liver ratios than 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2). The tumor uptake of 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2) and 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2) was both integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 and RGD-specific. Imaging data suggest that 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2) and 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2) are useful as radiotracers for imaging integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-positive breast tumors.The results from this study suggest that replacing PEG4 linkers between two RGD moieties with a pair of SAA, PEG2 and 1,2,3-triazole groups has little impact on integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 binding affinity and tumor uptake of 111In-labeled dimeric cyclic RGD peptides. Despite the subtle differences in their excretion kinetics from noncancerous tissues, 111In(DOTA-Galacto-RGD2) and 111In(DOTA-3P-RGD2) are useful radiotracers for imaging integrin \u03b1v\u03b23-positive breast tumors.",

     "abstract": "Phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) is a dual-substrate PDE that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP and is selectively expressed in striatal medium spiny neurons. Recent studies have suggested that PDE10A inhibition is a novel approach for the treatment of disorders such as schizophrenia and Huntington's disease. A positron emission tomography (PET) occupancy study can provide useful information for the development of PDE10A inhibitors. We discovered T-773 as a candidate PET radioligand for PDE10A and investigated its properties by in vitro autoradiography and a PET study in a monkey.Profiling of T-773 as a PET radioligand for PDE10A was conducted by in vitro enzyme inhibitory assay, in vitro autoradiography, and PET study in a monkey.T-773 showed a high binding affinity and selectivity for human recombinant PDE10A2 in vitro; the IC50 value in an enzyme inhibitory assay was 0.77\u00a0nmol/L, and selectivity over other PDEs was more than 2500-fold. In autoradiography studies using mouse, rat, monkey, or human brain sections, radiolabeled T-773 selectively accumulated in the striatum. This selective accumulation was not observed in the brain sections of Pde10a-KO mice. The binding of [3H]T-773 to PDE10A in rat brain sections was competitively inhibited by MP-10, a selective PDE10A inhibitor. In rat brain sections, [3H]T-773 bound to a single high affinity site of PDE10A with Kd values of 12.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2 and 4.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0nmol/L in the caudate-putamen and nucleus accumbens, respectively. In a monkey PET study, [11C]T-773 showed good brain penetration and striatum-selective accumulation.These results suggest that [11C]T-773 is a potential PET radioligand for PDE10A.",

     "abstract": "89Zr (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a078.4\u00a0h), a positron-emitting metal, has been exploited for PET studies of antibodies because of its relatively long decay time and facile labeling procedures. Here, we used 89Zr to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of long-circulating liposomes over 168\u00a0h (1\u00a0week). We first developed a liposomal-labeling method using p-isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (df-Bz-NCS) and df-PEG1k-DSPE. Df-Bz-NCS was conjugated to 1\u00a0mol% amino- and amino-PEG2k-DSPE, where the 1\u00a0mol% df-PEG1k-DSPE was incorporated when the liposomes were formulated. Incubation of 89Zr with df, df-PEG1k, and df-PEG2k liposomes for one hour resulted in greater than 68% decay-corrected yield. The loss of the 89Zr label from liposomes after incubation in 50% human serum for 48\u00a0h ranged from ~\u00a01 to 3% across the three formulations. Tail vein administration of the three liposomal formulations in NDL tumor-bearing mice showed that the 89Zr label at the end of the PEG2k brush was retained in the tumor, liver, spleen and whole body for a longer time interval than 89Zr labels located under the PEG2k brush. The blood clearance rate of all three liposomal formulations was similar. Overall, the results indicate that the location of the 89Zr label altered the clearance rate of intracellularly-trapped radioactivity and that df-PEG1k-DSPE provides a stable chelation site for liposomal or lipid-based particle studies over extended periods of time.",

Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) were synthesized by thermal decomposition method to obtain narrow size particles. To increase SPIONs circulation time in blood and decrease its cytotoxicity in healthy tissues, SPIONs surface was modified with 3-Aminopropyltriethoxy Silane (APTES) and then were functionalized with N-Hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) ester of Polyethylene Glycol Maleimide (NHS-PEG-Mal) to conjugate with thiolated 3,6,9,15-tetraazabicyclo[9.3.1]pentadeca-1(15),11,13-triene-3,6,9,-triacetic acid (PCTA) bifunctional chelator (BFC) and Trastuzumab antibody. In order to tumor SPECT/MR imaging, SPIONs were labeled with Indium-111 (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a02.80d). NHS ester of monoethyl malonate (MEM-NHS) was used for conjugation of Doxorubicin (DOX) chemotherapeutic agent onto SPIONs surface. Mono-Ethyl Malonate allows DOX molecules to be attached to SPIONs via pH-sensitive hydrazone bonds which lead to controlled drug release in tumor region. Active and passive tumor targeting were achieved through incorporated anti-HER2 (Trastuzumab) antibody and EPR effect of solid tumors for nanoparticles respectively. In addition to in vitro assessments of modified SPIONs in SKBR3 cell lines, their theranostic effects were evaluated in HER2 + breast tumor bearing BALB/c mice via biodistribution study, dual-modal molecular imaging and tumor diameter measurements.",

Since variations in 123I-PIA levels reflect variations in CYP2C19 activity, CYP2C19 activity can be estimated by quantitative analysis of 123I-PIA levels. Thus, 123I-IMP administration can provide diagnostic information not only regarding cerebral blood flow (rCBF) but also regarding metabolic function. The aim of the present study was to detect variations in CYP activity in mice using metabolite analysis.Metabolism of 125I-IMP in pooled homogenates of mouse liver (MLH) was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the presence or absence of NADPH. The amount of 125I-PIA generated was calculated as the normalized peak area of the chromatogram. Inhibition of 125I-IMP metabolism was evaluated using the inhibitor SKF-525A. A biodistribution study of 125I-IMP was performed to determine the organ distribution of 125I-IMP/125I-IMP metabolites and the effect of SKF-525A. Variations in CYP activity in vivo were detected by administration of 123I-IMP and/or SKF-525A to mice. The liver and the kidney were then excised, homogenized and analyzed using HPLC.125I-IMP was metabolized by MLH in the presence of NADPH, and the production of 125I-PIA was inhibited by SKF-525A. SKF-525A did not greatly affect the biodistribution of 125I-IMP/125I-IMP metabolites in vivo. Both 123I-IMP and 123I-PIA were detected in organs of control mice. However, 123I-PIA was not detected in the livers or kidneys of mice treated with SKF-525A.CYP activity in vivo was inhibited by SKF-525A treatment. Variations in CYP activity could be detected in the blood, liver and kidney as changes in the peak area of 123I-PIA.123I-IMP metabolite analysis has the potential to provide beneficial information for prediction of the effect of medicines, in addition to its contribution to more accurate rCBF diagnosis that reflects individual CYP activity.",

     "abstract": "Bifunctional chelators have been shown to impact the biodistribution of monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based imaging agents. Recently, radiolabeled 1,4,7-triazacyclononane,1-glutaric acid-4,7-acetic acid (NODAGA)-peptide complexes have demonstrated improved in vivo stability and performance compared to their 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) counterparts. Here, we investigated if similar utility could be achieved with mAbs and compared 64Cu-labeled DOTA and NODAGA-immunoconjugates for the detection of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) in a prostate cancer model.DOTA and NODAGA-immunoconjugates of an EpCAM targeting mAb (mAb7) were synthesized and radiolabeled with 64Cu (DOTA: 40\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hr; NODAGA: 25\u00a0\u00b0C for 1\u00a0hr). The average number of chelators per mAb was quantified by isotopic dilution, and the biological activity of the immunoconjugates was evaluated by flow cytometry and ELISA. Radioligand assays were performed to compare cellular uptake and determine the dissociation constant (Kd) and maximum number of binding sites (Bmax) for the immunoconjugates using DsRed-transfected PC3-cells. A PC3-DsRed xenograft tumor model was established in nude mice and used to perform biodistribution studies to compare organ uptake and pharmacokinetics.64Cu-DOTA-mAb7 and 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 were prepared with chelator/protein ratios of 2\u20133 and obtained in comparable radiochemical yields ranging from 59 to 71%. Similar immunoreactivity was observed with both agents, and mock labeling studies indicated that incubation at room temperature or 40\u00a0\u00b0C did not affect potency. 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 demonstrated higher in vitro cellular uptake while 64Cu-DOTA-mAb7 had higher Kd and Bmax values. From the biodistribution data, we found similar tumor uptake (13.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.21%ID/g and 13.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.86%ID/g for 64Cu-DOTA-mAb7 and 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7, respectively) for both agents at 24\u00a0hr, although normal prostate tissue was significantly lower for 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7. 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 also had less accumulation in the liver, suggesting excellent retention of the chelation complex in vivo. This was further confirmed by the higher blood activity of 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7, which corresponds to increased bioavailability afforded by the enhanced in vivo stability of the agent. Although tumor/muscle ratios were comparable, tumor/prostate ratios were >2-fold and 1.5-fold higher for 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 at 24 and 48\u00a0hr, respectively, and suggest better ability to discriminate tumor tissue with 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 in our prostate cancer model.To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first comparison of 64Cu-labeled DOTA and NODAGA immunoconjugates in vivo. Our results show favorable in vivo performance for 64Cu-NODAGA-mAb7 which builds upon previous data on our hybrid mAb7 imaging agent by increasing the detection sensitivity for metastatic prostate tumors, as well as for other types of cancer that express EpCAM.",

Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) participates in this interaction, and is gathering attention as a therapeutic and diagnostic target. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a useful diagnostic method that enables noninvasive in vivo quantitative imaging of biofunctional molecules with probes labeled with positron-emitting radioisotopes. Here a novel 18F labeled probe for PET FABP4 imaging developed through dedicated drug design from a radioiodinated probe we recently reported is evaluated in vitro and in vivo.We designed the [18F]-labeled FTAP1 and FTAP3 probe, composed of a single or triple oxyethylene linker and a triazolopyrimidine scaffold derived from an FABP4 inhibitor. FABP4 binding affinities for chemically synthesized FTAP1 and FTAP3 were measured using FABP4 and 8-anilino-1-naphthalene sulfonic acid. Cell membrane permeability was measured using a commercially available plate assay system. After radiosynthesis, [18F]FTAP1 affinity and selectivity were evaluated using immobilized FABP3, FABP4, and FABP5. Cell uptake was investigated using differentiated adipocytes expressing FABP4 with inhibitor treatment. Following biodistribution studies in C6 glioblastoma-bearing mice, ex vivo autoradiography and immunohistochemistry were performed using thin sliced tumor sections. PET/CT imaging was then performed on C6 tumor bearing mice.FTAP1 showed high FABP4 affinity (Ki\u00a0=\u00a068\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.9 nM) and adequate cell permeability. [18F]FTAP1 with \u2265\u00a098% radiochemical purity was shown to selectively bind to FABP4 (16.3- and 9.3-fold higher than for FABP3 and FABP5, respectively). [18F]FTAP1 was taken up by FABP4 expressing cells, and this uptake could be blocked by an inhibitor, indicating very low non-specific cell binding. [18F]FTAP1 showed high tumor accumulation, which demonstrates its potential use for in vivo tumor PET imaging, and the intratumoral radioactivity distribution corresponded to the FABP4 expression profile.[18F]FTAP1 is a promising PET probe to target FABP4.",

To date, the clinical detection and pathologic progression of hypertrophy remains elusive. Here we tested whether imaging Rho kinase activity would serve an accurate proxy for detecting hypertrophy. Specifically, we examine the use of the N-[11C]-methylated derivative of hydroxyfasudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor, as a biomarker for accurate identification of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy.Both transformed and primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were treated with isoproterenol to induce \u03b2-adrenergic receptor stimulation and hypertrophy. Phenotypic hypertrophy was verified using cytochemical evaluation of cell and nuclear size. Western blot and activity assays were used to detect ERK 1/2 mTOR and Rho kinase activation. N-[11C]-methyl-hydroxyfasudil binding was verified using in vitro binding assays with isoproterenol stimulated cells.Isoproterenol induced a rapid and distinct activation of ERK 1/2, mTOR and Rho kinase with negligible cytotoxicity. Subsequent expansion in cell and nuclear size that is typically associated with hypertrophy was also observed. Enhanced retention of N-[11C]-methyl-hydroxyfasudil observed after ISO-induced Rho kinase activation in hypertrophic cells was prevented by pre-treatment with unlabeled hydroxyfasudil.N-[11C]-methyl-hydroxyfasudil is able to measure increased Rho kinase activity via specific binding in hypertrophied cardiomyocytes and demonstrates the potential for molecular imaging of altered Rho kinase activity in diseases such as cardiac hypertrophy.",

     "abstract": "When pathologically externalized, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a potential surrogate marker for detecting tissue injuries. 99mTc-labeled duramycin is a peptide-based imaging agent that binds PE with high affinity and specificity. The goal of the current study was to investigate the clearance kinetics of 99mTc-labeled duramycin in a large animal model (normal pigs) and to assess its uptake in the heart using a pig model of myocardial ischemia\u2013reperfusion injury.The clearance and distribution of intravenously injected 99mTc-duramycin were characterized in sham-operated animals (n\u00a0=\u00a05). In a closed chest model of myocardial ischemia, coronary occlusion was induced by balloon angioplasty (n\u00a0=\u00a09). 99mTc-duramycin (10\u201315\u00a0mCi) was injected intravenously at 1\u00a0hour after reperfusion. SPECT/CT was acquired at 1 and 3\u00a0hours after injection. Cardiac tissues were analyzed for changes associated with acute cellular injuries. Autoradiography and gamma counting were used to determine radioactivity uptake. For the remaining animals, 99mTc-tetrafosamin scan was performed on the second day to identify the infarct site.Intravenously injected 99mTc-duramycin cleared from circulation predominantly via the renal/urinary tract with an \u03b1-phase half-life of 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0minutes and \u03b2-phase half-life of 179.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a064.7\u00a0minutes.

The ratios between normal heart and liver were 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, 0.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13, 0.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.19 and 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.14. In vivo visualization of focal radioactivity uptake in the ischemic heart was attainable as early as 30\u00a0min post-injection. The in vivo ischemic-to-normal uptake ratios were 3.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.74 and 3.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.91 at 1 and 3\u00a0hours post-injection, respectively. Ischemic-to-lung ratios were 4.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.85 and 4.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.57; and ischemic-to-liver ratios were 2.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30 to 3.23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.78. The size of 99mTc-duramycin positive myocardium was qualitatively larger than the infarct size delineated by the perfusion defect in 99mTc-tetrafosmin uptake. This was consistent with findings from tissue analysis and autoradiography.99mTc-duramycin was demonstrated, in a large animal model, to have suitable clearance and biodistribution profiles for imaging. The agent has an avid target uptake and a fast background clearance. It is appropriate for imaging myocardial injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion.",

Continuous and discrete arterial blood samples were manually obtained, to generate metabolite-corrected input functions. Parametric volume-of-distribution (VT) images were obtained using Logan analysis. The selectivity profile of PK-209 was assessed in vitro, on a broad screen of 79 targets.PK-209 was at least 50-fold more selective for NMDArs over all other targets examined. At baseline, prolonged retention of radioactivity was observed in NMDAr-rich cortical regions relative to the cerebellum. Pretreatment with MK-801 reduced the VT of [18F]PK-209 compared with baseline in two of three subjects. The rate of radioligand metabolism was high, both at baseline and after MK-801 administration.PK-209 targets the intrachannel site with high selectivity. Imaging of the NMDAr is feasible with [18F]PK-209, despite its fast metabolism. Further in vivo evaluation in humans is warranted.",

Cells transfected with hOAT1 or hOCT2 were used to analyze the role of these SLC transporters. Somatostatin (177Lu-DOTA-[Tyr3]octreotate, 177Lu-DOTA-[1-Nal3]octreotide), gastrin (177Lu-DOTA-sargastrin) and bombesin (177Lu-DOTA-[Pro1,Tyr4]bombesin, 177Lu-DOTA-[Lys3]bombesin, 177Lu-PCTA-[Lys3]bombesin) analogues were involved in the study.RAP, albumin and low temperature decreased the accumulation of all the studied peptides significantly. With one exception, rottlerin caused the concentration dependent inhibition of the cellular accumulation of the radiopeptides. No significant differences in the uptake of the peptides between the control cells and those transfected with hOAT1 or hOCT2 were observed.The study showed that active transport mechanisms are decisive for the cellular accumulation in all tested 177Lu-labeled somatostatin, gastrin and bombesin analogues. Besides receptor-mediated endocytosis by megalin, FPE participates significantly in the uptake. The tested types of renal SLC transporters are not involved in this process.",

Radioiodination of the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab using NHS-IB-d-EEEG and Mal-d-GEEEK-IB was compared. Paired-label internalization assays on BT474 breast carcinoma cells and biodistribution studies in athymic mice bearing BT474M1 xenografts were performed to evaluate the two radioiodinated d-peptide trastuzumab conjugates.NHS-[131I]IB-d-EEEG was produced in 53.8%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.4% and conjugated to trastuzumab in 39.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.6% yield.

     "abstract": "Ghrelin is an endogenous hormone present in blood. It is released from the oxyntic cells (X/A-like cells) of the stomach and fundus and can exist in two forms: as an acylated and des-acylated ghrelin. Ghrelin is an endogenous ligand of the growth hormone receptor (growth hormone secretagogue receptor, GHS-R). Overexpression of GHS-R1a receptor was identified in cells of different types of tumors (e.g. pituitary adenoma, neuroendocrine tumors of the thyroid, lung, breast, gonads, prostate, stomach, colorectal, endocrine and non-endocrine pancreatic tumors). This fact suggests that gamma radionuclide labeled ghrelin peptide may be considered as a potential diagnostic radiopharmaceutical.Ghrelin peptide labeled with mono- and trivalent technetium-99m complexes, 99mTc-Lys-GHR, has been prepared on the n.c.a. scale. The physicochemical (stability, charge, shape, lipophilicity) and biological (receptor affinity, biodistribution) properties of the conjugates have been studied relevant to use the conjugates as receptor-based diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals.The obtained conjugates [99mTc(CO)3LN,O(CN-Lys-GHR)]+, 99mTc(CO)3LS,O(CN-Lys-GHR) and 99mTc(NS3)(CN-Lys-GHR) show different shape, charge, lipophilicity and two of them, 99mTc(CO)3LS,O(CN-Lys-GHR) and 99mTc(NS3)(CN-Lys-GHR), high stability in neutral aqueous solutions, even in the presence of excess concentration of histidine/cysteine competitive standard ligands or human serum. The in vitro binding affinity of 99mTc-Lys-GHR conjugates with respect to growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R1a) present on DU-145 cells was in the range of IC50 from 45 to 54\u00a0nM.

     "abstract": "Discrimination between (high-grade) brain tumor recurrence and radiation necrosis (RN) remains a diagnostic challenge because both entities have similar imaging characteristics on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Metabolic imaging, such as positron emission tomography (PET) could overcome this diagnostic dilemma. In this study, we investigated the potential of 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG), O-(2-[18F]-fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (18F-FET), and [18F]-Fluoromethyl-dimethyl-2-hydroxyethylammonium (18F-fluoromethylcholine, 18F-FCho) PET in discriminating high-grade tumor from RN.We developed a glioblastoma (GB) rat model by inoculating F98 GB cells into the right frontal region. Induction of RN was achieved by irradiating the right frontal region with 60\u00a0Gy using three arcs with a beam aperture of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mm (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Dynamic PET imaging with 18F-FDG, 18F-FET, and 18F-FCho, as well as 18F-FDG PET at a delayed time interval (240\u00a0min postinjection), was acquired.MRI revealed contrast-enhancing tumors at 15\u00a0days after inoculation (n\u00a0=\u00a04) and contrast-enhancing RN lesions 5\u20136\u00a0months postirradiation (n\u00a0=\u00a03). On 18F-FDG PET, the mean lesion-to-normal ratio (LNRmean) was significantly higher in GB than in RN (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034). The difference in the LNRmean between tumors and RN was higher on the late 18F-FDG PET images than on the PET images reconstructed from the last time frame of the dynamic acquisition (this is at a conventional time interval). LNRs obtained from 18F-FCho PET were not significantly different between GB and RN (p\u00a0=\u00a01.000). On 18F-FET PET, the LNRmean was significantly higher in GB compared to RN (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034).Unlike 18F-FCho, 18F-FDG and 18F-FET PET were effective in discriminating GB from RN. Interestingly, in the case of 18F-FDG, delayed PET seems particularly useful.Our results suggest that (delayed) 18F-FDG and 18F-FET PET can be used to discriminate GB (recurrence) from RN. Confirmation of these results in clinical studies is needed.",

Sequential lung sections were immunostained for caspase activation and endothelial and epithelial cells.Lung DU uptake increased significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) by 39% and 146% in 48-hr and 60-hr exposed rats, respectively, compared to normoxic rats. There was strong correlation (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.82, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) between lung DU uptake and the number of cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) positive cells, and endothelial cells accounted for more than 50% of CC3 positive cells in the hyperoxic lungs.

By 60\u00a0hours there was evidence of edema, and modest neutrophilic infiltrate.Rat lung DU uptake in vivo increased after just 48\u00a0hours of >\u00a098% O2 exposure, prior to the onset of any substantial evidence of lung injury.

     "abstract": "Nearly 20\u00a0years after the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis (TB) a global public health emergency, TB still remains a major global threat with 8.6 million new cases and 1.3 million deaths annually. Mycobacterium tuberculosis adapts to a quiescent physiological state, and is notable for complex interaction with the host, producing poorly-understood disease states ranging from latent infection to fully active disease. Of the approximately 2.5 billion people latently infected with M. tuberculosis, many will develop reactivation disease (relapse), years after the initial infection. While progress has been made on some fronts, the alarming spread of multidrug-resistant, extensively drug-resistant, and more recently totally-drug resistant strains is of grave concern. New tools are urgently needed for rapidly diagnosing TB, monitoring TB treatments and to allow unique insights into disease pathogenesis. Nuclear bioimaging is a powerful, noninvasive tool that can rapidly provide three-dimensional views of disease processes deep within the body and conduct noninvasive longitudinal assessments of the same patient. In this review, we discuss the application of nuclear bioimaging to TB, including the current state of the field, considerations for radioprobe development, study of TB drug pharmacokinetics in infected tissues, and areas of research and clinical needs that could be addressed by nuclear bioimaging. These technologies are an emerging field of research, overcome several fundamental limitations of current tools, and will have a broad impact on both basic research and patient care. Beyond diagnosis and monitoring disease, these technologies will also allow unique insights into understanding disease pathogenesis; and expedite bench-to-bedside translation of new therapeutics. Finally, since molecular imaging is readily available for humans, validated tracers will become valuable tools for clinical applications.",

Two groups of ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice (n\u00a0=\u00a012 each group) on AGD and ND were imaged three times with 99mTc-TFI and a high-resolution SPECT system at 20\u201325, 30\u201340, and 48\u201352 weeks to study the evolution of atherosclerotic plaque.Focal radioactive accumulations in the aortic arch region were observed in the ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice (n\u00a0=\u00a012) on AGD but not in the ApoE+/+ mice on ND (n\u00a0=\u00a010). Apo-E\u2212/\u2212 mice on ND (n\u00a0=\u00a011) exhibited lower radioactive uptake than ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice on AGD (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Co-injection of an excess of cold ligand with 99mTc-TFI resulted in significant reduction of 99mTc-TFI uptake in the ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice on AGD. Longitudinal studies showed that 99mTc-TFI uptake in the aortas of ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice progressively increased from 20 to 48\u00a0weeks. Real-time PCR assays demonstrated that atherosclerotic aortas expressed significantly higher IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 than the aortas from wild-type controls.Atherosclerotic plaques were detected by 99mTc-TFI imaging in ApoE\u2212/\u2212 mice. 99mTc-TFI is promising for specific detection of inflammatory response in atherosclerotic plaques.",

The appropriateness of using the Logan graphical analyses for reversibly binding radiotracers in these models was evaluated and confirmed. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) of the regions of interest to reference muscle tissue were compared to those based on the image-derived input function from arterial blood. SUVs were calculated in the same individuals.DVRs based on reference muscle tissue gave results similar to those based on the arterial blood and may be preferred since they are simpler to calculate. In the inter-group comparisons of baseline versus chemotherapy treatment or AnxA5 versus control protein, differences in DVR quantifications had a 20- to 40-fold higher statistical significance than differences in SUVs. As quantified using the control protein, the amount of free ligand in the vascular space of tumours may be large due to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) contributions at baseline and affected during treatment, which has implications for quantifications of the specifically bound radioligand.These results demonstrate that the quantification method as well as the controls used can be important for interpreting the uptake in tumours of the medium-sized protein ligand AnxA5 and its use in monitoring the effects of therapy on cell death in the tumours.These results provide additional support for the recognition that more detailed investigations on the effects of the tumour microenvironment on the targeting capability of imaging radiopharmaceuticals are needed.",

However, radiochemical yields for [131I]SGMIB synthesis are low, which we hypothesize is due to steric hindrance from the Boc-protected guanidinomethyl group ortho to the tin moiety. To overcome this, we developed the isomeric compound, N-succinimidyl 3-guanidinomethyl-5-[131I]iodobenzoate (iso-[131I]SGMIB) wherein this bulky group was moved from ortho to meta position.Boc2-iso-SGMIB standard and its tin precursor, N-succinimidyl 3-((1,2-bis(tert-butoxycarbonyl)guanidino)methyl)-5-(trimethylstannyl)benzoate (Boc2-iso-SGMTB), were synthesized using two disparate routes, and iso-[*I]SGMIB synthesized from the tin precursor. Two HER2-targeted vectors \u2014 trastuzumab (Tras) and a nanobody 5\u00a0F7 (Nb) \u2014 were labeled using iso-[\u204eI]SGMIB and [\u204eI]SGMIB. Paired-label internalization assays in vitro with both proteins, and biodistribution in vivo with trastuzumab, labeled using the two isomeric prosthetic agents were performed.When the reactions were performed under identical conditions, radioiodination yields for the synthesis of Boc2-iso-[131I]SGMIB were significantly higher than those for Boc2-[131I]SGMIB (70.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0% vs 56.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.5%).

Internalization assays performed on BT474 cells with 5\u00a0F7 Nb indicated similar residualizing capacity over 6\u00a0h; however, at 24\u00a0h, radioactivity retained intracellularly for iso-[131I]SGMIB-Nb was lower than for [125I]SGMIB-Nb (46.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3% vs 56.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5%); similar results were obtained using Tras. Likewise, a paired-label biodistribution of Tras labeled using iso-[125I]SGMIB and [131I]SGMIB indicated an up to 22% tumor uptake advantage at later time points for [131I]SGMIB-Tras.Given the higher labeling efficiency obtained with iso-SGMIB, this residualizing agent might be of value for use with shorter half-life radiohalogens.",

Global transcription patterns of irradiated kidney cortex and medulla were assessed and enriched biological processes were determined from the regulated gene sets using Gene Ontology terms.The average dose rates investigated were 1.6, 0.84, 0.23, 0.11 and 0.028\u00a0mGy/min, with an absorbed dose of 0.3\u00a0Gy. At 45, 90 and 140\u00a0days, the absorbed doses were estimated to 0.3, 3, and 10\u00a0Gy. In general, the number of differentially regulated transcripts increased with time after injection, and decreased with absorbed dose for both kidney cortex and medulla. Differentially regulated transcripts were predominantly involved in metabolic and stress response-related processes dependent on dose rate, as well as transcripts associated with metabolic and cellular integrity at later time points.The observed transcriptional response in kidney tissue was diverse due to difference in absorbed dose, dose rate and time after exposure. Nevertheless, several transcripts were significantly regulated in all groups despite differences in exposure parameters, which may indicate potential biomarkers for exposure of kidney tissue.",

Non-invasive diagnostic imaging, including PET with [18F]FDG, has inadequate resolution for detection of small (2\u20133\u00a0mm) pancreatic tumours. We demonstrated the efficacy of PET imaging with an 18F-labelled lactose derivative, [18F]FEDL, that targets HIP/PAP, a biomarker that is overexpressed in the peritumoural pancreas. We developed another analogue, 1-[18F]fluoroethyl lactose ([18F]FEL), which is simpler to synthesise, for the same application. We conducted a preliminary evaluation of the new probe and its efficacy in detecting orthotopic pancreatic carcinoma xenografts in mice.Xenografts were developed in nude mice by injecting L3.6pl/GL+ pancreatic carcinoma cells into the pancreas of each mouse. Tumour growth was monitored by bioluminescence imaging (BLI); accuracy of BLI tumour size estimates was verified by MRI in two representative mice. When the tumour size reached approximately 2\u20133\u00a0mm, the animals were injected with [18F]FEL (3.7\u00a0MBq) and underwent static PET/CT scans. Blood samples were collected at 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60\u00a0min after [18F]FEL injection to track blood clearance. Following imaging, animals were sacrificed and their organs and tumours/pancreatic tissue were collected and counted on a gamma counter. Pancreas, including tumour, was frozen, sliced and used for autoradiography and immunohistochemical analysis of HIP/PAP expression.Tumour growth was rapid, as observed by BLI and MRI. Blood clearance of [18F]FEL was bi-exponential, with half-lives of approximately 3.5\u00a0min and 40\u00a0min. Mean accumulation of [18F]FEL in the peritumoural pancreatic tissue was 1.29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.295 %ID/g, and that in the normal pancreas of control animals was 0.090\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.101 %ID/g. [18F]FEL was cleared predominantly by the kidneys.

In the cervical section, the greatest amount of binding appeared to be in the SDH. Ex vivo studies showed approximately 6% of 18F-fallypride in SDH compared to that observed in the striatum. In vivo analysis of both 18F-fallypride and 11C-fallypride in the spinal cord were comparable to that in the extrastriatal regions.

The subsequent capture of the EOCs was traced by estimation of activity in individual organs, autoradiography and fluorescence microscopy.111In activity was found in tumour and other organs. However, varying parts of the activity originated from free 111In lost from EOCs. Autoradiography demonstrated accumulation of 111In activity in the tumour rim. Microscopy proved that a least part of this radioactivity originated from the presence of human derived EOCs and that those EOCs were not located in the endothelial lining of vessels, in the tumour.The results demonstrated the presence of xenotransplanted EOCs in the rim of a C3H mammary carcinoma. They were, however, not located in the endothelial lining of the vessels, thus indicating that their effect in vasculogenesis might be mediated via paracrine mechanisms rather than differentiating into endothelial cells (ECs) in tumour vessels.",

This study was aimed to investigate the diversity of RGD radiotracers in monitoring antiangiogenic agent's effects and the underlying mechanism in ovarian cancer-bearing mice with a new agent flavopiridol compared with paclitaxel.Ovarian cancer SKOV-3 xenograft-bearing mice were established and divided into three groups, flavopiridol, paclitaxel and control. Flavopiridol (5\u00a0mg/kg body weight) and paclitaxel (20\u00a0mg/kg body weight) were administered every 3\u00a0days for 16\u00a0days. Tumor growth and proliferation were monitored by caliper measurements and immunofluorescence staining. Antiangiogenic effects were determined by tumor microvessel density (MVD) in vivo and by endothelial cell tube formation assay in vitro, respectively. 99mTc-3P-RGD2 was prepared, and its biodistribution studies were carried out. The effect of antiangiogenesis therapy on integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 expression was studied by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry.Both paclitaxel and flavopiridol therapy could apparently inhibit tumor growth and proliferation, and antiangiogenic effects of therapy were validated in vivo and in vitro.

[14C]-Acetoacetate, a non-positron (\u03b2\u00a0\u2212) emitting radiotracer, was used to characterize the arterial blood input function and myocardial mitochondrial uptake. Afterward, [11C]-acetoacetate (\u03b2\u00a0+) myocardial PET images were obtained for kinetic analysis and heart function assessment in control Dox(\u2212) (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and treated Dox(+) (n\u00a0=\u00a06) rats. The uptake rate (K1) and myocardial clearance rate (k2or kmono) were extracted.[14C]-Acetoacetate in the blood was increased in Dox(+), from 2\u00a0min post-injection until the last withdrawal point when the heart was harvested, as well as the uptake in the heart and myocardial mitochondria (unpaired t-test, p <\u00a00.05). PET kinetic analysis of [11C]-acetoacetate showed that rate constants K1, k2 and kmono were decreased in Dox(+) (p <\u00a00.05) combined with a reduction of 24% of the left ventricular ejection fraction (p <\u00a00.001).Radioactive acetoacetate ex vivo analysis [14C], and in vivo kinetic [11C] studies provided evidence that [11C]-acetoacetate can assess heart failure Dox(+). Contrary to myocardial flow reserve (rest\u2013stress protocol), [11C]-acetoacetate can be used to assess reduced kinetic rate constants without requirement of hyperemic stress response. The proposed [11C]-acetoacetate cardiac radiotracer in the investigation of heart disease is novel and paves the way to a potential role for [11C]-acetoacetate in cardiac pathophysiology.",

Over the past several years, [11C]DAA1106 has emerged as a reliable radiotracer for labeling TSPO with high affinity during positron emission tomography (PET) scanning. While [11C]DAA1106 PET scanning has been used in several research studies, a radiation dosimetry study of this radiotracer in humans has not yet been published.Twelve healthy participants underwent full body dynamic [11C]DAA1106 PET scanning, with 8 sequential whole body scans (approximately 12 bed positions each), following a single injection. Regions of interest were drawn manually, and time activity curves (TACs) were obtained for 15 organs. OLINDA/EXM 1.1 was used to compute radiation absorbed doses to the target organs, as well as effective dose (ED) and effective dose equivalent (EDE).The ED and EDE were 4.06 \u00b1 0.58\u00a0\u03bcSv/MBq and 5.89 \u00b1 0.83\u00a0\u03bcSv/MBq, respectively. The highest absorbed doses were to the heart wall, kidney, liver, pancreas, and spleen. TACs revealed that peak dose rates are during the first scan (at 6\u00a0min) for all organs other than the urinary bladder wall, which had its peak dose rate during the fourth scan (at 30\u00a0min).The recently developed radiotracer [11C]DAA1106 has its EDE and target-organ absorbed dose such that, for a single administration, its radiation dosimetry is well within the U.S. FDA guidelines for basic research studies in adults. This dose level implies that the dosimetry for multiple [11C]DAA1106 scans within a given year also falls within FDA guidelines, and this favorable property makes this radiotracer suitable for examining microglial activation repeatedly over time, which may in the future be useful for longitudinal tracking of disease progression and monitoring of therapy response in conditions marked by neuroinflammation (e.g., head trauma and multiple sclerosis).",

     "abstract": "The niobium-90 radioisotope (90Nb) holds considerable promise for use in immuno-PET, due to its decay parameters (t\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a014.6\u00a0h, positron yield\u00a0=\u00a053%, E\u00df+mean\u00a0=\u00a00.35\u00a0MeV and E\u00df+max = 1.5\u00a0MeV). In particular, 90Nb appears well suited to detect in vivo the pharmacokinetics of large targeting vectors (50\u2013150\u00a0kDa). In order to be useful for immuno-PET chelators are required to both stabilize the radionuclide in terms of coordination chemistry and to facilitate the covalent attachment to the targeting vector. Different chelators were evaluated for this purpose in terms of radiolabelling efficiency and stability of the radiolabelled Nb(V) complex and in order to determine the most suitable candidate for conjugation to a biologically relevant targeting vector. For the purpose of studying the complexation properties the niobium radioisotope 95Nb was used as an analogue of 90Nb, by virtue of its longer half-life (35\u00a0days) and lower cost (reactor-based production). Acyclic and cyclic chelators were investigated, with desferroxamine [Df: (N'-{5-[acetyl(hydroxy)amino]pentyl}-N-[5-({4-[(5-aminopentyl) (hydroxy)amino]-4-oxobutanoyl} amino)pentyl]-N-hydroxysuccinamide)] emerging as the best candidate. Greater than 99% radiolabelling was achieved at room temperature over a wide pH range. The 95Nb-Df complex is sufficiently stable for immuno-PET (<\u00a07% degradation over 7\u00a0days in vitro). As a proof-of-principle, a Df conjugate featuring a well-established targeting vector, (D)-Phe1-octreotide, was evaluated. The fast labelling kinetics of the unconjugated chelator (Df) were retained for Df-succinyl-(D)Phe1-octreotide (Df-OC), with\u00a0>\u00a090% labelling after 1\u00a0h at room temperature over the pH range 5\u20137. Stability studies, performed in vitro in serum at physiological temperature (37\u00a0\u00b0C), revealed that 87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% of the radiolabelled molecule remained intact after 7\u00a0days. Competition studies with relevant metal ions (zirconium(IV), gallium(III) and iron(III)) have been performed with Df-OC to gain insight to the relative stability [Nb-Df]-OC complex to transmetallation. At equimolar metal ion concentrations the [Nb-Df]-OC complex showed the greatest overall stability. The favourable radiolabelling characteristics of Df-OC and its stability indicate that Df is a potentially very useful chelator for the development of radiopharmaceuticals for 90Nb-PET.",

Non-specific organ distribution, blood clearance, and excretion were investigated ex vivo in healthy rats. The binding specificity of the radioligands was assessed in vitro using autoradiography on cryosections of dog fibrotic heart tissue.The yield of NOTA-PEG2-c[CPGRVMHGLHLGDDEGPC] and NODAGA-PEG2-c[CPGRVMHGLHLGDDEGPC] was 56% and 41%, respectively. Non-decay-corrected radiochemical yield was 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% with radiochemical purity of 95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04%.

Moderation of the biodistribution could be achieved by variation of the charge on the complex moiety of the agents. The combination of the fast clearance from non-target organs as well as organs of interest such as lung, heart, and liver and binding specificity to the target tissue suggests the potential of the analogs for the imaging of fibrosis.",

     "abstract": "2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) is a glucose surrogate commonly used in clinical or animal imaging but rarely in plant imaging to trace glucose metabolism. Recently, 18FDG has been employed in plant imaging for studying photoassimilate translocation and glycoside biosynthesis. There is growing evidence that 18FDG could be used as a tracer in plant imaging studies to trace sugar dynamics. However, to confirm this hypothesis, it was necessary to show that the observed 18FDG distribution in an intact plant is an outcome of the chemical nature of the introduced radiotracer and not of the plant vascular architecture or radiotracer introduction method.In the present work, we fed 18FDG and [68Ga]gallium-citrate (68Ga-citrate) solution through mature Arabidopsis thaliana leaf and monitored subsequent radioactivity distribution using positron autoradiography. The possible route of radioactivity translocation was elucidated through stem-girdling experiments. We also employed a bi-functional positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) modality to capture 18FDG radiotracer dynamics in one of the plants in order to assess applicability of PET/CT for 4-D imaging in an intact plant.Autoradiography results showed that [18F] radioactivity accumulated mostly in roots and young growing parts such as the shoot apex, which are known to act as sinks for photoassimilate. [18F] radioactivity translocation, in this case, occurred mainly via phloem. PET/CT results corroborated with autoradiography. [68Ga] radioactivity, on the other hand, was mainly translocated to neighboring leaves and its translocation occurred via both xylem and phloem.The radioactivity distribution pattern and translocation route observed after 18FDG feeding is markedly different from that of 68Ga-citrate. [18F] radioactivity distribution pattern in an intact plant is found similar to the typical distribution pattern of photoassimilates. Despite its limitations in quantification and resolution, PET/CT could be a useful tool to elucidate in vivo dynamics of [18F] radioactivity in intact plants.",

The radionuclide labeling of SVF demonstrated significant safety profile as evaluated by apoptotic assays.99mTc-HMPAO labeling efficiency of 33% of total SV fraction would produce sufficient radioactive signals that would enable for in vivo tracking of cells by SPECT-CT.

High FDG accumulation occurred primarily in proximity to necrotic or pimonidazole adduct positive regions, while high Cu-ATSM accumulation occurred primarily in live cell regions separate from the necrotic regions. The adenocarcinoma CTOS xenograft had the stereotypical glandular structure, resulting in more intricately mixed regions of live and necrotic cells compared to those observed in the SCC CTOS or the cell line xenografts.Tumor morphological characteristics, specifically the spatial distribution of live and necrotic cell regions, appeared to be one of the most critical factors determining the regional overlap of FDG and Cu-ATSM distributions in adenocarcinoma.",

High sigma-1 receptor binding may, however, limit its future application as a PET probe for imaging the NR2B subunit-containing NMDAr.

In this study, we evaluated the value of [18F] FLT PET-CT in predicting the OS of patients with recurrent malignant glioma.Fifty-six patients with recurrent malignant glioma were enrolled in this prospective study. The PET-CT and contrast-enhanced MRI scans were performed in all patients. Tumor volume was determined from both PET image (proliferative volume, PV) and MRI image (Vol-MRI). Patients were followed up clinically until death. The likelihood of using PET-derived parameters of SUVmax, tumor-to-normal (T/N) ratio, and PV to predict the OS of patients were assessed in comparison with Vol-MRI and other clinical parameters.The follow up periods for all patients ranged from 1.5 to 35.6 months with median of 9.8 months. Univariate analysis showed that the following parameters were significantly correlated with OS: grade of primary tumor (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042), Karnofsky performance score (KPS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), T/N ratio (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), Vol-MRI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041), and PV (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Acute lymphadenitis (AL) was induced by injecting concanavalin A (Con A) into the hind footpad, and chronic lymphadenitis (CL) was induced by daily injection of Con A into the tissues surrounding the popliteal LNs for 2\u00a0weeks. Main lesions of all animal models were established in lumbar and/or inguinal LNs. Biodistribution and dynamic PET imaging data were acquired after tracer injection.

     "abstract": "Over-expression of chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is present in a majority of cancers, has been linked to an aggressive phenotype, and may indicate the metastatic potential of primary tumor. Several CXCR4 targeted therapeutics are in clinical trials and the development of the corresponding imaging agents is an area of active interest. Previously, 64Cu-labeled imaging agents for CXCR4 have provided clear images of CXCR4-bearing tissues in relevant experimental models but demonstrated fast washout from tissues harboring receptor. Addition of stabilizing bridges is known to provide more robust chelator-Cu(II) complexes. In addition, bridged cyclam-based CXCR4 binding agents demonstrated increased receptor residence times relative to existing agents. Based on that knowledge we synthesized several bridged cyclam analogs of AMD3465, a monocyclam-based CXCR4 imaging agent, to increase the retention time of the tracer bound to the receptor to allow for protracted imaging and improved target-to-non-target ratios. Specific accumulation of two radiolabeled, cross-bridged analogs ([64Cu] RAD1-24 and [64Cu]RAD1-52) was observed in U87-stb-CXCR4 tumors in both PET/CT imaging and biodistribution studies. At 90\u00a0min post-injection of radiotracer, tumor-to-muscle and tumor-to-blood ratios reached 106.05\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017.19 and 28.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.78, respectively, for cross-bridged pyrimidine analog [64Cu]RAD1-52. Receptor blockade performed in vivo denoted target binding specificity.

The method is intended to increase \u201cthroughput\u201d in PET research studies of cardiac dynamics or to obtain information derived from such studies, e.g. tracer concentration in end-diastolic left ventricular blood.An imaging bed with provisions for warming, anesthetic delivery, etc., was fabricated by 3D printing to allow simultaneous PET imaging of two side-by-side mice. After electrode attachment, tracer injection and placement of the animals in the scanner field of view, ECG signals from each animal were continuously analyzed and independent trigger markers generated whenever an R-wave was detected in each signal. PET image data were acquired in \u201clist\u201d mode and these trigger markers were inserted into this list along with the image data. Since each mouse is in a different spatial location in the FOV, sorting of these data using trigger markers first from one animal and then the other yields two independent and correctly formed ECG-gated image sequences that reflect the dynamical properties of the heart during an \u201caverage\u201d cardiac cycle.The described method yields two independent ECG-gated image sequences that exhibit the expected properties in each animal, e.g. variation of the ventricular cavity volumes from maximum to minimum and back during the cardiac cycle in the processed animal with little or no variation in these volumes during the cardiac cycle in the unprocessed animal.ECG-gated image sequences for each of several animals can be created from a single list mode data collection using the described method. In principle, this method can be extended to more than two mice (or other animals) and to other forms of physiological gating, e.g. respiratory gating, when several subjects are imaged at the same time.",

     "abstract": "Neuroinflammatory processes play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other brain disorders, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered therapeutic candidates. As a biomarker of neuroinflammatory processes, 11C-labeled ketoprofen methyl ester ([11C]KTP-Me) was designed to allow cerebral penetration of ketoprofen (KTP), an active form of a selective cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitor that acts as an NSAID. Rat neuroinflammation models indicate that [11C]KTP-Me enters the brain and is retained in inflammatory lesions, accumulating in activated microglia. [11C]KTP-Me is washed out from normal tissues, leading to the present first-in-human exploratory study.[11C]KTP-Me was synthesized by rapid C-[11C]methylation of [11C]CH3I and the corresponding arylacetate precursor, purified with high-performance liquid chromatography, and prepared as an injectable solution including PEG400, providing radiochemical purity of >\u00a099% and specific activity of >\u00a025\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol at injection. Six young healthy male humans were injected with [11C]KTP-Me and scanned with PET camera to determine the early-phase brain time course followed by three whole-body scans starting 8, 20, and 40\u00a0min post-injection, together with sequential blood sampling and labeled metabolite analysis.No adverse effects were observed during PET scanning after [11C]KTP-Me injection. [11C]KTP-Me was rapidly metabolized to 11C-labeled ketoprofen ([11C]KTP) within 2\u20133\u00a0min and was gradually cleared from blood. The radioactivity entered the brain with an average peak cortical SUV of 1.5 at 2\u00a0min. The cortical activity was gradually washed out. Whole-body images indicated that the urinary bladder was the major excretory pathway. The organ with the highest radiation dose was the urinary bladder (average dose of 41\u03bcGy/MBq, respectively). The mean effective dose was 4.7\u00a0\u03bcSv/MBq, which was comparable to other 11C-labeled radiopharmaceuticals.[11C]KTP-Me demonstrated a favorable dosimetry, biodistribution, and safety profile. [11C]KTP-Me entered the human brain, and the radioactivity was washed out from cerebral tissue. These data warrant further exploratory studies on patients with neuroinflammation.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxia plays a negative role in the clinical management of cancer. Detection of hypoxic status of a cancer is important for selecting patients for hypoxia directed therapy. Though [18\u00a0F]fluoromisonidazole ([18\u00a0F]FMISO), a PET radiopharmaceutical, is presently being used in the clinic for the detection of hypoxia, considering the logistical advantages of 99mTc and wider availability of SPECT scanners, a radiopharmaceutical based on this isotope may find wider applicability.Nine nitroimidazole (2-, 4- and 5-nitroimidazole) ligands were synthesized and radiolabeled using [99mTc(CO)3(H2O)3]+ precursor to obtain a group of complexes possessing different single electron reduction potential (SERP), overall charge and lipophilicity, the three attributes which decide the efficacy of the complex to detect hypoxic cells in vivo. The nitroimidazole-99mTc(CO)3 complexes as well as [18\u00a0F]FMISO were evaluated in fibrosarcoma tumor bearing mice.The 99mTc(CO)3 complexes of nitroimidazole iminodiacetic acid (IDA) showed better tumor uptake and retention than nitroimidazole diethylenetriamine (DETA) and nitroimidazole aminoethylglycine (AEG) complexes. Tumor uptake observed with [18\u00a0F]FMISO was higher than any of the nitroimidazole-IDA- 99mTc(CO)3 complexes. However, [18\u00a0F]FMISO clearance from tumor was found to be faster compared to 2-nitroimidazole-IDA-99mTc(CO)3 complex. Observed tumor uptake and retention of the radiotracers evaluated could be correlated to its blood clearance pattern and SERP.Results of the present study indicated that uptake of the radiotracer in tumor is closely associated with its rate of clearance from blood. The study also indicated that along with SERP, clearance of radiotracer from blood (net effect of charge and lipophilicity) is a critical factor which decides the in vivo efficacy of the hypoxia detecting radiopharmaceutical.",

In the radiolabeling study we dealt with the precipitation of MNT (pI 5.7) at the labeling pH (4.5\u20135.5) of 67Ga. Cellular and nuclei uptake of 67Ga-NOTA-MNT by the A431 cell line was determined. Its specific cytotoxicity was compared to that of 67Ga-EDTA, 67Ga-NOTA-BSA and 67Ga-NOTA-hEGF, in A431 and U87MGWTT, cell lines, by clonogenic assay. Dosimetry studies were also performed.67Ga-NOTA-MNT was produced with 90% yield and specific activity of 25.6\u00a0mCi/mg. The in vitro kinetics revealed an increased uptake over 24\u00a0h. 55% of the internalized radioactivity was detected in the nuclei at 1\u00a0h. The cytotoxicity of 67Ga-NOTA-MNT on A431 cell line was 17 and 385-fold higher when compared to non-specific 67Ga-NOTA-BSA and 67Ga-EDTA.

SWL, a small peptide identified by phage display, has high binding affinity to EphA2, suggesting that it could be exploited for targeted molecular imaging. Therefore, a novel peptide-based probe, 99mTc-HYNIC-SWL, was developed and its potential to specifically target EphA2-positive tumors was investigated.The SWL peptide was labeled with hydrazinonicotinic acid (HYNIC), followed by 99mTc labeling. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out to detect the expression of EphA2 in A549 lung cancer cells and OCM-1 melanoma cells. Saturation binding experiments were performed by incubating A549 cells with increasing concentrations of radiolabeled peptide in vitro. To test the probe in vivo, nude mice bearing either A549 or OCM-1 derived tumors were established, injected with 99mTc-HYNIC-SWL, and subjected to SPECT imaging. Mice injected with excess unlabeled SWL were used as a specific control. Ex vivo \u03b3-counting of dissected tissues from the mice was also performed to evaluate biodistribution.Immunofluorescence staining showed that A549 cells intensively expressed EphA2, while OCM-1 cells had little expression. 99mTc-HYNIC-SWL displayed high binding affinity with A549 cells (KD\u00a0=\u00a02.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7\u00a0nM). From the SPECT images and the results of the biodistribution study, significantly higher uptake of the tracer was seen in A549 tumors (1.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12 %ID/g) than in OCM-1 tumors (0.43\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20 %ID/g) at 1\u00a0h after injection. Pre-injection with excess unlabeled peptide in A549-bearing nude mice, significantly reduced tumor uptake of the radiolabeled probe (0.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.20 %ID/g) was seen.

In vitro tests on KB cell line showed that the significant amounts of the radioconjugates were associated with cell fractions. In vivo characterization in normal Balb/c mice revealed rapid blood clearance of these radioconjugates and favorable biodistribution profile for [124I]-SIP-folate conjugate over [124I]-SIB-folate conjugate. Biodistribution studies of [124I]-SIP-folate conjugate in nude mice bearing human KB cell line xenografts, demonstrated significant tumor uptake. The uptake in the tumors was blocked by excess injection of folic acid, suggesting a receptor-mediated process.

The peptides were labeled with 177Lu and evaluated in vitro (lipophilicity, serum stability, internalization and binding affinity assays). Biodistribution studies were performed in PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice.The solid-phase synthesis was straightforward with an overall yield ranging from 30% to 35% based on the first Fmoc cleavage. The hydrophilicity increased with spacer length (logD: \u2212\u00a01.95 vs \u2212\u00a02.22 of PEG2 and PEG12 analogs, respectively). There is a tendency of increased serum stability by increasing the spacer length (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a0246\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04 and 584\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020 for PEG2 and PEG6 analogs, respectively) which seems to reverse with the PEG12 analog. The IC50 values are similar with the only significant difference of the PEG12 analog. The 177Lu-labeled PEG4 and PEG6 conjugates showed similar pharmacokinetic with high tumor uptake and excellent tumor-to-kidney ratios (7.8 and 9.7 at 4\u00a0h for the PEG4 and PEG6 derivatives, respectively). The pancreas uptake was relatively high at 1\u00a0h but it shows fast washout (0.46%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02% IA/g and 0.29%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08% IA/g already at 4\u00a0h).Among all the studied analogs the PEG4 and PEG6 showed significantly better properties. The very high tumor-to-non-target organ ratios, in particular tumor-to-kidney ratios, already at early time point will be important in regard to safety concerning kidney toxicity.",

We wanted to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution profile and brain uptake of 18F-labeled TCO ([18F]TCO) to assess its potential for pre-targeted imaging in the brain.We evaluated the in vivo behavior of [18F]TCO via an ex vivo biodistribution study complemented by in vivo \u03bcPET imaging at 5, 30, 60, 90, 120 and 240 min post tracer injection. An in vivo metabolite study was performed at 5 min, 30 min and 120 min post [18F]TCO injection by RP-HPLC analysis of plasma and brain extracts. Incubation with human liver microsomes was performed to further evaluate the metabolite profile of the tracer.\u03bcPET imaging and ex-vivo biodistribution revealed an high initial brain uptake of [18F]TCO (3.8%ID/g at 5 min pi) followed by a washout to 3.0%ID/g at 30 min pi. Subsequently the brain uptake increased again to 3.7%ID/g at 120 min pi followed by a slow washout until 240 min pi (2.9%ID/g). Autoradiography confirmed homogenous brain uptake. On the \u03bcPET images bone uptake became gradually visible after 120 min pi and was clearly visible at 240 min pi. The metabolite study revealed a fast metabolization of [18F]TCO in plasma and brain into three main polar radiometabolites.Although [18F]TCO has previously been described to be a useful tracer for radiolabeling of tetrazine modified targeting molecules, our study indicates that its utility for in vivo chemistry and pre-targeted imaging will be limited. Although [18F]TCO clearly enters the brain, it is quickly metabolized with a non-specific accumulation of radioactivity in the brain and bone.",

This study was aimed at discovery of such a radioligand from a group of CRF1 receptor ligands based on a core 3-(phenylamino)\u2010pyrazin-2(1H)-one scaffold.CRF1 receptor ligands were selected for development as possible PET radioligands based on their binding potency at CRF1 receptors (displacement of [125I]CRF from rat cortical membranes), measured lipophilicity, autoradiographic binding profile in rat and rhesus monkey brain sections, rat biodistribution, and suitability for radiolabeling with carbon-11 or fluorine-18. Two identified candidates (BMS-721313 and BMS-732098) were labeled with fluorine-18. A third candidate (BMS-709460) was labeled with carbon-11 and all three radioligands were evaluated in PET experiments in rhesus monkey. CRF1 receptor density (Bmax) was assessed in rhesus brain cortical and cerebellum membranes with the CRF1 receptor ligand, [3H]BMS-728300.The three ligands selected for development showed high binding affinity (IC50 values, 0.3\u20138\u00a0nM) at CRF1 receptors and moderate lipophilicity (LogD, 2.8\u20134.4). [3H]BMS-728300 and the two 18F-labeled ligands showed region-specific binding in rat and rhesus monkey brain autoradiography, namely higher binding density in the frontal and limbic cortex, and cerebellum than in thalamus and brainstem. CRF1 receptor Bmax in rhesus brain was found to be 50\u2013120 fmol/mg protein across cortical regions and cerebellum. PET experiments in rhesus monkey showed that the radioligands [18F]BMS-721313, [18F]BMS-732098 and [11C]BMS-709460 gave acceptably high brain radioactivity uptake but no indication of the specific binding as seen in vitro.Candidate CRF1 receptor PET radioligands were identified but none proved to be effective for imaging monkey brain CRF1 receptors.

A PET-radioligand for the quantification of BACE-1 would be useful for the understanding of AD.

     "abstract": "Leukemia stem cells (LSCs) are believed to be responsible for initiating and propagating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and for causing relapse after treatment. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) targeting these cells may improve the treatment of AML, but is limited by the low density of target epitopes. Our objective was to study a human polynucleotide kinase/phosphatase (hPNKP) inhibitor that interferes with DNA repair as a radiosensitizer for the Auger electron RIT agent, 111In-NLS-7G3, which recognizes the CD123+/CD131- phenotype uniquely displayed by LSCs.The surviving fraction (SF) of CD123+/CD131- AML-5 cells exposed to 111In-NLS-7G3 (33\u2013266 nmols/L; 0.74\u00a0MBq/\u03bcg) or to \u03b3-radiation (0.25-5\u00a0Gy) was determined by clonogenic assays. The effect of A12B4C3 (25 \u03bcmols/L) combined with 111In-NLS-7G3 (16\u201366 nmols/L) or with \u03b3-radiation (0.25\u20132\u00a0Gy) on the SF of AML-5 cells was assessed. The density of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the nucleus was measured using the \u03b3-H2AX assay. Cellular dosimetry was estimated based on the subcellular distribution of 111In-NLS-7G3 measured by cell fractionation.Binding of 111In-NLS-7G3 to AML-5 cells was reduced by 2.2-fold in the presence of an excess (1\u00a0\u03bcM) of unlabeled NLS-7G3, demonstrating specific binding to the CD123+/CD131- epitope. 111In-NLS-7G3 reduced the SF of AML-5 cells from 86.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.0% at 33 nmols/L to 10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6% at 266 nmols/L. Unlabeled NLS-7G3 had no significant effect on the SF. Treatment of AML-5 cells with \u03b3-radiation reduced the SF from 98.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.9% at 0.25\u00a0Gy to 0.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1% at 5\u00a0Gy. A12B4C3 combined with 111In-NLS-7G3 (16\u201366 nmols/L) enhanced the cytotoxicity up to 1.7-fold compared to treatment with radioimmunoconjugates alone and was associated with a 1.6-fold increase in DNA DSBs in the nucleus. A12B4C3 enhanced the cytotoxicity of \u03b3-radiation (0.25\u20130.5\u00a0Gy) on AML-5 cells by up to 1.5-fold, and DNA DSBs were increased by 1.7-fold. Exposure to 111In-NLS-7G3 (66 nmols/L) delivered up to 0.6\u00a0Gy to AML-5 cells.We conclude that A12B4C3 radiosensitized AML cells to the DNA damaging effects of 111In-NLS-7G3.

In vivo imaging of cathepsin K may provide a method to assess changes in osteoclast numbers in such disease states. To that end, two high-affinity and selective cathepsin K inhibitors were radiolabeled with carbon-11. In vivo microPET imaging studies demonstrated uptake and prolonged retention of radioactivity in actively growing or remodeling bone regions (e.g., distal ulnar, carpal, distal and proximal humeral, distal femur, proximal tibia, tail vertebrae). Uptake into bone could be blocked by pre- or co-injection of unlabeled ligand, supporting a specific and saturable binding mechanism for radiotracer localization.

     "abstract": "Human antimicrobial peptides are of interest for the development of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers as they exhibit desirable characteristics that make them good candidates for targeting vectors. Due to their natural role in the innate immune system they selectively bind to pathogenic bacteria and yeast, whilst remaining minimally immunogenic and cytotoxic to humans. Research into ubiquicidin (UBI)-based tracers has focused on 99mTc as a radionuclide, however, the use of bi-functional chelators such as 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA), in combination with 68Ga as a radionuclide, allows for a simple radiolabeling procedure which is preferable in a clinical setting using PET/CT.The peptides fragments UBI29-41, UBI30-41 were synthesized by standard microwave Fmoc/tert-butyl (tBu)-solid phase synthetic protocols. Characterizations were performed using analytical HPLC and LC/MS. Both NOTA-conjugated peptides were exposed to natGa3\u00a0+; their complexed form was quantified by direct LC/MS injection. This complexation was utilized to testify bacterial and mammalian cell binding potential of fluorophore-linked NOTA-UBI29-41/30-41. 68Ga labeled NOTA-UBI fragments were also tested for competitive interaction to Staphylococcus aureus to proof the binding target. 68Ga was eluted from SnO2- and TiO2-based 68Ge/68Ga generators using fractionated elution and anion exchanged-based post-procession. NOTA-peptide radiolabeling was carried out including optimization of buffer molarity, NOTA-peptide concentration(s), incubation temperature and \u2013duration as well as considering various SPE purification cartridges.Pure UBI29-41, UBI30-41 and NOTA-UBI30-41 were successfully characterized. Both, NOTA-UBI fragments exhibited complexation rates to natGa3\u00a0+\u00a0\u2265\u00a099%. The percentage binding was significantly higher to Staphylococcus aureus bacilli over Mt4 human leucocytes (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05) for NOTA-UBI29-41[Lys(Abz)]\u00a0<\u00a0NOTA-UBI30-41[Lys(Abz)]. Significant lower binding was observed for both 68Ga-labeled NOTA-UBI fragments (P >\u00a00.03) after pre-incubation with excess unlabeled NOTA-UBI. Reproducible 68Ga radiolabeling ranged for 51\u201385% and 46\u201378% for NOTA-UBI29-41 and NOTA-UBI30-41, respectively.Aside from successful peptide syntheses the first ever 68Ga-radiolabeling method is reported for NOTA-UBI fragments. The NOTA-conjugation didn\u2019t compromise the selective and specific interaction with bacterial cells in vitro. Both tracers are warranting prospective imaging of infection with PET/CT.",

Proximity to a cyclotron center outfitted with solid target hardware, or to an isotope generator for the metal of interest is necessary, both of which can introduce significant hurdles in development of less common isotopes. Herein, we describe the production of 44Sc (t1/2\u00a0=\u00a03.97\u00a0h, Eavg,\u03b2+\u00a0=\u00a01.47\u00a0MeV, branching ratio\u00a0=\u00a094.27%) in a solution target and an automated loading system which allows a quick turn-around between different radiometallic isotopes and therefore greatly improves their availability for tracer development. Experimental yields are compared to theoretical calculations.Solutions containing a high concentration (1.44\u20131.55\u00a0g/mL) of natural-abundance calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (Ca(NO3)2\u00a0\u00b7\u00a04 H2O) were irradiated on a 13\u00a0MeV proton-beam cyclotron using a standard liquid target. 44gSc was produced via the 44Ca(p,n)44gSc reaction.44gSc was produced for the first time in a solution target with yields sufficient for early radiochemical studies. Saturation yields of up to 4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0MBq/\u03bcA were achieved using 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3\u00a0\u03bcA proton beams for 60.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2\u00a0minutes (number of runs n\u00a0=\u00a03).

Scandium was isolated from the target mixture via solid-phase extraction with 88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% (n\u00a0=\u00a05) efficiency and successfully used for radiolabelling experiments.

     "abstract": "The increasing use of molecular imaging probes as biomarkers in oncology emphasizes the need for robust and stable methods for quantifying tracer uptake in PET imaging. The primary motivation for this research was to find an accurate method to quantify the total tumor uptake. Therefore we developed a histogram-based method to calculate the background subtracted lesion (BSL) activity and validated BSL by comparing the quantitative consistency with the total lesion glycolysis (TLG) in phantom and patient studies.A thorax phantom and a PET-ACR quality assurance phantom were scanned with increasing FDG concentrations. Volumes of interest (VOIs) were placed over each chamber. TLG was calculated with a fixed threshold at SUV 2.5 (TLG2.5) and a relative threshold at 42% of SUVmax (TLG42%). The histogram for each VOI was built and BSL was calculated. Comparison with the total injected FDG activity (TIA) was performed using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) and the slope (a). Fifty consecutive patients with FDG-avid lung tumors were selected under an IRB waiver. TLG42%, TLG2.5 and BSL were compared to the reference standard calculating CCC and the slope.In both phantoms, the CCC for lesions with a TIA \u2264\u00a050\u00a0ml*SUV between TIA and BSL was higher and the slope closer to 1 (CCC\u00a0=\u00a00.933, a\u00a0=\u00a01.189), than for TLG42% (CCC\u00a0=\u00a00.350, a\u00a0=\u00a00.731) or TLG2.5 (CCC\u00a0=\u00a00.761, a\u00a0=\u00a00.727). In 50 lung lesions BSL had a slope closer to 1 compared to the reference activity than TLG42% (a\u00a0=\u00a01.084 vs 0.618 \u2013 for high activity lesions) and also closer to 1 than TLG2.5 (a\u00a0=\u00a01.117 vs 0.548 \u2013 for low activity lesions).The histogram based BSL correlated better with TIA in both phantom studies than TLG2.5 or TLG42%.

However, as a result of the pharmacokinetics of [18F]FMISO a 2\u00a0h wait between tracer administration and patient scanning is required for optimal image acquisition. In order to develop hypoxia imaging agents with faster kinetics, we have synthesised and evaluated several F-18 labelled anilino sulfoxides. In this manuscript we report on the synthesis, in vitro and in vivo evaluation of a novel fluoroethyltriazolyl propargyl anilino sulfoxide. The radiolabelling of the novel tracer was achieved via 2-[18F]fluoroethyl azide click chemistry. Radiochemical yields were 23\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% based on 2-[18F]fluoroethyl azide and 7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02% based on K[18F]F. The radiotracer did not undergo metabolism or defluorination in an in vitro assay using S9 liver fractions. Imaging studies using SK-RC-52 tumors in BALB/c nude mice have indicated that the tracer may have a higher pO2 threshold than [18F]FMISO for uptake in hypoxic tumors. Although clearance from muscle was faster than [18F]FMISO, uptake in hypoxic tumors was slower. The average tumor to muscle ratio at 2\u00a0h post injection in large, hypoxic tumors with a volume greater than 686\u00a0mm3 was 1.7, which was similar to the observed ratio of 1.75 for [18F]FMISO. Although the new tracer showed improved pharmacokinetics when compared with the previously synthesised sulfoxides, further modifications to the chemical structure need to be made in order to offer significant in vivo imaging advantages over [18F]FMISO.",

This paper aims to describe the whole-body biodistribution and dosimetry estimates of [18F]MNI-698.Whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) images were acquired over 240\u00a0minutes after intravenous bolus injection of [18F]MNI-698 in adult rhesus monkeys. Different models were investigated for quantification of radiation absorbed and effective doses using OLINDA/EXM 1.0 software.The radiotracer main elimination route was found to be urinary and the critical organ was the urinary bladder. Modeling of the urinary bladder voiding interval had a considerable effect on the estimated effective dose. Normalization of rhesus monkeys\u2019 organs and whole-body masses to human equivalent reduced the calculated dosimetry values. The effective dose ranged between 0.017 and 0.027\u00a0mSv/MBq.The dosimetry estimates, obtained when normalizing organ and whole-body weights and applying the urinary bladder model, indicate that the radiation doses from [18F]MNI-698 comply with limits and guidelines recommended by key regulatory authorities that govern the translation of radiotracers to human clinical trials.

Clinical and research applications would include assessment of reservoirs, informing clinical management by facilitating assessment of burden of infection in different compartments, monitoring disease progression and monitoring response to therapy. A \u201crational\u201d development approach could facilitate efficient identification of an appropriate targeted radiopharmaceutical. Rational development starts with understanding characteristics of the disease that can be effectively targeted and then engineering radiopharmaceuticals to hone in on an appropriate target, which in the case of HIV-1 (HIV) might be an HIV-specific product on or in the host cell, a differentially expressed gene product, an integrated DNA sequence specific enzymatic activity, part of the inflammatory response, or a combination of these. This is different from the current approach that starts with a radiopharmaceutical for a target associated with a disease, mostly from autopsy studies, without a strong rationale for the potential to impact patient care. At present, no targeted therapies are available for HIV latency, although a number of approaches are under study. Here we discuss requirements for a radiopharmaceutical useful in strategies targeting persistently infected cells. The radiopharmaceutical for HIV should be developed based on HIV biology, studied in an animal model and then in humans, and ultimately used in clinical and research settings.",

     "abstract": "The existing solid target production method of radiometals requires high capital and operational expenditures, which limit the production of radiometals to the small fraction of cyclotron facilities that are equipped with solid target systems. Our objective is to develop a robust solution target method, which can be applicable to a wide array of radiometals and would be simply and easily adopted by existing cyclotron facilities for the routine production of radiometals.We have developed a simplified, solution target approach for production of 89Zr using a niobium target by 14 MeV energy proton bombardment of aqueous solutions of yttrium salts via the 89Y(p,n)89Zr nuclear reaction. The production conditions were optimized, following a detailed mechanistic study of the gas evolution.Although the solution target approach avoided the expense and complication of solid target processing, rapid radiolytic formation of gases in the target represents a major impediment in the success of solution target. To address this challenge we performed a systematic mechanistic study of gas evolution. Gas evolution was found to be predominantly due to decomposition of water to molecular hydrogen and oxygen. The rate of gas evolutions varied >\u00a040-fold depending on solution composition even under the same irradiation condition. With chloride salts, the rate of gas evolution increased in the order rank Na\u00a0<\u00a0Ca\u00a0<\u00a0Y. However, the trend was reversed with the corresponding nitrate salts, and further addition of nitric acid to the irradiating solution minimized gas evolution. At optimized condition, 89Zr was produced in moderate yield (4.36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48 MBq/\u03bcA\u2022h) and high effective specific activity (464\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0215 MBq/\u03bcg) using the solution target approach (2.75\u00a0M yttrium nitrate, 1.5\u00a0N HNO3, 2\u00a0h irradiation at 20\u00a0\u03bcA).The novel findings on substrate dependent, radiation-induced water decomposition provide fundamental data for the development and optimization of conditions for solution targets. The developed methodology of irradiation of nitrate salts in dilute nitric acid solutions can be translated to the production of a wide array of radiometals like 64Cu, 68Ga and 86Y, and is well suited for short-lived isotopes.",

It is highly desirable to further improve the preparation method by developing a simplified one vial formulation which will be labeled in boiling water bath (95\u00a0\u00b0C) for 15\u00a0min and a high labeling yield will be achieved.

The stability of radioconjugate was checked in the presence of human serum at 37\u00a0\u00b0C up to 24\u00a0h.99mTc-TRODAT-1 was prepared with a radiochemical purity of more than 95% and specific activity of 64.3\u00a0MBq/nmol. Biodistribution studies of this new formulation in rats revealed similar regional brain distribution as compared with those obtained with the previous preparation in which brain uptake was high in striatum and striatum to cerebellum ratio was high.

The aim of this study is to compare both images in the same health control (HC) and PD subjects.Eighteen subjects (8 HC and 10 PD) were recruited for 99mTc-TRODAT-1 SPECT, 18\u00a0F-AV-133 PET and MRI scans within two weeks. The SPECT images were performed at 4-h post-injection for 45\u00a0min, and the PET images were performed at 90\u00a0min post-injection for 10\u00a0min. Each PET and SPECT image was normalized into Montreal Neurological Institute template aided from individual MRI for comparison. For regional analysis, volume of interest (VOIs) of bilateral caudate nuclei, anterior, posterior putamen and occipital cortex (as reference region) were delineated from the normalized MRI. The specific uptake ratio (SUR) was calculated as (regional mean counts/reference mean counts\u00a0\u2212\u00a01). The nonparametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used to evaluate the power of differentiating control from PD subjects for both image modalities. The correlations of the SURs to the clinical parameters were examined. For voxelwise analysis, two-sample t-test for group comparison between HC and PD was computed in both image modalities.The SURs of caudate nucleus and putamen correlated well between two image modalities (r\u00a0=\u00a00.81, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and showed significant different between HC and PD subjects.

     "abstract": "The brain serotonin-7 receptor (5-HT7) is the most recently discovered serotonin receptor. It is targeted by several drug-candidates in psychopharmacology and neuropharmacology. In these fields, positron emission tomography (PET) is a molecular imaging modality offering great promise for accelerating the development process from preclinical discovery to clinical phases. We recently described fluorinated 5-HT7 radioligands, inspired by the structure of SB269970, the prototypical 5-HT7 antagonist. Although these results were promising, it appeared that the radiotracer-candidates suffered, among other drawbacks, from too low a 5-HT7 receptor affinity.In the present study, seven structural analogs of SB269970 were synthesized using design strategies aiming to improve their radiopharmacological properties. Their 5-HT7 binding properties were investigated by cellular functional assay. The nitro-precursors of the analogs were radiolabeled by [18\u00a0F-]nucleophilic substitution, and in vitro autoradiography was performed in rat brain, followed by in vivo microPET.The chemical and radiochemical purity of the fluorine radiotracers was\u00a0>\u00a099% with specific activity in the 40\u2013129\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol range. The seven derivatives presented heterogeneous binding affinities toward 5-HT7 and 5-HT1A receptors. While [18\u00a0F]2F3P3 had promising characteristics in vitro, it showed poor brain penetration in vivo, partially reversed after pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein.These results indicated that, while chemical modification of these series improved several radiotracer-candidates in terms of 5-HT7 receptor affinity and specificity toward 5-HT1A receptors, other physicochemical modulations would be required in order to increase brain penetration.",

However, the mechanisms of human hepatic uptake and bile excretion transport of 99mTc-PMT have not been determined. We thus investigated the transport mechanisms of human hepatic uptake and bile excretion in hepatobiliary scintigraphy with 99mTc-PMT.Four solute carrier (SLC) transporters involved in hepatic uptake were evaluated using human embryonic kidney (HEK) and HeLa cells with high expression of SLC transporters (organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, organic anion transporters (OAT)2 and organic cation transporters (OCT)1) after 5\u00a0min of 99mTc-PMT incubation. Metabolic analysis of 99mTc-PMT was performed using pooled human liver S9. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette (ABC) transporters for bile excretion were examined using hepatic ABC transporter vesicles human expressing multiple drug resistance 1 (MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2), breast cancer resistance protein or bile salt export pump. 99mTc-PMT was incubated for 1, 3 and 5\u00a0min with ATP or adenosine monophosphate and these vesicles. SPECT scans were performed in normal and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic (EHBR) model rats, deficient in Mrp2 transporters, without and with verapamil (rat Mdr1 and human MDR1 inhibitor) after intravenous injection of 99mTc-PMT.Uptake of 99mTc-PMT in HEK293/OATP1B1 and HeLa/OATP1B3 was significantly higher than that in HEK293- and HeLa-mock cells. 99mTc-PMT was not metabolized in the human liver S9. In vesicles with high expression of ABC transporters, uptake of MDR1 or MRP2 was significantly higher at all incubation times. Bile excretion of 99mTc-PMT was also identified by comparison between normal and EHBR rats with and without verapamil on in-vivo imaging.Human hepatic uptake of 99mTc-PMT was transferred by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, and excretion into bile canaliculi via MDR1 and MRP2. 99mTc-PMT hepatobiliary scintigraphy may be a useful ligand as a noninvasive method of visualizing and quantifying hepatobiliary transporter functionality, which could predict drug pharmacokinetics.",

Regions-of-interest were defined on individuals\u2019 MRIs and transferred to the co-registered PET images. Data were analyzed using Logan graphical analysis with metabolite-corrected input function, the simplified reference tissue model (SRTM) method and occupancy plots.

Specific binding of the tracer was localized to the striatum and globus pallidus (GP) and low in other brain regions. Thalamus was used as the reference tissue to derive binding potentials (BPND). The BPND for caudate, putamen, and GP were 0.23, 0.65, 0.51, respectively by the graphical method, and 0.42, 0.76, and 0.75 from the SRTM method. A dose dependent decrease of BPND was observed with the pre-treatment of a PDE10A inhibitor. A bolus plus infusion injection paradigm yielded similar results.[11C]AMG 7980 has been successfully used for imaging PDE10A in non-human primate brain.

However, some steps in the synthesis of the precursor appeared to be problematic producing low yields. Here, we report on an optimized method for synthesis of the precursor and production of [18\u00a0F]FEL; we also describe [18\u00a0F]FEL\u2019s formulation and stability.Acetylation of d-lactose 1 was performed following a literature procedure to obtain 1\u2032,2\u2032,3\u2032,6\u2032,2,3,4,6-d-lactose octa-acetate 2a/2b.

Unfortunately, liver transplantation remains not easily available because of organ shortage and imposes inherent risks and lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore alternative treatments are required. Hepatocytes transplantation and its limitations led to consider innovative alternative such as transplantation of adult derived human liver stem cells (ADLHSC). These cells present high proliferative capacity, good resistance to cryopreservation and ability to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells displaying mature hepatocyte functions.Biodistribution of ADHLSC had never been assessed after infusion through the portal vein in patients. This information is required to determine the safety of the method.ADHLSC were efficiently labelled with 111-Indium DTPA radiotracer and SPECT imaging was used for the acquisition of whole body imaging to document short term biodistribution of ADHLSC.Following infusion through the portal vein, ADHLSC diffused homogenously throughout the liver and remained strictly within the targeted organ. Images were acquired until 5 days after infusion. At that time, no signal was observed in any other organs except the liver. Urinary excretion of 111-Indium DTPA was also monitored.For the first time, we documented the short term biodistribution of ADHLSC within the liver after infusion through the portal vein.",

[18\u00a0F]FECNT has been used extensively in the quantification of DAT occupancy in non-human primate brain and can distinguish between Parkinson's and healthy controls in humans. The purpose of this work was to develop a compartment model to characterize the kinetics of [18\u00a0F]FECNT for quantification of DAT density in healthy human brain.Twelve healthy volunteers underwent 180\u00a0min dynamic [18\u00a0F]FECNT PET imaging including sampling of arterial blood. Regional time-activity curves were extracted from the caudate, putamen and midbrain including a reference region placed in the cerebellum. Binding potential, BPND, was calculated for all regions using kinetic parameters estimated from compartmental and Logan graphical model fits to the time-activity data. Simulations were performed to determine whether the compartment model could reliably fit time-activity data over a range of BPND values.The kinetics of [18\u00a0F]FECNT were well-described by the reversible 2-tissue arterial input and full reference tissue compartment models. Calculated binding potentials in the caudate, putamen and midbrain were in good agreement between the arterial input model, reference tissue model and the Logan graphical model. The distribution volume in the cerebellum did not reach a plateau over the duration of the study, which may be a result of non-specific binding in the cerebellum. Simulations that included non-specific binding show that the reference and arterial input models are able to estimate BPND for DAT densities well below that observed in normal volunteers.The kinetics of [18\u00a0F]FECNT in human brain are well-described by arterial input and reference tissue compartment models. Measured and simulated data show that BPND calculated with reference tissue model is proportional to BPND calculated from the arterial input model.",

We evaluated two in vitro selective fluorine-18-labeled radioligand candidates ([18F]5 and [18F]6) for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of D3 receptor availability in the brain.Biodistribution was evaluated in Sprague\u2013Dawley rats using ex vivo autoradiography and small-animal PET. Protein binding studies were conducted in human plasma and cerebrospinal fluid.[18F]5 showed rapid blood\u2013brain barrier penetration and fast washout after intravenous injection, whereas the rat brain penetration of [18F]6 was lower. The total distribution volume (VT) of [18F]5 was 20\u201326\u00a0mL g\u2212\u00a01 throughout brain. Co-injection with the D3 antagonist BP897 resulted in globally increased cerebral washout of [18F]5 and [18F]6, but SUV analysis and parametric mapping of binding potential (BPND) relative to the cerebellum did not reveal specific binding of either ligand in D3-rich brain regions, i.e. the ventral striatum. However, there was substantial displaceable binding of [18F]5, and to a lesser extent [18F]6, in the pituitary.These radioligands reveal dopamine D3 receptors in the pituitary, but are not suitable for PET imaging of in brain, possibly due to low specific signal relative to the globally high VT.",

We previously generated single-chain antibodies (scFv) against ligand-induced binding sites (LIBS) on the highly abundant platelet glycoprotein integrin receptor IIb/IIIa.

Radiolabeled scFv was incubated with in vitro formed platelet clots and injected into mice with FeCl3 induced thrombus in the left carotid artery. Clots were imaged in the PET scanner and amount of radioactivity measured using an ionization chamber and image analysis. Assessment of vessel injury as well as the biodistribution of the radiolabeled scFv was studied.After incubation with increasing concentrations of 18F-scFvanti-LIBS clots had retained significantly higher amounts of radioactivity compared to clots incubated with radiolabeled 18F-mut-scFv (13.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 vs. 3.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 KBq, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, n\u00a0=\u00a09, decay corrected).

The animals were killed 24\u00a0h after injection followed by excision of the kidneys. The absorbed dose to the kidneys ranged between 0.13 and 13\u00a0Gy. Total RNA was extracted from separated renal tissue samples, and applied to Illumina MouseRef-8 Whole-Genome Expression Beadchips to identify regulated transcripts after irradiation. Nexus Expression 2.0 and Gene Ontology terms were used for data processing and to determine affected biological processes.Distinct transcriptional responses were observed following 177Lu-octreotate administration. A higher number of differentially expressed transcripts were observed in the kidney medulla (480) compared to cortex (281). In addition, 39 transcripts were regulated at all absorbed dose levels in the medulla, compared to 32 in the cortex. Three biological processes in the cortex and five in the medulla were also shared by all absorbed dose levels. Strong association to metabolism was found among the affected processes in both tissues. Furthermore, an association with cellular and developmental processes was prominent in kidney medulla, while transport and immune response were prominent in kidney cortex.Specific biological and dose-dependent responses were observed in both tissues. The number of affected transcripts and biological processes revealed distinct response differences between the absorbed doses delivered to the tissues.",

The goal of this work was to evaluate Al18F-NODA-butyric acid (Al18F-1) as a potential PET tracer to image the kidneys and monitor renal function by comparing its pharmacokinetic properties with those of 131I-o-iodohippurate (131I-OIH), the radioactive standard for the measurement of effective renal plasma flow.Al18F-1 was prepared in aqueous conditions using a one-pot Al18F-radiofluorination method and its radiochemical purity was determined by HPLC. Biodistribution studies, using 131I-OIH as an internal control, were performed in normal rats and in rats with renal pedicle ligation. In vitro stability and metabolism of Al18F-1 were analyzed by HPLC. Dynamic microPET/CT studies were conducted in normal rats.Al18F-1 showed excellent stability in vitro and in vivo. Biodistribution studies in normal rats and in rats with simulated renal failure confirmed that Al18F-1 was exclusively cleared through the renal\u2013urinary pathway and that the hepatic/gastrointestinal activity was less for Al18F-1 than for 131I-OIH both at 10 and 60\u00a0min. Dynamic PET showed a rapid transit of Al18F-1 through the kidneys into the bladder.These results suggest that the easily labeled Al18F-based compounds provide a highly promising approach for the development of a PET renal radiotracer that combines superior imaging qualities with a reliable measure of effective renal plasma flow.",

A 4-fold increase of FDG uptake in PC3 cells (15.11% vs. 3.94%/106 cells) was observed in media with 1.0\u00a0mM palmitate compared to media with no palmitate. The same tendency was observed in PC3 and CWR22Rv1 cells after 2\u00a0h incubation. In glucose-free media no significant differences in FDG uptake after 24\u00a0h incubation were observed. The significant differences after 2\u00a0h incubation all pointed in the direction of increased FDG uptake when palmitate was added. Acetate uptake in PC3 cells was significantly lower when palmitate was added in glucose-free DMEM. No clear tendency when comparing FDG or acetate uptake in the same media at different time points of incubation was observed.Our results indicate a FFA dependent metabolic boost/switch of glucose uptake in PCa, with patterns reflecting the true heterogeneity of the disease.",

The purpose of this study was to synthesize and evaluate the efficacy of a 68Ga-labeled NGR peptide as a new molecular probe that binds to APN.NGR peptide was conjugated with 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N\u2019,N\u201d,N\u201d\u2019-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) and labeled with 68Ga at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 10\u00a0min. In vitro uptake and binding analysis was performed with A549 and MDA-MB231 cells. Biodistribution of 68Ga-DOTA-NGR was determined in normal mice by dissection method. 68Ga-DOTA-NGR PET was performed in A549 and MDA-MB231 xenografts, and included dynamic and static imaging. APN expression in tumors and new vasculatures was analyzed by immunohistochemistry.The radiochemical purity of 68Ga-DOTA-NGR was 98.0%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4% with a specific activity of about 17.49\u00a0MBq/nmol. The uptake of 68Ga-DOTA-NGR in A549 cells increased with longer incubation times, and could be blocked by cold DOTA-NGR, while no specific uptake was found in MDA-MB231 cells. In vivo biodistribution studies showed that 68Ga-DOTA-NGR was mainly excreted from the kidney, and rapidly cleared from blood and nonspecific organs. MicroPET imaging showed that high focal accumulation had occurred in the tumor site at 1\u00a0h post-injection (pi) in A549 tumor xenografts. A significant reduction of tumor uptake was observed following coinjection with a blocking dose of DOTA-NGR, whereas only mild uptake was found in MDA-MB231 tumor xenografts. Tumor uptake, measured as the tumor/lung ratio, increased with time peaking at 12.58\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.26 at 1.5\u00a0h pi. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed that APN was overexpressed on A549 cells and neovasculature.68Ga-DOTA-NGR was easily synthesized and showed favorable biodistribution and kinetics. 68Ga-DOTA-NGR could also specifically bind to the APN receptor in vitro and in vivo, and might be a potential molecular probe for the noninvasive detection of APN-positive tumors and neovasculature.",

In this study we investigated the efficacy of 6D2 antibody radiolabeled with two other longer lived \u03b2 emitters 90Y and 166Ho in treatment of experimental melanoma, with the objective to find a possible correlation between the efficacy and half-life of the radioisotopes which possess high energy \u03b2 (Emax\u00a0>\u00a01.5\u00a0MeV) emission properties.6D2 was radiolabeled with longer lived \u03b2 emitters 90Y and 166Ho in treatment of experimental melanoma in A2058 melanoma tumor-bearing nude mice. The immunoreactivity of the radiolabeled 6D2 mAb, its in vitro binding to the MNT1 human melanoma cells, the biodistribution and therapy in A2058 human melanoma bearing nude mice as well as dosimetry calculations were performed.When labeled with the longer lived 90Y radionuclide, the 6D2 mAb did not produce any therapeutic effect in tumor bearing mice while the reduction of the tumor growth by 166Ho-6D2 was very similar to the previously reported therapy results for 188Re-6D2. In addition, 166Ho-labeled mAb produced the therapeutic effect on the tumor without any toxic effects while the administration of the 90Y-labeled radioconjugate was toxic to mice with no appreciable anti-tumor effect.166Ho-labeled mAb to melanin produced some therapeutic effect on the tumor without any toxic effects while the administration of the 90Y-labeled radioconjugate was toxic to mice with no appreciable anti-tumor effect. We concluded that the serum half-life of the 6D2 carrier antibody matched well the physical half-life of 166Ho to deliver the tumoricidal absorbed dose to the tumor.

In preparation of using this tracer in humans, as a new promising method to distinguish between indolent and aggressive cancers, we have performed PET studies in mice to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution and estimate human dosimetry of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105.Five mice received iv tail injection of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 and were PET/CT scanned 1, 4.5 and 22\u00a0h post injection. Volume-of-interest (VOI) were manually drawn on the following organs: heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen, intestine, muscle, bone and bladder. The activity concentrations in the mentioned organs [%ID/g] were used for the dosimetry calculation. The %ID/g of each organ at 1, 4.5 and 22\u00a0h was scaled to human value based on a difference between organ and body weights. The scaled values were then exported to OLINDA software for computation of the human absorbed doses. The residence times as well as effective dose equivalent for male and female could be obtained for each organ. To validate this approach, of human projection using mouse data, five mice received iv tail injection of another 64Cu-DOTA peptide-based tracer, 64Cu-DOTA-TATE, and underwent same procedure as just described. The human dosimetry estimates were then compared with observed human dosimetry estimate recently found in a first-in-man study using 64Cu-DOTA-TATE.Human estimates of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 revealed the heart wall to receive the highest dose (0.0918\u00a0mSv/MBq) followed by the liver (0.0815\u00a0mSv/MBq), All other organs/tissue were estimated to receive doses in the range of 0.02\u20130.04\u00a0mSv/MBq. The mean effective whole-body dose of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105 was estimated to be 0.0317\u00a0mSv/MBq. Relatively good correlation between human predicted and observed dosimetry estimates for 64Cu-DOTA-TATE was found. Importantly, the effective whole body dose was predicted with very high precision (predicted value: 0.0252\u00a0mSv/Mbq, Observed value: 0.0315\u00a0mSv/MBq) thus validating our approach for human dosimetry estimation.Favorable dosimetry estimates together with previously reported uPAR PET data fully support human testing of 64Cu-DOTA-AE105.",

Interactions were measured using time-resolved assays on living cells, and further analyzed with Interaction Map\u00ae.Results demonstrated a general biphasic appearance of a high- and a low-affinity binding event in all cases. The relative contribution from these two interactions differed between conjugates. For 125I-Fab, the population of low-affinity binders could be significantly increased by extending the chloramine T exposure during labeling, whereas the 111In-labeling predominantly resulted in a high-affinity interaction. Interactions were also shown to be cell line dependent, with e.g. SCC-25 cells generally mediating a faster dissociation of conjugates compared to the other cell lines.In conclusion, we report both cell line dependent and labeling associated variations in interaction kinetics for AbD15179 binding to CD44v6. This has implications for cell-based kinetic assays and applications based on labeled conjugates in general, as well as in a clinical setting, where each individual tumor may create different kinetic profiles for the same conjugate.",

The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the utility of 3\u2032-[18F]fluoro-3\u2032-deoxythymidine (FLT) and 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) for assessment of tumor response to the multi-targeted Aurora B kinase inhibitor, TAK-901.Balb/c nude mice bearing HCT116 colorectal xenografts were treated with up to 30\u00a0mg/kg TAK 901 or vehicle intravenously twice daily for two days on a weekly cycle. Tumor growth was monitored by calliper measurements and PET imaging was performed at baseline, day 4, 8, 11 and 15. Tumors were harvested at time points corresponding to days of PET imaging for analysis of ex vivo markers of cell proliferation and metabolism together with markers of Aurora B kinase inhibition including phospho-histone H3 (pHH3) and senescence associated \u03b2-galactosidase.Tumor growth was inhibited by 60% on day 12 of 30\u00a0mg/kg TAK-901 therapy. FLT uptake was significantly reduced by day 4 of treatment and this corresponded with reduction in bromodeoxyuridine and pHH3 staining by immunohistochemistry. All biomarkers rebounded towards baseline levels by the commencement of the next treatment cycle, consistent with release of Aurora B kinase suppression. TAK-901 therapy had no impact on glucose metabolism as assessed by FDG uptake and GLUT1 staining by immunohistochemistry.FLT-PET, but not FDG-PET, is a robust non-invasive imaging biomarker of early HCT116 tumor response to the on-target effects of the multi-targeted Aurora B kinase inhibitor, TAK-901.This is the first report to demonstrate the impact of the multi-targeted Aurora B kinase inhibitor, TAK-901 on tumor FLT uptake. The findings provide a strong rationale for the evaluation of FLT-PET as an early biomarker of tumor response in the early phase clinical development of this compound.",

The GFP expression of Bac-GFP-infected rat islets was observed in vitro by fluorescence microscopy. Iodine uptake and inhibition of iodine uptake by NaClO4 in Bac-NIS-infected islets were dynamically monitored in vitro. Bac-GFP- or Bac-NIS-infected islets were implanted into the left axillary cavity of NOD-SCID mice, and fluorescence imaging and 125I NanoSPECT/CT imaging were subsequently performed in vivo.Bac-GFP efficiently infected rat islets (over 95% infected at MOI\u00a0=\u00a040), and the expression of GFP lasted approximately two weeks. NaClO4 could inhibit iodine uptake by Bac-NIS-infected islets. In vivo imaging revealed that the fluorescence intensity of the transplant sites in Bac-GFP-infected groups was significantly higher than in the non-infected group. Grafts could be clearly observed by 125I NanoSPECT/CT imaging for up to 8 h.Baculovirus vectors are powerful vehicles for studying rat islets in gene delivery.

Our objective was to perform preliminary biological characterization of 64Cu-labeled AS1411 in vitro and in vivo.Four chelators (DOTA, CB-TE2A, DOTA-Bn and NOTA-Bn) were selected to label AS1411 with Cu-64. 185\u00a0kBq (5\u00a0\u03bcCi) of each tracer was incubated in each well with H460 cells at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48\u00a0h, respectively (n\u00a0=\u00a04). For microPET/CT imaging, 7.4\u00a0MBq (200\u00a0\u03bcCi) of AS1411 labeled with either 64Cu-DOTA or 64Cu-CB-TE2A was I.V. injected and multiple scans were obtained at 1, 3, 6 and 24\u00a0h post injection. Afterward in vivo biodistribution studies were performed.Percent uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-AS1411 and 64Cu-CB-TE2A-AS1411 was significantly higher than that of 64Cu-DOTA-Bn-AS1411 and 64Cu-NOTA-Bn-AS1411. About 90% of uptake for 64Cu-DOTA-AS1411 and 64Cu-CB-TE2A-AS1411 was internalized into cells within 3\u00a0h and the internalization process was completed before 24\u00a0h. Both tracers demonstrated reasonable in vivo stability and high binding affinity to the cells. MicroPET imaging with 64Cu-CB-TE2A-AS1411 showed clear tumor uptake at both legs from 1 to 24\u00a0h post injection, whereas both tumors were undetectable for up to 24\u00a0h with 64Cu-DOTA-AS1411. In addition, 64Cu-CB-TE2A-AS1411 had faster in vivo pharmacokinetics than 64Cu-DOTA-AS1411 with lower liver uptake and higher tumor to background contrast.CB-TE2A is a preferred chelator with higher tumor-to-background ratio, lower liver uptake and faster clearance than DOTA. Aptamer imaging with 64Cu-CB-TE2A-AS1411 may be feasible for detecting lung cancer, if an appropriate chelator can be identified and further validation can be performed with a known control oligonucleotide. It may also be used as a companion diagnostic imaging agent for AS1411 in the treatment of cancer.",

     "abstract": "In vivo imaging of GABAA receptors is essential for the comprehension of psychiatric disorders in which the GABAergic system is implicated. Small animal SPECT provides a modality for in vivo imaging of the GABAergic system in rodents using [123I]Iomazenil, an antagonist of the GABAA receptor. The goal of this work is to describe and evaluate different quantitative reference tissue methods that enable reliable binding potential (BP) estimations in the rat brain to be obtained.Five male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were used for [123I]Iomazenil brain SPECT scans. Binding parameters were obtained with a one-tissue compartment model (1TC), a constrained two-tissue compartment model (2TCc), the two-step Simplified Reference Tissue Model (SRTM2), Logan graphical analysis and analysis of delayed-activity images. In addition, we employed factor analysis (FA) to deal with noise in data.BPND obtained with SRTM2, Logan graphical analysis and delayed-activity analysis was highly correlated with BPF values obtained with 2TCc (r\u00a0=\u00a00.954 and 0.945 respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Equally significant correlations were found between values obtained with 2TCc and SRTM2 in raw and FA-denoised images (r\u00a0=\u00a00.961 and 0.909 respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Scans of at least 100\u00a0min are required to obtain stable BPND values from raw images while scans of only 70\u00a0min are sufficient from FA-denoised images. These images are also associated with significantly lower standard errors of 2TCc and SRTM2 BP values.Reference tissue methods such as SRTM2 and Logan graphical analysis can provide equally reliable BPND values from rat brain [123I]Iomazenil SPECT. Acquisitions, however, can be much less time-consuming either with analysis of delayed activity obtained from a 20-minute scan 50\u00a0min after tracer injection or with FA-denoising of images.",

     "abstract": "[11C]Flumazenil has been used to study the GABAA receptor in many preclinical and clinical studies, but the short half-life of carbon-11 means that this molecule is restricted to use by investigators with access to on-site cyclotron and radiosynthesis facilities. The radiosynthesis of [18F]flumazenil has been evaluated by several groups, but the radiochemical yield can be low and inconsistent. We previously reported a series of fluorine-18-labeled imidazobenzodiazepine-based ligands for the GABAA receptor, which had significantly improved radiosynthesis yields. Here we report the in vivo evaluation and comparison of the distribution, metabolism and specificity of the novel ligands in comparison with [18F]flumazenil.In vivo biodistribution studies, at time points up to 90\u00a0min post-injection, were performed in na\u00efve rats to compare the performance of the novel compounds with particular attention paid to regional brain uptake and clearance. In vivo metabolism studies were carried out to determine the percentage of parent compound remaining in the plasma and brain at selected time points. Blocking studies were carried out, using pre-treatment of the test animals with either bretazenil or unlabeled fluorine-19 test compound, to determine the levels of specific and non-specific binding in selected brain regions.Two of the 12 new compounds were rejected due to poor biodistribution showing significant bone uptake. Some of the compounds showed insufficient whole brain uptake or limited evidence of differential binding to GABAA-rich brain regions to warrant further investigation. Four of the compounds were selected for in vivo metabolism and blocking studies. Overall, the studies indicated that two compounds 3 and 5 showed comparable or improved performance compared with [18F]flumazenil, with respect to distribution, metabolic profile and specific binding.These studies have demonstrated that compounds based on [18F]flumazenil, but with alterations to allow improved radiosynthesis, can be prepared which have ideal properties and warrant further evaluation as PET agents for the GABAA receptor. In particular, compounds 3 and 5 show very promising profiles with specific binding and in vivo stability comparable to flumazenil.",

However, there is a lack of radiotracers with suitable biological properties and meeting safety requirements for use in humans.

However, although both FPTC and propranolol inhibited cellular [125I]ICYP binding, FPTC decreased [125I]ICYP uptake by only 25%, whereas propranolol reduced it by 83%. [18\u00a0F]FPTC has the appropriate lipophilicity to penetrate the blood brain barrier (logP +\u00a02.48). The brain uptake reached a maximum within 2\u00a0min after injection of 20\u201325\u00a0MBq [18\u00a0F]FPTC. SUV values ranged from 0.4 to 0.6 and were not reduced by propranolol. Cerebral distribution volume of the tracer (calculated from a Logan plot) was increased rather than decreased after propranolol treatment.\u2018Click chemistry\u2019 was successfully applied to the synthesis of [18\u00a0F]FPTC resulting in high radiochemical yields.

     "abstract": "The selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin is a promising ligand for in vivo brain imaging in rodents. However, [18F]altanserin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in rats. Its applicability might therefore be constrained by both a differential expression of P-gp under pathological conditions, e.g. epilepsy, and its relatively low cerebral uptake. The aim of the present study was therefore twofold: (i) to investigate whether inhibition of multidrug transporters (MDT) is suitable to enhance the cerebral uptake of [18F]altanserin in vivo and (ii) to test different pharmacokinetic, particularly reference tissue-based models for exact quantification of 5-HT2AR densities in the rat brain.Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats, either treated with the MDT inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA, 50\u00a0mg/kg, n\u00a0=\u00a08) or vehicle (n\u00a0=\u00a010) underwent 180-min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Kinetic analyses of tissue time\u2013activity curves (TACs) were performed to validate invasive and non-invasive pharmacokinetic models.CsA application lead to a two- to threefold increase of [18F]altanserin uptake in different brain regions and showed a trend toward higher binding potentials (BPND) of the radioligand.MDT inhibition led to an increased cerebral uptake of [18F]altanserin but did not improve the reliability of BPND as a non-invasive estimate of 5-HT2AR. This finding is most probable caused by the heterogeneous distribution of P-gp in the rat brain and its incomplete blockade in the reference region (cerebellum). Differential MDT expressions in experimental animal models or pathological conditions are therefore likely to influence the applicability of imaging protocols and have to be carefully evaluated.",

     "abstract": "[11C]ABP688 is a promising positron emission tomography (PET) ligand for imaging of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGlu5 receptor). Of the two geometric isomers of ABP688, (E)-ABP688 has a greater affinity towards mGlu5 receptors than (Z)-ABP688. Therefore, a high ratio of E-isomer is required when using [11C]ABP688 as a PET probe for imaging and quantification of mGlu5 receptors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect (Z)-[11C]ABP688 on the synthesis of [11C]ABP688 to be used for binding (E)-[11C]ABP688 in the brain.We synthesized and separated (E)- and (Z)-[11C]ABP688 by purification using an improved preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method equipped with a COSMOSIL Cholester column. We performed an in vitro binding assay in rat brain homogenates and PET studies of the rat brains using (E)- and (Z)-[11C]ABP688.(E)- and (Z)-[11C]ABP688 were successfully obtained with suitable radioactivity for application. In the in vitro assay, the Kd value of (E)-[11C]ABP688 (5.7 nmol/L) was higher than that of (Z)-[11C]ABP688 (140 nmol/L). In the PET study of the rat brain, high radioactivity after injection of (E)-[11C]ABP688 was observed in regions rich in mGlu5 receptors such as the striatum and hippocampus. In contrast, after injection of (Z)-[11C]ABP688, radioactivity did not accumulate in the brain. Furthermore, BPND in the striatum and hippocampus was highly correlated (R2 = 0.99) with the percentage of (E)-[11C]ABP688 of the total radioactivity of (E)- and (Z)-[11C]ABP688 in the injection.We demonstrated that including (Z)-[11C]ABP688 in the [11C]ABP688 injection can decrease BPND in regions rich in mGlu5 receptors. Routine production of (E)-[11C]ABP688 will be helpful for imaging and quantification of mGlu5 receptors in clinical studies.",

In order to find the best suitable chelator for labelling of AMBA, we synthesized AMBA analogues linked to the most commonly used chelators DOTA, NOTA and NODAGA and compared their reactivity and stability after labelling with 68-Gallium.For the synthesis of DO3A-, NO2A- and NODAGA-AMBA, a solid-phase synthesis approach was used. The influence of concentration, pH and temperature on the radiolabelling was analysed. The in vitro stability of all complexes in saline, human serum, human whole blood and against transchelation and transmetallation was analysed.The peptides were synthesised in high yield and purity. Purity and identity of products and impurities were confirmed using UHPLC coupled to ESI-MS. Radiolabelling of these peptides was optimal at elevated temperature, although room temperature labelling was reported previously for NOTA and NODAGA chelators. The highest reactivity was observed for NODAGA-AMBA. On preparation of NO2A-AMBA, the formation of a by-product was detected with HPLC. More detailed analysis revealed the formation of an isomer with the same mass to charge ratio which led to the conclusion that a coordination isomer was formed. All complexes showed high stability in saline, human serum or when challenged with DTPA, transferrin and varying metals (Fe3\u00a0+, Cu2\u00a0+, Zn2\u00a0+). Conversely, the stability in human blood was low, and varying metabolites were detected and identified by ESI-MS.All three precursors are available in high yields suitable for routine production. NODAGA-AMBA showed the most favoured features when labelled with 68-gallium, but a further comparison in vivo should be performed in order to confirm the superior features found in vitro.",

The PNA\u2013peptide conjugate was evaluated in Mec-1 NHL-bearing mice and compared to [177Lu]DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate in biodistribution and excretion studies.

Based on that result, a dosing regimen of 177Lu-PNA\u2013peptide, for radiologic effect, followed by the optimal mass of non-radioactive compound, for antisense effect, was designed. Using that dosing regimen, biodistribution of the PNA\u2013peptide showed uptake in the tumor with minimal washout over a 4-day period. Uptakes in receptor-positive normal organs were low and displayed nearly complete washout by 24\u00a0h. Dosimetry models showed that the tumor absorbed dose of the PNA\u2013peptide conjugate was approximately twice that of the peptide-only conjugate.Biodistribution data showed specific tumor targeting of the 177Lu-labeled PNA\u2013peptide compound with minimal receptor-positive normal tissue uptake when compared to [177Lu]DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate.

     "abstract": "Incorporation of fluorine-18 (18F) into radiotracers by capturing ionic [18F]-species can greatly accelerate and simplify radiolabeling for this important positron emission tomography (PET) radioisotope. Among the different strategies, the incorporation of aluminum [18F]fluoride (Al[18F]2\u00a0+) into NOTA chelators has recently emerged as a robust approach to peptide radiolabeling. This study presents Al[18F]2\u00a0+-radiolabeling of an \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin-targeted peptide (NOTA-PEG28-A20FMDV2) and its in vitro and in vivo evaluation.Aluminum [18F]fluoride was prepared at r.t. from [18F]fluoride (40 MBq\u201311 GBq) and introduced into NOTA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (1) in sodium acetate (pH 4.1; 100\u00b0C, 15 min). The radiotracer Al[18F] NOTA-PEG28-A20FMDV2 (2) was purified by HPLC, formulated in PBS and evaluated in vitro (stability; binding and internalization in \u03b1v\u03b26(+) and \u03b1v\u03b26(\u2212) cells) and in vivo (paired \u03b1v\u03b26(+) and \u03b1v\u03b26(\u2212) xenograft mice: PET/CT, biodistribution, tumor autoradiography and metabolites).The radiotracer 2 was prepared in 90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06 min (incl. formulation; n\u00a0=\u00a03) in 19.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4% decay corrected radiochemical yield (radiochemical purity: >\u00a099%; specific activity: 158\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036 GBq/\u03bcmol) and was stable in PBS and serum (2 h).

Human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) binding studies of 68Ga-NODAGA-VEGF121 were performed at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 4\u00a0h. MicroPET imaging followed by biodistribution studies were performed in U87MG tumor-bearing mice injected with 68Ga-NODAGA-VEGF121. Immunofluorescence staining of the tumor tissues was performed to verify VEGFR2 expression.Binding affinity of NODAGA-VEGF121 for VEGFR2 was found to be comparable to that of VEGF121. 68Ga-NODAGA-VEGF121 was prepared in 47.8% yield with specific activity of 3.4\u00a0GBq/mg. 68Ga-NODAGA-VEGF121 was avidly taken up by HAECs with a time-dependent increase from 9.88 %ID at 1\u00a0h to 20.86 %ID at 4\u00a0h. MicroPET imaging of mice demonstrated high liver and spleen uptake with clear visualization of tumor at 1\u00a0h after injection. ROI analysis of tumors revealed 2.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11 %ID/g at 4\u00a0h after injection. In the blocking study, tumor uptake was inhibited by 29% at 4\u00a0h.

We investigated their metabolism in the blood and imaging properties in comparison to FET ([18F]1).Three new [18F]FET derivatives, 2\u20134, were prepared from their corresponding tosylate-precursors through nucleophilic fluorination and subsequent deprotection reactions. In vitro uptake studies were carried out in 9L glioma cancer cell lines. In vitro and in vivo hydrolysis studies were conducted to evaluate the hydrolysis of FET prodrugs in blood and in Fisher 344 rats. Biodistribution and PET imaging studies were then performed in rats bearing 9L tumors.New FET prodrugs were prepared with 3\u201328% decay corrected radiochemical yields, good enantiomeric purity (>\u00a095%) and high radiochemical purity (>\u00a095%). FET-Gly ([18F]2), FET-Ala ([18F]3), and AcFET ([18F]4) exhibited negligible uptake in comparison to the high uptake of FET ([18F]1) in 9L cells. Metabolism studies of FET-Gly ([18F]2), FET-Ala ([18F]3), and AcFET ([18F]4) in rat and human blood showed that FET-Ala ([18F]3) was hydrolyzed to FET ([18F]1) faster than FET-Gly ([18F]2) or AcFET ([18F]4). Most of the FET-Ala (79%) was converted to FET ([18F]1) within 5\u00a0min in blood in vivo. Biodistribution studies demonstrated that FET-Ala ([18F]3) displayed the highest tumor uptake. The tumor-to-background ratios of FET-Ala ([18F]3) and FET ([18F]1) were comparable and appeared to be better than those of FET-Gly ([18F]2) and AcFET ([18F]4). PET imaging studies showed that both FET ([18F]1) and FET-Ala ([18F]3) could visualize tumors effectively, and that they share similar imaging characteristics.FET-Ala ([18F]3) demonstrated promising properties as a prodrug of FET ([18F]1), which could be used in PET imaging of tumor amino acid metabolism.",

Additional therapies enhancing the effect of X-ray irradiation may be beneficial. Antibodies targeting EGFR have been shown to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy. Therefore, we analyzed cytotoxicity of 213Bi-anti-EGFR immunoconjugates in combination with X-ray irradiation.The monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody matuzumab was coupled to CHX-A\u201d-DTPA forming stable complexes with 213Bi. Cytotoxicity of X-ray radiation, of treatment with 213Bi-anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (MAb) or of a combined treatment regimen was assayed using cell proliferation and colony formation assays in UD-SCC5 cells. Key proteins of cell-cycle arrest and cell death were examined by Western blot analysis. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry. DNA double-strand breaks were detected via \u03b3H2AX and quantified using Definiens\u2122 software.Irradiation with X-rays or treatment with 213Bi-anti-EGFR-MAb resulted in median lethal dose (LD50) values of 12\u00a0Gy or 130\u00a0kBq/mL, respectively. Treatment with 37\u00a0kBq/mL of 213Bi-anti-EGFR-MAb or 2\u00a0Gy of X-rays had only little effect on colony formation of UD-SCC5 cells. In contrast, a combined treatment regimen (37\u00a0kBq/mL plus 2\u00a0Gy) significantly decreased colony formation and enhanced the formation of DNA double-strand breaks. As revealed by flow cytometry, radiation treatments caused accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. Both treatment with 213Bi-anti-EGFR immunoconjugates and application of the combined treatment regimen triggered activation of genes of signaling pathways involved in cell-cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis like p21/Waf, GADD45, Puma and Bax, which were only marginally modulated by X-ray irradiation of cells.213Bi-anti-EGFR-MAb enhances cytotoxicity of X-ray irradiation in UD-SCC5 cells most probably due to effective induction of DNA double-strand breaks. Induction of genes involved in cell-cycle arrest and cell death is almost exclusively due to 213Bi-anti-EGFR-MAb and seems to be independent of p53 function.",

As a consequence of different matrices (TiO2, SnO2, polymers) exploited in commercial 68Ge/68Ga-generators, HCl of different concentrations (0.05\u20261.0 M) is used to obtain 68Ga as starting material for automated syntheses. We have developed a purification method which reduces the eluate volume and adjusts the HCl concentration. The method may potentially allow standardization of the eluate composition of different commercial generators prior to labeling. Recently, a cationic purification process has been reported which allows the pre-fixation of 68Ga on a Varian SCX cation exchange cartridge and subsequent elution of 68Ga with acidified NaCl solutions. As part of the development of ready-to-use cassettes for the automated production of 68Ga-CPCR4.2 using a SCINTOMICS GRP module and an iThemba Labs generator that is eluted with 0.6\u20261.0 M HCl, we tested and compared the 68Ga-trapping efficiency of various commercial available cation exchange cartridges, the efficiency of subsequent 68Ga-elution from these cartridges by means of various protocols and the influence of these variations on the labeling efficiency of [68Ga]CPCR4.2, [68Ga]TRAP(RGD)3 and [68Ga]DOTATATE/[68Ga]DOTANOC. Finally, we transferred the optimized method to the automated, cassette based synthesis of [68Ga]CPCR4.2 and the aforementioned peptides. From seven tested cation exchange cartridges, Chromafix PS-H+ gave the best extraction results (>\u00a095%). Moreover, we observed that acidified solutions of 5 M NaCl or 2.5 M CaCl2 can be used for efficient cartridge elution.

     "abstract": "Dysfunction of the cholinergic neurotransmitter system is present in Parkinson\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease related dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, and is thought to contribute to cognitive deficits in these patients. In vivo imaging of the cholinergic system in these diseases may be of value to monitor central cholinergic disturbances and to select cases in which treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors could be beneficial. The muscarinic receptor tracer [123I]iododexetimide, predominantly reflecting M1 receptor binding, may be an appropriate tool for imaging of the cholinergic system by means of SPECT. In this study, we used [123I]iododexetimide to study the effects of a 6-hydroxydopamine lesion (an animal model of Parkinson\u2019s disease) on the muscarinic receptor availability in the rat brain.Rats (n\u00a0=\u00a05) were injected in vivo at 10\u201313\u00a0days after a confirmed unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesion. Muscarinic receptor availability was measured bilaterally in multiple brain areas on storage phosphor images by region of interest analysis.Autoradiography revealed a consistent and statistically significant lower [123I]iododexetimide binding in all examined neocortical areas on the ipsilateral side of the lesion as compared to the contralateral side. In hippocampal and subcortical areas, such asymmetry was not detected.This study suggests that evaluation of muscarinic receptor availability in dopamine depleted brains using [123I]iododexetimide is feasible. We conclude that 6-hydroxydopamine lesions induce a decrease of neocortical muscarinic receptor availability. We hypothesize that this arises from down regulation of muscarinic postsynaptic M1 receptors due to hyperactivation of the cortical cholinergic system in response to dopamine depletion.In rats, dopamine depletion provokes a decrease in neocortical muscarinic receptor availability, which is evaluable by [123I]iododexetimide imaging.This study may further underline the role of a dysregulated muscarinic system in patients with Lewy body disorders.",

The current study used [18F]FEOBV with PET imaging to detect the effect of a highly selective lesion of the pedunculopontine (PPTg) nucleus in rat.After bilateral and selective lesions of the PPTg cholinergic neurons, rats were scanned using [18F]FEOBV, then sacrificed, and their brain tissues collected for immunostaining and quantification of the VAChT.Comparisons with control rats revealed that cholinergic losses can be detected in the brainstem, lateral thalamus, and pallidum by using both in vivo imaging methods with [18F]FEOBV, and ex vivo measurements. In the brainstem PPTg area, significant correlations were observed between in vivo and ex vivo measurements, while this was not the case in the thalamic and pallidal projection sites.These findings support PET imaging with [18F]FEOBV as a reliable in vivo method for the detection of neuronal terminal losses resulting from lesion of the PPTg. Useful applications can be found in the study of neurodegenerative diseases in human, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or dementia with Lewy bodies.",

     "abstract": "Despite the great potential of positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in cardiovascular disease imaging, one of the major limitations is the availability of PET probes with desirable half-lives and reasonable cost. In this report, we hypothesized that lipophilic cationic BODIPY dye could be selectively accumulated in cardiac muscle, possibly for the development of novel PET myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) probes.A 18F-labeled BODIPY dye ([18F]1) was synthesized efficiently through a fluoride exchange reaction catalyzed by the Lewis acid tin chloride (SnCl4). The compound was first evaluated by a cellular uptake assay in vitro, followed by biodistribution and microPET imaging studies in vivo.[18F]1 was obtained in more than 90% labeling yield, with >\u00a098% radiochemical purity. The HEK-293 cellular uptake assay showed that the preferential uptake of [18F]1 could be related to the cell membrane potential. The biodistribution data demonstrated high levels of [18F]1 accumulation in the heart. In the biodistribution study in mice, the radioactivity uptake in the heart, blood, liver and lung was 3.01\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.44, 0.39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09, 0.69\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.07, 1.71\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.27%ID/g, respectively, at 3\u00a0h post-injection (p.i.).

     "abstract": "The differences between two agents often need to be accurately defined in vivo. Usually they are injected respectively into two groups of subjects. However, if the two agents do not interact with each other in vivo, a coinjection would serve the same purpose. We believe some individual differences in biodistribution may be circumvented through this approach by calculating organ level ratios.A model system of MORF/cMORF pretargeting (MORF/cMORF is a complementary pair of DNA analogues) was employed in connection with an on-going tumor therapeutic project. Human LS174T cells were implanted into the flank of severely immuno-compromised NOD-scid IL2rgnull mice. The tumor was confirmed to express TAG-72 antigens. At 16\u00a0days post tumor inoculation, mice received IV 60\u00a0\u03bcg of MORF-conjugated CC49 (an antiTAG-72 antibody), followed 2\u00a0days later by a low-mass-dose IV coinjection containing 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg of 90Y-cMORF and 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg of 99mTc-cMORF. At 3\u00a0h post radioactivity injection, the distribution of 99mTc was imaged on a SPECT/CT camera and then organs were excised and counted for 90Y and 99mTc. Because the two labeled cMORFs do not react or interact with each other in vivo, the two groups of 90Y and 99mTc data enabled a conventional group comparison. In a new effort, 90Y/99mTc ratios were calculated. Student\u2019s t-test and retrospective power analysis were performed for both approaches. In the new approach, the ratios were set at 1 as the null hypothesis.The Student\u2019s t-test in the conventional group approach indicated that the two labeled cMORFs distributed similarly, but significant differences were observed in salivary gland and large intestines. The coinjection-ratio approach certainly did not subvert the results of the conventional approach but revealed subtler differences. The P values were reduced, the powers were increased in most organs, and more significant differences were observed. The increased sensitivity was due to the reduced CV%s (SD/average*100%) of the 90Y/99mTc ratios. Therefore, some individual differences were circumvented and notably the ratio approach differentiated individual differences into ratio-correctable and ratio-uncorrectable.Although the conventional approach is reliable, the coinjection-ratio approach using organ level ratios is more sensitive and therefore is recommended whenever possible. In addition, it differentiates individual differences into \u201ccoinjection correctable\u201d and \u201ccoinjection uncorrectable\u201d.",

     "abstract": "The field of nuclear medicine is reliant on radionuclides for medical imaging procedures and radioimmunotherapy (RIT). The recent shut-downs of key radionuclide producers have highlighted the fragility of the current radionuclide supply network, however. To ensure that nuclear medicine can continue to grow, adding new diagnostic and therapy options to healthcare, novel and reliable production methods are required. Siemens are developing a low-energy, high-current \u2013 up to 10\u00a0MeV and 1\u00a0mA respectively \u2013 accelerator. The capability of this low-cost, compact system for radionuclide production, for use in nuclear medicine procedures, has been considered.The production of three medically important radionuclides \u2013 89Zr, 64Cu, and 103Pd \u2013 has been considered, via the 89Y(p,n), 64Ni(p,n) and 103Rh(p,n) reactions, respectively. Theoretical cross-sections were generated using TALYS and compared to experimental data available from EXFOR. Stopping power values generated by SRIM have been used, with the TALYS-generated excitation functions, to calculate potential yields and isotopic purity in different irradiation regimes.The TALYS excitation functions were found to have a good agreement with the experimental data available from the EXFOR database. It was found that both 89Zr and 64Cu could be produced with high isotopic purity (over 99%), with activity yields suitable for medical diagnostics and therapy, at a proton energy of 10\u00a0MeV. At 10\u00a0MeV, the irradiation of 103Rh produced appreciable quantities of 102Pd, reducing the isotopic purity. A reduction in beam energy to 9.5\u00a0MeV increased the radioisotopic purity to 99% with only a small reduction in activity yield.This work demonstrates that the low-energy, compact accelerator system under development by Siemens would be capable of providing sufficient quantities of 89Zr, 64Cu, and 103Pd for use in medical diagnostics and therapy. It is suggested that the system could be used to produce many other isotopes currently useful to nuclear medicine.",

A dedicated program has been launched on production of innovative radioisotopes for PET imaging and for \u03b2\u00a0\u2212 and \u03b1 targeted radiotherapy using protons or \u03b1 particles. Since the accelerator is also able to deliver deuteron beams up to 35\u00a0MeV, we have reconsidered the possibility of using them to produce medical isotopes. Indeed, in some cases, the use of deuterons allows higher production yield than protons.186Re is a \u03b2\u00a0\u2212 emitter which has chemical properties close to the widely used 99mTc and has been used in clinical trials for palliation of painful bone metastases resulting from prostate and breast cancer. 186Re production cross section has been measured between 9 and 23\u00a0MeV using the ARRONAX deuteron beam and the stacked-foil technique.A novelty in our work is the use of a monitor foil behind each natW target foil in order to record efficiently the deuteron incident flux and energies all over the stack relying on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recommended cross section of the natTi(d,x)48V reaction. Since a good optimization process is supposed to find the best compromise between production yield and purity of the final product, isotope of interest and contaminants created during irradiation are measured using gamma spectrometry.Our new sets of data are presented and compared with the existing ones and with results given by the TALYS code calculations. The thick target yield (TTY) has been calculated after the fit of our experimental values and compared with the IAEA recommended ones.Presented values are in good agreement with existing data. The deuteron production route is clearly the best choice with a TTY of 7.8\u00a0MB/\u03bcAh at 30\u00a0MeV compared to 2.4\u00a0MBq/\u03bcAh for proton as projectile at the same energy.

This study focuses on the 230U production using the 232Th(d,4n)230Pa(\u03b2\u2212)230U reaction.Experimental cross sections for deuteron-induced reactions on 232Th were measured from 30 down to 19\u00a0MeV using the stacked-foil technique with beams provided by the ARRONAX cyclotron.

Toxicity (animal weight, blood cell counts) and treatment efficacy were studied in animals receiving no treatment, injected with Melphalan alone, RIT alone at day 22 or day 25 (3.7\u00a0MBq of [213Bi]-anti-CD138) and Melphalan combined with alpha-RIT.Fifty percent of untreated mice died by day 63 after MM engraftment.

No animal was cured after Melphalan treatment whereas 60% of the mice survived with RIT alone at day 22 after tumor engraftment with only slight and reversible hematological radiotoxicity. No therapeutic effect was observed with alpha-RIT 25\u00a0days after engraftment. Melphalan and alpha-RIT combination does not improve overall survival compared to RIT alone, and results in increased leukocyte and red blood cell toxicity.Alpha-RIT seems to be a good alternative to Melphalan.

This generator provides a longer-lived daughter for extended PET/CT measurements compared to the chemically similar system 68Ge/68Ga. Scandium also exists as 47Sc, a potential therapeutic radionuclide. It is possible to produce 44Sc in a cyclotron using, for example, the 44Ca (d, n) 44Sc nuclear reaction. In that case, the isomeric state 44mSc (T1/2\u00a0=\u00a058.6\u00a0h) is co-produced and may be used as an in vivo44mSc/44Sc generator. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of this in vivo44mSc/44Sc generator and to demonstrate that the daughter radionuclide stays inside the chelator after decay of the parent radionuclide. Indeed, the physico-chemical process occurring after the primary radioactive decay (EC, IT, Auger electron \u2026) has prevented in many cases the use of in-vivo generator, because of the post-effect as described in the literature.The DOTA macrocyclic ligand forms stable complexes with many cations and has been shown to be the most suitable chelating moiety for scandium. Initially, the radiolabeling of DOTA and a DOTA-peptide (DOTATATE) with Sc was performed and optimized as a function of time, pH, metal-to-ligand ratio and temperature. Next, the physico-chemical processes that could occur after the decay (post-effect) were studied. 44mSc(III)-labeled DOTA-peptide was quantitatively adsorbed on a solid phase matrix through a hydrophobic interaction. Elutions were then performed at regular time intervals using a DTPA solution at various concentrations. Finally, the radiolabelled complex stability was studied in serum.Radiolabeling yields ranged from 90% to 99% for metal-to-ligand ratio ranging from 1:10 to 1:500 for DOTA or DOTATATE respectively. The optimum physico-chemical parameters were pH\u00a0=\u00a04\u20136, t\u00a0=\u00a020\u00a0min, T\u00a0=\u00a070\u00a0\u00b0C. Then, the 44mSc-DOTATATE complex, radiolabeled at 98%, was adsorbed through a hydrophobic interaction to a solid phase. Unlabeled scandium was completely eluted from the column whereas the Sc-DOTATATE complex was 100% retained. The release of 44Sc from the complex due to decay was less than 1% over 2 periods of 44mSc, independent of the DTPA concentration used for elution. 44mSc/44Sc-DOTATATE was stable in serum over 72\u00a0h.The results indicate that the decay of 44mSc to 44Sc does not affect the integrity of the radiolabeled compound. Thus the 44mSc/44Sc generator is chemically valid and stable in serum. It could be used for PET imaging as an in-vivo generator increasing the life time of the scandium and allowing the use of antibody as labelled compound. Further in-vivo biological evaluations should complete this work.",

     "abstract": "Small domain antibodies (sdAbs) present high potential for both molecular in vivo imaging and therapy. Owing to the low molecular weight they are rapidly cleared from blood circulation, and new strategies to extend their half-lifes are needed for therapeutic applications. We have selected a bacterial albumin-binding domain (ABD) from protein Zag to be fused to an anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) single variable-domain heavy-chain region antibody (VHH) to delay blood clearance, and evaluated the biodistribution profile of the fusion protein.The anti-TNF VHH and the fusion protein VHH-Zag were conjugated to S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA). The anti-TNF and albumin-binding properties of the conjugates NOTA-VHH and NOTA-VHH-Zag were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The radioconjugates 67Ga-NOTA-VHH and 67Ga-NOTA-VHH-Zag were obtained by reaction of 67GaCl3 with the corresponding conjugates at room temperature. Biodistribution studies were performed in healthy female CD-1 mice.The immunoreactivity of the VHH-based proteins is preserved upon conjugation to NOTA as well as after radiometallation. The radiochemical purity of the radioconjugates was higher than 95% as determined by ITLC-SG after purification by gel filtration. The biodistribution studies showed that the Zag domain affected the pharmacokinetic properties of VHH, with impressive differences in blood clearance (0.028\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004 vs 1.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 % I.A./g) and total excretion (97.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.6 vs 25.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 % I.A.) for 67Ga-NOTA-VHH and 67Ga-NOTA-VHH-Zag, respectively, at 24\u00a0h p.i.The Zag domain prolonged the circulation time of VHH by reducing the blood clearance of the labeled fusion protein 67Ga-NOTA-VHH-Zag. In this way, the anti-TNF VHH in fusion with the Zag ABD presents a higher therapeutic potential than the unmodified VHH.",

In this work we first developed a new synthetic route to obtain HTE1PA in good yields. Then, we investigated HTE1PA chelation properties towards copper-64 and assessed in vitro and in vivo stability of the resulting compound.Radiolabeling of HTE1PA with copper-64 was tested at different ligand concentrations in ammonium acetate medium. In vitro stability study was carried out by incubating [64Cu]TE1PA complex in human serum at both 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 4\u00a0\u00b0C; chromatographic controls were performed over 24\u00a0h. Biodistribution, pharmacokinetic and hepatic metabolism of [64Cu]TE1PA were conducted in BALC/c mice in comparison with [64Cu]acetate and [64Cu]DOTA, used as a reference ligand.The promising results obtained for natural copper complexation were confirmed. HTE1PA was quantitatively radiolabeled in 15\u00a0min at room temperature. The resulting complex showed high serum stability. [64Cu]TE1PA induced a significant uptake in the liver and kidneys at early biodistribution time point. Nevertheless, a high speed wash out was observed at 24\u00a0h leading to significantly lower uptake into the liver compared to [64Cu]DOTA. The metabolism study was consistent with a high resistance to transchelation as the initial uptake into liver matches with the intact form of [64Cu]TE1PA.Despite the partial elimination of HTE1PA \u2013 as copper-64 complex \u2013 through the hepatic route, its high selectivity for copper and its resistance to transchelation make it a promising ligand for antibody radiolabeling with either copper-64 or copper-67.",

The 155Tb-labeled tumor targeted biomolecules were obtained at a reasonable specific activity and high purity (>\u00a095%). 155Tb gave high quality, high resolution tomographic images.

The relatively long physical half-life of 155Tb matched in particular the biological half-lives of 155Tb-cm09 and 155Tb-DTPA-chCE7 allowing SPECT imaging of KB tumors, IGROV-1 and SKOV-3ip tumors even several days after administration.The radiolanthanide 155Tb may be of particular interest for low-dose SPECT prior to therapy with a therapeutic match such as the \u03b2--emitting radiolanthanides 177Lu, 161Tb, 166Ho, and the pseudo-radiolanthanide 90Y.",

     "abstract": "This paper proposes liposomes as a potential new tool for radioimmunotherapy in solid tumours with a two step targeting system. Tumour pretargeting is obtained by using a monoclonal bispecific antibody (BsmAb, anti CEA x anti-DTPA-In) and pegylated liposomes containing lipid-hapten (DSPE-DTPA-In or DSPE-PEG-DTPA-In). To optimise at the same time in vivo behaviour and specific targeting, the study focuses on the liposome formulation in order to determine more precisely the role of pegylation on both the blood half-life and the specific recognition with the BsmAb.Different liposome formulations containing two PEG length (1000 and 2000) in varying amount (1.5\u20136\u00a0mol%) were prepared with DTPA directly coupled to DSPE or at the end of the PEG chain (DSPE-DTPA or DSPE-PEG-DTPA). Liposomes were immobilized on an L1 chip to measure by SPR (Surface Plasmon Resonance) the effect of pegylation on the BsmAb recognition of the DTPA-In hapten. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in mice. Tumour targeting was studied in nude mice xenografted with human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells that express CEA, and doubly radiolabelled liposomes (with 111In and 125I) injected 24\u00a0h after the BsmAb.The best in vitro apparent dissociation constant was obtained with liposomes bearing DTPA at the end of the PEG chain (KD\u00a0=\u00a06.3 nM), which showed significant specific tumour uptake after BsmAb injection (8.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.4% ID/g at 24\u00a0h versus 4.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5%ID/g for passive targeting, \u03b1\u00a0=\u00a00.01). All tumour/organ ratios were superior to 1 at 24\u00a0h for this formulation, except for the spleen.The feasibility of specific tumour targeting in mice with a BsmAb and radiolabelled liposomes was demonstrated and the interest of SPR to predict their targeting performance in vivo was highlighted.

     "abstract": "Low dose-rate radioimmunotherapy (RIT) using 125I-labelled monoclonal antibodies (125I-mAbs) is associated with unexpected high cytotoxicity per Gy.We investigated whether this hypersensitivity was due to lack of detection of DNA damage by the targeted cells. DNA damage was measured with the alkaline comet assay, gamma-H2AX foci and the micronucleus test in p53\u2212/\u2212 and p53+/+ HCT116 cells exposed to increasing activities of internalizing anti-HER1 125I-mAbs or non-internalizing anti-CEA 125I-mAbs. The expression of proteins involved in radiation response and progression of cells through the cycle were determined.Cell hypersensitivity to low absorbed doses of anti-CEA 125I-mAbs was not due to defect in DNA damage detection, since ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene), gamma-H2AX, p53 and p21 were activated in RIT-treated HCT116 cells and G2/M cell cycle arrest was observed. Moreover, the alkaline comet assay showed that DNA breaks accumulated when cells were placed at 4\u00a0\u00b0C during exposure but were repaired under standard RIT conditions (37\u00a0\u00b0C), suggesting that lesions detected under alkaline conditions (mostly DNA single strand breaks and alkali-labile sites) are efficiently repaired in treated cells. The level of gamma-H2AX protein corroborated by the level of foci measured in nuclei of treated cells was shown to accumulate with time thereby suggesting the continuous presence of DNA double strand breaks. This was accompanied by the formation of micronuclei.Hypersensitivity to non-internalizing 125I-mAbs is not due to lack of detection of DNA damage after low absorbed dose-rates. However, DNA double strand breaks accumulate in cells exposed both to internalizing and non-internalizing 125I-mAbs and lead to micronuclei formation. These results suggest impairment in DNA double strand breaks repair after low absorbed doses of 125I-mAbs.",

To test this hypothesis, we labeled dimeric-cylcoRGD, [c(RGDfK)]2E because a) it is molecularly complex and provides a challenging substrate to test the application of this technique, and b) [c(RGDfK)]2E has already been labeled via several 18F-labeling methods which provide for a preliminary comparison.To validate this labeling method in the context of a complex and clinically relevant tracer to show tumor-specific uptake ex vivo with representative PET images in vivo.An arylborimidine was conjugated to [c(RGDfK)]2E to give the precursor [c(RGDfK)]2E-ArB(dan), which was aliquoted and stored at \u2212\u00a020\u00a0\u00b0C. Aliquots of 10 or 25\u00a0nmol, containing only micrograms of precursor, were labeled using relatively low levels of 18F-activity. Following purification eight mice (pre-blocked/unblocked) with U87M xenograft tumors were injected with [c(RGDfK)]2E-18F-ArBF3\u2212 (n\u00a0=\u00a04) for ex vivo tissue dissection. Two sets of mice (pre-blocked/unblocked) were also imaged with PET\u2013CT (n\u00a0=\u00a02).The [c(RGDfK)]2E-ArB(dan) is converted within 15\u00a0min to [c(RGDfK)]2E-18F-ArBF3\u2212 in isolated radiochemical yields of ~\u00a010% (n\u00a0=\u00a03) at a minimum effective specific activity of 0.3\u00a0Ci/\u03bcmol. Biodistribution shows rapid clearance to the bladder via the kidney resulting in high tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios of >\u00a09 and >\u00a06 respectively while pre-blocking with [c(RGDfK)]2E showed high tumor specificity. PET imaging showed good contrast between tumor and non-target tissues confirming the biodistribution data.An arylborimidine-RGD peptide is rapidly 18F-labeled in one step, in good yield, at useful specific activity. Biodistribution studies with blocking controls show tumor specificity, which is corroborated by PET images.Advances in Knowledge and Implications for patient Care: Despite many antecedent examples of labeled RGD tracers, this work is the first to show direct aqueous labeling of bisRGD with an 18F-ArBF3\u2212. Labeling occurs in near record rapidity (45\u00a0min) at useful effective specific activities and competitive yields for high contrast tumor specific images. As bisRGD has been imaged in humans with several prosthetics, this work suggests potential clinical applications of tracers appended with an 18F-ArBF3\u2212. More generally, the ability to label a molecularly complex tracer suggests that this method could be useful to label many other peptides. Furthermore, these results portend the development of kits that use only microgram quantities of lyophilized precursor for on demand labeling. The ability to perform one-step aqueous labeling in under an hour to provide tracers with high T:NT ratios has important implications for developing radiotracers for use in fundamental research and in preclinical tracer studies.",

The short half-lives of prevailing PET-MPI agents hamper wider clinical application of PET in nuclear cardiology; prompting the development of novel PET-MPI agents. We have previously reported on the potential of radiolabeled ammonium salts, and particularly on that of [11C]dimethyl-diphenyl-ammonium ([11C]DMDPA), for cardiac PET imaging. This study was designed to improve the radiosynthesis and increase the yield of [11C]DMDPA, characterize more meticulously the kinetics of radioactivity distribution after its injection via micro-PET/CT studies, and further explore its potential for PET-MPI.The radiosynthetic procedure of [11C]DMDPA was improved with respect to the previously reported one. The kinetics of radioactivity distribution following injection of [11C]DMDPA were investigated in juvenile and young adult male SD rats using microPET/CT, and compared to those of [13N]NH3. Furthermore, the metabolic fate of [11C]DMDPA in vivo was examined after its injection into rats.Following a radiosynthesis time of 25\u201327\u00a0min, 11.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0GBq of [11C]DMDPA was obtained, with a 43.7%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3% radiochemical yield (n\u00a0=\u00a07). Time activity curves calculated after administration of [11C]DMDPA indicated rapid, high and sustained radioactivity uptake in hearts of both juvenile and young adult rats, having a two-fold higher cardiac radioactivity uptake compared to [13N]NH3. Accordingly, at all time points after injection to both juvenile and young adult rats, image quality of the left ventricle was higher with [11C]DMDPA compared to [13N]NH3. In vivo stability studies of [11C]DMDPA indicate that no radioactive metabolites could be detected in plasma, liver and urine samples of rats up to 20\u00a0min after injection, suggesting that [11C]DMDPA is metabolically stable in vivo.This study further illustrates that [11C]DMDPA holds, at least in part, essential qualities required from a PET-MPI probe. Owing to the improved radiosynthetic procedure reported herein, [11C]DMDPA can be produced in sufficient amounts for clinical use.",

To optimize the labeling, this O-alkylation reaction was evaluated under different temperatures, using different bases and varying amounts of precursor 3. The desired product was obtained after a solid phase extraction (SPE) purification.This two-step radiolabeling reaction successfully produced the desired [18F]FPBM, 1, with an excellent radiochemical purity (>\u00a095%, n\u00a0=\u00a08). Radiochemical yields were between 31% and 39% (decay corrected, total time of labeling: 70\u00a0min, n\u00a0=\u00a08). The SPE purification cannot completely remove pseudo-carriers in the final dose of [18F]FPBM, 1.

The functions of hNIS and HSV1-sr39tk were verified with 125I uptake and 3H-penciclovir (PCV) uptake tests. EGFP and hNIS expression was confirmed with confocal microscopy after immunocytochemical staining. We treated the tumor cells with ANT2 shRNA or GCV or both ANT2 shRNA and GCV and treated the in vivo mouse model with a Huh 7/NTG tumor xenograft. The therapeutic effects of the in vivo study were assessed with caliper measurements and gamma camera imaging using 99mTc-pertechnetate.Huh 7/NTG cells showed a cell number-dependent increase in 125I uptake and a 24-fold higher 3H-PCV uptake compared to parent Huh 7 cells. Huh 7/NTG cells transfected with ANT2 shRNA had lower ANT2 mRNA expression and more impaired proliferation activity than cells transfected with scramble shRNA. Proliferation of Huh 7/NTG cells was also inhibited by GCV treatment. Combined GCV and ANT2 shRNA therapy further inhibited cell proliferation in the in vitro study. The combined therapy with GCV and ANT2 shRNA showed a further decrease in tumor growth in the mouse model.Our results suggest that the combined RNA interference with ANT2 and GCV therapy inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell proliferation more than single GCV therapy or ANT2 shRNA therapy in vitro and in vivo. Therefore it could be applied treating incurable hepatocellular carcinoma.",

     "abstract": "Monitoring the effectiveness of therapy early and accurately continues to be challenging. We hypothesize that determination of Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) mRNA in malignant breast cancer (BC) cells by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, before and after treatment, would reflect therapeutic efficacy.WT4340, a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) 12-mer complementary to HER2 mRNA was synthesized together with -CSKC, a cyclic peptide, which facilitated internalization of the PNA via IGFR expressed on BC cells, and DOTA that chelated Cu-64. Mice (n\u00a0=\u00a08) with BT474 ER\u00a0+/HER2+ human BC received doxorubicin (DOX, 1.5\u00a0mg/kg) i.p. once a week for six weeks. Mice (n\u00a0=\u00a08) without DOX served as controls. All mice were PET imaged with F-18-FDG and 48\u00a0h later with Cu-64-WT4340. PET imaging were performed before and 72\u00a0h after each treatment. Standardized uptake values (SUVs) were determined and percent change calculated. Animal body weight (BW) and tumor volume (TV) were measured.SUVs for Cu-64-WT4340 after DOX treatment declined by 54%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a017% after the second dose, 41%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015% after the fourth dose, and 29%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% after the sixth dose, compared with 42%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022%, 31%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a018%, and 13%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) for F-18-FDG.

     "abstract": "A wide range of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, particularly those related to sleep, are associated with the abnormal function of orexin (OX) receptors. Several orexin receptor antagonists have been reported in recent years, but currently there are no imaging tools to probe the density and function of orexin receptors in vivo. To date there are no published data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) and accumulation of some lead orexin receptor antagonists. Evaluation of CNS pharmacokinetics in the pursuit of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer development could be used to elucidate the association of orexin receptors with diseases and to facilitate the drug discovery and development. To this end, we designed and evaluated carbon-11 labeled compounds based on diazepane orexin receptor antagonists previously described. One of the synthesized compounds, [11C]CW4, showed high brain uptake in rats and further evaluated in non-human primate (NHP) using PET-MR imaging. PET scans performed in a baboon showed appropriate early brain uptake for consideration as a radiotracer. However, [11C]CW4 exhibited fast kinetics and high nonspecific binding, as determined after co-administration of [11C]CW4 and unlabeled CW4. These properties indicate that [11C]CW4 has excellent brain penetrance and could be used as a lead compound for developing new CNS-penetrant PET imaging probes of orexin receptors.",

Radioiodinated antibody fragments with a renal enzyme-cleavable N\u03b5-maleoyl-l-lysyl-glycine (MAL) linkage demonstrated low renal radioactivity levels in mice, from early postinjection times. This study tested the hypothesis whether a 64Cu-labeled NODAGA-exendin-4 peptide with a MAL linkage ([64Cu]NODAGA-MAL-exendin-4) could decrease kidney radioactivity levels in rats, compared to a [64Cu]NODAGA-exendin-4 reference, without impairing the radioactivity levels in the target tissue.NODAGA-MAL-exendin-4 was synthesized in a two-phase approach using solid support to prepare maleoyl-derivatized NODAGA followed by Michael addition to cysteine-derivatized exendin-4 in solution. Radiolabeling was performed in buffered aqua with [64Cu]CuCl2, which was produced via the 64Ni(p,n)64Cu nuclear reaction. The in vitro and in vivo stability, lipophilicity, and distribution kinetics in major rat organs for [64Cu]NODAGA-MAL-exendin-4 were studied and compared to [64Cu]NODAGA-exendin-4. Labeling of pancreatic islets was assessed using autoradiography.NODAGA-MAL-exendin-4 was synthesized, with an overall yield of 9%, and radiolabeled with 64Cu with high specific radioactivity. Serum incubation studies showed high stability for [64Cu]NODAGA-MAL-exendin-4. Similar tissue distribution kinetics was observed for [64Cu]NODAGA-MAL-exendin-4 and [64Cu]NODAGA-exendin-4, with high kidney radioactivity levels.The incorporated MAL linkage in [64Cu]NODAGA-MAL-exendin-4 was unable to reduce kidney radioactivity levels, compared to [64Cu]NODAGA-exendin-4. The applicability of metabolizable linkages in the design of kidney-saving exendin-4 analogs requires further investigation.",

     "abstract": "Chondroitin sulfate (CS) is an endogenous component of extracellular matrix in the cartilage and can be valuable for imaging of cartilage degeneration after radiolabeling. Data monitoring the uptake of 99mTcCS by human cartilage are rare. Radiolabeling was performed by 99mTcO4\u2212/tin method at pH\u00a05.0 in 0.5\u00a0M sodium acetate. For uptake studies human articular cartilage (n\u00a0=\u00a04, 65\u201379a) derived from individuals undergoing knee replacement (pieces of 3\u20135\u00a0mg wet weight), or frozen tissue sections (5\u00a0\u03bc) for autoradiography (10\u00a0\u03bcCi) were used. The uptake was monitored from 10\u00a0min up to 96\u00a0h to achieve saturation. As the commercially available drug Condrosulf (IBSA, Lugano) contains Mg-stearate (0.25%) as additive (to improve its gastrointestinal resorption), we investigated the uptake\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0additive. The washout of the tracer was examined by tissue incubation after uptake experiments (3\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h) with PBS-buffer for 10\u00a0min to 3\u00a0h. Using human articular cartilage the maximal uptake of 99mTcCS (specific activity of 4.1\u20136.1\u00a0Ci/mmol) was continuously increasing with time amounting to a maximum of 53.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2% with additive, versus 39.4%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.3%, without additive, at saturation. Additive increased the resorption of the drug and consecutively its uptake. The washout of the tracer from cartilage after 3\u00a0h uptake amounted to 1.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% with additive, versus 2.6%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5%, without. After 24\u00a0h washout was lower amounting to 1.1%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1% versus 1.75%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.15%, respectively. Autoradiography revealed also a continuous increase in uptake of 99mTcCS with time. After 10\u00a0min of incubation the uptake increase was proportional to the incubation time, reaching the maximum at 48\u201372\u00a0h. Enhanced uptake at the surface (superficial zone) as compared to the subchondral part (deep zone) of slices, was observed. The non-specific uptake in the presence of 50-fold excess of cold CS was time-dependent up to a maximum of 15% (tissue) and 10% (autoradiography), at saturation. The uptake studies indicate, that 99mTcCS accumulates in articular cartilage and prove its chondrotropic effects.",

The resulting tetrac/DOTA-liposomes were labeled with 64Cu at 40 \u00b0C for 1 h and purified using a PD-10 column. 64Cu-DOTA-liposomes were also prepared for comparison. Human aortic endothelial cell (HAEC) binding studies were performed by incubating the liposomes with the cells at 37 \u00b0C. MicroPET imaging followed by tissue distribution study was carried out using U87MG tumor-bearing mice injected with tetrac/64Cu-DOTA-liposomes or 64Cu-DOTA-liposomes.HAEC binding studies exhibited that tetrac/64Cu-DOTA-liposomes were avidly taken up by the cells from 1.02 %ID at 1 h to 11.89 %ID at 24 h, while 64Cu-DOTA-liposomes had low uptake from 0.47 %ID at 1 h to 1.57 %ID at 24 h.

     "abstract": "Bombesin (BBN) and BBN analogues have attracted much attention as high-affinity ligands for selective targeting of the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptor. GRP receptors are overexpressed in a variety of human cancers including prostate cancer. Radiolabeled BBN derivatives are promising diagnostic probes for molecular imaging of GRP receptor-expressing prostate cancer. This study describes the synthesis and radiopharmacological evaluation of various metabolically stabilized fluorobenzoylated bombesin analogues (BBN-1, BBN-2, BBN-3).Three fluorobenzoylated BBN analogues containing an aminovaleric (BBN-1, BBN-2), or an aminooctanoic acid linker (BBN-3) were tested in a competitive binding assay against 125I-[Tyr4]-BBN for their binding potency to the GRP receptor. Intracellular calcium release in human prostate cancer cells (PC3) was measured to determine agonistic or antagonistic profiles of fluorobenzoylated BBN derivatives. Bombesin derivative BBN-2 displayed the highest inhibitory potency toward GRP receptor (IC50\u00a0=\u00a08.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0nM) and was subsequently selected for radiolabeling with fluorine-18 (18F) through acylation with N-succinimidyl-4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB). The radiopharmacological profile of 18F-labeled bombesin [18F]BBN-2 was evaluated in PC3 tumor-bearing NMRI nude mice involving metabolic stability studies, biodistribution experiments and dynamic small-animal PET studies.All fluorobenzoylated BBN derivatives displayed high inhibitory potency toward the GRP receptor (IC50\u00a0=\u00a08.7\u201316.7\u00a0nM), and all compounds exhibited antagonistic profiles as determined in an intracellular calcium release assay. The 18F-labeled BBN analogue [18F]BBN-2 was obtained in 30% decay-corrected radiochemical yield with high radiochemical purity >\u00a095% after semi-preparative HPLC purification. [18F]BBN-2 showed high metabolic stability in vivo with 65% of the radiolabeled peptide remaining intact after 60\u00a0min p.i. in mouse plasma. Biodistribution experiments and dynamic small-animal PET studies demonstrated high tumor uptake of [18F]BBN-2 in PC3 xenografts (2.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.82 %ID/g after 5\u00a0min and 2.45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.25 %ID/g after 60\u00a0min p.i.). Specificity of radiotracer uptake in PC3 tumors was confirmed by blocking experiments.The present study demonstrates that 18F-labeled BBN analogue [18F]BBN-2 is a suitable PET radiotracer with favorable metabolic stability in vivo for molecular imaging of GRP receptor-positive prostate cancer.",

After tumor size reached 150\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0mm3 (day 0), lipo-VNB (5\u00a0mg/kg) was intravenously administered on days 0, 3 and 6.

The expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in tumor during treatment was determined by semiquantitative analysis of immunohistochemical staining.A significant inhibition (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in tumor growth was observed on day 3 after a single dose treatment. The tumor-to-muscle ratio (T/M) derived from [18F]FMAU-PET images of lipo-VNB-treated group declined from 2.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16 to 1.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 after three doses of treatment, while that of the control remained steady.

However, the absence of an 18F-labeled PET myocardial perfusion tracer hampers the widespread use of PET in myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). We recently reported a potential MPI agent based on 18F-labeled rhodamine B. The goal of this study was to more completely define the biological properties of 18F-labeled rhodamine B with respect to uptake and localization in an animal model of myocardial infarction and to evaluate the uptake 18F-labeled rhodamine B by cardiomyocytes.A total of 12 female Sprague Dawley rats with a permanent ligation of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) were studied with small-animal PET. The animals were injected with 100\u2013150\u00a0\u03bcCi of 18F-labeled rhodamine B diethylene glycol ester ([18F]RhoBDEGF) and imaged two days before ligation. The animals were imaged again two to ten days post-ligation. After the post-surgery scans, the animals were euthanized and the hearts were sectioned into 1\u00a0mm slices and myocardial infarct size was determined by phosphorimaging and 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining (TTC). In addition, the uptake of [18F]RhoBDEGF in isolated rat neonatal cardiomyocytes was determined by fluorescence microscopy.Small-animal PET showed intense and uniform uptake of [18F]RhoBDEGF throughout the myocardium in healthy rats. After LAD ligation, well defined perfusion defects were observed in the PET images. The defect size was highly correlated with the infarct size as determined ex vivo by phosphorimaging and TTC staining. In vitro, [18F]RhoBDEGF was rapidly internalized into rat cardiomyocytes with ~\u00a040 % of the initial activity internalized within the 60\u00a0min incubation time. Fluorescence microscopy clearly demonstrated localization of [18F]RhoBDEGF in the mitochondria of rat cardiomyocytes.Fluorine-18-labeled rhodamine B diethylene glycol ester ([18F]RhoBDEGF) provides excellent image quality and clear delineation of myocardial infarcts in a rat infarct model. In vitro studies demonstrate localization of the tracer in the mitochondria of cardiac myocytes. In combination, these results support the continued evaluation of this tracer for the PET assessment of myocardial perfusion.",

There is some evidence in literature that verapamil inhibits two other ABC transporters expressed at the BBB, i.e. multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). However, previous data were obtained with micromolar concentrations of verapamil and do not necessarily reflect the transporter selectivity of verapamil at nanomolar concentrations, which are relevant for PET experiments. The aim of this study was to assess the selectivity of verapamil, in nanomolar concentrations, for Pgp over MRP1 and BCRP.Concentration equilibrium transport assays were performed with [3H]verapamil (5\u00a0nM) in cell lines expressing murine or human Pgp, human MRP1, and murine Bcrp1 or human BCRP.

Biodistribution and ex vivo autoradiography studies were carried out in rats. In vivo competition experiments were evaluated to determine the SERT selectivity of [125I]4 vs. [125I]IDAM ([125I]1).In vitro binding studies of 4 showed excellent binding affinity (Ki,SERT\u00a0=\u00a00.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05\u00a0nM) and excellent selectivity over the other monoamine transporters (100 fold and >\u00a04000 fold for NET and DAT respectively). Scatchard analysis of saturation binding of [125I]4 to rat cortical homogenates gave a Kd value of 0.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09\u00a0nM and a Bmax value of 801.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058.08\u00a0fmol/mg protein. The biodistribution study showed rapid high brain uptake (3.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11% dose/organ at 2\u00a0min) and a good target to non-target ratio (hypothalamus to cerebellum) at 30\u00a0min (2.62) compared to [125I]1 (2.19). Ex vivo autoradiography showed that FlipIDAM localizes in accordance with SERT distribution patterns in the brain. In vivo and ex vivo competition experiments with specific and non-specific SERT compounds also showed that [125I]4 binds specifically to SERT rich regions.The biological evaluation of [125I]4 demonstrates that [123I]4 would be a good candidate for SPECT imaging of SERT.",

     "abstract": "[18F]Fallypride, a fluorinated and substituted benzamide with high affinity for D2/D3 receptors, is a useful PET radioligand for the study of striatal/extrastriatal areas. Since [18F]fallypride is extensively metabolized in vivo and since PET examinations are long lasting in humans, the rapid measurement of the unchanged radiotracer in plasma is essential for the quantification of images. The present study aims: i) to evaluate if the radiometabolites of [18F]fallypride cross the blood\u2013brain barrier in rodents, ii) to identify these radiometabolites in baboon plasma and iii) to develop a rapid solid phase extraction method (SPE) suitable for human applications to quantify both [18F]fallypride and its radiometabolites in plasma.The metabolites P450-dependant in rat and human liver microsomes were characterized by LC\u2013MS\u2013MS and compared to those detected in vivo. Sequential solvent elution on Oasis\u00ae-MCX-SPE cartridges was used to quantify [18F]fallypride and its radiometabolites.In rat microsomal incubations, five metabolites generated upon N/O-dealkylation or hydroxylation at the pyrrolidine and/or at the benzamide moiety were identified. No radiometabolite was detected in the rat brain. N-dealkylated and hydroxylated derivatives were detected in human microsomal incubations as well as in baboon plasma. The use of SPE (total recovery 100.2%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.8%, extraction yield 95.5%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3%) allowed a complete separation of [18F]fallypride from its radiometabolites in plasma and evaluate [18F]fallypride at 150\u00a0min pi to be 22%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% of plasma radioactivity.The major in vivo radiometabolites of [18F]fallypride were produced by N-dealkylation and hydroxylation.

[3H]-flumazenil is an antagonist of benzodiazepine receptors and is generally used as a radioligand. In this study, the binding parameters of [3H]-flumazenil to rat cortical membranes were evaluated using two separation methods: filtration with GF/C filters and centrifugation. Additionally, the effects of vacuum pressure, exposure time to the cocktail, and geometry on the filtration method were studied. The binding parameters of [3H]-flumazenil (Kd and Bmax) were determined through saturation studies using two methods. The results from this study showed that the filtration method is time consuming and requires more steps to be completed. Because filtration causes partial elution of bound [3H]-flumazenil into the liquid scintillation cocktail, the results are not reproducible, which result in inaccurate estimation of the binding parameters. The centrifugation method in contrast to filtration is straightforward and produces reproducible as well as reliable results, all of the steps are performed in a single polypropylene tube, which eliminates the loss of tissue and avoids other systematic errors associated with transfer and handling.",

The brain was imaged for 60 (12\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min frames) or 90\u00a0min (18\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0min frames), and data was reconstructed using the 3D MAP algorithm. Specificity of [18F]AH114726 and [18F]GEH120348 was confirmed by displacement studies using unlabeled flumazenil.[18F]GEH120348 and [18F]AH114726 were obtained in 13\u201324% yields (end of synthesis) with high chemical (>\u00a095%) and radiochemical (>\u00a099%) purities, and high specific activities (2061\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0985\u00a0Ci/mmol). The in vivo pharmacokinetics of [18F]AH114726 and [18F]GEH120348 were determined in a non-human primate and directly compared with [11C]flumazenil. Both fluorine-18 radioligands showed time-dependent regional brain distributions that correlated with the distribution of [11C]flumazenil and the known concentrations of GABAA/benzodiazepine receptors in the monkey brain. [18F]AH114726 exhibited maximal brain uptake and tissue time-radioactivity curves that were most similar to [11C]flumazenil. In contrast, [18F]GEH120348 showed higher initial brain uptake but very different pharmacokinetics with continued accumulation of radioactivity into the cortical regions of high GABA/benzodiazepine receptor concentrations and very little clearance from the regions of low receptor densities. Rapid washout of both radiotracers occurred upon treatment with unlabeled flumazenil.The ease of the radiochemical synthesis, together with in vivo brain pharmacokinetics most similar to [11C]flumazenil, support that [18F]AH114726 is a suitable option for imaging the GABAA receptor.",

Micro-PET scan was performed after injection of approximately 35 MBq [11C]PBR28. In model A, volumes of interest (VOIs) were defined in the paw of Fisher 344 rats (n=6) with contralateral sham treatment as control. For model B, VOIs were defined in the tail, sacroiliac joints, hips, knees and thigh muscles of M. butyricum treated animals (n=8) and compared with sham-treated controls (n=4). The peak 11C-PBR28 SUV (SUVpeak) and area under the curve (AUCSUV) of 60-minute time-activity data were calculated. Immunohistochemistry for CD68, a macrophage stain, was performed from paw tissues. In addition, the [11C]PBR28 cell uptake was measured in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated and non-stimulated macrophage cultures.LPS-stimulated macrophages displayed dose-dependent increased [11C]PBR28 uptake, which was blocked by non-labeled PBR28. In both models, radiotracer uptake of treated lesions increased rapidly within minutes and displayed overall accumulative kinetics. The SUVpeak and AUCSUV of carrageenan-treated paws was significantly increased compared to controls. Also, the [11C]PBR28 uptake ratio of carrageenan-treated vs. sham-treated paw correlated significantly with CD68 staining ratios of the same animals. In adjuvant arthritis, significantly increased [11C]PBR28 SUVpeak and AUCSUV values were identified at the tail, knees, and sacroiliac joints, while no significant differences were identified in the lumbar spine and hips.Based on our initial data, [11C]PBR28 PET appears to have potential for imaging of various inflammatory processes involving macrophage activation.",

New information that these drugs alter epigenetic processes through their inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) has renewed interest in their biodistribution and pharmacokinetics and the relationship of these properties to their therapeutic and side effect profiles. In order to determine the pharmacokinetics and biodistribution of these drugs in primates, we synthesized their carbon-11 labeled analogues and performed dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) in six female baboons over 90\u00a0min. The carbon-11 labeled carboxylic acids were prepared by using 11CO2 and the appropriate Grignard reagents. [11C]BA was metabolized rapidly (only 20% of the total carbon-11 in plasma was parent compound at 5\u00a0min post injection) whereas for VPA and PBA 98% and 85% of the radioactivity were the unmetabolized compound at 30\u00a0min after their administration respectively. The brain uptake of all three carboxylic acids was very low (<\u00a00.006%ID/cc, BA\u00a0>\u00a0VPA\u00a0>\u00a0PBA), which is consistent with the need for very high doses for therapeutic efficacy. Most of the radioactivity was excreted through the kidneys and accumulated in the bladder. However, the organ biodistribution between the drugs differed. [11C]BA showed relatively high uptake in spleen and pancreas whereas [11C]PBA showed high uptake in liver and heart. Notably, [11C]VPA showed exceptionally high heart uptake possibly due to its involvement in lipid metabolism. The unique biodistribution of each of these drugs may be of relevance in understanding their therapeutic and side effect profile including their teratogenic effects.",

Therapeutic dose of 177Lu-DOTA-E[c(RGDfK)]2 (7.4\u00a0GBq) was prepared by adding the aqueous solution of the ligand and 177LuCl3 to 0.1\u00a0M NH4OAC buffer containing gentisic acid and incubating the reaction mixture at 90\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min. The yield and radiochemical purity of the complex was determined by HPLC technique. Parameters, such as, ligand-to-metal ratio, pH of the reaction mixture, incubation time and temperature were varied using tracer quantity of 177Lu (37\u00a0MBq) in order to arrive at the optimized protocol for the preparation of clinical dose. Biological behavior of the radiotracer prepared was studied in C57/BL6 mice bearing melanoma tumors.177Lu was produced with a specific activity of 950\u00a0\u00b1\u00a050\u00a0GBq/mg (25.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4\u00a0Ci/mg) and radionuclidic purity of 99.98%. A careful optimization of several parameters showed that 177Lu-DOTA-E[c(RGDfK)]2 could be prepared with adequately high radiochemical purity using a ligand-to-metal ratio ~\u00a02. Based on these studies therapeutic dose of the agent with 7.4\u00a0GBq of 177Lu was formulated in ~\u00a063\u00a0GBq/\u03bcM specific activity with high yield (98.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7%), radiochemical purity and in vitro stability. Biodistribution studies carried out in C57/BL6 mice bearing melanoma tumors revealed specific accumulation of the radiolabeled conjugate in tumor (3.80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55% ID/g at 30\u00a0min p.i.) with high tumor to blood and tumor to muscle ratios. However, the uptake of the radiotracer in the tumor was found to be reduced to 1.51\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 %ID/g at 72\u00a0h p.i.The present work successfully demonstrates the formulation of an optimized protocol for the preparation of 177Lu labeled DOTA-E[c(RGDfK)]2 for PRRT applications using 177Lu produced by direct neutron activation in a medium flux research reactor.",

     "abstract": "Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) has a significant role in regulating endocannabinoid signaling in the central nervous system. As such, FAAH inhibitors are being actively sought for pain, addiction, and other indications. This has led to the recent pursuit of positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers targeting FAAH. We report herein the preparation and preclinical evaluation of [11C-carbonyl]PF-04457845, an isotopologue of the potent irreversible FAAH inhibitor.PF-04457845 was radiolabeled at the carbonyl position via automated [11C]CO2-fixation. Ex vivo brain biodistribution of [11C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 was carried out in conscious rats. Specificity was determined by pre-administration of PF-04457845 or URB597 prior to [11C-carbonyl]PF-04457845. In a separate experiment, rats injected with the title radiotracer had whole brains excised, homogenized and extracted to examine irreversible binding to brain parenchyma.The title compound was prepared in 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01% (n\u00a0=\u00a04) isolated radiochemical yield based on starting [11C]CO2 (decay uncorrected) within 25\u00a0min from end-of-bombardment in >\u00a098% radiochemical purity and a specific activity of 73.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.2\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol at end-of-synthesis. Uptake of [11C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 into the rat brain was high (range of 1.2\u20134.4 SUV), heterogeneous, and in accordance with reported FAAH distribution. Saturable binding was demonstrated by a dose-dependent reduction in brain radioactivity uptake following pre-treatment with PF-04457845. Pre-treatment with the prototypical FAAH inhibitor, URB597, reduced the brain radiotracer uptake in all regions by 71\u201381%, demonstrating specificity for FAAH. The binding of [11C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 to FAAH at 40\u00a0min post injection was irreversible as 98% of the radioactivity in the brain could not be extracted.[11C-carbonyl]PF-04457845 was rapidly synthesized via an automated radiosynthesis. Ex vivo biodistribution studies in conscious rodents demonstrate that [11C PF-04457845 is a promising candidate radiotracer for imaging FAAH in the brain with PET. These results coupled with the known pharmacology and toxicology of PF-04457845 should facilitate clinical translation of this radiotracer.",

Compounds 3 and 4 were selected due to their promising in vitro preclinical profile; high affinity and selectivity for the \u03b11-adrenoceptor, favourable blood brain barrier permeability rates in Caco-2 monolayers and promising brain tissue/plasma ratio, assessed by equilibrium dialysis of free fraction in plasma and brain homogenate.Compounds [11C]3 and [11C]4 were synthesized from their desmethyl piperidine precursors with high specific radioactivity (>\u00a0370\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol) using [11C]methyl iodide. The 1,2,4-triazole analogue [11C]3 exhibited poor brain uptake, but the corresponding pyrimidyl analogue [11C]4 exhibited high brain exposure and binding in \u03b11-adrenoceptor rich brain regions. However, the binding could not be inhibited by pretreatment with prazosin (0.1\u00a0mg/kg and 0.3\u00a0mg/kg). The results were extended by autoradiography of [11C]4 binding in human brain sections and competition with antagonists from different structural families, revealing that only a minor portion of the observed binding of [11C]4 in brain was \u03b11-adrenoceptor specific.Though [11C]3 and [11C]4 proved not suitable as PET radioligands, the study provided further understanding of structural features influencing brain exposure of the chemical class of compounds related to the antipsychotic drug sertindole. It provided valuable insight in the delicacy of blood brain barrier penetration for structurally related compounds and underlines the importance for improved protocols for evaluation of brain penetration of future PET ligands.",

In this work we investigated the suitability of the radiolabeled Pgp inhibitors [11C]elacridar and [11C]tariquidar to visualize Pgp density in rat brain with PET.Rats underwent a first PET scan with [11C]elacridar (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or [11C]tariquidar (n\u00a0=\u00a06) followed by a second scan with the Pgp substrate (R)-[11C]verapamil after administration of unlabeled tariquidar at a dose which half-maximally inhibits cerebral Pgp (3\u00a0mg/kg). Compartmental modeling using an arterial input function and Logan graphical analysis were used to estimate rate constants and volumes of distribution (VT) of radiotracers in different brain regions.Brain PET signals of [11C]elacridar and [11C]tariquidar were very low (~\u00a00.5 standardized uptake value, SUV). There was a significant negative correlation between VT and K1 (i.e. influx rate constant from plasma into brain) values of [11C]elacridar or [11C]tariquidar and VT and K1 values of (R)-[11C]verapamil in different brain regions which was consistent with binding of [11C]inhibitors to Pgp and efflux of (R)-[11C]verapamil by Pgp.The small Pgp binding signals obtained with [11C]elacridar and [11C]tariquidar limit the applicability of these tracers to measure cerebral Pgp density.

For these reasons, several research groups have started to investigate the application of the fast growing field of microfluidic chemistry to radiosynthetic procedures. After the first report in 2004, many scientific papers have been published and demonstrated the potential for increased process yields, reduced reagent use, improved flexibility and general ease of setup. This review will address definitions occurring in microfluidics as well as analyze the different approaches under two macro-categories: microvessel and microchannel. In this perspective, several works will be collected, involving the use of positron emitting species (11C, 18F, 64Cu) and the fewer examples of gamma emitting radionuclides (99mTc, 125/131I).

     "abstract": "The \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin, which is expressed by angiogenic epithelium and some tumor cells, is an attractive target for the development of both imaging agents and therapeutics. While optimal implementation of \u03b1v\u03b23-targeted therapeutics will require a priori identification of the presence of the target, the clinical evaluation of these compounds has typically not included parallel studies with \u03b1v\u03b23-targeted diagnostics. This is at least partly due to the relatively limited availability of PET radiopharmaceuticals in comparison to those labeled with 99mTc. In an effort to begin to address this limitation, we evaluated the tumor uptake of 99mTc-NC100692, a cyclic RGD peptide that binds to \u03b1v\u03b23 with ~\u00a01-nM affinity, in an \u03b1v\u03b23-positive tumor model as well as its in vivo specificity.MicroSPECT imaging was used to assess the ability of cilengitide, a therapeutic with high affinity for \u03b1v\u03b23, to block and displace 99mTc-NC100692 in an orthotopic U87 glioma tumor. The specificity of 99mTc-NC100692 was quantitatively evaluated in mice bearing subcutaneous U87MG tumors, by comparison of the biodistribution of 99mTc-NC100692 with that of the non-specific structural analogue 99mTc-AH-111744 and by blocking uptake of 99mTc-NC100692 with excess unlabeled NC100692.MicroSPECT imaging studies demonstrated that uptake of 99mTc-NC100692 in the intracranial tumor model was both blocked and displaced by the \u03b1v\u03b23-targeted therapeutic cilengitide. Biodistribution studies provided quantitative confirmation of these imaging results. Tumor uptake of 99mTc-NC100692 at 1\u00a0h post-injection was 2.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7% ID/g compared to 0.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1% ID/g for 99mTc-AH-111744 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Blocking 99mTc-NC100692 uptake by pre-injecting the mice with excess unlabeled NC100692 reduced tumor uptake by approximately five-fold, to 0.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% ID/g (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).These results confirm that 99mTc-NC100692 does, in fact, target the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin and may, therefore, be useful in identifying patients prior to anti-\u03b1v\u03b23 therapy as well as monitoring the response of these patients to therapy.",

The aim of this study was to investigate possible 18F-FET uptake in the area of reactive gliosis in the vicinity of untreated and irradiated rat gliomas.F98-glioma cells were implanted into the caudate nucleus of 33 Fisher CDF rats. Sixteen animals remained untreated and in 17 animals the tumor was irradiated by Gamma Knife 5\u20138\u00a0days after implantation (2/50\u00a0Gy, 3/75\u00a0Gy, 6/100\u00a0Gy, 6/150\u00a0Gy). After 8\u201317 days of tumor growth the animals were sacrificed following injection of 18F-FET. Brains were removed, cut in coronal sections and autoradiograms of 18F-FET distribution were produced and compared with histology (toluidine blue) and reactive astrogliosis (GFAP staining). 18F-FET uptake in the tumors and in areas of reactive astrocytosis was evaluated by lesion to brain ratios (L/B).Large F98-gliomas were present in all animals showing increased 18F-FET-uptake which was similar in irradiated and non-irradiated tumors (L/B: 3.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 vs. 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3).

The area of 18F-FET-uptake in the tumor was congruent with histological tumor extent in 31/33 animals. In 2 rats irradiated with 150\u00a0Gy, however, high 18F-FET uptake was noted in the area of astrogliosis which led to an overestimation of the tumor size.Reactive astrogliosis in the vicinity of gliomas generally leads to only a slight 18F-FET-enrichment that appears not to affect the correct definition of tumor extent for treatment planning.",

Biodistribution studies demonstrate high uptake of [18F]-L-FPTP in liver, kidney, pancreas, and blood at the early phase, and fast clearance in most tissues over the whole observed time. The uptake studies in Hepa1-6 cells suggest that [18F]-L-FPTP is transported by the amino acid transport system B0,+, LAT2 and ASC. [18F]-L-FPTP displays good stability and is not incorporated into proteins in vitro. PET imaging shows that [18F]-L-FPTP can be a better potential PET tracer for differentiating tumor from inflammation than [18F]FDG and 5-(3-[18F]fluoroethyloxy)-L-tryptophan ([18F]-L-FEHTP), with high [18F]-L-FPTP uptake ratio (2.53) of tumor to inflammation at 60\u00a0min postinjection.Using [18F]fluoropropyl derivatives as intermediates, the new tracer [18F]-L-FPTP was achieved with good yield and radiochemical purity, and the biological evaluation results of [18F]-L-FPTP showed that it was a hopeful tracer for PET tumor imaging.",

The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay demonstrated a significantly greater surviving fraction in the TMZ-resistant subline (C6R) than in drug-naive cells (C6).

C6 and C6R cells were inoculated into the right and left basal ganglia, respectively, of rats. Efficacy of TMZ against the orthotopic gliomas was analyzed by MRI, Evans blue extravasation, anti-14C-FACBC and 3H-Met autoradiography, and MIB-5 proliferation index.The 3H-TdR accumulation rate and amino acid tracer (anti-14C-FACBC and 3H-Met) uptake significantly decreased 48 and 72\u00a0h, respectively, after TMZ treatment in C6 but not C6R cells. Anti-14C-FACBC uptake correlated significantly with 3H-Met uptake and the 3H-TdR accumulation rate. In the intracerebral glioma model, anti-14C-FACBC and 3H-Met autoradiography clearly delineated the tumor extent, which spread well beyond the high-T2-intensity and enhancing lesions visible on MRI and Evans blue extravasation. TMZ significantly decreased anti-14C-FACBC and 3H-Met uptake and the MIB-5 index of C6 but not C6R tumors. TMZ inhibited tracer uptake and tumor proliferation before morphological changes on MRI.Anti-14C-FACBC, like 3H-Met, was more sensitive than post-contrast T1-weighted MRI for detecting tumor extent and early tumor response to TMZ treatment.

     "abstract": "Necrosis is a form of cell death that occurs in a variety of pathological conditions but can also be the result of therapy in cancer treatment. A radiotracer that could image necrotic cell death using PET could therefore be a useful tool to provide relevant information on the disease activity or therapeutic efficacy and assist in diagnosis and therapy management of several disorders. Pamoic acid derivatives have previously been reported to show a selective uptake in tissue undergoing cellular death via necrosis. In this study 4,4\u2032-methylene-bis(2-hydroxy-3-naphthoic hydrazide) (pamoic acid bis-hydrazide) was conjugated to the macrocyclic ligand DOTA and labeled with the generator produced positron emitter 68Ga. The resulting complex (68Ga-bis-DOTA-PA; 68Ga-3) was evaluated as a potential radiotracer for imaging tissues undergoing cellular death via necrosis.Bis-DOTA-PA was synthesized and labeled with 68Ga. Biodistribution of 68Ga-3 and analysis of plasma were studied in normal NMRI mice. Binding of the complex to necrotic tissue was first evaluated by in vitro autoradiography. Further evaluation of the uptake in necrotic tissue was performed in two different models of necrosis using microPET imaging in correlation with ex vivo autoradiography, biodistribution studies and histochemical staining. A biodistribution study in a mouse model of hepatic apoptosis was performed to study the selectivity of the uptake of 68Ga-bis-DOTA-PA in necrotic tissue.68Ga-3 was obtained with a decay-corrected radiochemical yield of 51.8%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4% and a specific activity of about 12\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol. In normal mice, the complex was slowly cleared from blood, mainly through the renal pathway, and showed high in vivo stability. 68Ga-bis-DOTA-PA displayed high and selective uptake in necrotic tissue and allowed imaging of necrotic tissue using microPET.68Ga-3 was synthesized and characterized. In vitro, in vivo and ex vivo studies showed that the complex displays high and selective uptake in tissue undergoing cellular death via necrosis.",

     "abstract": "Bone metastases are a class of cancerous metastases that result from the invasion of a tumor into bone. The solid mass which forms inside the bone is often associated with a constant dull ache and severe spikes in pain, which greatly reduce the quality of life of the patient. Numerous 99mTc-labeled bisphosphonate functionalised complexes are well established tracers for bone metastases imaging. The objective of this research was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and behaviour of three DOTA based bisphosphonate functionalised ligands (BPAMD, BPAPD and BPPED), using both 68Ga \u03bc-PET in vivo imaging and ex vivo biodistribution studies in healthy Wistar rats. The compounds were labelled with 68Ga in high yields using an ammonium acetate buffer, and subsequently purified using a cation exchange resin. High bone uptake values were observed for all 68Ga-labelled bisphosphonates at 60\u00a0minutes p.i. The highest uptake was observed for [68Ga]BPPED (2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3% ID/g) which compares favourably with that of [99mTc]MDP (2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1 ID/g) and [18F]fluoride (2.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2% ID/g). The 68Ga-labelled DOTA-bisphosphonates showed rapid clearance from the blood and renal system, as well as low binding to soft tissue, resulting in a high bone to blood ratio (9.9 at 60\u00a0minutes p.i. for [68Ga]BPPED, for example). Although further studies are required to assess their performance in tumor models, the results obtained suggest that these ligands could be useful both in imaging (68Ga) and therapeutic treatment (177Lu) of bone metastases.",

     "abstract": "The prognosis of malignant gliomas remains largely unsatisfactory for the intrinsic characteristics of the pathology and for the delayed diagnosis. Multimodal imaging based on PET and MRI may assess the dynamics of disease onset and progression allowing the validation of preclinical models of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The aim of this study was the characterization of a syngeneic rat model of GBM using combined in vivo imaging and immunohistochemistry.Four groups of Fischer rats were implanted in a subcortical region with increasing concentration of rat glioma F98 cells and weekly monitored with Gd-MR, [18F]FDG- and [18F]FAZA-PET starting one week after surgery. Different targets were evaluated on post mortem brain specimens using immunohistochemistry: VEGF, GFAP, HIF-1\u03b1, Ki-67 and nestin.Imaging results indicated that tumor onset but not progression was related to the number of F98 cells. Hypoxic regions identified with [18F]FAZA and high-glucose metabolism regions recognized with [18F]FDG were located respectively in the core and in external areas of the tumor, with partial overlap and remodeling during disease progression. Histological and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed PET/MRI results and revealed that our model resumes biological characteristics of human GBM. IHC and PET studies showed that necrotic regions, defined on the basis of [18F]FDG uptake reduction, may include hypoxic clusters of vital tumor tissue identified with [18F]FAZA. This last information is particularly relevant for the identification of the target volume during image-guided radiotherapy.In conclusion, the combined use of PET and MRI allows in vivo monitoring of the biological modification of F98 lesions during tumor progression.",

     "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a rapidly expanding, cutting edge technology for preclinical evaluation, cancer diagnosis and staging, and patient management. A one-step aqueous 18F-labeling method, which can be applied to peptides to provide functional in vivo images, has been a long-standing challenge in PET imaging. Over the past few years, we have sought a rapid and mild radiolabeling method based on the aqueous radiosynthesis of in vivo stable aryltrifluoroborate (ArBF3\u2212) conjugates. Recent access to production levels of 18F-Fluoride led to a fluorescent-18F-ArBF3\u2212 at unprecedentedly high specific activities of 15\u00a0Ci/\u03bcmol. However, extending this method to labeling peptides as imaging agents has not been explored.In order to extend these results to a peptide of clinical interest in the context of production-level radiosynthesis, we applied this new technology for labeling RGD, measured its specific activity by standard curve analysis, and carried out a preliminary evaluation of its imaging properties.RGD was labeled in excellent radiochemical yields at exceptionally high specific activity (~\u00a014\u00a0Ci/\u03bcmol) (n\u00a0=\u00a03). Preliminary tumor-specific images corroborated by ex vivo biodistribution data with blocking controls show statistically significant albeit relatively low tumor uptake along with reasonably high tumor:blood ratios (n\u00a0=\u00a03).Isotope exchange on a clinically useful 18F-ArBF3\u2212 radiotracer leads to excellent radiochemical yields and exceptionally high specific activities while the anionic nature of the aryltrifluoroborate prosthetic results in very rapid clearance. Since rapid clearance of the radioactive tracer is generally desirable for tracer development, these results suggest new directions for varying linker arm composition to slightly retard clearance rather than enhancing it.This work is the first to use production levels of 18F-activity to directly label RGD at specific activities that are an order of magnitude higher than most reports and thereby increases the distribution window for radiotracer production and delivery.",

     "abstract": "2-[18F]Fluoroethoxy and 3-[18F]fluoropropoxy groups are common moieties in the structures of radiotracers used with positron emission tomography. The objectives of this study were (1) to develop an efficient one-step method for the preparation of 2-[18F]fluoroethanol (2-[18F]FEtOH) and 3-[18F]fluoropropanol (3-[18F]FPrOH); (2) to demonstrate the feasibility of using 2-[18F]FEtOH as a nucleophile for the synthesis of 2-[18F]fluoroethyl aryl esters and ethers; and (3) to determine the biodistribution profiles of 2-[18F]FEtOH and 3-[18F]FPrOH in mice.2-[18F]FEtOH and 3-[18F]FPrOH were prepared by reacting n-Bu4N[18F]F with ethylene carbonate and 1,3-dioxan-2-one, respectively, in diethylene glycol at 165\u00a0\u00b0C and purified by distillation. 2-[18F]fluoroethyl 4-fluorobenzoate and 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)-4-nitrobenzene were prepared by coupling 2-[18F]FEtOH with 4-fluorobenzoyl chloride and 1-fluoro-4-nitrobenzene, respectively. Biodistribution and PET/CT imaging studies of 2-[18F]FEtOH and 3-[18F]FPrOH were performed in normal female Balb/C mice.The preparation of 2-[18F]FEtOH and 3-[18F]FPrOH took 60\u00a0min, and their decay-corrected yields were 88.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0% (n\u00a0=\u00a09) and 65.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.2% (n\u00a0=\u00a05), respectively. The decay-corrected yields for the preparation of 2-[18F]fluoroethyl 4-fluorobenzoate and 1-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)-4-nitrobenzene were 36.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a03) and 27.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a03), respectively. Imaging/biodistribution studies in mice using 2-[18F]FEtOH showed high initial radioactivity accumulation in all major organs followed by very slow clearance. On the contrary, by using 3-[18F]FPrOH, radioactivity accumulated in all major organs was cleared rapidly, but massive in vivo defluorination (31.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.57%ID/g in bone at 1\u00a0h post-injection) was observed.Using 2-[18F]FEtOH/3-[18F]FPrOH as a nucleophile is a competitive new strategy for the synthesis of 2-[18F]fluoroethyl/3-[18F]fluoropropyl aryl esters and ethers. Our biodistribution data emphasize the importance of in vivo stability of PET tracers containing a 2-[18F]fluoroethyl or 3-[18F]fluoropropyl group due to high background and high bone uptake resulting from 2-[18F]FEtOH and 3-[18F]FPrOH, respectively. This is especially important for their aryl ester derivatives which are prone to in vivo hydrolysis.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) as a nuclear medicine technique, has recently demonstrated the advantages in determining the severity of disease and in evaluating the efficacy of treatments in a variety of neoplasm, including breast cancer. Because this procedure is able to pinpoint molecular activity within the body, it offers the potential to identify disease in its earliest stages as well as a patient\u2019s immediate response to therapeutic interventions in a non-invasive way. In this paper we performed an extended view about the correlation between molecular factors of breast cancer and PET tracers; in particular, we focalized our attention on their possible advantages in terms of 1) early detection of primary or recurrent cancer; 2) as a guide for target therapies and 3) for the evaluation of response to specific and now-available molecular treatments.",

Currently, the first RIT clinical trial employing 212Pb radiolabeled trastuzumab is in progress. This report provides detailed current protocol operations and steps that were generated for use in the clinical trial as well as the relevant pre-clinical experimentation, and describes in detail the labeling of proteins or peptides with 212Pb as provided via a 224Ra based generator system.212Pb was eluted from the 224Ra/212Pb generator using hydrochloric acid (2\u00a0M). The generator eluate was evaporated and digested with nitric acid (8\u00a0M) followed by extraction of the 212Pb with dilute nitric acid (0.1\u00a0M). The dilute nitric acid solution of 212Pb was used to label the immunoconjugate Trastuzumab-TCMC (2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl-1,4,7,10-tetraaza-1,4,7,10,tetra-(2-carbamonylmethyl)-cyclododecane) at pH\u00a05.5.Elution of 212Pb from the generator was efficient yielding\u00a0>\u00a090% of available 212Pb.

     "abstract": "A major barrier to the advancement of therapeutic nanomedicines has been the non-target toxicity caused by the accumulation of the drug delivery systems in organs associated with the reticuloendothelial system, particularly the liver and spleen. Herein, we report the development of peptide based metabolically active linkers (MALs) that are enzymatically cleaved by cysteine cathepsin B and S, two proteases highly expressed in the liver and spleen. The overall goal of this approach is to utilize the MALs to lower the non-target retention and toxicity of radiolabeled drug delivery systems, thus resulting in higher diagnostic and radiotherapeutic efficacy.In this study three MALs (MAL0, MAL1 and MAL2) were investigated. MAL1 and MAL2 are composed of known substrates of cathepsin B and S, respectively, while MAL0 is a non-cleavable control. Both MAL1 and MAL2 were shown to undergo enzymatic cleavage with the appropriate cathepsin protease. Subsequent to conjugation to the HPMA copolymer and radiolabeling with 177Lu, the peptide\u2013polymer conjugates were renamed 177Lu-metabolically active copolymers (177Lu-MACs) with the corresponding designations: 177Lu-MAC0, 177Lu-MAC1 and 177Lu-MAC2.In vivo evaluation of the 177Lu-MACs was performed in an HPAC human pancreatic cancer xenograft mouse model. 177Lu-MAC1 and 177Lu-MAC2 demonstrated 3.1 and 2.1 fold lower liver retention, respectively, compared to control (177Lu-MAC0) at 72\u00a0h post-injection. With regard to spleen retention, 177Lu-MAC1 and 177Lu-MAC2 each exhibited a nearly fourfold lower retention, relative to control, at the 72\u00a0h time point. However, the tumor accumulation of the 177Lu-MAC0 was two to three times greater than 177Lu-MAC1 and 177Lu-MAC2 at the same time point. The MAL approach demonstrated the capability of substantially reducing the non-target retention of the 177Lu-labeled HPMA copolymers.While further studies are needed to optimize the pharmacokinetics of the 177Lu-MACs design, the ability of the MAL to significantly decrease non-target retention establishes the potential this avenue of research may have for the improvement of diagnostic and radiotherapeutic drug delivery systems.",

In this study, the potential of 18F-AlF-NOTA-AE105 to specifically target uPAR-positive prostate tumors was investigated.NOTA-conjugated AE105 was synthesized and radiolabeled with 18F-AlF according to a recently published optimized protocol. The labeled product was purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography RP-HPLC. The tumor targeting properties were evaluated in mice with subcutaneously inoculated PC-3 xenografts using small animal PET and ex vivo biodistribution studies. uPAR-binding specificity was studied by coinjection of an excess of a uPAR antagonist peptide AE105 analogue (AE152).NOTA-AE105 was labeled with 18F-AlF in high radiochemical purity (>\u00a092%) and yield (92.7%) and resulted in a specific activity of greater than 20\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol.

Good tumor-to-background ratio was observed with small animal PET and confirmed in the biodistribution analysis. Ex vivo uPAR expression analysis on extracted tumors confirmed human uPAR expression that correlated close with tumor uptake of 18F-AlF-NOTA-AE105.The first 18F-labeled uPAR PET ligand, 18F-AlF-NOTA-AE105, has successfully been prepared and effectively visualized noninvasively uPAR positive prostate cancer.

Similarly, L-[methyl-11C]-methionine (11C-MET), the most popular amino acid PET tracer, is a possible candidate for this purpose. We investigated the transport mechanism of 18\u00a0F-FBPA and compared it with that of 14C-MET in human glioblastoma cell lines.Uptake of 18\u00a0F-FBPA and 14C-MET was examined in A172, T98G, and U-87MG cells using 2-aminobicyclo-(2.2.1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (a system L-specific substrate), 2-(methylamino)-isobutyric acid (a system A-specific substrate), and BPA. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction.System L was mainly involved in the uptake of 18\u00a0F-FBPA (74.5%\u201381.1% of total uptake) and 14C-MET (48.3%\u201359.4%). System A and ASC also contributed to the uptake of 14C-MET. Inhibition experiments revealed that BPA significantly decreased the uptake of 18\u00a0F-FBPA, whereas 31%\u201342% of total 14C-MET uptake was transported by BPA non-sensitive transporters. In addition, 18\u00a0F-FBPA uptake correlated with LAT1 and total LAT expressions.This study demonstrated that 18\u00a0F-FBPA was predominantly transported by system L in human glioblastoma cells compared to 14C-MET. Although further studies are needed to elucidate the correlation between 18\u00a0F-FBPA uptake and BPA content in tumor tissues, 18\u00a0F-FBPA is suitable for the selection of patients who benefit from BNCT with BPA.",

Accurate delineation of tumor margins is important for preventing local recurrence.Six patients with HER2-positive in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma were administered 74\u00a0MBq (0.5\u00a0mg) of 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments and counts in the tumor, surgical cavity wall and en face margins were measured intraoperatively at 72\u00a0h post-injection using the Navigator or C-Trak \u03b3-probes. Margins were evaluated histologically. Quantitative whole body planar imaging was performed to estimate radiation absorbed doses using OLINDA/EXM software. SPECT imaging of the thorax was performed to evaluate tumor uptake. The pharmacokinetics of elimination from the blood and plasma were determined over 72\u00a0h.There were no acute adverse reactions from 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments and no changes in hematological or biochemical indices were found over a 3\u00a0month period. 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments exhibited a biphasic elimination from the blood and plasma with t1/2\u03b1\u00a0=\u00a011.9\u00a0h and 7.5\u00a0h, respectively, and t1/2\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a026.6 and 20.7\u00a0h, respectively. The radiopharmaceutical accumulated in the liver, spleen and kidneys. SPECT imaging did not reveal tumor in any patient. The mean effective dose was 0.146\u00a0mSv/MBq (10.8\u00a0mSv for 74\u00a0MBq). Counts in excised tumors were low but were higher than in margins. Margins in two patients harboured tumor but this was not correlated with counts obtained using the \u03b3-probes. Surgical cavity counts were high and likely due to detection of \u03b3-photons outside the surgical field.We conclude that it was not feasible, at least at the administered amount of radioactivity used in this study, to reliably detect the margins of disease in patients with in situ or invasive ductal carcinoma intraoperatively using a hand-held \u03b3-probe and 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab fragments due to low uptake in the tumor and involved margins.",

Recently, radiolabeled FIAU was found to be a substrate for the thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme of multiple pathogenic bacteria, leading to its translational use in the imaging of bacterial infections. Patients with immunodeficiencies, however, are susceptible to a different group of pathogenic bacteria when compared to immunocompetent subjects. In this study, we wanted to predict the usefulness of radiolabeled FIAU in the detection of bacterial infections commonly occurring in patients with immunodeficiencies, in vitro, prior to attempting in vivo imaging with 124I-FIAU-PET.We obtained representative strains of bacterial pathogens isolated from actual patients with genetic immunodeficiencies. We evaluated the bacterial susceptibility of different strains to the effect of incubation with FIAU, which would implicate the presence of the thymidine kinase (TK) enzyme. We also incubated the bacteria with 14C-FIAU and consequently measured its rate of incorporation in the bacterial DNA using a liquid scintillation counter.Unlike the other bacterial strains, the growth of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not halted by FIAU at any concentration. All the tested clinical isolates demonstrated different levels of 14C-FIAU uptake, except for P. aeruginosa.Radiolabeled FIAU has been successful in delineating bacterial infections, both in preclinical and pilot translational studies. In patients with immunodeficiencies, Pseudomonas infections are commonly encountered and are usually difficult to differentiate from fungal infections. The use of radiolabeled FIAU for in vivo imaging of those patients, however, would not be useful, considering the apparent lack of TK enzyme in Pseudomonas. One has to keep in mind that not all pathogenic bacteria possess the TK enzyme and as such will not all retain FIAU. Our technique is simple, and can be easily used to assess whether a certain bacterial strain of interest can or cannot be visualized using radiolabeled FIAU.",

Despite much research into the complex pharmacokinetic profile and pharmacodynamic effects of irinotecan, unpredictable and severe side effects are still commonly observed. In this study, we synthesized [11C]irinotecan as a positron emission tomography (PET) probe, performed the metabolite analysis, and evaluated the biodistribution and kinetics of [11C]irinotecan using small animal PET.[11C]Irinotecan was synthesized by two routes using [11C]phosgene and [11C]carbon dioxide fixation.

In the PET study in mice, the radioactivity levels in the brain, liver, and small intestine were slightly increased by inhibition of the Pgp/Bcrp function for more than 30\u00a0min after [11C]irinotecan injection. This result demonstrated that in vivo behavior of [11C] irinotecan and radioactive metabolites are influenced by the Pgp/Bcrp function.PET studies using [11C]irinotecan combined with metabolite analysis may be a useful tool for evaluating irinotecan pharmacokinetics and toxicity.",

The plasma samples taken from monkey or human during PET measurements were mixed with a micellar eluent containing an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate and loaded onto SPE cartridges. The amount of radioactivity corresponding to parent radioligand (retained on the cartridge) and its radioactive metabolites (eluted with micellar eluent) was measured.Under the optimized conditions, excellent separation of target PET radioligands from their radiometabolites was achieved with a single elution and short run-time of 1\u00a0min. This method was successfully applied to study the metabolism for 11C-labelled radioligands in human or monkey plasma. The amount of parent PET radioligands estimated by micellar solid phase extraction strongly corresponded with that determined by radio-LC. The improved throughput permitted the analysis of a large number of plasma samples (up to 13 samples per one PET study) for accurate estimation of metabolite-corrected input function during quantitative PET imaging studies.Solid phase extraction together with micellar medium is fast, sensitive and easy to use, and therefore it is an attractive alternative method to determine relative composition of PET radioligands in plasma.",

The tracers that can be eliminated are termed \u2018incomplete trapping irreversible tracers\u2019. These incomplete trapping irreversible tracers may be clinically useful when the tracer \u03b2-value, the ratio of the tracer (metabolite) elimination rate to the tracer efflux rate, is under approximately 0.1. In this study, we propose a non-input analysis for incomplete trapping irreversible tracers based on the shape analysis (Shape), a non-input analysis used for irreversible tracers.A Monte Carlo simulation study based on experimental monkey data with two actual PET tracers (a complete trapping irreversible tracer [11C]MP4A and an incomplete trapping irreversible tracer [18\u00a0F]FEP-4MA) was performed to examine the effects of the environmental error and the tracer elimination rate on the estimation of the k3-parameter (corresponds to metabolic rate) using Shape (original) and modified Shape (M-Shape) analysis. The simulation results were also compared with the experimental results obtained with the two PET tracers.When the tracer \u03b2-value was over 0.03, the M-Shape method was superior to the Shape method for the estimation of the k3-parameter. The simulation results were also in reasonable agreement with the experimental ones.M-Shape can be used as the non-input analysis of incomplete trapping irreversible tracers for PET study.",

We studied this affinity to assess the mechanism of anti-FACBC transport in prostate cancer cells.Kinetic assays for trans-1-amino-3-fluoro-[1-14C]cyclobutanecarboxylic acid ([14C]FACBC) were performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes over-expressing either ASCT2 or sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporter 2 (SNAT2), both of which are highly expressed in prostate cancer cells.

Desipramine pretreatment reduced myocardial HED retention index by 69% and SUV by 85%. Chase treatment with desipramine increased monoexponential HED washout by 197% compared to untreated controls. Norepinephrine infusion dose-dependently reduced HED accumulation, reflected by both retention index and SUV, with a corresponding increase in monoexponential washout. Plasma and cardiac norepinephrine levels correlated with HED quantitative measurements.The repeatability of HED retention index, SUV, and monoexponential washout supports its suitability for longitudinal PET studies in rats.

In this study, to develop a radiobromine-labeled vesamicol analog as a sigma receptor imaging agent for PET, nonradioactive and radiobromine-labeled (+)-2-[4-(4-bromophenyl)piperidino]cyclohexanol ((+)-pBrV) was prepared and evaluated in vitro and in vivo. In these initial studies, 77Br was used because of its longer half-life.(+)-[77Br]pBrV was prepared by a bromodestannylation reaction with radiochemical purity of 98.8% after HPLC purification. The partition coefficient of (+)-[77Br]pBrV was measured. In vitro binding characteristics of (+)-pBrV to sigma receptors were assayed. Biodistribution experiments were performed by intravenous administration of a mixed solution of (+)-[77Br]pBrV and (+)-[125I]pIV into DU-145 tumor-bearing mice.The lipophilicity of (+)-[77Br]pBrV was lower than that of (+)-[125I]pIV. As a result of in vitro binding assay to sigma receptors, the affinities of (+)-pBrV to sigma receptors were competitive to those of (+)-pIV. In biodistribution experiments, (+)-[77Br]pBrV and (+)-[125I]pIV showed high uptake in tumor via sigma receptors. The biodistributions of both radiotracers showed similar patterns. However, the accumulation of radioactivity in liver after injection of (+)-[77Br]pBrV was significantly lower compared to that of (+)-[125I]pIV.These results indicate that radiobromine-labeled pBrV possesses great potential as a sigma receptor imaging agent for PET.",

Comparative biodistribution/dosimetry of both radiotracers was performed in non-tumor bearing athymic nude mice (n=2 females and n=2 males) over 1-week following i.v. injection of either using 89Zr-DFO-panitumumab or 111In-CHX-A\u201d-DTPA-panitumumab. Micro-PET/CT imaging of female athymic nude mice bearing human breast cancer tumors (n=5 per tumor group) with variable HER1-expression very low (BT-474), moderate (MDA-MB-231), and very high (MDA-MB-468) was performed at over 1 week following i.v. injection of 89Zr-DFO-panitumumab.Radiochemical yield and purity of 89Zr-Panitumumab was >\u00a070% and >\u00a098% respectively with specific activity 150 \u00b1 10 MBq/mg of panitumumab in a ~\u00a04 hr synthesis time.

For each targeting model we established the relationship between survival and mean nucleus absorbed dose using the MIRD formalism.In both p53\u2212/\u2212 and p53+/+ HCT116 cells, anti-CEA 125I-mAbs were more cytotoxic per Gy than anti-HER1 125I-mAbs. Sensitivity to anti-CEA 125I-mAbs was p53-independent, while sensitivity to anti-HER1 125I-mAbs was higher in p53\u2212/\u2212 HCT 116 cells, suggesting that they act through different signaling pathways. Apoptosis was only induced in p53+/+ HCT116 cells and could not explain cell membrane radiation sensitivity. Inhibition of autophagy did not modify the cell response to 125I-mAbs. By contrast, mitotic death was similarly induced in both p53\u2212/\u2212 and p53+/+ HCT116 cells by the two types of 125I-mAbs. We also showed using medium transfer experiments that \u03b3-H2AX foci were produced in bystander cells.Cell membrane sensitivity to 125I-mAbs is not mediated by apoptosis and is p53-independent. Bystander effects-mediated mitotic death could be involved in the efficacy of 125I-mAbs binding cell surface receptors.",

Methods: The c(RGDyK) peptide was conjugated to a maleimidopropionyl (MP) moiety through Lys, and the MP group was used as the branch position to form a thioether with the Cys12 side chain of the Tat(49\u201357)-spacer-N2S2 peptide. 99mTc-Tat-RGD was prepared, and stability studies were carried out by size exclusion HPLC analyses in human serum. The in vitro affinity for \u03b1(v)\u03b2(3) integrin was determined by a competitive binding assay. In vitro internalization was determined using glioblastoma C6 cells. Biodistribution studies were accomplished in athymic mice with C6 induced tumors that had blocked and unblocked receptors. Images were obtained using a micro-SPECT/CT. Results: 99mTc-Tat-RGD was obtained with a radiochemical purity higher than 95%, as determined by radio-HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. Protein binding was 15.7% for 99mTc-Tat-RGD and 5.6% for 99mTc-RGD.

Methods: The skeletal involvement from prostate cancer metastases was assessed by both 99mTc-diphosphonate bone scan (BS) and 18F-fluoride PET/CT within four weeks in 24 patients (67.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.1\u00a0years) suffering from a borderline degree of bone pain for which radionuclide palliation was not shortly planned for administration. The BS and 18F-fluoride PET/CT results were compared, assessing the number and extension of the skeletal sites involved. Afterward, the patients were randomly assigned either to the study group (N\u00a0=\u00a012) receiving radionuclide therapy (Samarium-153 EDTMP) or to the control group (N\u00a0=\u00a012) not receiving radionuclide therapy.

Results: Overall, at BS, 7.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 sites were considered metastatic, involving at least 5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01 body regions. At 18F-fluoride PET/CT, 116\u00a0\u00b1\u00a019 sites presented metastatic involvement with 12/12 body regions concerned. No differences were found in regards to either the number of metastatic sites or regions at both BS and 18F-fluoride PET/CT between the study group and controls (p\u00a0=\u00a0ns). At CT, 88 blastic metastases were identified, whereas 110 were mainly lytic. Most of mainly lytic lesions were not detectable at BS. The reduction in total discomfort and bone pain in the study group was significantly greater than in the controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Conclusion: Sm-153 EDTMP therapy should be considered for patients with early bone pain from prostate cancer even if their BS only indicates a few metastases before the initiation of a severe pain syndrome. 18F-fluoride PET/CT may be helpful in deciding if the implementation of bone pain palliation using bone-seeking radionuclides at pain onset is necessary.",

We examined the effect of reduced FFAs on glucose metabolism in androgen-dependent (CWR22Rv1) and androgen-independent (PC3) prostate cancer (PCa) xenografts.Subcutaneous tumors were produced in nude mice by injection of PC3 and CWR22Rv1 PCa cells. The mice were divided into two groups (Acipimox vs. controls). Acipimox (50\u00a0mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage 1\u00a0h before injection of tracers. 1\u00a0h after i.v. co-injection of 8.2\u00a0MBq (222\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.0\u00a0\u03bcCi) 18\u00a0F-FDG and\u00a0~\u00a00.0037\u00a0MBq (0.1\u00a0\u03bcCi) 14C-acetate, 18\u00a0F-FDG imaging was performed using a small-animal PET scanner. Counting rates in reconstructed images were converted to activity concentrations. Quantification was obtained by region-of-interest analysis using dedicated software. The mice were euthanized, and blood samples and organs were harvested. 18\u00a0F radioactivity was measured in a calibrated \u03b3-counter using a dynamic counting window and decay correction. 14C radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting using external standard quench corrections. Counts were converted into activity, and percentage of the injected dose per gram (%ID/g) tissue was calculated.FDG biodistribution data in mice with PC3 xenografts demonstrated doubled average %ID/g tumor tissue after administration of Acipimox compared to controls (7.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.93 vs. 3.59\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.35, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Tumor-to-organ ratios were generally higher in mice treated with Acipimox. This was supported by PET imaging data, both semi-quantitatively (mean tumor FDG uptake) and visually (tumor-to-background ratios). In mice with CWR22Rv1 xenografts there was no effect of Acipimox on FDG uptake, either in biodistribution or PET imaging. 14C-acetate uptake was unaffected in PC3 and CWR22Rv1 xenografts.In mice with PC3 PCa xenografts, acute administration of Acipimox increases tumor uptake of 18\u00a0F-FDG with general improvements in tumor-to-background ratios. Data indicate that administration of Acipimox prior to 18\u00a0F-FDG PET scans has potential to improve sensitivity and specificity in patients with castration-resistant advanced PCa.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate kinetic models of [18F]FDG metabolism under a wide range of dietary interventions taking into account variations in arterial (HA) and portal vein (PV) input.The study consisted of three groups of rats maintained under different diet interventions: 12\u00a0h fasted, 24\u00a0h fasted and those fed with high fructose diet. [15O]H2O PET imaging was used to characterize liver flow contribution from HA and PV to the liver's dual input function (DIF). [18F]FDG PET imaging was used to characterize liver metabolism. Differences in [18F]FDG kinetics in HA, PV and liver under different diet interventions were investigated. An arterial to PV Transfer Function (TF) was optimized in all three dietary states to noninvasively estimate PV activity. Finally, two compartment 3-parameter (2C3P), two compartment 4-parameter (2C4P), two compartment 5-parameter (2C5P), and three compartment 5-parameter (3C5P) models were evaluated and compared to describe the kinetics of [18F]FDG in the liver across diet interventions. Sensitivity of the compartmental models to ratios of HA to PV flow fractions was further investigated.Differences were found in HA and PV [18F]FDG kinetics across 12\u00a0h fasted, 24\u00a0h fasted and high fructose fed diet interventions. A two exponential TF model was able to estimate portal activity in all the three diet interventions. Statistical analysis suggests that a 2C3P model configuration was adequate to describe the kinetics of [18F]FDG in the liver under wide ranging dietary interventions. The net influx of [18F]FDG was lowest in the 12\u00a0h fasted group, followed by 24\u00a0h fasted group, and high fructose diet.A TF was optimized to non-invasively estimate PV time activity curve in different dietary states. Several kinetic models were assessed and a 2C3P model was sufficient to describe [18F]FDG liver kinetics despite differences in HA and PV kinetics across wide ranging dietary interventions.

Altogether seven PET measurements were performed in three cynomolgus monkeys including baseline and co-injection experiments with unlabelled AZD9272 (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg). Radiometabolites in plasma were measured using HPLC.[11C]AZD9272 was prepared in over 50% incorporation yield from hydrogen [11C]cyanide in a total synthesis time of 45\u201350\u00a0min. The radiochemical purity of the radioligand in its final formulation was high (>\u00a099%) and the mean specific radioactivity was 47 GBq/ \u03bcmol (1278 Ci/mmol, n\u00a0=\u00a07) calculated at end of bombardment (EOB). In the baseline measurements 10% of the total injected radioactivity was present in monkey brain at five minutes after i.v. injection. The radioactivity concentration was high in the caudate, cingulate gyrus and thalamus whereas it was moderate in the temporal cortex and lower for the cerebellum. After co-injection with cold AZD9272 the binding of [11C]AZD9272 was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion. Analysis of radiometabolites showed relatively slow metabolism and resulted only in hydrophilic radiometabolites.A fast and efficient method was developed to label AZD9272 with 11C. PET-examination in Cynomolgus monkeys showed that [11C]AZD9272 entered the brain to a high extent, that binding was saturable and that the regional radioactivity pattern was in accordance with the known distribution of mGluR5.

Although several acetylcholinesterase (AChE) PET tracers radiolabeled with carbon-11 exist, no fluorinated radiotracer is currently used in clinical imaging studies. The purpose of the present study is to describe the first fluorinated PET radiotracer for this brain enzyme.Three structural analogs of huprine, a specific AChE inhibitor presenting high affinity towards AChE in vitro, were synthesized and labeled with fluorine-18 via a mesylate/fluoro-nucleophilic aliphatic substitution: ([18\u00a0F]-FHUa, [18\u00a0F]-FHUb and [18\u00a0F]-FHUc). Initial biological evaluation included in vitro autoradiography in rat with competition with an AChE inhibitor at different concentrations, and microPET-scan on anesthetized rats. In vivo PET studies in anesthetized cat focused on [18\u00a0F]-FHUa.Although radiosynthesis of these huprine analogs was straightforward, they showed poor brain penetration potential, partially reversed after pharmacological inhibition of P-glycoprotein. These results indicated that current huprine analogs are not suitable for PET mapping of brain AChE receptors, but require physicochemical modulation in order to increase brain penetration.",

However, its widespread use is limited by the short physical half-life of the radionuclide and a difficult radiosynthesis. Therefore, a Fluorine-18 labeled analogue, 5-[18F]Fluoro-L-tryptophan ([18F]FTRP), has been proposed as a functional analogue. There is no published method for the synthesis of L-[18F]FTRP. We have therefore developed a synthesis of 5-fluoro-[\u03b2-11C]-L-tryptophan ([11C]FTRP), based on the existing chemo-enzymatic method for [11C]HTP and evaluated the potential usefulness of radiolabeled FTRP as a substitute for [11C]HTP.The in vitro and in vivo behavior of [11C]FTRP, including the dependence of key enzymes in the serotonergic metabolic pathway, was investigated in NET cell lines, NET xenograft carrying immunodeficient mice, normal rats and in non-human primate. [11C]HTP was used for direct comparison.Uptake of [11C]FTRP in NET cell lines in vitro was mediated by enzymes involved in serotonin synthesis and metabolism, similar to [11C]HTP. In vivo biodistribution, either in rodent or non-human primate, was not affected by selectively inhibiting enzymatic steps in the serotonergic metabolic pathway.[11C]FTRP has in vitro biological function similar to that of [11C]HTP. However, this function is not retained in vivo as shown by biodistribution and PET/CT studies.

The final version of the PPI will be integrated into the MONICA portable dual-gamma camera system to allow the user to interchangeably image either single photon or positron-emitting compounds in a shared software and hardware environment.A mouse is placed in the mid-plane between two identical, opposed, pixelated LYSO arrays separated by 21.8-cm and in time coincidence. An image of the distribution of positron decays in the animal is formed on this mid-plane by coincidence events that fall within a small cone angle perpendicular to the two detectors and within a user-specified energy window. We measured the imaging performance of this device with phantoms and in tests performed in mice injected with various compounds labeled with positron-emitting isotopes.Representative performance measurements yielded the following results (energy window 250\u2013650\u00a0keV, cone angle 3.5\u00b0): resolution in the image mid-plane, 1.66-mm (FWHM), resolution \u00b1\u00a01.5-cm above and below the image plane, 2.2-mm (FWHM), sensitivity: 0.237-cps/kBq (8.76-cps/\u03bcCi) 18F (0.024% absolute).

For comparison, the NET transport kinetics and binding affinities of some [3H]-labeled biogenic amines were also determined.Transport kinetics studies were performed using rat C6 glioma cells stably transfected with the human norepinephrine transporter (C6-hNET cells). For each radiolabeled NET substrate, saturation transport assays with C6-hNET cells measured the Michaelis\u2013Menten transport constants Km and Vmax for NET transport. Competitive inhibition binding assays with homogenized C6-hNET cells and [3H]mazindol provided estimates of binding affinities (KI) for NET.Km, Vmax and KI values were determined for each NET substrate with a high degree of reproducibility. Interestingly, C6-hNET transport rates for \u2018tracer concentrations\u2019 of substrate, given by the ratio Vmax/Km, were found to be highly correlated with neuronal transport rates measured previously in isolated rat hearts (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.96). This suggests that the transport constants Km and Vmax measured using the C6-hNET cells accurately reflect in vivo transport kinetics.The results of these studies show how structural changes in NET substrates influence NET binding and transport constants, providing valuable insights that can be used in the design of new tracers with more optimal kinetics for quantifying regional sympathetic nerve density.",

Time-activity curves revealed that both 64Cu-ATSM and 64Cu-ATSE showed rapid entry and efflux from the brain, but did not show significant accumulation in the lesion. 18F-FAZA showed limited brain penetration, and accumulation in the lesion was inconsistent, low and as slow as 18F-FMISO.This study suggests further development of these radiotracers as hypoxia markers for ischemic stroke may not be warranted.",

However, as copper has previously been found in high concentrations in human tumor tissue in vivo, instability of PET tracers could result in tumor accumulation of non-tracer-bound radioactive copper that may influence PET measurements. Here we determine the degree of 64Cu uptake in five commonly used human cancer xenograft models in mice. Additionally, we compare copper accumulation in tumor tissue to gene expression of human copper transporter 1 (CTR1).Small animal PET scans were performed on five different human cancer xenograft mice models 1\u00a0h and 22\u00a0h post injection (p.i.) of 64CuCl2. Regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn on tumor tissue and sections of various organs on all images. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) gene expression measurements of CTR1 were performed on tumor samples obtained after the 22\u00a0h scan.A relatively high tumor uptake of 64Cu was seen in four out of five tumor types and an increase in 64Cu accumulation was seen in three out of five tumor types between 1\u00a0h and 22\u00a0h p.i. No relationship was found between tumor uptake of 64Cu and gene expression of CTR1.The relatively high, time- and tumor type dependent 64Cu uptake demonstrated here in five different human cancer xenograft models in mice, emphasizes the importance of validating tracer uptake and indicates that high in vivo stability of copper-based PET tracers is of particular importance because non-tracer-bound copper can accumulate in tumor tissue to a level that could potentially lead to misinterpretation of PET data.",

Microscopic fluorescence imaging of harvested tumor indicated that the uptake of PC-1001 was restricted to viable rather than necrotic tumor cells.A highly efficient tumor-targeting PET/fluorescence imaging probe PC-1001 is synthesized and validated in vitro in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and in vivo in mice breast cancer xenograft model.",

     "abstract": "Sampling of arterial blood for metabolite correction is often required to define a true radiotracer input function in quantitative modeling of PET data. However, arterial puncture for blood sampling is often undesirable. To establish whether venous blood could substitute for arterial blood in metabolite analysis for quantitative PET studies with 1-[11C]acetate and 1-[11C]palmitate, we compared the results of [11C]CO2-metabolite analyses performed on simultaneously collected arterial and venous blood samples.Paired arterial and venous blood samples were drawn from anesthetized pigs at 1, 3, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30\u00a0min after i.v. administration of 1-[11C]acetate and 1-[11C]palmitate. Blood radioactivity present as [11C]CO2 was determined employing a validated 10-min gas-purge method. Briefly, total blood 11C radioactivity was counted in base-treated [11C]-blood samples, and non-[11C]CO2 radioactivity was counted after the [11C]-blood was acidified using 6\u00a0N HCl and bubbled with air for 10\u00a0min to quantitatively remove [11C]CO2.An excellent correlation was found between concurrent arterial and venous [11C]CO2 levels. For the [11C]acetate study, the regression equation derived to estimate the venous [11C]CO2 from the arterial values was: y\u00a0=\u00a00.994x\u00a0+\u00a00.004 (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.97), and for the [11C]palmitate: y\u00a0=\u00a00.964x\u00a0\u2212\u00a00.001 (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.9). Over the 1\u201330\u00a0min period, the fraction of total blood 11C present as [11C]CO2 rose from 4% to 64% for acetate, and 0% to 24% for palmitate. The rate of [11C]CO2 appearance in venous blood appears similar for the pig model and humans following i.v. [11C]-acetate administration.Venous blood [11C]CO2 values appear suitable as substitutes for arterial blood samples in [11C]CO2 metabolite analysis after administration of [11C]acetate or [11C]palmitateQuantitative PET studies employing 1-[11C]acetate and 1-[11C]palmitate can employ venous blood samples for metabolite correction of an image-derived tracer arterial input function, thereby avoiding the risks of direct arterial blood sampling.",

This is known as the serum protein binding displacement method. In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetic alteration of technetium-99m-labeled mercaptoacetylglycylglycylglycine (99mTc-MAG3) using the serum protein binding displacement method.Rat and human serum protein binding rates of 99mTc-MAG3 were measured by ultrafiltration with or without displacers of human serum albumin (HSA) binding sites I and II (200\u00a0\u03bcM and 400\u00a0\u03bcM loading). Male Wistar rats were injected with 99mTc-MAG3 (740\u00a0kBq/0.3\u00a0mL saline) via the tail vein, and biodistribution was assessed at 2, 5, 10 and 15\u00a0min. Dynamic whole-body images were obtained for 99mTc-MAG3 (11.1\u00a0MBq/0.3\u00a0mL saline)-injected rats, with or without HSA displacers.99mTc-MAG3 strongly bound to HSA (87.37%\u00b12.13%). Using HSA site I displacers, the free fraction of 99mTc-MAG3 increased significantly (1.20 to 1.47 times) when compared with controls. For biodistribution and imaging, rapid blood clearance was observed with bucolome (BCL) loading, which is an HSA site I displacer. With BCL loading, peak times for rat renograms were respectively shifted from 240\u00a0s to 110\u00a0s, and from 170\u00a0s to 120\u00a0s.We found that 99mTc-MAG3 bound to the HSA binding site I. It was confirmed that pharmacokinetic distribution of 99mTc-MAG3 is altered by presence of BCL, which leads to increases in the free fraction of 99mTc-MAG3, and BCL produced rapid blood clearance and fast peak times on rat renograms. The serum protein binding displacement method using 99mTc-MAG3 and BCL, a safe displacer for humans, may be applicable to clinical study and lead to better diagnostic images with shorter waiting times and lower radiation doses for patients.",

However, routine applications in patients and longitudinal designs are largely missing despite widespread attempts in healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to apply a previously validated approach to a clinical sample of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) before and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).Eleven scans from 5 patients with venous blood sampling were obtained with the radioligand [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 at baseline, before and after 11.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2 ECT sessions. IDIFs were defined by two different image reconstruction algorithms 1) OSEM with subsequent partial volume correction (OSEM\u00a0+\u00a0PVC) and 2) reconstruction based modelling of the point spread function (TrueX). Serotonin-1A receptor (5-HT1A) binding potentials (BPP, BPND) were quantified with a two-tissue compartment (2TCM) and reference region model (MRTM2).Compared to MRTM2, good agreement in 5-HT1A BPND was found when using input functions from OSEM\u00a0+\u00a0PVC (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.82) but not TrueX (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.57, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), which is further reflected by lower IDIF peaks for TrueX (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Following ECT, decreased 5-HT1A BPND and BPP were found with the 2TCM using OSEM\u00a0+\u00a0PVC (23%\u201335%), except for one patient showing only subtle changes. In contrast, MRTM2 and IDIFs from TrueX gave unstable results for this patient, most probably due to a 2.4-fold underestimation of non-specific binding.Using image-derived and venous input functions defined by OSEM with subsequent PVC we confirm previously reported decreases in 5-HT1A binding in MDD patients after ECT. In contrast to reference region modeling, quantification with image-derived input functions showed consistent results in a clinical setting due to accurate modeling of non-specific binding with OSEM\u00a0+\u00a0PVC.",

     "abstract": "Affibody molecules, small scaffold proteins, have demonstrated an appreciable potential as imaging probes. Affibody molecules are composed of three alpha-helices. Helices 1 and 2 are involved in molecular recognition, while helix 3 provides stability. The size of Affibody molecules can be reduced by omitting the third alpha-helix and cross-linking the two remaining, providing a smaller molecule with better extravasation and quicker clearance of unbound tracer. The goal of this study was to develop a novel 2-helix Affibody molecule based on backbone cyclization by native chemical ligation (NCL).The HER2-targeting NCL-cyclized Affibody molecule ZHER2:342min has been designed, synthesized and site-specifically conjugated with a DOTA chelator. DOTA-ZHER2:342min was labeled with 111In and 68\u00a0Ga. The binding affinity of DOTA-ZHER2:342min was evaluated in vitro. The targeting properties of 111In- and 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:342min were evaluated in mice bearing SKOV-3 xenografts and compared with the properties of 111In- and 68\u00a0Ga-labeled PEP09239, a DOTA-conjugated 2-helix Affibody analogue cyclized by a homocysteine disulfide bridge.The dissociation constant (KD) for DOTA-ZHER2:342min binding to HER2 was 18\u00a0nM according to SPR measurements. DOTA-ZHER2:342min was labeled with 111In and 68\u00a0Ga. Both conjugates demonstrated bi-phasic binding kinetics to HER2-expressing cells, with KD1 in low nanomolar range. Both variants demonstrated specific uptake in HER2-expressing xenografts. Tumor-to-blood ratios at 2\u00a0h p.i. were 6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 for 111In- DOTA-ZHER2:342min and 4.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 for 68\u00a0Ga-DOTA-ZHER2:342min. However, the uptake of DOTA-ZHER2:342min in lung, liver and spleen was appreciably higher than the uptake of PEP09239-based counterparts.Native chemical ligation enables production of a backbone-cyclized HER2-binding 2-helix Affibody molecule (ZHER2:342min) with low nanomolar target affinity and specific tumor uptake.",

This paper describes and evaluates the initial evaluation of the 18F-labeled Lactosome as a novel contrast agent for the tumor PET imaging technique carried out.18F-labeled Lactosomes were prepared by a film hydration method under sonication in water at 50\u00a0\u00b0C from a mixture of 4-[18F]fluoro-benzoyl poly-L-lactic acid (18F-BzPLLA30) and the amphiphilic polydepsipeptide. For biodistribution studies, BALB/cA Jcl-nu/nu mice bearing HeLa cells in the femur region were used. We took both PET and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) images of tumor bearing mice after co-injection of 18F-labeled Lactosome and NIRF-labeled Lactosome.18F-labeled Lactosomes were prepared at good yields (222\u2013420\u00a0MBq) and more than 99% of 18F-BzPLLA30 was incorporated into 18F-labeled Lactosome. The radioactivity of 18F-labeled Lactosome was found to be stable and maintained at high level for up to 6\u00a0h after injection into the blood stream. Tumor uptake increased gradually after the injection. The uptake ratio of tumor/muscle was 2.7 at 6\u00a0h from the time of injection. Tumor PET imaging with 18F-labeled Lactosome was as capable as tumor NIRF imaging with NIRF-labeled Lactosome.Tumor PET imaging using Lactosome as a nanocarrier may be therefore a potential candidate for a facile and general solid tumor imaging technique.",

Baseline and pre-blocking experiments with multiple doses of preladenant (0.01\u20131.2\u00a0mg/kg), a highly selective A2A antagonist, were performed in cynomolgus monkeys.Following bolus intravenous (i.v.) injection, [123I]MNI-420 rapidly entered the non-human primate brain. The regional brain accumulation of [123I]MNI-420 matched the known distribution of A2A receptors in brain (highest in the striatum).

Synthesis of [18F]FBA usually involves application of strong reducing agents like LiAlH4 which is challenging to handle in automated synthesis units (ASUs). Therefore, alternative methods for the preparation of [18F]FBA compatible with remotely-controlled syntheses in ASUs are needed.18F]FBA was prepared in a remotely-controlled synthesis unit (GE TRACERlab\u2122 FX) based on Ni(II)-mediated borohydride exchange resin (BER) reduction of 4-[18F]fluorobenzonitrile ([18F]FBN). [18F]FBA was used for the synthesis of novel thiol-reactive prosthetic group 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl)maleimide [18F]FBM and Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(4-[18F]fluorobenzylamino)-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin [18F] GA.[18F]FBA could be prepared in high radiochemical yield greater than 80% (decay-corrected) within 60\u00a0min. In a typical experiment, 7.4\u00a0GBq of [18F]FBA could be obtained in high radiochemical purity of greater than 95% starting from 10\u00a0GBq of cyclotron-produced n.c.a. [18F]fluoride. [18F]FBA was used for the preparation of 4-[18F]fluorobenzyl)maleimide as a novel prosthetic group for labeling of thiol groups as demonstrated with tripeptide glutathione. [18F]FBA was also used as building block for the syntheses of small molecules as exemplified by the preparation of Hsp90 inhibitor 17-(4-[18F]fluorobenzylamino)-17-demethoxy-geldanamycin.The described remotely-controlled synthesis of [18F]FBA will significantly improve the availability of [18F]FBA as an important and versatile building block for the development of novel 18F-labeled compounds containing a fluorobenzylamine moiety.",

Recently, as an alternative treatment modality for HCC, transcatheter arterial embolization with radioisotopes has been investigated. In this study, we compared the therapeutic efficacy of an intra-hepatic arterial injection of Re-188-MN-16ET-lipiodol and the TACE method in rats with liver tumors.Twelve male rats bearing hepatic tumors were divided into three groups to evaluate the efficacy of treatment (four in each group). Group 1 received an intra-hepatic arterial injection of 0.2\u00a0mCi of Re-188-MN-16ET-lipiodol; group 2 received epirubicin (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) and 0.1\u00a0ml of lipiodol emulsion; group 3 received 0.1\u00a0ml of normal saline and served as the control group. Tumor size was measured by liver sonography before injection, at two weeks, four weeks and eight weeks after injection. Survival time was calculated from the day of treatment to 56\u00a0days after treatment by the life-table method. The response to treatment and the survival time in each group were evaluated and compared.All rats treated with Re-188 MN-16ET-lipiodol showed good response to the therapy. Their tumor size decreased and all rats survived over eight weeks. All rats treated with epirubicin plus lipiodol survived over 8\u00a0weeks; however, two rats (50%) showed increased tumor size in the 8th week. As for the control group (rats treated with normal saline), all rats survived less than 37\u00a0days with continuous tumor growth.Results showed that Re-188-MN-16ET-lipiodol can be a potential therapeutic pharmaceutical for the treatment of liver tumors.",

A properly protected compound not jeopardized by earlier published results is a must. A guarantee of an easy and secured source of the ligand is obvious. A safe access to the radionuclide in volumes corresponding to the targeted market is rarely taken into account, but of utmost importance.The evaluation of new drugs by investors will include the evaluation of the real market size for the targeted indication and the position of the drug in the healthcare environment at the time to market. This includes the potential competition with other radiopharmaceuticals, but also with conventional drugs or competitive modalities also at time to market. Both criteria are usually not easily accessible to researchers whose acquaintance remains limited to the scientific and technical part. Starting from this set of information, a first business plan can be deduced based on a best estimate for price per dose and a rough evaluation about the chance and level of reimbursement.

     "abstract": "Several strategies for the effective separation of 99mTc from 99Mo have been developed and validated. Due to the success of column chromatographic separation using acidic alumina coupled with high specific activity fission 99Mo (F 99Mo) for production of 99Mo/99mTc generators, however, most technologies until recently have generated little interest. The reduced availability of F 99Mo and consequently the shortage of 99Mo/99mTc column generators in the recent past have resurrected interest in the production of 99Mo as well as 99mTc by alternate routes. Most of these alternative production processes require separation techniques capable of providing clinical grade 99mTc from low specific activity 99Mo or irradiated Mo targets. For this reason there has been renewed interest in alternate separation routes. This paper reviews the reported separation technologies which include column chromatography, solvent extraction, sublimation and gel systems that have been traditionally used for the fabrication of 99Mo/99mTc generator systems. The comparative advantage, disadvantage, and technical challenges toward adapting the emerging requirements are discussed. New developments such as solid-phase column extraction, electrochemical separation, extraction chromatography, supported liquid membrane (SLM) and thermochromatographic techniques are also being evaluated for their potential application in the changed scenario of providing 99mTc from alternate routes. Based on the analysis provided in this review, it appears that some proven separation technologies can be quickly resurrected for the separation of clinical grade 99mTc from macroscopic levels of reactor or cyclotron irradiated molybdenum targets. Furthermore, emerging technologies can be developed further to respond to the expected changing modes of 99mTc production.",

     "abstract": "In spite of recently approved B-RAF inhibitors and immunomodulating antibodies, metastatic melanoma has poor prognosis and novel treatments are needed. Melanoma stem cells (MSC) have been implicated in the resistance of this tumor to chemotherapy. Recently we demonstrated in a Phase I clinical trial in patients with metastatic melanoma that radioimmunotherapy (RIT) with 188-Rhenium(188Re)-6D2 antibody to melanin was a safe and effective modality. Here we investigated the interaction of MSC with RIT as a possible mechanism for RIT efficacy.Mice bearing A2058 melanoma xenografts were treated with either 1.5\u00a0mCi 188Re-6D2 antibody, saline, unlabeled 6D2 antibody or 188Re-labeled non-specific IgM.On Day 28 post-treatment the tumor size in the RIT group was 4-times less than in controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and FACS for two MSC markers \u2014 chemoresistance mediator ABCB5 and H3K4 demethylase JARID1B. There were no significant differences between RIT and control groups in percentage of ABCB5 or JARID1B-positive cells in the tumor population. Our results demonstrate that unlike chemotherapy, which kills tumor cells but leaves behind MSC leading to recurrence, RIT kills MSC at the same rate as the rest of tumor cells.These results have two main implications for melanoma treatment and possibly other cancers. First, the susceptibility of ABCB5\u00a0+ and JARID1B\u00a0+\u00a0cells to RIT in melanoma might be indicative of their susceptibility to antibody-targeted radiation in other cancers where they are present as well. Second, specifically targeting cancer stem cells with radiolabeled antibodies to ABCB5 or JARID1B might help to completely eradicate cancer stem cells in various cancers.",

RGD-BBN was conjugated with S-benzoylmercaptoacetylglycylglycyl (MAG2), and then labeled with 99mTc or 188Re, respectively. The dual-receptor binding affinity of MAG2-RGD-BBN was investigated by a radioligand competition binding assay. Biodistribution study of 188Re-MAG2-RGD-BBN was carried out in normal BALB/c mice and PC-3 human prostate tumor-bearing nude mice. Gamma imaging studies were performed in PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice. Biodistribution in normal mice showed that both 99mTc and 188Re-labeled MAG2-RGD-BBN possessed high pancreas uptake due to the high GRPR expression of this organ. Gamma imaging with both 99mTc and 188Re-labeled RGD-BBN in PC-3 tumor-bearing nude mice demonstrated high tumor uptake. The PC-3 tumors were clearly visible at 1 postinjection, with high contrast to the contralateral background. The use of chelator MAG2 enables successful and high-yield 99mTc and 188Re radiolabeling of RGD-BBN with favorable tumor targeting specificity. Further optimization may allow potential clinical application of 188Re-MAG2-RGD-BBN for tumor-targeted radionuclide therapy.",

The 68Ga-complex of NOTA-NCS demonstrated high in vitro stability even in the presence of 1000 times molar excess of metal ions (such as Fe, Cu, Zn and Ca ions). In contrast, other 68Ga-labeled BFCs (DTPA-NCS, DOTA-NCS and PCTA-NCS) showed reduced radiochemical yields when incubated with the above concentration of metal ions. The biodistribution studies in Swiss mice revealed that 68Ga-NOTA-NCS cleared rapidly through the kidneys with minimum retention in any major organ.The simple and rapid approach for preparation of 68Ga-radiopharmaceuticals using NOTA based bifunctional chelators would render 68Ga-radiopharmaceutical chemistry more convenient with minimum interference from other metal ion impurities; and increase the scope of making 68Ga based agents for PET imaging.",

The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of normal organs and the main tumor site was measured. Differences in SUVmax in patients with and without elevated BGLs, diabetes, insulin treatment, and obesity were compared and analyzed for statistical significance.Increased BGLs were associated with decreased cerebral FDG uptake and increased uptake in skeletal muscle. Diabetes and insulin diminished this effect, whereas obesity slightly enhanced the outcome. Diabetes and insulin also increased the average SUVmax in muscle cells and fat, whereas the mean cerebral SUVmax was reduced. Obesity decreased tracer uptake in several healthy organs by up to 30%. Tumoral uptake was not significantly influenced by BGL, diabetes, insulin, or obesity.Changes in BGLs, diabetes, insulin, and obesity affect the FDG biodistribution in muscular tissue and the brain. Although tumoral uptake is not significantly impaired, these findings may influence the tumor detection rate and are therefore essential for diagnosis and follow-up of malignant diseases.",

Strong \u03b1v\u03b26-targeted binding was observed in vitro (DX3puro\u03b26 cells, 15\u00a0min: 43.2% binding, >\u00a06:1 for DX3puro\u03b26:DX3puro). In the mouse model DX3puro\u03b26-tumor binding was low (1\u00a0h: 0.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28% ID/g, 4\u00a0h: 0.14\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.09% ID/g) and clearing from the bloodstream was via the renal and hepatobiliary routes (urine: 167\u00a0\u00b1\u00a084% ID/g at 1\u00a0h, 10.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.8% ID/g at 4\u00a0h; gall bladder: 95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a033% ID/g at 1\u00a0h, 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011% ID/g at 4\u00a0h).Copper-free, strain-promoted click chemistry is an attractive, straightforward approach to radiolabeling. Although the [18F]FBA-C6-ADBIO-based prosthetic group did not interfere with \u03b1v\u03b26-targeted binding in vitro, it did influence the pharmacokinetics, possibly due to its size and lipophilic nature.",

Longitudinal [11C]4DST uptake was evaluated by the tissue dissection method at 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14\u00a0days after turpentine injection (n\u00a0=\u00a05). The tumor selectivity index was calculated using the previously published biodistribution data in C6 glioma-bearing rats. Dynamic PET scan was performed on day 4 when maximum [11C]4DST uptake was observed during the longitudinal study. Histopathological analysis and Ki-67 immunostaining were also performed.The uptake of [11C]4DST in inflammatory tissue was significantly increased on days 2\u20134 after turpentine injection, and then decreased. On day 14, tracer uptake returned to the day 1 level. The maximum SUV of inflamed muscle was 0.6 and was 3 times higher than that of the contralateral healthy muscle on days 2\u20134 after turpentine injection. However, tumor selectivity index remains very high (>\u00a010) because of the low inflammation uptake. A dynamic PET scan showed that the radioactivity in inflammatory tissues peaked at 5\u00a0min after [11C]4DST injection, and then washed out until 20\u00a0min. At intervals >\u00a020\u00a0min, radioactivity levels were constant and double that of healthy muscle. The changes in Ki-67 index were paralleled with those of [11C]4DST uptake, indicating cell proliferation-dependent uptake of [11C]4DST in inflammatory tissues.In our animal model, low but significant levels of [11C]4DST uptake were observed in subacute inflammation.",

In this study, we conjugated a peptidomimetic ligand known to have good binding affinity for \u03b14\u03b21 integrin to a cross-bridged macrocyclic chelator with a methane phosphonic acid pendant arm, CB-TE1A1P. CB-TE1A1P-LLP2A was labeled with 64Cu under mild conditions in high specific activity, in contrast to conjugates based on the \u201cgold standard\u201d di-acid cross-bridged chelator, CB-TE2A, which require high temperatures for efficient radiolabeling. Saturation binding assays demonstrated that 64Cu-CB-TE1A1P-LLP2A had comparable binding affinity (1.2 nM vs 1.6 nM) but more binding sites (Bmax\u00a0=\u00a0471 fmol/mg) in B16F10 melanoma tumor cells than 64Cu-CB-TE2A-LLP2A (Bmax\u00a0=\u00a0304 fmol/mg, p\u00a0<\u00a00.03).

The aim of this study was to assess binding of the novel radioligand [11C]methyl-candesartan to AT1 receptors in the rat kidney in vivo with PET.Dynamic PET images were acquired for 60\u00a0min at baseline, with coinjection of candesartan (5\u00a0mg/kg), and after injection of PD123,319 (5\u00a0mg/kg). Volumes of distribution (RC\u2219\u00a0VT) were estimated with a two-compartment model, by Logan analysis, and by taking the tissue-to-plasma activity ratio at 50\u201360\u00a0min post-injection.The two-compartment model did not describe the kinetics at baseline adequately and the baseline scans were too short to obtain accurate estimates of RC\u2219\u00a0VT with the Logan approach. Based on the tissue-to-plasma ratios, roughly one-third of VT at baseline could be attributed to AT1 receptor binding. There were no indications of AT2 receptor binding in the rat kidney.It may be possible to detect changes in AT1 receptor density in the rat kidney in vivo with [11C]methyl-candesartan and PET. Imaging AT1 receptors with PET may provide valuable information on the role of these receptors in the pathogenesis of diseases such as hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, ventricular remodeling, and heart failure.",

     "abstract": "Radiolabeled RGD peptides that specifically target integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 have great potential in early tumor detection through noninvasive monitoring of tumor angiogenesis. Based on previous findings of our group on radiopeptides containing positively charged aminoacids, we developed a new cyclic cRGDfK derivative, c(RGDfK)-(Orn)3-CGG. This new peptide availing the polar linker (Orn)3 and the 99mTc-chelating moiety CGG (Cys-Gly-Gly) is appropriately designed for 99mTc-labeling, as well as consequent conjugation onto nanoparticles.A tumor imaging agent, c(RGDfK)-(Orn)3-[CGG-99mTc], is evaluated with regard to its radiochemical, radiobiological and imaging characteristics.The complex c(RGDfK)-(Orn)3-[CGG-99mTc] was obtained in high radiochemical yield (>\u00a098%) and was stable in vitro and ex vivo. It presented identical to the respective, fully analytically characterized 185/187Re complex retention time in RP-HPLC. In contrary to other RGD derivatives, we showed that the new radiopeptide exhibits kidney uptake and urine excretion due to the ornithine linker. High tumor uptake (3.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.48% ID/g at 60\u00a0min p.i.) was observed and was maintained relatively high even at 24\u00a0h p.i. (1.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05 % ID/g), thus providing well-defined scintigraphic imaging. Accumulation in other organs was negligible. Blocking experiments indicated target specificity for integrin receptors in U87MG glioblastoma cells.Due to its relatively high tumor uptake, renal elimination and negligible abdominal localization, the new 99mTc-RGD peptide is considered promising in the field of imaging \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23-positive tumors. However, the preparation of multifunctional SPECT/MRI contrast agents (RGD-conjugated nanoparticles) for dual modality imaging of integrin expressing tumors should be further investigated.",

Biodistribution in animals bearing induced 3LL Lewis murine lung carcinoma was studied. Comparison with [18F]FMISO is also presented.Nit1 and Nit2 have been successfully synthesized. Labelling in high radiochemical purity was achieved for both ligands. Complexes are stable in labelling milieu for at least four hours and in human plasma or in the presence of an excess of DTPA for at least two hours. Both compounds showed high uptake in hypoxic cells in vitro and a very favourable biodistribution profile in mice bearing induced tumours.

     "abstract": "[18F]Nifene is a novel radiotracer specific to the nicotinic acetylcholine \u03b14\u03b22 receptor class. In preparation for using this tracer in humans we have performed whole-body PET studies in mice to evaluate the in vivo biodistribution and dosimetry of [18F]Nifene.Seven BALB/c mice (3 males, 4 females) received IV tail injections of [18F]Nifene and were scanned for 2\u00a0h in an Inveon dedicated PET scanner. Each animal also received a high resolution CT scan using an Inveon CT. The CT images were used to draw volume of interest (VOI) on the following organs: brain, large intestine, small intestine, stomach, heart, kidneys, liver, lungs, pancreas, bone, spleen, testes, thymus, uterus and urinary bladder. All organ time activity curves had the decay correction reversed and were normalized to the injected activity. The area under the normalized curves was then used to compute the residence times in each organ. The absorbed doses in mouse organs were computed using the RAdiation Dose Assessment Resource (RADAR) animal models for dose assessment. The residence times in mouse organs were converted to human values using scale factors based on differences between organ and body weights. OLINDA 1.1 software was used to compute the absorbed human doses in multiple organs for both female and male phantoms.The highest mouse residence times were found in urinary bladder, liver, bone, small intestine and kidneys. The largest doses in mice were found in urinary bladder and kidneys for both females and males. The elimination of radiotracer was primarily via kidney and urinary bladder with the urinary bladder being the limiting organ. The projected human effective doses were 1.51E-02\u00a0mSv/MBq for the adult male phantom and 1.65E-02\u00a0mSv/MBq for the adult female model phantom.This study indicates that the whole-body mouse imaging can be used as a preclinical tool for initial estimation of the absorbed doses of [18F]Nifene in humans.",

     "abstract": "The temporal variations in absorbed dose rates to organs and tissues in the body are very large in diagnostic and therapeutic nuclear medicine. The response of biological endpoints of relevance to radiation safety and therapeutic efficacy is generally modulated by dose rate. Therefore, it is important to understand how the complex dose rate patterns encountered in nuclear medicine impact relevant biological responses. Accordingly, a graphical user interface (GUI) was created to control a cesium-137 irradiator to deliver such dose rate patterns.Visual Basic 6.0 was used to create a user-friendly GUI to control the dose rate by varying the thickness of a mercury attenuator. The GUI facilitates the delivery of a number of dose rate patterns including constant, exponential increase or decrease, and multi-component exponential. Extensive visual feedback is provided by the GUI during both the planning and delivery stages.The GUI controlled irradiator can achieve a maximum dose rate of 40\u00a0cGy/h and a minimum dose rate of 0.01\u00a0cGy/h. Addition of machined lead blocks can be used to further reduce the minimum dose rate to 0.0001\u00a0cGy/h. Measured dose rate patterns differed from programmed dose rate patterns in total dose by 3.2% to 8.4%.The GUI controlled irradiator is able to accurately create dose rate patterns encountered in nuclear medicine and other related fields. This makes it an invaluable tool for studying the effects of chronic constant and variable low dose rates on biological tissues in the contexts of both radiation protection and clinical administration of internal radionuclides.",

The probe was evaluated pre-clinically in four tumor xenograft models: one studied treatment with paclitaxel to trigger the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, and three others interrogated treatment with an agonistic death-receptor monoclonal antibody to engage the extrinsic apoptotic pathway.High accumulation of 89Zr-PGN635 was observed in treated tumors undergoing apoptosis reaching 30 %ID/g and tumor-to-blood ratios up to 13.

While diagnostic nuclear medicine for cancer management is fairly well established, therapeutic strategies using radionuclides are yet to be utilized to their full potential. Even if 1% of the patients undergoing diagnostic nuclear medicine procedures can benefit from subsequent nuclear therapeutic intervention, the radionuclide requirement for nuclear therapeutics would be expected to be in the multi-million Curie levels. Meeting the demand for such high levels of therapeutic radionuclides at an affordable price is an important task for the success of radionuclide therapy. Although different types of particle emitters (beta, alpha, Auger electron etc.) have been evaluated for treating a wide variety of diseases, the use of \u03b2\u2212 emitting radionuclides is most feasible owing to their ease of production and availability. Several \u03b2\u2212 emitting radionuclides have been successfully used to treat different kind of diseases. However, many of these radionuclides are not suitable to meet the projected demand owing to the non-availability with sufficiently high specific activity and adequate quantity because of high production costs, relatively short half-lives etc. This article describes the advantages and disadvantages for broader uses of some of the well known therapeutic radionuclides.

CD-1 athymic nude mice bearing M21/M21L human melanoma xenografts were used for biodistribution studies, blockade experiments, metabolite studies and PET imaging. 68\u00a0Ga-TRAP(RGD)3 exhibited high M21 tumor uptake (6.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.63% ID/g, 60\u00a0min p.i.), was found to be fully stable in vivo, and showed a fast renal clearance. Blockade studies showed that uptake in the tumor, as well as in all other tissues, is highly integrin specific. A comparison of biodistribution and PET data of 68\u00a0Ga-TRAP(RGD)3 with those of 68\u00a0Ga-NODAGA-c(RGDyK) and 18\u00a0F-Galacto-RGD showed that the higher affinity of the trimer effects a larger dynamic response of tracer uptake to integrin expression, i.e., enhanced integrin-specific uptake in all tissues. We conclude that 68\u00a0Ga-TRAP(RGD)3 could allow for imaging of low-level integrin expression in tissues which are not visible with the two competitors. Overall, the study constitutes proof of concept for the favourable in vivo properties of TRAP-based 68\u00a0Ga radiopharmaceuticals.",

     "abstract": "A robust, versatile and compact microreactor has been designed, fabricated and tested for the labeling of bifunctional chelate conjugated biomolecules (BFC-BM) with PET radiometals.The developed microreactor was used to radiolabel a chelate, either 1,4,7,10-Tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA) or 1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid (NOTA) that had been conjugated to cyclo(Arg-Gly-Asp-DPhe-Lys) peptide, with both 64Cu and 68Ga respectively. The microreactor radiolabeling conditions were optimized by varying temperature, concentration and residence time.Direct comparisons between the microreactor approach and conventional methods showed improved labeling yields and increased reproducibility with the microreactor under identical labeling conditions, due to enhanced mass and heat transfer at the microscale. More importantly, over 90% radiolabeling yields (incorporation of radiometal) were achieved with a 1:1 stoichiometry of bifunctional chelate biomolecule conjugate (BFC-BM) to radiometal in the microreactor, which potentially obviates extensive chromatographic purification that is typically required to remove the large excess of unlabeled biomolecule in radioligands prepared using conventional methods. Moreover, higher yields for radiolabeling of DOTA-functionalized BSA protein (Bovine Serum Albumin) were observed with 64Cu/68Ga using the microreactor, which demonstrates the ability to label both small and large molecules.A robust, reliable, compact microreactor capable of chelating radiometals with common chelates has been developed and validated. Based on our radiolabeling results, the reported microfluidic approach overall outperforms conventional radiosynthetic methods, and is a promising technology for the radiometal labeling of commonly utilized BFC-BM in aqueous solutions.",

This provided motivation for the generation of HER2-specific 5F7GGC Nb, its radioiodination and evaluation for targeting HER2 expressing tumors.5F7GGC Nb was radioiodinated with 125I using Iodogen and with 131I using the residualizing agent N\u025b-(3-[131I]iodobenzoyl)-Lys5-N\u03b1-maleimido-Gly1-GEEEK ([131I]IB-Mal-d-GEEEK) used previously successfully with intact antibodies.

The aim of this study was to synthesize and evaluate two RGD peptides containing alternative chelating systems, namely [68Ga]NS3-RGD and [68Ga]Oxo-DO3A-RGD and to compare their in vitro and in vivo properties with [68Ga]DOTA- and [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD.Syntheses of both radiotracers followed standard SPPS protocols. For in vitro characterization distribution coefficients, protein binding abilities, serum stabilities, and \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin binding affinities were determined. For in vitro tests as well as for the biodistribution assay \u03b1v\u03b23 positive human melanoma M21 and \u03b1v\u03b23 negative M21-L cells were used.68Ga-labeling of NS3-RGD resulted in good radiochemical purity, whereas HPLC analysis showed two peaks with a ratio of 1:6 for [68Ga]Oxo-DO3A-RGD. Distribution coefficients were \u2212\u00a03.4 for [68Ga]Oxo-DO3A-RGD and \u2212\u00a02.9 for [68Ga]NS3-RGD. Both radiotracers were stable in PBS solution at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 2\u00a0h but lack stability in human serum. Protein binding was approximately 40% of the total activity for [68Ga]NS3-RGD and 70% for [68Ga]Oxo-DO3A-RGD, respectively, resulting in high blood pool activities. Biodistribution assays confirmed these findings and showed an additional high uptake in liver and kidneys, especially for [68Ga]NS3-RGD. Furthermore, [68Ga]Oxo-DO3A-RGD showed nearly the same activity concentrations in \u03b1v\u03b23 positive and \u03b1v\u03b23 negative tumors.[68Ga]Oxo-DO3A-RGD and [68Ga]NS3-RGD have inferior characteristics compared to already existing 68Ga-labeled RGD peptides and thus, both are not suited to image \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin expression. Of all our tested RGD peptides, [68Ga]NODAGA-RGD still possesses the most favorable imaging properties. Moreover this study shows that the use of appropriate chelators to achieve good targeting properties of 68Ga-labeled biomolecules and careful in vitro and in vivo evaluation including comparative studies of different strategies are essential components in designing an effective imaging agent for PET.",

It regulates cell cycle progression, apoptosis and DNA repair mechanisms and is therefore likely to influence response to targeted radionuclide therapy. This study investigated the role of p53 in the cellular response to the Auger-emitting radionuclide indium-111.Two stable clones of a HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line, differing only in p53 status due to RNAi-mediated knockdown of p53 expression, were incubated for 1\u00a0h with [111In]-oxinate (0\u201310\u00a0MBq/ml). Radiopharmaceutical uptake into HT1080 cells was measured in situ using a non-contact phosphorimager method. Cellular sensitivity and DNA damage were measured by, respectively, clonogenic survival analysis and the single cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay.Mean uptake of [111In]-oxinate in HT1080 cells was unaffected by p53 status, reaching a maximum of 9\u00a0Bq/cell. [111In]-oxinate-induced cytotoxicity was also identical in both clones, as measured by IC50 (0.68\u00a0MBq/ml). However the formation of DNA damage, measured immediately after treatment with [111In]-oxinate, was found to be up to 2.5-fold higher in the p53-deficient HT1080 clone.The increased DNA damage induced in p53-deficient HT1080 cells suggests an early deficiency in the repair of DNA damage during the treatment period. However, the similarity in cellular sensitivity, irrespective of p53 status, suggests that reduced p53 leads to a concomitant reduction in p53-dependent cytotoxicity despite the persistence of DNA damage. The results may provide insight into how tumours that differ in p53 status respond to therapeutic radionuclides.",

     "abstract": "Prompt identification of necrosis and apoptosis in the infarct core and penumbra region is critical in acute stroke for delineating the underlying ischemic/reperfusion molecular pathologic events and defining therapeutic alternatives. The objective of this study was to investigate the capability of 99mTc-labeled duramycin in detecting ischemia-reperfusion injury in rat brain after middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion.Ischemic cerebral injury was induced in ten rats by vascular insertion of a nylon suture in the left MCA for 3\u00a0hr followed by 21\u201324\u00a0hr reperfusion. After i.v. injection of 99mTc-duramycin (1.0-3.5\u00a0mCi), dynamic cerebral images were acquired for 1\u00a0hr in six rats using a small-animal SPECT imager. Four other rats were imaged at 2\u00a0hr post-injection. Ex vivo images were obtained by autoradiography after sacrifice. Histologic analyses were performed to assess cerebral infarction and apoptosis.SPECT images showed that 99mTc-duramycin uptake in the left cerebral hemisphere was significantly higher than that in the right at 1 and 2\u00a0hr post-injection. The level of radioactive uptake in the ischemic brain varied based on ischemic severity. The average ratio of left cerebral hot-spot uptake to right hemisphere radioactivity, as determined by computerized ROI analysis, was 4.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79. Fractional washout at 1\u00a0hr was 38.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.5% of peak activity for left cerebral hot-spot areas and 80.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.0% for remote control areas (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Based on triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and autoradiograph image data, the hotspot uptake may be associated primarily with the ischemic penumbra, in which high apoptotic activity was observed by cleaved caspase-3 immunocytochemical staining.99mTc-duramycin SPECT imaging may be useful for detecting and quantifying ongoing apoptotic neuronal cell loss induced by ischemia-reperfusion injury.",

     "abstract": "Invasive aspergillosis is a major cause of infectious morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The fungus Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigatus) is the primary causative agent of invasive aspergillosis. However, A. fumigatus infections remain difficult to diagnose particularly in the early stages due to the lack of a rapid, sensitive and specific diagnostic approach. In this study, we investigated 99mTc labeled MORF oligomers targeting fungal ribosomal RNA (rRNA) for the imaging detection of fungal infections.Three phosphorodiamidate morpholino (MORF) oligomer (a DNA analogue) probes were designed: AGEN, complementary to a sequence of the fungal 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) of Aspergillus, as a genus-specific probe; AFUM, complementary to the 28S rRNA sequence of A. fumigatus, as a fungus species-specific probe; and cMORF, irrelevant to all fungal species, as a control probe. The probes were conjugated with Alexa Fluor 633 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (AF633) for fluorescence imaging or with NHS-mercaptoacetyl triglycine (NHS-MAG3) for nuclear imaging with 99mTc and then evaluated in vitro and in vivo.The specific binding of AGEN and AFUM to fungal total RNA was confirmed by dot blot hybridization while specific binding of AGEN and AFUM in fixed and live A. fumigatus was demonstrated by both fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis and accumulation in live cells. SPECT imaging of BALB/c mice with pulmonary A. fumigatus infections and administered 99mTc labeled AGEN and AFUM showed immediate and obvious accumulation in the infected lungs, while no significant accumulation of the control 99mTc-cMORF in the infected lung was observed. Compared to non-infected mice, with sacrifice at 1\u00a0h, the accumulation of 99mTc-AGEN and 99mTc-AFUM in the lungs of mice infected with A. fumigatus was 2 and 2.7 fold higher respectively.In vivo targeting fungal ribosomal RNA with 99mTc labeled MORF probes AGEN and AFUM may be useful for A. fumigatus infection imaging and may provide a new strategy for the noninvasive diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and other fungal infections.",

We developed a radioiodinated short peptide, AHP7, as a low molecular weight probe for specific OxLDL imaging and evaluated its utility using myocardial infarction-prone Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits (WHHLMI).[125I]AHP7 was designed and synthesized based on the sequence of Asp-hemolysin, an OxLDL binding protein extracted from Aspergillus fumigatus. In vitro binding studies with OxLDL having varying degrees of oxidation were performed. Radioactivity accumulation in the aorta was measured 30\u00a0min post-administration in rabbits.

Further optimization of these fluoropropyl derivatives has now been carried out resulting in 3-(2-(S)-3,4-dehydropyrrolinylmethoxy)-5-(3\u2032-Fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifrolene) as a new high affinity agent for nicotinic \u03b14\u03b22 receptors.

The fluorine-18 analog, 18F-nifrolene, was synthesized in approximately 10%\u201320% yield and specific activity was estimated to be >\u00a02000\u00a0Ci/mmol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding to anterior thalamic nuclei, thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with \u03b14\u03b22 receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >\u00a090% by 300\u00a0\u03bcM nicotine. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio (>\u00a010) was the highest for 18F-nifrolene with several other regions showing selective binding. In vivo rat PET studies exhibited rapid uptake of 18F-nifrolene in the brain with specific retention in the thalamus and other brain regions while clearing out from the cerebellum. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio value in the rat was >\u00a04. Administration of nicotine caused a rapid decline in the thalamic 18F-nifrolene suggesting reversible binding to nicotinic receptors. PET imaging studies of 18F-nifrolene in anesthetized rhesus monkey revealed highest binding in the thalamus followed by regions of the lateral cingulated and temporal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least binding. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio in the monkey brain was >\u00a03 at 120\u00a0min.

Their ability to label high-affinity brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was evaluated.[125I]3-((pyridin-2-yl)methoxy)-5-iodopyridine shows rapid accumulation and elimination with peak (1.86%ID/g) at 5\u00a0min post injection, but has high blood uptake. [125I]3-(((S)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)methoxy)-5-((4-iodobenzyloxy)methyl)pyridine entered the brain with maximal uptake value 3.01%ID/g at 15\u00a0min after injection, and showed approximately 27% inhibition of radioactivity uptake in thalamus in mice pretreated with nicotine.The results of this preliminary study show that [125I]3-(((S)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)methoxy)-5-((4-iodobenzyloxy)methyl)pyridine shows relatively high uptake to the brain, however, since the in vivo selectivity for \u03b14\u03b22 nAChRs was not enough, [125I]3-(((S)-pyrrolidin-2-yl)methoxy)-5-((4-iodobenzyloxy)methyl)pyridine does not have the required properties for imaging nAChRs using SPECT.

Thus, access to positron emission tomography (PET) brain imaging of \u03b11-adrenoceptors could make important contributions to the understanding of psychotic disorders as well as to the pharmacokinetics and occupancy of drugs targeting the \u03b11-adrenoceptors. However, so far no suitable PET radioligand has been developed for brain imaging of \u03b11-adrenoceptors. Here, we report the synthesis of both enantiomers of the desmethyl precursors of the high affinity \u03b11-adrenoceptor ligand Lu AE43936 (1). The two enantiomers of 1 were subsequently [11C] radiolabelled and evaluated for brain uptake and binding by PET imaging in Danish Landrace pigs. (S)-[11C]-1 and (R)-[11C]-1 showed very limited brain uptake. Pre-treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) resulted in a large increase in brain uptake, indicating that (R)-[11C]-1 is a substrate for active efflux-transporters. This was confirmed in Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells overexpressing permeability glycoprotein (Pgp). In conclusion, the limited brain uptake of both (S)-[11C]-1 and (R)-[11C]-1 in the pig brain necessitates the search for alternative radioligands for in vivo PET brain imaging of \u03b11-adrenoceptors.",

In vitro studies included complexation kinetics with Cu(II) using a spectrophotometric method and rat serum stability, while the in vivo biodistribution was evaluated using SCID mice.C-NE3TA and N-NE3TA were labeled at >\u00a095% efficiency up to ~\u00a03.4\u00a0Ci/\u03bcmol. Both C-NE3TA and N-NE3TA formed complexes with Cu(II) almost immediately, with the Cu(II) complexation by C-NE3TA being faster than the formation of Cu(II)-N-NE3TA. Both 64Cu-N-NE3TA and 64Cu-C-NE3TA were 96.1% and 90.5% intact after 48\u00a0h incubation in rat serum, respectively. This is compared to 64Cu complexes of the control chelators, p-NH2-Bn-DOTA and p-NH2-Bn-NOTA, with 93.9% and 97.9% retention of 64Cu in the complex, respectively. In vivo evaluation of 64Cu-N-NE3TA and 64Cu-C-NE3TA demonstrates good clearance from normal tissues except for the liver, where 59% and 51% of the radioactivity is retained at 24\u00a0h compared to 1\u00a0h for 64Cu-N-NE3TA and 64Cu-C-NE3TA, respectively.

We hypothesized that competing sinks like roots and reproductive tissues, as well as vascular architecture, would impact the induction of phenolic defenses of the plant that make use of glucose in glycoside formation by altering distribution and metabolic utilization of 18FDG.Our studies showed that leaf orthostichy defined the major route of 18FDG transport in both vegetative and reproductive plants when a single petiole was cut as the entry point for tracer introduction. However, when nonorthostichous leaves were damaged and treated with MeJA, 18FDG was transported in its intact form to these leaves 3 h later, where it was incorporated into phenolic glycosides.Our work demonstrates a new use for 18FDG in plant science with insights into carbohydrate allocation that contradict conclusions of previous studies showing transport of resources away from damaged sites.",

The present study examined the extent to which ENT1 levels vary in a proliferation-dependent manner in tumor cells in vivo.The human adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was used to establish tumor xenografts in nude mice. FLT uptake was measured in vivo using PET, and further examined ex vivo using autoradiography. FLT uptake patterns were compared to immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of ENT1 and the proliferation markers Ki67 and BrdU.Regional differences in FLT uptake matched differences in IHC proliferation markers. All cells stained for ENT1, but the staining intensity was twice as high for Ki67+ cells than for Ki67\u2212 cells.Under in vivo conditions, proliferating regions of tumors show increased FLT uptake and higher ENT1 levels than nonproliferating tumor regions.",

For semi-quantitative analysis of FDG PET/CT, maximal standardized uptake values (SUVmax) were estimated. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor sections was performed for GLUT-1, GLUT-3, and HK-2, and for the cell proliferation maker Ki-67. Especially, by combining proportions and intensity of immunochemical staining, we evaluated modified immunohistologic scores of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3.The SUVmax of malignant melanoma lesions ranged from 2 to 18.7 (average; 9.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4). Comparison between nodal and extranodal lesions revealed no significant difference of SUVmax (p\u00a0=\u00a00.97). GLUT-1 staining showed the most positive expression level (89.5%, 17/19) among the diverse immunohistochemical markers. There were significant relationships between FDG uptake of malignant melanoma and GLUT-1 proportion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), GLUT-1 intensity (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), GLUT-3 proportion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031), GLUT-3 intensity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), GLUT-1 immunohistologic scores (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), and GLUT-3 immunohistologic scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.028). HK-2 was not expressed in all melanoma samples. Although Ki-67 expression showed a high grade in all staining, there was no significant link between FDG uptake and Ki-67 grades (p\u00a0=\u00a00.38).The data in this preliminary study indicate that FDG uptake in malignant melanoma is determined by GLUT-1 and GLUT-3, whereas HK-2 and Ki-67 play no role in FDG uptake of malignant melanoma.",

The addition of bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid disodium salt to the mixture of copper sulfate/sodium ascorbate also greatly improved the click labeling efficiency. Through exploiting these optimizations, a base-labile NHS ester was rapidly radiosynthesized in 90% isolated yield with good chemical and radiochemical purities.We have developed a general method to click-label small molecules efficiently using [18\u00a0F]2 for research and clinical use.

Further, we have observed that the stability of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-anomers of [18F]-FXAU derivatives differs during the hydrolysis step. Using the microwave-driven heating approach, overall decay-corrected radiochemical yields of 19%\u201327% were achieved for [18F]-FXAU in 120\u00a0min at a specific activity of >\u00a022\u00a0MBq/nmol (595\u00a0Ci/mmol).

However, studies of phosphopeptide action in cells are severely constrained by the negatively charged phosphate moiety of the phosphopeptide resulting in poor transport through the cell membrane. The following study describes the synthesis and radiopharmacological evaluation of two 18F-labeled phosphopeptide-cell-penetrating peptide dimers. The polo-like kinase-1-binding hexaphosphopeptide H-Met-Gln-Ser-pThr-Pro-Leu-OH was coupled to cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), either sC18, a cathelicidin-derived peptide, or the human calcitonin derivative hCT(18-32)-k7.Radiolabeling was accomplished with the prosthetic group N-succinimidyl 4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB) using both, conventional and microfluidic-based bioconjugation of [18F]SFB to N-terminal end of phosphopeptide part of the peptide dimers. Cellular uptake studies in human cancer cell lines HT-29 and FaDu cells at 4 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C and small animal PET in BALB/c mice were utilized for radiopharmacological characterization.Isolated radiochemical yields ranged from 2% to 4% for conventional bioconjugation with [18F]SFB. Significantly improved isolated radiochemical yields of up to 26% were achieved using microfluidic technology. Cellular uptake studies of radiolabeled phosphopeptide and phosphopeptide-CPP dimers indicate enhanced internalization of 50% ID/mg protein after 2 h for both phosphopeptide dimers compared to the phosphopeptide alone (<\u00a01% ID/mg protein). In vivo biodistribution of 18F-labeled peptide dimers was determined with small animal PET revealing a superior biodistribution pattern of sC18-containing peptide dimer MQSpTPL-sC18 [18F]4.[18F]SFB labeling of the phosphopeptide-CPP dimers using a microfluidic system leads to an improved chemoselectivity towards the N-terminal NH2 group compared to the conventional labeling approach. Cell-penetrating peptide sC18 can be considered as an ideal molecular shuttle for intracellular delivery of the Plk1-PBD-binding hexaphosphopeptide as demonstrated by its favourable radiopharmacological profile.",

In this study, we investigated the transport mechanism of 11C-l- and d-MET by analyzing the expression of transport system genes in human-derived tumor cells.The expression of transport system genes in human-derived tumor cells was quantitatively analyzed. The mechanism of MET transport in these cells was investigated by incubating the cells with [S-methyl-3H]-l-MET (3H-l-MET) or [S-methyl-3H]-d-MET (3H-d-MET) and the effect of 2-amino-2- norbornane-carboxylic acid, a system L transport inhibitor, or \u03b1-(methylamino)isobutyric acid, a system A transport inhibitor, on their transport was measured. The transport and metabolic stability of [S-methyl-14C]-l-MET (14C-l-MET) and 3H-d-MET was also analyzed using bearing mice with H441 or PC14 tumor cells.3H-d-MET was mainly transported by both systems L and alanine\u2013serine\u2013cysteine (ASC), while system L was involved in 3H-l-MET transport. There was a high correlation between both 3H-l-MET and 3H-d-MET uptake and the expression of amino acid transport system genes. In the in vivo study, H441-cell accumulation of 3H-d-MET was higher than that of 14C-l-MET. Hepatic and renal accumulation of 3H-d-MET was lower than that of 14C-l-MET.The transport mechanism of 3H-d-MET was different from that of 3H-l-MET.

Recent vivo studies suggest that [99mTc]Glucarate could be helpful for tumor detection. Fructose transport is thought to be implicated. It is clearly established that facilitated fructose transport in tumor cells is related to the GLUT-5 transporter. This study therefore investigated whether [99mTc]GLA uptake is mediated by GLUT-5 transporter.Different tumor cell lines were used. Modulation of GLUT-5 expression was assessed with and without antisense oligonucleotides directed against GLUT-5. GLUT-5 expression was assessed by indirect cell ELISA. To correlate GLUT-5 expression with tracer accumulation, [99mTc]GLA uptake was determined after antisense treatment. A competition with fructose was also monitored.Inhibition of GLUT-5 expression by antisense oligonucleotides directed against GLUT-5 was effective after 24 h. An optimal of 10\u00a0\u03bcM antisense oligonucleotides directed against GLUT-5 produced a 30%\u201340% decrease in protein expression. Modulation of [99mTc]GLA uptake was monitored either by use of specific antisense oligonucleotides or by competition with fructose. Both of them produced a significant decrease of [99mTc]GLA accumulation in all tested cell lines.Our results clearly demonstrate that [99mTc]GLA uptake is related to GLUT-5 transporter expression and transport. In tumor imaging, [99mTc]GLA may be a useful tool for non-invasive detection of malignant tumors expressing high levels of GLUT-5 transporter as, for example, breast cancers.",

However, significant uptake and slow clearance from liver imposed severe limitations towards advocating its possible practical utility. In an attempt to improving its liver clearance, an ether linkage, which is known to help in liver clearance, was introduced in the molecule.The 2-nitroimidazole iminodiacetic acid (IDA) derivative containing an ether linkage was synthesized in a five step procedure from 2-nitroimidazole. This derivative was radiolabeled using [99mTc(CO)3(H2O)3]+ precursor complex. The corresponding Re(CO)3 analogue was also synthesized in the macroscopic level for structural characterization. The 99mTc(CO)3 complex was evaluated in an animal model bearing fibrosarcoma tumor.The in vivo evaluation of the complex indicated that, as envisaged, introduction of the ether linkage has improved clearance from the liver. The complex also showed higher retention in tumor compared to the 2-nitroimidazole-IDA-99mTc(CO)3 complex reported earlier. Though the tumor to muscle ratio improved with time, the tumor to blood ratio did not show any significant improvement. Despite improved liver clearance, there was significant liver activity present even at 3\u00a0h p.i. attributable to gradual accumulation of activity cleared from muscle and blood.Though the introduction of ether linkage improved liver clearance of the modified 2-nitroimidazole complex, it was found that a single ether linkage was not sufficient to achieve the desirable level of clearance. Probably, a linker with multiple ether groups, such as a di- or tri-ethylene glycol spacer, may be a possible solution to this issue.",

The uptake rates of 131I-FIAU by the Ad5-SIV-infected cells were significantly higher than by the Ad5-EGFP-infected cells for all time points (t\u00a0=\u00a018.43-54.83, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Moreover, the rate of VEGF165 protein secretion was highly correlated with the uptake rate of 131I-FIAU (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.84, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The radioactivity on the micro-PET/CT images was significantly higher in the left foreleg (which received the transfected MSCs) compared with the control foreleg.These results suggest that radionuclide reporter gene imaging may be used to monitor gene expression in vivo.",

This study compared the ability of sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) imaging to monitor the effectiveness of treatments to enhance early stem cell survival.Human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) transduced with an adenoviral vector to express both NIS and EGFP were mixed with culture media (control), matrigel (matrigel group) or pro-survival cocktail (PSC group), and 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 cells were injected into thigh muscles of C57BL/6 mice. Animals underwent serial optical imaging and 99mTcO4- scintigraphy. Image-based EGFP fluorescence and 99mTcO4- uptake was measured by region-of-interest analysis, and extracted tissues were measured for 99mTc activity. Fluorescent intensity measured from homogenized muscle tissue was used as reference for actual amount of viable ADSCs.ADSCs were efficiently transduced to express EGFP and NIS without affecting proliferative capacity. The absence of significant apoptosis was confirmed by annexin V FACS analysis and Western blots for activated caspase-3. Both fluorescence optical imaging and 99mTcO4- scintigraphy visualized implanted cells in living mice for up to 5\u00a0days. However, optical imaging displayed large variations in fluorescence intensity, and thus failed to detect difference in cell survival between groups or its change over time. In comparison, 99mTcO4- scintigraphy provided more reliable assessment of within-in group donor cell content as well as its temporal change. As a result, NIS imaging was able to discern beneficial effects of matrigel and pro-survival cocktail treatment on early ADSC survival, and provided quantitative measurements that correlated to actual donor cell content within implanted tissue.NIS reporter imaging may be useful for noninvasively assessing the efficacies of strategies designed to improve early survival of transplanted stem cells.",

TSHR is a key molecule regulating thyrocyte proliferation and function. This study aimed to test the therapeutic potential of TSHR in dedifferentiated DTC by gene transfection in order to restore cell differentiation and radioiodine uptake.Dedifferentiated FTC-133 (dFTC-133) cells were obtained by monoclonal culture of FTC-133 cell line after 131I radiation. Recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1-hTSHR was transfected into dFTC-133 cells by using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Immunofluorescence analysis was carried out to confirm TSHR expression and its location. Radioiodine uptake assay was thereafter investigated. mRNAs and proteins of TSHR and other thyroid differentiated markers were detected by real-time PCR and western blot respectively.Among the thyroid specific genes in dFTC-133 cells with stable low radioiodine uptake, TSHR was down-regulated most significantly compared with FTC-133. Then, after TSHR gene transfection, augmented expression of TSHR was observed in dFTC-133 cell surface and cytoplasm by immunofluorescence analysis. It was found that 125I uptake was 2.9 times higher (t\u00a0=\u00a028.63, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) in cells with TSHR transfection than control.

We investigated varicella zoster virus thymidine kinase (VZV-tk) as new PRG with radiolabeled bicyclic nucleoside analogues (BCNAs) as PET tracers.The uptake and washout of four different radiolabeled BCNAs was evaluated in cells expressing VZV-tk after lentiviral vector (LV) transduction and in control cells. Metabolism of the tracers was assayed by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Mice bearing VZV-TK expressing xenografts were imaged with PET.High uptake in VZV-tk expressing cells was seen for 3 of the 4 tracers tested. The uptake of the tracers could be blocked by the presence of excess thymidine in the incubation solution. Cellular retention was variable, with one tracer showing an acceptable half-life of ~\u00a01 hour. The amount of intracellular tracer correlated with the titer of LV used to transduce the cells. VZV-TK dependent conversion into metabolites was shown by HPLC. No specific accumulation was observed in cells expressing a fusion protein containing an HSV1-TK moiety. VZV-tk expression in xenografts resulted in a 60% increase in uptake in vivo as measured with PET.We have validated the combination of VZV-tk and radiolabeled BCNAs as new PRG/PRP system. Further optimization of the PRPs and the PRG are warranted to increase the signal.",

ALA's effect on NIS gene promoter was evaluated, and functional NIS expression was assessed by iodide uptake assay.Treatment with ALA increased NIS mRNA expression up to ten folds of control dose-dependently after 24 h of exposure. ALA increased NIS promoter activity, and increased iodide uptake by 1.6 fold. ALA induced expression of NIS protein, but had no significant effect on the plasma membrane trafficking. ALA increased phosphorylation of CREB and nuclear translocation of pCREB, and co-treatment of ALA and trichostatin A increased iodide uptake by three folds in TPC-1 cells.ALA is a potential agent to increase NIS transcription in TPC-1. It could be used as an adjunctive agent to increase efficacy of radioiodine therapy if combined with a strategy to increase NIS protein trafficking to cell membrane.",

     "publication date": "11-2012",
     "abstract": "The commercial viability of cyclotron-produced 99mTc as an alternative to generator-produced 99mTc depends on several factors. These include: production yield, ease of target processing and recycling of 100Mo, radiochemical purity, specific activity as well as the presence of other radionuclides, particularly various Tc radioisotopes that cannot be separated chemically and will remain in the final clinical preparation. These Tc radionuclidic impurities are derived from nuclear interactions of the accelerated protons with other stable Mo isotopes present in the enriched 100Mo target. The aim of our study was to determine experimentally the yields of Tc radioisotopes produced from these stable Mo isotopes as a function of incident beam energy in order to predict radionuclidic purity of 99mTc produced in highly enriched 100Mo targets of known isotopic composition.Enriched molybdenum targets of 95Mo, 96Mo, 97Mo, 98Mo and 100Mo were prepared by pressing powdered metal into an aluminum target support. The thick targets were bombarded with 10 to 24\u00a0MeV protons using the external beam line of the U-120\u00a0M cyclotron of the Nuclear Physics Institute, \u0158e\u017e. The thick target yields of 94Tc, 94mTc, 95Tc, 95mTc, 96m\u00a0+\u00a0gTc and 97mTc were derived from their activities measured by \u03b3 spectrometry using a high purity Ge detector. These data were then used to assess the effect of isotopic composition of highly enriched 100Mo targets on the radionuclidic purity of 99mTc as a function of proton beam energy. Estimates were validated by comparison to measured activities of Tc radioisotopes in proton irradiated, highly enriched 100Mo targets of known isotopic composition.The measured thick target yields of 94Tc, 94mTc, 95Tc, 95mTc, 96m\u00a0+\u00a0gTc and 97mTc correspond well with recently published values calculated via the EMPIRE-3 code. However, the measured yields are more favourable with regard to achievable radionuclidic purity of 99mTc. Reliability of the measured thick target yields was demonstrated by comparison of the estimated and measured activities of 94Tc, 95Tc, 95mTc, and 96m\u00a0+\u00a0gTc in highly enriched 100Mo (99%) targets that showed good agreement, with maximum differences within estimated uncertainties. Radioisotopes 94mTc and 97mTc were not detected in the irradiated 100Mo targets due to their low activities and measurement conditions; on the other hand we detected small amounts of the short-lived positron emitter 93Tc (T\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a02.75\u00a0h). In addition to 99mTc and trace amounts of the various Tc isotopes, significant activities of 96Nb, 97Nb and 99Mo were detected in the irradiated 100Mo targets.Radioisotope formation during the proton irradiation of Mo targets prepared from different, enriched stable Mo isotopes provides a useful data base to predict the presence of Tc radionuclidic impurities in 99mTc derived from proton irradiated 100Mo targets of known isotopic composition. The longer-lived Tc isotopes including 94Tc (T\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a04.883\u00a0h), 95Tc (T\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a020.0\u00a0h), 95mTc (T\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a061 d), 96m\u00a0+\u00a0gTc (T\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a04.24 d) and 97mTc (T\u00bd\u00a0=\u00a090 d) are of particular concern since they may affect the dosimetry in clinical applications. Our data demonstrate that cyclotron production of 99mTc, using highly enriched 100Mo targets and 19\u201324\u00a0MeV incident proton energy, will result in a product of acceptable radionuclidic purity for applications in nuclear medicine.",

These two methods, both based on radiolabeled ligand\u2013receptor binding, were compared with the data on receptor expression found using quantified western blotting.Four cell lines with different expressions of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) were chosen for the experiment: A431, HaCaT, HCT116 and HepG2.

The classic manual technique based on the saturation of cell receptors was performed on cells seeded in 24-well plates. The KEX method uses the LigandTracer, a special instrument which detects ligand retention in real time from seeded cells onto a rotating Petri dish. The western blot analysis was performed according to the routinely used procedure.A very close accordance between the manual saturation technique and the KEX method was found in all four cell lines used. The NRPC in the cell lines follows the same order using both ligands: A431\u00a0>\u00a0HaCaT\u00a0>\u00a0HCT116\u2248HepG2. Similarly, consistent data on EGFR expression in the studied cell lines were obtained using western blot analysis and the radiolabeled ligand binding assays.The KEX method could be as similarly useful for determining receptor expression as is the classic saturation method and western blotting.",

To shorten the preparation of 18F-AV-133 and to make it more widely available, we evaluated a simple, rapid purification with a solid-phase extraction method (SPE) using an Oasis HLB cartridge instead of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). The SPE method produced doses containing a pseudo-carrier, 9-hydroxypropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (AV-149).To test the possible side effects of this pseudo-carrier, comparative dynamic PET scans of the brains of normal monkeys (2 each) and uni-laterally 6-OH-dopamine-lesioned PD monkeys (2 each) were performed using 18F-AV-133 doses prepared by either SPE (containing pseudo-carrier) or HPLC (containing no pseudo-carrier). Autoradiographs of post mortem monkey brain sections were evaluated to confirm the relative 18F-AV-133 uptake in the PD monkey brains and the effects of the pseudo-carrier on VMAT2 binding.The radiochemical purity of the 18F-AV-133, whether prepared by SPE or by HPLC, was excellent (>\u00a099%). PET scans of normal and PD monkey brains showed an expected reduction of VMAT2 in the lesioned areas of the striatum. It was not affected by the presence of the pseudo-carrier, AV-149 (maximally 250\u00a0\u03bcg/dose). The reduced uptake in the striatum of the lesioned monkey brains was confirmed by autoradiography. Ex vivo inhibition studies of 18F-AV-133 binding in rat brains, conducted with increasing amounts of AV-149, suggested that at the highest concentration (3.5\u00a0mg/kg) the VMAT2 binding in the striatum was only moderately blocked (20% reduction).The pseudo-carrier, AV-149, did not affect the 18F-AV-133/PET imaging of VMAT2 binding sites in normal or uni-laterally lesioned monkey brains. The new streamlined SPE purification method will enable 18F-AV-133 to be widely available for routine clinical application in determining changes in monoamine neurons for patient with movement disorders or other psychiatric illnesses.",

In vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated that L-[18F]FMA had relatively high uptake in liver and kidney. Tumor uptake was fast, reaching a maximum within 30\u00a0min. The tumor-to-muscle, tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-brain ratios at 60\u00a0min post injection were 2.2, 1.9 and 3.0, respectively. In PET imaging studies, tumors were visualized with L-[18F]FMA in both 9L rat and transgenic mouse.L-[18F]FMA showed promising properties as a PET imaging agent for up-regulated ASC transporter associated with tumor proliferation.",

The cells were treated or untreated with unlabeled mAb RM2 to block the haptoglobin-\u03b2 chains expressed on the surface of the prostate cancer cells. 125I-mAb RM2 was added into the cell culture media and cellular uptake of 125I-mAb RM2 was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 hours of incubation. For the in vivo biodistribution study, PC-3 cells were implanted in athymic male mice. The animals were injected intravenously with 125I-mAb RM2. At 24, 48 and 72 hours after tracer injection, the animals were sacrificed and the activity levels of blood and tissue samples were determined.The uptake of 125I-mAb RM2 in the PC-3 and LNCaP cells increased according to the incubation time, while the uptake of 125I-mAb RM2 in MCF-7 cells did not show any increase up to 6 hours. The increase of 125I-RM2 uptake was not observed when the PC-3 and LNCaP cells were pre-treated with unlabeled RM2. In the biodistribution studies, 125I-mAb RM2 showed marked uptake into the implanted PC-3 cells. In PC-3 tumor-bearing mice, the tumor muscle ratio of 125I-RM2 was increased for up to 72 hours in a time-dependent manner.125I-mAb RM2 showed excellent prostate cancer cell targeting in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, mAb RM2 seems to be a potential candidate for an immunoligand for prostate cancer imaging.",

The expression of hNIS regulated by let-7 in the fusion gene hNIS-RU was constructed; the let-7 primer (pri-let-7), which could specifically bind to RU and the mir-143 primer (pri-mir143) not binding with RU, was cloned. A549 cells were transfected with hNIS or hNIS-RU, and additional cells were cotransfected with hNIS-RU and different concentrations of pri-let-7 or pri-mir143.

The uptake of 131I in hNIS-RU transfected A549 cells decreased to approximately 70% compared to hNIS-transfected cells, since hNIS-RU expression was suppressed by intracellular let-7. After cotransfection with hNIS-RU and various concentrations of pri-let-7, 131I uptake gradually decreased with increasing pri-let-7, while 131I uptake remained roughly unchanged in the presence of hNIS-RU cotransfected with different amounts of pri-mir143. CLI was highly correlated with gamma camera imaging (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.9893) and radioactivity counting (0.9779).Based upon miRNA-regulated reporter genes which mediate the uptake of the radionuclide, both CLI and gamma camera imaging can noninvasively detect miRNA expression in cells, which may provide a new way for the visualization of miRNA expression.",

However, the high toxicity of \u03b1-emitting radionuclides often does not permit administration of high activities for fear of normal tissue toxicity. Accordingly, targeting procedures need to be optimized for improved tumor control and minimized normal tissue toxicity. To guide design of effective cocktails of \u03b1-emitting radiopharmaceuticals and chemotherapy drugs, approaches that can predict biological response of a cell population on a cell-by-cell basis are needed.Cells were concomitantly treated with the \u03b1-particle emitting radiochemical 210Po-citrate and daunomycin, or with 210Po-citrate and doxorubicin. The responses of the treated cell populations were measured with a colony forming assay. The nonuniform cellular incorporation of the radiochemical and drugs was determined simultaneously on a cell-by-cell basis using flow cytometry. Monte Carlo methods were used to simulate cell survival on the basis of individual cell incorporation of each cytotoxic agent and validated by direct comparison with the experimental clonogenic cell survival.Both daunomycin and doxorubicin enhanced the toxicity of the \u03b1-particles with a magnitude greater than expected based on single-agent toxicities. Cell survival obtained by Monte Carlo simulation was in good agreement with clonogenic cell survival for the combination treatments.Flow cytometry assisted Monte Carlo simulations can be used to predict toxicity of cocktails of \u03b1-emitting radiopharmaceuticals and chemotherapy drugs in a manner that takes into account the effects of nonuniform distributions of agents within cell populations.",

Human uPAR-positive CRC HT-29 cells were inoculated in Nude mice and treated with 177Lu-DOTA-AE105 once a visible tumor had formed. To evaluate the true effect of the targeted radiotherapy, two controls groups were included in this study, one receiving a 177Lu-labeled non-binding control peptide and one receiving vehicle. All animals were treated day 0 and 7. A parallel 18F-FLT PET/CT study was performed on day 0, 1, 3 and 6.

Toxicity was assessed by recording mouse weight and by H&E staining of kidneys in each treatment group.uPAR-positive HT-29 xenograft was clearly visualized by PET/CT imaging using 64Cu-DOTA-AE105. Subsequently, these xenograft transplants were locally irradiated using 177Lu-DOTA-AE105, where a significant effect on tumor size and the number of uPAR-positive cells in the tumor was found (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Evaluations of biodistribution and dosimetry revealed highest accumulation of radioactivity in kidneys and tumor tissue. 18F-FLT PET/CT imaging study revealed a significant correlation between 18F-FLT tumor uptake and efficacy of the radionuclide therapy. A histological examination of the kidneys from one animal in each treatment group did not reveal any gross abnormalities and the general performance of all treated animals also showed no indications of radioactivity-induced toxicity.These findings document for the first time the in vivo efficacy of an uPAR-targeted radionuclide therapeutic intervention on both tumor size and its content of uPAR expressing cells thus setting the stage for future translation into clinical use.",

Agents that target TS and shut down de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate increase the uptake and retention of FLT in vitro and in vivo because of a compensating increase in the salvage pathway. Increases in both thymidine kinase-1 (TK1) and the equilibrative nucleoside transporter hENT1 have been reported to underlie this effect. We examined whether the effects of one TS inhibitor, 5-fluorouracil (5FU), on FLT uptake require proliferating cells and whether the effects are limited to increasing TK1 activity.The effects of 5FU on FLT transport and metabolism, TK1 activity, and cell cycle progression were evaluated in the human tumor cell line, A549, maintained as either a proliferating or non-proliferating culture.There were dose-dependent increases in FLT uptake that peaked after a 10\u00a0\u03bcM 5FU exposure and then declined to baseline levels or below at higher doses in both proliferating and non-proliferating cultures. The dose-dependence for FLT uptake was mirrored by changes in TK1 activity. S phase fraction did not correlate with FLT uptake in proliferating cultures. Chemical inhibition of hENT1 reduced overall levels of FLT uptake but did not affect the low dose increase in FLT uptake.5FU only affects FLT uptake in proliferating A549 cells and increases in FLT uptake are directly related to increased TK1 activity. Our studies did not support a role for hENT1 in the increased uptake of FLT after exposure to 5FU. Our studies with A549 cells support the suggestion that FLT-PET could provide a measure of TS inhibition in vivo.",

     "abstract": "[18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ([18F]FDG-PET) is widely used to monitor response to therapy in the clinic and has, more recently, been proposed as an early marker of long term response. This relies on the assumption that a change in glucose consumption parallels a reduction in viability and long term growth potential. However, cells may utilise substrates other than glucose and as many therapeutics interfere with glucose metabolism directly, it is entirely plausible that a positive [18F]FDG-PET response may be unrelated to long term growth. Furthermore, changes in metabolism and proliferation may take place on different temporal scales, thus restricting the time window in which [18F]FDG-PET is predictive. The PI3K oncogenic signalling pathway is a master regulator of multiple cellular processes including glucose metabolism, proliferation and cell survival. Inhibition of PI3K has been shown to reduce [18F]FDG uptake in several tumour types but the relative influence of this pathway on glucose metabolism and proliferation is not fully established.We proposed to (i) assess the suitability of [18F]FDG as a tracer for measuring response to PI3K inhibition and (ii) determine the optimum imaging schedule, in vitro. We used multicellular tumour spheroids, an excellent 3D in vitro model of avascular tumours, to investigate the effects of the PI3K inhibitors, NVP-BKM120 and NVP-BEZ235, on [18F]FDG uptake and its relation to 3D growth.Spheroids were prepared from two cell lines with a constitutively active PI3K/Akt pathway, EMT6 (highly proliferative mouse mammary) and FaDu (moderately proliferate human nasopharyngeal). Treatment consisted of a 24\u00a0h exposure to either inhibitor, and growth was monitored over the following 7\u00a0days. To mimic potential imaging regimens with [18F]FDG-PET, average [18F]FDG uptake per viable cell was measured (a) directly following the 24\u00a0h exposure, (b) following an additional 24\u00a0h recovery period, or (c) following a 48\u00a0h exposure.Growth was restricted significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in a dose-dependent fashion in spheroids from both cell lines treated with either inhibitor. In the highly proliferative cell line EMT6, [18F]FDG uptake was significantly reduced at all concentrations of inhibitor. For the moderately proliferative cell line FaDu, [18F]FDG was affected in a dose-dependent fashion, but to lesser degree. To assess the predictivity of [18F]FDG uptake for long term growth restriction, Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for each imaging regimen. These indicated that the optimal imaging schedules differed between cell lines.This study suggests that [18F]FDG may be a suitable marker of response to PI3K inhibition in the cell lines that we have studied. Our data support the hypothesis that imaging schedules should be optimised on a tumour type-specific basis.",

Use of Oasis cartridges yielded a less complex mixture for purification. On average, 1140\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0200\u00a0MBq (30.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4\u00a0mCi) of [18F]EF5 were collected at EOS. Small animal PET imaging studies showed specific retention of [18F]EF5 in tumors, with tumor-to-muscle ratios of 2.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 at about160 min after injection.A simple procedure has been developed for the routine synthesis of [18F]EF5 in amounts and purity required for clinical studies. This new method avoids the need for TFA evaporation and also enables facile automation of the synthesis using commercially available radiosynthesis modules.",

     "abstract": "[18F]-FMAU is a PET tracer being evaluated for imaging cell proliferation. Current multi-step procedures of [18F]-FMAU synthesis are time-consuming, resulting in low radiochemical yield and inconvenient applications for the clinic. We have previously reported the use of Friedel-Crafts catalysts for an improved synthesis of [18F]-FMAU. In this study, we investigated the efficiency of microwave-assisted radiosynthesis of [18F]-FMAU in comparison with conventional thermal conditions.A simplified one-pot synthesis of [18F]-FMAU was developed under microwave conditions. Various reaction times, temperatures, and microwave powers were systematically explored to optimize the coupling reaction of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-1,3,5-tri-O-benzoyl-d-arabinofuranose ([18F]-sugar) and bis-2,4-(trimethylsilyloxy)-5-methyluracil (silylated uracil) in the presence of a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate (TMSOTf).Microwave significantly enhanced the coupling efficiency of [18F]-sugar and silylated uracil by reducing the reaction time to 10\u00a0min (6-fold reduction as compared to conventional heating) at 95\u00a0\u00b0C. Base hydrolysis followed by high-performance liquid chromatography purification produced the desired [18F]-FMAU. The overall radiochemical yield was 20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04% (decay corrected, n\u00a0=\u00a03). Radiochemical purity was >\u00a099% and specific activity was >\u00a0400 mCi/\u03bcmol. The \u03b1/\u03b2 anomer ratio was 1:2. The radiosynthesis time was about 90\u00a0min from the end of bombardment.A reliable microwave-assisted approach has been developed for routine synthesis of [18F]-FMAU. The new approach affords a simplified process with shorter synthesis time and higher radiochemical yield as compared to conventional heating. A fully automated microwave-assisted synthesis of [18F]-FMAU can be readily achieved under new reaction conditions.",

Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging is superior to gamma scintigraphy in terms of sensitivity, spatial resolution and accuracy of quantification. This study reported that 18\u00a0F-labeled macroaggregated albumin (18\u00a0F-MAA) is an ideal PET imaging surrogate for 99mTc-MAA.18\u00a0F-MAA was prepared from the commercial MAA kit via a one-step conjugation with N-succinimidyl 4-18\u00a0F-fluorobenzoate (18\u00a0F-SFB). The biodistribution study and microPET/microSPECT imaging were conducted in normal SD rats after intravenous injection of 18\u00a0F-MAA/99mTc-MAA. A comparison study of these two radiotracers was performed after co-injection via the intrahepatic arterial in a N1S1 hepatoma-bearing SD rat model.The optimal condition for 18\u00a0F-MAA preparation is coupling MAA (0.5\u00a0mg) with 18\u00a0F-SFB at 45\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min in a phosphate buffer of pH 8.5. 18\u00a0F-MAA was prepared in 60\u00a0min with high radiochemical yield (30%\u201335%) and high radiochemical purity (>\u00a095%). The in vivo distribution of 18\u00a0F-MAA after intravenous injection meets the specifications of MAA depicted in European Pharmacopeia. Our study demonstrated excellent correlation between 18\u00a0F-MAA and 99mTc-MAA in the regional distribution of tumor, liver and lungs (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.965, 0.886 and 0.991, respectively), and also in the tumor-to-liver and tumor-to-lungs ratio (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.965 and 0.987, respectively) in a N1S1 hepatoma-bearing SD rat model. The organ uptakes derived from animal PET/CT and SPECT/CT imaging after administration of these two tracers were in accordance with those obtained in the distribution studies.Starting from commercial MAA kit, an efficient preparation of 18\u00a0F-MAA was successfully established. Highly correlated, almost parallel, regional distribution of 18\u00a0F-MAA and 99mTc-MAA in both normal rats and hepatoma-bearing rats was observed. The findings, taken together, demonstrate that 18\u00a0F-MAA is an ideal surrogate for 99mTc-MAA for clinical PET applications.",

Binding affinity and specificity were determined by radioligand receptor binding assay. Three antagonists were used for competitive binding analysis. In addition, uptake of the complexes into SH-SY5Y nerve cells was evaluated.The radiochemical purity of 99mTc-labeled ligands was more than 95%. Analysis of brain regional uptake showed higher concentration in the frontal lobe and specific uptake in the hippocampus. 99mTc-NCAM reached a higher target to nontarget ratio than 99mTc-NHAM. The results indicated that 99mTc-NCAM bound to a single site on the NMDA receptor with a Kd of 701.21\u00a0nmol/l and a Bmax of 62.47\u00a0nmol/mg. Specific inhibitors of the NMDA receptor, ketamine and dizocilpine, but not the dopamine D2 and 5HT1A receptor partial agonist aripiprazole, inhibited specific binding of 99mTc-NCAM to the NMDA receptor. Cell physiology experiments showed that NCAM can increase the viability of SH-SY5Y cells after glutamate-induced injury.The new radioligand 99mTc-NCAM has good affinity for and specific binding to the NMDA receptor, and easily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier; suggesting that it might be a potentially useful tracer for NMDA receptor expression.",

The noninvasive detection of A\u03b2 plaques may increase the accuracy of clinical diagnosis as well as monitor therapeutic interventions. While [11C]-PiB is the most widely used A\u03b2 positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer, due to the short half-life of 11C (20\u00a0min), its application is limited to centers with an on-site cyclotron and 11C radiochemistry expertise. Therefore, novel [18F] (half-life 110\u00a0min)-labeled A\u03b2 PET tracers have been developed. We have demonstrated that [18F]-florbetaben-PET can differentiate individuals diagnosed with AD from healthy elderly, Parkinson's disease and frontotemporal lobe dementia (FTLD-tau) patients. While [18F]-florbetaben-PET retention matched the reported postmortem distribution of A\u03b2 plaques, the nature of [18F]-florbetaben binding to other pathological lesions comprising misfolded proteins needs further assessment. The objective of this study was to determine whether Florbetaben selectively binds to A\u03b2 plaques in postmortem tissue specimens containing mixed pathological hallmarks (i.e., tau and \u03b1-synuclein aggregates).Human AD, FTLD-tau and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) brain sections were analyzed by [18F]-florbetaben autoradiography and [3H]-florbetaben high-resolution emulsion autoradiography and [19F]-florbetaben fluorescence microscopy.Both autoradiographical analyses demonstrated that Florbetaben exclusively bound A\u03b2 plaques in AD brain sections at low nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, at concentrations thousand-folds higher than those during a PET scan, [19F]-florbetaben did not bind to \u03b1-synuclein or tau aggregates in DLB and FTLD-tau brain sections, respectively. Detection of [19F]-florbetaben staining by fluorescence microscopy in several AD brain regions demonstrated that Florbetaben identified A\u03b2 plaques in all brain regions examined.This study provides further evidence that [18F]-florbetaben-PET is a highly selective radiotracer to assess A\u03b2 plaque deposition in the brain.",

The radiochemical purity was >\u00a098% by analytical HPLC, and the specific activity was >\u00a05.92\u00a0TBq/\u03bcmol. The cellular uptake assay showed preferential uptake of [18F]FETMP in cardiomyocytes. The results of biodistribution and micro-PET imaging studies of [18F]FETMP in mice and rats showed preferential accumulation in the myocardium.The results suggest that [18F]FETMP would be a promising candidate for myocardial imaging and might be useful for clinical cardiac PET/CT applications.",

The aim of this study was to quantify late effects in renal cortex of nude mice exposed to high amounts of [177Lu]-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotate ([177Lu]-DOTATATE), and to determine whether a threshold dose value exists for these findings.Nude mice were exposed to 90, 120 or 150\u00a0MBq of [177Lu]-DOTATATE. Renal toxicity was evaluated up to 6 months after injection. Blood samples were collected to examine renal functional markers, and after sacrifice at 6 months changes in renal morphology were explored. Tissue damage was estimated by quantifying the relative area of the different subunits in the renal cortex using point counting. Additional morphological signs of radiation damage were also noted. The absorbed doses to the kidneys were estimated by previously determined kidney pharmacokinetics and Monte Carlo simulations for different assumptions regarding the activity distribution.Increased serum creatinine and urea values indicated long-term renal toxicity. The tissue area occupied by proximal tubules decreased with increasing doses of [177Lu]-DOTATATE, whereas the other subunits in cortex slightly increased. The mean absorbed dose in the renal cortex for [177Lu]-DOTATATE was estimated to be 35\u201358\u00a0Gy for the different groups of animals. A dose\u2013response relationship was observed for proximal tubular damage, and a threshold dose value of 24\u00a0Gy (BED 37\u00a0Gy) was determined.Selective morphological changes in kidney cortex of nude mice were quantified and appeared in a dose dependent manner after injection of high amounts of [177Lu]-DOTATATE.",

     "abstract": "99mTc-Sn-PYP (Technetium-99m labeled tin pyrophosphate) has been widely used as a radiopharmaceutical for bone scanning as well as in nuclear cardiology. It is also found in the body in trace amounts. 177Lu is presently considered as an excellent radionuclide for developing bone pain palliation agents. PYP is an analogue of MDP and MDP has been labeled with 177Lu. No study on preparing a complex of 177Lu with PYP has been reported yet. Based on these facts, it was hypothesized that a bone-seeking 177Lu-PYP (Lutetium-177 labeled Pyrophosphate) radiopharmaceutical could be developed as an agent for palliative radiotherapy of bone pain due to skeletal metastases.177Lu was produced by irradiating lutetium foil (11\u00a0mg) natural target at a flux \u223c\u00a01.0\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01014n/cm2/s for 12\u00a0h in the swimming pool type reactor. 177Lu in the form of 177LuCl3 was labeled with PYP. The radiochemical purity and labeling efficiencies were determined by paper chromatography. Labeling of 177Lu with PYP was optimized and a labeled sample was subjected to HPLC analysis. To determine the charge on the 177Lu-PYP complex, radio-electrophoresis was conducted for 1 h under a voltage of 300\u00a0V and 45\u00a0mA current using 0.025\u00a0M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). Bioevaluation studies with rabbit under \u03b3-camera were also performed to verify the skeletal uptake.The quality control using paper radio-chromatography has shown >\u00a099% radiochemical purity of 177Lu-PYP complex. Radio-chromatography also showed maximum labeling at ligand/metal ratio\u00a0=\u00a060:1. HPLC analysis showed 1.42\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0min retention time of 177Lu-PYP complex. No decrease in labeling was observed at higher temperatures. Gamma-camera images of 177Lu-PYP in normal rabbit at 24\u00a0h post injection also showed high skeletal uptake.The study demonstrated that sodium pyrophosphate could be labeled with 177Lu with high radiochemical yields (>\u00a099%). Negatively charged 177Lu-PYP complex retained stability for a day and at high temperatures too. Gamma-camera images of 177Lu-PYP in normal rabbit at 24\u00a0h post injection showed high skeletal uptake, suggesting that it may be useful as a bone-pain palliation agent for the treatment of bone metastases.",

A similar agent, 153Sm-labeled ethylenediaminetetramethylenephosphonic acid (153Sm-EDTMP), has been reported to exhibit dosage-limiting skeletal saturation.Sm-DOTMP was prepared with tracer activity of 153Sm and sufficient stable, unenriched Sm to simulate different activities. Cohorts of seven 280-g Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were administered the equivalent of 296, 592, 888, 1184 and 1480 MBq (8, 16, 24, 32 and 40 mCi) at a fixed chelant-to-metal ratio of 1.5:1 and euthanized 3 h after administration. Cohorts of three 128-g Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were administered equivalent dosages of 10.4, 592 and 888 (0.28, 16 and 32 mCi) at a fixed chelant-to-metal ratio of 270:1 and euthanized 2 h after administration. A simulated activity of 1480 MBq (40 mCi) at a chelant-to-metal ratio of 1.5:1 was administered to cohorts of seven rats that were euthanized at 2, 4, 24 or 48 h postadministration. The heart, lungs, liver, spleen, kidneys, small intestine, large intestine, urinary bladder, muscle and a femur were excised, weighed and counted. The data were analyzed to determine skeletal uptake and source organ residence times.No statistically significant skeletal saturation was observed up to human-equivalent dosages of 370 GBq (10 Ci) at a chelant-to-metal ratio of 1.5:1, but the skeletal uptake dropped by 40% over the range of dosages at a chelant-to-metal ratio of 270:1. At a chelant-to-metal ratio of 1.5:1, the preferred ratio, the skeletal uptake fraction in rats was 0.408 (95% confidence interval 0.396\u20130.419) with an effective half-life of 47.3 h (95% confidence interval 42.3\u201353.7; the physical half-life of 153Sm is 46.3 h). Extrapolating to an adult human model, 52.9 GBq (1.43 Ci) of 153Sm-DOTMP would deliver 40 Gy to the red marrow.153Sm-DOTMP has dosimetry equivalent to that of 153Sm-EDTMP at low dosages, yet with no skeletal saturation at higher administered activities.",

In this study, we present a direct comparison of the pharmacokinetic properties of this tracer with 68Ga-NODAGA-cyclo(RGDyK), in order to assess its potential as an alternative for 18F-Galacto-cyclo(RGDfK).68Ga labeling of NODAGA-cyclo(RGDyK) was done in full automation using HEPES-buffered eluate of an SnO2 based 68Ga-generator. Using M21 (human melanoma) xenografted BALB/c nude mice, biodistribution studies and micro-PET scans were performed for both 18F-Galacto-cyclo(RGDfK) and 68Ga-NODAGA-cyclo(RGDyK), and for the latter, in vivo stability was assessed. IC50 was determined in a displacement assay on M21 cells against 125I-echistatin.68Ga-NODAGA-cyclo(RGDyK) was produced with high specific activity (routinely ca. 500\u00a0GBq/\u03bcmol) within 15 min. IC50 values are similar for both substances. Tracer uptake was similar in \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 positive tumors (1.45%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11% ID/g and 1.35%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.53% ID/g for 68Ga-NODAGA-RGD and 18F-Galacto-RGD, respectively) as well as for all other organs and tissues, with the exception of gall bladder and intestines, where 18F-Galacto-cyclo(RGDfK) uptake was significantly higher, which can be explained by the higher hydrophilicity of 68Ga-NODAGA-cyclo(RGDyK) (logP\u00a0=\u00a0\u22124.0 vs. \u2212\u00a03.2 for 18F-Galacto-RGD). Only intact tracer was detected 30\u00a0min p.i. in organs and tumor; however, minor amounts of metabolites were found in the urine (6% of total urine activity).68Ga-labeling of NODAGA-RGD can be performed rapidly and efficiently within 15\u00a0min in a GMP compliant process. Similar preclinical results were obtained in comparison with 18F-Galacto-RGD. Therefore, 68Ga-NODAGA-cyclo(RGDyK) is a suitable replacement for 18F-Galacto-cyclo(RGDfK).",

Complex [67Ga(RGD-1)]+ was more stable (92% after 2 h) than [67Ga(RGD-2)]+ (73% after 2 h) in a transferrin challenge experiment. IC50 values for both conjugates (H2RGD-1 and H2RGD-2) and nonconjugated RGD were determined in a cell-based competitive binding assay with 125I-echistatin using U87MG cells, where enhanced specific binding was observed for the multivalent H2RGD-2 conjugate compared to the monovalent H2RGD-1 and nonconjugated cRGDyK. The U87MG cell line was also used to generate subcutaneous xenograft tumors on RAG2M mice, which were used to evaluate the in vivo properties of [68Ga(RGD-1)]+ and [68Ga(RGD-2)]+. After 2 h of dynamic imaging, both block and nonblock mice were sacrificed to collect select organs at the 2-h time point. Although the uptake is specific, as judged from the ratios of nonblock to block (2.36 with [67Ga(RGD-1)]+, 1.46 with [67Ga(RGD-2)]+), both conjugates display high uptake in blood.We have successfully synthesized and applied the first bifunctional versions of H2dedpa for conjugation to a targeting vector and subsequent imaging of the corresponding conjugates.",

     "abstract": "Among the many clinically relevant peptide receptor systems, bombesin (BN) receptors have attracted enormous attraction due to their overexpression in various frequently occurring human tumors including breast and prostate, thus making such receptors promising targets with radiolabeled BN analogs. The present study describes the preparation and evaluation of a series of new BN derivatives as potential tumor imaging agents.Several new BN derivatives with the common structure MAG3-X-BN(1\u201314 or 6\u201314), where X=Asp or Asp-Asp, were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis. S-benzoylmercaptoacetic acid was incorporated at the end of synthesis via manual conjugation to yield MAG3-BN conjugates. Radiolabeling with 99mTc was accomplished by ligand exchange method. The receptor-binding affinity assays were performed in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, T47-D and PC-3 cancer cell lines. In vivo biodistribution and clearance kinetics were assessed in Balb/c mice, and tumor targeting efficacy was determined in nude mice bearing breast tumor xenografts.The peptides were prepared conveniently and radiolabeled efficiently with 99mTc (up to 95% labeling efficiency). In vitro cell binding assays demonstrated high affinity (values in the nanomolar range) of 99mTc peptides towards breast and prostate cancer cell lines. In addition, the radioconjugates displayed significant internalization (values ranged between 19% and 35%) in tumor cells. In vivo biodistribution and biokinetics are characterized by efficient clearance from the blood and variable degrees of excretion through the renal pathway. In vivo tumor targeting studies displayed variable uptake capacity of different BN derivatives, underlining the influence of specific amino acid sequence on tumor targeting profiles. Tumor uptake was always higher than the radioactivity in the blood and muscle, with good tumor retention and good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios, indicating the potential of these agents for targeting tumors in vivo.The combination of favorable in vitro and in vivo properties may render these BN peptides as potential candidates for targeting BN/GRP receptor-positive tumors. They deserve further evaluation to determine their real strength. The present data indeed provide useful information regarding peptide structure\u2013pharmacologic activity relationship, which might be useful in designing and developing new BN-like peptides for efficient targeting of tumors in vivo.",

Cyanine dye 5.5 (Cy5.5) was conjugated with EGBP-GGG-SC, EGBP-AOC-SC, and EGBP-AM2BA-SC. Cellular binding study of EGBP-Linker-Cy5.5 conjugates or 125I-EGBP-Linker compounds was performed in U87MG cells. Optical imaging studies were performed in U87MG bearing mice. Three of seven clones from the 12-mer peptide library showed a specific binding affinity to rhEGFR, and they encoded the same 12 amino acid peptide sequence, FPMFNHWEQWPP. Confocal images show that the fluorescent signal of EGBP-Linker-Cy5.5 conjugates was decreased in the order: EGBP-AOC-Cy5.5\u226bEGBP-AM2BA-Cy5.5>EGBP-GGG-Cy5.5. EGBP-AOC-Cy5.5 appeared in cell cytoplasm and surface, and it was inhibited by free EGBP apparently.

A compartment model was developed to quantify the uptake kinetics of 99mTc-Duramycin in normal and ischemic myocardial tissue.99mTc-duramycin binds avidly to the damaged tissue with a high target-to-background radio. Compartment modeling shows that accessibility of binding sites in myocardial tissue to 99mTc-Duramycin is not a limiting factor and the rate constant of target binding in the target tissue is at 2.2\u00a0ml/nmol/min/g. The number of available binding sites for 99mTc-Duramycin in ischemic myocardium was estimated at 0.14\u00a0nmol/g. Covalent modification of D15 resulted in a 9-fold reduction in binding affinity.99mTc-Duramycin accumulates avidly in target tissues in a PE-dependent fashion. Model results reflect an efficient uptake mechanism, consistent with the low molecular weight of the radiopharmaceutical and the relatively high density of available binding sites.

Data obtained were then analyzed to determine the changes of specific binding ratio.Chronic MK-801 treatment for a month caused significantly increased local motor activity and induced an inhibition of social interaction. As shown in [123I]epidepride ex vivo autoradiographs, MK-801 induced a decrease of specific binding ratio in the striatum (24.01%), hypothalamus (35.43%), midbrain (41.73%) and substantia nigra (37.93%). In addition, [123I]epidepride small animal SPECT/CT neuroimaging was performed in the striatum and midbrain. There were statistically significant decreases in specific binding ratio in both the striatum (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and midbrain (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) between the saline and MK-801 group.These results suggest that [123I]epidepride is a useful radio-tracer to reveal the alterations of dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding in a rat schizophrenia model and is also helpful to evaluate therapeutic effects of schizophrenia in the future.",

Furthermore, preclinical studies have established the \u201cproof-of-principle\u201d of uPA-targeting by PAI-2-cytotoxin conjugates in human carcinoma models. However, these studies also suggest that PAI-2 is rapidly cleared via the renal system with low total dose reaching the tumour. In this study, a comparative single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and biodistribution (BD) analysis of different forms of PAI-2 labelled with the radioisotopes iodine-123 (123I) and technetium-99m (99mTc) was undertaken.The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and BD of wild-type, \u0394CD-loop and PEGylated \u0394CD-loop PAI-2 labelled with the commonly used diagnostic SPECT radioisotopes 99mTc or 123I were compared in mouse models of human prostate carcinoma.

Preliminary studies with a short branched-chain PEGylated 123I-Bn-PAI-2 \u0394CD-loop indicated an increase in blood retention time and tumour uptake. All 123I-Bn-labelled radiotracers were largely excreted through the kidneys. By comparison, both wild-type 123I-PAI-2 (labelled directly via tyrosine residues) and 99mTc-PAI-2 displayed different PK/BD patterns compared to 123I-Bn-PAI-2, suggesting greater liver based catabolism and thus slower elimination. SPECT imaging mimicked the BD results of all radiotracers.The different labelling methods gave distinct PAI-2 BD and tumour uptake profiles, with radioiodination resulting in the best non-tumour organ clearance profiles.

Pre-treatment microPET images were acquired on SKOV-3 cell-implanted nude mice after injection with 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121. KR-31831 (50 mg/kg) was then injected intraperitoneally into the treatment group (n=3), while injection vehicle was injected into the control (n=4) and blocking (n=3) groups. After injections occurred daily for 28 days, all groups of mice underwent post-treatment microPET imaging after injection with 64Cu-DOTA-VEGF121. The post-treatment images showed high tumor uptake in the control group and reduced tumor uptake in both the blocking and treatment groups.

PET imaging with [11C]telmisartan is expected to provide information about the whole body pharmacokinetics of telmisartan as well as its transport property by OATP1B3. The purpose of the study was to determine the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of [11C]telmisartan in humans.Biodistribution of [11C]telmisartan was measured in three rats and six healthy male human volunteers. In the rat study, a dynamic emission scan was performed for 90 min. In the human study, dynamic whole-body PET images were acquired after intravenous injection of [11C]telmisartan. ROIs were defined for source organs on the PET images to measure time-course of [11C]telmisartan uptake as percentage injected dose and the number of disintegration for each organ. Radiation dosimetry was calculated with OLINDA/EXM.In the rat study, most radioactivity was rapidly taken up by the liver and part of it was excreted into the biliary tract and intestine. Extrapolating from the rat data, the effective dose for the adult human being was estimated to be 3.65\u00b10.01 microSv/MBq (n=3). In the human study, most of the tracer was taken up by the liver as well, although not as rapidly as in the rat. The activity in the gall bladder and intestine increased gradually. The effective dose for the adult human being was 4.24\u00b10.09 microSv/MBq (n=6).[11C]Telmisartan is a safe PET tracer with a dosimetry profile comparable to other common 11C PET tracers.",

However, [18F]FEAnGA exhibited rapid renal clearance, which resulted in a relatively low tracer uptake in the tumor. To improve the pharmacokinetics of [18F]FEAnGA, we developed its more lipophilic methyl ester analog, [18F]FEAnGA-Me.[18F]FEAnGA-Me was obtained by alkylation of the O-protected glucuronide methyl ester precursor with [18F]-fluoroethylamine ([18F]FEA), followed by removal of the acetate protecting groups with NaOMe/MeOH. The PET tracer was evaluated by in vitro and in vivo studies.[18F]FEAnGA-Me was obtained in 5%\u201310% overall radiochemical yield. It is 10-fold less hydrophilic than [18F]FEAnGA and it is stable in PBS and in the presence of \u03b2-GUS for 1\u00a0h. However, in the presence of esterase or plasma [18F]FEAnGA-Me is converted to [18F]FEAnGA, and subsequently converted to [18F]FEA by \u03b2-GUS. MicroPET studies in Wistar rats bearing a C6 glioma and a sterile inflammation showed similar uptake in tumors after injection of either [18F]FEAnGA-Me or [18F]FEAnGA. Both tracers had a rapid two-phase clearance of total plasma radioactivity with a half-life of 1 and 8\u00a0min. The [18F]FEAnGA fraction generated from [18F]FEAnGA-Me by in vivo hydrolysis had a circulation half-life of 1 and 11\u00a0min in plasma. Similar distribution volume in the viable part of the tumor was found after injection of either [18F]FEAnGA-Me or [18F]FEAnGA.The imaging properties of [18F]FEAnGA-Me were not significantly better than those of [18F]FEAnGA.

Due to the clinical importance of [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]-FDG) and its availability in almost every positron-emission tomography center, new radiofluorinated [18F]-FDG-folate and methotrexate conjugates ([18F]-5 and [18F]-8) were synthesized using [18F]-FDG as a prosthetic group. In a convenient and simple one-step radiosynthesis, [18F]-5 and [18F]-8 conjugates were prepared in high radiochemical yields (>\u00a080%) with total synthesis time of almost 20\u00a0min, and radiochemical purities were found to be greater than 98% without high-performance liquid chromatography purification, which make these approaches amenable for automation. In vitro tests on KB cell line showed that a significant amount of the radioconjugates were associated with the cell fractions. In vivo characterization in normal Balb/c mice revealed rapid blood clearance of these radioconjugates with excretion predominantly by the urinary and hepatobiliary systems for [18F]-5 and [18F]-8 conjugates, respectively. Biodistribution studies in nude mice-bearing human KB cell line xenografts demonstrated significant tumor uptake and favorable kinetics profile for [18F]-5 over the other conjugate. The uptake in the tumors was blocked by the excess coinjection of cold folic acid, suggesting the receptor-mediated process. These results demonstrate that [18F]-5 may be useful as a molecular probe for detecting and staging of folate receptor-positive cancers, such as ovarian cancer and their metastasis, as well as monitoring tumor response to the treatment.",

However, the slow kinetics of [18F]FMISO require a 2-h delay between tracer administration and patient scanning. Labelled chloroethyl sulfoxides have shown faster kinetics and higher contrast than [18F]FMISO in a rat model of ischemic stroke. However, these nitrogen mustard analogues are unsuitable for routine production and use in humans. Here we report on the synthesis and in vitro and in vivo evaluation of two novel sulfoxides which we synthesised from a single precursor molecule via either 2-[18F]fluoroethyl azide click chemistry or conventional nucleophilic displacement of a chloride leaving group. The yields of the click chemistry approach were 90\u00b15% of [18F]2 based on 2-[18F]fluoroethyl azide, and the yields for the SN reaction were 15\u00b15% of [18F]1 based on K[18F]F. Both radiotracers underwent metabolism in an in vitro assay using S9 liver fractions with biological half-lives of 32.39 and 43.32 min, respectively. Imaging studies using an SK-RC-52 tumor model in BALB/c nude mice have revealed that only [18F]1 is retained in hypoxic tumors, whereas [18F]2 is cleared from those tumors at a rate similar to that of muscle tissue. [18F]1 has emerged as a promising new lead structure for further development of sulfoxide-based hypoxia imaging agents. In particular, the mechanism of uptake needs to be elucidated and changes to the chemical structure need to be made in order to reduce metabolism and improve radiotracer kinetics.",

In general, 11C-5-HTP-PET is more sensitive in the visualization of NETs, but no studies have investigated its role after RFA.Six consecutive patients with liver metastases from NETs were subjected to RFA treatment. All patients underwent baseline imaging before RFA and on two occasions (1\u20132 and 6\u201311 months) after RFA. The imaging consisted of 11C-5-HTP-PET, CEUS and CECT on all three occasions.Thirty RFA areas were evaluated, and residual tumors (RTs) were depicted in eight areas (22%). 11C-5-HTP-PET depicted RTs after RFA with maximum sensitivity (100%) and specificity (100%), using radiological follow-up as the gold standard. 11C-5-HTP-PET detected five out of eight RTs earlier than CECT or CEUS. In general, the sensitivity of 11C-5-HTP-PET exceeded that of CECT and CEUS for early visualization of NET liver metastases.11C-5-HTP-PET can be used in the follow-up after RFA for the purpose of detecting RT, and it provides additional information to CEUS and CECT by detecting new lesions.",

It has been demonstrated that BN analogues can be radiolabeled for potential diagnosis and treatment of GRPR-expressing malignancies. Previous studies have conjugated various chelators to the eight C-terminal amino acids of BN [BN(7-14)] for radiolabeling with 64Cu. Recently, (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid) (NOTA) has been evaluated as the five-coordinate 64Cu complex, with results indicating GRPR-specific tumor uptake. This study aimed to conjugate S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-NOTA (p-SCN-Bn-NOTA) to BN(7-14) such that it could form a six-coordinate complex with 64Cu and to evaluate the resulting peptide.p-SCN-NOTA was conjugated to 8-aminooctanoic acid (Aoc)-BN(7-14) in solution to yield NOTA-Bn-SCN-Aoc-BN(7-14). The unlabeled peptide was evaluated in a cell binding assay using PC-3 prostate cancer cells and 125I-Tyr4-BN to determine the IC50 value. The peptide was radiolabeled with 64Cu and evaluated for internalization into PC-3 cells and for tumor uptake in mice bearing PC-3 xenografts using biodistribution and micro-positron emission tomography imaging studies.The binding assay demonstrated that NOTA-Bn-SCN-Aoc-BN(7-14) bound with high affinity to GRPR with an IC50 of 1.4 nM. The radiolabeled peptide demonstrated time-dependent internalization into PC-3 cells. In vivo, the peptide demonstrated tumor-specific uptake and imaging that were comparable to those of previously reported 64Cu-labeled BN analogues.These studies demonstrate that 64Cu-NOTA-Bn-SCN-Aoc-BN(7-14) binds to GRPR-expressing cells and that it can be used for imaging of GRPR-expressing prostate cancer.",

At different time points after injection, whole body distribution of radionuclides was imaged using a gamma camera. Distribution of radionuclides in selected organs was determined via \u03b3-counting after sacrifice. Biological half-lives of the conjugates were calculated from whole body activities.After i.p. injection 213Bi-Fab rapidly accumulated in the kidneys indicative of glomerular filtration and reabsorption. Accumulation of 213Bi-IgG in the kidneys was significantly lower. 213Bi-IgM showed a striking accumulation in the liver 180 min after i.p. injection. 111In-IgG persisted in the circulation up to 72 h both after i.p. and i.v. injection. 111In-IgM showed a continuous accumulation in the liver. Moreover, 111In-IgM was significantly higher 24 h after i.v. injection than i.p. injection both in liver and spleen. These differences could be confirmed via scintigraphy. After injection of 111In-IgG differences in scintigraphic images between i.v. and i.p. were clearly visible only at 3 h. Biological half lives were 24 h, 45 h and 165 h for 111In-IgM, 111In-Fab and 111In-IgG, respectively.Retention of radioimmunoconjugates in the peritoneal cavity positively correlates with the molecular mass of the antibody.

The binding of the radioligands was assessed in vitro using autoradiography on cryosections of Rhesus monkey brains and in vivo/ex vivo using organ distribution studies in rats.The tracer production method was improved in terms of higher robustness, simplification and good manufacturing practice (GMP) relevance. The synthesis variation did not influence the biological performance of the tracers. There was no statistically significant difference observed in the binding of [67/68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC and [67/68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE either in brain cortex in vitro or in rat biodistribution and uptake in SSTR-positive tissues such as pancreas, adrenals and pituitary. The uptake in these organs was precluded by the excess of octreotide (Sandostatin). The 10-fold higher affinity to SSTR2 of DOTA-TATE as compared to DOTA-TOC known from studies in transfected cells was reflected in a slightly more intense binding of [67/68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE than of [67/68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC in the monkey brain sections in vitro, but not in vivo in the rat.A robust 68Ga-labeling method was introduced. The difference in the uptake of [67/68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TOC and [67/68Ga]Ga-DOTA-TATE in SSTR2-positive organs was not statistically significant either in vitro in tissue studies or in vivo/ex vivo in rat experiments.

While interobserver variability has been found to be lower for a maximum standard uptake value (SUV)max than for an averaged SUV (SUVmean), the repeatability has not been investigated yet. In this study, we determined the repeatability of SUV values in two sequential measurements 5 min apart.Positron emission tomography data of malignant chest tumors were acquired dynamically during 45 min in 20 patients. SUV values were derived from the hottest (SUVmax), the mean of the 5 (SUV5) and 10 (SUV10) hottest voxels and the mean of a volume of interest (SUVmean). The repeatability of the SUV measurements was determined as the standard deviation of the difference between the values at 40 and 45 min and represented as Bland\u2013Altman graphs.The standard deviation of the difference between the two sequential scans for SUVmax, SUV5, SUV10 and SUVmean was 1.01, 0.53, 0.37 and 0.28.The repeatability of SUV is markedly increased by deriving the value from multiple voxels. Compared to SUVmax, the variability in SUV measurements is reduced by a factor of 2.7 (2.7=1.01/0.37) if 10 voxels are pooled.",

The accumulation of 99mTc-methoxyisobutylisonitrile ([99mTc]MIBI) in vitro was measured. In vivo imaging of severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice implanted with Bcap37 and Bcap37/MDR1 cells was performed by scintigraphy and micro-positron emission tomography (PET).The uptake of [99mTc]MIBI was 0.62%\u00b10.05% in the Bcap37/MDR1 cells and 2.02%\u00b10.28% in the Bcap37 cells.

With the aim to develop new potential 99mTc-radiopharmaceuticals for imaging hypoxia, we have synthesized two novel isocyanide derivatives of metronidazole, which has demonstrated high affinity for hypoxic tumors in vitro and in vivo.Metronidazole derivatives 4-isocyano-N-[2-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl]butanamide (M1) and 1-(4-isocyanobutanoyl)-4-[2-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl]piperazine (M2) were synthesized, and labeling was performed through preparation of their corresponding 99mTc-(4+1) complexes, 99mTc-NS3M1 and 99mTc-NS3M2. The structure of the technetium complexes was corroborated by preparation and characterization of the corresponding rhenium complexes. We have studied the main physicochemical properties (stability, lipophilicity and plasma protein binding). Biological behavior in HCT-15 cells both in oxia and in hypoxia was assessed. Biodistribution in normal mice and in animals bearing induced 3LL Lewis murine lung carcinoma was also studied.Metronidazole derivatives were successfully synthesized. Labeling with high radiochemical purity was achieved for both ligands. 99mTc complexes were stable in labeling milieu and human plasma. However, presence of the piperazine linker in M2 resulted in higher lipophilicity and protein binding. Although cell uptake in hypoxic conditions was observed for both radiotracers, 99mTc-NS3M2 biodistribution was considered unsuitable for a potential radiopharmaceutical due to high liver uptake and poor blood clearance. However, 99mTc-NS3M1 demonstrated a very favorable in vivo profile both in normal mice and in mice bearing induced tumors.Selective uptake and retention in tumor together with favorable tumor/muscle ratio make 99mTc-NS3M1 a promising candidate for further evaluation as potential hypoxia imaging agent in tumors.",

It has application in molecular imaging and blood clotting particularly for monitoring antiapoptotic drug treatments. We are investigating a fluorine-18-radiolabeled analog of this compound for positron emission tomography studies.We prepared the tosylate precursor methyl 2-(5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-(tosyloxymethyl)butanoate (4) to synthesize fluorine-18-labeled NST732. Fluorination reaction of the tosylate precursor in 1:1 acetonitrile:dimethylsulfoxide with tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride proceeds through an aziridine intermediate (4A) to afford two regioisomers: 2-(5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-fluorobutanoate (5) and methyl 2-(5-(dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonamido)-2-(fluoromethyl)butanoate (6). Acid hydrolysis of the fluoromethylbutanoate (6) isomer produced NST732. As the fluorination reaction of the tosylate precursor proceeds through an aziridine intermediate (4A) and the fluorination conceivably could be done directly on the aziridine, we have separately prepared an aziridine precursor (4A). Fluorine-18 labeling of the aziridine precursor (4A) was performed with [18F]tetrabutyl ammonium fluoride to afford the same two regioisomers (5 and 6). The [18F]2-((5-dimethylamino)naphthalene-1-sulfonamido)methyl)-2-fluorobutanoic acid (NST732) was then obtained by the hydrolysis of corresponding [18F]-labeled ester (6) with 6 N hydrochloric acid.Two regioisomers obtained from the fluorination reaction of aziridine were easily separated by high-performance liquid chromatography. The total radiochemical yield was 15%\u00b13% (uncorrected, n=18) from the aziridine precursor in a 70-min synthesis time with a radiochemical purity >99%.Fluorine-18-labeled ApoSense compound [18F]NST732 is prepared in moderate yield by direct fluorination of an aziridine precursor.",

Discovery of a simple and fast method for the conversion of 11CH3Ito[11C]-formaldehyde (11CH2O) encouraged us to label the co-factor of this enzyme. Preliminary studies conducted on cell lines have demonstrated a preferential uptake of [11-14C]-(R)-N5,N10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (14CH2H4folate) by cancerous cell vs. normal cells from the same organ (Saeed M., Sheff D. and Kohen A.

J Biol Chem 2011;286:33872\u201333878), pointing out 11CH2H4folate as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for cancer imaging. Herein we report the synthesis of 11CH2H4folate, which may serve as a potential PET tracer.In a remotely controlled module, methyl iodide (11CH3I) was bubbled into a reaction vial containing trimethylamine N-oxide in N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) and heated to 70\u00b0C for 2 min. Formaldehyde (11CH2O) formed after the completion of reaction was then mixed with a solution of freshly prepared tetrahydrofolate (H4folate) by using a fast chemoenzymatic approach to accomplish synthesis of 11CH2H4folate. Purification of the product was carried out by loading the crude reaction mixture on a SAX cartridge, washing with water to remove unbound impurities and finally eluting with a saline solution.The synthesis and purification of 11CH2H4folate were completed within 5 min. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis of the product after SAX purification indicates that more than 90% of the radioactivity that was retained on the SAX cartridge was in 11CH2H4folate, with minor (<10%) radioactivity due to unreacted 11CH2O.We present a fast (\u223c5 min) synthesis and purification of 11CH2H4folate as a potential PET tracer.

Periodic fluorescent and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography)/CT (computed tomography) images were acquired, and biodistributions were obtained at 22 h.Histological examination confirmed the validity of both the infection and inflammation animal models. Both the whole-body optical and nuclear images showed obvious accumulations in the target thigh in both models at all time points. At 22 h, the average target thigh accumulation of 111In was 1.66%ID/g (S.D. 0.15) in the infection mice compared to 0.58%ID/g (S.D. 0.07) in the inflammation mice (P<.01), and the 111In target/normal thigh ratio was 2.8 fold higher in the infection animals compared to the inflammation animals.These preliminary results show that Zn-DPA within streptavidin targets S. pyogenes-infected mice similarly to its free fluorescent analogue.

Also, ex vivo biodistribution of 68Ga radioactivity was analyzed.All four 68Ga tracers showed undesirably slow myocardial accumulation over time, but their in vivo stability, clearance from blood and the kinetics of the myocardium uptake varied.

     "abstract": "Measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in rodents can provide knowledge of pathophysiology of the cerebral circulation, but generally requires blood sampling for analysis during positron emission tomography (PET). We therefore tested the feasibility of using an arteriovenous (AV) shunt in rats for less invasive blood analysis.Six anesthetized rats received [15O]H2O and [15O]CO PET scans with their femoral artery and vein connected by an AV shunt, the activity within which was measured with a germanium ortho-oxysilicate scintillation detector. The [15O]H2O was intravenously injected either at a faster or slower injection rate, while animals were placed either with their head or heart centered in the gantry. The time\u2013activity curve (TAC) from the AV shunt was compared with that from the cardiac ventricle in PET image. The rCBF values were calculated by a nonlinear least-square method using the dispersion-corrected AV-shunt TAC as an input.The AV-shunt TAC had higher signal-to-noise ratio, but also had delay and dispersion compared with the image-derived TAC. The delay time between the AV-shunt TAC and image-based TAC ranged from 11 to 21 s, while the dispersion was estimated to be \u223c5 s as a time constant of the dispersion model of exponential function, and both were properly corrected. In a steady-state condition of [15O]CO PET, the blood activity concentration by AV-shunt TAC was also comparable in height with the image-based TAC corrected for partial volume. Whole-brain CBF values measured by [15O]H2O were 0.37\u00b10.04 (mean\u00b1S.D.) ml/g/min, partition coefficient was 0.73\u00b10.04 ml/g, and the CBF varied in a linear relationship with partial pressure of carbon dioxide during each scan.The AV-shunt technique allows less invasive, quantitative and reproducible measurement of rCBF in [15O]H2O PET studies in rats than direct blood sampling and radioassay.",

In contrast, the combined therapy involving 90Y-B3 with paclitaxel showed a striking synergistic effect in shrinking tumors and prolonging the survival time (P<.001); on day 120, three of nine mice (33%) and six of six mice (100%) were alive without tumor when treated with 60 \u03bcCi 90Y-B3 and 100 \u03bcCi 90Y-B3, respectively. The addition of bevacizumab treatment 1 day before the combined therapy of 60 \u03bcCi 90Y-B3 with paclitaxel did not produce a statistically significant increase in survival when compared to the 90Y-B3 with paclitaxel (P>.10). Fluorescence microscopy analysis indicated that paclitaxel increased, whereas bevacizumab decreased, the accumulation and penetration of Alexa Fluor 647-B3 into tumor microenvironment compared to the control (P<.05).Our findings on the paclitaxel effect support a hypothesis that the increased tumor accumulation and penetration of 90Y-B3 as well as the high radiosensitization of tumor cells by paclitaxel may be the major factors responsible for the synergistic effect of the combined therapy involving 90Y-B3 with paclitaxel.",

Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) are promising techniques for identifying bone tumors using gamma- or positron-emitting labeled radiotracers, but the same tracers if labeled with beta-emitters may also be used to apply therapeutic radionuclides for localized irradiation. For the tracer development specifically accumulating in osseous lesions, animal models of bone metastasis are needed. A technique was developed for tumor cell injection into the circulation of the hind limb of rats. For tumor implantation, the arteria epigastrica caudalis superficialis (a branch of the femoral artery) was cannulated, and 2\u00d7105 cells were injected. By using the allogenic Walker 256 mammary carcinoma cell line, isolated bone metastases were induced. For visualizing of the tumor growth, PET with 18F-fluoride was performed weekly on a \u03bc-PET system. After 2\u20133 weeks, tumor invasion was confirmed by histology. Three weeks after tumor cell inoculation, PET images showed signs of bone metastases in 9 out of 11 animals. The tumors were located either in the proximal tibia/fibula or in the distal femur. At this time, the animals showed no restrictions in mobility. The tumors grew constantly over time. The final histological analysis showed tumors growing invasively into the bone matrix. With this model, new SPECT or PET tracers can be evaluated for their potency of accumulating in bone metastases in vivo and to determine which are therefore suitable for diagnosis and/or therapy.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the coordination yield of yttrium- and lutetium-DOTATATE complexes when the reaction is performed in the presence of varying amounts of competing cationic impurities. In the first set of experiments, the preparation of the samples was performed by using natural yttrium and lutetium (20.4 nmol). The molar ratio between DOTATATE and these metals was 1 to 1. Metal competitors (Pb2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, Al3+, Ni2+, Co2+, Cr3+) were added separately to obtain samples with varying molar ratio with respect to yttrium or lutetium (0.1, 0.5, 1, 2 and 10). The final solutions were analyzed through ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with an UV detector. In the second set of experiments, an amount of 90Y or 177Lu chloride (6 MBq corresponding to 3.3 and 45 pmol, respectively) was added to the samples, and a radio-thin layer chromatography analysis was carried out. The coordination of Y3+ and Lu3+ was dramatically influenced by low levels of Zn2+, Cu2+ and Co2+. Pb2+ and Ni2+ were also shown to be strong competitors at higher concentrations. Fe3+ was expected to be a strong competitor, but the effect on the incorporation was only partly dependent on its concentration. Al3+ and Cr3+ did not compete with Y3+ and Lu3+ in the formation of DOTATATE complexes.",

A disadvantage of (R)-[11C]verapamil is the fact that its main metabolite, [11C]D617, also enters the brain. For quantitative analysis of (R)-[11C]verapamil data, it has been assumed that the cerebral kinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil and [11C]D617 are the same. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the cerebral kinetics of (R)-[11C]verapamil and [11C]D617 are indeed similar and, if so, whether [11C]D617 itself could serve as an alternative PET tracer for P-gp.[11C]D617 was synthesized and its ex vivo biodistribution was investigated in male rats at four time points following intravenous administration of [11C]D617 (50 MBq) without (n=4) or with (n=4) pretreatment with the P-gp inhibitor tariquidar (15 mg\u00b7kg\u22121, intraperitoneally).

However, its regular application is often limited by low radiochemical yields and the use of a troublesome HPLC separation. Moreover, a high content of ethanol, at least one-fold higher than the European Pharmacopoeia and US Pharmacopoeia's established limit, is always present in the final product. The present study reports an optimization of the reaction conditions and a simple and straightforward purification step which affords a solution of [18F]FLT suitable for human use.Several conditions and materials were tested for both the nucleophilic substitution and purification step. The latter was achieved by means of a series of commercial solid-phase extraction cartridges. Very conveniently, the whole one-pot synthesis was carried out on commercial automated modules using basically the same setup employed for the synthesis of [18F]FDG.Under routine conditions, radiochemical yields of 37% [decay-corrected to start of synthesis (SOS)] were achieved in ca. 39 min from SOS, with radiochemical purities >98% (usually >99%). The negligible radiolysis observed could be easily suppressed by adding 0.5% of EtOH. Typical unlabelled chemical impurities detected were thymidine (0.15 ppm), thymine (0.28 ppm) and stavudine (0.05 ppm).A reliable, simple and efficient preparation of [18F]FLT has been developed, able to afford an ethanol-free solution of the tracer with no need for any HPLC purification. Because of its similarity to the [18F]FDG synthesis, the method can be readily implemented on basically all the commercial modules developed for this common radiotracer.",

While adsorption chromatography serves as a mechanism for selective elution of sodium pertechnetate from technetium generators, this method of purification is not sufficient for many alternative production methods. Several ion-separation/solid phase extraction chromatography methods are known, yet none have been demonstrated on cyclotron-produced [99mTc]TcO4\u2212. Herein we describe the design, manufacture and optimization of a remotely operated module for the purification of sodium pertechnetate from a bulk solution of molybdate.The automated purification module was designed to separate [99mTc]TcO4\u2212 using either Dowex 1x8 or an Aqueous Biphasic Extraction Chromatography (ABEC) resin. 100Mo composite targets were irradiated with 18.5 MeV protons for 10 \u03bcA\u00b7h using an ASCI TR19 cyclotron. Once purified, the radiopharmaceutical quality of 99mTcO4\u2212 isolated from each process (Dowex and/or ABEC) was established by assaying for molybdate breakthrough, alumina levels and, in the case of the Dowex approach, residual organics.The separation processes are efficient (75% for Dowex, 90% for ABEC) and complete in less than 30 min. Overall, up to 2.1 GBq of 99mTc was produced using the 100Mo(p,2n)99mTc transformation, processed using the separation module and subjected to a detailed chemical and radionuclidic analysis. Due to its expense and limited availability, 100MoO42\u2212 was recovered in >90% yield using a precipitation/filtration/lyophilization approach.Na[99mTc]TcO4 was produced using a medical cyclotron, recovered using an automated purification module and found to exceed all established quality control parameters.",

DOTA-AE105 and DOTA-AE105-NH2 labeled with 64Cu have previously been demonstrated to be able to noninvasively monitor uPAR expression using positron emission tomography (PET) in human cancer xenograft mice models. Here we introduce 68Ga-DOTA-AE105-NH2 and 68Ga-NODAGA-AE105-NH2 and evaluate their imaging properties using small-animal PET.Synthesis of DOTA-AE105-NH2 and NODAGA-AE105-NH2 was based on solid-phase peptide synthesis protocols using the Fmoc strategy. 68GaCl3 was eluted from a 68Ge/68Ga generator. The eluate was either concentrated on a cation-exchange column or fractionated and used directly for labeling. For in vitro characterization of both tracers, partition coefficient, buffer and plasma stability, uPAR binding affinity and cell uptake were determined. To characterize the in vivo properties, dynamic microPET imaging was carried out in nude mice bearing human glioma U87MG tumor xenograft.In vitro experiments revealed uPAR binding affinities in the lower nM range for both conjugated peptides and identical to AE105. Labeling of DOTA-AE105-NH2 and NODAGA-AE105-NH2 with 68Ga was done at 95\u00b0C and room temperature, respectively. The highest radiochemical yield and purity were obtained using fractionated elution, whereas a negative effect of acetone on labeling efficiency for NODAGA-AE105-NH2 was observed. Good stability in phosphate-buffered saline and mouse plasma was observed. High cell uptake was found for both tracers in U87MG tumor cells. Dynamic microPET imaging demonstrated good tumor-to-background ratio for both tracers. Tumor uptake was 2.1% ID/g and 1.3% ID/g 30 min postinjection and 2.0% ID/g and 1.1% ID/g 60 min postinjection for 68Ga-NODAGA-AE105-NH2 and 68Ga-DOTA-AE105-NH2, respectively. A significantly higher tumor-to-muscle ratio (P<.05) was found for 68Ga-NODAGA-AE105-NH2 60 min postinjection.The use of 68Ga-DOTA-AE105-NH2 and 68Ga-NODAGA-AE105-NH2 as the first gallium-68 labeled uPAR radiotracers for noninvasive PET imaging is reported, which combine versatility with good imaging properties. These new tracers thus constitute an interesting alternative to the 64Cu-labeled version (64Cu-DOTA-AE105 and 64Cu-DOTA-AE105-NH2) for detecting uPAR expression in tumor tissue. In our hands, the fractionated elution approach was superior for labeling of peptides, and 68Ga-NODAGA-AE105-NH2 is the favored tracer as it provides the highest tumor-to-background ratio.",

In human studies, a 90-min dynamic PET scan was performed in seven healthy volunteers after injection of [18F]DPA-714 (245\u00b145 MBq). Arterial and venous samples were collected from two subjects, and two additional subjects were submitted to whole-body acquisition. Regions of interest were defined over cerebral structures to obtain mean time\u2013activity curves and to estimate the distribution volume ratios by Logan graphical analysis, and over peripheral organs to obtain standard uptake values.The effective dose estimated from biodistribution in mice was 17.2 \u03bcSv/MBq. Modeling of regional brain and plasma data showed good in vivo stability of [18F]DPA-714 in humans, with only 20% of blood metabolites 20 min postinjection (p.i.). Maximum cerebral uptake was observed 5 min p.i., followed by two decreasing phases: a rapid washout (5\u201330 min) followed by a slower phase for the remainder of PET acquisition. Whole-body images demonstrate high activity in the gallbladder, heart, spleen and kidneys.This initial study in humans shows that [18F]DPA-714 is a promising PET radioligand with excellent in vivo stability and biodistribution, and acceptable effective dose estimation.

A small 12-mer d-enantiomeric peptide (amino acid sequence=QSHYRHISPAQV), denoted as D1, has high binding affinity to A\u03b2 in vitro in the sub-micromolar range, and consequently, its radiolabeled analogues have a potential as radioligands for visualizing amyloid plaques in vivo by PET.The aims of the present work were to develop three different potent D1 derivative peptides labeled with fluorine-18 and to examine them in the AD and control postmortem human brain by autoradiography (ARG).Three different D1 derivative peptides were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 ([18F]ACI-87, [18F]ACI-88, [18F]ACI-89) using the prosthetic group N-succinimidyl-4-[18F]fluorobenzoate ([18F]SFB) and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Preliminary ARG measurements were performed in AD and control brains.The three fluorine-18-labeled d-peptides were obtained in a total synthesis time of 140 min with radiochemical purity higher than 98%.

ARG demonstrated a higher radioligand uptake in the cortical gray matter and the hippocampus in the AD brain as compared to age-matched control brain.Fluorine-18 labeling of the three novel D1 derivative peptides using [18F]SFB was successfully accomplished. Higher contrast between AD and control brain slices demonstrates their potential applicability for further use in vivo by PET.",

Despite some favorable clinical properties evidenced during phase I and phase II studies, the overall results of the European and American phase III clinical studies have been judged insufficient for a successful approval process by the regulatory agencies.Non-carrier-added and carrier-added experiments using short-lived 99mTc and long-lived 99gTc have been utilized to prepare a series of bis-substituted [Tc(N)(DTC)2] complexes [DTC=dithiocarbamate(1\u2212)].

[18F]LBT-999 PET studies in baboons showed a lower brain uptake than [11C]LBT-999 and a high bone uptake, suggesting the presence of interfering metabolites. Therefore, in vitro and in vivo metabolism of these radiotracers was investigated.Rat and human liver microsomal incubations, baboon plasma and rat brain extracts were analyzed by radio-HPLC and LC-MS-MS.In vitro experiments demonstrated the formation by P450s of five polar metabolites. The main routes of LBT-999 metabolism proposed were N-dealkylation, tolyl-hydroxylation and dealkylation plus tolyl-hydroxylation. In vivo in baboons, [18F]LBT-999 was rapidly converted into a [18F]hydroxylated metabolite likely oxidized in plasma into a [18F]carboxylic acid and into unlabeled N-dealkyl-LBT-999. The latter was detected in baboon plasma and in rat brain by LC-MS-MS. The time course of unchanged [18F]LBT-999 decreased rapidly in plasma and was higher than that of [11C]LBT-999 due to the formation of unlabeled N-dealkyl-LBT-999. In rats, striatum-to-cerebellum ratios of [18F]LBT-999, [18F]hydroxylated and [18F]acidic metabolite were 20, 4.2 and 1.65, respectively, suggesting a possible accumulation of the hydroxylated compound in the striatum.P450s catalyzed the formation of dealkylated and hydroxylated metabolites of LBT-999. In baboons, an extensive metabolism of [18F]LBT-999, with formation of unlabeled N-dealkyl-LBT-999, [18F]fluorobutenaldehyde (or its oxidation product) and [18F]hydroxy-LBT-999 able to penetrate the brain, prevented an easy and accurate estimation of the input function of the radiotracer.

Iron is an essential element for majority of organisms and plays an important role in virulence of pathogenic organisms. 68Ga is a positron emitter with complexing properties comparable to those of Fe(III) and readily available from a generator. Initial studies with 68Ga-triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC) showed excellent targeting properties in a rat infection model. We report here on the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of other siderophores radiolabelled with 68Ga as potential radiopharmaceuticals for infection imaging.68Ga labelling was performed using acetate buffer. Stability, log P and protein binding values were determined. In vitro uptake was tested using iron-deficient and iron-sufficient Aspergillus fumigatus (A.f.) cultures. Biodistribution of 68Ga-siderophores was studied in Balb/c mice.Significant differences among studied siderophores were observed in labelling efficiency, stability and protein binding. Uptake in A.f. cultures was highly dependent on iron load and type of the siderophore. In mice, 68Ga-TAFC and 68Ga-ferrioxamine E (FOXE) showed rapid renal excretion and low blood values even at a short period after injection; in contrast, 68Ga-ferricrocin and 68Ga-ferrichrome revealed high retention in blood and 68Ga-fusarinine C showed very high kidney retention.Some of the studied siderophores bind 68Ga with high affinity and stability, especially 68Ga-TAFC and 68Ga-FOXE. Low values of protein binding, high and specific uptake in A.f., and excellent in vivo biodistribution make them favourable agents for Aspergillus infection imaging.",

Glycolysis was stimulated by 24 h of exposure to the nitric oxide donor, sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Cell viability was assessed by MTT and clonogenic assays. Apoptosis was evaluated by ELISA of cytosolic DNA fragments and Western blots of cleaved caspase-3.SNP stimulation (0.1 and 1 mM) augmented CPAE cell 18F-FDG uptake to 2.6- and 4.6-fold of controls without adverse effects. Treatment with 333 \u03bcCi/ml 18F-FDG alone reduced viable cell number to 35.4% of controls by Day 3. Combining 0.1 mM SNP stimulation significantly enhanced the killing effect, reducing cell numbers to 19.2% and 39.2% of controls by 333 and 167 \u03bcCi/ml of 18F-FDG, respectively. 18F-FDG also suppressed clonogenic survival to 80.8% and 43.2% of controls by 83 and 167 \u03bcCi/ml, which was again intensified by SNP to 59.7% and 21.1% of controls.

Combining SNP stimulation significantly increased both of these levels to 1.8-fold of control cells.High-dose 18F-FDG combined with nitric oxide-stimulated glycolysis is an effective method to inhibit endothelial cell survival and promote apoptosis.

Pancreases were assayed for insulin content after the imaging study.Site-specifically labeled [18F]Ex(9\u201339) was purified on a G15 open column with radiochemical and chemical purities >98%. Positron emission tomography imaging showed pancreatic standardized uptake value (SUV) peaked at 10 min and plateaued by 50 min to the end of scan (240 min). No correlations of pancreatic SUV with postmortem measures of insulin content were seen.[18F]Ex(9\u201339) was successfully prepared and used for PET imaging for the first time to measure pancreatic BCM. The results suggest that derivatization of the Lys27 residue might reduce binding affinity, as evidenced by the absence of specific binding.

Additionally, 64Cu-ATSM uptake showed correlate change to the NADH and NADPH levels, but not oxygenic conditions. 2SD cells showed increased 64Cu-ATSM uptake under normoxia as compared with the control 2SA, and 64Cu-ATSM uptake followed NADH and NADPH levels, but not oxygenic conditions.64Cu-ATSM accumulated in cells with overreduced states due to mitochondrial dysfunction, even under normoxia. We recently reported that 62Cu-ATSM-PET can visualize stroke-like episodes maintaining oxygen supply in MELAS patients. Taken together, our data indicate that \u204eCu-ATSM uptake reflects overreduced intracellular states, despite oxygenic conditions; thus, \u204eCu-ATSM would be a promising marker of intracellular overreduced states for disorders with mitochondrial dysfunction, such as MELAS, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.",

The effect of cyclosporin A on the pharmacokinetic behaviour of 99mTc-TMEOP was evaluated by both ex vivo biodistribution and in vivo planar imaging studies.Subcellular distribution studies showed that more than 73% of 99mTc-TMEOP was associated with the mitochondrial fraction.

[18F]LBT-999 was first labelled with carbon-11; we will now describe its in vivo behaviour in comparison to that of [11C]LBT-999.Positron emission tomography (PET) experiments (baboons) confirmed the high affinity/specificity of [18F]LBT-999 for DAT. The brain regional distribution was in accordance with that of DAT. Pre-treatment with LBT-999 (1 mg/kg iv), but not with desipramine, a norepinephrine (NET) antagonist, reduced the striatum-to-cerebellum ratio by 96%, confirming the specificity for DAT vs. NET. The parent compound decreased rapidly and represented 24.3\u00b15.0% of plasma radioactivity at 30 min pi. Whole-body scans showed an important bone uptake of free fluorine following metabolism of [18F]LBT-999. In the cerebellum and striatum, distribution volumes increased by 30\u201340% between 80 and 230 min, suggesting the polluting role of a radiometabolite(s). [11C]LBT-999 exhibited a 40% higher standardized uptake value in the striata. This difference is likely due to N-dealkylation followed by [18F]fluoride release. 2\u03b2-Carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4\u2032-tolyl) nortropane is then formed, while [11C]2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4\u2032-tolyl) nortropane is formed following injection of [11C]LBT-999. This metabolite has high affinity for the DAT. In one specific PET experiment, intravenous injection of this metabolite induced a strong displacement of [18F]LBT-999 in the striata, confirming that this metabolite readily crosses the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and binds to DAT.[18F]LBT-999 is N-dealkylated in vivo to yield (1) a nonradioactive metabolite that crosses the BBB and has a high affinity for the DAT and (2) a [18F]fluoro-alkyl chain which is further defluorinated. The temporal changes in distribution volumes are consistent with the accumulation of a radiometabolite(s) in the brain. Therefore, the quantification of DAT density with [18F]LBT-999 is rather difficult.",

Herein, we report the synthesis and biological evaluation of three novel halogenated 6-substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline based EGFR-TKIs. Radiosynthesis (125I and 18F) of the corresponding analogues was also performed.6a, 6b and 8 were obtained by reaction of 6-amino-4-anilinoquinazoline (5) with 3-/4-iodobenzoyl and 4-fluorobenzoyl chlorides. Inhibition of EGFR autophosphorylation and A431 cellular proliferation were assessed by Western blot and MTT assays. 125I-anilinoquinazolines [125I]6a/b were prepared via destannylation of the corresponding tributylstannyl precursors with [125I]NaI. Cellular uptake studies were conducted in A431 cells. Optimization of the radiosynthesis of the 18F-anilinoquinazoline [18F]8 was attempted by nucleophilic substitution of the trimethylammonium- and nitro-6-substituted 4-anilinoquinazoline precursors.6a, 6b and 8 were synthesized in high chemical yield. All of them are inhibitors of EGFR autophosphorylation (0.1<IC50<1 \u03bcM) and A431 cell proliferation (IC50<3.5 \u03bcM). [125I]6a/b, obtained in high radiochemical purity and specific activity, were highly taken up by A431 cells. Biodistribution profile in mice indicated fast blood clearance and hepatobiliary excretion. Despite all attempts, [18F]8 was only formed in 4% yield, hampering further biological evaluation.This study suggests that these quinazoline derivatives can act as EGFR-TKI, warranting further modifications in the chemical structure in order to be explored as potential molecular imaging agents for single photon emission computerized tomography and positron emission tomography.",

It features a central compartment (blood) exchanging with organs. The structure describes explicitly liver, kidneys, spleen, blood and urinary excretion. The linear model tended to overestimate systematically the activity in the liver and in the kidney compartments in the first 20 min post-administration.

The doxorubicin-treated group showed a significant (P=.04) decrease in cardiovascular perfusion reserve at 1.3\u00b10.2 compared with the control animals at 1.6\u00b10.2. Similar results were obtained for the MVO2 reserve (treated 1.8\u00b10.4 vs. controls 2.3\u00b10.3; P=.02).We describe an [11C]acetate PET rest\u2013stress protocol for the assessment of congestive heart failure in rats and its application to the follow-up of cardiotoxicity under doxorubicin chemotherapy. This is a rapid and reliable approach to the measurement of cardiac perfusion and oxygen consumption reserve that could be applied to the development of new strategies to reduce the cardiotoxicity of anthracycline.",

BPND using the cerebellum as reference region was obtained with four reference tissue methods applied to the [18F]FE-PE2I data that were compared with the kinetic and graphical analyses. In the whole-body study, estimates of adsorbed radiation were obtained in two cynomolgus monkeys.All reference tissue methods provided BPND values within 5% of the values obtained with the kinetic and graphical analyses. The shortest imaging time for stable BPND estimation was 54 min. The average effective dose of [18F]FE-PE2I was 0.021 mSv/MBq, similar to 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose.The results in nonhuman primates suggest that [18F]FE-PE2I is suitable for accurate and stable DAT quantification, and its radiation dose estimates would allow for a maximal administered radioactivity of 476 MBq in human subjects.",

Dosimetry is the measurement of radiation dose, but also commonly refers to the estimation of health risk associated with ionising radiation. This review describes radiation dosimetry of carbon-11-labelled molecules in the context of current PET research and the most widely used regulatory guidelines.A MEDLINE literature search returned 42 articles; 32 of these were based on human PET data dealing with radiation dosimetry of carbon-11 molecules. Radiation burden expressed as effective dose and maximum absorbed organ dose was compared between tracers.All but one of the carbon-11-labelled PET tracers have an effective dose under 9 \u03bcSv/MBq, with a mean of 5.9 \u03bcSv/MBq. Data show that serial PET scans in a single subject are feasible for the majority of radiotracers.Although differing in approach, the two most widely used regulatory frameworks (those in the USA and the EU) do not differ substantially with regard to the maximum allowable injected activity per PET study. The predictive validity of animal dosimetry models is critically discussed in relation to human dosimetry. Finally, empirical PET data are related to human dose estimates based on homogenous distribution, generic models and maximum cumulated activities. Despite the contribution of these models to general risk estimation, human dosimetry studies are recommended where continued use of a new PET tracer is foreseen.",

The aim of this work was to evaluate the conjugate 177Lu-h-R3 as a potential radioimmunoconjugate for radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of tumors overexpressing EGFR.h-R3 was modified with the macrocylcic ligand S-2-(4-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane tetraacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DOTA) and the acyclic ligand S-2-(4-Isothiocyanatobenzyl)-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (p-SCN-Bn-DTPA); the immunoconjugates were labeled with no-carried added 177Lu. Specificity and affinity were tested using radioimmunoassays in a cell line overexpressing EGFR. Biodistribution in mice, healthy or bearing A431 epithelial carcinoma xenografts, was performed for 11 days. Tumor uptake, the influence of the nature of the chelate and the way of administration were studied. Absorbed dose in tumor and selected organs was calculated using the OLINDA/EXM software; the data from the animals was extrapolated to humans.177Lu-h-R3 conjugates were obtained with specific activity up to 915 MBq/mg without significant loss of immunoreactivity. The binding of 177Lu-h-R3 conjugates to A431 cells showed to be EGFR specific, and the affinity was similar to native h-R3. Tumor uptake reached a maximum value of 22.4\u00b13.1 %ID/g at 72 h and remained \u223c20% ID/g over 1 week. Locoregional application showed better tumor/nontumor ratios than intravenous application.177Lu-h-R3 should be considered for further evaluations as a potential radiopharmaceutical for RIT of tumors overexpressing EGFR.",

A monoclonal antibody (MAb) specific for multiple molecular targets could expand the treatable patient population and the fraction of tumor cells targeted, with potentially increased efficacy. This motivated the generation of MAb D2C7, which recognizes both wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRwt) and a tumor-specific mutant, EGFRvIII.D2C7 binding affinity was determined by surface plasmon resonance and its specificity characterized through comparison to EGFRwt-specific EGFR.1 and EGFRvIII-specific L8A4 MAbs by flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analysis. The three MAbs were labeled with 125I or 131I using Iodogen, and paired-label internalization assays and biodistribution experiments in athymic mice with human tumor xenografts were performed.The affinity of D2C7 for EGFRwt and EGFRvIII was 5.2\u00d7109 M\u22121 and 3.6\u00d7109 M\u22121, and cell-surface reactivity with both receptors was documented by flow cytometry. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed D2C7 reactivity with malignant glioma tissue from 90 of 101 patients. Internalization assays performed on EGFRwt-expressing WTT cells and EGFRvIII-expressing NR6M cells indicated a threefold lower degradation of 125I-labeled D2C7 compared with 131I-labeled EGFR.1. Uptake of 125I-labeled D2C7 in NR6M xenografts (52.45\u00b113.97 %ID g\u22121 on Day 3) was more than twice that of 131I-labeled L8A4; a threefold to fivefold tumor delivery advantage was seen when compared to 131I-labeled EGFR.1 in mice with WTT xenografts.These results suggest that D2C7 warrants further evaluation for the development of MAb-based therapeutics against cancers expressing EGFRwt and EGFRvIII.",

After intravenous administration of 188Re-liposome, tumor accumulation from the radioactivity was observed. Levels of radioactivity in tumors were maintained at steady levels (from 5.40 to 5.67 %ID/g) after 4 to 24 h.

This includes obtaining a metabolite-corrected input function.We compared bolus injection with constant infusion in rats that were awake or under isoflurane anesthesia. Brain\u2013plasma and brain\u2013blood distribution ratios were calculated by dividing brain 18F concentrations, determined in vivo by positron emission tomography imaging with the Advanced Technology Laboratory Animal Scanner, ex vivo by direct counting in excised brain tissue or by quantitative autoradiography by the plasma or whole blood concentrations that had been corrected for metabolite contents.Blood volume constraints prevented adequate blood sampling to define a precise input function after bolus injection, thus preventing full kinetic analysis. Constant infusion, however, required fewer blood samples to define the input function, allowing calculation of distribution ratios, but complete equilibrium between plasma and tissue had not yet been reached after 120 min.Our results showed that the blood clearance and metabolism were too rapid to obtain a reproducible input function after bolus injection. The equilibrium distribution ratios did not lead to precise biochemical parameters, but the constant infusion was more suitable in that distribution ratios between tissue and plasma were statistically more precise. Constant infusion is the better approach for studying [18F]FP-TZTP by small animal imaging.",

In vitro assessment of ER\u03b1 levels of the new cell lines (MC7-L1 and MC4-L2 ER\u03b1-knockdown; ER\u03b1KD), compared to the parental cell lines, was performed by immunoblotting (\u221275% ER\u03b1 protein) and binding assays (\u221250% estrogen binding). These cell lines were implanted subcutaneously in Balb/c mice and allowed to grow up to a volume of at least 20 mm3. FES and [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET images were acquired to measure FES and FDG uptake in the various tumors.FES uptake as assessed by PET imaging was 1.06\u00b10.21 percent injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g) for MC7-L1 tumors and 0.47\u00b10.08 %ID/g for MC7-L1 ER\u03b1KD tumors. MC4-L2 tumors had a FES uptake of 1.03\u00b10.30 %ID/g, whereas its ER\u03b1KD equivalent was 0.51\u00b10.19 %ID/g. Each ER\u03b1KD tumor had a significantly lower %ID/g value, by \u223c50%, than its ER+ counterpart. Biodistribution studies confirmed these findings and gave %ID/g values that were not significantly different from PET imaging data. FDG PET showed no significant uptake difference between the ER+ and ER\u03b1KD tumors, indicating that the metabolic phenotype of the ER\u03b1KD cell lines was not altered.FES PET imaging was able to reliably differentiate between tumors having differences in their ER\u03b1 expression in vivo, in a mouse model. Quantitative data obtained by FES PET were in concordance with biodistribution studies and in vitro assays.

Thereby, this study investigated the influence of mass dose of laniquidar, desmethyl-loperamide and loperamide on the P-glycoprotein-mediated brain uptake of, respectively, [11C]-laniquidar and [11C]-N-desmethyl-loperamide ([11C]-dLop).Wild-type (WT) mice were injected intravenously with solutions of 5.6 MBq [11C]-laniquidar (either no carrier added or 60 mg/kg laniquidar added) or with 5.0\u20137.4 MBq [11C]-dLop (either no carrier added or 3 mg/kg desmethyl loperamide). Mice were killed, and brain and blood were collected, weighted and counted for radioactivity. Mdr1a(\u2212/\u2212) knockout mice were incorporated as the control group.Injection of 11C-laniquidar (no carrier added) in WT mice resulted in a statistical significant lower brain uptake (0.7\u00b10.2 %ID/g) compared to the carrier-added formulation (60 mg/kg laniquidar) (3.1\u00b10.3 %ID/g) (P=.004), while no statistical difference could be observed between formulations of [11C]-dLop. The [11C]-laniquidar and [11C]-dLop blood concentrations were not significantly different between the tested formulations in WT mice. In control animals, no effect of mass amount on brain uptake of both tracers could be demonstrated.These results demonstrate the bivalent character of laniquidar, acting as a substrate at low doses and as a blocking agent for P-glycoprotein transport in the brain at higher doses. In comparison, no difference was observed in [11C]-dLop uptake between carrier- and no-carrier-added formulations, which confirms that desmethyl-loperamide is a substrate of P-glycoprotein at the blood\u2013brain barrier.",

     "abstract": "Previously, development of novel brain radiotracers has largely relied on simple screening tools. Improved selection methods at the early stages of radiotracer discovery and an increased understanding of the relationships between in vitro physicochemical and in vivo radiotracer properties are needed. We investigated if high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methodologies could provide criteria for lead candidate selection by comparing HPLC measurements with radiotracer properties in humans.Ten molecules, previously used as radiotracers in humans, were analysed to obtain the following measures: partition coefficient (Log P); permeability (Pm); percentage of plasma protein binding (%PPB); and membrane partition coefficient (Km). Relationships between brain entry measurements (Log P, Pm and %PPB) and in vivo brain percentage injected dose (%ID); and Km and specific binding in vivo (BPND) were investigated. Log P values obtained using in silico packages and flask methods were compared with Log P values obtained using HPLC.The modelled associations with %ID were stronger for %PPB (r2=0.65) and Pm (r2=0.77) than for Log P (r2=0.47) while 86% of BPND variance was explained by Km. Log P values were variable dependant on the methodology used.Log P should not be relied upon as a predictor of blood-brain barrier penetration during brain radiotracer discovery. HPLC measurements of permeability, %PPB and membrane interactions may be potentially useful in predicting in vivo performance and hence allow evaluation and ranking of compound libraries for the selection of lead radiotracer candidates at early stages of radiotracer discovery.",

We evaluated the ability of radiolabeled isatins to quantify caspase-3 activity induced by the activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway by the anti-Fas antibody in mice.The behavior of three different radiolabeled isatins ([18F]WC-II-89, [18F]WC-IV-3 and [11C]WC-98) was characterized in mice with and without anti-Fas antibody treatment by microPET imaging and biodistribution studies. The activity of [18F]WC-II-89 was also compared with [99mTc]mebrofenin. The effect of pan-caspase inhibition with quinolyl-valyl-O-methylaspartyl-[2,6-difluorophenoxy]-methyl ketone (Q-VD-OPh) on [18F]WC-II-89 uptake was studied. Caspase-3 activity was confirmed by a fluorometric enzyme assay.All three tracers behaved similarly in microPET and biodistribution studies. Increased retention of all tracers was observed in the livers of treated animals and several other organs, all of which demonstrated increased caspase-3 enzyme activity; however, impaired hepatobiliary excretion made attribution of these findings to caspase-3 activity difficult. The isatin [18F]WC-II-89 was retained at statistically significantly higher levels in the organs after anti-Fas antibody treatment while [99mTc]mebrofenin activity cleared, suggesting specific binding to activated caspase-3, but the magnitude of increased binding was still relatively low. Caspase inhibition with Q-VD-OPh partially blocked [18F]WC-II-89 retention but completely blocked caspase-3 enzyme activity in the liver.The radiolabeled isatins appear to bind specifically to caspase-3 in vivo, but their sensitivity is limited. Further optimization is required for these tracers to be useful for clinical applications.",

It has several advantages over other imaging modalities, particularly in sensitive and quantitative investigations of molecular functions and processes in vivo. Recent advances in biopharmaceuticals development have increased interest in practical methods for proteins and peptides labeling with positron emitter radioisotope for PET molecular imaging. Here, we propose a novel approach for preparing positron emitter-labeled proteins and peptides based on biochemical synthesis using a reconstituted cell-free translation system. In this study, [11C]interleukin 8 (IL-8; MW 9.2 kDa) was successfully synthesized by the cell-free system in combination with l-[11C]methionine. The in vitro biochemical reaction proceeded smoothly and gave maximum radioactivity of [11C]IL-8 at 20 min with a radiochemical yield of 63%. Purification of [11C]IL-8 was achieved by conventional cation exchange and ultrafiltration methods, resulting in enough amount of radioactivity with excellent radiochemical purity (>95%) for small-animal imaging. This study clearly demonstrates that cell-free protein production system combined with positron emitter-labeled amino acid holds great promise as a novel approach to prepare radiolabeled proteins and peptides for PET imaging.",

A methodology for determining the distribution and fate of modified MBs quantitatively in vivo can be achieved by tagging MBs directly with 99mTc.

The 99mTc-labeled bubbles were isolated using a streptavidin-coated magnetic-bead purification strategy that did not disrupt the MBs. A small animal scintigraphic/CT imaging study as well as a quantitative biodistribution study was completed using 99mTcL1 and 99mTc-labeled bubbles in healthy C57Bl-6 mice.The imaging and biodistribution data showed rapid accumulation and retention of 99mTc-MBs in the liver (68.2\u00b16.6 %ID/g at 4 min; 93.3\u00b13.2 %ID/g at 60 min) and spleen (214.2\u00b119.7 %ID/g at 4 min; 213.4\u00b119.7 %ID/g at 60 min).

The conjugation, however, can alter the physical and immunological properties of the mAb, consequently affecting its tumor-targeting pharmacokinetics. In this study, we investigated the effect of the amount of 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-cyclohexyl-diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (CHX-A\u2033) conjugated to MORAb-009, a mAb directed against mesothelin, and the effect of MORAb dose on the biodistribution of 111In-labeled MORAb-009.We used nude mice bearing the A431/K5 tumor as a mesothelin-positive tumor model and the A431 tumor as a mesothelin-negative control. To find the optimal level of CHX-A\u2033 conjugation, CHX-A\u2033-MORAb-009 conjugates with 2.4, 3.5 and 5.5 CHX-A\u2033 molecules were investigated. To investigate the effect of injected MORAb-009 dose on neutralizing the shed mesothelin in the circulation, biodistribution studies were performed after the intravenous co-injection of 111In-labeled MORAb-009 (2.4 CHX-A\u2033/MORAb-009) with three different doses: 0.2, 2 and 30 \u03bcg of MORAb-009.The tumor uptake in A431/K5 tumor was four times higher than that in A431 tumor, indicating that the tumor uptake in A431/K5 was mesothelin mediated. The conjugate with 5.5 CHX-A\u2033 showed a lower isoelectric point (pI) and lower immunoreactivity (IR) than the 2.4 CHX-A\u2033 conjugate. These differences were reflected in the biodistribution of the 111In label. The 111In-labeled MORAb-009 conjugated with 2.4 CHX-A\u2033 produced higher tumor uptake and lower liver and spleen uptakes than the 5.5 CHX-A\u2033 conjugate. The biodistribution studies also revealed that the tumor uptake was significantly affected by the injected MORAb-009 dose and tumor size. The 30-\u03bcg dose produced higher tumor uptake than the 0.2- and 2-\u03bcg doses, whereas the 30-\u03bcg dose produced lower liver and spleen uptakes than the 0.2-\u03bcg dose.This study demonstrates that the number of chelate conjugation and the injected dose are two important parameters to achieve high tumor and low non-target organ uptake of 111In-labeled MORAb-009. This study also suggests that the injected dose of mAb could be individualized based on the tumor size or the blood level of shed antigen in a patient to achieve the ideal tumor-to-organ radioactivity ratios.",

Studies were performed to optimize the imaging time window for calculating standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) with correlation to distribution volume ratio (DVR) and in differentiating PD from normal controls (NCs).Thirteen 18F-AV-133 positron emission tomography studies were conducted on four NCs (age, 62.3\u00b14.9 years) and nine PD patients (age, 60.8\u00b16.0 years) with Hoehn and Yahr stages 2 to 3. Dynamic images were acquired within 180 min (0\u201330, 50\u2013140 and 160\u2013180 min) and were rearranged into 14 of 10-min scans. The contralateral striatum was defined as the opposite striatum to the predominantly affected limbs. Volumes of interest (VOIs) of bilateral putamen, caudate nuclei and occipital cortex (OC; as the reference region) were delineated from individual magnetic resonance imaging. SUVRs of striatum to OC were computed from 14 dynamic image sets. The DVRs were computed from Logan graphic analysis by using OC as the input. The performance of SUVR was evaluated based on the correlation of SUVR at each time window to DVR, as well as the Cohen effect size (group mean SUVR difference between PD and NC/standard deviation).18F-AV-133 uptake decreased in PD subjects at bilateral striatum especially at contralateral side with posterior putamen predominant as compared with NC. Consistent higher correlations of SUVRs to DVR for all VOIs were observed at later time window and reached to its maximal value of 0.9917 at 90\u2013100 min. The group mean SUVR differences between NC and PD subjects increased and reached relatively stable values after 90 min. The effect sizes for all VOIs were stable across different time window and with the largest value around 90~120 min.The scanning time of 90\u2013100 min for 18F-AV-133 is considered as the optimal time window for summed uptake measurements in terms of SUVRs' correlation to DVRs, differential power, stability and clinical feasibility across and between NC and PD patients.",

Gamma camera images were acquired at 4 h after injection, and then organs were removed for gamma counting. Confocal microscope was used to confirm the migration of 99mTc-BMSCs by co-labeling with PKH26. Cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate apoptotic or necrotic change until the seventh day after labeling.99mTc-BMSCs were distributed mostly to lungs, liver and spleen at 4 h, and uptake of these organs was not significantly different between traumatic rats and controls. Meanwhile, the cerebral uptake of 99mTc-BMSCs was significantly higher in the traumatic rats than in controls (0.40% vs. 0.20%; P=.0002). Additionally, 99mTc-BMSCs' uptake of traumatic hemisphere was significantly higher than that of contralateral ones (0.27% vs. 0.13%; P=.0001) in traumatic rats. Regardless of radiolabeling, BMSCs migrated to traumatic regions, but not to nontraumatic hemispheres. However, gamma camera failed to demonstrate 99mTc-BMSCs in traumatic hemispheres. No significant apoptotic or necrotic change was observed until 7 days after radiolabeling.Early distribution of BMSCs in traumatic brain disease could be monitored by 99mTc-labeling, which does not induce cellular death.

Furthermore, changes in the level of plaque burden as quantified by an amyloid plaque PET tracer may provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of amyloid-targeted therapeutics. This work describes our approach to evaluate and select a candidate PET tracer for in vivo quantification of human amyloid plaque.Ligands were evaluated for their in vitro binding to human amyloid plaques, lipophilicity and predicted blood\u2013brain barrier permeability. Candidates with favorable in vitro properties were radiolabeled with 18F and evaluated in vivo. Baseline PET scans in rhesus monkey were conducted to evaluate the regional distribution and kinetics of each tracer using tracer kinetic modeling methods.

Quantification of DAT levels in the presynaptic site using 11C-N-2-carbomethoxy-3-(4-fluorophenyl)-tropane (11C-CFT) with positron emission tomography (PET) was applied in studies for Parkinson's disease. The current study investigated the changes in striatal DAT following HI brain injury in newborn piglets using 11C-CFT PET.Newborn piglets were subjected to occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries for 30 min and simultaneous peripheral hypoxia. Brain DAT imaging was performed using PET/CT with 11C-CFT as the probe in each group (including the control group and HI insult groups). Brain tissues were collected for DAT immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis at each time point post the PET/CT procedure. Sham controls had some operation without HI procedure.A few minutes after intravenous injection of 11C-CFT, radioactive signals for DAT clearly appeared in the cortical area, striatum and cerebellum of newborn piglets of sham control group and HI insult groups. HI brain insult markedly increased striatal DAT at an early period (P<.05 vs. sham controls) when neuronal pathological changes were mild. Changes in striatal DAT were absent at later period post-HI insult when neuronal injury became more severe. 11C-CFT PET imaging data and IHC DAT staining data were highly correlated (r=0.844, P<.05).HI brain injury resulted in a transient increase in striatal DAT. 11C-CFT PET/CT imaging data reflected the dynamic changes of DAT in the striatum in vivo.",

We have previously reported on the in vivo kinetics of trans-[18F]mefway in the nonhuman primate. In this work, we compare the in vivo binding of cis-[18F]mefway and trans-[18F]mefway to evaluate the properties of cis-[18F]mefway for 5-HT1A PET imaging.The cis- and trans-[18F]mefway tracers were synthesized via nucleophilic substitution with their respective tosyl precursors. Two monkeys (one male, one female) were given bolus injections of both cis- and trans-labeled [18F]mefway in separate experiments. Dynamic scans were acquired for 90 min with a microPET P4 scanner. Time\u2013activity curves were extracted in the areas of the mesial temporal cortex (MTC), anterior cingulate gyrus (aCG), insular cortex (IC), raphe nuclei (RN) and cerebellum (CB). The in vivo behavior of the radiotracers was compared based upon the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) using the CB as a reference region.Averaged over the two subjects, BPND values were as follows: MTC: 7.7, 0.58; aCG: 4.95, 0.32; IC: 3.27, 0.2; and RN: 3.05, 0.13, for trans-[18F]mefway and cis-[18F]mefway, respectively.The cis-labeled [18F]mefway tracer has low specific binding throughout the 5-HT1A regions of the brain compared to trans-[18F]mefway, suggesting that the target-to-background binding of cis-[18F]mefway may limit its use for in vivo assessment of 5-HT1A binding.",

Assessment of factors that could affect the quantitative level of FES uptake is important as part of the validation of FES PET for evaluating regional ER expression in breast cancer.This study examines FES uptake in tumors from 312 FES PET scans (239 patients) with documented ER+ primary breast cancer. FES uptake was compared to clinical and laboratory data, treatment prior to or at time of scan, and properties of FES and its metabolism and transport. Linear mixed models were used to explore univariate, threshold-based and multivariate associations.Sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) was inversely associated with FES SUV. Average FES uptake did not differ by levels of plasma estradiol, age or rate of FES metabolism. FES tumor uptake was greater for patients with a higher body mass index (BMI), but this effect did not persist when SUV was corrected for lean body mass (LBM). In multivariate analysis, only plasma SHBG binding was an independent predictor of LBM-adjusted FES SUV.Calculation of FES SUV, possibly adjusted for LBM, should be sufficient to assess FES uptake for the purpose of inferring ER expression. Pre-menopausal estradiol levels do not appear to interfere with FES uptake. The availability and binding properties of SHBG influence FES uptake and should be measured. Specific activity did not have a clear influence on FES uptake, except perhaps at higher injected mass per kilogram. These results suggest that FES imaging protocols may be simplified without sacrificing the validity of the results.",

In the present study, we used the ability to isolate human lymphoblastoid clones deficient in thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) to study how metabolism and nucleoside transport influence FLT uptake and retention.Transport and metabolism of FLT were measured in the human lymphoblastoid cell line TK6 and in eight clones isolated from TK6. Four clones were TK1-proficient, while four were TK1-deficient. Both influx and efflux of FLT were measured under conditions where concentrative and equilibrative transport could be distinguished.Sodium-dependent concentrative FLT transport dominated over equilibrative transport mechanisms and while inhibition of hENT1 reduced FLT uptake, there were no correlations between clonal variations in hENT1 levels and FLT uptake. There was an absolute requirement of TK1 for concentration of FLT in TK6 cells. FLT uptake reached a peak after 60 min of incubation with FLT after which intracellular levels of FLT and FLT metabolites declined. Efflux was rapid and was associated with reductions in FLT and each of its metabolites. Both FLT and FLT-monophosphate were found in the efflux buffer.Initial rates of FLT uptake were a function of both concentrative and equilibrative transporters. TK1 activity was an absolute requirement for the accumulation of FLT. Retention was dependent on nucleoside/nucleotide efflux and retrograde metabolism of FLT nucleotides.",

The tk(+)-to-tk(\u2212) cellular uptake ratio after a 2-h incubation was 66.6\u00b125.1, 76.3\u00b118.2 and 247.2\u00b137.2, respectively. In biodistribution studies, 18F-FIAC showed significant tk(+) tumor specificity (12.6; expressed as the tk(+)-to-tk(\u2212) tumor uptake ratio at 2 h postinjection) comparable with 18F-FIAU (15.8) but lower than 18F-FEAU (48.0). The results of microPET imaging also revealed the highly specific accumulation of these three radioprobes in the NG4TL4-tk(+) tumor.Our findings suggested that the cytidine analogue 18F-FIAC is a new potential PET probe for the imaging of HSV1-tk gene expression. 18F-FIAC may be regarded as the prodrug of 18F-FIAU in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Radiolabeled bombesin (BN) conjugates are promising radiotracers for imaging and therapy of breast and prostate tumors in which BN2/gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors are overexpressed. However, the low in vivo stability of BN conjugates may limit their clinical application. In an attempt to improve their pharmacokinetics and counteract their rapid enzymatic degradation, we prepared a series of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-ylated BN(7-14) analogues for radiolabeling with 99mTc(CO)3 and evaluated them in vitro and in vivo.Derivatization of a stabilized (N\u03b1His)Ac-BN(7-14)[Cha13,Nle14] analogue with linear PEG molecules of various sizes [5 kDa (PEG5), 10 kDa (PEG10) and 20 kDa (PEG20)] was performed by PEGylation of the \u025b-amino group of a \u03b23hLys-\u03b2Ala-\u03b2Ala spacer between the stabilized BN sequence and the (N\u03b1His)Ac chelator. The analogues were then radiolabeled by employing the 99mTc-tricarbonyl technique. Binding affinity and internalization/externalization studies were performed in vitro in human prostate carcinoma PC-3 cells. Stability was investigated in vitro in human plasma and in vivo in Balb/c mice. Finally, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/X-ray computed tomography studies were performed in nude mice bearing PC-3 tumor xenografts.PEGylation did not affect the binding affinity of BN analogues, as the binding affinity for BN2/GRP receptors remained high (Kd<0.9 nM). However, in vitro binding kinetics of the PEGylated analogues were slower. Steady-state condition was reached after 4 h, and the total cell binding was 10 times lower than that for the non-PEGylated counterpart. Besides, PEGylation improved the stability of BN conjugates in vitro and in vivo. The BN derivative conjugated with a PEG5 molecule showed the best pharmacokinetics in vivo, i.e., faster blood clearance and preferential renal excretion. The tumor uptake of the 99mTc-PEG5-Lys-BN conjugate was slightly higher compared to that of the non-PEGylated analogue (3.91%\u00b10.44% vs. 2.80%\u00b10.28% injected dose per gram 1 h postinjection, p.i.). Tumor retention was also increased, resulting in a threefold higher amount of radioactivity in the tumor at 24 h p.i. Furthermore, decreased hepatobiliary excretion and increased tumor-to-nontarget ratios (tumor-to-blood: 17.1 vs. 2.1; tumor-to-kidney: 1.1 vs. 0.4; tumor-to-liver: 5.8 vs. 1.0, 24 h p.i.) were observed and further confirmed via small-animal SPECT images 1 h p.i.PEGylation proved to be an effective strategy to enhance the tumor-targeting potential of 99mTc-labeled BN-based radiopharmaceuticals and probably other radiolabeled peptides.",

This study presents a first report on the potential of this 68Ga bone-seeking radiopharmaceutical in the detection of bone metastases.4-Amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate was conjugated with 2-[4,7-di(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazonan-1-yl]pentanedioic acid, yielding 2-[4,7-di(carboxymethyl)-1,4,7-triazonan-1-yl]-5-[(4-hydroxy-4,4-diphosphonobutyl)amino]-5-oxopentanoic acid (NOTA-BP). 68Ga-labeled NOTA-BP ([68Ga]NOTA-BP) was prepared by complexation of NOTA-BP with [68Ga] gallium chloride and evaluated in in vitro experiments, biodistribution experiments and micro-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging experiments.The labeling of NOTA-BP with 68Ga was completed by heating for 10 min. [68Ga]NOTA-BP was determined to have a radiochemical purity of over 95%, a high affinity for hydroxyapatite and a high stability in plasma. In in vivo biodistribution experiments, [68Ga]NOTA-BP demonstrated high bone uptake potential. Compared with 99mTc-labeled methylene diphosphonate ([99mTc]MDP) and [18F]fluoride, [68Ga]NOTA-BP exhibited faster blood clearance and a higher bone-to-blood ratio. In addition, mouse model bone metastasis was detected by micro-PET imaging at 1 h postinjection of [68Ga]NOTA-BP.We have developed a novel 68Ga-radiolabeled bone-seeking agent. This [68Ga]NOTA-BP complex was found to have a high bone affinity and rapid blood clearance, and may thus prove to be useful as a bone-seeking agent for clinical PET.",

The intermediates ethyl [18F]-fluorinated benzene and pyridine esters were reacted with hydrazine to produce the [18F]-fluorobenzene and pyridinecarbohydrazides, followed by coupling with N-hydroxysuccinimide-folate/MTX. Radiochemical yields were greater than 80% (decay corrected), with total synthesis time of less than 45 min. Radiochemical purities were always greater than 97% without high-performance liquid chromatography purification. These synthetic approaches hold considerable promise as rapid and simple method for the radiofluorination of folate derivatives with high radiochemical yield in short synthesis time. In vitro tests on KB cell line showed that significant amount of the radioconjugates were associated with cell fractions, and in vivo characterization in normal Balb/c mice revealed rapid blood clearance of these radioconjugates with excretion predominantly by the urinary and partially by the hepatobiliary systems. Biodistribution studies in nude mice bearing human KB cell line xenografts demonstrated significant tumor uptake and favorable biodistribution profile for [18F]-2-folate over the other conjugates. The uptake in the tumors was blocked by excess coinjection of folic acid, suggesting a receptor-mediated process. Micro-positron emission tomography images of nude mice bearing human KB cell line xenografts confirmed these observations. These results demonstrate that [18F]-2-folate may be useful as molecular probe for detecting and staging of folate receptor-positive cancers, such as ovarian cancer and their metastasis as well as monitoring tumor response to treatment.",

Several tracers based on the TBZ backbone, including 9-fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine ([18F]AV-133), have shown some promising results as potential biomarkers for BCM despite a relatively high background signal in the pancreas. In the present study, we explore the background binding characteristics of [18F]AV-133 in rat pancreas.Pancreatic exocrine cells and islet cells were isolated and purified from Sprague-Dawley rats. Membrane homogenates, prepared from both pancreatic exocrine and islet cells as well as from brain striatum regions, were used for in vitro binding studies of [18F]AV-133 under a selective masking condition. 1,3-Di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG), displaying high and roughly equal affinity for both sigma-1 and sigma-2 receptors, was chosen at 5 \u03bcM concentration for the masking/blocking studies.[18F]AV-133 binding to rat striatum homogenates was not significantly altered by the presence of DTG. In contrast, [18F]AV-133 showed significant competition with DTG for binding sites in rat pancreatic exocrine homogenates as well as in rat islet cell homogenates. Importantly, in the presence of DTG, [18F]AV-133 showed a single high-affinity binding site on islet cell homogenates with a Kd value of 3.8 nM which is consistent with the affinity reported previously for VMAT2 sites in rat pancreas.[18F]AV-133, in addition to a high-affinity VMAT2 binding site, binds with low affinity (but high capacity) to sigma components that are present in the rat pancreas. Identification of the cause of background binding of [18F]AV-133 to rat pancreatic tissue may lead to improved methods for quantification.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate in vivo uptake and single-dose toxicity of anti-2-[18F]FACPC-1 in animals as well as the individual organ and whole-body dose in humans.A DU145 xenograft rodent model was used to measure anti-2-[18F]FACPC-1 uptake at 15, 30 and 60 min post-injection. Animals were sacrificed and organs harvested to measure the percent injected activity per organ and to calculate residence time. Anti-2-[18F]FACPC-1 toxicity was assessed using a single microdose (37\u201374 MBq/kg) in nonhuman primates. Their vital signs were monitored for 2 h post-injection for drug-related effects.

Estimates of radiation dose from anti-2-[18F]FACPC-1 to the human body were calculated using recommendations of the MIRD committee and MIRDOSE 3.0 software.High anti-2-[18F]FACPC-1 residence time was observed in the pancreas of the rodent model compared to the human data. No abnormal treatment-related observations were made in the nonhuman primate toxicity studies. Human venous blood showed no metabolites of anti-2-[18F]FACPC-1 in the first 60 min post-injection.

The potential of 188Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol for hepatoma therapy was evaluated in a hepatocellular carcinoma animal model of Sprague\u2013Dawley rats implanted with the N1S1 cell line.Synthesis of H3MN-16ET was described, and characterization was identified by infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectra. We compared the effects of transchelating agents (glucoheptonate or tartaric acid) and a reducing agent (stannous chloride) on the complexing of 188Re-perrhenate and H3MN-16ET. Twenty-four rats implanted with hepatoma were injected with 3.7 MBq/0.1 ml of 188Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol or 188Re-MN-16ET via transcatheter arterial embolization. Biodistribution experiments and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging were performed to investigate tumor accumulation.H3MN-16ET was proved to easily conjugate with the Re isotope and showed good solubility in Lipiodol. The radiochemical purity of 188Re-MN-16ET/Lipiodol with 10 mg tartaric acid and stannous chloride was shown to be more than 90%.

Na+/I\u2212 symporter (NIS), thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR), thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) levels were detected by Western blotting and radioimmunoassay, and their mRNAs were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction.RAIU of FTC-133 cells decreased gradually after coincubation with 131I and did not recover even if 131I was removed. The relative RAIU of the control and experimental groups was 0.567 and 0.182, respectively, a statistically significant difference (P<.01). Expression of NIS, TSHR, TPO and Tg decreased in the experimental group to a statistically significant degree compared to that of controls (P<.05).Changes in the mRNA levels were in accordance with the expression of thyroid-specific proteins.

Therapeutic efficiency of [125I]ITdU was proven by clonogenic assay.[125I]ITdU was shown to be efficiently incorporated into DNA of malignant cells, providing a promising mechanism for delivering highly toxic Auger radiation emitters into tumor DNA. [125I]ITdU had a potent antimyeloma effect in cell lines representing distinct disease stages and, importantly, in cell lines sensitive or resistant to the conventional therapeutic agent, but was not toxic for normal plasma and bone marrow stromal cells. Furthermore, [125I]ITdU abrogated the protective actions of IL6 and IGF1 on MM cells.

     "abstract": "Unique uptake and retention mechanisms of positron emission tomography (PET) hypoxia tracers make in vivo comparison between them challenging. Differences in imaged uptake of two common hypoxia radiotracers, [61Cu]Cu-ATSM and [18F]FMISO, were characterized via computational modeling to address these challenges.An electrochemical formalism describing bioreductive retention mechanisms of these tracers under steady-state conditions was adopted to relate time-averaged activity concentration to tissue partial oxygen tension (PO2), a common metric of hypoxia. Chemical equilibrium constants of product concentration to reactant concentration ratios were determined from free energy changes and reduction potentials of pertinent reactions reported in the literature. Resulting transformation functions between tracer uptake and PO2 were compared against measured values in preclinical models. Additionally, calculated PO2 distributions from imaged Cu-ATSM tracer activity concentrations of 12 head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients were validated against microelectrode PO2 measurements in 69 HNSCC patients.Both Cu-ASTM- and FMISO-modeled PO2 transformation functions were in agreement with preclinical measured values within single-deviation confidence intervals. High correlation (r2=0.94, P<.05) was achieved between modeled PO2 distributions and measured distributions in the patient populations. On average, microelectrode hypoxia thresholds (2.5 and 5.0 mmHg) corresponded to higher Cu-ATSM uptake [2.5 and 2.0 standardized uptake value (SUV)] and lower FMISO uptake (2.0 and 1.4 SUV). Uncertainties in the models were dominated by variations in the estimated specific activity and intracellular acidity.Results indicated that the high dynamic range of Cu-ATSM uptake was representative of a narrow range of low oxygen tension whose values were dependent on microenvironment acidity, while FMISO uptake was representative of a wide range of PO2 values that were independent of acidity. The models shed light on possible causes of these discrepancies, particularly as it pertains to image contrast, and may prove to be a useful methodology in quantifying relationships between other hypoxia tracers. Comprehensive and robust assessment of tumor hypoxia prior to as well as in response to therapy may be best provided by imaging of multiple hypoxia markers that provide complementary rather than interchangeable information.",

The correlation between 99mTc-IL-18bp-Fc-IL-1ra uptake and 111In-labeled polymorphonuclear neutrophil infiltration was studied using ischemic\u2013reperfused rat hearts.Direct 99mTc-labeling yielded a stable dual-domain cytokine radioligand with radiochemical purity greater than 95% after gel filtration. Competitive binding studies showed specific targeting of 99mTc-IL-18bp-Fc-IL-1ra to inflammatory cells. The 99mTc-IL-18bp-Fc-IL-1ra uptake was 1.80\u00b10.17 % injected dose per gram (%ID/g) in the inflamed ear without blocking, whereas uptake in the presence of IL-18bp-Fc-IL-1ra was 1.09\u00b10.08 %ID/g (P<.05). The amounts of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 were significantly increased in the inflamed ears compared to the vehicle controls. A significant correlation of 99mTc-IL-18bp-Fc-IL-1ra with 111In-labeled neutrophil distribution was observed in the ischemic\u2013reperfused hearts (P<.001).Targeting proinflammatory cytokines with 99mTc-IL-18bp-Fc-IL-1ra may provide a suitable approach for specific detection of inflammatory sites.",

In vitro uptake of [18F]FAG by Escherichia coli was performed. Tissue biodistribution of [18F]FAG was performed in mice. Moreover, PET imaging acquisition of E. coli infection and nonbacterial inflammation models was performed in rats. Tissue radiotracer-accumulated sites were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin staining and anti\u2013E.coli immunostaining.The radiosynthesis of [18F]FAG was achieved with microwave irradiation, and the radiochemical yield was 9.7%\u00b12.8% end of bombardment (EOB); the radiochemical purity was more than 98%, and the total synthesis time was 62 min. Compared with control group, in vitro uptake of [18F]FAG by E. coli was significantly decrease in inhibition group (P<.05). Biodistribution studies in mice showed rapid clearance of [18F]FAG from the animal body. [18F]FAG clearly visualized the infection areas but not nonbacterial inflammation areas in PET studies. Quantitative analysis revealed that the uptake of [18F]FAG into infection areas was significantly higher than that of [18F]FAG into inflammation areas (P<.05). Histological analysis demonstrated the presence of bacterial cells at the sites of accumulation of [18F]FAG.Using 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-bromoacetamido-d-glucopyranose as a precursor, the new radiosynthesis method of [18F]FAG was achieved in fewer steps and with a shorter synthesis time than previously reported.

     "abstract": "Technetium-99m\u2013sestamibi (MIBI) is the most frequently used myocardial perfusion tracer in patients with ischemic heart disease. In patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, we previously found that the defect in myocardial MIBI uptake was the same in patients injected with MIBI before primary angioplasty and in patients injected immediately after successful treatment. Thus, reperfusion may not be followed by increased uptake of MIBI. Instead, the MIBI defect after reperfusion may reflect the area at risk (AAR) defined by MIBI injected before treatment. We intended to investigate whether myocardial imaging with MIBI administered after reperfusion reflects myocardial perfusion or rather the ischemic AAR.In 12 pigs, left anterior descending coronary artery was totally occluded for 45 min with an angioplasty balloon. After a 2-h reperfusion, MIBI was injected intravenously, and 153Gd-microspheres were injected in left atrium. AAR and infarct size (IS) were determined by histochemical staining. MIBI and microsphere distribution were evaluated by counting the sliced left ventricle on a gamma camera. Defects were defined as uptake less than 45% of maximum uptake.The mean\u00b1S.D. defect size as a fraction of left ventricle was for MIBI 21%\u00b15.5%, AAR 25%\u00b16.3%, IS 13%\u00b13.9% and microspheres defect size 7.3%\u00b15.5%. MIBI defect size overestimated IS (P=.0005) and microspheres defect size (P=.0001), but it was not significantly different from AAR (P=.30).In a porcine model of myocardial infarction after 45 min of ischemia, MIBI administered 120 min after reperfusion delineates AAR.",

The cells were administered either intravenously into the internal jugular vein (n=5) or intraarterially into the ascending aorta (n=1). Two of the pigs given intravenous administration were pretreated with low-molecular-weight dextran sulphate.The cellular kinetics and distribution were readily quantifiable for up to 120 min. High (78.6% of the administered cells) heterogeneous pulmonary uptake was found after completed intravenous transfusion. The pulmonary uptake was decreased either by preincubating and coadministrating the T-lymphoblasts with low-molecular-weight dextran sulphate or by administrating them intraarterially.The present work shows the feasibility of quantitatively monitoring and evaluating cell trafficking and distribution following administration of [18F]FDG-labeled T-lymphoblasts.

We tested the hypothesis that the autoradiographic method with a population-based input curve yields an approximation of FDG metabolism represented by the flux value Ki, which is less dependent on the acquisition time point than SUV.We analyzed 20 patients with chest tumors (16 males, age 65\u00b110 years). After injection of 350 MBq FDG using the INTEGO PET infusion system, a series of 35 scans of 10- to 300-s duration were acquired until 45 min. FDG flux was calculated using the Patlak method (Kipatlak) and also quantified with the autoradiographic method using the last acquisition only and the individual image-derived input function (Kiautoreal), as well as with a population-based input function (Kiautonorm). In a simulation study, the time courses of tumor SUV, tumor-to-blood ratio and tumor Ki values were calculated from 30 to 90 min.The FDG flux values (Ki) of the different tumors, obtained with the autoradiographic methods and the Patlak method, showed a high correlation. The simulation study showed a 16.8\u00b13.3% increase in the SUV values from 50 to 70 min, but only a 1.3\u00b12.8% change in the Ki values calculated with the autoradiographic method.Compared to the SUV, the autoradiographic Ki values are advantageous for various reasons. First, they are much less dependent on the time of acquisition than the SUV. Second, their calculation does not require the knowledge of the body weight or the injected activity. Furthermore, the values are comparable to the ones obtained with the widely accepted Patlak method. The method can be easily implemented in a clinical setting, as it uses only one static scan.",

     "abstract": "Noninvasive imaging of small animals to measure biodistributions and pharmacokinetics of radiolabeled agents is increasingly seen as an effective alternative to external counting of tissues obtained by sacrifice and dissection. However, we have observed important disagreements in measuring the accumulation of 111In-labeled antibodies in organs such as liver and kidneys when comparing imaging to ex vivo counting in the same animals. This study was conducted to establish whether this discrepancy could be minimized by selecting the region of interest (ROI) in images at the appropriate color threshold and by correcting for the estimated radioactivity within the blood pool of these organs during imaging.Vials with known concentrations of 111In as phantoms were imaged on a Bioscan NanoSPECT/CT. Thereafter, an 111In-DTPA-IgG antibody as the test agent was administered intravenously to normal rats, and whole body acquisitions were obtained at 2, 24 or 48 h. Immediately following imaging, the animals were sacrificed, the tissues were removed for ex vivo counting and the radioactivity accumulations were then compared.The phantom measurements showed that accuracy depended upon setting the correct ROI and that, in turn, depended upon setting the appropriate threshold of the color scale. Under the most unfavorable conditions, this error did not exceed 60%. Compared to the results of ex vivo counting, quantitation by imaging provided high values in liver and kidneys at all three time points by as much as 140%. However, by using the blood radioactivity at the time of sacrifice and the known blood volume in these organs, the disagreement was reduced in all cases to below 25%.In this study, the discrepancy in quantitating organ radioactivity accumulations between noninvasive imaging and necropsy was primarily due to blood pool radioactivity contributing to the in vivo images. The discrepancy may be minimized by subtracting an estimate of this contribution.",

Having the possibility to conjugate the targeting molecule with different radionuclides would offer more flexibility and potential advantages depending on clinical situations. Since various iodine isotopes are currently used in nuclear medicine and in pharmacological studies, we have evaluated which iodination method should be privileged in order to produce a good iodinated AM-derived nuclear medicine agent.Synthetic AM was labeled with iodine through chemical and lactoperoxidase oxidation methods. Position of the iodine atom on\u00a0the peptide was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis following cyanogen bromide cleavage and carboxypeptidase Y digestion. Binding affinity of iodinated AM analogues was evaluated by competition and saturation binding experiments on dog lung\u00a0preparations.In this study, we demonstrated that, upon lactoperoxidase oxidation, iodination occurred at Tyr1 and that this radioligand retained higher binding affinity and specificity over preparations obtained through chemical oxidation.These results emphasize the fact that even a small chemical modification, i.e. iodination, might deeply modify the pharmacological profile of a compound and support observations that the C-terminal tail of human AM plays an important role in the AM receptor binding process. Consequently, incorporation of a radionuclide to produce an AM-based nuclear medicine agent should privilege the N-terminus of the molecule.",

[11C]MP-10 was evaluated in vivo both in the pig and baboon brain.Alkylation of the corresponding desmethyl compound with [11C]methyl iodide produced [11C]MP-10 with good radiochemical yield and specific activity. PET studies in the pig showed that [11C]MP-10 rapidly entered the brain reaching peak tissue concentration at 1\u20132 min postadministration, followed by washout from the tissue. Administration of a selective PDE10A inhibitor reduced the binding in all brain regions to the levels of the cerebellum, demonstrating the saturability and selectivity of [11C]MP-10 binding. In the nonhuman primate, the brain tissue kinetics of [11C]MP-10 were slower, reaching peak tissue concentrations at 30\u201360 min postadministration. In both species, the observed rank order of regional brain signal was striatum>diencephalon>cortical regions=cerebellum, consistent with the known distribution and concentration of PDE10A. [11C]MP-10 brain kinetics were well described by a two-tissue compartment model, and estimates of total volume of distribution (VT) were obtained. Blocking studies with unlabeled MP-10 revealed the suitability of the cerebellum as a reference tissue and enabled the estimation of regional binding potential (BPND) as the outcome measure of specific binding. Quantification of [11C]MP-10 binding using the simplified reference tissue model with cerebellar input function produced BPND estimates consistent with those obtained by the two-tissue compartment model.We demonstrated that [11C]MP-10 possesses good characteristics for the in vivo quantification of the PDE10A in the brain by PET.",

In 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, %ID/g was significantly higher in the lesioned side compared to the intact side, and the baseline total %ID/g (data from both hemispheres were combined) was significantly higher compared to quinpirole stimulation starting from 4.5 min until the end of acquisition at 30 min.

     "abstract": "To enable imaging at an earlier time after injection, a radiopharmaceutical with higher affinity for bone, larger ratio of bone-to-soft tissue uptake and more rapid clearance from blood is required. The nature of diphosphonic acid is a key factor to determine the advantages of the radiopharmaceuticals. The purpose of this study is to optimize the linker chain between the imidazolyl and geminal diphosphonate group in the zoledronic acid (ZL) to develop novel single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) bone imaging agent.A novel ZL derivative, 1-hydroxy-3-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)propane-1,1-diyldiphosphonic acid (IPrDP), was successfully prepared and labeled with 99mTc in a high labeling yield. Biodistribution of 99mTc-IPrDP and 99mTc-ZL in normal mice were studied and compared. SPECT bone scanning was performed on the rabbit and a series of dynamic and static images were recorded by Philips SKY Light emission computed tomography.In the biodistribution studies, 99mTc-IPrDP exhibits significant advantages on the bone resorption and the clearance from soft tissues compared with 99mTc-ZL. Kinetics of blood clearance in mice showed that T1/2\u03b1 and T1/2\u03b2 of 99mTc-IPrDP were 1.47 min and 46.47 min, while those of 99mTc-ZL were 2.28 and 52.63 min respectively. Excellent images of the rabbit skeleton can be quickly obtained for 99mTc-IPrDP, which was faster than 99mTc-ZL and the clinically widely used bone imaging agent 99mTc-MDP (technetium-99m labeled with methylenediphosphonate).99mTc-IPrDP possesses excellent characteristics for the potential application as a novel bone scanning agent.",

Although we are interested in developing 68Ga-labeled bone imaging agents for PET, in these initial studies 67Ga was used because of its longer half-life.DOTA-conjugated bisphosphonate (DOTA-Bn-SCN-HBP) was synthesized by conjugation of 2-(4-isothiocyanatebenzyl)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid to 4-amino-1-hydroxybutylidene-1,1-bisphosphonate (alendronate). 67Ga-DOTA-Bn-SCN-HBP was prepared by coordination with 67Ga, and its in vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed.67Ga-DOTA-Bn-SCN-HBP was prepared with a radiochemical purity of over 95% without purification. 67Ga-DOTA-Bn-SCN-HBP had great affinity for hydroxyapatite in binding assay. In biodistribution experiments, 67Ga-DOTA-Bn-SCN-HBP accumulated in bone rapidly but was hardly observed in tissues other than bone. Pretreatment of an excess amount of alendronate inhibited the bone accumulation of 67Ga-DOTA-Bn-SCN-HBP.67Ga-DOTA-Bn-SCN-HBP showed ideal biodistribution characteristics as a bone-imaging agent. These findings should provide useful information on the drug design of bone imaging agents for PET with 68Ga.",

The purification was obtained using a recyclable SPE cartridge set.The three products, fluoromethylcholine, fluoroethylcholine and fluoropropylcholine, were obtained in good to optimum yields (22%\u201354% decay corrected) with a 15-min procedure. The production could be restarted several times for producing each one of the tracers without decrease in yields and purities, in accordance with a dose-on-demand (DOD) approach. The final products were formulated in isotonic saline solution.The described approach gives a proof of principle of the enhanced productivity obtainable using a microfluidic approach; in particular, the possibility to produce the reported tracers in a DOD fashion following a homogeneous synthetic and purification approach will foster further studies on the clinical evaluation of the best fluorocholine analogue for prostate cancer imaging without biasing for differences in radiochemical approach.",

Although the radiosynthesis has been proven to be reproducible and efficient, this complicated multistep reaction is difficult to incorporate into an automated cGMP-compliant radiosynthesis module for routine production.

In contrast to the ubiquitous positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 18F-labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose ([18F]2FDG) which is phosphorylated and trapped intracellularly, the substitution of fluorine for a hydroxyl group at carbon-6 in [18F]6FDG should prevent its phosphorylation. Consequently, [18F]6FDG has the potential to trace the transport step of glucose metabolism without the confounding effects of phosphorylation and subsequent steps of metabolism. Herein the focus is to determine whether, and the degree to which, [18F]6FDG remains unchanged following intravenous injection.Biodistribution studies were performed using 6FDG labeled with 18F or with the longer-lived radionuclides 3H and 14C.

[18F]-FESAHA was then synthesized in high radiochemical purity, and the logP and serum stability of the radiotracer were determined. In vitro cellular uptake experiments and acute biodistribution and small-animal PET studies were performed with [18F]-FESAHA in mice bearing LNCaP xenografts.[18F]-FESAHA was synthesized in high radiochemical purity via an innovative one-pot procedure. Enzymatic inhibition assays illustrated that FESAHA is a potent HDAC inhibitor, with IC50 values from 3 nM to 1.7 \u03bcM against the 11 HDAC subtypes. Cell proliferation experiments revealed that the cytostatic properties of FESAHA very closely resemble those of SAHA in both LNCaP cells and PC-3 cells. Acute biodistribution and PET imaging experiments revealed tumor uptake of [18F]-FESAHA and substantially higher values in the small intestine, kidneys, liver and bone.The significant non-tumor background uptake of [18F]-FESAHA presents a substantial obstacle to the use of the radiotracer as an HDAC expression imaging agent.

Tumor-targeting properties of 111In-ABY-003 were evaluated in mice bearing HER2-expressing xenografts.The dissociation constant of ABY-003 was in the low picomolar range, slightly higher than for ABY-002. 111In-ABY-003 bound specifically to HER2-expressing cells in vitro. The cellular retention was efficient but slightly worse than for 111In-ABY-002. In normal mice, the clearance of 111In-ABY-003 from blood and other tissues was slightly but significantly faster compared to 111In-ABY-002.

The effects on radiofolate biodistribution with coadministered renal uptake-blocking amino acids, diuretic agents, antifolates as well as different routes of administration were likewise investigated. Supportive imaging studies were performed using a small-animal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/CT scanner.67Ga-DOTA-Bz-EDA-folate showed a high and specific accumulation in tumors (6.30%\u00b10.75% ID/g, 1 h pi and 6.08%\u00b10.89% ID/g, 4 h pi). Nonspecific radioactivity uptake in nontargeted tissues was negligible, but significant accumulation was found in FR-positive kidneys, which resulted in unfavorably low tumor-to-kidney ratios (<0.1). Coadministered amino acids or diuretics did not effectively reduce renal accumulation; in contrast, predosed pemetrexed did significantly reduce kidney uptake (<29% of control values). The SPECT/CT studies confirmed the excellent tumor-to-background contrast of 67Ga-radiofolate and the favorable reduction in kidney uptake (with improved imaging quality) resulting from pemetrexed administration.Conventional methods to reduce kidney uptake of radiofolates fail. However, the novel 67Ga-radiolabeled DOTA-Bz-EDA-folate can effectively be used to image FR-positive cancer and potentially inflammatory diseases. Due to its rapid blood clearance properties, this tracer is also a promising candidate for positron emission tomography imaging if radiolabeled with the short-lived [68Ga]-gallium radionuclide.",

Micro-positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging was carried out for [11C]6 in a control and a cyclosporin A pretreated rat.All four compounds showed low brain uptake in control rats at 5 and 30 min post-injection; despite recently reported rat behavioral studies conducted on analogs 6 (WC-10) and 7 (WC-44).

An increase in brain uptake following modulation/inhibition of the ABC transporters was also observed in the microPET study.These data suggest that D3 selective conformationally-flexible benzamide analogs which contain a N-2-methoxyphenylpiperazine moiety are substrates for P-glycoprotein or other adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters expressed at the blood-brain barrier, and that PET radiotracers containing this pharmacophore may display low brain uptake in rodents due to the action of these efflux transporters.",

There was a significant correlation of altropane ratios with the cylinder test and the postural instability test, but not with amphetamine rotations. The low coefficient of determination (r2) for these correlations indicated that [123I]altropane SPECT was not a good predictor of behavioural outcomes.Our data reveal that [123I]altropane predicts the integrity of the striatal dopamine nerve terminals, but does not predict the integrity of the nigrostriatal system. [123I]altropane could be a useful marker to measure dopamine content in cell replacement therapies; however, it would not be able to evaluate outcomes for neuroprotective strategies.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the biodistribution and localization of an anti-inflammatory nonapeptide coupled to synovial targeting peptide (HAP-1) in rat adjuvant-induced arthritis.N\u03b5-functionalized histidine derivative was coupled to the N-terminus of core peptide (CP) and HAP-1 to allow coupling of 99mTc-tricarbonyl linker (Isolink). Synovial homing peptide HAP-1 was linked to CP through a peptide bond prior to labeling with 99mTc. Peptides were purified by high-performance liquid chromatography, characterized by mass spectrometry, radiolabeled and injected into normal and arthritic rats to determine biodistribution and localization.Gamma scintigraphy imaging showed that the biodistribution of all 99mTc-labeled peptides were higher in the arthritic joints compared with the normal nonarthritic joints, at all three time points (10 min, 1 h, 3 h postinjection) and attributed to increased blood flow to inflammatory sites. HAP-1 and CP\u2013HAP-1 showed a greater uptake and localization to arthritic joints compared with controls. There was no difference in the physiological biodistribution of these agents in the heart, kidneys and the bladder.This study highlights the versatility of using the His derivative linker for 99mTc tagging of a variety of peptides. It also demonstrates greater peptide localization and thereby bioavailability of therapeutic peptides to inflamed joints following specific conjugation to homing peptides. The ability to localize peptide/drugs to inflamed synovium has important therapeutic implications.",

Since the therapeutic effects of radioiodine therapy or prodrug chemotherapy on cancers following NIS or HSV-TK gene transfer need to be enhanced, this study was designed to investigate the feasibility of radiochemotherapy for hepatocarcinoma via coexpression of NIS gene and HSV-TK gene.HepG2 cells were stably transfected with NIS, TK and GFP gene via recombinant lentiviral vector and named HepG2/NTG. Gene expression was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence imaging and iodide uptake. The therapeutic effects were assessed by MTT assay and clonogenic assay.HepG2/NTG cells concentrated 125I\u2212 up to 76-fold higher than the wild-type cells within 20 min, and the efflux happened with a T1/2eff of less than 10 min. The iodide uptake in HepG2/NTG cells was specifically inhibited by sodium perchlorate. Dose-dependent toxicity to HepG2/NTG cells by either GCV or 131I was revealed by clonogenic assay and MTT assay, respectively. The survival rate of HepG2/NTG cells decreased to 49.7%\u00b12.5%, 43.4%\u00b12.8% and 8.6%\u00b11.2% after exposure to 131I, GCV and combined therapy, respectively.We demonstrate that radiochemotherapy of hepatocarcinoma via lentiviral-mediated coexpression of NIS gene and HSV-TK gene leads to stronger killing effect than single treatment, and in vivo studies are needed to verify these findings.",

     "abstract": "Malignant gliomas represent a major therapeutic challenge because no efficient treatment is currently available. p-[131I]iodo-l-phenylalanine ([131I]IPA) is a glioma avid radiopharmaceutical that demonstrated antiproliferative and tumoricidal effects in gliomas. The present study validated the therapeutic efficiency of [131I]IPA combined with external beam radiotherapy in experimental gliomas.Glioma cells derived from the primary human A1207, T5135, Tx3868 and M059K glioblastoma cell lines or rat F98 glioma cell line were treated with various doses of [131I]IPA, external photon irradiation (RT) or combined [131I]IPA/RT treatment. Responsiveness of glioma cells to the different therapy modalities was investigated at 24, 48 and 72 h after treatments by trypan blue, WST-1 assay, propidium iodide and bisbenzimide staining as well as by clonogenic assay. In addition, the therapy-induced DNA damage and repair were evaluated using phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX). In vivo, the effectiveness of the combination treatment was validated in human Tx3868 and A1207 glioblastoma xenografts in CD1 nu/nu mice and RNU rats.In vitro, the combination treatment resulted in a greater than additive increase in cytotoxic effect in glioma cell lines. Cell survival rate following a treatment with 1.0 \u03bcCi (37 kBq) of [131I]IPA amounted to 70%\u00b115% and 60%\u00b110% after 48 and 72 h, respectively, and decreased under 20% after additional RT with 5 Gy. At higher RT doses, cell survival rate decreased below 5%. As a measure of DNA double-strand break, nuclear \u03b3-H2AX foci were determined as a function of time. Within 24 h, the number of \u03b3-H2AX foci per cell was significantly greater after combined modality compared with the individual treatments. In vivo, when combined with RT, the radionuclide therapy with [131I]IPA resulted in an extended tumor growth delay, a reduction of the initial tumor volume and an enhanced radiosensitivity in Tx3868 and A1207 glioblastoma xenografts in CD1 nu/nu mice and RNU rats. On day 90 after monotherapy with [131I]IPA (20 MBq) or RT (20 Gy), 35%\u201350% of the treated rats were still alive. In comparison, up to 70%\u201380% survival rates were registered after combined [131I]IPA/RT treatment on day 100 for all animal models.These preclinical data convincingly demonstrated that [131I]IPA plus external beam photon radiotherapy is a safe and highly effective treatment for experimental gliomas, which may merit a clinical trial to ascertain its potential as a therapeutic approach in patients. As only a low [131I]IPA activity and a low RT dose were applied, further optimization strategies should be pursued experimentally, including application of higher radiation doses and conventional fractionated regimens or use of methods aiming to increase target doses and maximize dose effects.",

     "abstract": "Several clinical studies have shown low or no expression of GLUT1 in breast cancer patients, which may account for the low clinical specificity and sensitivity of 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) used in positron emission tomography (PET). Therefore, it has been proposed that other tumor characteristics such as the high expression of GLUT2 and GLUT5 in many breast tumors could be used to develop alternative strategies to detect breast cancer. Here we have studied the in vitro and in vivo radiopharmacological profile of 6-deoxy-6-[18F]fluoro-d-fructose (6-[18F]FDF) as a potential PET radiotracer to image GLUT5 expression in breast cancers.Uptake of 6-[18F]FDF was studied in murine EMT-6 and human MCF-7 breast cancer cells over 60 min and compared to [18F]FDG. Biodistribution of 6-[18F]FDF was determined in BALB/c mice. Tumor uptake was studied with dynamic small animal PET in EMT-6 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice and human xenograft MCF-7 tumor-bearing NIH-III mice in comparison to [18F]FDG. 6-[18F]FDF metabolism was investigated in mouse blood and urine.6-[18F]FDF is taken up by EMT-6 and MCF-7 breast tumor cells independent of extracellular glucose levels but dependent on the extracellular concentration of fructose. After 60 min, 30\u00b14% (n=9) and 12\u00b11% (n=7) ID/mg protein 6-[18F]FDF was found in EMT-6 and MCF-7 cells, respectively. 6-deoxy-6-fluoro-d-fructose had a 10-fold higher potency than fructose to inhibit 6-[18F]FDF uptake into EMT-6 cells. Biodistribution in normal mice revealed radioactivity uptake in bone and brain. Radioactivity was accumulated in EMT-6 tumors reaching 3.65\u00b10.30% ID/g (n=3) at 5 min post injection and decreasing to 1.75\u00b10.03% ID/g (n=3) at 120 min post injection. Dynamic small animal PET showed significantly lower radioactivity uptake after 15 min post injection in MCF-7 tumors [standard uptake value (SUV)=0.76\u00b10.05; n=3] compared to EMT-6 tumors (SUV=1.23\u00b10.09; n=3). Interestingly, [18F]FDG uptake was significantly different in MCF-7 tumors (SUV15 min 0.74\u00b10.12 to SUV120 min 0.80\u00b10.15; n=3) versus EMT-6 tumors (SUV15 min 1.01\u00b10.33 to SUV120 min 1.80\u00b10.25; n=3). 6-[18F]FDF was shown to be a substrate for recombinant human ketohexokinase, and it was metabolized rapidly in vivo.Based on the GLUT5 specific transport and phosphorylation by ketohexokinase, 6-[18F]FDF may represent a novel radiotracer for PET imaging of GLUT5 and ketohexokinase-expressing tumors.",

In this study, we present the preparation of FDGal with high radiochemical purity and in amounts sufficient for clinical investigations from commercially available Talose triflate (1,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-2-O-trifluoromethanesulfonyl-\u03b2-d-talopyranose). In addition, the biodistribution of FDGal in the pig is presented.FDGal was prepared by nucleophilic fluorination of Talose triflate followed by basic hydrolysis. The entire synthesis was performed using the GE TRACERlab MX 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose (FDG) synthesizer and existing methods for quality control of FDG were applied. Biodistribution of FDGal was studied by successive whole-body PET recordings of two anaesthetized 37-kg pigs.Up to 3.7 GBq sterile, pyrogen-free and no-carrier-added FDGal was produced with a radiochemical yield of 3.8\u00b11.2% and a radiochemical purity of 98\u00b11% (42 productions; yield is decay corrected). The adopted quality control methods for FDG were directly applicable for FDGal. Biodistribution studies in the pig revealed the liver and the urinary bladder as critical organs in terms of radiation dose.Commercially available Talose triflate is a suitable starting material for routine productions of FDGal. The presented radiosynthesis and quality control methods allow for the production of pure, no-carrier-added FDGal in sufficient amounts for clinical PET-investigations of the liver.",

Subjects were injected with 5 mCi of 18FLT prior to a planned surgery and then scanned on a GE Discovery-ST PET/CT scanner within an hour of injection. Regions of interest in tumor and control tissue were identified on the diagnostic CT scans and marked for later surgical biopsy. Surgery was performed within 2 days after the scan. At the time of surgery, the regions of interest identified on PET/CT were available to guide the surgeon to the tumor biopsy sites. Tissue from normal ovarian tissue control regions was also sampled. 18FLT uptake in tumor and control tissue regions was calculated by measuring the maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax). The excised tumor and normal ovarian tissue control tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining for Ki67 and CD34.

The binding affinity of ([18F]FBA)-FALGEA-NH2 was measured on EGFRvIII expressing cells, NR6M. Stability studies in vitro and in vivo were carried out in blood plasma from nude mice. PET investigations of [18F]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 were performed on a MicroPET scanner, using seven nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumours, expressing the EGFRvIII in its native form, and five nude mice xenografted subcutaneously with GBM tumours lacking EGFRvIII expression. Images of [18F]FDG were also obtained for comparison. The mice were injected with 5\u201310 MBq of the radiolabelled peptide or [18F]FDG. Furthermore, the gene expression of EGFRvIII in the tumours was determined using quantitative real-time PCR.Radiolabelling and purification was achieved within 180 min, with overall radiochemical yields of 2.6\u20139.8% (decay-corrected) and an average specific radioactivity of 6.4 GBq/\u03bcmol. The binding affinity (Kd) of [18F]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 to EGFRvIII expressing cells was determined to be 23 nM. The radiolabelled peptide was moderately stable in the plasma from nude mice where 53% of the peptide was intact after 60 min of incubation in plasma but rapidly degraded in vivo, where no intact peptide was observed in plasma 5 min post-injection.The PET imaging showed that [18F]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 accumulated preferentially in the human GBM xenografts which expressed high amounts of the mutated receptor. The average tumour-to-muscle ratio (T/M) in the EGFRvIII tumours was 7.8 at 60 min post-injection, compared with 4.6 in the wild-type EGFR tumours. Furthermore, there was a strong correlation (R=0.86, P=.007) between the expression of EGFRvIII in the tumours and the tracer uptake expressed as T/M.Our results indicate that, despite its rapid metabolism, [18F]FBA-FALGEA-NH2 binds preferentially to EGFRvIII in the tumours in vivo and is a promising lead for further development of EGFRvIII specific peptide radiopharmaceuticals.",

Dynamic PET scans in conscious monkeys were performed with/without selective GlyT-1 inhibitors.The IC50 values of SA1, SA2 and SA3 were 9.0, 6400 and 39.7 nM, respectively. The regional brain uptakes of [11C]SA1 and [11C]SA3 in mice were heterogeneous and consistent with the known distribution of GlyT-1. [11C]SA2 showed low and homogeneous uptake in the brain. Most radioactivity in the brain was detected in unchanged form, although peripherally these compounds were degraded. Carrier loading decreased the uptake of [11C]SA1 in GlyT-1-rich regions. However, similar reductions were not observed with [11C]SA3. Pretreatment with ALX-5407 decreased the uptake of [11C]SA1 in GlyT-1-rich regions. In the monkey at baseline, regional brain uptake of [11C]SA1 was heterogeneous and consistent with the known GlyT-1 distribution. Pretreatment with selective GlyT-1 inhibitors significantly decreased the distribution volume ratio of [11C] SA1 in GlyT-1-rich regions.[11C]SA1 has the most suitable profile among the three carbon-11-labelled GlyT-1 inhibitors. Lead optimization of [11C]SA1 structure will be required to achieve in vivo selective GlyT-1 imaging.",

Our aim was to evaluate a novel positron emission tomography (PET) probe, 64Cu-cyclam-RAFT-c(-RGDfK-)4, for noninvasive visualization and quantification of \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin expression.RAFT-c(-RGDfK-)4, a tetrameric cyclic Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-based peptide, was conjugated with a bifunctional chelator, 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam), radiolabeled with the positron emitter 64Cu and evaluated in vitro by cell binding and competitive inhibition assays and in vivo by biodistribution and receptor blocking studies, and PET imaging. The following cell lines, human embryonic kidney HEK293(\u03b21) [\u03b1V\u03b23-negative] and HEK293(\u03b23) [\u03b1V\u03b23-overexpressing] and human glioblastoma U87MG [naturally expressing \u03b1V\u03b23], together with their subcutaneous xenografts in athymic nude mice, were used for the present study. The expression levels of \u03b1V\u03b23 on these cell lines and tumor xenografts were analyzed by flow cytometry and sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/autoradiography, respectively.64Cu-cyclam-RAFT-c(-RGDfK-)4 demonstrated the in vitro and in vivo specificity for the \u03b1V\u03b23 integrin and displayed rapid blood clearance, predominantly renal excretion and low uptake in nontumor tissues. Tumor uptake of 64Cu-cyclam-RAFT-c(-RGDfK-)4 (3 h postinjection) in HEK293(\u03b23) (high levels of \u03b1V\u03b23), U87MG (moderate levels of \u03b1V\u03b23) and HEK293(\u03b21) (undetectable levels of \u03b1V\u03b23) tumors was 9.35%\u00b11.19%, 3.46%\u00b10.45% and 1.18%\u00b10.30% injected dose per gram, respectively, with a strong and positive correlation with the tumor \u03b1V\u03b23 expression levels (correlation coefficient=0.967; P<.0001). Positron emission tomographic images showed that \u03b1V\u03b23-positive tumors were clearly visualized with high tumor-to-background contrast, and agreed well with the biodistribution results.64Cu-cyclam-RAFT-c(-RGDfK-)4 exhibits potential for noninvasively quantifying \u03b1V\u03b23 expression.",

In the present study, we automated the synthesis of 2-[18F]fluoro-CP-118,954 for the routine use and evaluated the radioligand by microPET and ex vivo Cerenkov luminescence imaging of mouse AChE. 4-[18F]Fluoro-donepezil, another AChE inhibitor, was used for comparison. Automated syntheses of 2-[18F]fluoro-CP-118,954 and 4-[18F]fluoro-donepezil resulted in high radiochemical yields (25\u201333% and 30\u201340%) and high specific activity (27.1\u201335.4 and 29.7\u201337.3 GBq/\u03bcmol). Brain microPET images of two ICR mice injected with 2-[18F]fluoro-CP-118,954 demonstrated high uptake in the striatum (ROI analysis: 5.1 %ID/g for the first 30 min and 4.1 %ID/g for another 30 min), and a blocking study with injection of CP-118,954 into one of the mice at 30 min after radioligand injection led to complete blocking of radioligand uptake in the striatum (ROI analysis: 1.9 %ID/g), whereas 18F-labeled donepezil did not show specific uptake in the striatum. In another set of experiments, the brain tissues (striatum, parietal cortex, frontal cortex and cerebellum) were excised after brain microPET/CT imaging of mouse injected with 2-[18F]fluoro-CP-118,954, and a high striatal uptake was also detected in ex vivo optical and microPET images (ROI analysis: 1.4 %ID/g) and in \u03b3-counting data (2.1 %ID/g at 50 min post-injection) of the brain tissues.

The in vitro stability in phosphate buffered saline, mouse serum and cysteine solutions at physiological temperature and pH for all seven 99mTc-cyclized peptides was determined by radio-RP-HPLC and radio-TLC. Normal CF-1 mouse biodistribution studies were performed for three of the 99mTc-cyclized peptides.Based on the fully characterized Re-cyclized peptide analogues, four 99mTc-coordination motifs were proposed for the 99mTc-cyclized peptides. Technetium-99m-cyclized Tyr3-octreotate derivatives with N2S2 metal coordination modes and large metal ring sizes were susceptible to oxidation and loss of 99mTc in the form of 99mTcO4\u2212, as evidenced by their instability in the various solutions under physiological conditions (15\u201358% intact at 24 h). As anticipated, the addition of a third cysteine to the sequence stabilized the 99mTc metal coordination, and peptides with NS3 coordination modes remained >85% intact out to 24 h. No significant differences were observed in the biodistribution studies performed with three peptides of varying stabilities.Improvements in stability were not sufficient to outweigh the low somatostatin receptor affinity for the peptides in this study. Further improvements in the peptide sequence and/or metal coordination are needed to result in a radiodiagnostic/radiotherapeutic pair for targeting the somatostatin receptor.",

In vitro and in vivo evaluations of these complexes have been done to explore the effect of coligands on the stable, affinity and pharmacokinetic properties.A novel folate conjugate, HYNIC-NHHN-FA, was synthesized and characterized. This conjugate was radiolabeled with 99mTc using tricine, tricine /diphenylphosphinobenzene-3-sulfonic acid sodium (TPPMS) and tricine /trisodium triphenylphosphine-3,3\u2032,3\u2033-trisulfonate (TPPTS) as coligands, respectively.

In vitro and in vivo evaluations were performed with FR-positive KB cells, normal Kunming mice and athymic nude mice bearing KB tumors.Labeling with 99mTc using different coligands resulted in three complexes, 99mTc (HYNIC-NHHN-FA)(tricine), 5, 99mTc (HYNIC-NHHN-FA)(tricine/TPPMS), 6 and 99mTc (HYNIC-NHHN-FA)(tricine/TPPTS), 7. Complex 5 showed at least two isomers and was unstable after being purified by HPLC. Complexes 6 and 7 displayed high stability and similar affinity to FR in vitro. Biodistribution results in athymic nude mice bearing KB tumor showed that complex 7 had a high uptake in FR-positive tumor (9.79\u00b11.66%ID/g at 4 h postinjection), and the results of blockade studies confirmed the specific accumulation of the radiotracer in vivo.

The binding of 99mTc-His10-annexin V to apoptosis was validated in vitro using camptothecin-induced Jurkat cells. In vivo biodistribution was determined in mice by the dissection method. Ischemia of 20\u201330 min was induced by balloon occlusion of the epicardial coronary artery of the porcine model (n=14). Adenosine was infused intravenously in six pigs before coronary occlusion. 99mTc-His10-annexin V (n=12) was injected intravenously at 1 h after reperfusion. SPECT/CT was acquired at 3 h postinjection. Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with 99mTc-MIBI was also performed 1 day after His10-annexin V imaging. Cardiac tissues were analyzed postmortem using hematoxylin-and-eosin and TUNEL staining. Caspase-3 activity was measured to confirm the presence of apoptosis.99mTc-His10-annexin V had a RCP >98% and high stability 2 h after radiolabeling; it could bind to apoptotic cells with high affinity. Biodistribution of 99mTc-His10-annexin V showed a predominant uptake in the kidney and relatively low uptake in the myocardium, liver and gastrointestinal tract; rapid clearance from blood and kidney was observed. In the untreated group, intense uptake of His10-annexin V was visualized in the defect which was shown in MPI, whereas in the adenosine group a mild uptake of 99mTc-His10-annexin was found in the risk area which showed no defects in the 99mTc-MIBI image. TUNEL staining and activated caspase-3 confirmed the ongoing apoptosis in RI. Adenosine preconditioning significantly diminished the level of apoptosis. Uptake of His10-annexin V in RI correlated with TUNEL-positive nuclei.This study addresses the feasibility of imaging of myocardial cell death in acute ischemia and RI in pigs with 99mTc-His10-annexin V; it holds prospect for the detection of myocardial cell death in clinical practice. Adenosine preconditioning could attenuate the myocardial apoptosis; its cardioprotective effect might partially be fulfilled by suppressing the ongoing apoptosis in ischemia and reperfusion.

A reliable anion-exchange HPLC method equipped with suppressed conductivity and radioactive detectors has been developed in order to analyze the content of NaF and radiochemical purity in [18F]NaF radiopharmaceuticals. The method described for fluoride analysis uses an isocratic elution of NaF in a Hamilton anion-exchange column using a mobile phase that consists of 7.5 mM sodium carbonate and 0.018 mM potassium thiocyanate. The flow rate was 1.0 ml/min. The method was validated in accordance with several parameters, including system suitability, specificity, precision, accuracy, linearity, robustness, limit of detection and limit of quantification. The results are described as follows: (1) The system suitability includes the tailing factor, theoretical plate number and resolution, which are 1.192534, 2729.6594 and 16.7415, respectively. (2) For specificity, the solvent peak and chloride ion did not interfere with the retention time of the fluoride. (3) The percentage coefficient of variation for analysis of precision, including repeatability and intermediate precision, is less than 2.0%.

Radioiodinated Herceptin was injected into a tumor-bearing mouse, and luminescence and microPET images were obtained. The plant dipped in [32P]phosphate solution was scanned in luminescence mode. Radio-TLC plate was also imaged in the same imaging mode.Radionuclides emitting high energy \u03b2+/\u03b2\u2212 particles showed higher luminescence signals. NIH3T6.7 tumors were detected in both optical and nuclear imaging. The uptake of [32P]phosphate in plant was easily followed by luminescence imaging. Radio-TLC plate was visualized and radiochemical purity was quantified using luminescence imaging.Many radionuclides with high energetic \u03b2+ or \u03b2\u2212 particles during decay were found to be imaged in luminescence mode due mainly to Cerenkov radiation. \u2018Cerenkov imaging\u2019 provides a new optical imaging platform and an invaluable bridge between optical and nuclear imaging. New optical imaging probes could be easily prepared using well-established radioiodination methods. Cerenkov imaging will have more applications in the research field of plant science and autoradiography.",

Because abundant c-kit expression in tumors is a prerequisite for successful c-kit-targeted therapy, imaging of c-kit expression is expected to play a pivotal role in the therapeutic decision for each patient. We evaluated 64Cu-labeled Fab of anti-c-kit antibody 12A8 as a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging probe.111In- or 125I-Labeled 12A8 Fab was evaluated in vitro by cell binding, competitive inhibition and cellular internalization assays, and in vivo by biodistribution in mice bearing c-kit-expressing and -non-expressing tumors. Next, Fab fragment was labeled with the positron emitter 64Cu and evaluated by PET.Radiolabeled 12A8 Fab showed specific binding to c-kit-expressing cells with high affinity and internalized into cells after binding to c-kit on cell surface. Although tumor accumulation of [111In]Fab was lower than that of [111In]IgG, the faster blood clearance of [111In]Fab provided higher tumor-to-blood ratio at 6 h postinjection onwards. Blood clearance of 64Cu-labeled 12A8 Fab was slower than that of [111In]Fab, but PET using [64Cu]Fab clearly visualized the tumor at 6 h postinjection onwards.The 64Cu-labeled 12A8 Fab could be used for c-kit-specific PET imaging and might help in selecting appropriate patients for c-kit-targeted treatments.",

Here, the effect of treatment with growth-inhibitory doses of the anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) on the incorporation of FDG by breast tumor cells was measured along with hexokinase (HK) and glucose transport to determine the potential of FDG-positron emission tomography in predicting response to these biological anti-cancer therapies and their modulatory effects on the steps involved in FDG incorporation.The sensitivity to trastuzumab of three breast tumor cell lines, SKBr3, MDA-MB-453 and MDA-MB-468, expressing human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 at high, medium and low levels, respectively, was determined using MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assay over a 6-day period, and a clonogenic assay was carried out after 7- and 10-day exposures. FDG incorporation by cells treated with growth-inhibitory doses of trastuzumab was carried out after 4 h and 2, 4 and 6 days of treatment. Glucose transport (rate of uptake of the non-metabolizable analogue [3H]O-methyl-d-glucose), HK activity and lactate production were measured on cells treated with inhibitory doses of trastuzumab for 6 days.The IC50 doses for SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 and the IC20 dose for MDA-MB-468 after 6 days of treatment with trastuzumab were 0.25, 1 and 170 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. FDG incorporation by SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 cells was found to be decreased using IC50 doses of trastuzumab for 6 days. At the IC50 doses, FDG incorporation was also decreased at 4 days and, in the case of MDA-MB-453, even after 4 h of treatment. Decreased FDG incorporation corresponded with decreased HK activity in these cells. Lactate production, previously suggested to be a potential measure of response, was found to be significantly decreased by SKBr3 and MDA-MB-453 cells responding to trastuzumab.FDG incorporation at the tumor cell level is modulated by treatment with growth-inhibitory doses of trastuzumab due to modulation of HK activity. Changes in lactate production may also be a useful determinant of response to trastuzumab.",

     "abstract": "In FDG-PET for abdominal malignancy, the liver may be assumed as an internal standard for grading abnormal FDG uptake both in early images and in delayed images. However, physiological variables of FDG uptake by the liver, especially the effects of blood glucose level, have not yet been elucidated.FDG-PET studies of 70 patients examined at 50 to 70 min after injection (60\u00b110 min: early images) and of 68 patients examined at 80 to 100 min after injection (90\u00b110 min: delayed images) were analyzed for liver FDG uptake. Patients having lesions in the liver, spleen and pancreas; patients having bulk tumor in other areas; and patients early after chemotherapy or radiotherapy were excluded; also, patients with blood glucose level over 125 mg/dl were excluded.Mean standardized uptake value (SUV) of the liver, blood glucose level and sex showed no significant differences between early images and delayed images. However, liver SUV in the delayed image showed a larger variation than that in the early image and showed significant correlation to blood glucose level. The partial correlation coefficient between liver SUV and blood glucose level in the delayed image with adjustment for sex and age was 0.73 (P<.0001). Multivariate regression coefficient (95% confidence interval) of blood glucose was 0.017 (0.013\u20130.021).Blood glucose level is an important factor affecting the normal liver FDG uptake in nondiabetic patients. In the case of higher glucose level, liver FDG uptake is elevated especially in the delayed image. This may be due to the fact that the liver is the key organ responsible for glucose metabolism through gluconeogenesis and glycogen storage.",

Its variability can be affected by changes of the amount of excreted FDG by renal function. Moreover, the estimation of SUV is quite sensitive to errors in the measurements of body weight and injected dose. This study aims to develop an image-based method to obtain an image-derived SUV (iSUV) and a modified SUV (mSUV) to overcome these problems.Thirty-one tumor-planted SCID mice were scanned in micro-positron emission tomography (PET) at \u223c60 min post FDG injection and then scanned in micro-computed tomographic (CT). Using image-based method, the body weight and injected dose were derived from the microPET/CT images to calculate iSUV. The volumes and the total activities of FDG within the bladder and the whole-body were also obtained to calculate mSUV. For the selected targets, the iSUVs and mSUVs were compared against their corresponding SUVs.Compared with SUV factor (injected dose/body weight), iSUV factor had an average percentage error of \u22120.7%. The linear regressions between SUV and iSUV had a slope of 0.99 with correlation coefficient of 0.95. Compared with SUV and iSUV, coefficient of variation of mSUV decreased while the tumor-to-background separation of mSUV increased.Using this image-based method, the iSUV can replace SUV when the actual measurements were missing or unreliable. The mSUV can reduce the inter-subject variability and enhance the tumor-to-background separation in mouse FDG-PET studies.",

Furthermore, the development of the beta probe and the requirement for better image resolution have increased the need for a positron-emitting SLN imaging agent. Here, we describe the development of a novel positron-emitting SLN imaging agent labeled with 68Ga.A mannosylated human serum albumin (MSA) was synthesized by conjugating \u03b1-d-mannopyranosylphenyl isothiocyanate to human serum albumin in sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.5), and then 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid was conjugated to synthesize NOTA-MSA. Numbers of mannose and NOTA units conjugated in NOTA-MSA were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. NOTA-MSA was labeled with 68Ga at room temperature. The stability of 68Ga-NOTA-MSA was checked in labeling medium at room temperature and in human serum at 37\u00b0C. Biodistribution in normal ICR mice was investigated after tail vein injection, and micro-positron emission tomography (PET) images were obtained after injecting 68Ga-NOTA-MSA into a tail vein or a footpad.The numbers of conjugated \u03b1-d-mannopyranosylphenyl isothiocyanate and 2-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)-1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid units in NOTA-MSA were 10.6 and 6.6, respectively. The labeling efficiency of 68Ga-NOTA-MSA was greater than 99% at room temperature, and its stability was greater than 99% at 4 h. Biodistribution and micro-PET studies of 68Ga-NOTA-MSA showed high liver and spleen uptakes after intravenous injection. 68Ga-NOTA-MSA injected into a footpad rapidly migrated to the lymph node.68Ga-NOTA-MSA was successfully developed as a novel SLN imaging agent for PET.

The biodistribution showed the uptake at the lesion increased with time as shown by significantly increased standard uptake values for up to 4 h post injection. There was a considerable decrease in the background activity during the same period of study, giving higher target-to-muscle ratios. Blood pool activity at 3 h post injection was insignificant. 68GaCl3 (when not conjugated to TF) did not localize at the infection lesion up to 120 min post injection.The preliminary results suggest that 68Ga-TF is capable of detecting S. aureus infection in the rat model, within an hour after intravenous injection.",

No study on preparing a complex of 177Lu with MDP has been reported yet. Based on these facts, it was hypothesized that a bone-seeking 177Lu\u2013MDP (lutetium-177-labeled MDP) radiopharmaceutical could be developed as an agent for palliative radiotherapy of bone pain due to skeletal metastases. Biodistribution studies after intravenous injection of 177Lu\u2013MDP complex in rats may yield important information to assess its potential for clinical use as a bone pain palliation agent for the treatment of bone metastases.177Lu was produced by irradiating natural Lu2O3 (10 mg) target at a thermal flux \u223c8.0\u00d71013 n/cm2 per second for 12 h in the swimming pool-type reactor.177Lu was labeled with MDP by adding nearly 37 MBq (1.0 mCi) of 177LuCl3 to a vial containing 10 mg MDP. The radiochemical purity and labeling efficiencies were determined by thin layer chromatography. Labeling of 177Lu with MDP was optimized, and one sample was subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. Twelve Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi). 177Lu\u2013MDP in a volume of 0.1 ml was injected intravenously and then sacrificed at 2 min, 1 h, 2 h and 22 h (three rats at each time point) after injection. Samples of various organs were separated, weighed and measured for radioactivity and expressed as percent uptake of injected dose per gram. Bioevaluation studies with rats under gamma-camera were also performed to verify the results.The quality control using thin layer chromatography has shown >99% radiochemical purity of 177Lu\u2013MDP complex. Chromatography with Whatman 3MM paper showed maximum labeling at pH=6, incubation time=30 min, and ligand/metal ratio=60:1.

Gamma-camera images of 177Lu\u2013MDP in Sprague-Dawley rats also showed high skeletal uptake and verified the results.The study demonstrated that MDP could be labeled with 177Lu with high radiochemical yields (>99%). The in vitro stability of the complex was found adequate.

Duration and temperatures of the [18F]fluorination reaction were varied.

     "abstract": "64Cu-diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM) is an imaging agent for positron emission tomography (PET) that targets hypoxic tumors. 64Cu-ATSM is also reported to be a potential agent for internal radiotherapy. In a mouse colon carcinoma (Colon-26) model, we have shown that 64Cu-ATSM preferentially localizes in intratumoral regions with a high density of CD133+ cells, which show characteristics of cancer stem cells or cancer stem cell-like cells (collectively referred here as CSCs). In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of 64Cu-ATSM in relation to CD133 expression using this model.Systemic administration of 37 MBq 64Cu-ATSM or saline was conducted twice within a 1-week interval to mice bearing 1-week-old Colon-26 tumors (days 0\u20137). At day 19, tumor size measurement, flow cytometry analysis and experimental lung metastatic assay were performed. The therapeutic effect of 64Cu-ATSM on sorted CD133+ and CD133\u2212 Colon-26 cells was also examined in vitro.In vivo studies showed that 64Cu-ATSM treatment inhibited tumor growth. The percentage of CD133+ cells and metastatic ability in 64Cu-ATSM treated tumors was decreased compared with that in control animals. In vitro studies demonstrated that 64Cu-ATSM accumulated in cells under hypoxic conditions and incorporation of 64Cu-ATSM under hypoxia caused cell death in both CD133+ and CD133\u2212 cells in a similar extent.64Cu-ATSM administration reduced tumor volume as well as the percentage of CD133+ cells and the metastatic ability of Colon-26 tumors. Together with our data, it is suggested that 64Cu-ATSM accumulates in regions high in CD133+ highly tumorigenic cells and kills such regions by radiation, resulting in a decrease of the percentage of CD133+ cells.",

     "abstract": "In connection with pretargeting, an amine-derivatized morpholino phosphorodiamidate oligomer (NH2-cMORF) was conjugated conventionally with p-isothiocyanate benzyl-DTPA (p-SCN-Bn-DTPA). However, after 111In radiolabeling, unexpected label instability was observed. To understand this instability, the NH2-cMORF and, as control, the native cMORF without the amine were conjugated in the conventional manner. Surprisingly, the 111In labeling of the native cMORF conjugate was equally effective as that of the NH2-cMORF conjugate (>95%) despite the absence of the amine group. Furthermore, heating the radiolabeled NH2-cMORF and native cMORF conjugates resulted in a 35% loss and a complete loss of the label, respectively. Since the 111In labeled DTPA is known to be stable, the instability in both cases must be due to some unstable association of DTPA to the cMORF, presumably unstable association to some endogenous sites in cMORF. Based on this assumption, a postconjugation\u2013prepurification heating step was introduced, and labeling efficiency and stability were again investigated. By introducing the heating step, the side products were dissociated, and after purification and labeling, the NH2-cMORF conjugate provided a stable label and high labeling efficiency with no need for postlabeling purification. The biodistribution of this radiolabeled conjugate in normal mice showed significantly lower backgrounds compared with the labeled unstable native cMORF conjugate. In conclusion, the conventional conjugation procedure to attach the p-SCN-Bn-DTPA to NH2-cMORF resulted in side product(s) that were responsible for the 111In label instability. Adding a postconjugation\u2013prepurification heating step dissociated the side products, improved the label stability and lowered tissue backgrounds in mice.",

[18F]FECH is actively transported into mammalian cells, becomes phosphorylated by choline kinase and gets incorporated into the cell membrane after being metabolized to phosphatidylcholine. So far, its synthesis is a two-step procedure involving at least one HPLC purification step. To allow a wider dissemination of this tracer, finding a purification method avoiding HPLC is highly desirable and would result in easier accessibility and more reliable production of [18F]FECH.[18F]FECH was synthesized by reaction of 2-bromo-1-[18F]fluoroethane ([18F]BFE) with dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE) in DMSO. We applied a novel and very reliable work-up procedure for the synthesis of [18F]BFE. Based on a combination of three different solid-phase cartridges, the purification of [18F]BFE from its precursor 2-bromoethyl-4-nitrobenzenesulfonate (BENos) could be achieved without using HPLC. Following the subsequent reaction of the purified [18F]BFE with DMAE, the final product [18F]FECH was obtained as a sterile solution by passing the crude reaction mixture through a combination of two CM plus cartridges and a sterile filter. The fully automated synthesis was performed using as well a Raytest SynChrom module (Raytest, Germany) or a Scintomics HotboxIII module (Scintomics, Germany).The radiotracer [18F]FECH can be synthesized in reliable radiochemical yields (RCY) of 37\u00b15% (Synchrom module) and 33\u00b15% (Hotbox III unit) in less than 1 h using these two fully automated commercially available synthesis units without HPLC involvement for purification. Detailed quality control of the final injectable [18F]FECH solution proved the high radiochemical purity and the absence of Kryptofix2.2.2, DMAE and DMSO used in the course of synthesis. Sterility and bacterial endotoxin testing following standard procedures verified that the described production method for [18F]FECH is suitable for human applications.The routine production of [18F]FECH with sufficient RCYs was established by reliable and fast solid-phase extraction purifications of both the secondary labeling precursor [18F]BFE and the final product [18F]FECH, avoiding complex and sensitive HPLC equipment. The purity of the product was >95%, rendering the tracer suitable for human application. The newly developed purification procedure for [18F]BFE significantly reduces the complexity of the automated synthesis unit, hence reducing the cost for routine production in a clinical setup and allowing easy transfer to different synthesis modules.",

Additionally, we attempted to characterize the main serum enzymatic cleavage sites by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) analysis.In vitro stability of a DOTA-minigastrin derivative (177Lu-DOTA-His-His-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-NIe-Asp-Phe-NH2) was tested in serum, rat tissue homogenates and two different standardised enzymatic mixtures. Quantification of the metabolised radiopeptides at different time intervals was performed using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Metabolites were characterised by MALDI-TOF-MS. Urine was collected after 15 min p.i. into the mice and compared with in vitro metabolites by RP-HPLC.Faster degradation of the radiopeptide was found in blood in comparison with plasma and serum incubation and in components from rats faster than from human origin. Fast degradation was observed in kidney and liver homogenates as well as in standardised enzymatic mixtures, also revealing variations in the metabolic profile. In urine, no intact peptide was detected already 5 min post injection. MALDI-TOF-MS revealed major cleavage sites at the carboxy terminus of the peptide.Very variable results may be found when different kind of incubation media for testing radiopeptide stabilities is used.

     "abstract": "PET imaging in plants is receiving increased interest as a new strategy to measure plant responses to environmental stimuli and as a tool for phenotyping genetically engineered plants. PET imaging in plants, however, poses new challenges. In particular, the leaves of most plants are so thin that a large fraction of positrons emitted from PET isotopes (18F, 11C, 13N) escape while even state-of-the-art PET cameras have significant partial-volume errors for such thin objects. Although these limitations are acknowledged by researchers, little data have been published on them.Here we measured the magnitude and distribution of escaping positrons from the leaf of Nicotiana tabacum for the radionuclides 18F, 11C and 13N using a commercial small-animal PET scanner. Imaging results were compared to radionuclide concentrations measured from dissection and counting and to a Monte Carlo simulation using GATE (Geant4 Application for Tomographic Emission).Simulated and experimentally determined escape fractions were consistent. The fractions of positrons (mean\u00b1S.D.) escaping the leaf parenchyma were measured to be 59\u00b11.1%, 64\u00b14.4% and 67\u00b11.9% for 18F, 11C and 13N, respectively. Escape fractions were lower in thicker leaf areas like the midrib. Partial-volume averaging underestimated activity concentrations in the leaf blade by a factor of 10 to 15.The foregoing effects combine to yield PET images whose contrast does not reflect the actual activity concentrations. These errors can be largely corrected by integrating activity along the PET axis perpendicular to the leaf surface, including detection of escaped positrons, and calculating concentration using a measured leaf thickness.",

Previous studies in non-human primates demonstrated favorable properties of [11C]GR103545 as a positron emission tomography tracer for in vivo imaging of cerebral kappa-opioid receptor. Nonetheless, advancement of [11C]GR103545 to imaging studies in humans was hampered by difficulties of its multiple-step radiosynthesis, which produces a final product with low specific activity (SA), which in turn could induce undesirable physiological side effects resulting from the mass associated with an injected amount of radioactivity. We report herein an alternative radiosynthesis of [11C]GR103545 with higher SA and radiochemical yields.The TRACERLab FXC automated synthesis module was used to carry out the two-step, one-pot procedure. In the first step, the desmethoxycarbonyl precursor was converted to the carbamic acid intermediate desmethyl-GR103545 via transcarboxylation with the zwitterionic carbamic complex, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene\u2013carbon dioxide, in the presence and/or absence of cesium carbonate and tetrabutylammonium triflate.

Motivated by model predictions, we used directed evolution and yeast surface display to affinity mature the 2D12.5 antibody to DOTA, reformatted as a single chain variable fragment (scFv).Modeling predicts that for high antigen density and saturating bsAb dose, a hapten-binding affinity of 100 pM is needed for near-maximal hapten retention.

Affinity maturation resulted in a 1000-fold affinity improvement to biotinylated DOTA-yttrium, yielding an 8.2\u00b11.9 picomolar binder. The high-affinity scFv binds DOTA complexes of lutetium and gadolinium with similar picomolar affinity and indium chelates with low nanomolar affinity.

Consequently, microfluidic technology is an ideal tool for radiolabeling reactions involving short-lived positron emitters. Optimization of the complex array of different reaction conditions requires knowledge of the different reaction parameters linked to the microfluidic system as well as their influence on the radiochemical yields. 1-(5-Deoxy-5-fluoro-\u03b1-d-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole ([18F]FAZA) is a frequently used radiotracer for PET imaging of tumor hypoxia. The present study describes the radiosynthesis of [18F]FAZA by means of microfluidic technology and subsequent small animal PET imaging in EMT-6 tumor-bearing mice.Radiosyntheses were performed using the NanoTek Microfluidic Synthesis System (Advion BioSciences, Inc.). Optimal reaction conditions were studied through screening different reaction parameters like temperature, flow rate, residency time, concentration of the labeling precursor (1-(2,3-di-O-acetyl-5-O-tosyl-\u03b1-d-arabinofuranosyl)-2-nitroimidazole) and the applied volume ratio between the labeling precursor and [18F]fluoride.Optimized reaction conditions at low radioactivity levels (1 to 50 MBq) afforded 63% (decay-corrected) of HPLC-purified [18F]FAZA within 25 min. Higher radioactivity levels (0.4 to 2.1 GBq) gave HPLC-purified [18F]FAZA in radiochemical yields of 40% (decay-corrected) within 60 min at a specific activity in the range of 70 to 150 GBq/\u03bcmol. Small animal PET studies in EMT-6 tumor-bearing mice showed radioactivity accumulation in the tumor (SUV20min 0.74 \u00b1 0.08) resulting in an increasing tumor-to-muscle ratio over time.Microfluidic technology is an ideal method for the rapid and efficient radiosynthesis of [18F]FAZA for preclinical radiopharmacological studies. Careful analysis of various reaction parameters is an important requirement for the understanding of the influence of different reaction parameters on the radiochemical yield using microfluidic technology.

     "abstract": "Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is the enzyme responsible for metabolising the endogenous cannabinoid, anandamide, and thus represents an important target for molecular imaging. To date, no radiotracer has been shown to be useful for imaging of FAAH using either positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). We here determine the suitability of a novel carbon-11-labeled inhibitor of FAAH via ex vivo biodistribution studies in rat brain in conjunction with pharmacological challenges.A potent irreversible inhibitor of FAAH, URB694, radiolabeled with carbon-11 in the carbonyl position ([11C]CURB), was administered to male rats via tail-vein injection. Rats were sacrificed at various time points postinjection, and tissue samples were dissected, counted and weighed. Specific binding to FAAH was investigated by pretreatment of animals with URB694 or URB597. For metabolism and mechanism of binding studies, whole brains were excised post-radiotracer injection, homogenised and extracted exhaustively with 80% aq. acetonitrile to determine the time course and fraction of radioactivity that was irreversibly bound to brain parenchyma.Upon intravenous injection into rats, [11C]CURB showed high brain uptake [standard uptake value (SUV) of 1.6\u20132.4 at 5 min] with little washout over time, which is characteristic of irreversible binding. Highest uptake of radioactivity was seen in the cortex, intermediate in the cerebellum and lowest in the hypothalamus, reflecting the reported distribution of FAAH. Brain uptake of radioactivity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner by pretreatment with increasing amounts of URB694, demonstrating that binding was saturable. Pretreatment with the well-characterised FAAH inhibitor, URB597, reduced binding in all brain regions by 70\u201380%. Homogenised brain extraction experiments demonstrated unequivocally that [11C]CURB was irreversibly bound to FAAH.The title radiotracer demonstrates favourable properties such as good brain uptake, regional heterogeneity and specificity of binding based on ex vivo biodistribution studies in conscious rat brain. [11C]CURB represents a highly promising radiotracer for the imaging of FAAH using PET.",

In this study, we investigate the agonist properties of CUMI-101 in rat brain tissue.[35S]-GTP\u03b3S binding studies were used to determine receptor function in HEK (human embryonic kidney) 293 cells transfected with human recombinant 5-HT1A receptors and in rat cortex and rat hippocampal tissue, following administration of CUMI-101 and standard 5-HT1A antagonists (5-HT, 5-CT and 8-OH-DPAT).CUMI-101 behaved as an agonist at human recombinant 5-HT1A receptors (pEC50 9.2). However, CUMI-101 did not show agonist activity in either rat cortex or hippocampus at concentrations up to 10 \u03bcM. In these tissues, CUMI-behaved as an antagonist with pKBs of 9.2 and 9.3, respectively.Our studies demonstrate that as opposed to its behavior in human recombinant system, in rat brain tissue CUMI-101 behaves as a potent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist.",

An important uptake in apoptotic tissues was confirmed by biodistributions, scintigraphic images and histological studies.Biodistribution studies revealed hepatobiliary elimination, high stability in vivo and important uptake in the reticuloendothelial system. In the pathologic model, higher uptake values correspond to the liver, spleen, lungs and femur.

     "abstract": "The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) mediates active iodide uptake in lactating breast tissue, and when its levels are enhanced by all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), NIS has been proposed as a target for the imaging and radiotherapy of breast cancer. Importantly, the estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) is an important regulator of atRA induced NIS gene expression in breast cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of an ER agonist (17\u03b2-estradiol, E2) or antagonist [trans-hydroxytamoxifen (TOT) or raloxifene (RAL)] treatment on the regulation of NIS gene expression and iodide uptake in an ER\u03b1-positive breast cancer (MCF-7) model.NIS functional activity was measured in vitro by 125I uptake assay after incubation with E2 (from 10\u221215 to 10\u22125 M), TOT (from 5\u00d710\u22128 to 5\u00d710\u22126 M), or RAL (from 5\u00d710\u22128 to 5\u00d710\u22126 M) in the presence or absence of atRA (10\u22127 M). Under the same conditions, NIS mRNA expression was examined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Athymic mice with MCF-7 xenograft tumors were treated with atRA alone or atRA together with E2 to evaluate the change of 125I uptake in tumor tissues in vivo.In the iodide uptake study in cells, E2, TOT, or RAL treatment alone did not stimulate 125I uptake. However, when iodide uptake was stimulated by atRA, cotreatment with E2, TOT or RAL decreased 125I uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. The hormone effects on NIS mRNA expression levels in MCF-7 cells were similar. The results of the in vivo biodistribution study showed that 125I uptake was reduced 50% in tumor tissues of mice treated with atRA/E2 as compared to tumors treated only with atRA.Our results suggest that combination treatment of atRA and ER ligands could limit the functional activity of the NIS gene induced by atRA, thereby compromising its use as a target for diagnosis or radiotherapy in breast cancer.",

Our purpose was to study glucose metabolism and blood flow in untreated localized musculoskeletal tumors of the extremities using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), oxygen-15 labeled water ([15O]H2O) and positron emission tomography (PET).Six patients with high-grade osteosarcoma (OS), two with soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) and one with aneurysmal bone cyst had PET studies with [15O]H2O and FDG. Arterial blood sampling and autoradiography calculation method were used to define blood flow as milliliters per 100 g times minutes. Tumor FDG uptake was measured as standardized uptake values (SUVs) and regional metabolic rates for FDG (rMRFDG). Two patients also had FDG PET studies during (one patient) and after (two patients) preoperative chemotherapy. All patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). The PET findings were compared with the clinical follow-up data and results of DCE-MRI.Blood flow in bone tumors was 31.7\u201375.2 ml/(100 g\u00d7min) and in STS 9.0\u201345.9 ml/(100 g\u00d7min).

[18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose uptake and rMRFDG in STS were 2.6\u201311.5 and 5.6\u201332.2 \u03bcmol/100 g/min, respectively. Four of five sarcomas with SUV>9.0 have already relapsed. High blood flow in untreated OS was related to long overall survival, while the predictive power of glucose metabolism was less apparent. Good histopathological response to therapy was not associated with long survival.Measurement of blood flow in musculoskeletal tumors appears to be feasible by PET and [15O]H2O. The influence of tumor blood flow and glucose metabolism on the final outcome in sarcoma is variable and needs further research.",

The nanoconjugate was characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), IR, UV\u2013Vis, Raman, fluorescence and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Technetium-99m labelling was carried out using EDDA/tricine as coligands and SnCl2 as reducing agent with further size-exclusion chromatography purification. Radiochemical purity was determined by size-exclusion HPLC and ITLC-SG analyses. In vitro binding studies were carried out in rat liver homogenized tissue (mannose-receptor positive tissue). Biodistribution studies were accomplished in Wistar rats and images obtained using a micro-SPECT/CT system.TEM and spectroscopy techniques demonstrated that AuNPs were functionalized with HYNIC-GGC-NH2 and thiol-mannose through interactions with thiol groups and the N-terminal amine of cysteine. Radio-chromatograms showed radiochemical purity higher than 95%. 99mTc-EDDA/HYNIC-GGC-AuNP-mannose (99mTc-AuNP-mannose) showed specific recognition for mannose receptors in rat liver tissue. After subcutaneous administration of 99mTc-AuNP-mannose in rats (footpad), radioactivity levels in the popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes revealed that 99% of the activity was extracted by the first lymph node (popliteal extraction). Biodistribution studies and in vivo micro-SPECT/CT images in Wistar rats showed an evident lymph node uptake (11.58\u00b11.98 %ID at 1 h) which was retained during 24 h with minimal kidney accumulation (0.98\u00b10.10 %ID) and negligible uptake in all other tissues.This study demonstrated that 99mTc-AuNP-mannose remains within the first lymph node during 24 h and therefore might be useful as a target-specific radionanoconjugate for SLND using \u201c1-day\u201d or \u201c2-day\u201d conventional protocols.",

Rituximab radiolabeled with \u03b2\u2212 emitters could potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of the antibody by virtue of the particle radiation. Here, we report on a direct radiolabeling approach of rituximab with the 99mTc- and 188Re-tricarbonyl core (IsoLink technology).The native format of the antibody (RTXwt) as well as a reduced form (RTXred) was labeled with 99mTc/188Re(CO)3. The partial reduction of the disulfide bonds to produce free sulfhydryl groups (\u2013SH) was achieved with 2-mercaptoethanol. Radiolabeling efficiency, in vitro human plasma stability as well as transchelation toward cysteine and histidine was investigated. The immunoreactivity and binding affinity were determined on Ramos and/or Raji cells expressing CD20. Biodistribution was performed in mice bearing subcutaneous Ramos lymphoma xenografts.The radiolabeling efficiency and kinetics of RTXred were superior to that of RTXwt (99mTc: 98% after 3 h for RTXred vs. 70% after 24 h for RTXwt). 99mTc(CO)3-RTXred was used without purification for in vitro and in vivo studies whereas 188Re(CO)3-RTXred was purified to eliminate free 188Re-precursor. Both radioimmunoconjugates were stable in human plasma for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. In contrast, displacement experiments with excess cysteine/histidine showed significant transchelation in the case of 99mTc(CO)3-RTXred but not with pre-purified 188Re(CO)3-RTXred. Both conjugates revealed high binding affinity to the CD20 antigen (Kd=5\u20136 nM). Tumor uptake of 188Re(CO)3-RTXred was 2.5 %ID/g and 0.8 %ID/g for 99mTc(CO)3-RTXred 48 h after injection. The values for other organs and tissues were similar for both compounds, for example the tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-liver ratios were 0.4 and 0.3 for 99mTc(CO)3-RTXred and for 188Re(CO)3-RTXred 0.5 and 0.5 (24 h pi).Rituximab could be directly and stably labeled with the matched pair 99mTc/188Re using the IsoLink technology under retention of the biological activity.

Biodistribution data were obtained from positron emission tomography images acquired at 1, 24 and 48 hours post-injection, and at 48 hours post-injection a full ex vivo biodistribution study was carried out.The biodistribution, including tumor targeting, was similar for all the radioimmunoconjugates. At 48 h post-injection, the only statistically significant differences in radionuclide uptake (p < 0.05) were between blood, liver, spleen and kidney. For example, liver uptake of [64Cu]ch14.18-p-NH2-Bn-NOTA was 4.74 \u00b1 0.77 per cent of the injected dose per gram of tissue (%ID/g), and for [64Cu]ch14.18-SarAr was 8.06 \u00b1 0.77 %ID/g. Differences in tumor targeting correlated with variations in tumor size rather than which BFC was used.The results of this study indicate that differences in the thermodynamic stability of these chelator-Cu(II) complexes were not associated with significant differences in uptake of the tracer by the tumor. However, there were significant differences in tracer concentration in other tissues, including those involved in clearance of the radioimmunoconjugate (e.g., liver and spleen).",

Radiosynthesis of [18F]fluoromethyl tosylate required extensive modification of the existing method. [18F]Fluorocholine and [18F]fluoro-[1,2-2H4]choline were then subjected to in vitro oxidative stability analysis in a chemical oxidation model using potassium permanganate and an enzymatic model using choline oxidase.

The ability of these radioiodinated compounds to bind to AGT was determined by a trichloroacetic acid precipitation assay and gel electrophoresis/phosphor imaging. Labeling of an AGT-AIBG conjugate via Staudinger ligation using the 131I-labeled phosphine ligand, 2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl 4-[131I]iodobenzoate, also was investigated.[131I]AHOMIBG was synthesized in two steps from its tin precursor in 52.2\u00b17.5% (n=5) radiochemical yield and conjugated to the NLS peptide via click reaction in 50.7\u00b14.9% (n=6) yield. The protected tin precursor of AIBG was radioiodinated in an average radiochemical yield of 69.6\u00b14.5% (n=7); deprotection of the intermediate gave [131I]AIBG in 17.8\u00b14.2% (n=9) yield. While both [131I]AHOMIBG and its NLS conjugate bound to AGT pure protein, their potency as a substrate for AGT was substantially lower than that of [125I]IBG. Uptake of [131I]AHOMIBG-NLS conjugate in DAOY medulloblastoma cells was up to eightfold higher than that of [125I]IBG; however, the uptake was not changed when the cellular AGT content was first depleted with BG treatment. [131I]AIBG was almost equipotent as [125I]IBG with respect to binding to pure AGT; however, attempts to radiolabel AGT by treatment with unlabeled AIBG followed by Staudinger ligation using the radiolabeled phosphine ligand, 2-(diphenylphosphino)phenyl 4-[131I]iodobenzoate were not successful.Although AHOMIBG, and AIBG were synthesized successfully in both unlabeled and radioiodinated forms, the radioiodinated compounds failed to label AGT either after NLS peptide conjugation or via Staundiger ligation. Currently, other bio-orthogonal approaches are being evaluated for labeling AGT by pretargeting.",

The human sodium/iodide symporter (hNIS) gene has been shown to be a useful molecular imaging reporter gene. Here, we investigated the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy by molecular imaging in reporter gene transfected tumor xenografts using a gamma imaging system.The hNIS gene was transfected into MDA-MB-231 cells using Lipofectamine. The correlation between the number of MDA-MB-231-hNIS cells and the uptake of 99mTc-pertechnetate or 125I was investigated in vitro by gamma imaging and counting. MDA-MB-231-hNIS cells were injected subcutaneously into mice. When the tumor volume reached 180-200 mm3, we randomly assigned five animals to each of three groups representing different tumor therapies; no DC101 (control), 100 \u03bcg, or 150 \u03bcg DC101/mouse. One week and 2 weeks after the first injection of DC101, gamma imaging was performed. Mice were sacrificed 2 weeks after the first injection of DC101. The tumor tissues were used for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and CD31 staining.Uptake of 125I and 99mTc-pertechnetate into MDA-MB-231-hNIS cells in vitro showed correlation with the number of cells. In DC101 treatment groups, the mean tumor volume was smaller than that of the control mice. Furthermore, tumor uptake of 125I was lower than in the controls. The CD31 staining and RT-PCR assay results showed that vessel formation and expression of the hNIS gene were significantly reduced in the tumor tissues of treatment groups.This study demonstrated the power of molecular imaging using a gamma imaging system for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of an antitumor treatment. Molecular imaging systems may be useful in evaluation and development of effective diagnostic and/or therapeutic antibodies for specific target molecules.",

In this study, effects of cetuximab in combination with alpha-emitting radioimmunotherapy (RIT) in a panel of cultured human squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) were assessed.SCC cell lines were characterized and treated with cetuximab in combination with anti-CD44v6 RIT using the astatinated chimeric monoclonal antibody U36 (211At-cMAb U36). Effects on 211At-cMAb U36 uptake, internalization and cell proliferation were then assessed in SCC cells.Cetuximab in combination with 211At-cMAb U36 mediated increased growth inhibition compared to RIT or cetuximab alone in two cell lines. However, cetuximab also mediated radioprotective effects compared to RIT alone in two cell lines. The radioprotective effects occurred in the cell lines in which cetuximab clearly inhibited cell growth during radiation exposure. Cetuximab treatment also influenced 211At-cMAb-U36 uptake and internalization, suggesting interactions between CD44v6 and EGFR.Results from this study demonstrate the vast importance of further clarifying the mechanisms of cetuximab and radiation response, and the relationship between EGFR and suitable RIT targets. This is important not only in order to avoid potential radioprotective effects, but also in order to find and utilize potential synergistic effects from these combinations.",

Biodistribution in healthy Swiss mice were carried out in order to evaluate the biological behaviour of the radiocomplexes.Radiochemical yields were higher than 97% and no apparent instability toward transchelant agents was observed for both radioconjugates. A higher lipophilic character was observed for the radioconjugate labeled via MAG3. The chelators seem to have no effect on the percentage of the radioconjugate bound to plasma proteins. A similar biological pattern was observed for both radioconjugates. Total blood, bone and muscle values revealed a slightly slower clearance for the radiocomplex labeled via MAG3. Moreover, a remarkable liver and intestinal uptake was observed for the radiocomplex labeled via MAG3 even at the later time points studied.The high radiochemical yields achieved and the similar in vivo pattern found for both radioconjugates make them potential candidates for imaging tumors using nuclear medicine techniques.",

This work reports new methods for the synthesis of [19F]BAY94-9172 and its two different precursors and radiosynthesis of [18F]BAY94-9172 with the two precursors by purification using Sep-Pak cartridge.The reference standard [19F]BAY94-9172 and the new precursor (Compound 9) were obtained from the reactions of (E)-4-methylamino-4\u2032-hydroxystilbene (Compound 1) with methanesulfonic acid 2-[2-(2-fluoro-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-ethyl ester (Compound 11) and methanesulfonic acid 2-[2-(2-methanesulfonyloxy-ethoxy)-ethoxy]-ethyl ester (Compound 13), respectively. The reported precursor (Compound 6) is an N-BOC-protected mesylate compound, which was obtained from Compound 9. The one-step radiosynthesis of [18F]BAY94-9172 was carried out in the modified PET-MF-2V-IT-1 synthesizer by [18F]fluorination of the new precursor (Compound 9) and purification with plus C18 Sep-Pak cartridges and was compared with two-step one-pot radiosynthesis using the reported precursor (Compound 6) and Sep-Pak cartridge purification.For one-step radiosynthesis, the uncorrected radiochemical yield of [18F]BAY94-9172 was 23\u00b13% (n=5, based on [18F]fluoride) within 30 min and the radiochemical purity was greater than 95%.

Compared with HPLC purification, the use of Sep-Pak purification of [18F]BAY94-9172 reduced the total radiosynthesis time. The one-step radiosynthesis of [18F]BAY94-9172 is convenient and can easily be applied to the commercial PET tracer synthesizer for automated synthesis.",

     "abstract": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) gene is amplified in 25% of invasive breast cancers, and receptor overexpression has been noted in up to 60% of early stages of the disease [ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)]. Preclinical studies have revealed high tumor/blood ratios (>27:1) for 111In-labeled Fab fragments of the HER2 monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin) (111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab) at 72 h pi in athymic mice bearing subcutaneous human breast cancer xenografts. Our aim in this study was to formulate a kit for preparation of 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection under good manufacturing practice (GMP) conditions suitable for human administration in a Phase I clinical trial of imaging and radioimmunoguided surgery (RIGS) of HER2-positive breast cancer.Fab fragments were produced by digestion of trastuzumab IgG (Herceptin) with immobilized papain for 20 h at 37\u00b0C. Fab fragments were purified by ultrafiltration, then reacted with a 10-fold molar excess of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) dianhydride. DTPA-Fab fragments were purified, then sterilized by filtration into unit dose glass vials (kits). Kits were tested against specifications for volume (0.9\u20131.1 ml), protein concentration (0.45\u20130.55 mg/ml), pH (5.5\u20136.5), DTPA substitution (0.5\u20134.0 mol DTPA/mol Fab), appearance (clear, colorless and particle free), labeling efficiency (\u226585%), and sterility and apyrogenicity (USP XXXII). Immunoreactivity of 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab towards HER2 was measured by saturation radioligand binding assays using SKBR-3 human breast cancer cells (specifications: Ka=0.6\u20139.6\u00d7107 L/mol; Bmax=0.6\u201310.4\u00d7106 sites/cell). 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection was prepared by adding 80\u2013100 MBq of 111InCl3 to a single kit vial and incubating for 30 min at room temperature. 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab was assayed for the amount of radioactivity and tested for pH, radiochemical purity (RCP), appearance and sterility.Pure and homogeneous Fab fragments were produced. Eleven lots of kits met established quality specifications. The labeling efficiency with 111In was 90.6\u00b12.2%. 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab bound specifically to HER2 on SKBR-3 cells (Ka=4.8\u00b12.5\u00d7107 L/mol and Bmax=1.6\u00b10.8\u00d7106 sites/cell). Thirteen lots of 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab injection met all established specifications. Kits were stable for 90 days and 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection was stable for 24 h stored at 4\u00b0C.A kit was formulated under GMP conditions for the preparation of 111In-DTPA-trastuzumab Fab injection suitable for human administration.

SPE eluant radioactivity was measured in a \u03b3-counter to determine the parent compound fraction and then analysed by HPLC and TLC for validation.In SPE, hydrophilic and lipophilic radiolabelled metabolites were eluted in water and 20% acetonitrile/water. All non-metabolised [18F]PBR102 and [18F]PBR111 were in SPE acetonitrile fraction as confirmed by HPLC and TLC analysis. Unchanged (%) [18F]PBR102 and [18F]PBR111 from SPE analysis in rat and baboon plasma agreed with those from HPLC and TLC analysis.

After adding the radionuclide, the mixture was shaken for 15 min at 90\u00b0C. Labeling yields and in vitro stability were determined by thin-layer chromatography. For determination of the in vivo stability of Ga-68 and Y-90 DOTA-HSAM, the particles were injected intravenously in Wistar rats.Labeling yields up to 95% in the case of Ga-68 and Lu-177 were achieved. Ga-68-labeled DOTA-HSAM showed high in vitro and in vivo stability. The amount of particle-bound radioactivity of Lu-177 DOTA-HSAM declines slowly in a linear manner to approximately 72% after 13 days. For Y-90, the labeling yield decreased with increasing radioactivity level. We presume radiolysis as the reason for these findings.The labeling of DOTA-HSAM with different radionuclides is easy to perform. The radiation-induced cleavage of the labeled chelator together with the rather short half-life of radioactivity fixation in vivo (3.7 days) is, in our opinion, opposed to therapeutic applications of DOTA-HSAM. On the other hand, the high stability of Ga-68 DOTA-HSAM makes them an attractive candidate for the measurement of regional perfusion by PET.",

     "abstract": "Peptides involving the RGD motive (arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid) recognize members of the integrin receptor family. Since the receptors are located mainly on the surface of endothelial cells, structural modifications including multimers of c(RGDfE) were recently found to improve the binding avidity for \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin significantly. The multivalent RGD peptides exhibited rather loose linkages partly including oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers (EGn) with different chain lengths. Therefore, the dependence of multivalent RGD systems with and without EGn linkers were investigated on their binding properties to cultured \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-expressing U87MG cells.We synthesized a series of di-, tri- and tetravalent rigid scaffolds (terephthalic acid, trimesic acid and adamantane-1,3,5,7-tetracarboxylic acid) conjugated to c(RGDyK) ligands, which were linked contiguously or separated by the oligo(ethylene glycol) spacers. The inhibition constants of these c(RGDyK) derivatives were determined by competition assays with 125I-labeled echistatin.While c(RGDyK) function is a relative weak competitor against [125I]echistatin (Ki, 329\u00b118 nM) for \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-expressing U87MG cells, RGD dimers improved the competition potency considerably (Ki, 64\u00b123 nM). This effect was even more pronounced with the RGD trimers (Ki, 40\u00b17 nM) and tetramers (Ki, 26\u00b19 nM). The introduction of EGn spacers and the increase of linker lengths proved to be detrimental since more competitors were needed to compete with [125I]echistatin. The EG6 group, for example, reduced the inhibition constants by 29% (dimer), 57% (trimer) and 97% (tetramer).The binding experiments performed with the three forms of multivalent RGD ligands indicate the weakening of competitive potency against [125I]echistatin with the introduction of EGn spacers. This effect may be related to the decrease of the effective RGD molarity, which becomes most prominent within the tetravalent series.",

Small animal PET images for labeled compounds showed high tumor uptake, as well as kidney and bladder uptakes, at 30 min postinjection. 68Ga-DO3A-homoalanine showed the highest standardized uptake value ratio (3.9\u00b10.3), followed by 68Ga-DO2A-alanine (3.1\u00b10.2), 68Ga-DO3A-alanine (2.8\u00b10.2) and 68Ga-DO2A-homoalanine (2.3\u00b10.2).These derivatives were found to have high labeling efficiencies, high stabilities, high tumor cell uptakes, high tumor/nontumor xenograft uptakes and low nonspecific uptake in normal organs, except for the kidneys. However, the uptake mechanism of these derivatives remains unclear, and uptake via specific amino acid transporters needs to be demonstrated.",

We examined amino acid transport system L selectivity of 14C(U)-l-tyrosine (14C-Tyr), 125I-4-iodo-l-meta-tyrosine (4-125I-mTyr), 125I-6-iodo-l-meta-tyrosine (6-125I-mTyr), 125I-3-iodo-\u03b1-methyl-l-tyrosine (125I-IMT) and 125I-3-iodo-l-tyrosine (3-125I-Tyr) using Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1).Cells in the exponential growth phase were incubated with 18.5 kBq of labeled amino acid in 2 mL of phosphate-buffered saline-based uptake solution and an uptake solution with/without Na+ at 37\u00b0C or 4\u00b0C. We examined the effects of the following compounds (1.0 mM) on transport: 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid (a specific inhibitor of system A, in Na+-containing uptake solution); 2-amino-bicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (a specific inhibitor of system L, in Na+-free uptake solution); sodium azide and 2,4-dinitrophenol (NaN3 and DNP, inhibitors of the generation of adenosine triphosphate); p-aminohippurate and tetraethylammonium (PAH and TEA, inhibitors of organic anion and cation transporters); and l- and d-isomers of natural amino acids.14C-Tyr exhibited affinity for systems L, A and ASC. 4-125I-mTyr and 3-125I-Tyr exhibited high specificity for system L, whereas 6-125I-mTyr and 125I-IMT exhibited affinity for both systems L and ASC. Uptake of 4-125I-mTyr was markedly reduced by incubation at 4 \u00b0C, and was not significantly inhibited by NaN3, DNP, PAH or TEA. The inhibition profiles of the l- and d-isomers of natural amino acids indicated that system L mediates the transport of 4-125I-mTyr.4-125I-mTyr exhibited the greatest system L specificity (93.46\u00b10.13%) of all of the tested amino acids.",

The purpose of this study is to compare the prognostic significance of 18F-FAMT uptake in the primary tumors with that of LAT1 expression in patients with NSCLC.Fifty-nine patients with NSCLC were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent 18F-FAMT PET prior to resection of the tumor, and immunohistochemical staining of the resected tumors were performed to compare the 18F-FAMT uptake and LAT1 expression. Uptake of 18F-FAMT was evaluated using semiquantitative standardized uptake value (SUVmax), and the cutoff value was determined to discriminate patients with high SUVmax from those with low SUVmax. Expression of LAT1 was evaluated by the score of staining intensity through 1 to 4. SUVmax and LAT1 expression were compared according to the clinicopathological variables.The best discriminative cutoff value of 18F-FAMT SUVmax within the primary tumors was 1.6. The high SUVmax (>1.6) in 18F-FAMT PET was significantly associated with male, and positive LAT1 expression was significantly associated with male and nonadenocarcinoma. In the univariate analysis, high SUVmax (>1.6) in 18F-FAMT PET and positive LAT1 expression were significant predictor of the poor outcome. Multivariate analysis confirmed that positive LAT1 expression was an independent and significant factor for predicting poor prognosis in NSCLC (P=.035).LAT1 expression is a stronger prognostic factor than 18F-FAMT uptake in surgically resected NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "Accumulation of \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) aggregates in the brain is linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Imaging probes targeting these A\u03b2 aggregates in the brain may provide a useful tool to facilitate the diagnosis of AD. Recently, [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) demonstrated high binding to the A\u03b2 aggregates in AD patients. To improve the availability of this agent for widespread clinical application, a rapid, fully automated, high-yield, cGMP-compliant radiosynthesis was necessary for production of this probe. We report herein an optimal [18F]fluorination, de-protection condition and fully automated radiosynthesis of [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) on a radiosynthesis module (BNU F-A2).The preparation of [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) was evaluated under different conditions, specifically by employing different precursors (-OTs and -Br as the leaving group), reagents (K222/K2CO3 vs. tributylammonium bicarbonate) and deprotection in different acids. With optimized conditions from these experiments, the automated synthesis of [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) was accomplished by using a computer-programmed, standard operating procedure, and was puri\ufb01ed on an on-line solid-phase cartridge (Oasis HLB).The optimized reaction conditions were successfully implemented to an automated nucleophilic fluorination module. The radiochemical purity of [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) was >95%, and the automated synthesis yield was 33.6\u00b15.2% (no decay corrected, n=4), 50.1\u00b17.9% (decay corrected) in 50 min at a quantity level of 10\u2013100 mCi (370\u20133700 MBq). Autoradiography studies of [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) using postmortem AD brain and Tg mouse brain sections in the presence of different concentration of \u201ccold\u201d AV-136 showed a relatively low inhibition of in vitro binding of [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) to the A\u03b2 plaques (IC50=1\u20134 \u03bcM, a concentration several order of magnitude higher than the expected pseudo carrier concentration in the brain).Solid-phase extraction purification and improved labeling conditions were successfully implemented into an automated synthesis module, which is more convenient, highly efficient and simpler in operation than using a semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography method. This new, automated procedure for preparation of [18F]AV-45 ([18F]5) is suitable for routine clinical application.",

HO2C-PEG600-DTCZ was obtained by conjugation of N-methyl-S-methyl dithiocarbazate [H2N\u2013N(CH3)\u2013C(S)SCH3, HDTCZ] with polyethylene glycol 600 (PEG600). Asymmetrical heterocomplexes of the type [M(N)(PNP)(B)]0/+ (M=99mTc, 188Re; PNP=diphosphine ligands, B=DBODC, DEDC, NSH, H2OS, CysNAc, HDTCZ) and symmetrical nitride compounds of the type [M(N)(L)2] (L=DEDC, DPDC) have been prepared in high yield by using the newly designed nitride nitrogen atom donor HO2C-PEG600-DTCZ. A two-step procedure was applied for preparing the above symmetrical and asymmetrical complexes. The first step involved the preliminary formation of a mixture of nitride Tc-99m or Re-188 precursors, which contained the [MN]2+ core, through reduction of generator-eluted 99mTc-pertechnetate or 188Re-perrhenate with thin (II) chloride in the presence of HO2C-PEG600-DTCZ. In the second step, the intermediate mixture was converted either in the final mixed asymmetrical complex by the simultaneous addition of diphosphine ligand and the suitable bidentate ligand B, or in the final symmetrical complex by the only addition of the bidentate ligand L. It was also demonstrated that the novel water-soluble nitride nitrogen atom donor HO2C-PEG600-DTCZ did not show coordinating properties toward the MN (99mTc, 188Re) core. Biodistribution studies in rats of the hitherto unreported [99mTc(N)(PNP3)DTCZ]+ and [99mTc(N)(PNP5)DTCZ]+ complexes showed that they selectively localize in the myocardium of rats with a favourable heart-to-lung and heart-to-liver uptake ratios. In particular, the heart-to-lung and heart-to-liver uptake ratios dramatically increased in the interval between 60 and 120 min postinjection. Hence, the combination of the favourable chemical and biological properties of HO2C-PEG600-DTCZ might confer to this novel compound an important role for the development of new 99mTc and 188Re-nitrido radiopharmaceuticals.",

The high recovery and radionuclidic purity obtained for 90Y and the parameters of the separation (time, eluant concentration, pH and flow rate range) strongly suggest that Ci quantities of 90Y can be handled satisfactorily by the ion-exchange method. No replacement or treatment of the cow, low waste generation and 90Sr losses less than 0.1% after each run were observed during the present study which, in combination with the low cost of this resin, may result in an attractive alternate method for the production of large quantities of 90Y.",

The biodistribution study and gamma camera imaging were performed in mice bearing breast tumors. To assess the therapeutic effects of 177Lu-Herceptin, cytotoxicity was investigated for 7 days in a SKBr3 breast cancer cell line.Carbonate buffer was the best conjugation buffer (number of chelates per antibody: 6; incorporated activity: 81%; immunoreactivity: 87%; buffer stability: 86%; serum stability: 81%, after 4 days). The efficient tumor uptake observed in the biodistribution studies was consistent with the gamma camera image results. At a concentration of 4 \u03bcg ml\u22121, 177Lu-Herceptin (surviving cells: 5\u00b10.6% of the total cells) of the total cells corresponded to an approximately eightfold increase in cytotoxicity in comparison to unmodified Herceptin (surviving cells: 43\u00b13.9%).The new complex described herein could be considered for further evaluation in animals and potentially in humans as a radiopharmaceutical for use in the radioimmunotherapy of breast cancer.

The biodistribution of 111Indium-labeled antibodies was followed up to 48 h postinjection using combined SPECT and CT imaging modality. Organ samples were collected postmortem and specific organ activity was measured. Accumulation of the intravenously injected antibodies in the tumor tissue and lymph nodes was verified using immunohistology.Imaging studies with SPECT/CT showed clear accumulation of both antibodies into tumor area. The tumor uptake was 8.78\u00b10.74 %ID/g for cetuximab and 5.77\u00b10.62 %ID/g for mF4-31C1 after 48 h postinjection. Cetuximab had lower liver tropism and faster tumor homing rate.

Both intravenously administered antibodies could also be detected from the tumor sections by immunohistological staining but only mF4-31C1 forms in the lymph nodes.These results demonstrate the accumulation of EGFR- and VEGFR-3-specific antibodies in orthotopic ovarian carcinoma tumors.

The clicked progesterone triazole derivative was radiolabeled with 99mTc and characterized by HPLC.

The objective of this study was to clarify MIBI extraction and washout kinetics using isolated perfusion system in hypertension induced model of myocardial dysfunction.Six-week-old Dahl-salt sensitive rats, allotted to 4 groups; a 5-week high-salt group (5wk-HS), 12-week high-salt group (12wk-HS) and two age-matched, low-salt diet control groups (5wk-LS and 12wk-LS). The rats in 5wk-HS and 12wk-HS groups were fed a high-salt diet (containing 8% NaCl). Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography before removing heart. Hearts were perfused according to the Langendorff method at a constant flow rate, in which 20-min MIBI washin was conducted followed by 25-min MIBI washout. Whole heart radioactivity was collected every sec by an external gamma detector.

There is an armamentarium of fluorine-18 (18F) tracers that can be used for PET studies in the fields of oncology and neurosciences. However, most of the 18F-tracers other than 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) are in less than optimum human use and there is considerable scope to bring potentially useful 18F-tracers to clinical investigation stage.The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) convened a consultants' group meeting to review the current status of 18F-based radiotracers and to suggest means for accelerating their use for diagnostic applications. The consultants reviewed the developments including the synthetic approaches for the preparation of 18F-tracers for oncology and neurosciences. A selection of three groups of 18F-tracers that are useful either in oncology or in neurosciences was done based on well-defined criteria such as application, lack of toxicity, availability of precursors and ease of synthesis. Based on the recommendations of the consultants' group meeting, IAEA started a coordinated research project on \u201cDevelopment of 18F radiopharmaceuticals (beyond [18F]FDG) for use in oncology and neurosciences\u201d in which 14 countries are participating in a 3-year collaborative program. The outcomes of the coordinated research project are expected to catalyze the wider application of several more 18F-radiopharmaceuticals beyond FDG for diagnostic applications in oncology and neurosciences.",

Therefore, copper-64 (64Cu) radiolabeled BBN(7\u201314)NH2 conjugates could have potential for diagnosis of human prostate cancer via positron-emission tomography (PET). The aim of this study was to produce [64Cu-NO2A-(X)-BBN(7\u201314)NH2] conjugates for prostate cancer imaging, where X=pharmacokinetic modifier (beta-alanine, 5-aminovaleric acid, 6-aminohexanoic acid, 8-aminooctanoic acid, 9-aminonanoic acid or para-aminobenzoic acid) and NO2A=1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4-diacetic acid [a derivative of NOTA (1,4,7-triazacyclononane-1,4,7-triacetic acid)].[(X)-BBN(7\u201314)NH2] Conjugates were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), after which NOTA was added via manual conjugation. The new peptide conjugates were radiolabeled with 64Cu radionuclide. The receptor-binding affinity was determined in human prostate PC-3 cells, and tumor-targeting efficacy was determined in PC-3 tumor-bearing severely combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Whole-body maximum intensity microPET/CT images of PC-3 tumor-bearing SCID mice were obtained 18 h postinjection (pi).Competitive binding assays in PC-3 cells indicated high receptor-binding affinity for the [NO2A-(X)-BBN(7\u201314)NH2] and [natCu-NO2A-(X)-BBN(7\u201314)NH2] conjugates. In vivo biodistribution studies of the [64Cu-NO2A-(X)-BBN(7\u201314)NH2] conjugates at 1, 4 and 24 h pi showed very high uptake of the tracer in GRPr-positive tissue with little accumulation and retention in nontarget tissues.High-quality, high-contrast microPET images were obtained, with xenografted tumors being clearly visible at 18 h pi.NO2A chelator sufficiently stabilizes copper(II) radiometal under in vivo conditions, producing conjugates with very high uptake and retention in targeted GRPr. Preclinical evaluation of these new peptide conjugates in tumor-bearing mice provides some impetus for clinical evaluation in human patients.",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether an anti-podoplanin antibody is suitable to target radionuclides to malignant gliomas.The binding affinity of an anti-podoplanin antibody, NZ-1 (rat IgG2a), was determined by surface plasmon resonance and Scatchard analysis. NZ-1 was radioiodinated with 125I using Iodogen [125I-NZ-1(Iodogen)] or N-succinimidyl 4-guanidinomethyl 3-[131I]iodobenzoate ([131I]SGMIB-NZ-1), and paired-label internalization assays of NZ-1 were performed. The tissue distribution of 125I-NZ-1(Iodogen) and that of [131I]SGMIB-NZ-1 were then compared in athymic mice bearing glioblastoma xenografts.The dissociation constant (KD) of NZ-1 was determined to be 1.2\u00d710\u221210 M by surface plasmon resonance and 9.8\u00d710\u221210 M for D397MG glioblastoma cells by Scatchard analysis.

     "abstract": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) when radiolabelled with 99mTc has been proved useful in imaging the side of lymphocytic infiltration in patients with autoimmune disorders and plays a significant role as a T-cell imaging agent. However, the labelling procedures used so far appeared to be rather complex and laborious. The aim of present study was to develop an efficient procedure of 99mTc-labelling of recombinant human interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) via hydrazinonicotinamide (HYNIC) to develop a dry kit formulation.Various molar ratios of rhIL-2/HYNIC (from 1:2 to 1:12) were used at the conjugation step. The conjugates were purified on a PD-10 column to remove the excess of unbound HYNIC, as well as of any aggregates. The final peptide concentration was quantified by the BCA method, and the number of HYNIC molecules incorporated into a rhIL-2 molecule was determined based on the reaction with 2-sulfobenzaldehyde. The 99mTc-labelling was optimized using various amounts of HYNIC\u2013rhIL-2, 99mTc, SnCl2, tricine and nicotinic acid (NA). Quality control included GF-HPLC, ITLC, SDS-PAGE and biological assay. Biodistribution studies were performed in Swiss mice and Wistar rats.Generally, the highest radiolabelling yields were achieved when the HYNIC\u2013rhIL-2 conjugates of ca. 2\u20134 HYNIC molecule substitution ratios were used. The optimal pH of the reaction medium was found to be in the range of 6.5 to 7.0. GF-HPLC analysis indicated that monomer and aggregates of 99mTc-HYNIC\u2013rhIL-2 are formed during radiolabelling. At optimized conditions of wet radiolabelling, the 99mTc-HYNIC\u2013rhIL-2 monomer was obtained with radiochemical purity >99%, specific activity of ca. 4 GBq/mg rhIL-2 and overall yield of ca. 65%. The two-vial freeze-dried kit was prepared: the first vial contained 30 \u03bcg HYNIC\u2013rhIL-2, co-ligands, buffer and antioxidant; the second vial contained tricine and SnCl2. The monomer of 99mTc-HYNIC\u2013rhIL-2 was obtained by gel chromatography on a PD-10 column. No differences between labelled and unlabelled IL2 in terms of biological activity were observed.Our study shows that rhIL-2 can be efficiently radiolabelled with 99mTc via HYNIC, with tricine and NA as co-ligands using a two-vial freeze-dried kit. This enables the preparation of sterile and ready-to-use 99mTc-HYNIC(tricine,NA)-rhIL-2 within 1 h.",

Radiocolloid was injected intradermally at four quadrants of the periareolar region the day before surgery. All patients underwent lymphoscintigraphy 1 h after injection. All nodes having fourfold activity of the background were harvested using gamma probe.Sentinel lymph node (SLN) identification rate by gamma probe was 98% in each group.

Lymphatic vessel visualization was observed in eight (8.1%) of 98 TC patients and in 47 (47.9%) of 98 NC patients (P=.000). SLNs were the only metastatic node(s) in 54.1% of TC and 73.1% of NC patients.The periareolar intradermal injection technique gives a high detection rate in the localization of SLNs independently from the choice of the tracer.

The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the pattern of the 11C-ABP688 uptake using a bolus-plus-infusion (B/I) protocol at early time points corresponds to the perfusion and at a later time point to the total distribution volume.A bolus and a B/I study (1 h each) was performed in five healthy male volunteers. With the B/I protocol, early and late scans were normalized to gray matter, cerebellum and white matter. The same normalization was done on the maps of the total distribution volume (Vt) and K1 which were calculated in the study with bolus only injection and the Logan method (Vt) and a two-tissue compartment model (K1).There was an excellent correlation close to the identity line between the pattern of the late uptake in the B/I study and Vt of the bolus-only study for all three normalizations. The pattern of the early uptake in the B/I study correlated well with the K1 maps, but only when normalized to gray matter and cerebellum, not to white matter.It is demonstrated that with a B/I protocol the 11C-ABP688 distribution in late scans reflects the pattern of the total distribution volume and is therefore a measure for the density pattern of mGluR5. The early scans following injection are related to blood flow, although not in a fully quantitative manner. The advantage of the B/I protocol is that no arterial blood sampling is required, which is advantageous in clinical studies.",

Here, using small-animal PET with [18F]FEDAC, we performed TSPO imaging and quantitative analysis of TSPO binding in rat peripheral tissues.The in vivo distribution and kinetics of [18F]FEDAC were measured in rat peripheral tissues (heart, lung and kidney). Using the in vivo pseudo-equilibrium method, TSPO binding parameters [TSPO density (Bmax), dissociation constant (KD)] and receptor occupancy were estimated in these peripheral tissues.[18F]FEDAC was highly distributed in the lung, heart and kidney, and these TSPO-enriched tissues could be clearly visualized. The kinetics of this radioligand in these tissues was rapid, which is suitable for the determination of in vivo TSPO binding parameters and receptor occupancy. The Bmax value of TSPO in the heart, lung, and kidney was 393, 141, and 158 pmol/ml, respectively. The KD value of the radioligand in the heart, lung, and kidney was 119, 36 and 123 nM, respectively. By pretreatment with 5 mg/kg Ro 5-4864 (a TSPO ligand), about 90% of binding sites for TSPO in the heart and lung were occupied. In the kidney, the binding sites were completely occupied by 5 mg/kg Ro 5-4864.[18F]FEDAC is a suitable PET ligand for TSPO imaging and quantitative analysis of TSPO binding in rat peripheral tissues. The utilization of [18F]FEDAC-PET and the pseudo-equilibrium method can contribute to the study of the TSPO function and evaluate the in vivo binding parameters and receptor occupancy of TSPO therapeutic compounds.",

We are investigating a direct labeling approach for incorporation of a Re ion into octreotide analogues, where the peptide sequences are cyclized via coordination to Re rather than through a disulfide bridge.Various octreotide analogue sequences and coordination systems (e.g., S2N2 and S3N) were synthesized and cyclized with nonradioactive Re. In vitro competitive binding assays with 111In-DOTA-Tyr3-octreotide in AR42J rat pancreatic tumor cells yielded IC50 values as a measure of SSTR affinity of the Re-cyclized analogues. Three-dimensional structures of Re-cyclized Tyr3-octreotate and its disulfide-bridged analogue were calculated from two-dimensional NMR experiments to visualize the effect of metal cyclization on the analogue's pharmacophore.Only two of the 11 Re-cyclized analogues investigated showed moderate in vitro binding affinity toward somatostatin subtype 2 receptors. Three-dimensional molecular structures of Re- and disulfide-cyclized Tyr3-octreotate were calculated, and both of their pharmacophore turns appear to be very similar with minor differences due to metal coordination to the amide nitrogen of one of the pharmacophore amino acids.Various Re-cyclized analogues were developed and analogue 4 had moderate affinity toward somatostatin subtype 2 receptors. In vitro stable studies that are in progress showed stable radiometal cyclization of octreotide analogues via NS3 and N2S2 coordination forming five- and six-membered chelate rings.

Microfluidic represents an innovative approach, owing to its potential to increase radiochemical productivity in terms of yields, time reduction, precursor consumption and flexible experimental planning.We focused on fluorine-18 labeling and used a microfluidic platform to perform sequential reactions, by using the same batch of 18F-labeling solution on one or more substrates, during the same experimental session. A solid-phase extraction (SPE) workup procedure was also implemented in the system to provide a repeatable purification step.We were able to quickly optimize the conditions for labeling of ethyl and propyl ditosylate and of a new cannabinoid type 2 (CB2) receptor agonist, CB41. In all substrates, we obtained good incorporation yields (60% to 85%) in short (<90 s) reaction times. Single dosages of the CB2 ligand were sequentially prepared, upon request, in satisfactory quantities and purity for small animal PET scanning.This work demonstrates the usefulness of a microfluidic-based system for a rapid optimization of temperature, flow rate of reactants and their relative ratio in the labeling of different precursors by using the same 18F-fluoride batch. This approach was used to obtain in sequence several injectable doses of a novel CB2 ligand, thus providing the proof of principle that microfluidic systems permit a dose-on-demand production of new radiotracers.",

Non-invasive positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography by use of selective biomarkers has emerged as valuable tools for the detection of hypoxic areas within tumours so treatment can be modified accordingly. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate [18F]3-NTR, a 3-nitro-1,2,4-triazole analogue (N1 substituted) of [18F]FMISO as a potential hypoxia selective tracer.3-NTR and its 18F-radiolabelled isotopic isomer were synthesised and compared with FMISO in vitro and in vivo. Their physicochemical properties were measured, the enzymatic reduction was evaluated, and the reactivity of their metabolites was investigated. Biodistribution and PET scans were performed on CBA mice bearing hypoxic CaNT tumour cells, using 18F-labelled versions of the tracers.[18F]3-NTR uptake within hypoxic cells was lower than [18F]FMISO and [18F]3-NTR did not exhibit any better selectivity than FMISO as a PET tracer in vivo. Both 18F-radiolabelled compounds are relatively evenly distributed within the whole body and the radioactive uptake within hypoxic tumours reaches a maximum at 30 min post injection and decreases thereafter. Xanthine oxidase exhibited a nitroreductase activity toward 3-NTR under anaerobic conditions, but reduced metabolites did not bind covalently.It is confirmed that 3-NTR is an electron acceptor. It is postulated that radiolabelled metabolites and fragments of [18F]3-NTR are freely diffusing due to their poor binding capacities. Thus [18F]3-NTR cannot be used as a hypoxia selective tracer for PET. The investigation provides insights into the importance of the propensity to form covalent adducts for such biomarkers.",

The aim of this study was to develop a new PET tracer based on 1 to map BCRP expression levels in vivo.Compound 1 was labelled with 11C in its methyl ester function by reaction of the corresponding carboxylic acid 2 with [11C]methyl triflate. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of [11C]-1 was performed in wild-type, Mdr1a/b(\u2212/\u2212), Bcrp1(\u2212/\u2212) and Mdr1a/b(\u2212/\u2212)Bcrp1(\u2212/\u2212) mice (n=3 per mouse type) and radiotracer metabolism was assessed in plasma and brain.Brain-to-plasma ratios of unchanged [11C]-1 were 4.8- and 10.3-fold higher in Mdr1a/b(\u2212/\u2212) and in Mdr1a/b(\u2212/\u2212)Bcrp1(\u2212/\u2212) mice, respectively, as compared to wild-type animals, but only modestly increased in Bcrp1(\u2212/\u2212) mice. [11C]-1 was rapidly metabolized in vivo giving rise to a polar radiometabolite which was taken up into brain tissue.Our data suggest that [11C]-1 preferably interacts with P-gp rather than BCRP at the murine BBB which questions its reported in vitro BCRP selectivity. Consequently, [11C]-1 appears to be unsuitable as a PET tracer to map cerebral BCRP expression.",

The porphyrin was coupled to a suitable chelator, namely, p-aminobenzyl\u20131,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid for complexation with 177Lu.

The 177Lu-labeled porphyrin conjugate was obtained with 99% radiochemical purity and it exhibited good in vitro stability. Biodistribution studies revealed good tumor uptake (2.01% IA/g) within 3 h post injection (p.i.) with >94% injected activity exhibiting renal clearance. No significant accumulation of activity was observed in any of the vital organs/tissue. The tumor/blood and tumor/muscle ratios were 2.89 and 16.80, respectively, at 3 h p.i. and further increased till 2 days p.i. up to which the studies continued. Serial scintigraphic images recorded using a gamma camera exhibited significant accumulation of activity in tumor over background at 3 days p.i., and the activity was observed to be retained in the tumor till 14\u00a0d. Preliminary efficacy studies carried out in Swiss mice bearing fibrosarcoma tumors showed significant regression of the tumor growth in the treated animals.Bioevaluation and preliminary tumor regression studies provide supportive evidences toward the possible potential of the 177Lu-labeled porphyrin for targeted tumor therapy.",

Radiosynthesis of [11C]-1 was performed by methylation using [11C]-CH3I, followed by HPLC purification. Biological evaluation was done by biodistribution studies in wild-type and FAAH knock-out mice, and by ex vivo and in vivo metabolite analysis. The influence of URB597 pretreatment on the metabolisation profile was assessed.[11C]-1 was obtained in good yields and high radiochemical purity. Biodistribution studies revealed high brain uptake in wild-type and FAAH knock-out mice, but no retention of radioactivity could be demonstrated. Metabolite analysis and URB597 pretreatment confirmed the non-FAAH-mediated metabolisation of [11C]-1. The inhibition mechanism was determined to be reversible. In addition, the inhibition of URB597 appeared slowly reversible.Although [11C]-1 inhibits FAAH in vitro and displays high brain uptake, the inhibition mechanism seems to deviate from the proposed carbamylation mechanism. Consequently, it does not covalently bind to FAAH and will not be useful for mapping the enzyme in vivo.

Recent literature demonstrated that cancer cells expressing CD133, which is a frequently used marker for so-called cancer stem cells or cancer stem cell-like cells (collectively referred to here as CSCs), contribute to tumor's therapeutic resistance and metastasis ability. Culturing under hypoxia is also reported to enlarge the proportion of CD133+ cells, which would indicate survival advantage of CD133+ cells under hypoxia. Here, we investigated the relationships between 64Cu-ATSM accumulation and existence of CD133+ cells using mouse colon carcinoma (colon-26) tumor.Intratumor distribution of 64Cu-ATSM and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) was compared with immunohistochemical staining for CD133 with a colon-26 model. In vitro characterization of CD133+ colon-26 cells was also performed.In colon-26 tumors, 64Cu-ATSM localized preferentially in regions with a high density of CD133+ cells. The percentage of CD133+ cells was 11-fold higher in 64Cu-ATSM high-uptake regions compared with 18FDG high- (but 64Cu-ATSM low-) uptake regions. CD133+ colon-26 cells showed characteristics previously linked with CSCs in other cancer cell lines, such as high colony-forming ability, high tumor-initiating ability and enrichment under hypoxic cultivation. The proportion of CD133+ cells was enlarged by culturing under glucose starvation as well as hypoxia, and 64Cu-ATSM uptake was increased under such conditions.Our findings showed that, in colon-26 tumors, 64Cu-ATSM accumulates in rich regions of CD133+ cells with characteristics of CSCs. Therefore 64Cu-ATSM could be a potential imaging agent for rich regions of CD133+ cells, associated with CSCs, within tumors.",

Imaging of VEGF receptor expression in malignant tumors would provide important information, which can influence patient management. The aim of this study was the development of an easy-to-label positron-emitting tracer for imaging VEGF receptors. The tracer is based on engineered single-chain VEGF (scVEGF), expressed with cysteine-containing fusion tag (Cys-tag) for site-specific conjugation of PEGylated bifunctional chelating agents, HBED-CC or NOTA, suitable for labeling with 68Ga at ambient temperature.scVEGF-PEG-HBED-CC was synthesized by activating a single carboxyl group of the [Fe(HBED-CC)]\u2212 complex with N-hydroxysuccinimide. Reaction of the activated complex with NH2-PEG-maleimide was followed by site-specific conjugation of PEGylated chelator to a thiol group in Cys-tag of scVEGF. The scVEGF-PEG-NOTA conjugate was synthesized using NHS-PEG-maleimide and p-NH2-Bn-NOTA. 68Ga complexation was performed in HEPES buffer (pH 4.2) at room temperature. The functional activity after labeling was tested by radioligand cell binding assays. Biodistribution and PET studies in tumor-bearing mice were performed after 1, 2, 3 and 4 h postinjection.The radiolabeling of scVEGF-PEG-HBED-CC proved more efficient than scVEGF-PEG-NOTA allowing to stop the reaction after 4 min (>97% radiochemical yield). Radioligand cell binding assays performed on HEK-293 cells overexpressing VEGFR-2 revealed no change in the binding properties of 68Ga-radiolabeled scVEGF relative to other scVEGF-based tracers. Both tracers showed comparable results in biodistribution, such as tumor accumulation and low liver uptake. The tracers were stable in 50% human serum for at least 72 h.The conjugates scVEGF-PEG-HBED-CC and scVEGF-PEG-NOTA revealed comparable in vivo characteristics and allowed easy-to-perform labeling with high stability for fast [68Ga]PET imaging of VEGF receptors in angiogenic vasculature.",

C-11- and F-18-labeled tetrabenazine derivatives targeting VMAT2 have shown some promising results as potential biomarkers for BCM. In the present study, we examined the binding characteristics of 9-fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenzazine ([18F]AV-133), a potential PET tracer for BCM imaging, in rat pancreas and rat brain.Pancreatic exocrine cells and pancreatic islet cells were isolated and purified from Sprague-Dawley rats. Membrane homogenates, prepared from both pancreatic exocrine and islet cells as well as from brain striatum and hypothalamus regions, were used for in vitro binding studies. In vitro and ex vivo autoradiography studies with [18F]AV-133 were performed on rat brain and rat pancreas sections. Immunohistochemistry studies were performed to confirm the distribution of VMAT2 on islet \u03b2-cells.Excellent binding affinities of [18F]AV-133 were observed in rat striatum and hypothalamus homogenates with Kd values of 0.19 and 0.25 nM, respectively. In contrast to single-site binding observed in rat striatum homogenates, rat islet cell homogenates showed two saturable binding sites (site A: Kd=6.76 nM, Bmax=60 fmol/mg protein; site B: Kd=241 nM, Bmax=1500 fmol/mg protein). Rat exocrine pancreas homogenates showed only a single low-affinity binding site (Kd=209 nM), which was similar to site B in islet cells. In vitro autoradiography of [18F]AV-133 using frozen sections of rat pancreas showed specific labeling of islets, as evidenced by co-localization with anti-insulin antibody. Ex vivo VMAT2 pancreatic autoradiography in the rat, however, was not successful, in contrast to the excellent ex vivo autoradiography of VMAT2 binding sites in the brain. In vivo/ex vivo islet labeling may be complicated by the presence of the low-affinity/high-capacity site B binding in rat pancreas.[18F]AV-133 is an excellent imaging agent for mapping VMAT2 sites in rat brain and specifically binds rat islet cells in vitro and postmortem. Additional optimization may be required to achieve ex vivo islet \u03b2-cell labeling in rats.",

Enzymatic reactions were stopped by adding acetonitrile/methanol (10:1) after various time points and analyzed by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) standard protocol. In vivo experiments were conducted in male wild-type rats; tracers were injected through a tail vein. Rats were sacrificed after various time points (n=3), and blood and brain samples were collected. Sample cleanup was performed by an HPLC standard protocol.The rate of enzymatic hydrolysis by CES demonstrated Michaelis\u2013Menten constants in a micromolar range (FE@SUPPY, 20.15 \u03bcM, and FE@SUPPY:2, 13.11 \u03bcM) and limiting velocities of 0.035 and 0.015 \u03bcM/min for FE@SUPPY and FE@SUPPY:2, respectively.

The distribution of the radiotracer and the extent of TP-specific uptake by tumors were evaluated by a counting method in tumor-bearing mice.The in vitro uptake of radiolabeled IIMU by A431 cells along with high TP expressions was attributed to the binding of the radiotracer to its target enzyme, i.e., TP.

The aim of this research was to study different assay strategies in order to determine the most sensitive system for further application in epitope characterization and binding assessment. The tetrameric isolectin obtained from Vicia villosa seeds (VVLB4) shows high affinity for the tumor-associated structure. A monoclonal antibody against VVLB4, MabVV34, was generated, and the interaction between MabVV34 and VVLB4 was studied by means of binding and inhibition assays. Several synthetic peptides (10 amino acid sequences) designed from the amino acid sequence of VVLB4 and obtained from trypsin digestion were tested to determine which amino acids were involved in the interaction between MabVV34 and VVLB4. The further unraveling of this epitope was investigated by inhibition using designed synthetic peptides as well as mixtures mimicking variable density effect. Under the experimental circumstances, MabVV34 was able to inhibit the binding of VVLB4 to Tn. Two of the four peptide sequences assayed showed better inhibition properties. Finally, mixtures containing these selected sequences allowed the evaluation of binding and inhibition as a function of Tn density. We conclude that the present study facilitates the further development of a specific Tn marker and may contribute to the development of Tn-like radiolabelled peptides or Tn-specific radiolabelled fragments providing a highly selective tool for cancer diagnosis and treatment. This strategy may contribute to characterize the new generation of radiopharmaceuticals for diagnosis and therapy based on biomolecules like antibodies, fragments or peptides, whose application is directly guided by their specific molecular recognition.",

In this study, we evaluated [123I]-4-(2-(bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy)ethyl)-1-(4-iodobenzyl)piperidine ([123I]-FMIP) as a novel single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer for imaging P-gp at the brain in vivo.The tissue distribution and brain uptake as well as the metabolic profile of [123I]-FMIP in wild-type and mdr1a (\u2212/\u2212) mice after pretreatment with physiological saline or cyclosporin A (CsA) (50 mg/kg) was investigated. The influence of increasing doses CsA on brain uptake of [123I]-FMIP was explored. \u03bcSPECT images of mice brain after injection of 11.1 MBq [123I]-FMIP were obtained for different treatment strategies thereby using the Milabs U-SPECT-II.Modulation of P-gp with CsA (50 mg/kg) as well as mdr1a gene depletion resulted in significant increase in cerebral uptake of [123I]-FMIP with only minor effect on blood activity. [123I]-FMIP is relative stable in vivo with >80% intact [123I]-FMIP in brain at 60 min p.i. in the different treatment regiments. A dose-dependent sigmoidal increase in brain uptake of [123I]-FMIP with increasing doses of CsA was observed. In vivo region of interest-based SPECT measurements correlated well with the observations of the biodistribution studies.These findings indicate that [123I]-FMIP can be applied to assess the efficacy of newly developed P-gp modulators. It is also suggested that [123I]-FMIP is a promising SPECT tracer for imaging P-gp at the blood-brain barrier.",

In vitro binding autoradiography on rat brain slices was performed to test the affinity and selectivity of these tracers. Moreover, first \u03bcPET experiments of (R)-[18F]MH.MZ were carried out in Sprague-Dawley rats.[18F]DD-1 (Ki=3.23 nM) and (R)-[18F]MH.MZ (Ki=0.72 nM) were 18F-fluoroalkylated by the secondary synthon [18F]FETos in a radiochemical yield (RCY) of >70%. The final formulation for both tracers took no longer than 100 min with an overall RCY of \u223c40%. It provided [18F]tracers with a purity >96% and a typical specific activity of 25\u201335 GBq/\u03bcmol. Autoradiographic images of (R)-[18F]MH.MZ (5) and [18F]DD-1 (4) showed excellent visualization and selectivity of the 5-HT2A receptor for (R)-[18F]MH.MZ and less specific binding for [18F]DD-1. The binding potential (BP) of (R)-[18F]MH.MZ was determined to be 2.6 in the frontal cortex and 2.2 in the cortex (n=4), whereas the cortex-to-cerebellum ratio was determined to be 3.2 at steady state (n=4). Cortex-to-cerebellum ratios of (R)-[18F]MH.MZ were almost twice as much as compared with the racemic [18F]MH.MZ. Thereby, equal levels of specific activities were used. High uptake could be demonstrated in cortex regions.Labeling of both novel tracers was carried out in high RCY. Autoradiography revealed (R)-[18F]MH.MZ as a very selective and affine 5-HT2A tracer (Ki=0.72 nM), whereas [18F]DD-1 showed no reasonable distribution pattern on autoradiographic sections. Moreover, results from \u03bcPET scans of (R)-[18F]MH.MZ hint on improved molecular imaging characteristics compared with those of [18F]MH.MZ.

Here, we report the radiosynthesis of [11C]papaverine and the in vitro and in vivo evaluation of [11C]papaverine as a potential positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer for imaging PDE10A in the central nervous system (CNS). The radiosynthesis of papaverine with 11C was achieved by O-methylation of the corresponding des-methyl precursor with [11C]methyl iodide. [11C]papaverine was obtained with \u223c70% radiochemical yield and a specific activity >10 Ci/\u03bcmol. In vitro autoradiography studies of rat and monkey brain sections revealed selective binding of [11C]papaverine to PDE10A enriched regions: the striatum of rat brain and the caudate and putamen of rhesus monkey brain. The biodistribution of [11C]papaverine in rats at 5 min demonstrated an initially higher accumulation in striatum than in other brain regions, however the washout was rapid. MicroPET imaging studies in rhesus macaques similarly displayed initial specific uptake in the striatum with very rapid clearance of [11C]papaverine from brain. Our initial evaluation suggests that despite papaverine's utility for in vitro studies and as a pharmaceutical tool, [11C]papaverine is not an ideal radioligand for clinical imaging of PDE10A in the CNS. Analogs of papaverine having a higher potency for inhibiting PDE10A and improved pharmacokinetic properties will be necessary for imaging this enzyme with PET.",

     "abstract": "Cu(II)-ATSM continues to be investigated, both in the laboratory and in the clinic, as a tumor hypoxia imaging agent. However, meaningful interpretation of these images requires a more complete understanding of the mechanism by which the tracer is trapped within the cell. Cu(II)-ATSM is a simple molecule and its biochemical interaction with cells is similarly simple, mainly based upon redox chemistry. Here we suggest that the trapping mechanism is biphasic. The first phase is a reduction/oxidation cycle involving thiols and molecular oxygen. This can be followed by interaction with proteins in the mitochondria leading to more permanent retention of the tracer. The uptake mechanism is complicated by this second step because of the changes in the cell resulting from hypoxia, such as an increase in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) redox state and differences in cellular biochemistry and cell proteomes. These changes may lead to differences in the extent of trapping and retention of the 64Cu in different cell types. For example, copper uptake might be increased in cells with lower pH due to the lower stability of metal bis(thiosemicarbazones) under acidic conditions. Reaction rates with cellular reductants also vary with pH, which differs between cellular organelles. For Cu(II)-ATSM to reach its full potential, more complete characterization of the mechanism of cellular trapping in different cell types is required.",

Mice are placed directly on the tabletop for imaging. Camera imaging performance was evaluated with phantoms and field performance was evaluated in a weeklong In-111 imaging study performed in a mouse tumor xenograft model.Tc-99m performance measurements, using a photopeak energy window of 140 keV\u00b110%, yielded the following results: spatial resolution (FWHM at 1 cm), 2.2 mm; sensitivity, 149 cps (counts per seconds)/MBq (5.5 cps/\u03bcCi); energy resolution (FWHM, full width at half maximum), 10.8%; count rate linearity (count rate vs. activity), r2=0.99 for 0\u2013185 MBq (0\u20135 mCi) in the field of view (FOV); spatial uniformity, <3% count rate variation across the FOV. Tumor and whole-body distributions of the In-111 agent were well visualized in all animals in 5-min images acquired throughout the 168-h study period.Performance measurements indicate that MONICA is well suited to whole-body single photon mouse imaging. The field study suggests that inter-device communications and user-oriented interfaces included in the MONICA design facilitate use of the system in practice. We believe that MONICA may be particularly useful early in the (cancer) drug development cycle where basic whole-body biodistribution data can direct future development of the agent under study and where logistical factors, e.g., limited imaging space, portability and, potentially, cost are important.",

In an attempt to develop an efficient peptide-based radiopharmaceutical for targeting bombesin (BN) receptor-expressing tumors (i.e., breast and prostate), we have prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis, a novel BN analog derived from the universal sequence of BN and conjugated to a widely characterized antineoplastic agent, methotrexate (MTX). MTX-BN, after radiolabeling with 99mTc via stannous-tartrate exchange, showed a good stability against cysteine and histidine transchelation as well as a high in vitro metabolic stability in human plasma. In vitro cell-binding and internalization on MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, T47-D breast cancer and PC-3 prostate cancer cell lines demonstrated high affinity and specificity of 99mTc-MTX-BN towards both human breast and prostate cancer cells (binding affinities in nanomolar range). In addition, the radioconjugate displayed a significant internalization (values ranged between 19\u201335%) into the tumor cells. In vivo biodistribution and clearance kinetics in Balb/c mice are characterized by an efficient clearance from the blood and excretion mainly through the renal-urinary pathway with some elimination via the hepatobiliary system. In vivo tumor uptake in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 cells was 2.70\u00b10.44% ID/g at 1 h, whereas in nude mice with human epidermoid KB cells the accumulation in the tumor was found to be 1.48\u00b10.31% ID/g at 1 h post injection. The tumor uptake was always higher than in the blood and muscle, with good tumor retention and good tumor-to-blood and tumor-to-muscle ratios. The accumulation/retention in the major organs (i.e., lungs, stomach, liver, intestines, etc.) was low to moderate (<6% ID/g) in both healthy and tumor-bearing mice. However, the uptake/retention in the kidneys was rather high (up to 11.05\u00b11.80% ID/g), which is of a concern, particularly for radionuclide therapy. This initial study towards the development of a novel cytotoxic BN conjugate suggest that the combination of favorable in vitro and in vivo properties may render 99mTc-MTX-BN a potential candidate for the targeted imaging and eventually for radionuclide therapy (when labeled with an appropriate radionuclide) of BN receptor-positive tumors and deserves further evaluation.",

FTC-133, 8050C, SW1116, A549 cells, were infected with Bac-GFP. The infection efficiency of Bac-GFP and the intensity of fluorescence, in either the presence or absence of sodium butyrate, were monitored by flow cytometry. The iodine uptake by FTC-133 cells infected with Bac-NIS was measured using a \u03b3 counter. FTC-133 cells were infected with a mixture of equal amounts of Bac-NIS and Bac-GFP at different setting of multiplicity of infection (MOI). The changes of GFP fluorescence intensity and iodine uptake were monitored 24 h after infection in the coinfected cells.We have successfully constructed recombinant baculoviruses carrying NIS and GFP under the control of the cytomegalovirus IE-1 promoter. We found that transduced efficiency of baculovirus in 8505C, SW1116, A549 cells are low in absence of sodium butyrate. Yet Bac-GFP infects FTC-133 cells at a high efficiency, 77.67%, 85.57% and 93.23% with MOI of 100, 200 and 400, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the Bac-GFP infected tumor cells correlated positively with the MOI of the virus. Sodium butyrate induction increased both the infection efficiency and the fluorescence intensity, but increase of infection efficiency was insignificant in FTC-133 cells. Reporter gene (GFP) expression in FTC-133 is stable within 7 days after infection. The radioactivity incorporated by the tumor cells infected with Bac-NIS correlated positively with the MOI of Bac-NIS as well. In tumor cells co-infected with Bac-NIS and Bac-GFP, the amount of radioactivity incorporated significantly correlated with the GFP fluorescence intensity (r=0.922).Baculovirus vectors are powerful vehicles for studying FTC-133 tumor cells in gene delivery. It is feasible to use a baculovirus vector to deliver NIS as a reporter gene to monitor the expression of target genes. This is therefore an effective approach for the detection of target gene expression in gene therapy.",

     "abstract": "[18F]-labelled choline analogues, such as 2-[18F]fluoroethylcholine (18FECH), have suggested to be a new class of choline derivatives highly useful for the imaging of prostate and brain tumours. In fact, tumour cells with enhanced proliferation rate usually exhibit an improved choline uptake due to the increased membrane phospholipids biosynthesis. The aim of this study was the development of a high yielding synthesis of 18FECH. The possibility of shortening the synthesis time by reacting all the reagents in a convenient and rapid one-step reaction was specially considered.18FECH was synthesized by reacting [18F]fluoride with 1,2-bis(tosyloxy)ethane and N,N-dimethylaminoethanol. The synthesis was carried out using both a one- and a two-step reaction in order to compare the two procedures. The effects on the radiochemical yield and purity by using different [18F]fluoride phase transfer catalysts, reagents amounts and purification methods were assessed. Quality controls on the final products were performed by means of radio-thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with conductimetric, ultraviolet and radiometric detectors.In the optimized experimental conditions, 18FECH was synthesized with a radiochemical yield of 43\u00b13% and 48\u00b11% (not corrected for decay) when the two-step or the one-step approach were used, respectively. The radiochemical purity was higher than 99% regardless of the different synthetic pathways or purification methods adopted. The main chemical impurity was due to N,N-dimethylmorpholinium. The identity of this impurity in 18FECH preparations was not previously reported.An improved two-step and an innovative one-step reaction for synthesizing 18FECH in a high yield were reported. The adaptation of a multistep synthesis to a single step process, opens further possibilities for simpler and more reliable automations.",

After antibiotic selection, SSTR expression in stable clones was determined by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence analyses. To assess the in vivo targeting efficiency of the \u201cengineered\u201d A549 cells, the cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice and the biodistribution of 99mTc-RC-160 was assessed at different time points. The tumor inhibitory effects of 131I-RC-160 and/or 5-FC were evaluated by measurement of tumor growth and immunohistochemical analysis.Multiple analyses demonstrated the successful expression of hSSTR2 in A549 cells. In vivo radioimaging revealed specific targeting of RC-160 to the tumors derived from pCIS-A549 cells when compared to those from control A549 cells. The tumor inhibitory rate of pCIS-A549 tumors in the 131I-RC-160 plus 5-FC-treated group was significantly higher than that in the single agent-treated group, control group and control tumors.Co-expression of the hSSTR2 and CD genes in tumor cells can selectively sensitize these cells to the infra-additive effects of radioisotope-labeled RC-160 and 5-FC in vivo. This approach offers a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of lung cancer.",

We aimed to test whether inhibition of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole might reduce the metabolism of [11C]loperamide and [11C]dLop in mice, and thereby improve the quality of these radiotracers.Studies were performed in wild-type and P-gp knockout (mdr\u22121a/b \u2212/\u2212) mice. During each of seven study sessions, one pair of mice, comprising one wild-type and one knockout mouse, was pretreated with ketoconazole (50 mg/kg, ip), while another such pair was left untreated. Mice were sacrificed at 30 min after injection of [11C]loperamide or [11C]dLop. Whole brain and plasma samples were measured for radioactivity and analyzed with radio-high-performance liquid chromatography.Ketoconazole increased the plasma concentrations of [11C]loperamide and its main radiometabolite, [11C]dLop, by about twofold in both wild-type and knockout mice, whereas the most polar radiometabolite was decreased threefold. Furthermore, ketoconazole increased the brain concentrations of [11C]loperamide and the radiometabolite [11C]dLop by about twofold in knockout mice, and decreased the brain concentrations of the major and most polar radiometabolite in wild-type and knockout mice by 82% and 49%, respectively. In contrast, ketoconazole had no effect on plasma and brain distribution of administered [11C]dLop and its radiometabolites in either wild-type or knockout mice, except to increase the low plasma [11C]dLop concentration. The least polar radiometabolite of [11C]dLop was identified with LC-MSn as the N-hydroxymethyl analog of [11C]dLop and this also behaved as a P-gp substrate.In this study, ketoconazole (50 mg/kg, ip) proved partially effective for inhibiting the N-demethylation of [11C]loperamide in mouse in vivo but had relatively smaller or no effect on [11C]dLop.",

Dynamic PET scans were performed in conscious monkeys.The affinity for \u03b17 nAChR was 41 and 182 nM for (R)- and (S)-MeQAA, respectively.

Rats or rabbits were divided into a study group receiving intramyocardial injection of Ad5-tk, and a control group receiving Ad-null injection. In the study group of rats, two sets of experiments, time-course study and dose-dependence study, were performed. In time-course experiments, rats were injected with 131I-FIAU on Days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7, after transfection of 1\u00d7108 pfu Ad5-tk, to study the feasibility and suitable time course for reporter gene imaging. In dose-dependence study, various titers of Ad5-tk (5\u00d7108, 1\u00d7108, 5\u00d7107 and 1\u00d7107 pfu) were used to determine the threshold and optimal viral titer needed for detection of gene expression. The gamma counts of hearts were measured. The rat myocardium was analyzed by ARG and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). SPECT whole-body planar imaging and cardiac tomographic imaging were performed in the rabbit models.From the ARG images, rats injected with Ad5-tk showed significant 131I-FIAU activity in the anterolateral wall compared with background signals seen in the control Ad5-null rats. In time-course study, the highest radioactivity in the focal myocardium could be seen on Day 1, and then progressively declined with time. In dose-dependence study, the level of 131I-FIAU accumulation in the transfected myocardium declined with the decrease of Ad viral titers. From the ARG analysis and gamma counting, the threshold viral titer was 5\u00d7107 pfu, and the optimal Ad titer was 1\u00d7108 pfu. The ARG images in region of interest-derived semi-quantitative study correlated well with ex vivo gamma counting and mRNA levels from RT-PCR analysis. The gamma counting and RT-PCR also correlated well with each other in both sets of experiments. Both SPECT planar and tomographic images showed clear uptake of 131I-FIAU in the anterolateral wall where Ad5-tk was injected.The study confirmed the feasibility of cardiac SPECT reporter gene imaging with HSV1-tk as a reporter gene and 131I-FIAU as a reporter probe. The optimal Ad5-tk titer for imaging was 1\u00d7108 pfu and the optimal imaging time was 1\u20132 days after gene transfer.

P. pastoris strain KM71H was transfected with the recombinant gene, the VEGF-2K protein expressed with methanol induction, and then purified by metal-affinity chromatography. VEGF-2K was modified with 13-mer peptides [CGYG PKKKRKV GG] containing the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of SV-40 large T-antigen (underlined) to promote nuclear uptake following its receptor-mediated internalization.99mTc-DTPA-VEGF-2K bound strongly and preferentially to PAE-Flt-1 cells compared with non-transfected PAE cells, but NLS modification diminished the ratio of PAE-Flt-1 to PAE binding to 2.3-fold. Nuclear accumulation of 99mTc-labeled DTPA-VEGF-2K was not enhanced by NLS modification but was enhanced by 1.5-fold for 111In-DTPA-VEGF-2K-NLS. However, confocal microscopy revealed intranuclear distribution of DTPA-VEGF-2K-NLS, whereas DTPA-VEGF-2K distribution was mainly perinuclear. 111In-DTPA-VEGF-2K-NLS was the most cytotoxic to PAE-Flt-1 cells, reducing their clonogenic survival by 4-fold. 111In-DTPA-VEGF-2K, 99mTc-DTPA-VEGF-2K or 99mTc-DTPA-VEGF-2K-NLS had less effect on the clonogenic survival of PAE-Flt-1 or PAE cells. The strong cytotoxicity of 111In-DTPA-VEGF-2K-NLS toward PAE-Flt-1 cells was associated with a 27-fold increase in nuclear foci of immunofluorescence for phosphorylated histone-2AX corresponding to sites of unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks. Monte Carlo modeling revealed that radionuclide decay in the nucleus would provide a 5-fold higher radiation absorbed dose for 111In than for 99mTc, explaining their differential cytotoxicity, and intranuclear localization would amplify the radiation dose delivered by 111In by 3-fold, explaining the greater potency of 111In-DTPA-VEGF-2K-NLS compared with 111In-DTPA-VEGF-2K.We conclude that targeted Auger electron radiotherapy aimed at Flt-1 receptors is a promising strategy that should be explored further for treatment of tumors in which this angiogenic pathway is up-regulated. 111In is a more cytotoxic radionuclide than 99mTc, unless DNA delivery can be achieved, due to the short range of the electrons emitted.",

However, it appears inferior in vitro due to lower absolute accumulation and smaller anoxic/normoxic uptake ratio. It is possible that the analogues of 99mTc-BnAO have higher hypoxia selectivity after the ligand of 99mTc-BnAO is modified.2,2\u2032-(1,4-Diaminobutane)bis(2-methyl-3-butanone) dioxime (BnAO or HL91) and three novel analogues were synthesized and radiolabeled with technetium-99m. The cellular uptake of the radiolabeled complexes was determined in murine sarcoma S180 cell lines under anoxic and normoxic conditions.99mTc-BnAO and its three novel analogues continuously accumulated in anoxic cells but not in normoxic ones, while the analogues showed earlier hypoxia selectivity and greater anoxic/normoxic differential.The analogues are superior to 99mTc-BnAO in terms of in vitro hypoxia selectivity and are viable candidates for further development as new nonnitroimidazole hypoxia markers in the future.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignancies in the Western world and is an example of a solid tumour in which hypoxia is a common feature and develops because of the inability of the vascular system to supply adequate amounts of oxygen to growing tumours. Hypoxia effects on tumour cell biology can be detected and characterized using different methods. The use of imaging with \u03b3-emitting radionuclides to detect hypoxic tissue was first suggested by Chapman in 1979 [N Engl J Med 301 (1979) 1429\u20131432]. 99mTc-4,9-diaza-3,3,10,10-tetramethyldodecan-2,11-dione dioxime, also known as 99mTc-HL-91, has been among the most studied hypoxia markers.The objective of this study was to correlate the uptake of 99mTc-HL-91 and 99mTc-MIBI in colon cancer cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and to compare this information with some parameters such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction of the cells analyzed by flow cytometry.Our results show that the in vitro 99mTc-HL-91 uptake is higher in hypoxic conditions, which is confirmed by the decreased uptake of 99mTc-MIBI. Flow cytometry results demonstrate that hypoxic conditions used are not enough to induce cellular death, but are responsible for the alterations in the intracellular redox environment, namely, increase of ROS production, proteic pimonidazol-derived adduct formation and alteration in the mitochondrial membrane permeability. Therefore, these results confirm that 99mTc-HL-91 is a radiopharmaceutical with favourable characteristics for detecting hypoxia.",

It is currently under Phase II clinical trials to establish its usefulness in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases including dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease. The radiolabeling of [18F]AV-133, nucleophilic fluorination reaction and potential effects of pseudo-carrier were evaluated by in vivo biodistribution.The preparation of [18F]AV-133 was evaluated under different conditions, specifically by employing different precursors (\u2013OTs or\u00a0\u2013Br as the leaving group at the 9-propoxy position), reagents (K222/K2CO3 vs. tributylammonium bicarbonate) and solvents (acetonitrile vs. DMSO), reaction temperature and reaction time. With optimized conditions from these experiments, radiosynthesis and purification with solid-phase extraction (SPE) of [18F]AV-133 were performed by an automated nucleophilic [18F]fluorination module. In vivo biodistribution in mice on [18F]AV-133 purified by either HPLC (no-carrier-added) or the SPE method (containing a pseudo-carrier) was performed and the results compared.Under a mild fluorination condition (heating at 115\u00b0C for 5 min in dimethyl sulfoxide), [18F]AV-133 was obtained in a high yield using either \u2013OTs or \u2013Br as the leaving group. However, the \u2013OTs precursor gave better radiochemical yields (>70%, thin layer chromatography analysis) compared to those of the \u2013Br precursor. The optimized reaction conditions were successfully implemented to an automated nucleophilic fluorination module. Labeling and purification of [18F]AV133 were readily achieved via this automatic module in good radiochemical yield of 21\u201341% (n=10) in 40 min. The radiochemical purity was larger than 95%. Biodistribution of SPE-purified product (containing a pseudo-carrier) in mice showed a high striatum/cerebellum ratio (4.18\u00b10.51), which was comparable to that of HPLC-purified [18F]AV-133 (4.51\u00b10.10).The formation of [18F]AV-133 was evaluated under different labeling conditions. These improved labeling conditions and SPE purification were successfully implemented into an automated synthesis module. This offers a short preparation time (about 40 min), simplicity in operation and ready applicability for routine clinical operation.",

Our studies have shown that the use of closo-decaborate(2-) moiety for 211At-labeling of biomolecules provides high in vivo stability towards deastatination. However, data from those studies have also been suggestive that some astatinated closo-decaborate(2-) catabolites may be retained in tissues. In this study, we investigated the in vivo distributions of several structurally simple closo-decaborate(2-) derivatives to gain information on the effects of functional groups if catabolites are released into the blood system from the carrier biomolecule.Thirteen closo-decaborate(2-) derivatives were synthesized and radioiodinated for evaluation. Tissue concentrations of the radioiodinated compounds were obtained in groups of five mice at 1 and 4 h postinjection (pi). Dual-label (125I and 131I) experiments permitted evaluation of two compounds in each set of mice.All of the target compounds were readily synthesized. Radioiodination reactions were conducted with chloramine-T and Na[125/131I]I in water to give high yields (75\u201396%) of the desired compounds. Biodistribution data at 1 and 4 h pi (representing catabolites released into the blood system) showed small differences in tissue concentrations for some compounds, but large differences for others. The results indicate that formal (overall) charge on the compounds could not be used as a predictor of tissue localization or retention. However, derivatives containing carboxylate groups generally had lower tissue concentrations. Acid cleavable hydrazone functionalities appeared to be the best candidates for further study.Further studies incorporating hydrazone functionalities into pendant groups for biomolecule radiohalogenation are warranted.",

The tumors were developed by inoculating c-kit-expressing cells into nude mice. 125I- and 111In-labeled anti-c-kit antibodies (12A8 and 41A11) were evaluated in vitro by cell binding, competitive inhibition and cellular internalization assays, and in vivo by biodistribution and imaging studies in tumor-bearing mice.Both 125I- and 111In-labeled antibodies showed specific binding with c-kit-expressing cells with high affinity (dissociation constants = 2.2\u20137.1\u00d7109 M\u22121). Internalization assay showed that 125I-labeled antibodies were rapidly internalized and dehalogenated, with the release of 125I from the cells, resulting in reduction of cell-associated radioactivity with time. In contrast, 111In-labeled antibody was internalized but did not result in the reduced radioactivity associated with tumor cells. Reflecting this phenomenon, the in vivo tumor uptake of 125I-labeled antibody was low on Day 1, further decreasing with time, while tumor uptake of 111In-labeled antibody was high on Day 1, further increasing with time. The xenografted tumor was clearly visualized by scintigraphy after injection of 111In-labeled antibody.The anti-c-kit monoclonal antibody labeled with a metal radionuclide would be promising for c-kit-targeted imaging of GISTs.",

As LAT1 is highly expressed in actively proliferating tumors, we made a preliminary investigation of the effects of amino acid esters on enhancement of 125I-3-iodo-\u03b1-methyl-l-tyrosine (IMT) uptake via LAT1 in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells.Because the sequence of the CHO-K1 LAT1 gene is not available, we confirmed LAT1 expression through IMT (18.5 kBq) uptake mechanisms using specific inhibitors. l-Gly, l-Ser, l-Leu, l-Phe, l-Met, l-Tyr, d-Tyr, l-Val and l-Lys ethyl/methyl esters were tested in combination with IMT. Time-course studies over a 3-h period were conducted, and the concentration dependence of l-Tyr ethyl and methyl esters (0.001 to 10 mM) in combination with IMT was also examined. For a proof of de-esterification of l- and D-Tyr ethyl and methyl esters in the cells (by enzymatic attack or other cause), the concentration of l- and d-Tyr was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography of the esters in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and cell homogenates at 37\u00b0C or under ice-cold conditions.Inhibition tests suggested that LAT1 is involved in IMT uptake by CHO-K1 cells. Co-administration of 1 mM of l-Tyr ethyl or methyl ester with IMT produced the greatest enhancement. The de-esterification reaction was stereo selective and temperature dependent in the homogenate. De-esterification kinetics were very fast in the homogenate and very slow in the phosphate buffer.The l-Tyr ethyl or methyl esters were the most effective enhancers of IMT uptake into CHO-K1 cells and acted by trans-stimulation of the amino acid exchange function of LAT1. This result suggests that de-esterification in the cells may be caused by enzymatic attack. We will use IMT and l-Tyr ethyl or methyl esters to examine LAT1 function in tumor cells or tissues in vivo.",

[11C]P943 was synthesized via N-methylation of the precursor with [11C]methyl iodide or [11C]methyl triflate using automated modules.

Binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the equilibrium ratios of regions to cerebellum. The tracer uptake was highest in the globus pallidus and occipital cortex, moderate in basal ganglia and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum, which is consistent with the known brain distribution of 5-HT1B receptors. Infusion of tracer at different specific activities (by adding various amount of unlabeled P943) reduced BPND values in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the saturability of the tracer binding. Blocking studies with GR127935 (2 mg/kg iv), a selective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D antagonist, resulted in reduction of BPND values by 42-95% across regions; for an example, in occipital region from 0.71 to 0.03, indicating a complete blockade.

This paper reports the results of a multispecies biodistribution and toxicity studies of 177Lu-EDTMP to collect preclinical data for starting human clinical trials.177Lu-EDTMP with radiochemical purity greater than 99% was formulated by using a lyophilized kit of EDTMP (35 mg of EDTMP, 5.72 g of CaO and 14.1 mg of NaOH). Biodistribution studies were conducted in mice and rabbits. Small animal imaging was performed using NanoSPECT/CT (Mediso, Ltd., Hungary) and digital autoradiography. Gamma camera imaging was done in rabbits and dogs. Four levels of activity (9.25 through 37 MBq/kg body weight) of 177Lu-EDTMP were injected in four groups of three dogs each to study the toxicological effects.177Lu-EDTMP accumulated almost exclusively in the skeletal system (peak ca. 41% of the injected activity in bone with terminal elimination half-life of 2130 and 1870 h in mice and rabbits, respectively) with a peak uptake during 1\u20133 h. Excretion of the radiopharmaceutical was through the urinary system. Imaging studies showed that all species (mouse, rat, rabbit and dog) take up the compound in regions of remodeling bone, while kidney retention is not visible after 1 day postinjection (pi). In dogs, the highest applied activity (37 MBq/kg body weight) led to a moderate decrease in platelet concentration (mean, 160 g/L) at 1 week pi with no toxicity.The protracted effective half-life of 177Lu-EDTMP in bone supports that modifying the EDTMP molecule by introducing 177Lu does not alter its biological behaviour as a specific bone-seeking tracer. Species-specific pharmacokinetic behavior differences were observed. Toxicity studies in dogs did not show any biological adverse effects. The studies demonstrate that 177Lu-EDTMP is a promising radiopharmaceutical that can be further evaluated for establishing as a radiopharmaceutical for human use.",

The in vitro number of VMAT2 binding sites was determined by autoradiography.Repeated dosing with \u03b1-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) at doses that significantly (\u221275%) depleted brain tissue dopamine levels resulted in increased (+36%) in vivo [11C]DTBZ binding to VMAT2 in the striatum. The increase in binding could be completely reversed via treatment with l-DOPA/benserazide to restore dopamine levels. There were no changes in the total number of VMAT2 binding sites, as measured using in vitro autoradiography. No changes were observed for in vivo [11C]MPH binding to the dopamine transporter in the striatum following AMPT pretreatment.These results indicate that large reductions in dopamine concentrations in the rat brain can produce modest but significant changes in the binding of radioligands to VMAT2, which can be reversed by replenishment of dopamine using exogenous l-DOPA.",

As a potentially more sensitive PET tracer for neuroinflammation, [11C]-N-(2,5-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-(4-fluoro-2-phenoxyphenyl)-acetamide (DAA1106) was evaluated in a rat model of herpes encephalitis.Male Wistar rats were intranasally inoculated with HSV-1 (HSE) or phosphate-buffered saline (control). At Day 6 or Day 7 after inoculation, small-animal [11C]-DAA1106 PET scans were acquired, followed by ex vivo biodistribution. Arterial blood sampling was performed for quantification of uptake.In HSE rats, a significantly higher ex vivo, but not in vivo, uptake of [11C]-DAA1106 was found in almost all examined brain areas (24\u201371%, P<.05), when compared to control rats. Pretreatment with unlabeled PK11195 effectively reduced [11C]-DAA1106 uptake in HSE rats (54\u201384%; P<.001).

However, neuroinflammation could not be demonstrated in vivo by [11C]-DAA1106 PET.

In the abscess, following bacterial ingestion or PMN activation by inflammatory mediators, PMN apoptosis is elevated and leads to the externalization of phosphatidylserine. Annexin-V (AnxV) has been shown to have high affinity to externalized phosphatidylserine. We hypothesized that 99mTc-AnxV will target high densities of apoptotic PMNs and image abscesses. AnxV, conjugated with hydrazinenicaotinamide (HYNIC), was labeled with reduced 99mTcO4\u2212 and its purity was determined by instant thin-layer chromatography. Apoptosis was induced in isolated human PMNs by incubation in 2% saline for 17 and 22 h at 37\u00b0C. PMNs were then incubated with 99mTc-HYNIC-AnxV and associated 99mTc was determined.

These radioligands are considered particularly powerful for detection of endogenous dopamine release, but they either provide PET brain images with limited contrast or have affinity for both D2 and D3 receptors. We here present the carbon-11 radiolabeling and ex vivo evaluation of 2-Cl-(\u2212)-NPA, a novel PET-tracer candidate with high in vitro D2/D3 selectivity.2-Cl-[11C]-(\u2212)-NPA and [11C]-(\u2212)-NPA were synthesized by a two step N-acylation-reduction process using [11C]-propionyl chloride. Awake rats were injected with either tracer, via the tail vein. The rats were decapitated at various times, the brains were removed and quickly dissected, and plasma metabolites were measured. Radioligand specificity, and P-glycoprotein involvement in brain uptake, was also assessed.2-Cl-[11C]-(\u2212)-NPA and [11C]-(\u2212)-NPA were produced in high specific activity and purity. 2-Cl-[11C]-(\u2212)-NPA accumulated slower in the striatum than [11C]-(\u2212)-NPA, reaching maximum concentrations after 30 min. The maximal striatal uptake of 2-Cl-[11C]-(\u2212)-NPA (standard uptake value 0.72\u00b10.24) was approximately half that of [11C]-(\u2212)-NPA (standard uptake value 1.37\u00b10.18). Nonspecific uptake was similar for the two compounds. 2-Cl-[11C]-(\u2212)-NPA was metabolized quickly, leaving only 17% of the parent compound in the plasma after 30 min. The specific binding of 2-Cl-[11C]-(\u2212)-NPA was completely blocked and inhibition of P-glycoprotein did not alter the brain uptake.Ex vivo experiments showed, despite a favorable D2/D3 selectivity, that 2-Cl-[11C]-(\u2212)-NPA is inferior to [11C]-(\u2212)-NPA as a PET tracer in rat, because of slower brain uptake and lower specific to nonspecific binding ratio.",

The AmBaSar was labeled with 64Cu2+ in pH 5.0 ammonium acetate buffer solution at room temperature, followed by analysis and purification with HPLC.

Measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and CMRO2 in five normal rats was performed using a small animal PET scanner after the injection of H215O and 15O2-HbV to evaluate the precision of hemodynamic parameters quantitatively.The labeling efficiency of HbV was significantly increased when vortexing and bubbling were combined compared with the simple bubbling method (P<.05).

The mean radioactivity of 214.4\u00b17.8 MBq/mL HbV was obtained using this method.
