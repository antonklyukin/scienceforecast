     "abstract": "Radiosynovectomy (RS) is a simple, effective and safe procedure for the control of haemophilic synovitis that causes repetitive haemarthrosis. It must be done after confirming clinically (hard and painless mass on palpation) and by ultrasonography the existence of synovitis in a joint with recurrent haemarthrosis. RS should be the first invasive option (instead of arthroscopic synovectomy) for treatment of chronic synovitis. The technique is highly cost effective in comparison to arthroscopic synovectomy. The indication for RS is the presence of repeated haemarthroses associated with synovitis (confirmed clinically and by imaging techniques) that cannot be controlled by means of haematological treatment. No increase in the risk of cancer has been published and the dose of radiation utilized in RS is minimal. In haemophilic patients with recurrent haemarthrosis, RS should be performed under factor coverage as soon as possible, once the existence of synovitis has been confirmed by ultrasonography. RS should really be considered as a useful adjunctive procedure to the primary intervention, which is intensive replacement therapy.",

     "abstract": "An alternative to human red blood cells (RBCs) for clinical transfusion would be advantageous, particularly in situations of massive acute blood loss (where availability and compatibility are limited) or chronic hematologic diseases requiring frequent transfusions (resulting in alloimmunization). Ideally, any alternative must be neither immunogenic nor pathogenic, but readily available, inexpensive, and physiologically effective. Pig RBCs (pRBCs) provide a promising alternative due to their several similarities with human RBCs, and our increasing ability to genetically-modify pigs to reduce cellular immunogenicity. We briefly summarize the history of xenotransfusion, the progress that has been made in recent years, and the remaining barriers. These barriers include prevention of (i) human natural antibody binding to pRBCs, (ii) their phagocytosis by macrophages, and (iii) the T cell adaptive immune response (in the absence of exogenous immunosuppressive therapy). Although techniques of genetic engineering have advanced in recent years, novel methods to introduce human transgenes into pRBCs (which do not have nuclei) will need to be developed before clinical trials can be initiated.",

Despite long experience in treating haemophilia A, we are only beginning to understand the functions of FVIII beyond its established role as a coenzyme to factor IXa to expedite thrombin generation through the intrinsic pathway of coagulation. Here, we review the current role of FVIII coagulant (FVIII:C) in haemophilia A management and emerging evidence for the role of FVIII across multiple systems, including the cardiovascular system, angiogenesis and maintenance of bone health. For instance, supraphysiological FVIII levels are a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. von Willebrand factor (VWF), which forms a non-covalent complex with circulating FVIII, is an established marker and regulator of angiogenesis. In a mouse model of haemophilia, treatment with FVIII decreased expression of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u0392 ligand (RANKL), a marker for bone turnover. Longitudinal follow-up data in people with haemophilia A are needed to confirm and extend these observations.",

Several models have been used for cardiovascular risk prediction based on traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Among them, hypertension represents a factor that may be triggered by distinct pathogenetic mechanisms in specific disease populations. Accumulating evidence points towards an increased incidence of hypertension in patients with hematologic malignancies and recipients of hematopoietic cell transplantation. However, the role of hypertension in these entities remains under-reported in the relevant literature. In the complex setting of life-threatening conditions that need immediate and aggressive treatment, conditions that are common and easy to diagnose such as hypertension, may be neglected by treating physicians. However, hypertension may represent a key diagnostic and prognostic clinical finding in acute syndromes, such as thrombotic microangiopathy. Furthermore, hypertension may arise as a late effect of long-term survivors leading to increased morbidity and mortality across all age groups. Our concise review focuses on incidence, pathophysiology and management of hypertension in patients following hematopoietic cell transplantation and treatment for hematologic malignancies.",

Moreover, cancer is assumed to modify the risk of thromboembolisms and bleeding. A thorough and adequate understanding of these risks is however lacking, as current literature is scarce and show ambiguous results in AF patients. The standardized risk-models that normally aid the clinician in the decision of initiating anticoagulant therapy do not take the presence of malignancy into account. Other factors that complicate risk assessment in AF patients with cancer include drug-drug interactions and other cancer-related comorbidities such as renal impairment.

     "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) consist of a heterogeneous group of myeloid neoplasms characterized by inefficient hematopoiesis, variable cytopenias and a considerable risk of progression to acute myeloid leukemia. Epidemiological assessment of MDS has been hampered by evolving diagnostic criteria and delayed classification of MDS as cancers until 2001. The poorly-understood nature of these neoplasms combined with the lack of effective therapies for decades contributed to suboptimal case ascertainment and underreporting. The annual age-adjusted incidence in the United States is approximately 4.0/100,000 persons, and the incidence substantially rises with age. Beyond age, other risk factors include male gender, obesity, smoking, and prior receipt of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, but most cases remain idiopathic in nature. The overall 5-year survival probability remains relatively poor at approximately 31% without a clear temporal improvement in outcomes despite the approval of three MDS-specific therapies since 2004 and increasing use of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Better understanding of epidemiological trends of MDS will likely require incorporation of the key genetic determinants of the disease into consistent diagnostic paradigms that go beyond traditional morphologic assessments. The heterogeneity of the disease and lack of uniformly-defined genetic markers makes such a task difficult. Thorough case ascertainment and reporting efforts can provide vital insights that could inform treatment decisions and eventually improve the outcomes of patients with MDS.",

CAR T-cell therapies are being developed for multiple myeloma, and clear evidence of clinical activity has been generated. A barrier to widespread use of CAR T-cell therapy is toxicity, primarily cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity. Manifestations of CRS include fevers, hypotension, hypoxia, end organ dysfunction, cytopenias, coagulopathy, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Neurologic toxicities are diverse and include encephalopathy, cognitive defects, dysphasias, seizures, and cerebral edema. Our understanding of the pathophysiology of CRS and neurotoxicity is continually improving. Early and peak levels of certain cytokines, peak blood CAR T-cell levels, patient disease burden, conditioning chemotherapy, CAR T-cell dose, endothelial activation, and CAR design are all factors that may influence toxicity. Multiple grading systems for CAR T-cell toxicity are in use; a universal grading system is needed so that CAR T-cell products can be compared across studies. Guidelines for toxicity management vary among centers, but typically include supportive care, plus immunosuppression with tocilizumab or corticosteroids administered for severe toxicity. Gaining a better understanding of CAR T-cell toxicities and developing new therapies for these toxicities are active areas of laboratory research. Further clinical investigation of CAR T-cell toxicity is also needed. In this review, we present guidelines for management of CRS and CAR neurotoxicity.",

A narrative review of the English literature up to April 2018 was performed. The available evidence demonstrates an increased rate of bone resorption and an excess of osteoporosis among patients with hemophilia. FVIII and FIX may act through at least two pathways: promoting bone formation by a thrombin-mediated mitogenic effect on osteoblasts and by cytokine-mediated osteoclast activity.

Although some very well validated scores delineate the risk of VTE by cancer subtype and other risk factors, hematologic malignancies are underrepresented in these models.

The overall risk of VTE in patients with leukemia depends on the use of L-asparaginase treatment, older age, comorbidities and central venous catheters. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia are at particularly high risk of VTE but also have an increased risk of bleeding. Patients with aggressive lymphomas have a high incidence of VTE, roughly 10%. Patients with multiple myeloma at highest risk of VTE are those receiving immunomodulatory agents such as thalidomide or lenalidomide.

Resveratrol has potent inhibitory activity in vitro against various tumor types, including cell lines derived from virtually all blood malignancies. Pharmacological studies have shown that resveratrol is safe for humans but has poor bioavailability, due to its extensive hepatic metabolism. Curiously, a substantial proportion of the orally administered resveratrol can reach the bone marrow compartment. Notably, various pathways dysregulated in blood cancers are known to be molecular targets of resveratrol, thus substantiating the potential utility of this agent in blood malignancies. In this review, we primarily focus on the scientific evidence that supports the potential utility of resveratrol for the management of select hematological malignancies.

Lifelong prophylaxis\u2014initiated after the first bleeding episode\u2014leads to a dramatic decrease in arthropathy in haemophilia patients. However, adherence to continuous intravenous administrations of factor VIII (FVIII) or FIX products is challenging, and patients potentially suffer from breakthrough bleedings while on prophylaxis. Newer FVIII/FIX products with enhanced convenience attributes and/or easier infusion procedures are intended to improve adherence. However, pharmacokinetic data should be harmonised with information from individual attitudes and treatment needs, to tailor intravenous dosing and scheduling in patients who receive extended half-life products. Nor is there sound evidence as to how subcutaneous non-FVIII/FIX replacement approaches (concizumab; emicizumab; fitusiran) or single intravenous injections of adeno-associated viral vectors (when employing gene therapy) will revolutionize adherence in haemophilia. In rheumatoid arthritis, repeated ultrasound examination of a patient's major joints is a valuable tool to educate patients and parents to understand the disease and provide an objective framework for clinicians to acknowledge patient's adherence. Joint ultrasound examination in haemophilia significantly correlates with cartilage damage, effusion, and synovial hypertrophy evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, in patients with haemophilia undergoing prophylaxis with an extended half-life product for a\u202f\u2248\u202f2.8\u202fyear period, a significant continued improvement in joint health is detected at the physical examination. This provides the rationale for studies on repeated ultrasound examinations of joint status to attempt to remedy sub-optimal medication adherence and help identify which approach is most suited on which occasion and for which patient.",

While serving limited roles in hemostasis, pre-clinical and epidemiologic data indicate that these proteins contribute to pathologic coagulation.

These effects could be partially attenuated by iron-chelation treatment with deferasirox, suggesting iron toxicity may have a negative impact on the hematopoietic microenvironment. Iron toxicity is of concern in transfusion-dependent patients. Importantly, iron chelation with deferasirox can cause the loss of transfusion dependency and may induce hematological responses, although the mechanisms through which deferasirox exerts this action are currently unknown.

The evolving role of MRD status as a potential surrogate for predicting long-term survival has enhanced the clinical need to standardize and incorporate emerging technologies that enable deeper responses beyond those recognized by the IWG, and to pre-emptively identify patients at risk of early relapse. The potential for therapeutic interventions to erase MRD and alter the natural history represents an important and open research question. Reviewed here are some of the implications and challenges associated with establishing and incorporating new treatment response criteria, initially into clinical research, and eventually into real-world practice.",

     "abstract": "The JAK2V617F-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) serve as an excellent model for the study of genomic instability accumulation during cancer progression. Recent studies highlight the implication of JAK2 activating mutations in the development of DNA damage via reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, replication stress induction and the accumulation of genomic instability via the increased degradation of p53 and acquisition of a \u201cmutagenic\u201d phenotype. The accumulation of genomic instability and acquisition of mutations in critical DNA damage repair (DDR) mediators appears to be implicated in the progression of JAK2V617F-positive MPN. On the other hand, JAK2 signaling normally induces DDR through activation of repair mediators such as Chk1, RAD51 and RECQL5. These opposing effects on DNA integrity in the setting of JAK2V617F have significant clinical implications and have led to the introduction of novel combinational therapies for these diseases. The inhibition of MDM2 with Nutlin-3 improves the efficacy of IFN-\u03b1 via decreased p53 degradation, the combination of hydroxyurea with Ruxolitinib, and their combination with PARP inhibitors have significant anti-tumor effects. A better understanding of the implication of JAK2 in the development and repair of DNA damage can improve our understanding of the biology of these neoplasms, meliorate the risk stratification of our patients and enrich our therapeutic armamentarium.",

Tumor vaccines are being explored as a therapeutic strategy to re-educate host immunity to recognize and target malignant cells through the activation and expansion of effector cell populations. Via several mechanisms, tumor cells induce T cell dysfunction and senescence, amplifying and maintaining tumor cell immunosuppressive effects, resulting in failure of clinical trials of tumor vaccines and adoptive T cell therapies. The fundamental premise of successful vaccine design involves the introduction of tumor-associated antigens in the context of effective antigen presentation so that tolerance can be reversed and a productive response can be generated. With the increasing understanding of the role of both the tumor and tumor microenvironment in fostering immune tolerance, vaccine therapy is being explored in the context of immunomodulatory therapies. The most effective strategy may be to use combination therapies such as anti-cancer vaccines with checkpoint blockade to target critical aspects of this environment in an effort to prevent the re-establishment of tumor tolerance while limiting toxicity associated with autoimmunity.",

     "abstract": "At first sight the bleeding disorder hemophilia A seems to have little in common with immune disorders, but immunology research intersects with other disciplines including hematology.Nowadays, the most important complication in the treatment of hemophilia A is the development of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against exogenous administered factor VIII (FVIII), which occurs in approximately 30% of all patients with severe hemophilia A. This antibody response renders FVIII replacement therapy ineffective, thereby increasing the risk for uncontrollable bleeding and morbidity, decreasing quality of life and increasing healthcare costs. The only proven effective therapy to eradicate these inhibitors is immune-based. Using a protocol called \u201cimmune tolerance induction\u201d (ITI), the repeated and frequent administration of FVIII under non-inflammatory conditions downregulates the established antibody response and induces immune tolerance.There has been progress in research clarifying the mechanisms that mediate tolerance induction using ITI, both from patient studies and from research in cell culture and animal-based models. Peripheral tolerance induction to FVIII involves the apoptosis of antigen-specific B-memory cells, anergy induction in antigen-specific effector T-cells (Teff), induction of regulatory T-cells (Treg) and the formation of anti-idiotypic antibodies. In this review hemophilia A will be used as an example to discuss current concepts of tolerance induction as they are applied in patient care. Where possible, we will extrapolate tolerance findings in hemophilia A to related pathways known to affect auto-immune disorders or allergy.",

While an increasing number of patients with acute leukemia are being treated with unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) or umbilical cord blood transplants (UCBT), recent comparative reports of these 2 procedures are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of the safety and efficacy of unrelated HSCT and unrelated single-unit UCBT for the treatment of pediatric and adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The primary outcomes were the rates of relapse, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and days to neutrophil and platelet recovery. Pooled effects (odds ratios [OR] or difference in means) were determined with either random- or fixed-effects models. Our meta-analysis included 9 studies that enrolled 6762 patients (UCBT: n\u00a0=\u00a02026; HSCT: n\u00a0=\u00a04736). The risk of relapse for patients undergoing UCBT was similar to that of patients who received an HSCT (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.030; 95%CI, 0.767 to 1.383, P\u00a0=\u00a00.847).

Excellent treatment options are now available with drugs such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), arsenic trioxide (ATO), anthracyclines and cytarabine. The outcome in APL has improved tremendously in the last 50\u00a0years due to better understanding of the disease, development of effective targeted agents and improvement in supportive care. Carefully selected groups of patients treated in large multi-center trials on a protocol and in experienced centers have shown survival rates in excess of 85%. However population data and other studies show that approximately 30% of patients die during induction. This is an Institutional, national and global problem and remains a pressing and frustrating challenge in APL.While most APL experts are aware of the high rate of early deaths (ED), such awareness is not typically present among general hematologists and oncologists. Our area of focus over the last 7\u00a0years has been the reduction of ED in both academic and community centers; as a result we have acquired substantial experience in APL induction. Two centers have implemented population-wide prospective trials; Brazil and Georgia/South Carolina, USA with improvement in the ED rate. Both centers used standardized guidelines along with consultative support and sharing of expertise which proved effective and helped to decrease ED.Induction mortality in APL is 30% or greater. We believe ED is largely preventable and population-wide survival can be improved. An effective strategy is to utilize a set of simplified treatment guidelines coupled with support from a group of experts during induction. Treating oncologists in both academic and community hospitals should receive aggressive education about ED and be encouraged to seek advice from a core group of established APL experts.

The rarity of the disease and the simultaneous involvement of its associated myeloid compartment have complicated in vitro studies of human erythroleukemia cell lines. Although murine and cell line erythroleukemia models have provided valuable insights into pathophysiology, translation of these concepts into treatment are not forthcoming. Integration of knowledge gained through a careful study of these models with more recent data emerging from molecular characterization will help elucidate key mechanistic pathways and provide a much needed framework that accounts for erythroid lineage-specific attributes. In this article, we discuss the evolving diagnostic concept of erythroleukemia, translational aspects of its pathophysiology, and promising therapeutic targets through an appraisal of the current literature.",

FVIII/FIX intravenous infusion is mainly used to lessen pain, followed in frequency by usage of NSAIDS (primarily COX-2 inhibitors). In about 30% of patients, pain continues after infusion of F VIII/IX. In acute haemarthroses pain treatment must continue until total disappearance (checked by ultrasonography) and include haematologic treatment, short-term rest of the involved joint, cryotherapy, joint aspiration and analgesic medication (paracetamol in mild pain, metamizole for more intense pain, and in a few precise patients, soft opioids such as codeine or tramadol). In the circumstance of intolerable pain we should use morphine hydrochloride either by continual infusion or a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, determined by the age, mental condition and grade of observance of the patient. Epidural blocks utilizing bupivacaine and fentanyl may be very efficacious as well. Three main strategies to alleviate chronic musculo-skeletal pain secondary to haemophilic arthropathy (joint degeneration) exist: pharmacologic management, physical medicine and rehabilitation, and intra-articular injections. As for pharmacologic management, NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib, robecoxib) are better than paracetamol. The advantages of tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol and non-tramadol opioids are scanty. With respect to physical medicine and rehabilitation, there is insufficient confirmation that a brace has supplementary favourable effect compared with isolated pharmacologic management. Land-based curative exercise and watery exercise have at the minimum a tiny short-run benefit. Curative ultrasound can be helpful (poor quality of evidence). The efficacy of transcutaneous electrostimulation (TENS) for pain mitigation has not been proved. Electrical stimulation treatment can procure notable ameliorations. With respect to intra-articular injections, viscosupplementation appears to be a useful method for pain alleviation in the short-run (months). The short-run (weeks) advantage of intra-articular corticosteroids in the treatment of joint pain has been shown.",

This survival disparity is likely due to differences in tumor biology, treatment-related toxicities, and nonmedical issues. This review summarizes these differences as well as focusing on the various trials that have demonstrated superior outcomes with pediatric protocols in AYAs with ALL. Even with the widespread use of these protocols, a treatment gap remains, and novel therapies are one way to address this problem. Still, these therapies also have significant toxicities and unique issues that need to be tested further, especially in the AYA population. The development of more AYA-specific trials will be an important way to examine novel therapies and interventions designed to reduce treatment-related toxicities and improve long-term outcomes.",

Transferrin supplementation may be beneficial in two ways. First, transferrin can correct anemia by modulating the amount of iron that is available for erythropoiesis. This is obvious for patients that suffer from hypotransferrinemia, but may also have beneficial effects for \u03b2-thalassemia patients. Second, under conditions of iron overload, transferrin reduces oxidative stress by binding free iron in the circulation and in tissues. Hereby, transferrin protects the host against the reactive oxygen species that can be formed as a consequence of free iron.

Transferrin may also be beneficial in lung injury, ischemia-reperfusion injury and hypomyelination.This review summarizes the preclinical and clinical data on the efficacy of exogenous transferrin administration to modulate certain forms of anemia and to prevent the toxic effects of free iron.

There is a high rate of recurrent thrombosis in APS, especially in triple positive patients (patients with lupus anticoagulant, aCL and anti-\u03b22GPI antibodies), and indefinite anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist is the standard of care for thrombotic APS.

In particular, knowledge on the mutational landscape of indolent B-cell lymphomas has strongly increased in recent years and harbors great promise for more accurate decision making in the current wide range of therapeutic options. Despite this promise, only in chronic lymphocytic leukemia the detection of TP53 mutations and/or del17p currently have a direct effect on treatment decisions. Nevertheless, it is expected that in the near future the role of genetic testing will increase for prediction of response to targeted treatment as well as for more accurate prediction of prognosis in indolent B-cell lymphomas.",

In turn, this could lead to misinterpretation of the patient's response to antiplatelet therapy and a less accurate prediction of the patient's risk of thrombotic events during follow-up. We aimed to evaluate the effect of stent implantation on PR in patients with and without acute coronary syndromes who undergo PCI to assess the optimal timing of PR measurements.

Ex-vivo AML exhibits a high level of spontaneous apoptosis. Furthermore, relapse for patients achieving remission occurs from minimal residual disease harboured within the BM microenvironment. Taken together, these observations illustrate the importance of the BM microenvironment in sustaining AML. While significant progress has been made elaborating the small-scale genetic mutations and larger-scale chromosomal translocations that contribute to the development of AML and its prognosis in response to treatment, less is understood about the complex microenvironment of the BM, which is known to be a key player in the pathogenesis of the disease. As we look towards future therapies, the consideration that the BM microenvironment is uniquely important as a niche for AML - coupled with the idea that leukaemic blasts are more likely to be genetically unstable and therefore evolve resistance to conventional chemotherapies - make the functions of the non-malignant cells of the BM attractive targets for therapy. In this review, we discuss the microanatomy of the BM and provide an overview of the evidence supporting the role of the BM microenvironment in creating conditions conducive to the survival and proliferation of AML blasts. Ultimately, we examine the therapeutic potential of uncoupling AML from the BM microenvironment.",

The dysfunction of autophagy proteins hamper the correct erythroid maturation, leading to anemia, the release of immature cells from the bone marrow and other hematological abnormalities. Autophagy plays different roles depending on the type of pathology. In leukemia cells, it has been demonstrated that autophagy could be either detrimental, leading to an increase of the apoptosis rate, or protective, acting as a key process that augments proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Thus, understanding the relationship between autophagy and erythropoiesis opens new avenues for the discovery of biochemical and pharmacological targets and for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

Patients are treated with regular infusions of FVIII concentrate. In response to treatment, approximately 30% of patients with severe hemophilia A develop inhibitory antibodies targeting FVIII. Both patient and treatment related risk factors for inhibitor development have been described. Multiple studies comparing the immunogenicity of recombinant and plasma-derived FVIII have yielded conflicting results. The randomized controlled SIPPET (Survey of Inhibitors in Plasma-Product Exposed Toddlers) trial demonstrated an increased risk of inhibitor development of recombinant FVIII when compared to von Willebrand factor (VWF)-containing plasma-derived FVIII. Presently, it is unclear which mechanism underlies the reduced immunogenicity of plasma-derived FVIII. In this review we address the potential role of VWF on FVIII immunogenicity and we discuss how VWF affects the immune recognition, processing and presentation of FVIII. We also briefly discuss the potential impact of glycan-composition on FVIII immunogenicity. It is well established that VWF shields the uptake of FVIII by antigen presenting cells. We have recently shown that VWF binds to the surface of dendritic cells. Here, we present a novel model in which surface bound FVIII-VWF complexes regulate the internalization of FVIII. Binding of FVIII to VWF is critically dependent on sulfation of Tyr1699 (HVGS numbering) in the light chain of FVIII. Incomplete sulfation of Tyr1699 has been suggested to occur in several recombinant FVIII products resulting in a loss of VWF binding. We hypothesize that this results in alternative pathways of FVIII internalization by antigen presenting cells which are not regulated by VWF. This hypothetical mechanism may explain the reduced immunogenicity of VWF containing plasma-derived FVIII concentrates as found in the SIPPET study.",

The day 14 marrow is used to document hypocellularity in response to induction chemotherapy, but it is unclear if that assessment is necessary as it often does not affect immediate management. Currently, response assessments performed at count recovery for evaluation of remission and measurable residual disease rely on bone marrow sampling.

A significant proportion of DLBCL patients benefit from rituximab-based chemoimmunotherapy. However, among patients with DLBCL toxic effects due to therapy treatment are still very frequent, as well as inter-individual differences in the outcomes of patients even having similar stage, histological grade and histopathological type of the tumor.The present paper reviews the actual status of pharmacogenomics studies concerning gene polymorphisms that may affect response and tolerability to R-CHOP therapeutic regimen used to treat DLBCL. There are clear evidences that polymorphisms of genes codifying for protein are involved in cytotoxicity induced by R-CHOP regimen. Moreover, polymorphisms in genes encoding TNF-superfamily cytokines and proteins involved in controlling cellular cycle and tumor growth may be related to variability in efficacy of R-CHOP therapy in DLBCL patients.This knowledge emphasizes the clinical meaning and importance of pharmacogenetics in oncology. The main merit of our study seems to have tried for the first time a comprehensive review of gene polymorphisms that are involved in the response to an entire therapeutic protocol, R-CHOP, in a specific disease, DLBCL, rather than examining polymorphisms referred to individual drugs among themselves not connected or used to treat different pathological conditions. Indeed, it seems clear that only the analysis of a constellation of polymorphisms can really be useful in clinical practice, while knowledge of a single polymorphism seems to give a limited contribution to our ability to use genetic analysis to the management of patients with malignant blood disorders.",

Splenectomy continues to provide the highest cure rate, but it is an invasive, irreversible treatment option with a downside of postoperative complications and a largely unpredictable outcome. Careful selection of patients, widespread adoption of a laparoscopic approach, perioperative thromboprophylaxis, and better approaches to prevent and mitigate sepsis have however reduced morbidity and mortality. As in ITP, splenectomy is considered the standard second-line treatment in warm AIHA as well, although its position is nowadays less robust as rituximab tends to reach approximately the same success rate in second-line treatment. The role of splenectomy in TTP has never been clarified. Although rituximab is forwarded as best second-line therapy in recent guidelines, there are some case series suggesting that splenectomy is a safe and effective option in refractory or relapsing disease as well.",

Functional immunity effectively contains such latent infections; however, CMV reactivation may cause significant complications in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). In spite of the universal implementation of post-transplant screening for CMV viremia and the institution of pre-emptive antiviral management, CMV disease still occurs in a small portion of patients. Moreover, interactions between CMV and the immune system have significant implications for the incidence of graft-versus-host disease, the recurrence of malignancy, and non-relapse mortality following alloHCT, even in the era of pre-emptive antiviral management. CMV serostatus thus remains an important consideration for patients undergoing alloHCT. We review the clinical impact of CMV in the setting of alloHCT, interactions between CMV serostatus, viral reactivation, and transplant outcomes, as well as current and evolving strategies for prevention and treatment of CMV-related complications that may have significant impact for alloHCT recipients.",

Patients with hematological malignancies undergoing conventional chemotherapy, autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are considered at high risk, and Aspergillus spp. represents the most frequently isolated micro-organisms. In the last years, attention has also been focused on other rare molds (e.g., Zygomycetes, Fusarium spp.) responsible for devastating clinical manifestations. The extensive use of antifungal prophylaxis has reduced the infections from yeasts (e.g., candidemia) even though they are still associated with high mortality rates.This paper analyzes concurrent multiple predisposing factors that could favor the onset of fungal infections. Although neutropenia is common to almost all hematologic patients, other factors play a key role in specific patients, in particular in patients with AML or allogeneic HSCT recipients.

MDSCs are increased in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and have bidirectional interaction with tumors within the MM microenvironment. MM-MDSCs promote MM tumor growth and induce immune suppression; conversely, MM cells induce MDSC development and survival. Although the role of MDSCs in infections, inflammatory diseases and solid tumors has been extensively characterized, their tumor-promoting and immune-suppressive role in MM and the MM microenvironment is only beginning to emerge. The presence and activation of MDSCs in MM patients has been well documented; however, the direct actions and functional consequences of MDSCs on cancer cells is poorly defined. Immunosuppressive MDSCs play an important role in tumor progression primarily because of their capability to promote immune-escape, angiogenesis, drug resistance and metastasis. However, their role in the bone marrow (BM), the primary MM site, is poorly understood. MM remains an incurable malignancy, and it is likely that the BM microenvironment protects MM against chemotherapy agents and the host immune system. A growing body of evidence suggests that host immune cells with a suppressive phenotype contribute to a myeloma immunosuppressive network. Among the known suppressor cells, MDSCs and T regulatory cells (Tregs) have been found to be significantly increased in myeloma patients and their levels correlate with disease stage and clinical outcome. Furthermore, it has been shown that MDSC can mediate suppression of myeloma-specific T-cell responses through the induction of T-cell anergy and Treg development in the MM microenvironment. Here, we review clinical correlations and the preclinical proof-of-principle data on the role of MDSCs in myeloma immunotolerance and highlight the mechanistically relevant MDSC-targeted compounds and their potential utility in a new approach for anti-myeloma therapy.",

Primary haematological prophylaxis, currently the gold standard for the treatment of haemophilia, is not completely effective. Moreover, it is only available for 25\u201330% of patients worldwide. Advances in haematology, combined with the advances in orthopaedic surgery and other disciplines (physical medicine and rehabilitation, physiotherapy, specialised nursing, etc.), have made it possible to improve the musculo-skeletal manifestations of haemophilia in these patients through orthopaedic surgical interventions. These interventions are safe, even in the most complex cases, such as patients who develop inhibitors (antibodies to clotting factor) or are HIV\u00a0+ and HCV\u00a0+. The risk of bleeding in surgical interventions is higher for people with haemophilia than for other patients and there is also a greater risk of infection. Both these factors increase the risk of a poor outcome.

The pathophysiology of this condition is complex. In the recent years there is growing evidence that damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of DIC. Upon cell-death and/or cell activation of hematopoietic and parenchymal cells extracellular cell-free DNA as well as DNA binding proteins (e.g. histones and high mobility group box 1 protein [HMGB1]) are released into circulation. This release is a highly regulated process mediated among others by serine proteases, such as factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) and DNase1. Circulating cell-free DNA has been demonstrated to influence primary and secondary hemostasis by inducing platelet aggregation, promoting coagulation activation, inhibition of fibrinolysis and directly interfering with clot stability. In this respect cell-free DNA in tissue as well as released into the circulation after neutrophil activation in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been shown to be cytotoxic and highly procoagulant. DNA-binding proteins such as histones and HMGB1 are also strongly procoagulant and are involved in the pathogenesis of DIC.

One-stop hybrid FDG-PET/CT combines the functional and morphologic information, outperforming both, CT and FDG-PET as separate imaging modalities. This has resulted in several recommendations using FDG-PET/CT for staging, restaging, monitoring during therapy, and assessment of treatment response as well as identification of malignant transformation. FDG-PET/CT may obviate the need for a bone marrow biopsy in patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. FDG-PET/CT response assessment is recommended for FDG-avid lymphomas, whereas CT-based response evaluation remains important in lymphomas with low or variable FDG avidity. The treatment induced change in metabolic activity allows for assessment of response after completion of therapy as well as prediction of outcome early during therapy. The five-point scale Deauville Criteria allows the assessment of treatment response based on visual FDG-PET analysis. Although the use of FDG-PET/CT for prediction of therapeutic response is promising it should only be conducted in the context of clinical trials. Surveillance FDG-PET/CT after complete remission is discouraged due to the relative high number of false-positive findings, which in turn may result in further unnecessary investigations. Future directions include the use of new PET tracers such as F-18 fluorothymidine (FLT), a surrogate biomarker of cellular proliferation and Ga-68 CXCR4, a chemokine receptor imaging biomarker as well as innovative digital PET/CT and PET/MRI techniques.",

Concern for anthracycline-related cardiotoxicity often leads to dose reductions or use of second-line regimens, which may adversely impact survival. Development of cardiotoxicity depends on a combination of cumulative dose modulated by individual patient characteristics, which we have termed individual cardiotoxic threshold (ICT). Patients with cancer often have characteristics such as age, gender, genetic predisposition and preexisting cardiovascular disease that can potentiate cardiotoxicity. Specialty cardiovascular assessment, more sensitive monitoring technology, and timely interventions in selected patients can decrease cardiotoxicity and improve patient outcomes. Prophylaxis with cardioprotective agents and other strategies have shown promising results in randomized trials and may improve tolerance to anthracyclines.

RAGE ligands are expressed and secreted by tumor cells and are associated with poorer outcomes in a wide variety of tumors. In addition RAGE has been identified on human platelets and RAGE ligands may contribute to platelet activation. Therefore in the tumor microenvironment, upon activation, activated platelets interact with tumor cells through paracrine signaling and direct contact, thereby promoting tumor cell growth and thrombosis. Therefore, according to what is mentioned in this article, RAGE expression and its ligands could be a useful serological biomarker for diagnosis and treatment of cancer, as well as molecular target for novel forms of therapies.",

PTCL consists of numerous distinct entities and is currently diagnosed using a combination of clinical and morphologic features and immunophenotyping together with limited molecular assays leading to an often fragmented, complicated diagnostic system. The diagnosis of many cases is challenging even for expert hematopathologists and more than a third of the cases cannot be further classified and thus put into the PTCL\u2013NOS category. Gene expression profiling (GEP) has significantly improved the molecular classification of PTCLs and identified robust molecular signatures for common nodal subtypes of PTCL including angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic T-cell lymphoma (ALCL), adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) and extra-nodal NK/T cell lymphoma (ENKTL). These studies also led to identification of novel molecular subtypes with distinct prognosis, that otherwise could not be identified by conventional methods. Integration of massive sequencing strategies and gene expression has characterized driver genetic alterations in common subtypes like AITL, ALCL, ENKTL and other PTCLs. These studies have identified oncogenic pathways and genes affected in specific disease subtypes that can be potentially targeted by specific therapies. Novel treatment options with FDA approved drugs directed towards mutant IDH2, the NF-\u03baB, JAK/STAT, or mTOR pathways illustrate the usefulness of genome-wide techniques to identify targets for therapy.

Reliable assays of these mutations have already entered the clinic and efforts are currently ongoing to formally incorporate mutational analysis into the existing clinicopathologic risk stratification tools. Additionally, mutational analysis holds promise for going beyond prognostication to therapeutic selection and individualized treatment-specific prediction of outcomes; abilities that would revolutionize MDS patient care.

Reasons for this include lack of sensitivity/specificity of current screening methods, lack of reliable screening tests for some pathogens (e.g. prions) and the fact that many potentially harmful infectious agents are not routinely screened for. Methods for the purification/inactivation of blood/plasma-derived products have been developed in order to further reduce the residual risk, but low concentrations of pathogens do not necessarily imply a low level of risk for the patient and so the overall challenge of minimising risk remains. This review aims to discuss the variable level of pathogenic risk and describes the current screening methods used to prevent/detect the presence of pathogens in blood/plasma-derived products.",

This latter frequently consists of a combination of cytarabine and anthracyclines, although etoposide, demethylating agents, and other drugs are also used. Unfortunately, chemoresistance is a common and serious problem. Multiple mechanisms account for impaired effectiveness of drugs and reduced levels of active agents in target cells. The latter can be due to lower drug uptake, increased export or decreased intracellular proportion of active/inactive agent due to changes in the expression/function of enzymes responsible for the activation of pro-drugs and the inactivation of active agents. Characterization of the \u201cresistome\u201d, or profile of expressed genes accounting for multi-drug resistance (MDR) phenotype, would permit to predict the lack of response to chemotherapy and would help in the selection of the best pharmacological regime for each patient and moment, and to develop strategies of chemosensitization.",

The correction of this anemia is usually achieved by treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and iron (oral or intravenous). Studies questioning the safety of ESAs (especially at higher doses) changed the pattern of anemia treatment in CKD patients. According to the new guidelines, when transferrin saturation is lower than 30% and ferritin lower than 500\u00a0ng/mL, a trial with iron should be started, to avoid therapy with ESAs or at least to reduce the doses needed to treat the anemia. Recent reports showed increasing ferritin levels, towards values above 800\u00a0ng/mL, in CKD patients treated according to the guidelines. In this review we focus on the risks of the increased iron use to treat CKD anemia, namely, iron overload and toxicity, increased risk of infections, as well as mortality.",

Regularly, strongly positive DAT scores are encountered with no sign of hemolysis, while severe hemolysis can be seen even in patients with a negative DAT score. Apparently, the mere amount of antibody is not the sole predictor of disease. In this paper, we review the current literature on aspects of both the autoantibodies and the patients' clearance system that together determine the clinical significance of an anti-RBC autoantibody, ranging from antibody isotype to antibody Fc-glycosylation to alternative clearance mechanisms.

The introduction of high-dose melphalan followed by autologous haematopoietic cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) for young patients and the availability of novel agents for young and elderly patients with multiple myeloma have dramatically changed the perspective of treatment. However, further research is necessary if we want to definitively cure the disease. Treatment goals for transplant-eligible and non-transplant-eligible patients should be to prolong survival by achieving the best possible response, while ensuring quality of life. The treatment should be individualized on the basis of host and disease features and better monitoring of the response upon use of high-sensitivity techniques for evaluating residual disease.For young patients, HDT/ASCT is a standard of care for treatment and its efficacy has been enhanced and challenged by the new drugs. For elderly patients, treatment options were limited to alkylators, but new upfront treatment combinations based on novel agents (proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory drugs) combined or not with alkylators have significantly improved outcomes.Extended treatment for young and elderly patients improves the quality and duration of clinical responses; however, the optimal scheme, appropriate doses and duration of long-term therapy have not yet been fully determined.This review summarises the progress in the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, addressing critical questions such as the optimal induction, early versus late ASCT, consolidation and/or maintenance for young patients, and how we can choose the best option for non-transplant-eligible patients.",

The etiology of anemia predominates from ineffective erythropoiesis from marrow infiltration, cytokine related suppression, erythropoietin suppression, and vitamin deficiency; ineffective erythropoiesis is further exacerbated by accelerated clearance due to antibody mediated hemolysis and thrombotic microangiopathy. As the anemia is chronic in nature, symptoms are generally well tolerated and often non-specific. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a balance between providing benefit for patients while avoiding risks of transfusion. Conservative/restrictive RBC transfusion practices have shown equivalent patient outcomes compared to liberal transfusion practices, and meta-analysis has shown improved in-hospital mortality, reduced cardiac events, re-bleeding, and bacterial infections. The implications for a lower threshold for transfusion in patients with malignancies are therefore increasingly being scrutinized. Alternative management strategies for anemia with IV iron and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) should be considered in the appropriate settings.",

This is highly effective at controlling and preventing haemorrhage and its associated complications.

In contrast, gene therapy for haemophilia offers the potential of a cure as a result of continuous endogenous expression of biologically active factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX) proteins following stable transfer of a normal copy of the respective gene. Our group has recently established the first clear proof-of-concept for a gene therapy approach to the treatment of severe haemophilia B. This entails a single intravenous administration of an adeno-associated virus vector encoding an optimised FIX gene, resulting in a long-term (>\u00a04\u00a0years) dose dependent increase in plasma FIX levels at therapeutic levels without persistent or late toxicity. Gene therapy therefore has the potential to change the treatment paradigm for haemophilia but several hurdles need to be overcome before this can happen.

Current understanding of the roles of platelet activation and thrombin generation/activity in vascular medicine has led to the development of effective antithrombotic treatments. However, in parallel with a sustained coronary and cerebral flow patency, the increasingly intensive treatment with warfarin; direct oral anticoagulant drugs [DOACs], and/or with aspirin\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0clopidogrel (or \u00b1\u00a0prasugrel or \u00b1\u00a0ticagrelor), has increased the burden of GIBs related to the use of antithrombotic agents. Compelling evidence concerning this issue is accumulating to indicate that: 1) the risk of GIB related to the use of antithrombotic drugs dramatically differs in different clinical settings; and 2) the characteristics of patients (e.g., severity of illness, comorbidities) in whom it is used exert a greater impact on the risk of GIB than the type of antithrombotic agent employed. The latter concept argues for the occurrence of GIB as reflecting the presence of patients at the highest risk for adverse outcomes. The HAS-BLED score identifies subjects at risk of bleeding among those untreated and those treated with warfarin, DOACs and/or low-dose aspirin. Its use within the frame of a severity score (e.g., the CHA2DS2-VASc score in patients with atrial fibrillation) helps balance the benefits and the risks of an antithrombotic treatment and identify those patients in whom the absolute gain (vascular events prevented) outweighs the risk of GIB.

However, the results of clinical trials have been overall disappointing. In this review we discuss the mechanism of retinoic acid signaling and the results of major clinical trials that have attempted to incorporate ATRA into AML regimens. We discuss recent evidence that indicate that the retinoic acid signaling pathway may be dysfunctional in AML. Preliminary studies suggest that targeting the pathways that modify retinoic acid receptor activity may reactivate the dormant retinoic acid-signaling pathway. Such strategies may revive the ability of ATRA to induce myeloid differentiation and apoptosis in non-APL AML.",

Management of relapsed/refractory MCL requires an individualized treatment approach, incorporating factors such as: functional status, prior treatments, response to prior therapies, and disease biology. Generally, there are two categories of salvage therapy; the first, non-cross-resistant cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents and, the second, pathway-targeted agents. For transplant eligible patients, the optimal therapy usually consists of salvage, remission re-induction phase followed, whenever possible, by a consolidation phase. Bendamustine and/or high dose cytarabine plus rituximab based chemotherapy represent the most common salvage therapy with an overall response rate of 70\u201380%. Consolidation with a reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation represents the only potentially curative treatment. Overall survival ranges from 30% to 50% at 5\u00a0years with this approach. For transplant ineligible patients, ibrutinib is the most effective treatment with an overall response rate of almost 70% and median response duration of 17.5\u00a0months. Lacking an effective consolidation, this approach is not considered curative. In this review we characterize the main therapeutic approaches available in this setting and summarize our preferred clinical treatment approach.",

Apparently, various durations and intensities of exercise have different effects on haemostasis and especially high intensity exercise tends to increase the risk of thrombotic events. However, the mechanisms behind this have not been entirely established. In this review we provide an overview of the various effects of the different intensities and durations of exercise on haemostasis. Overall, the haemostatic profile is mainly affected by the intensity of exercise; and is more pronounced after high (>\u00a080%) compared to low intensity (<\u00a060%), as reflected by increased platelet and coagulant activity.

Historically, overcoming the HLA-incompatibility barrier has been a significant limitation to the expansion of this form of transplant. While ex vivo T-cell depletion effectively prevented the development of acute GVHD, it was associated with a higher treatment-related mortality, in excess of 40% in some series, due to a significant delay in recovery of the adaptive immune system. Newer methods have successfully maintained the memory T cells in the graft and/or selectively depleted alloreactive T cells, and are associated with improved treatment outcomes. Post-transplant cyclophosphamide for GVHD prevention has proven very effective in controlling GVHD with lower incidence of infectious complications and treatment-related mortality\u2014as low as 7% at 1 year\u2014and has become the new standard in how this transplant is performed.

Metabolic syndrome affects 1 in 4 adults in the United States and is rapidly rising in prevalence, largely driven by the dramatic rise in obesity and insulin resistance/DM. Being central to the development of metabolic syndrome and its other related diseases, much focus has been placed on identifying the mitogenic effects of obesity and insulin resistance/DM as mechanistic clues of the link between metabolic syndrome and cancer. Pertinent mechanisms identified include altered lipid signaling, adipokine and inflammatory cytokine effects, and activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MAPK/ERK pathways via dysregulated insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling. Through variable activation of these multiple pathways, obesity and insulin resistance/DM pre-dispose to hematologic malignancies, imposing the aggressive and chemo-resistant phenotypes typically seen in cancer patients with underlying metabolic syndrome. Growing understanding of these pathways has identified druggable cancer targets, rationalizing the development and testing of agents like PI3K inhibitor idelalisib, mTOR inhibitors everolimus and temsirolimus, and IGF-1 receptor inhibitor linsitinib. It has also led to exploration of obesity and diabetes-directed therapies including statins and oral hypoglycemic for the management of metabolic syndrome-related hematologic neoplasms.",

Laboratory studies indicate that the net effect of changes in hemostasis in many patients with chronic liver disease is a hypercoagulable status. In turn, clinical thrombosis is increasingly recognized as a complication of liver disease. When occurring within the liver, thrombosis may even progress the disease course. Exciting preliminary data regarding the potential of low-molecular-weight heparin to slow down the progression of liver disease indicate that this class of drugs may improve outcome without a major increase in bleeding risk. However, this new era for antithrombotic therapy in chronic liver disease is still hindered by a persistent false notion that patients with cirrhosis are \u201cauto-anticoagulated\u201d by their underlying liver disease. In addition, there is insufficient clinical evidence on safety and efficacy of anticoagulant therapy in cirrhosis and the studies conducted so far are limited by small sample sizes, uncontrolled treatment arms, or by their retrospective nature.

Despite the enormous progress in anti-tumor efficacy achieved during the last decades, the development of multidrug resistance (MDR) remains a major challenge in the successful treatment of hematological malignancies. Extensive investigations have discovered diverse mechanisms underlying MDR. More recently, increasing evidence demonstrates that miRNAs play a key regulatory role in MDR in hematological malignancies through modulating drug transporter-related proteins, cell cycle-related proteins, drug targets, autophagy, tumor microenvironment, cell survival signaling and apoptosis pathways. Pre-clinical evidence suggests that miRNAs may prove to be an ideal biomarker for predicting drug response or clinical outcomes, thus holding much promise for the development of targeted therapies and personalized medicines for the treatment of hematological malignancies. This review focuses on molecular mechanisms underlying miRNA-mediated chemoresistance in hematological malignancies and discusses evidence of transitional research aiming to bring drug resistance-associated miRNAs into clinical settings.",

The difficulties in diagnosis are mainly due to the non-specific presenting features of CVT, which can range from isolated headache and visual or auditory problems, to serious symptoms such as hemiparesis and coma. Therefore, it can present to various specialists including general physicians, obstetricians and neurologists. In recent years, more widespread use of cerebral imaging has led to the diagnosis being made more often. Since thrombosis is the key component, haematologists are consulted in the management of these patients including for identification of a causative factor for CVT. In this regard, the pivotal International Study on Cerebral Vein and Dural Sinus Thrombosis (ISCVT) has shed more light on its epidemiology and management options. This review aims to provide guidance to haematologists when faced with a patient with CVT, based on the currently available evidence.",

This review focuses on mechanisms in non-antibody mediated TRALI which includes soluble mediators accumulating during storage of red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets (PLTs), as well as changes in morphology and function of aged PLTs and RBCs. These mediators cause TRALI in two-hit animal models and have been implicated in TRALI onset in clinical studies. Pre-clinical studies show a clear relation between TRALI and increased storage time of cellular blood products. Observational clinical studies however report conflicting data.

     "abstract": "Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) was initially developed to treat bleeding episodes in patients with congenital haemophilia and inhibitors. The story of its development began in the 1970s, when FVIIa was identified as one of the activated coagulation factors that has minimal potential for inducing thromboembolic side-effects. Extensive research over the last 30 years has greatly increased our knowledge of the characteristics of FVII, its activation, and the mechanisms by which rFVIIa restores haemostasis. In haemophilia, the haemostatic effect of rFVIIa is mediated via binding to thrombin-activated platelets at the site of injury, thereby enhancing thrombin generation also in the absence of factor (F) VIII or FIX. The mechanism of action of rFVIIa has also allowed its successful use in other clinical scenarios characterised by impaired thrombin generation, and its licensed uses have now been extended to acquired haemophilia, congenital FVII deficiency and Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.",

Recombinant FVIIa is licensed for the on-demand treatment of bleeding episodes and the prevention of bleeding in surgery or invasive procedures in patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors. This article attempts to review in detail the extensive evidence of rFVIIa in congenital haemophilia patients with inhibitors. Patients with acute bleeding episodes are best treated on demand at home, to achieve the short- and long-term benefits of rapid bleed control. Key prospective studies have shown that rFVIIa achieves consistently high efficacy rates in the management of acute (including joint) bleeds in inhibitor patients in the home treatment setting. Substantial post-approval data from key registries also support the on-demand efficacy profile of rFVIIa established by the prospective clinical trials. The availability of rFVIIa has allowed major surgery to become a reality for inhibitor patients. Studies in key surgery, including orthopaedic procedures, have found that rFVIIa provides consistently high efficacy rates. Importantly, the wealth of data does not raise any unexpected safety concerns surrounding rFVIIa use; this is likely because rFVIIa is a recombinant product with a localised mechanism of action at the site of vascular injury. In summary, rFVIIa is established as an effective and well-tolerated first-line treatment for on-demand bleeding control and bleed prevention during minor and major (including elective orthopaedic) surgery in inhibitor patients. Use of rFVIIa has been a major step towards narrowing the gap in outcomes between inhibitor patients and non-inhibitor patients.",

Observational studies offer crucial insight into the disease and its treatment. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, eptacog alfa activated) was available on an emergency and compassionate use basis from 1988 to 1999 at sites in Europe and North America. In 1996, rFVIIa was approved in Europe for the treatment of AH; it was licensed for this indication in the United States in 2006. Recombinant activated FVII is approved for first-line treatment of bleeding episodes and prevention of bleeding in surgical/invasive procedures in patients with AH. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the haemostatic efficacy of rFVIIa in patients with AH, from the first emergency and compassionate use programmes, to patient registries and a post-marketing surveillance study. In acute bleeding episodes, rFVIIa provided high and consistent rates of control, and available data showed that acute bleed control rates were higher for first-line rFVIIa versus salvage rFVIIa. In surgical procedures, rFVIIa also provided high rates of control. In patients with AH, rFVIIa has a high rate of haemostatic efficacy in acute and surgical bleeding episodes.",

The frequency of these disorders in the general population ranges from 1:500,000 to 1:2,000,000. Because GT and FVII CD are both rare, registries are the only approach possible to allow the collection and analysis of sufficient observational data. Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa, eptacog alfa activated) is indicated for the treatment of acute bleeding episodes and for surgery coverage in patients with GT who are refractory to platelets and have antiplatelet or anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies, and for the prevention and treatment of bleeding in patients with FVII CD. This article summarises published data on the mechanism of action and use of rFVIIa in these disorders from two international, prospective, observational registries: the Glanzmann's Thrombasthenia Registry (GTR) for GT; and the Seven Treatment Evaluation Registry (STER) for FVII CD. Haemostatic effectiveness rates with rFVIIa were high across all patients with GT and those with FVII CD, and treatment with rFVIIa in the GTR and STER registries was well tolerated. The GTR and the STER are the largest collections of data in GT and FVII CD, respectively, and have expanded our knowledge of the management of these two rare bleeding disorders.",

Accumulated data up to 31 December 2013 from clinical trials as well as post-marketing data (registries, literature reports and spontaneous reports) were included. Overall, rFVIIa has shown a consistently favourable safety profile, with no unexpected safety concerns, in all approved indications. No confirmed cases of neutralising antibodies against rFVIIa have been reported in patients with congenital haemophilia, acquired haemophilia or Glanzmann's thrombasthenia. The favourable safety profile of rFVIIa can be attributed to the recombinant nature of rFVIIa and its localised mechanism of action at the site of vascular injury. Recombinant FVIIa activates factor X directly on the surface of activated platelets, which are present only at the site of injury, meaning that systemic activation of coagulation is avoided and the risk of thrombotic events (TEs) thus reduced. Nonetheless, close monitoring for signs and symptoms of TE is warranted in all patients treated with any pro-haemostatic agent, including rFVIIa, especially the elderly and any other patients with concomitant conditions and/or predisposing risk factors to thrombosis.",

From these numbers, it seems that CTEPH itself is the extreme manifestation of a much more common phenomenon of permanent changes in pulmonary artery flow, pulmonary gas exchange and/or cardiac function caused by the acute PE and associated with dyspnea and decreased exercise capacity, which in analogy to post-thrombotic syndrome after deep vein thrombosis could be referred to as the post-pulmonary embolism syndrome. The acknowledgement of this syndrome would both be relevant for daily clinical practice and also provide a concept that aids in further understanding of the pathophysiology of CTEPH. In this clinically oriented review, we discuss the established associations and hypotheses between the process of thrombus resolution or persistence, lasting hemodynamic changes following acute PE as well as the consequences of a PE diagnosis on long-term physical performance and quality of life.",

In this review we summarize recent knowledge gained on the immune recognition and processing of ADAMTS13 by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). HLA-DRB1*11 has been identified as a risk factor for acquired TTP. Analysis of MHC class II/peptide complexes of ADAMTS13 pulsed dendritic cells have shown that the CUB2 domain derived peptide FINVAPHAR is preferentially presented on HLA-DRB1*11. Based on these findings we propose a model for the initiation of the autoimmune reactivity against ADAMTS13 in previously healthy individuals. We hypothesize that mimicry between a pathogen-derived peptide and the CUB2 derived FINVAPHAR-peptide might contribute to the onset of acquired TTP.",

However, the large majority of patients with sickle cell disease will not have such a donor, or will not be able to tolerate high dose conditioning regimens. Therefore novel approaches such as non-myeloablative regimes, and alternative donors such as haploidentical, unrelated, or cord blood grafts are currently being explored in clinical trials. Recent reports on non-myeloablative conditioning (HLA-matched or haploidentical donors) highlight the safety and efficacy of these approaches with low mortality and high efficacy suggesting that in the near future non-myeloablation could be the preferred type of conditioning and donor availability will not be a barrier anymore to proceed to transplant.

The former is among a small group of cancers exceptional for being (nearly) unified by a single genetic lesion, the BRAF V600E mutation. Over the past three decades, tremendous progress in both diagnostic and prognostic clarification has been accompanied by therapeutic advances in classical HCL. Consequently, this once uniformly fatal disease has been converted in most cases into a chronic illness enabling patients to live long and productive lives. In response to standard therapy, patients have high complete remission rates. Unfortunately, the long-term survival curves have not plateaued, revealing that this disease is controlled but not cured. Though rare and representing only about 10% of an already rare disease, those patients with the variant fare exceptionally poorly with standard therapy: complete response rates to purine nucleoside analogs are reported to be less than 50%, whereas the complete response rates in classical HCL are up to 90%. Novel small molecules targeting BRAF and the B-cell receptor signaling complex, and biologic agents like antibodies and immunotoxin conjugates are being explored for those patients who have relapsed. Substantial opportunities for continued research remain. This complex and multi-faceted disease incorporates challenges from altered immunity associated with the underlying disease and its treatments.

Patients diagnosed with indolent lymphoma may often be just followed, whereas those presenting with aggressive or highly aggressive disease need to be urgently treated with chemoimmunotherapy, either after undergoing an elective pregnancy termination if diagnosed at an early gestational stage, or with pregnancy preservation, if diagnosed later.Supportive care of NHL is also important; however, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) which is commonly used outside of pregnancy, should be cautiously employed, considering its established teratogenicity in animals, though this is less proven in humans.

HLH represents the extreme end of a severe uncontrolled hyperinflammatory reaction that can occur in many underlying conditions. Genetic forms of HLHs are due to defects in transport, processing and function of cytotoxic granules in natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and are not restricted to manifestation in childhood. Acquired forms of HLH are encountered in infections, autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases, malignancies, acquired immune deficiency. Functional tests allow for differentiation between genetic and acquired HLH. Treatment aims at suppressing hypercytokinemia and eliminating activated and infected cells. It includes immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive agents, cytostatics, T-cell and cytokine antibodies. In genetic HLH cure can only be achieved with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Reduced-intensity conditioning regimens have considerably improved survival.",

It is broadly expressed on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and, possibly, some leukemic stem cells and has therefore been exploited as target for therapeutic antibodies for many years. The improved survival seen in many patients when the antibody-drug conjugate, gemtuzumab ozogamicin, is added to conventional chemotherapy validates this approach. However, many attempts with unconjugated or conjugated antibodies have been unsuccessful, highlighting the challenges of targeting CD33 in AML. With the development of improved immunoconjugates and CD33-directed strategies that harness immune effector cells, therapeutics with enhanced efficacy may soon become available. Toxic effects on normal hematopoietic cells may increase in parallel with this increased efficacy and demand new supportive care measures, including possibly rescue with donor cells, to minimize morbidity and mortality from drug-induced cytopenias and to optimize treatment outcomes with these agents in patients with AML.",

     "abstract": "There is increasing research on and clinical interest in the physiological role played by platelet microparticles (PMPs). PMPs are 0.1\u20131-\u03bcm fragments shed from plasma membranes of platelets that are undergoing activation, stress, or apoptosis. They have a phospholipid-based structure and express functional receptors from platelet membranes. As they are the most abundant microparticles in the blood and they express the procoagulant phosphatidylserine, PMPs likely complement, if not amplify, the functions of platelets in hemostasis, thrombosis, cancer, and inflammation, but also act as promoters of tissue regeneration. Their size and structure make them instrumental in platelet\u2013cell communications as a delivery tool of platelet-borne bioactive molecules including growth factors, other signaling molecules and micro (mi)RNA. PMPs can therefore be a pathophysiological threat or benefit to the cellular environment when interacting with the blood vasculature. There is also increasing evidence that PMP generation is triggered during blood collection, separation into components, and storage, a phenomenon potentially leading to thrombotic and inflammatory side effects in transfused patients. Evaluating PMPs requires strict pre-analytical and analytical procedures to avoid artifactual generation and ensure accurate assessment of the number, size repartitioning, and functional properties. This review describes the physical and functional methods developed for analyzing and quantifying PMPs. It then presents the functional roles of PMPs as markers or triggers of diseases like thrombosis, atherosclerosis, and cancer, and discusses the possible detrimental immunological impact of their generation in blood components. Finally we review the potential function of PMPs in tissue regeneration and the prospects for their use in therapeutic strategies for human health.",

Most studies showed an association between high VWF levels and arterial thrombosis. It remains unclear whether ADAMTS13 is a causal independent risk factor because the association between low ADAMTS13 and arterial thrombosis is so far only shown in case-control studies.

These include Jak-Stat, Mapk, Pi3k-Akt, sphingolipid, and IL-15/Pdgf signaling.

The clinical value of this risk reduction in comparison to that obtained with warfarin and the new oral anticoagulant agents, should take into account the low risk for bleeding and costs associated with aspirin.

These findings indicate that the intrinsic risk of VTE is higher in men than in women. Hormonal contraceptives increase the risk of VTE and the risk varies per type, dose, and administration route. In women with a high baseline risk of VTE, avoidance of some hormonal contraceptives should be considered, as well as thrombosis prophylaxis during pregnancy. Presence of hereditary thrombophilia increases the risk of a first VTE episode.

A similar sex-related difference in haemoglobin levels in adult animals is found in many species of mammals, birds and reptiles, indicating that it is an important physiological phenomenon. It is probably a direct effect of sex hormones, both oestrogen and androgens, on erythropoiesis. However, since there is no difference in erythropoietin levels between the sexes, this effect most likely takes place in the kidney, rather than in the bone marrow. Oestrogens dilate and androgens constrict the renal microvasculature: dilation and vasoconstriction in vessels below 300\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter respectively increase and decrease the haematocrit in blood in arterioles, capillaries and venules, altering the oxygen delivery per unit red cell mass, and providing a mechanism for varying the red cell mass without compensatory changes in erythropoiesis.",

Infusion of Notch-expanded progenitors shortened myelosuppression in preclinical and early clinical studies, while accelerating T cell reconstitution in preclinical models. Notch also plays an essential role in vivo to regulate pathogenic alloimmune T cells that mediate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the most severe complication of allo-HCT. In mouse allo-HCT models, Notch inhibition in donor-derived T cells or transient blockade of Delta-like ligands after transplantation profoundly decreased GVHD incidence and severity, without causing global immunosuppression.

     "abstract": "The ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) plays a central role in cellular protein homeostasis through the targeted destruction of damaged/misfolded proteins and regulatory proteins that control critical cellular functions. The UPS comprises a sequential series of enzymatic activities to covalently attach ubiquitin to proteins to target them for degradation through the proteasome. Aberrancies within this system have been associated with transformation and tumourigenesis and thus, the UPS represents an attractive target for the development of anti-cancer therapies. The use of the first-in-class proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, in the treatment of Plasma Cell Myeloma and Mantle Cell Lymphoma has validated the UPS as a therapeutic target. Following on its success, efforts are focused on the development of second-generation proteasome inhibitors and small molecule inhibitors of other components of the UPS. This review will provide an overview of the UPS and discuss current and novel therapies targeting the UPS.",

Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, which is available for a minority of patients, efficiently prevents recurrences of leukemia by inducing immune-mediated elimination of leukemic cells, and over the past decades, numerous immunotherapeutic protocols have been developed aiming to mimic the graft-versus-leukemia reaction for the prevention of relapse. Here we review past and present strategies for relapse control with focus on overcoming leukemia-related immunosuppression in AML. We envisage future treatment protocols, in which systemic immune activators, such as vaccines, dendritic cell-based therapies, engineered variants of IL-2, or IL-15, are combined with agents that counter immunosuppression mediated by, e.g., the PD/PDL interaction, CTLA-4, CD200, reactive oxygen species, IDO expression, CXCR4, or the KIR/class I interaction, based on characteristics of the prevailing malignant clone. This combinatorial approach may pave the way for individualized immunotherapy in AML.",

Direct binding of rituximab to a CD20dim T-cell population, inducing its depletion, may contribute to the decreased T-cell activation following rituximab therapy.Further investigation of the complex network through which rituximab and new anti-CD20 MoAbs act, would advance the employment of these agents in different clinical settings.",

Defects in various proteins involved in linking the lipid bilayer to membrane skeleton result in loss in membrane cohesion leading to surface area loss and hereditary spherocytosis while defects in proteins involved in lateral interactions of the spectrin-based skeleton lead to decreased mechanical stability, membrane fragmentation and hereditary elliptocytosis. The disease severity is primarily dependent on the extent of membrane surface area loss.

According to the degree of FVIII deficiency, mild, moderate or severe forms are recognized. Although patients with mild hemophilia A usually bleed excessively only after trauma or surgery, those with severe hemophilia experience frequent episodes of spontaneous or excessive bleeding after minor trauma, particularly into joints and muscles. The modern management of hemophilia began in the 1970s and is actually based upon several plasma-derived or recombinant FVIII products. In addition, the synthetic drug desmopressin can be used to prevent or treat bleeding episodes in patients with mild hemophilia A. Long-term and continuous substitution therapy (prophylaxis), the recommended treatment in severe hemophilia, prevents bleeding and the resultant joint damage. In the last twenty years the high standard of hemophilia care has greatly improved the quality of life of patients and their life expectancy has reached that of the non-hemophilic male population, at least in high-income countries. The most serious and challenging complication of treatment of hemophilia A is the development of inhibitors, which renders FVIII concentrate infusion ineffective and exposes patients to an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.

In atherosclerotic plaques TFPI co-localizes with TF, where it is believed to play an important role in attenuating TF activity. Findings in animal models such as TFPI knockout models and gene transfer models are consistent on the role of TFPI in arterial thrombosis as they reveal an active role for TFPI in attenuating arterial thrombus formation. In addition, ample experimental evidence exists indicating that TFPI has inhibitory effects on both smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation, both which are recognized as important pathological features in atherosclerosis development. Nonetheless, the clinical relevance of these antithrombotic and atheroprotective effects remains unclear. Paradoxically, the majority of clinical studies find increased instead of decreased TFPI antigen and activity levels in atherothrombotic disease, particularly in atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease (CAD). Increased TFPI levels in cardiovascular disease might result from complex interactions with established cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes and smoking. Moreover, it is postulated that increased TFPI levels reflect either the amount of endothelial perturbation and platelet activation, or a compensatory mechanism for the increased procoagulant state observed in cardiovascular disease. In all, the prognostic value of plasma TFPI in cardiovascular disease remains to be established.

A sequential approach, consisting of an induction regimen associated with a high rate of complete response, followed by consolidation/maintenance therapy, induces a profound cytoreduction and delays relapse, thus improving survival. Novel agents associated with reduced-intensity autologous transplant showed to be safe and effective in fit elderly patients. Patients older than 75\u00a0years or vulnerable ones are more susceptible to adverse events that negatively affect treatment adherence and outcome.

Fibrin-based biomaterials, known as fibrin glues or fibrin sealants, have been used for more than 30\u00a0years as surgical hemostatic and sealing agents, demonstrating benefits in essentially all surgical fields, including reconstructive plastic surgery and wound treatment. Clinical interest in platelet growth factor-rich biomaterials (often known as platelet gels or platelet-rich-plasma) has emerged more recently. Platelet gels are used in clinical situations to achieve wound healing and repair soft and hard tissues. Applications include the healing of recalcitrant ulcers and burns, and stimulation of osseous tissue regeneration in dentistry, implantology, and maxillofacial and plastic surgery. They were evaluated recently in knee osteoarthritis and for the repair of musculoskeletal tissue lesions in sports medicine.

     "abstract": "The complex relationship between the inflammatory response and vascular injury and repair is of major importance to the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. CRP is not only a strong marker for cardiovascular morbidity but a modulator that suppresses local and systemic thromboregulatory pathways. In the present review we address the question of whether CRP is involved in atherogenesis, in thrombosis, or in both components of the atherothrombotic process. While CRP is present in the atherosclerotic lesion, it is probably not pro-atherogenic and correlates only minimally with atherogenesis. Alas, CRP promotes thrombus formation and vascular occlusion. Thus, CRP is most likely not affecting atheroma build-up but rather the deleterious process of plaque vulnerability and thrombus formation. Dwelling into CRP mechanism of action may lead to the design of new diagnostic modalities that will add to the predictive value of CRP in identifying those patients at high cardiovascular risk. Furthermore, defining the mechanistic domain is the foundation to the cause\u2013effect detection of possible therapeutic interventions to counter CRP morbid effects.",

     "abstract": "A classic physiologic response to systemic hypoxia is the increase in red blood cell production. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) orchestrate this response by inducing cell-type specific gene expression changes that result in increased erythropoietin (EPO) production in kidney and liver, in enhanced iron uptake and utilization and in adjustments of the bone marrow microenvironment that facilitate erythroid progenitor maturation and proliferation. In particular HIF-2 has emerged as the transcription factor that regulates EPO synthesis in the kidney and liver and plays a critical role in the regulation of intestinal iron uptake. Its key function in the hypoxic regulation of erythropoiesis is underscored by genetic studies in human populations that live at high-altitude and by mutational analysis of patients with familial erythrocytosis. This review provides a perspective on recent insights into HIF-controlled erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, and examines cell types that have EPO-producing capability. Furthermore, the review summarizes clinical syndromes associated with mutations in the O2-sensing pathway and the genetic changes that occur in high altitude natives. The therapeutic potential of pharmacologic HIF activation for the treatment of anemia is discussed.",

However, DLI application is limited by the development of graft-versus-host disease and aplasia, and thus cannot be routinely applied for prophylaxis. Therefore, important questions remain to be answered, such as when, and whom to DLI? Recent advances enable DLI using allografts of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized peripheral blood progenitor cells; allodepleted donor T cells; and infusions of donor-derived, ex vivo-expanded, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocyte, which can decrease relapse and improve transplant outcomes. Preemptive immunotherapy of relapse was also introduced based on the determination of mixed chimerism and minimal residual disease. In this review, we summarize the latest developments in recent strategies that will affect future DLI efficacy \u2014 focusing on the disadvantages and advantages of each protocol for the treatment, preemptive therapy, and prophylaxis of relapse.",

While recent medical advances have led to cure, remission or long-term disease control for patients with hematologic malignancy, many still portend poor prognoses and all are associated with significant symptom and quality of life burden for patients and families. The gravity of a diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy also weighs heavily on the medical team, who typically develop close and long-term relationships with their patients. Palliative care teams provide an additional layer of support to patients, family caregivers, and the primary medical team through close attention to symptoms and emotional, practical, and spiritual needs. Barriers to routine palliative care co-management in hematologic malignancies include persistent health professional confusion about the role of palliative care and its distinction from hospice; inadequate availability of palliative care provider capacity; and widespread lack of physician training in communicating about achievable goals of care with patients, family caregivers, and colleagues. We herein review the evidence of need for palliative care services in hematologic malignancy patients in the context of a growing body of evidence demonstrating the beneficial outcomes of such care when provided simultaneously with curative or life-prolonging treatment.",

However, treatment-related mortality and relapse have remained major barriers to uniform success. Therefore, important questions remain to be answered, such as whom to transplant, when and how. With reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, patients in their 70s and patients with comorbid conditions have been transplanted successfully, although the relapse incidence with this approach tends to be increased in comparison to high intensity regimens. Success rates are higher in patients transplanted at an early stage of their disease. Encouraging is the fact, that results with unrelated donors who are HLA-matched by high resolution typing are comparable to those achieved with HLA genotypically identical siblings. The establishment of cord blood as a source of stem cells, and the recent success with HLA-haploidentical related donors will allow the offering of HCT to virtually all patients.

Failure of this system results in the onset of sepsis leading to grave consequences for the host. Together with mechanical methods to physically isolate and remove the pathogen, neutrophils also release an important set of proinflammatory biological modulators that mediate recruitment of additional cells to a site of infection and amplify the innate protective response. Additionally, neutrophils release highly charged mixtures of DNA and nuclear proteins named neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). These electrostatically-charged adhesive networks trigger intrinsic coagulation, limit dispersion and entrap the pathogens. NETs also contain the neutrophil secretary granule-derived serine proteases, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, known to regulate the reactivity of both neutrophils and platelets. Since the characterization of NETs in 2004, new studies of their functional effect in vivo continue to expand upon unexpected extracellular roles for DNA, and in doing so renew attention to the haemostatic role of the leukocyte.

Especially in patients with severe VWD, joint bleeds have been described in up to 45% of the patients. Recurrent hemarthroses can lead to joint destruction which is the main cause of morbidity, as is observed in hemophilia patients. In VWD however, the occurrence, severity, onset, treatment and impact of arthropathy have not been well described. This literature review summarizes all publications on arthropathy in patients with hereditary VWD, published until 1-5-2012. Joint bleeds in VWD are associated with low FVIII levels and seem to occur at young age. Depending on the severity of VWD, arthropathy occurs in 2\u201330% of the patients. Radiological joint damage can be seen but has not systematically been studied. Arthropathy can affect daily functioning and interfere with the quality of life. For acute management of joint bleeds FVIII/VWF concentrates can be used in VWD patients unresponsive to desmopressin or desmopressin in responsive VWD patients. When severe joint bleeds have caused synovitis and arthropathy, chemical or radioactive synovectomy and surgical joint procedures seem feasible to prevent further joint damage. Additional research is needed to learn more about the severity, onset and impact of arthropathy in VWD. Ongoing studies will hopefully answer the question whether prophylactic treatment with coagulation factor concentrates should be considered standard of care in severe VWD to prevent arthropathy.",

Elevated VWF levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events. Whether this relation is causal, or whether increased VWF levels reflect disturbances of endothelial function remains to be elucidated. One possibility is that VWF participates in the process of atherogenesis. The aim of the current review is to determine whether VWF deficiency provides protection against the development of atherosclerosis in humans and animals. Results from animal studies suggest that, at arterial branch point predilection sites, VWF deficiency or blockage has a protective effect against atherosclerosis. Based on the available evidence, this potential protective effect of VWF deficiency can most likely be tracked to the VWF\u2013platelet interaction. Sites involved in this interaction could prove attractive targets in future treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease, an option that is already being explored in humans. An unequivocal protective effect of VWD on atherosclerosis has not been demonstrated in humans. However the interpretation of these results is hampered by several methodological weaknesses. In conclusion, VWF is probably a significant player in the multifaceted interaction between the haemostatic system and the atherosclerotic process which deserves further study.",

Patients with either PV or ET can be stratified in a \u201chigh-risk\u201d or \u201clow-risk\u201d category according to their age and previous history of thrombosis. Whether novel risk factors such as leukocytosis and JAK2 mutation may be included in the prognostic stratification requires confirmation in prospective future clinical studies. The identification and appropriate management of cardiovascular risk factors and the promotion of a healthy lifestyle in chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), as in the general population, should be considered a cornerstone of vascular prevention. Blood hyperviscosity in PV is a major cause of vascular disturbances which severely impact on morbidity and mortality. An aggressive target of hematocrit lower than 45% in males and 42% in females has been advised by the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) group, although no convincing evidence of this recommendation is currently available. The efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin (100\u00a0mg daily) in PV has been assessed in the European Collaboration on Low-dose Aspirin in Polycythemia (ECLAP) double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. Translating evidence from the positive results of ECLAP to ET may be questionable. The most commonly used front-line therapy drugs for the treatment of high-risk PV and ET patients include hydroxyurea and alpha-interferon at any age while anagrelide is recommended as second line-therapy in resistant and intolerant ET patients. Busulphan is a front-line therapy in the elderly. By definition, children with ET are a population with low vascular risk unless a major thrombotic or hemorrhagic event has occurred. ELN recommends to prescribe cytoreductive drugs in children as a last resort. No results of clinical trials with JAK-2 inhibitor drugs in PV and ET are so far available.",

One of the commonest complications of an initial venous thrombosis is the development of recurrent thrombosis. Unlike in the case of the first clot, the diagnosis and management of the recurrent episode remain a difficult issue. Even more challenging is the clinical situation where a new thrombus develops while the patient is being treated with anticoagulant medication for a previous clot. The clinical approach and management of these patients are complex, and require understanding of the differences in thrombus development in the different clinical circumstances.",

     "abstract": "Central nervous system (CNS) relapse is an uncommon devastating complication of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that usually occurs within 2\u00a0years from initial diagnosis. Its pathophysiology is poorly understood and there is no consensus on the definition of high-risk patients for CNS relapse. Consequently, an empirical and highly variable practice of chemoprophylaxis is employed. In this review we critically appraise the available literature in order to address issues related to ineffectiveness of current paradigms of chemoprophylaxis. The commonly used prophylaxis is derived from past experience with childhood acute leukemia where most early CNS relapses are leptomeningeal. In contrast, CNS involvement in DLBCL affects brain parenchyma in almost 60% of cases and thus intrathecal prophylaxis remains ineffective. We propose that CNS relapse in DLBCL is sometimes related to occult malignant cells present in the CNS at diagnosis. In others, CNS relapse is likely due to a later acquisition of CNS-penetrating subtypes of malignant clones. With lack of evidence for occult CNS involvement no strong indication currently exist that any form of chemoprophylaxis is beneficial. Future directions for evaluation and treatment of CNS disease are outlined. This complex and intriguing topic should be ideally investigated by prospective trials.",

     "abstract": "Advances in therapy can essentially be measured using two parameters; introduction of a new agent which benefits an increased number of patients over prevailing treatments or more selective use of an existing drug by matching it to the biologic characteristics associated with response. In reviewing the therapeutic landscape of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), both should be applied to gauge the advances in therapy. While several new drugs are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of MDS, three drugs were approved for use in the last decade and sufficient time has elapsed to take stock of the benefit they have produced in the outcome of patients both in terms of survival and quality of life. For the two hypomethylating agents, response remains limited to 50% patients at best, and no strategy has evolved to allow for pre-selection of likely responders, however, 5-azacytidine has been associated with improvement in the survival of higher risk patients. The benefit of lenalidomide was found to be greater for del(5q) patients with transfusion dependent anemia and lower risk disease right from the start, although a quarter of the non-del(5q) patients also experienced complete transfusion independence with this agent. It is in this latter group of non-del(5q) cases that a strategy for potentially preselecting likely responders is suggested by the finding of an expression profile associated with response. In this paper, we will focus on defining our current understanding of the mechanisms of action of the existing FDA approved drugs in order to identify therapeutic strategies that are suitable for specific MDS subtypes. We expect that through advancing biologic insights, the use of such therapies will become more selective and refined.",

Many of these studies firmly correlate fibrinogen with CAD. However, it is uncertain whether this relation is causal or reflects genetic variability and residual confounding by other risk factors. Several polymorphisms on fibrinogen chain genes affect its levels, however only few of the genetic variants are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. As regards the role of fibrinogen in myocardial infarction (MI) studies indicate that genetic variations have at best a modest impact on the process resulting in MI. Therefore, the screening of fibrinogen genes might not be useful for the assessment of the risk of MI. However, the findings that specific genotypes lead to specific differences in fibrinogen levels, but may not be linked to cardiovascular risk, complicates the hypothesis of causality of fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease.",

Here, we discuss the potential for developing targeted therapies for NPM1-mutated AML with focus on: i) interfering with the abnormal traffic of the NPM1 leukemic mutant, i.e. its cytoplasmic dislocation; ii) disrupting the nucleolar structure/function by interfering with residual wild-type nucleophosmin and other nucleolar components acting as hub proteins; and iii) evaluating the activity of epigenetic drugs (e.g. 5-azacytidine) or agents acting on differentiation and apoptosis. As quantitative assessment of NPM1 mutated transcript copies now provides the means to measure minimal residual disease, we also discuss the potential for intervening in NPM1-mutated AML before overt hematological relapse occurs (so-called pre-emptive therapy).",

Rapid telomere shortening of donor cells occurs in the recipient shortly after HSCT; the degree of telomere attrition does not appear to differ by graft source. As expected, telomeres are longer in recipients of grafts with longer telomeres (e.g., cord blood). Telomere attrition may play a role in, or be a marker of, long term outcome after HSCT, but these data are limited.

Fortunately, CML has been the epicenter of exciting advances in cancer therapy with the discovery of the Bcr\u2013Abl gene fusion and the subsequent development of imatinib mesylate, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to target the kinase activity of the bcr\u2013abl protein product. Despite unprecedented durability for complete hematologic, cytogenetic, and molecular responses seen with front-line imatinib therapy, many patients require alternative therapy because of drug intolerance, suboptimal response, primary resistance, secondary resistance, or progression to advanced phase disease. Further, up to 5% of patients present with advanced disease that does not sustain a durable response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Thus, up to one third of CML patients require alternate therapy. Chronic myeloid leukemia has become an exemplary model system for understanding molecular targeting and overcoming mechanisms of drug resistance. This review will discuss potential mechanisms of resistance and ongoing research into novel targets and agents for CML resistant to standard of care.",

Data and controversies regarding conditioning regimen, donor source, GVHD prophylaxis, post transplant interventions and approaches to predict and reduce morbidity and mortality are reviewed. Total body irradiation is very effective but toxic and reduced intensity conditioning is often preferred though associated with somewhat higher rates of recurrence. The risk of chronic GVHD and its late sequelae can be markedly reduced by in-vivo T-cell depletion using alemtuzumab but also leads to somewhat higher incidence of disease recurrence. When using such treatment strategies, one can consider prophylactic or preemptive donor lymphocyte infusions or low toxicity medical treatment such as rituximab.Overall the long term outcomes, particularly survival and current progression free survival of patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation for indolent lymphoma have steadily improved and transplant can now often safely be considered up to the sixth decade of life.

Furthermore, JAK-STAT-relevant mutations in MPN do not always constitute the predominant or ancestral mutant clone. Such complexities undermine the value of JAK-STAT as a robust drug target in MPN and partly explain the hitherto lack of histologic or molecular remissions associated with currently available JAK inhibitors. Most of these drugs were, however, effective in alleviating constitutional symptoms and reducing spleen size; the mechanism of action in this instance includes drug-induced down-regulation of inflammatory cytokine activity. In addition, non-specific myelosuppression contributes to both their salutary and detrimental effects on peripheral blood count. Non-hematologic side effects include gastrointestinal disturbances, asymptomatic elevation of liver and pancreatic enzymes, peripheral neuropathy and hyperacute relapse of symptoms during treatment interruption.

This self-amplifying mechanism nevertheless requires a tight control to prevent uncontrolled platelet aggregate formation that eventually would occlude the vessel. Therefore endothelial cells produce inhibitory compounds such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide that limit the growth of the platelet thrombus to the damaged area.

Standardized tests that assess aggregation function, dense granule deficiency and dense granule secretion are useful for diagnosing common platelet function disorders, in addition to some rare conditions.

     "abstract": "The current standard of care for elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma is melphalan and prednisone (MP) in combination with either bortezomib (VMP) or thalidomide (MPT), with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone increasingly being employed. The addition of bortezomib or thalidomide to the established MP regimen significantly improves outcomes and prolongs survival in elderly and transplant-ineligible patients. However, these benefits are accompanied by increases in treatment-related adverse events (AEs), which may be particularly pronounced in older individuals. Patients receiving bortezomib as part of a VMP regimen commonly experience transient and cyclical thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, along with gastrointestinal AEs. Fortunately, these AEs can be managed with appropriate supportive care and, when necessary, adjustments in dose. Peripheral neuropathy (PN) is the most important side effect of bortezomib, and although it is reversible in a high proportion of patients, it affects their quality of life. Furthermore, PN can require temporary or permanent withholding of bortezomib, which will reduce treatment efficacy. PN is also a common adverse effect of thalidomide; thromboembolic events are also a key concern, requiring thromboprophylaxis in patients receiving thalidomide in combination. For lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, the most clinically important adverse effects are hematologic toxicity (particularly neutropenia) and thromboembolic events. Recent phase III studies in newly diagnosed elderly patients are providing further insight into the most appropriate treatment regimens to maximize outcomes and minimize toxicity in individual patients. Of note, once-weekly bortezomib dosing (in combination with MP\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0T) was shown to reduce the incidence of peripheral neuropathy and gastrointestinal events compared with twice-weekly dosing, while maintaining efficacy. Elderly patients may be less able to withstand the AEs associated with newer treatment regimens and combinations of multiple drugs, and may experience greater declines in quality of life and, subsequently, reduced treatment adherence. It is therefore critical that these patients are closely monitored and any emergent AEs promptly and appropriately managed. For very elderly, frail patients, tailored therapy, reduced intensity regimens, and adverse event management are necessary to encourage treatment adherence and reduce discontinuation. This article will provide practical guidance on the management of bortezomib-, thalidomide-, and lenalidomide-associated AEs, to maximize treatment feasibility and active drug delivered, and thus help minimize toxicity and maximize outcomes.",

PCL can either originate de novo (primary PCL) or as a secondary leukemic transformation of MM (secondary PCL). Presenting signs and symptoms are similar to those seen in MM such as renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, but can also include hepatomegaly and splenomegaly. The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected PCL should include a review of the peripheral blood smear, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) with immunofixation, and protein electrophoresis of an aliquot from a 24h urine collection (UPEP). The diagnosis is made when a monoclonal population of PCs is present in the peripheral blood with an absolute PC count exceeding 2000/\u03bcL and PC comprising 20% or more of the peripheral blood white cells. The prognosis of PCL is poor with a median survival of 7 to 11\u00a0months. Survival is even shorter (2 to 7\u00a0months) when PCL occurs in the context of refractory or relapsing MM. There have been no prospective randomized trials investigating the treatment of PCL. Recommendations are primarily based upon data from small retrospective series, case reports, and extrapolation of data from patients with MM. In general, patients are treated with induction therapy followed by hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in those who are appropriate candidates for this approach. The best induction regimen for PCL is not known and there is great variability in clinical practice. Newer agents that are being incorporated into frontline and salvage therapy for MM have also demonstrated activity in PCL such as Immunomodulatory agents and the use of bortezomib with different combinations.",

Several factors will influence the efficiency of platelet transfusions; fever and ongoing hemorrhage are among the most important patient-dependent factors, but the number and quality of the transfused platelets are also important. The quality of transfused platelets can be evaluated by analyzing platelet activation, metabolism or senescence/apoptosis. Only evaluation of metabolism is included in international guidelines, but high-throughput methods for evaluation of activation and senescence/apoptosis are available and should be incorporated into routine clinical practice if future studies demonstrate that they reflect clinically relevant platelet characteristics. Finally, platelet transfusions have additional biological effects that may cause immunomodulation or altered angioregulation; at present it is not known whether these effects will influence the long-time prognosis of cancer patients.

Long-term follow-up of IRIS patients has defined response parameters and methods of tracking residual disease with cytogenetic testing of bone marrow metaphases and molecular monitoring of BCR\u2013ABL transcripts using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Cytogenetic and molecular responses are now considered useful surrogates for long-term outcome. Early and robust response to imatinib predicts positive long-term outcomes. However, 15\u201325% of patients fail initial treatment or become intolerant of imatinib and need increased doses or alternate treatment. Second-line treatment with the second-generation TKIs nilotinib and dasatinib have resulted in favorable rates of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Data from the ENESTnd (nilotinib) and DASISION (dasatinib) trials in newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML patients demonstrated more robust and rapid complete cytogenetic (77\u201380%) and major molecular responses (43\u201346%) at 12\u00a0months compared with imatinib (65\u201366% and 22\u201328%). The relationship between a complete cytogenetic response at 12\u00a0months and long-term PFS supports a role for second-generation TKIs as first-line treatment of newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML.",

     "abstract": "Physicians treating patients with the classic Philadelphia-negative myeloproliferative neoplasms (Ph-negative MPNs) (polycythemia vera [PV], essential thrombocythemia [ET] and primary myelofibrosis [PMF]) traditionally had few therapeutic drugs available. Spurred by the discovery of activating mutation of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (JAK2 V617F mutation) in patients with Ph-negative MPNs several years ago, several JAK2 inhibitors were synthesized and are currently undergoing clinical trials in patients with PMF, PV and ET. Initial results from these studies have shown that these drugs can markedly reduce spleen size and alleviate constitutional symptoms, increase weight and improve exercise capacity in MF patients, thus improve quality of their life, which is significant clinical benefit. In ET and PV JAK2 inhibitor therapy may efficiently control blood cell count, as well as improve splenomegaly and control disease related symptoms. JAK2 inhibitors are a novel class of agents with promising results for treating patients with MF, PV and ET. In this article we will review the current evidence regarding the role of JAK2 mutations in the pathogenesis of Ph-negative MPNs and summarize results from the most recent clinical trials with JAK2 inhibitors in these disorders.

     "abstract": "For many years, the oral combination melphalan\u2013prednisone (MP) has been considered the standard of care for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) not eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation. In the era of novel agents, the introduction of immunomodulatory drugs and proteasome inhibitors has challenged the role of MP and led to new standards of care for this disease. Five randomized phase III studies compared the traditional MP with the MP plus thalidomide (MPT). All these studies showed a prolonged time to progression (TTP) with the 3-drug combination. However, in only two of these trials this advantage translated into an improvement in overall survival (OS). In another randomized trial, MP plus bortezomib (VMP) was correlated with an increase in both TTP and OS compared with MP. Preliminary data showed the superiority of the association of VMP plus thalidomide followed by bortezomib\u2013thalidomide maintenance (VMPT-VT) vs VMP and melphalan\u2013prednisone\u2013lenalidomide followed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR-R) compared to MP. Promising results have also been reported with the combination of lenalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone. The availability of different efficacious regimens provided clinicians with the opportunity of tailoring the proper and specific approach for each patient. The choice should be based on patients' comorbidities and biologic age, while taking into account the expected toxicity profiles of each treatment regimen. Moreover, an accurate management of therapy-related adverse events and a gentler approach, particularly for patients older than 75\u00a0years, with appropriate age-adjusted dose reductions, should be considered to further improve outcome.",

However, these treatments are associated with significant acute and long-term toxicities, and the treatment of patients presenting with primary resistant disease or those relapsing after a transient response remains challenging.T-ALL is a genetically heterogeneous disease in which numerous chromosomal and genetic alterations cooperate to promote the aberrant proliferation and survival of leukemic lymphoblasts. However, the identification of activating mutations in the NOTCH1 gene in over 50% of T-ALL cases has come to define aberrant NOTCH signaling as a central player in this disease. Therefore, the NOTCH pathway represents an important potential therapeutic target.

The purpose of this review is to summarize the methodologies of MRD assessment, its proven benefits and its further perspectives for optimizing the outcome of transplantation. Proven value of quantitative MRD monitoring by RQ-PCR or MRD-flow consists in using it as an indicator of long-term disease control and potential cure. As MRD kinetics correlates with GVL activity, its suitability for guiding GVL-inducing immunomodulation is currently under investigation. In conclusion, quantitative MRD monitoring seems to be mandatory to assure safe and effective immunotherapy in the context of alloSCT for CLL, which should, however, be best performed within clinical studies.",

     "abstract": "The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are characterized by cytopenias and acute myeloid leukemia risk. Most MDS patients eventually require transfusion of red blood cells for anemia, placing them at risk of iron overload (IOL). In beta-thalassemia major, transfusional IOL leads to organ dysfunction and death, however, with iron chelation therapy survival improved to near normal and organ function was improved. In lower risk MDS, several non-randomized studies suggest an adverse effect of IOL on survival, and that lowering iron minimizes this impact and may improve organ function. While guidelines for MDS generally recommend chelation in selected lower risk patients, data are emerging suggesting IOL may impact adversely on the outcome of higher risk MDS and stem cell transplantation (SCT) and that lowering iron may be beneficial in these patients. Trials to determine whether these effects are truly from lowering iron are currently enrolling. Chelation is costly and potentially toxic, and in MDS should be initiated after weighing potential risks and benefits for each patient until more definitive data are available. In this paper, data on the impact of IOL in MDS and SCT, possible mechanisms of iron toxicity such as oxidative stress, and the impact of lowering iron on organ function and survival are reviewed.",

The cellular mechanisms underlying the generation of HHT telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations are being unravelled, with recent data focussing on a defective response to angiogenic stimuli in particular settings. For affected individuals, there is often substantial morbidity due to sustained and repeated haemorrhages from telangiectasia in the nose and gut. Particular haematological clinical challenges include the management of severe iron deficiency anaemia; handling the intricate balance of antiplatelet or anticoagulants for HHT patients in whom there are often compelling clinical reasons to use such agents; and evaluation of apparently attractive experimental therapies promoted in high profile publications when guidelines and reviews are quickly superseded. There is also a need for sound screening programmes for silent arteriovenous malformations. These occur commonly in the pulmonary, cerebral, and hepatic circulations, may haemorrhage, but predominantly result in more complex pathophysiology due to consequences of defective endothelium, or shunts that bypass specific capillary beds. This review will focus on the new evidence and concepts in this complex and fascinating condition, placing these in context for both clinicians and scientists, with a particular emphasis on haematological settings.",

     "abstract": "Advances in the molecular understanding of myeloma have led to the development of novel agents such as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib). When used alone, these agents have significant activity against myeloma and responses increase significantly when they are combined with additional agents including glucocorticosteroids and chemotherapeutic agents such as alkylators. There is a drive to use these novel agents in patients with newly diagnosed myeloma, where they lead to impressive response rates with increasing duration of responses. In addition, novel agents are now the mainstays of therapy for relapsed disease. In the following paper, we summarize the key observations from recent completed and ongoing studies that determined the effect of these novel therapies both in the setting of newly diagnosed myeloma and for relapsed disease. We also discuss our approach to the use of these agents in specific myeloma settings.",

     "abstract": "The common autosomally inherited mucocutaneous bleeding disorder, von Willebrand disease (VWD) results from quantitative or qualitative defects in plasma von Willebrand factor (VWF). Mutation can affect VWF quantity or its functions mediating platelet adhesion and aggregation at sites of vascular damage and carrying pro-coagulant factor VIII (FVIII). Phenotype and genotype analysis in patients with the three VWD types has aided understanding of VWF structure and function. Investigation of patients with specific disease types has identified mutations in up to 70% of type 1 and 100% of type 3 VWD cases. Missense mutations predominate in type 1 VWD and act through mechanisms including rapid clearance and intracellular retention. Many mutations are incompletely penetrant and attributing pathogenicity is challenging. Other factors including blood group O contribute to low VWF level. Missense mutations affecting platelet- or FVIII-binding through a number of mechanisms are responsible for the four type 2 subtypes; 2A, 2B, 2M and 2N. In contrast, mutations resulting in a lack of VWF expression predominate in recessive type 3 VWD. This review explores the genetic basis of each VWD type, relating mutations identified to disease mechanism. Additionally, utility of genetic analysis within the different disease types is explored.",

Cytogenetic and molecular monitoring enable the identification of patients showing signs of treatment failure and can be used to guide choices regarding subsequent therapeutic options, including imatinib dose escalation, treatment with a secondary TKI or, in selected cases, allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT). Although these alternative therapies may overcome imatinib resistance, long-term remission or cure from CML is likely to require development of novel interventions that effectively eliminate CML stem cells (Ph+HSC).",

Assays have confirmed that the majority of TTP cases are idiopathic and are associated with inhibitors and or IgG antibodies to ADAMTS 13. Such cases take longer to treat and are more likely to relapse. Evidence to date suggests the majority of antibodies block the spacer domain of ADAMTS 13. There may be other antibodies binding to ADAMTS 13 domains but their overall clinical involvement remains to be determined. Immunosuppressive treatments have until now been unsatisfactory.

However, besides the efficient generation of bona fide, clinically safe PSCs (e.g., without the use of oncoproteins and gene transfer based on viruses inserting randomly into the genome), a major challenge in the field remains how to efficiently differentiate PSCs to specific lineages and how to select cells that will function normally upon transplantation in adults.

     "abstract": "New effective strategies are required that specifically address the challenges of multiple myeloma (MM) treatment, namely, disease recurrence, immunosuppression, and treatment-related toxicities. Recent preclinical and clinical findings suggest that the IMiDs\u00ae immunomodulatory compound lenalidomide has a dual mechanism of action, involving both a direct tumoricidal activity and immunomodulation, which may result in rapid and sustained control of MM, respectively. The tumoricidal effect of lenalidomide occurs through several mechanisms, including disruption of stromal support, induction of tumor suppressor genes, and activation of caspases. The immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide, including T-cell and natural killer (NK)-cell activation, and increased expression of death effector molecules, lead to enhanced immune cell function and may explain the beneficial effects of this agent in the maintenance setting. Lenalidomide appears to be effective regardless of prior thalidomide treatment, which may reflect mechanistic differences \u2013 lenalidomide has greater immunomodulatory properties than thalidomide, whereas thalidomide has greater antiangiogenic activity. Recent studies also suggest that the concomitant use of dexamethasone may influence lenalidomide's direct and immunomodulatory effects. Lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone synergistically inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis; however, dexamethasone appears to antagonize the immune-enhancing effect of lenalidomide. A study has demonstrated that a regimen of lenalidomide in combination with an optimal dose and schedule of dexamethasone may increase survival by allowing synergistic antiproliferative effects, without affecting immunomodulatory activity. As preclinical and clinical research continue, additional insights into the dual mechanism of action of lenalidomide will help to further optimize the use of lenalidomide in MM.",

     "abstract": "Lenalidomide is a novel immunomodulatory agent with a unique dual mechanism of action: its tumoricidal effect leads to direct tumor cell death, and its immunomodulatory effect keeps the tumor in remission. Phase III clinical trials have demonstrated that in patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM), lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone offers high clinical response rates and improved time to disease progression, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) compared with dexamethasone alone. In patients with newly diagnosed MM, the combination of lenalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone prolonged survival compared with lenalidomide and standard high-dose dexamethasone. The benefits of lenalidomide-based treatment regimens can be optimized by initiating treatment early in the disease course, either as a frontline treatment or at first relapse. Lenalidomide is generally well tolerated; the primary adverse events are myelosuppression and venous thromboembolic complications. These adverse events emerge early in the course of treatment and can be managed using standard interventions such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, dose reduction, and thromboprophylaxis. The combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone is effective and generally well tolerated in patients with renal impairment provided that creatinine clearance level and adverse events are carefully monitored and the starting dose of lenalidomide is adjusted appropriately. Early results from phase III trials indicate that in patients with newly diagnosed MM, continuous lenalidomide therapy is well tolerated and associated with significant improvements in PFS, offering a new treatment option for patients with MM \u2013 although no OS benefit has yet been seen in this setting. Lenalidomide-based treatment is effective across the spectrum of MM disease phases, allowing for the long-term management of myeloma.",

These novel agents are often used in combination with conventional drugs, such as dexamethasone, to optimize clinical responses; however, they are also being evaluated as part of novel treatment combinations to build upon the success of available treatment regimens. Lenalidomide-based combinations are a focus of clinical research due to the high efficacy, good tolerability, and lack of cumulative toxicity associated with lenalidomide. Lenalidomide is an IMiDs\u00ae immunomodulatory compound with a dual mechanism of action \u2013 tumoricidal effects rapidly reduce MM burden while long-term immunomodulatory actions maintain tumor suppression. Several new agents with antimyeloma effects have been identified including: epigenetic agents (e.g. histone deacetylase inhibitors); novel proteasome inhibitors; novel immunomodulatory compounds; cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors; interleukin-6 inhibitors; and other experimental agents such as heat-shock protein 90 inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies targeting MM cell surface receptors (e.g. anti-CS1 and anti-CD40). Many of these new agents, in combination with lenalidomide, are in early phases of clinical evaluation. Early clinical results are promising, indicating that the novel lenalidomide-based drug combinations are effective and generally well tolerated in patients with MM; future research will continue to evaluate these novel combinations and help to identify the optimal setting (e.g. induction, salvage, or maintenance) in which they may provide the greatest impact on the disease course.",
