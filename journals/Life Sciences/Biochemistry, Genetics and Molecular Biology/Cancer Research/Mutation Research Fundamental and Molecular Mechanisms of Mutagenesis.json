     "abstract": "In this study we investigated nucleotide usage biases along the length of a gene encoding human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and found out that there had been mutational GC-pressure with stronger asymmetric C-pressure in that gene before the preferable direction of nucleotide mutations changed. Current preferable direction of germline mutations in EGFR gene has been estimated with the help of Ensembl data base of gene variations. Preferable direction of somatic mutations in EGFR gene from cancer cells has been estimated with the help of COSMIC data base. Both germline and somatic mutations in cancer cells have the same GC to AT preferable direction in EGFR gene. These data have been used with the aim to find fragments of EGFR gene that have lower probability of missense C to T and G to A transitions to occur. So, the less mutable parts of extracellular EGFR domain are: C-terminal part of the first beta barrel and the central part of the second beta barrel. The less mutable parts of tyrosine kinase EGFR domain are: ATP-binding site (partially), regulatory alpha helix, and fragments that change their secondary structure during the activation process. These parts of EGFR should be considered as the best targets for new types of therapy development. Such criterion as low mutability is especially important for the selection of targets for anti-tumor therapy, since we have detected positive selection of amino acid replacements during somatic mutagenesis of EGFR gene in cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "The classical G2-assay is widely used to assess cell-radiosensitivity and cancer phenotype: Cells are exposed to low doses of ionizing-radiation (IR) and collected for cytogenetic- analysis \u02dc1.5\u2009h later. In this way, chromosome-damage is measured in cells irradiated in G2-phase, without retrieving information regarding kinetics of chromosome-break-repair. Modification of the assay to include analysis at multiple time-points after IR, has enabled kinetic-analysis of chromatid-break-repair and assessment of damage in a larger proportion of G2-phase cells. This modification, however, increases the probability that at later time points not only cells irradiated in G2-phase, but also cells irradiated in S-phase will reach metaphase. However, the response of cells irradiated in G2\u2013phase can be mechanistically different from that of cells irradiated in S-phase. Therefore, indiscriminate analysis may confound the interpretation of experiments designed to elucidate mechanisms of chromosome-break-repair and the contributions of the different DSB-repair-pathways in this response. Here we report an EdU based modification of the assay that enables S- and G2\u2013phase specific analysis of chromatid break repair. Our results show that the majority of metaphases captured during the first 2\u2009h after IR originate from cells irradiated in G2-phase (EdU\u2212 metaphases) in both rodent and human cells. Metaphases originating from cells irradiated in S-phase (EdU+ metaphases) start appearing at 2\u2009h and 4\u2009h after IR in rodent and human cells, respectively. The kinetics of chromatid-break-repair are similar in cells irradiated in G2- and S-phase of the cell-cycle, both in rodent and human cells. The protocol is applicable to classical-cytogenetic experiments and allows the cell-cycle specific analysis of chromosomal-aberrations. Finally, the protocol can be applied to the kinetic analysis of chromosome-breaks in prematurely-condensed-chromosomes of G2-phase cells. In summary, the developed protocol provides means to enhance the analysis of IR-induced-cytogenetic-damage by providing information on the cell-cycle phase where DNA damage is inflicted.",

     "abstract": "For night blindness, a detailed structural exploration of the interactions among G-protein receptor rhodopsin, transducin and arrestin was performed. Rhodopsin is responsible for dim light vision while a point mutation (G90\u2192D90) results in an adverse change in its photo-transduction. The validated 3D models of the three proteins were utilized, and upon mutation and interactions, rhodopsin attained higher stability (evaluated through thermodynamic energy calculations, electrostatic surface potential and solvent accessible area), thereby participating strongly with transducin. Conformational switches in mutated rhodopsin also depicted a firm conformation with few 310 helices accompanied by increased percentage of pure \u03b1-helices and sheets. All evaluations were corroborated through paired T-tests. Glu33 (glycosylated unit in the N-terminal zone) of rhodopsin plays a chief role in the overall interaction pattern. Arg69 and Glu33 from wild-type rhodopsin participated in ionic interactions, while the latter set of ionic interaction remained preserved even after mutation. Cys323 (C-terminal residue) and Arg69 formed H-bonds from the wild-type rhodopsin. Cys323 exceptionally supports cellular signaling pattern in the non-mutated situation and for the non-sufferers of night-blindness. Ser297 and Tyr43 from mutated rhodopsin reside in helices and interact with Thr32 of transducin, preserving the steady conformation in activated interacted state, even in the dark. Ser297 lies adjoined to Lys296 (retinal attachment site), which resides in NPXXY motif (an \"activation switch\" for signal transduction). Thus, the molecular facet for involvement of photo-transduction, which holds a paramount zone in ophthalmology, was dealt with. This might instigate the future prospect for drug discovery to prevent such mutations.",

     "abstract": "HNF4\u03b1 is a culprit gene product for a monogenic and dominantly-inherited form of diabetes, referred to as MODY1 (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 1). Reduced HNF4\u03b1 activities have been linked to impaired insulin secretion and \u03b2-cell function. Numerous mutations have been identified from the patients and they have been instructive as to the individual residue\u2019s role in protein structure-function and dysfunction. As a member of the nuclear receptor (NR) superfamily, HNF4\u03b1 is made of characteristic modular domains and it functions exclusively as a homodimer despite its sequence homology to RXR, a common heterodimer partner of non-steroidal NRs. Transcription factors commonly dimerize to enhance their molecular functions mainly by facilitating the recognition of double helix target DNAs that display an intrinsic pseudo-2-fold symmetry and the recruitment of the remainder of the main transcriptional machinery. HNF4\u03b1 is no exception and its dimerization is maintained by the ligand binding domain (LBD) mainly through the leucine-zipper-like interactions at the stalk of two interacting helices. Although many MODY1 mutations have been previously characterized, including DNA binding disruptors, ligand binding disruptors, coactivator binding disruptors, and protein stability disruptors, protein dimerization disruptors have not been formally reported. In this report, we present a set of data for the two MODY1 mutations found right at the dimerization interface (L332\u2009P and L328del mutations) which clearly exhibit the disruptive effects of directly affecting dimerization, protein stability, and transcriptional activities. These data reinforced the fact that MODY mutations are loss-of-function mutations and HNF4\u03b1 dimerization is essential for its optimal function and normal physiology.",

     "abstract": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are associated with an elevated, but poorly understood baseline of genomic instability (GIN). Expert panels are still debating on whether hyperglycemia is the key element in conferring this high GIN. Since high blood glucose and low blood folate are prevalent in T2DM, we hypothesized that high glucose may work with low folate to induce GIN. Using NCM460, CCD841 and L02 cell lines as in vitro cell models, we investigated the genotoxic effects of high sugars (HS; 1\u20132% glucose, fructose, galactose or sucrose) alone or in combination with folate deficiency (23\u2009nM, FD) over a course of 7 days by the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay. We found that HS is nongenotoxic to NCM460, CCD841 and L02 cells. However, the combination of HS and FD induced significantly higher levels of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds. Our in vitro work demonstrates that HS is non-genotoxic under folate repletive condition, but is genotoxic under FD condition. These results provide preclinal proof of concept that concomitant hyperglycemia and low folate may explain, at least in part, the high baseline of GIN in T2DM patients, suggesting that folate levels should be kept under control in order to limit the risk of GIN and carcinogenesis in T2DM.",

     "abstract": "Missense mutations in certain genes of the Ribonuclease (RNASE) superfamily cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) through loss of either ribonucleolytic or nuclear translocation or both of these activities. While rare ANG/RNASE5 variants have been previously shown to be ALS causative, it is not yet known if any of the reported rare RNASE4 variants can also trigger ALS. The study aims to understand whether rare variants of RNASE4 can manifest ALS through similar loss-of-function mechanisms. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on wild-type and all reported rare RNASE4 variants to study the structural and dynamic changes in the catalytic triad and nuclear localization signal residues responsible for ribonucleolytic and nuclear translocation activities respectively. Our systematic study comprising a total of 2.1\u2009\u03bcs MD simulations reveal that three rare variants M29I, H72P and R95W would lose their ribonucleolytic activity as a result of conformational alteration of catalytic residue His116, and the R31T and R32W variants would lose their nuclear translocation ability due to local folding and reduced solvent accessibility of 30QRR32 residues. Our results show that five among the 20 known rare variants in RNASE4 (M29I, H72P, R95W, R31T and R32W) are possibly deleterious and may manifest ALS due to loss-of-function mechanisms. Overall, this is the first study to demonstrate that although rare and not yet clinically correlated, certain rare RNASE4 variants could cause ALS due to their loss-of-function characteristics and highlights the need to discover novel RNASE variants for a comprehensive understanding of structure-function-disease relationships and design effective therapeutics.",

     "abstract": "It is known that histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) can modify acetylation of tumor cells and affect radiation sensitivity, or, radiosensitivity. While previous studies showed that trichostatin A (TSA, a typical HDACi) could enhance cell acetylation and so be used as radiation-sensitizer in radiotherapy, we questioned if the radiosensitivity is correlated with cellular acetylation directly. So we inspected radiation response of HeLa cells treated with TSA and investigated the time-dependent effect on radiosensitivity. To our surprise, HeLa cells treated with 200\u2009nM TSA for shorter period (6\u2009h) had relatively higher acetylation level but apparently less radiation damage compared to the irradiated cells with same radiation dose treatment of TSA but for longer time (24\u2009h) with lower acetylation level, gainsaying the direct relationship between acetylation and radiosensitivity. We explained that the anti-oxidation activity for the combined treatments with TSA-radiation gave rise to the enhanced radiation protection of the cells at certain period of time. This work has therefore for the first time presented the experimental evidence showing that there is no direct relationship between acetylation and radiation sensitivity, and our results may also provide the guidance for optimized radiotherapy assisted by HDACis in cancer treatment.",

     "publication date": "01-2019",
     "abstract": "Endonuclease III is a DNA glycosylase previously known for its repair activity on oxidative pyrimidine damage. Uracil is a deamination product derived from cytosine. Uracil DNA N-glycosylase (UNG) and mismatch-specific uracil DNA glycosylase (MUG) are two known repair enzymes with enzymatic activity on uracil in E. coli. Here we report a G/U specific uracil DNA glycosylase activity in E. coli endonuclease III (endo III, Nth), which is comparable to MUG but significantly lower than its thymine glycol DNA glycosylase activity. The possibility that the novel activity is due to contamination is ruled out by expressing the wild type nth gene and an active site mutant in a uracil-repair-deficient genetic background. Consistent with the biochemical analysis, analyses of lac+\u2009reversion and mutation frequencies in the presence of human AID induced cytosine deamination indicate the endo III can play a role in repair of cytosine deamination. In addition to E. coli, UDG activity is found in endo III homologs from other organisms. E. coli nucleoside diphosphate kinase (Ndk) was also tested for UDG activity because it was previously reported as an uracil repair enzyme. Under the assay conditions, very limited UDG activity was detected in single-stranded uracil-containing DNA from E. coli Ndk and no UDG activity was detected in human Ndk homologs. This study provides definitive clarification on uracil repair by endo III and reveals that endonuclease III is a G/U-specific UDG that can be viewed as a prototype for the human MBD4 uracil DNA glycosylase.",

     "abstract": "Synonymous variations, previously considered as neutral, are recently shown to have a significant impact on mRNA structure and stability thereby affecting protein expression and function. Their role in disease pathogenesis is also emerging. GATA4 is an important transcription factor involved in cardiac development and a well-known candidate gene associated with congenital heart disease (CHD). In the present study, we sought to conduct molecular screening of GATA4 gene in 285 sporadic and non-syndromic CHD cases. We identified four synonymous (c.27C>A, c.822C>T, c.1233G>A and c.1263C>T) and two intronic variants (g.83217T>G & g.85012T>A) in GATA4. Extensive computational analysis using widely acceptable tools i.e., Mfold, Human Splicing Finder (HSF) and Codon Usage bias was performed with a view to understand their putative downstream effects on GATA4 function. Mfold, a mRNA structure prediction tool showed the alterations of the mRNA structure and stability due to synonymous variants. Similarly, HSF also confidently predicted effect on the cis-acting regulatory elements of splicing due to four synonymous and one donor site intronic variants. Additionally, a significant change in \u2018Relative Synonymous Codon usage (RSCU) frequencies\u2019 and \u2018log ratio of codon usage frequencies\u2019 of variant codon was also noted that might affect the rate of translation. This study establishes that the synonymous variants are possibly associated with disease phenotype in CHD patients. Comprehensive computational analysis, using well-established web based tools, is suggestive of their potential downstream molecular effects on the structure, stability and expression of GATA4 protein.",

In SMART, larvae were fed with each lyophilized eggplant. The results revealed that no sample was mutagenic. Interestingly, we found that all six eggplants had a potent inhibitory effect against urethane-induced mutagenicity. Moreover, the protective effect of each eggplant extract against oxidative DNA damage in human lymphocytes was investigated using the single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. The treatment cells with six eggplant extracts prevented DNA human lymphocytes in response to hydrogen peroxide, especially ML extract exhibited higher an inhibition percentage than other samples. This study demonstrated that these eggplants seem to be safe for consumption and their extracts could protect against DNA damage.

Previous studies have found that endometriosis had frequent defects in zona pellucida (ZP), and mutations in ZP genes could lead to ZP defects, raising the possibility that mutations in ZP genes might exist in endometriosis. We analyzed a total of 152 Han Chinese samples with ovarian endometriosis for the presence of mutations in the ZP1, ZP2, ZP3 and ZP4 genes. Two novel nonsynonymous ZP4 mutations were identified in three out of 152 (2.0%) samples: a p.M1?/(c.3\u2009G\u2009>\u2009C) mutation in a 27- and 35-year-old sample, respectively, and a p.A433\u2009V (c.1298C\u2009>\u2009T) mutation in a 31-year-old patient. No mutations were detected in ZP1, ZP2 or ZP3 genes; furthermore, no mutations in ZP genes were identified in 85 female control samples without endometriosis. The p.M1?/(c.3\u2009G\u2009>\u2009C) mutation could lead to the usage of a downstream translation initiation site, while the evolutionary conservation and protein structural modeling analyses suggested that the p.A433\u2009V mutation might be functionally important. However, there were strikingly different fertility outcomes among the three samples with ZP4 mutations: the p.A433V-mutated sample had no problem in fertility; while the p.M1?-mutated samples presented with paradoxical effects on fertility: the 35-year-old patient had a child while the 27-year-old patient was infertile, who underwent two spontaneous abortions and an implantation failure after IVF treatment. These results suggested that the potential role of ZP4 mutations on human fertility might be more complex than we thought, and other genetic and environment factors might play a role. In conclusion, we identified two novel mutations in the ZP4 gene in 2.0% of Han Chinese patients with ovarian endometriosis for the first time, our results suggested that mutations in ZP4, but not ZP1, ZP2 and ZP3, might play active roles in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometriosis, despite the mutation-carriers present with complex fertility outcomes.",

     "abstract": "BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes involved in the repair of DNA damage and transcriptional regulation of the cell cycle. Alterations in BRCA1/2 lead to production of functionally defective proteins that impair DNA repair. Certain mutant variants of BRCA1/2 are strongly associated with increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers, with emerging data on association with other types of cancer. However, variability of BRCA1/2 in Russian populations remains understudied. In this study, we performed targeted sequencing of BRCA1/2 in 145 breast cancer (BC) patients with a family history of BRCA-associated cancers and 47 age-matched cancer-free control individuals with or without a family history of cancer. Subjects for this study were recruited in the Voronezh region of the Russian Federation. We found that two polymorphic variants, rs1799967 (BRCA1) and rs4987117 (BRCA2), were strongly associated with the risk of BC. Both variants have not been previously reported as associated with risk of breast cancer. Presence of the rs4987117 variant increases risk of breast cancer onset (OR\u2009=\u20092.76, p-value\u2009=\u20090.022). Notably, although variant rs80357906 (5382InsC) has been reported as a risk factor for hereditary BC, it was not significantly associated with breast cancer risk in our population (p\u202f=\u202f0.192). We also found 12 novel polymorphic variants in BRCA1/2 genes (2 in BRCA1 and 10 in BRCA2). However, none of these variants demonstrated association with the disease. Five germline variants were observed at high frequency (mean AF\u2009=\u200967.14%) and therefore can be considered as a common haplotype in the Voronezh region of the Russian Federation. In summary, our study demonstrates that known pathological variants of BRCA1/2 genes may not be reflective of breast cancer risk assessment when applied to the Russian population. Further, more extended population-specific studies are needed to reveal the reliable list of BRCA1/2 polymorphisms associated with risk of breast cancer in the Russian population.",

Herein we present different CGRs on chromosome 5p in a mother and her daughter that through unequal crossing-over during meiosis has evolved from a chromothriptic rearrangement in the mother into another complex rearrangement in her daughter involving both deletions and duplications. Initially, both rearrangements were classified as simple copy number variants, but follow-up studies using whole-genome sequencing revealed a much more complex nature of both rearrangements and enabled us to decipher the biological process involved in the formation of the rearrangement found in the daughter.In conclusion, these two cases highlight the need of analyzing the inheritance patterns of CGRs, and provide an example of a disease-causing CGR formed through multiple genetic events.",

     "abstract": "Worldwide, millions of professionals who work in operating rooms are occupationally exposed to inhalational anesthetics. Thus, the potential health effects of the continuous exposure to inhalational anesthetics on individuals in the operating room remain a subject of debate. Human biomonitoring is a potentially useful tool for assessing the health of exposed professionals. No report has yet evaluated the possible cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of the most commonly used inhalational anesthetics on young professionals who are occupationally exposed. Considering the importance of this issue, we monitored physicians who were exposed to inhalational anesthetics during their first year of a medical residency program to evaluate the possible early damage events. Twenty-six young physicians who had been occupationally exposed to the anesthetics isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane, and nitrous oxide and who worked in operating rooms using modern anesthesia workstations during their medical residency program, participated in this study. Blood samples were evaluated before the start of the program (before the exposure), and after 1/2 year and 1 year of exposure. We monitored the subjects by assessing the cytotoxicity (early apoptosis and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential) using flow cytometry and genotoxicity using the comet assay. No significant changes were observed in the biomarkers of cytotoxicity or genotoxicity (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Thus, biomonitoring showed that short-term exposure to inhalational anesthetics did not induce early cell damage during the first year of medical residency. Based on the results, brief occupational exposure to anesthetics does not induce either cytotoxicity or genotoxicity in mononuclear cells under the conditions of this study. Thus, young physicians should undergo additional biomonitoring at the beginning of their careers to determine possible toxic effects on their cells and genetic material, and further investigations are warranted to determine whether a longer exposure to inhalational anesthetics results in mitochondrial depolarization, apoptosis and DNA breaks.",

Male balb/c mice were divided into four groups: control, Aloe vera gel extract [AV] (50\u202fmg/ kg b.w on alternate days for 30 days), X-ray (2\u202fGy) and AV\u202f+\u202fX-ray. X-ray irradiation enhanced the serum levels of liver function indices and chromosomal abnormalities in liver. Kidney function markers were found to be deranged and were accompanied by reduced glomerular filtration rate indicating renal dysfunction. Irradiation caused histopathological and biochemical alterations in both tissues which was associated with enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation (LPO) levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity and enhanced apoptosis as revealed by TUNEL assay and DNA fragmentation. The administration of Aloe vera gel extract to X-ray exposed animals significantly improved their hepatic and renal function parameters which were associated with a reduction in ROS/LPO levels, LDH activity and chromosomal abnormalities as compared to their irradiated counterparts. In vitro assays revealed effective radical scavenging ability of Aloe vera gel extract, which may be linked to its potential in exhibiting antioxidant effects in in vivo conditions. This data suggested that Aloe vera may serve to boost the antioxidant system, thus providing protection against hepatic and renal damage caused by X-ray.",

Experimental induction of PCC was achieved by somatic cell hybridization (SCH), an approach which evolved into a chemical-induction process. PCC presents most probably the only way in which cytogenetic assessment of damages can be analyzed in special situations such as availability of limited numbers of sample cells and for cells which have lost their ability to divide. Initial experiments on PCC were reported in late 1960s and the technique has evolved into one with wide range of applications owing to its increased efficiency in detecting primary DNA damages. Biodosimetry remains as the primary area which utilizes PCC technique to the maximum efficiency with several multiple-groups participating in collaborative exercises for biodosimetric applications. However, in spite of the advantages that the technique offers, it is yet to reach its full potential. This is due to the inherent limitations of the manner in which PCC is induced currently; by the somatic cell hybridization and chemical-induction processes. An approach which combines these two would sure help in taking PCC to its highest potential as the preferred technique for assessment of primary DNA damages. We present the chronological events of evolution of the PCC technique along with its applications. Also, the limitations of the technique along with the suggestions for further refinement of the PCC technique are discussed.",

Clustered DNA damage, consisting of DNA lesions in close proximity, has been studied in detail, and has enhanced mutagenic potential depending on the configuration of the lesions. However, it is not known whether clustered DNA damage affects the mutagenic potential of a sufficiently separated, isolated lesion. Using synthetic damage constructs, we investigated the mutagenic potential of an isolated 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) separated by at least 7 bp from other lesions. Under the spatial distribution of DNA lesions tested in the present study, neighboring clustered DNA lesions likely retarded the processing of the isolated 8-oxoG and resulted in enhanced mutation frequency. However, the enhanced mutagenic potential was dependent on which strand the isolated 8-oxoG was located. Our results indicate that the processing of a bi-stranded cluster could affect the mutagenic outcome of a nearby isolated lesion, separated up to \u223c20 bp.",

Consecutive 151 pediatric AML patients were prospectively enrolled from June 2013 to August 2016, for evaluating pattern of variations in mitochondrial D-loop region and to determine their association, if any, with expression of mitochondrial-encoded genes. For each patient, D-loop region was sequenced on baseline bone marrow, buccal swab and mother\u2019s blood sample. Real time PCR was used for relative gene expression of four mitochondrial DNA encoded genes viz. Nicotinamide-adenine-dineucleotide-dehydrogenase subunit 3 (ND3), Cytochrome-B (Cyt-B), Cytochrome c oxidase-I (COX1) and ATP-synthetase F0 subunit-6 (ATP6). Total 1490 variations were found at 237 positions in D-Loop; 1206 (80.9%) were germline and 284 (19.1%) were somatic. Positions 73\u2013263 were identified as a probable hotspot region. G bases appeared to be most stable nucleotide (least number of single base substitutions) whereas T appeared to be most susceptible to variations with germline T-C being the commonest. Gene expression of Cyt-B was found to be significantly higher for any variation (somatic or germline) at positions 16,192 and 16,327 while it was significantly lower for variations at positions 16,051 and 207. Any variation at positions 152, 207 and 513 significantly decreased COX1 expression while those at positions 16,051 and 152 attenuated ATP6 expression. This first study evaluated type and overall pattern of D-loop variations in AML, and also showed that some of these variations in D loop region might have an effect on the mitochondrial-encoded genes which is new and valuable information in AML genomics.",

     "abstract": "Cytosine and adenosine deamination events (DNA, RNA substrates) account for most codon-context Targeted Somatic Mutation (TSM) patterns observed in immunoglobulin (Ig) somatic hypermutation (SHM), and in cancer exomes following Ig-SHM-like responses. TSM refers to the process of somatic mutagenesis involving deamination events that results on a dominant type of mutation (e.g., C-to-T), and co-incident at a particular motif (e.g., WRC), and preferentially targeting the first, second or third nucleotide position within the mutated codon (e.g. MC1, MC2 or MC3, read 5-prime to 3-prime). It is now widely accepted that if left uncorrected, the accumulation of uncorrected TSMs involving the deaminases, may lead to a diagnosis of cancer or other degenerative disease. Our hypothesis is that many missense, nonsense and synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with clinically significant diseases may have arisen in the population by similar highly targeted deamination events. The OMIM database was searched for disease-associated SNPs on the X chromosome, and for all chromosomes. The nucleotide substitution patterns for disease-associated SNPs were analyzed by the TSM method to identify the likely deaminase source for C-to-U (C-to-T/G-to-A) and A-to-I (A-to-G/T-to-C) derived gene mutations preferentially targeting known sequence motifs associated with the deaminases: AID, APOBEC3G, APOBEC3B and ADAR 1/2. Of the 789 OMIM SNPs analysed. In both data sets, the mutation targeting preferences within the mutated codon reveal a statistically significant bias (p\u202f<\u202f0.001). The results imply that a deamination of C-site and A-site targets are written into the human germline for the chromosome wide exomic SNPs analysed. This is consistent with previously observed mutation patterns arising in cancer genomes and hypermutated Ig genes during SHM. The results imply that similar types of deaminase-mediated molecular processes that occur in somatic hypermutation and cancer, may be contributing causative drivers of human exomic SNPs.",

     "abstract": "Identification of all genetic variants associated with complex traits is one of the most important goals in modern human genetics. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successfully applied to identify common variants, which thus far explain only small portion of heritability. Interests in rare variants have been increasingly growing as an answer for this missing heritability. While next-generation sequencing allows detection of rare variants, its cost is still prohibitively high to sequence a large number of human DNA samples required for rare variant association studies. In this study, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of sequencing for pooled DNA samples of multiple individuals (Pool-seq) as a cost-effective and robust approach for rare variant discovery. We comparatively analyzed Pool-seq vs. individual-seq of indexed target capture of up to 960 genes in \u223c1000 individuals, followed by independent genotyping validation studies. We found that Pool-seq was as effective and accurate as individual-seq in detecting rare variants and accurately estimating their minor allele frequencies (MAFs). Our results suggest that Pool-seq can be used as an efficient and cost-effective method for discovery of rare variants for population-based sequencing studies in individual laboratories.",

CA was presented as abnormal cell (Abc), aberrations (Abn) and number of aberration/abnormal cell (Abn/Abc), and correlated with age-at-exposure (childhood: <1\u201310\u202fyears; young: 11\u201326\u202fyears; adult: >27 years). Age related increase in abnormalities (Abc, Abn, Abn/Abc) was observed in all exposure strata, except moderately exposed adult-group, which has exhibited lower Abn/Abc than similarly exposed childhood and young age-groups. Elevation of CA was also related to exposure status. Abn/Abc frequency was significantly higher in the severely exposed young and adult groups compared to the controls of the same age. Two-way ANOVA revealed significant abnormalities between the exposed groups; however, interaction of age and exposure was not statistically significant. Significant difference in group-means of Abc and Abn was also observed between adult and childhood in Tukey HSD test. Altogether, a significant interaction of age and MIC-exposure on CA could not be established due to inter-individual variation and lack of baseline information on CA. Significantly higher Abn was observed in people consuming tobacco; however, interaction of lifestyle with additional environmental/occupational exposures during last 30 years against a background exposure to MIC remained un-elucidated. Nevertheless, the study was important for demonstration of the correlation of the current status of CA in circulating lymphocytes with age and exposure status of the MIC-exposed survivors.",

A recent exome sequencing study found that 25% (10/39) of deep infiltrating endometriosis harbored cancer driver gene mutations. However, it is unclear whether these mutations also exist in ovarian endometriosis. Here, a total of 101 ovarian endometriosis samples were analyzed for the presence of these gene mutations, including KRAS, PPP2R1A, PIK3CA and ARID1A. In addition, 6 other cancer-associated genes (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, ERK1, ERK2 and PTEN) were also analyzed. In total, four somatic mutations were identified in three out of 101 ovarian endometriotic lesions (4%, 4/101), including a KRAS p.G12V, a PPP2R1A p.S256F and two ARID1A nonsense mutations (p.Q403* and p.G1926*); while no mutations were identified in the remaining 7 genes (BRAF, NRAS, HRAS, ERK1, ERK2, PTEN and PIK3CA). Note that the KRAS G12V and ARID1A Q403* mutations co-occurred in a 36-year-old sample who had a high serum CA125 (308.4\u202fU/mL) and a late menarche age (18-year-old). Additionally, no mutations in any of the 10 genes were identified in either the healthy eutopic endometrial tissues from 85 control individuals without endometriosis, or in 62 healthy ovarian tissues from ovarian cysts samples (without endometriosis). Our study revealed, for the first time, the presence of classical cancer driver gene mutations in ovarian endometriosis. Furthermore, the co-occurrence of KRAS and ARID1A mutations was identified in a single individual for the first time. The observations of cancer driver gene mutations in our ovarian endometriosis samples, together with several prior observations, further support the notion that endometriosis is a premalignant disorder.",

A particularly high frequency (\u223c59% of the cases) of p53 inactivating mutation on exon 7 has been detected. Our identification of hitherto unreported TP53 mutations in HM suggests the presence of p53 mutants and reflects the advantages of using pyrosequencing for point mutation detection in clinical samples.

In the G1 phase, inactive Mcm2-7 complexes are loaded on the replication origins by replication-initiator proteins, ORC and Cdc6. Two kinases, S-CDK and DDK, convert the inactive origin-loaded Mcm2-7 complex to an active helicase, the CMG complex in the S phase. The activated CMG complex begins DNA unwinding and recruits enzymes essential for DNA synthesis to assemble a replisome at the replication fork. After completion of DNA synthesis, the inactive CMG complex on the replicated DNA is removed from chromatin to terminate DNA replication. In this review, we will discuss the structure, function, and regulation of the molecular machines involved in each step of DNA replication.",

HR is also crucial for preserving genomic integrity of somatic cells due to its ability to rescue collapsed replication forks and eliminate deleterious DNA lesions, such as double-strand breaks (DSBs), interstrand crosslinks, and single-strand DNA gaps. Here, we review the early steps of HR (homology search and strand exchange), focusing on the roles of the two ends of a DSB. A detailed overview of the basic HR machinery and its mechanism for template selection and capture of duplex DNA via strand exchange is provided. Roles of proteins involved in these steps are discussed in both mitotic and meiotic HR. Central to this review is the hypothesis, which suggests that in meiosis, HR begins with a symmetrical DSB, but the symmetry is quickly lost with the two ends assuming different roles; it argues that this disparity of the two ends is essential for regulation of HR in meiosis and successful production of haploid gametes. We also propose a possible evolutionary reason for the asymmetry of the ends in HR.",

     "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are induced by a variety of genotoxic agents, including ionizing radiation and chemotherapy drugs for treating cancers. The elimination of DSBs proceeds via distinctive error-free and error-prone pathways. Repair by homologous recombination (HR) is largely error-free and mediated by RAD51/BRCA2 gene products. Classical non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) requires the Ku heterodimer and can efficiently rejoin breaks, with occasional loss or gain of DNA information. Recently, evidence has unveiled another DNA end-joining mechanism that is independent of recombination factors and Ku proteins, termed alternative non-homologous end joining (A-NHEJ). While A-NHEJ-mediated repair does not require homology, in a subtype of A-NHEJ, DSB breaks are sealed by microhomology (MH)-mediated base-pairing of DNA single strands, followed by nucleolytic trimming of DNA flaps, DNA gap filling, and DNA ligation, yielding products that are always associated with DNA deletion. This highly error-prone DSB repair pathway is termed microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). Dissecting the mechanisms of MMEJ is of great interest because of its potential to destabilize the genome through gene deletions and chromosomal rearrangements in cells deficient in canonical repair pathways, including HR and C-NHEJ. In addition, evidence now suggests that MMEJ plays a physiological role in normal cells.",

Among them, promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) are involved in multiple genome maintenance pathways including the DNA damage response, DNA repair, telomere homeostasis, and p53-associated apoptosis. In response to DNA damage, PML-NBs are coalesced and divided by a fission mechanism, thus increasing their number. PML-NBs also play a role in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR). Clinically, the dominant negative PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein expressed in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) inhibits the transactivation of downstream factors and disrupts PML function, revealing the tumor suppressor role of PML-NBs. All-trans retinoic acid and arsenic trioxide treatment has been implemented for promyelocytic leukemia to target the PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein. PML-NBs are associated with various factors implicated in genome maintenance, and are found at the sites of DNA damage. Their interaction with proteins such as p53 indicates that PML-NBs may play a significant role in apoptosis and cancer. Decades of research have revealed the importance of PML-NBs in diverse cellular pathways, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms and exact functions of PML-NBs remain elusive.

CFSs are specific genomic regions within the normal chromosomal structure, which appear as gaps and breaks in the metaphase chromosomes of cells grown under mild replication stress conditions. The main characteristics predisposing CFSs to instability include late replication timing, delayed replication completion, failure to activate additional origins, origin paucity along large genomic regions, collision between replication and transcription complexes along large genes, and the presence of AT-dinucleotide rich sequences. The contribution of these features to instability at CFSs during early cancer development is discussed.",

Replication of mtDNA is challenged not only by threats related to the replication machinery and orchestration of DNA synthesis, but also by factors linked to the peculiarity of this genome. Indeed the architecture, organization, copy number, and location of mtDNA, which are markedly distinct from the nuclear genome, require ad hoc and complex regulation to ensure coordinated replication. As a consequence sub-optimal mtDNA replication, which results from compromised regulation of these factors, is generally associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and disease. Mitochondrial DNA replication should be considered in the context of the organelle and the whole cell, and not just a single genome or a single replication event. Major threats to mtDNA replication are linked to its dependence on both mitochondrial and nuclear factors, which require exquisite coordination of these crucial subcellular compartments. Moreover, regulation of replication events deals with a dynamic population of multiple mtDNA molecules rather than with a fixed number of genome copies, as it is the case for nuclear DNA. Importantly, the mechanistic aspects of mtDNA replication are still debated. We describe here major challenges for human mtDNA replication, the mechanistic aspects of the process that are to a large extent original, and their consequences on disease.",

Human cells possess three types of proteins, MTH1 (NUDT1), MTH2 (NUDT15) and MTH3 (NUDT18), which have the potential to hydrolyze deoxyribonucleoside di- and triphosphates containing 8-oxoG to the monophosphate, the form of which is unusable for DNA synthesis. To elucidate the physiological roles of these enzymes, we constructed single knockout (KO) cell lines for each of the MTH1, MTH2 and MTH3 genes and MTH1 and MTH2-double KO cell lines from the human HeLa S3 line using CRISPR/Cas9. With the exception of MTH3-KO, all of the KO cell lines showed similar proliferation rates to the parental line, HeLa S3, indicating that the MTH1 and MTH2 functions are dispensable for cell growth. On the other hand, the MTH3-KO cells showed a significantly slower growth rate, suggesting that MTH3 has a definite role in cell growth in addition to the cleavage of 8-oxoG-containing deoxyribonucleotide. MTH1-KO, MTH2-KO and MTH1- MTH2-KO cells exhibited increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide, whereas MTH3-KO did not. MTH1-KO cells showed only a slight increase in mutant frequency in comparison to the parental HeLa S3 line. The overproduction of MTH1 and MTH2 suppressed the mutator phenotype of mutT-deficient E. coli cells, whereas the overproduction of MTH3 did not show such a suppressive effect. Our findings suggest that both MTH1 and MTH2 are involved in the maintaining genome stability in human cells against oxidative stress, while MTH3 may play some other role(s).",

One of the signaling pathways that play a crucial role in the process of hematopoiesis is the Stem Cell Factor (SCF) mediated c-Kit pathway. The c-Kit is a Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK), which is expressed in the cells including HSCs. It undergoes dimerization upon binding with its cognate ligand SCF. As a result, phosphorylation of the Juxtamembrane (JM) domain of c-Kit takes place at Tyr568 and Tyr570 residues. These phosphorylated residues become the docking sites for protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) namely SHP-1 and SHP-2, which in turn cause dephosphorylation and negative regulation of the downstream signaling responsible for the cell proliferation. Interestingly, it has been reported that the mutation of c-Kit at D816V makes it independent of SCF stimulation and SHP-1/SHP-2 inhibition, thereby, causing its constitutive activation. The present study was commenced to elucidate the structural behavior of this mutation in the JM and A-loop region of c-Kit using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of the wild-type and mutant c-Kit in unphosphorylated and phosphorylated states. The energy difference computed between the wild type and mutant (D816V) c-Kit, and protein\u2013protein docking and complex analysis revealed the impact of this single residue mutation on the integrity dynamics of c-Kit that makes it independent of SHP-1/SHP-2 negative regulation.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we report the identification and functional characterization of the Drosophila ben/ubc13 gene, encoding a unique ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Ubc or E2), in DNA-damage response. Ben forms a heterodimer with DmUev1a, the only Ubc/E2 variant (Uev) in Drosophila. Ben and DmUev1a act together to catalyze K63-linked polyubiquitination in vitro. ben can functionally rescue the yeast ubc13 null mutant from killing by DNA-damaging agents. We also find that BenP97S, which was previously described to affect the connectivity between the giant fiber and the tergotrochanter motor neuron, fails to interact with the RING protein Chfr but retains interaction with DmUev1a as well as Uevs from other species. The corresponding yeast Ubc13P97S interacts with Mms2 but fails to bind Rad5. Consequently, neither benP97S nor ubc13P97S is able to complement the yeast ubc13 mutant defective in error-free DNA-damage tolerance. More importantly, the benP97S mutant flies are more sensitive to a DNA-damaging agent, suggesting that Ben functions in a manner similar to its yeast and mammalian counterparts. Collectively, our observations imply that Ben-DmUev1a-promoted K63-linked polyubiquitination and involvement in DNA-damage response are highly conserved in eukaryotes including flies.",

This computational study brings together these three molecular criteria for the first time.Three methylated DNA bases\u2014N7-methylguanine, O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine\u2014are studied using computational chemical methods. Watson-Crick proton loss is predicted more feasible for the mutagenic O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine than for the non-mutagenic N7-methylguanine in agreement with the observed trend for pKa values. Attainment of a conformer conducive to mutagenesis is more feasible for O6-methylguanine than for O4-methylthymine, though the latter is more mutagenic. These methylated bases yield 9 H-bonded pairs with normal DNA bases. At biological pH, O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine would yield stable mutagenic pairs having Watson-Crick type configuration by H-bonded pairing with thymine and guanine respectively, while N7-methylguanine would yield a non-mutagenic pair with cytosine. The three criteria thus well differentiate the non-mutagenic N7-methylguanine from the mutagenic O6-methylguanine and O4-methylthymine in good accord with experimental observations.",

     "abstract": "Heavy-ion beam irradiation is a powerful physical mutagen that has been used to create numerous mutant materials in plants. These materials are an essential resource for functional genomics research in the post-genome era. The advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technology has promoted the study of functional genomics and molecular breeding. A wealth of information can be gathered from whole genome re-sequencing; however, understanding the molecular mutation profile at genome wide, as well as identifying causal genes for a given phenotype are big challenging issues for researchers. The huge outputs created by NGS make it difficult to capture key information. It is worthy to explore an effective and efficient data-sieving strategy for mutation scanning at whole genome scale. Re-sequencing data from one laboratory wild type (Columbia) and eleven M3Arabidopsis thaliana lines derived from carbon-ion beam irradiation were used in present study. Both the number and different combinations of samples used for analysis affected the sieving results. The result indicated that using six samples was sufficient to filter out the shared mutation (background interference) sites as well as to identify the true mutation sites in the whole genome. The final number of candidate mutation sites could be further narrowed down by combining traditional rough map-based cloning. Our results demonstrated the feasibility of a parallel sequencing analysis as an efficient tool for the identification of mutations induced by carbon-ion beam irradiation. For the first time, we presented different analysis strategies for handling massive parallel sequencing data sets to detect the mutations induced by carbon-ion beam irradiation in Arabidopsis thaliana with low false-positive rate, as well as to identify the causative nucleotide changes responsible for a mutant phenotype.",

Six-week-old UN and WN Han-Wistar rats were treated with TMP-SMX at a daily dose of 10\u202fmg/kg/d TMP and 50\u202fmg/kg/d SMX for 5 or 10\u202fdays.

DNA repair and damage signaling networks play a central role maintaining genome stability, suppressing tumorigenesis, and determining tumor response to common cancer chemotherapeutic agents and radiotherapy. DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are critical lesions induced by ionizing radiation and when replication forks encounter damage. DSBs can result in mutations and large-scale genome rearrangements reflecting mis-repair by non-homologous end joining or homologous recombination. Ionizing radiation induces genetic change immediately, and it also triggers delayed events weeks or even years after exposure, long after the initial damage has been repaired or diluted through cell division.

Bill Morgan served in an expert capacity for several of these organizations particularly for the application of radiation biology data to risk assessment. He brought great enthusiasm and dedication to these committee efforts. In fact, he really enjoyed this type of service. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), for example, provides comprehensive reviews of the input data for radiation risk assessments. In this context, they do not conduct risk assessments. In Europe, a research component of the risk assessment process is provided by the Multidisciplinary European Low Dose Initiative (MELODI). Specific issue areas are identified for which additional research can aid in reducing uncertainty in risk assessments. The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) uses these types of input data to develop nominal cancer risk estimates as input data for establishing dose limits for the public and workers. A similar regulatory role is provided in the US by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). The NCRP Reports address the underlying principles for setting regulatory dose limits for the US public and workers; these differ to a limited extent from those of ICRP. The implementation of dose limits is conducted by individual countries but with significant guidance by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) through its Basic Safety Standards.

     "abstract": "The effect of ionizing irradiation on cytoplasmic organelles is often underestimated because the general dogma considers direct DNA damage in the nuclei to be the primary cause of radiation induced toxicity. Using a precision microbeam irradiator, we examined the changes in mitochondrial dynamics and functions triggered by targeted cytoplasmic irradiation with \u03b1-particles. Mitochondrial dysfunction induced by targeted cytoplasmic irradiation led to activation of autophagy, which degraded dysfunctional mitochondria in order to maintain cellular energy homeostasis. The activation of autophagy was cytoplasmic irradiation-specific and was not detected in nuclear irradiated cells. This autophagic process was oxyradical-dependent and required the activity of the mitochondrial fission protein dynamin related protein 1 (DRP1). The resultant mitochondrial fission induced phosphorylation of AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK) which leads to further activation of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2 with concomitant inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to initiate autophagy. Inhibition of autophagy resulted in delayed DNA damage repair and decreased cell viability, which supports the cytoprotective function of autophagy. Our results reveal a novel mechanism in which dysfunctional mitochondria are degraded by autophagy in an attempt to protect cells from toxic effects of targeted cytoplasmic radiation.",

     "abstract": "Controlled ecological life support systems (CELSS) will be an important feature of long-duration space missions of which higher plants are one of the indispensable components. Because of its pivotal role in enabling plants to cope with environmental stress, interplant communication might have important implications for the ecological stability of such CELSS. However, the manifestations of interplant communication in microgravity conditions have yet to be fully elucidated. To address this, a well-established Arabidopsis thaliana co-culture experimental system, in which UV-C-induced airborne interplant communication is evaluated by the alleviation of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) in bystander plants, was placed in microgravity modeled by a two-dimensional rotating clinostat. Compared with plants under normal gravity, TGS alleviation in bystander plants was inhibited in microgravity. Moreover, TGS alleviation was also prevented when plants of the pgm-1 line, which are impaired in gravity sensing, were used in either the UV-C-irradiated or bystander group. In addition to the specific TGS-loci, interplant communication-shaped genome-wide DNA methylation in bystander plants was altered under microgravity conditions. These results indicate that interplant communications might be modified in microgravity. Time course analysis showed that microgravity interfered with both the production of communicative signals in UV-C-irradiated plants and the induction of epigenetic responses in bystander plants. This was further confirmed by the experimental finding that microgravity also prevented the response of bystander plants to exogenous methyl jasmonate (JA) and methyl salicylate (SA), two well-known airborne signaling molecules, and down-regulated JA and SA biosynthesis in UV-C-irradiated plants.",

Ionizing radiation can lead to various forms of cytogenetic damage, including increased frequencies of micronuclei (MNi) and chromosome abnormalities. The cytokinesis block micronucleus (CBMN) assay is widely used method for measuring MNi to determine chromosome mutations or genome instability in cultured human lymphocytes. The visual scoring of MNi is time-consuming and scorer fatigue can lead to inconsistency. In this work, we designed software for the scoring of in vitro CBMN assay for biomonitoring on Giemsa-stained slides that overcome many previous limitations. Automatic scoring proceeds in four stages as follows. First, overall segmentation of nuclei is done. Then, binucleated (BN) cells are detected. Next, the entire cell is estimated for each BN as it is assumed that there is no detectable cytoplasm. Finally, MNi are detected within each BN cell. The designed Software is even able to detect BN cells with vague cytoplasm and MNi in peripheral blood smear. Our system is tested on a self-provided dataset and is achieved high sensitivities of about 98% and 82% in recognizing BN cells and MNi, respectively. Moreover, in our study less than 1% false positives were observed that makes our system reliable for practical MNi scoring.",

Unfortunately, they become inactive due to resistance caused by new mutations in patients, and previous studies have also reported noticeable differences in inhibitor binding to distinct known driver mutants as well. Hence, there is a high demand for identification of EGFR mutation-specific inhibitors. In our present study, we derived a set of anti-cancer compounds with biological activities against eight typical EGFR known driver mutations and developed quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for each separately. The compounds are grouped based on their functional scaffolds, which enhanced the correlation between compound features and respective biological activities.

Five CESC mutational signatures were deciphered from 44,206 somatic mutations of 194 exomes. Three BLCA mutational signatures were very similar to the three CESC signatures. These mutational signatures exhibited common endogenous mutational processes during BLCA and CESC development. The respective BLCA and CESC mutational signature 4 revealed the role of viral infection in both cancers. Noticeably, CESC mutational signature 4 is a novel one that has not been described in other studies.

Induction and repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in terms of gamma-H2AX positive cells were analysed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using flow cytometry. Induction of DSBs was studied at low (0.25\u00a0Gy) and high challenge doses (1.0 and 2.0\u00a0Gy) of gamma radiation in 78 individuals {NLNRA, N\u00a0=\u00a023; HLNRA (LDG, N\u00a0=\u00a021 and HDG, N\u00a0=\u00a034)}.

The biomarker comprises 65 genes that can classify chemicals as DNA damaging or non-DNA damaging. In this study, we applied the TGx-28.65 genomic biomarker in parallel with the in vitro micronucleus (MN) assay to determine if two chemicals of regulatory interest at Health Canada, disperse orange (DO: the orange azo dye 3-[[4-[(4-Nitrophenyl)azo]phenyl] benzylamino]propanenitrile) and 1,2,4-benzenetriol (BT: a metabolite of benzene) are genotoxic or non-genotoxic. Both chemicals caused dose-dependent declines in relative survival and increases in apoptosis. A strong significant increase in MN induction was observed for all concentrations of BT; the top two concentrations of DO also caused a statistically significant increase in MN, but these increases were <2-fold above controls. TGx-28.65 analysis classified BT as genotoxic at all three concentrations and DO as genotoxic at the mid and high concentrations. Thus, although DO only caused a small increase in MN, this response was sufficient to induce a cellular DNA damage response. Benchmark dose modeling confirmed that BT is much more potent than DO. The results strongly suggest that follow-up work is required to assess whether DO and BT are also genotoxic in vivo. This is particularly important for DO, which may require metabolic activation by bacterial gut flora to fully induce its genotoxic potential. Our previously published data and this proof of concept study suggest that the TGx-28.65 genomic biomarker has the potential to add significant value to existing approaches used to assess genotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most deleterious DNA lesions. Appropriate repair of DSB either by homologous recombination or non-homologous end-joining is critical for maintaining genome stability and fitness. DSB repair cooperates with cellular signalling networks, namely DSB response (DDR), which plays pivotal roles in the choice of DSB repair pathway, orchestrating recruitment of DDR factors to site of damage, transcription suppression and cell cycle checkpoint activation. It has been revealed that these mechanisms are strictly regulated, in time and space, by complex and minute ubiquitylation-mediated reactions. Furthermore, balancing the ubiquitylation status of the DDR and DSB repair proteins by deubiquitylation, which is carried out by deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs), is also found to be important. Recent findings have uncovered that DUBs are involved in various aspects of both DDR and DSB repair by counteracting non-proteolytic ubiquitylations in addition to protecting substrates from proteasomal degradation by removing proteolytic ubiquitylation. An advanced understanding of the detailed molecular mechanisms of the \u201cbalancing act\u201d between ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation will provide novel therapeutic targets for diseases caused by dysfunction of DDR and DSB repair.",

     "abstract": "A DNA double-strand break (DSB) is considered to be a critical DNA lesion because its misrepair can cause severe mutations, such as deletions or chromosomal translocations. For the precise repair of DSBs, the repair pathway that is optimal for the particular circumstance needs to be selected. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) functions in G1/S/G2 phase, while homologous recombination (HR) becomes active only in S/G2 phase after DNA replication. DSB end structure is another factor affecting the repair pathway. For example, one-ended DSBs in S phase are mainly repaired by HR due to the lack of a partner DSB end for NHEJ. In contrast, two-ended DSBs, which are mainly induced by ionizing radiation, are repaired by either NHEJ or HR in G2 cells. Under the current model in terms of DSB repair pathway usage in G2 phase, NHEJ repairs \u223c70% of two-ended DSBs, whereas HR repairs only \u223c30%. Recent studies propose that NHEJ factors can bind all the DSB ends and are then either used to progress that pathway of DSB repair, or the repair proceeds by HR. In addition, molecular regulation by BRCA1 and 53BP1 has also been proposed. At DSB sites, BRCA1 functions to alleviate the 53BP1 barrier to resection by promoting 53BP1 dephosphorylation, followed by RIF1 release and 53BP1 repositioning. This timely 53BP1 repositioning may be important for the establishment of a chromatin environment that promotes the recruitment of EXO1 for resection in HR. This review summarizes current knowledge on factors regulating DSB repair pathway choice in terms of spatiotemporal regulation by focusing on the repair events at two-ended DSBs in G2 cells.",

     "abstract": "Genomic DNA is damaged at an extremely high frequency by both endogenous and environmental factors. An improper response to DNA damage can lead to genome instability, accelerate the aging process and ultimately cause various human diseases, including cancers and neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms that underlie the cellular DNA damage response (DDR) are complex and are regulated at many levels, including at the level of post-translational modification (PTM). Since the discovery of ubiquitin in 1975 and ubiquitylation as a form of PTM in the early 1980s, a number of ubiquitin-like modifiers (UBLs) have been identified, including small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs), neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8), interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-F adjacent transcript 10 (FAT10), ubiquitin-fold modifier 1 (UFRM1), URM1 ubiquitin-related modifier-1 (URM1), autophagy-related protein 12 (ATG12), autophagy-related protein 8 (ATG8), fan ubiquitin-like protein 1 (FUB1) and histone mono-ubiquitylation 1 (HUB1). All of these modifiers have known roles in the cellular response to various forms of stress, and delineating their underlying molecular mechanisms and functions is fundamental in enhancing our understanding of human disease and longevity. To date, however, the molecular mechanisms and functions of these UBLs in the DDR remain largely unknown. This review summarizes the current status of PTMs by UBLs in the DDR and their implication in cancer diagnosis, therapy and drug discovery.",

     "abstract": "Radiation therapy is one of the first-line treatments for many cancers, with no less than half of cancer patients receiving it in the US. Despite the development of innovative and high-precision radiation therapy strategies, many patients still experience local tumor recurrence after the treatment, at least in part, due to the existence of radioresistant cells in malignant tumor tissues. Among the various biological processes known to induce radioresistance, a post-translational protein modification, ubiquitination, has received marked attention in recent years. Ubiquitination, in which highly conserved ubiquitin polypeptides are covalently attached to their target proteins, has long been recognized as a system to tag unnecessary proteins for 26S proteasome-dependent proteolysis. However, accumulating lines of evidence recently revealed that it acts as a signal molecule in diverse biological processes as well, and its functional disorder was found to cause not only tumor development and various diseases but also tumor radioresistance. The present review summarizes the latest knowledge about how the cancer-related disorder of the ubiquitination systems induces the radioresistance of cancer cells by influencing intrinsic pathways, each of which potentially affects the radioresistance/radiosensitivity of cells, such as DNA damage responses, cell cycle regulation, hypoxic responses, and antioxidant properties. In addition, this review aims to provide insights into how we can exploit the disorders in order to develop novel radiosensitizing strategies.",

     "abstract": "DNA damage tolerance pathways, which include translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and template switching, are crucial for prevention of DNA replication arrest and maintenance of genomic stability. However, these pathways utilize error-prone DNA polymerases or template exchange between sister DNA strands, and consequently have the potential to induce mutations or chromosomal rearrangements.Post-translational modifications of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) play important roles in controlling these pathways. For example, TLS is mediated by mono-ubiquitination of PCNA at lysine 164, for which RAD6\u2013RAD18 is the primary E2\u2013E3 complex. Elaborate protein\u2013protein interactions between mono-ubiquitinated PCNA and Y-family DNA polymerases constitute the core of the TLS regulatory system, and enhancers of PCNA mono-ubiquitination and de-ubiquitinating enzymes finely regulate TLS and suppress TLS-mediated mutagenesis. The template switching pathway is promoted by K63-linked poly-ubiquitination of PCNA at lysine 164. Poly-ubiquitination is achieved by a coupled reaction mediated by two sets of E2\u2013E3 complexes, RAD6\u2013RAD18 and MMS2\u2013UBC13\u2013HTLF/SHPRH. In addition to these mono- and poly-ubiquitinations, simultaneous mono-ubiquitinations on multiple units of the PCNA homotrimeric ring promote an unidentified damage tolerance mechanism that remains to be fully characterized. Furthermore, SUMOylation of PCNA in mammalian cells can negatively regulate recombination. Other modifications, including ISGylation, acetylation, methylation, or phosphorylation, may also play roles in DNA damage tolerance and control of genomic stability.",

The present study investigated propagation of RIBE signals between human lung carcinoma A549 cells and normal lung fibroblast WI38 cells in bystander cells, either directly or indirectly contacting irradiated A549 cells. We prepared A549-GFP/WI38 co-cultures and A549-GFP/A549 co-cultures, in which A549-GFP cells stably expressing H2BGFP were co-cultured with either A549 cells or WI38 cells, respectively. Using the SPICE-NIRS microbeam, only the A549-GFP cells were irradiated with 500 protons per cell. The level of \u03b3-H2AX, a marker for DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), was subsequently measured for up to 24\u00a0h post-irradiation in three categories of cells: (1) \u201ctargeted\u201d/irradiated A549-GFP cells; (2) \u201cneighboring\u201d/non-irradiated cells directly contacting the \u201ctargeted\u201d cells; and (3) \u201cdistant\u201d/non-irradiated cells, which were not in direct contact with the \u201ctargeted\u201d cells. We found that DSB repair in targeted A549-GFP cells was enhanced by co-cultured WI38 cells. The bystander response in A549-GFP/A549 cell co-cultures, as marked by \u03b3-H2AX levels at 8\u00a0h post-irradiation, showed a decrease to non-irradiated control level when approaching 24\u00a0h, while the neighboring/distant bystander WI38 cells in A549-GFP/WI38 co-cultures was maintained at a similar level until 24\u00a0h post-irradiation. Surprisingly, distant A549-GFP cells in A549-GFP/WI38 co-cultures showed time dependency similar to bystander WI38 cells, but not to distant cells in A549-GFP/A549 co-cultures. These observations indicate that \u03b3-H2AX was induced in WI38 cells as a result of RIBE. WI38 cells were not only involved in rescue of targeted A549, but also in the modification of RIBE against distant A549-GFP cells. The present results demonstrate that radiation-induced bi-directional signaling had extended a profound influence on cellular sensitivity to radiation as well as the sensitivity to RIBE.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxanthine (Hx) is a major DNA lesion generated by deamination of adenine during chronic inflammatory conditions, which is an underlying cause of various diseases including cancer of colon, liver, pancreas, bladder and stomach. There is evidence that deamination of DNA bases induces mutations, but no study has directly linked Hx accumulation to mutagenesis and strand-specific mutations yet in human cells.Using a site-specific mutagenesis approach, we report the first direct evidence of mutation potential and pattern of Hx in live human cells. We investigated Hx-induced mutations in human nonmalignant HEK293 and cancer HCT116 cell lines and found that Hx is mutagenic in both HEK293 and HCT116 cell lines. There is a strand bias for Hx-mediated mutations in both the cell lines; the Hx in lagging strand is more mutagenic than in leading strand. There is also some difference in cell types regarding the strand bias for mutation types; HEK293 cells showed largely deletion (>80%) mutations in both leading and lagging strand and the rest were insertions and A:T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0G:C transition mutations in leading and lagging strands, respectively, whereas in HCT116 cells we observed 60% A:T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0G:C transition mutations in the leading strand and 100% deletions in the lagging strand. Overall, Hx is a highly mutagenic lesion capable of generating A:T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0G:C transitions and large deletions with a significant variation in leading and lagging strands in human cells. In recent meta-analysis study A\u00a0\u2192\u00a0G (T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0C) mutations were found to be a prominent signature in a variety of cancers, including a majority types that are induced by inflammation. The deletions are known to be a major cause of copy-number variations or CNVs, which is a major underlying cause of many human diseases including mental illness, developmental disorders and cancer. Thus, Hx, a major DNA lesion induced by different deamination mechanisms, has potential to initiate inflammation-driven carcinogenesis in addition to various human pathophysiological consequences.",

The exposed hazards included isopropanol (IPO), lead, noise, video display terminals (VDT), lead in a high-temperature (high-temp) environment, and IPO in a high-temp environment.

Linear regression models were used to test DNA damage differences between exposed groups and control group with adjustments for potential confounding factors. The level of DNA damage was more significant in both lead in a high-temp and IPO in a high-temp environment groups than in that of the controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The differences remained significant after stratifying by smoking status (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Recently, priority has been given to the study of high-charge and high-energy (HZE) ions that comprise a substantial part of the galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spectra that would be encountered during long-term space flights. Moreover, predictions of the delayed genetic effects of high linear energy transfer (LET) exposure is becoming more important as heavy ion therapy use is increasing. This work focuses mainly on the basic research on the delayed effects of HZE ions on V79 Chinese hamster cells, with emphasis on the induction of HPRT mutations after prolonged expression times (ET). The research was conducted under various irradiation conditions with accelerated ions 18O (E\u00a0=\u00a035.2\u00a0MeV/n), 20Ne (E\u00a0=\u00a047.7\u00a0MeV/n and 51.8\u00a0MeV/n), and 11B (E\u00a0=\u00a032.4\u00a0MeV/n), with LET in the range from 49 to 149 keV/\u03bcm and with 60Co \u03b3-rays. The HPRT mutant fractions (MF) were detected in irradiated cells in regular intervals during every cell culture recultivation (every 3\u00a0days) up to approximately 40\u00a0days (70\u201380 generations) after irradiation. The MF maximum was reached at different ET depending on ionizing radiation characteristics. The position of the maximum was shifting towards longer ET with increasing LET. We speculate that the delayed mutations are created de novo and that they are the manifestation of genomic instability. Although the exact mechanisms involved in genomic instability initiation are yet to be identified, we hypothesize that differences in induction of delayed mutations by radiations with various LET values are related to variations in energy deposition along the particle track. A dose dependence of mutation yield is discussed as well.",

In Huntington disease (HD), the age of onset of symptoms is inversely correlated to the number of CAG repeats within exon 1 of the HTT gene. HD shows paternal anticipation as CAG repeats are increased during spermatogenesis. CAG expansion were indeed found to be generated during the chromatin remodeling in spermatids where most histones are evicted and replaced by protamines. This process involves striking change in DNA topology since free supercoils must be eliminated. Using an in vitro CAG repeat reporter assay and a highly active nuclear extracts from spermatids, we demonstrate that free negative supercoils result in CAG TNR expansion at a stabilized hairpin. We also suggest a possible role for protamines in promoting localized torsional stress and consequently TNR expansion. The transient increase in torsional stress during spermiogenesis may therefore provide an ideal context for the generation of such secondary DNA structures leading to the paternal anticipation of trinucleotidic diseases.",

The somatic mutations (recessive mutation and white mutation events) were mostly linked to the concentration of Al, Ni, As, Co and Pb in Artanish, Tsapatakh and Karchaghbyur, Noradus, Martuni and Litchk, while morphological changes (non-surviving hairs) were related to Co level in Tsapatakh and Karchaghbyur. The results obtained show that Lake Sevan contains substances which may cause genotoxicity and teratogenicity in Tradescantia and probably also in aquatic animals. The results also show that Trad-SHM assay can be used for monitoring natural resources.",

     "abstract": "Hereditary hearing loss is characterized by a very high genetic heterogeneity. In the Qatari population the role of GJB2, the worldwide HHL major player, seems to be quite limited compared to Caucasian populations. In this study we analysed 18 Qatari families affected by non-syndromic hearing loss using a targeted sequencing approach that allowed us to analyse 81 genes simultaneously. Thanks to this approach, 50% of these families (9 out of 18) resulted positive for the presence of likely causative alleles in 6 different genes: CDH23, MYO6, GJB6, OTOF, TMC1 and OTOA. In particular, 4 novel alleles were detected while the remaining ones were already described to be associated to HHL in other ethnic groups. Molecular modelling has been used to further investigate the role of novel alleles identified in CDH23 and TMC1 genes demonstrating their crucial role in Ca2+ binding and therefore possible functional role in proteins. Present study showed that an accurate molecular diagnosis based on next generation sequencing technologies might largely improve molecular diagnostics outcome leading to benefits for both genetic counseling and definition of recurrence risk.",

     "abstract": "The emergence of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii within hospitals poses a significant threat to patients. The inherent rate of mutation of these strains has not been described nor has the mechanism by which drug resistance arises.Here, we determined the spontaneous mutation rates in 93 clinical strains of A. baumannii using fluctuation analysis. To rule out the clonal relatedness of hypermutator strains, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was conducted. Using a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the differentially expressed proteins of a hypermutator and a reference strain were identified.The spontaneous mutation rate of multi-drug resistant A. baumannii strains varied broadly from 0 to 2.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 mutation per cell division. The mutation rate in three multidrug resistant A. baumannii (MDR-AB) strains was found to be 1.63\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126\u20132\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126), 2.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 (95% CI: 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126 \u2212 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126), and 1.78\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128 (95% CI: 9.29\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129 2.95\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128), consistent with a hypermutator phenotype. This rate is approximately 1000-fold higher than the average mutation rate in other MDR-ABs. PFGE of the three hypermutator strains indicate that they belong to distinct clones. Proteomic analysis of one hypermutator strain revealed 31 differentially expressed proteins including three with sizes of 51.2, 20.9, and 11.9\u00a0kDa, which corresponded to a serine protease, a polyisoprenoid-binding protein, and the peptidoglycan binding protein, LysM. The serine protease was expressed only in the hypermutator strain, whereas the polyisoprenoid-binding protein and the peptidoglycan binding protein LysM were down-regulated 1.6 and 3-fold, respectively, in the hypermutators strain.Hypermutator A. baumannii strains occur with a low, but appreciable frequency among clinical multi-drug resistant isolates. The presence of hypermutator clinical isolates raises concerns that they may contribute to the failure of antibiotic treatment in infected patients and confound the interpretation of in vitro antibiotic susceptibility testing. The differentially expressed proteins involved in biofilm suppression and oxidative stress response, may represent adaptations derived from the hypermutator phenotype, a hypothesis that needs further testing.",

We propose that omics approaches and functional assays can be integrated into population studies that fuse basic, translational and clinical research with commercial expertise in order to accelerate personalized prevention and treatment of cancer and other diseases linked to aberrant responses to DNA damage. This collaborative approach is generally applicable to efforts to develop data-driven, individualized prevention and treatment strategies for other diseases.

In addition, the effect of RF exposure was examined on 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-dexoyguanosine (8-OHdG) which is a biomarker for oxidative damage and on the mitochondrial synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) which is the energy required for cellular functions. The results indicated a significant increase in ROS and significant decreases in mitochondrial transcription factor A, mtDNA polymerase gamma, mtDNA transcripts and mtDNA copy number in RF-exposed cells compared with those in sham-exposed control cells. In addition, there was a significant increase in 8-OHdG and a significant decrease in ATP in RF-exposed cells. The response in positive control cells exposed to gamma radiation (GR, which is also known to induce ROS) was similar to those in RF-exposed cells. Thus, the overall data indicated that RF exposure was capable of inducing mtDNA damage mediated through ROS pathway which also induced oxidative damage. Prior-treatment of RF- and GR-exposed the cells with melatonin, a well-known free radical scavenger, reversed the effects observed in RF-exposed cells.",

     "abstract": "Unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by ionizing radiation are associated with lethal effects and genomic instability. After the initial breaks and chromatin destabilization, a set of post-translational modifications of histones occurs, including phosphorylation of serine 139 of histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX), which leads to the formation of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF). DSB repair results in the disappearance of most IRIF within hours after exposure, although some remain 24\u00a0h after irradiation. Their relation to unrepaired DSBs is generally accepted but still controversial. This study evaluates the frequency and kinetics of persistent IRIF and analyzes their impact on cell proliferation. We observed persistent IRIF up to 7 days postirradiation, and more than 70% of cells exposed to 5\u00a0Gy had at least one of these persistent IRIF 24\u00a0h after exposure. Moreover we demonstrated that persistent IRIF did not block cell proliferation definitively. The frequency of IRIF was lower in daughter cells, due to asymmetric distribution of IRIF between some of them. We report a positive association between the presence of IRIF and the likelihood of DNA missegregation. Hence, the structure formed after the passage of a persistent IRI focus across the S and G2 phases may impede the correct segregation of the affected chromosome's sister chromatids. The ensuing abnormal resolution of anaphase might therefore cause the nature of IRIF in daughter-cell nuclei to differ before and after the first cell division. The resulting atypical chromosomal assembly may be lethal or result in a gene dosage imbalance and possibly enhanced genomic instability, in particular in the daughter cells.",

     "abstract": "Sublines of the major P. aeruginosa reference strain PAO1 are derivatives of the original PAO1 isolate, which are maintained in laboratories worldwide. These sublines display substantial genomic and phenotypic variation due to ongoing microevolution. Here, we examined four sublines, MPAO1, PAO1-L, PAO1-DSM and PAO1-UT, originated from different laboratories, and six DNA polymerase-deficient mutants from the P. aeruginosa MPAO1 transposon library for their employment in elucidation of DNA damage repair and tolerance mechanisms in P. aeruginosa. We found that PAO1 subline PAO1-UT carries a large deletion encompassing the DNA damage inducible imuA-imuB-imuC cassette (PA0669-PA0671), which is implied in mutagenesis in several species. Furthermore, the genetic changes leading to variation in the functionality of the MexEF-OprN efflux system contributed largely to the phenotypic discordance between P. aeruginosa PAO1 sublines. Specifically, we identified multiple mutations in the mexT gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator of the mexEF-oprN genes, mutations in the mexF, and complete absence of these genes. Of the four tested sublines, MPAO1 was the only subline with the functional MexEF-OprN multidrug efflux system. Active efflux through MexEF-OprN rendered MPAO1 highly resistant to chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin. Moreover, the functions of specialized DNA polymerase IV and nucleotide excision repair (NER) in 4-NQO-induced DNA damage tolerance appeared to be masked in MPAO1, while were easily detectable in other sublines. Finally, the frequencies of spontaneous and MMS-induced Rifr mutations were also significantly lower in MPAO1 in comparison to the PAO1 sublines with impaired MexEF-OprN efflux system. The MexEF-OprN-attributed differences were also observed between MPAO1 and MPAO1-derived transposon mutants from the two-allele transposon mutant collection. Thus, the accumulating mutations and discordant phenotypes of the PAO1 derivatives challenge the reproducibility and comparability of the results obtained with different PAO1 sublines and also limit the usage of the MPAO1 transposon library in DNA damage tolerance and mutagenesis studies.",

In the present study the effect of different crystal phases of TiO2-np (anatase, rutile and anatase: rutile mixture; 20\u201326\u00a0nm) were studied for cyto-genotoxicity and global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation. Cytotoxic response was observed at a concentration of 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for the particles tested. Results of comet and micronucleus (with and without CytB) assays revealed significant genotoxic effect of these particles. Flow cytometry revealed cell cycle arrest in the S-phase. Based on the results, toxicity of the particles could be correlated with their physico-chemical properties (i.e. smaller size and hydrodynamic diameter and larger surface area), anatase form being the most toxic. From the results of the cyto-genotoxicity assays, concentrations were determined for the epigenetic study. Effect on global DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation levels were studied at cyto-genotoxic (25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), genotoxic (12.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and sub cyto-genotoxic (3.25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) concentrations using LC\u2013MS/MS analysis. Though no significant changes were observed for 3\u00a0h treatment schedule; significant hypomethylation were observed at 24\u00a0h for anatase (significant at 3.25 and 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), rutile (significant at 3.25 and 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) and anatase: rutile mixture (significant at 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) forms.

We used quantitative RT-PCR to measure BRCA1 and NBR2 transcript levels in 0% and 1% oxygen in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and found that NBR2 transcript levels increased as a function of time under hypoxic conditions, whereas BRCA1 mRNA levels were repressed. Hypoxic conditions were ineffective in reducing BRCA1 mRNA in the UACC-3199 breast cancer cell line, which is reported to have an epigenetically silenced BRCA1 promoter, even though appreciable levels of BRCA1 and NBR2 mRNA were detected. Significant recovery back to baseline RNA levels occurred within 48\u00a0h after the MCF-7 cells were restored to normoxic conditions. We used a construct with the 218\u00a0bp minimal BRCA1 promoter linked to marker genes to show that this minimal promoter repressed expression bidirectionally under hypoxic conditions, which suggests that the elements necessary for induction of NBR2 are located elsewhere.",

     "abstract": "Space particles have an inevitable impact on organisms during space missions; radio-adaptive response (RAR) is a critical radiation effect due to both low-dose background and sudden high-dose radiation exposure during solar storms. Although it is relevant to consider RAR within the context of microgravity, another major space environmental factor, there is no existing evidence as to its effects on RAR. In the present study, we established an experimental method for detecting the effects of gamma-irradiation on the primary root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana, in which RAR of root growth was significantly induced by several dose combinations. Microgravity was simulated using a two-dimensional rotation clinostat. It was shown that RAR of root growth was significantly inhibited under the modeled microgravity condition, and was absent in pgm-1 plants that had impaired gravity sensing in root tips. These results suggest that RAR could be modulated in microgravity. Time course analysis showed that microgravity affected either the development of radio-resistance induced by priming irradiation, or the responses of plants to challenging irradiation. After treatment with the modeled microgravity, attenuation in priming irradiation-induced expressions of DNA repair genes (AtKu70 and AtRAD54), and reduced DNA repair efficiency in response to challenging irradiation were observed. In plant roots, the polar transportation of the phytohormone auxin is regulated by gravity, and treatment with an exogenous auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) prevented the induction of RAR of root growth, suggesting that auxin might play a regulatory role in the interaction between microgravity and RAR of root growth.",

However, the role of glutathione (GSH), a major cellular thiol, in regulating cell\u2019s sensitivity to DNA damaging agents is not well understood. Influence of endogenous GSH on the efficiency of X-rays and bleomycin (Blem) induced DNA DSBs end-joining has been tested here cytogenetically, in human lymphocytes and Hct116 cells. In another approach, oligomeric DNA (75\u00a0bp) containing 5\u2032-compatible and non-compatible overhangs mimicking the endogenous DSB were for rejoining in presence of cell-free extracts from cells having different endogenous GSH levels. Frequency of aberrations, particularly exchange aberrations, was significantly increased when Blem was combined with radiation. The exchange aberration frequency was further enhanced when combined treatment was given at 4\u00a0\u00b0C since DNA lesions are poorly repaired at 4\u00a0\u00b0C so that a higher number of DNA breaks persist and interact when shifted from 4\u00a0\u00b0C to 37\u00a0\u00b0C. The exchange aberrations increased further when the combined treatment was given to Glutathione-ester (GE) pre-treated cells, indicating more frequent rejoining of DNA lesions in presence of higher cellular GSH. This is further supported by the drastic reduction in frequency of exchange aberrations but significant increase in incidences of deletions when combined treatment was given to GSH-depleted cells. End-joining efficiency of DNA DSBs with compatible ends was better than for non-compatible ends. End-joining efficiency of testicular and MCF7 cell extracts was better than that of lungs and Hct116 cells. Cell extract made from GE-treated MCF-7 cells provided more efficient end-joining than from untreated and GSH-depleted cells. However, direct addition of GSH to the cell-free extracts showed considerable reduction in end-joining efficiency. Present data indicate that higher endogenous GSH favours rejoining of DNA DSBs (both restitution and illegitimate reunion) which in turn produce more exchange aberrations.",

Thus, we studied the synergistic effects on transcriptional changes in the global genome and DNA damage response (DDR) by using dys-1 mutant and ced-1 mutant of C. elegans, which respectively presented microgravity-insensitivity and radiosensitivity when exposure to spaceflight condition (SF) and space radiation (SR). The dys-1 mutation induced similar transcriptional changes under both conditions, including the transcriptional distribution and function of altered genes. The majority of alterations were related to metabolic shift under both conditions, including transmembrane transport, lipid metabolic processes and proteolysis. Under SF and SR conditions, 12/14 and 10/13 altered pathways, respectively, were both grouped in the metabolism category. Out of the 778 genes involved in DDR, except eya-1 and ceh-34, 28 altered genes in dys-1 mutant showed no predicted protein interactions, or anti-correlated miRNAs during spaceflight. The ced-1 mutation induced similar changes under SF and SR; however, these effects were stronger than those of the dys-1 mutant. The additional genes identified were related to phosphorous/phosphate metabolic processes and growth rather than, metabolism, especially for environmental information processing under SR. Although the DDR profiles were significantly changed under both conditions, the ced-1 mutation favored DNA repair under SF and apoptosis under SR. Notably, 37 miRNAs were predicted to be involved in the DDR. Our study indicates that, the dys-1 mutation reduced the transcriptional response to SF, and the ced-1 mutation increased the response to SR, when compared with the wild type C. elegans. Although some effects were due to radiosensitivity, microgravity, depending on the dystrophin, exerts predominant effects on transcription in C. elegans during short-duration spaceflight.",

However, whether extracellular cfNAs that are released into circulation from dying cells as a consequence of normal physiology have any functional significance has not been explored.

Fluorescently-labeled cfNAs isolated from sera of cancer patients and healthy volunteers were shown to be readily taken up by host cells followed by activation of a DNA-damage-repair-response which led their large scale integration into the host cell genomes. The latter caused dsDNA breaks and apoptosis in cells in vitro and in those of vital organs when injected intravenously into mice. Cell-free chromatin was consistently more active than cell-free DNA, while cfNAs derived from cancer patients were significantly more active than those from healthy volunteers. This study suggests that circulating extracellular cfNAs act as physiological continuously arising DNA mutagens with implications for ageing, cancer and a host of other degenerative human pathologies.",

After screening with a high-throughput resazurin-based assay and determining radiation survival with triplicate clonogenic assays, we identified 76 strains (and associated deleted genes) showing statistically-significant increased radiation sensitivity compared to a control strain. To determine gene novelty, we constructed a reference database comprised of genes found in nine similar studies including ours. This database contains 455 genes comprised of 103 common genes (found 2\u20137 times), and 352 uncommon genes (found once). Our 76 genes includes 43 common genes and 33 uncommon (potentially novel) genes, i.e., appY, atoS, betB, bglJ, clpP, cpxA, cysB, cysE, ddlA, dgkA, dppF, dusB, elfG, eutK, fadD, glnA, groL, guaB, intF, prpR, queA, rplY, seqA, sufC,yadG, yagJ, yahD, yahO, ybaK, ybfA, yfaL, yhjV, and yiaL. Of our 33 uncommon gene mutants, 4 (12%) were sensitive only to UV-radiation, 10 (30%) only to X-radiation, and 19 (58%) to both radiations. Our uncommon mutants vs. our common mutants showed more radiation specificity, i.e., 12% vs. 9% (sensitive only to UV-); 30% vs. 16% (X-) and 58% vs. 74% (both radiations). Considering just our radiation-sensitive mutants, the median UV-radiation survival (75\u00a0J\u00a0m\u22122) for 23 uncommon mutants was 6.84E-3 compared to 1.85E-3 for 36 common mutants (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025). Similarly, the average X-radiation survival for 29 uncommon mutants was 1.08E-2, compared to 6.19E-3 for 39 common mutants (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010). Comparing gene functions using MultiFun terms, uncommon genes tended to show less involvement in DNA repair-relevant categories (information transfer and cell processes), but greater involvement in seven other categories. Our analysis of 455 genes suggests cell survival and DNA repair processes are more complex than previously understood, and may be compromised by deficiencies in other processes.",

     "abstract": "Escherichia coli cells deleted for the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (Crp) gene (\u0394crp) cannot utilize glycerol because cAMP-Crp is a required activator of the glycerol utilization operon, glpFK. We have previously shown that a transposon, Insertion Sequence 5 (IS5), can insert into the upstream regulatory region of the operon to activate the glpFK promoter and enable glycerol utilization. GlpR, which represses glpFK transcription, binds to the glpFK upstream region near the site of IS5 insertion and inhibits insertion. By adding cAMP to the culture medium in \u0394cyaA cells, we here show that the cAMP-Crp complex, which also binds to the glpFK upstream regulatory region, inhibits IS5 hopping into the activating site. Control experiments showed that the frequencies of mutations in response to cAMP were independent of parental cell growth rate and the selection procedure. These findings led to the prediction that glpFK-activating IS5 insertions can also occur in wild-type (Crp+) cells under conditions that limit cAMP production. Accordingly, we found that IS5 insertion into the activating site in wild-type cells is elevated in the presence of glycerol and a non-metabolizable sugar analogue that lowers cytoplasmic cAMP concentrations. The resultant IS5 insertion mutants arising in this minimal medium become dominant constituents of the population after prolonged periods of growth. The results show that DNA binding transcription factors can reversibly mask a favored transposon target site, rendering a hot spot for insertion less favored. Such mechanisms could have evolved by natural selection to overcome environmental adversity.",

Most studies have focused on analyzing total micronuclei (MN), but identifying the content of MN can provide more detailed information. The main aim of this study was to map the factors affecting the frequency and types of micronuclei in binucleated cells (BNC) in elderly population. Fluorescence in situ hybridization using Human Pan Centromeric Chromosome Paint was used to identify centromere positive (CEN+) or centromere negative (CEN-) MN. A group of 95 men from Southern Bohemia, Czech Republic (average age 68.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.8 years) was followed repeatedly, in spring and fall 2014. The study participants were former workers of the uranium plant \u201cMAPE Mydlovary\u201d (processing uranium ore from 1962 to 1991), and controls. The general profile of individual types of MN, and the effect of the season, former uranium exposure, age, smoking status, weight, and X-ray examination on the level and type of MN were analyzed. The results of this study showed: (i) a stable profile of BNC with MN based on the number of MN during two seasons; (ii) an increase of the number of CEN+ MN from spring to fall; (iii) a lower frequency of the total MN in the exposed group than in controls with a significant difference in the percentage of aberrant cells (%AB.C.) in the fall; (iv) no clear effect of age, smoking and BMI on DNA damage in this group; (v) lower DNA damage levels in former uranium workers who received X-ray examination later in life. In summary, the results indicate a trend of seasonal changes of individual types of MN and suggest that former exposure can have a protective effect on the level of DNA damage in case of future exposure.",

Zebrafish embryos at 5\u00a0h post-fertilization were irradiated with X-ray (low-LET) and carbon-ion (high-LET) with or without pretreatment of CORM-3 1\u00a0h before irradiation. CORM-3 pre-treatment showed a significant inhibitory effect on X-ray irradiation-induced developmental toxicity, but had little effect on carbon-ion irradiation-induced developmental toxicity. X-ray irradiation-induced significant increase in ROS levels and cell apoptosis could be modified by CORM-3 pretreatment. However, embryos exposed to carbon-ion irradiation showed significantly increase of cell apoptosis without obvious ROS generation, which could not be attenuated by CORM-3 pretreatment. CORM-3 could inhibit apoptosis induced by ionizing radiation with low-LET as an effective ROS scavenger. The expression of pro-apoptotic genes increased significantly after X-ray irradiation, but increased expression was reduced markedly when CORM-3 was applied before irradiation. Moreover, the protein levels of P53 and \u03b3-H2AX increased markedly after X-ray irradiation, which could be modified by the presence of CORM-3. The protective effect of CORM-3 on X-ray irradiation occurred mainly by suppressing ROS generation and DNA damage, and thus inhibiting the activation of P53 and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, leading to the attenuation of cell apoptosis and consequently alleviating X-ray irradiation-induced developmental toxicity at lethal and sub-lethal levels.",

     "abstract": "Although radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE) in Arabidopsis thaliana have been well demonstrated in vivo, little is known about their underlying mechanisms, particularly with regard to the participating signaling molecules and signaling pathways. In higher plants, jasmonic acid (JA) and its bioactive derivatives are well accepted as systemic signal transducers that are produced in response to various environmental stresses. It is therefore speculated that the JA signal pathway might play a potential role in mediating radiation-induced bystander signaling of root-to-shoot. In the present study, pretreatment of seedlings with Salicylhydroxamic acid, an inhibitor of lipoxigenase (LOX) in JA biosynthesis, significantly suppressed RIBE-mediated expression of the AtRAD54 gene. After root irradiation, the aerial parts of A. thaliana mutants deficient in JA biosynthesis (aos) and signaling cascades (jar1-1) showed suppressed induction of the AtRAD54 and AtRAD51 genes and TSI and 180-bp repeats, which have been extensively used as endpoints of bystander genetic and epigenetic effects in plants. These results suggest an involvement of the JA signal pathway in the RIBE of plants. Using the root micro-grafting technique, the JA signal pathway was shown to participate in both the generation of bystander signals in irradiated root cells and radiation responses in the bystander aerial parts of plants. The over-accumulation of endogenous JA in mutant fatty acid oxygenation up-regulated 2 (fou2), in which mutation of the Two Pore Channel 1 (TPC1) gene up-regulates expression of the LOX and allene oxide synthase (AOS) genes, inhibited RIBE-mediated expression of the AtRAD54 gene, but up-regulated expression of the AtKU70 and AtLIG4 genes in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway. Considering that NHEJ is employed by plants with increased DNA damage, the switch from HR to NHEJ suggests that over-accumulation of endogenous JA might enhance the radiosensitivity of plants in terms of RIBE.",

     "abstract": "Homologous recombination is crucial in both the maintenance of genome stability and the generation of genetic diversity. Recently, multiple aspects of the recombination machinery functioning at arrested DNA replication forks have been established, yet the roles of diverse modifications of PCNA, the key platform organizing the replication complex, in intrachromosomal recombination have not been comprehensively elucidated. Here, we report how PCNA SUMOylation and/or polyubiquitination affects recombination between direct repeats in S. cerevisiae. Our results show that these PCNA modifications primarily affect gene conversion, whereas their effect on the recombination-mediated deletion of intervening sequence is much less obvious. Siz1-dependent PCNA SUMOylation strongly limits Rad52/Rad51/Rad59-dependent gene conversion. A 5- to 10-fold increase in the frequency of such recombination events is observed in Siz1-defective strains, but this increase is fully suppressed when PCNA polyubiquitination is also compromised. PCNA polyubiquitination can stimulate gene conversion in both PCNA SUMOylation-proficient and SUMOylation-deficient strains. On the other hand, in PCNA polyubiquitination-deficient strains, the lack of PCNA SUMOylation does not affect GC levels. Therefore, we postulate that the antirecombinogenic activity of Siz1 mainly concerns recombination induced by PCNA polyubiquitination. In the absence of PCNA SUMOylation, the frequency of PCNA polyubiquitination-mediated gene conversion is not only increased, but it is also channeled into the Rad59-dependent pathway. Additionally, we show a weak inhibitory effect of Rad5 on Rad52/Rad59-directed single-strand annealing.",

Recent studies have shown a link between occupational exposure to pesticides in tobacco crops and increased damage to the DNA, mononuclei, nuclear buds and binucleated cells in buccal cells as well as micronuclei in lymphocytes. Furthermore, pesticides used specifically for tobacco crops shorten telomere length (TL) significantly. However, the molecular mechanism of pesticide action on telomere length is not fully understood. Our study evaluated the interaction between a complex mixture of chemical compounds (tobacco cultivation pesticides plus nicotine) and proteins associated with maintaining TL, as well as the biological processes involved in this exposure by System Biology tools to provide insight regarding the influence of pesticide exposure on TL maintenance in tobacco farmers. Our analysis showed that one cluster was associated with TL proteins that act in bioprocesses such as (i) telomere maintenance via telomere lengthening; (ii) senescence; (iii) age-dependent telomere shortening; (iv) DNA repair (v) cellular response to stress and (vi) regulation of proteasome ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process. We also describe how pesticides and nicotine regulate telomere length. In addition, pesticides inhibit the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) and consequently increase proteins of the shelterin complex, avoiding the access of telomerase in telomere and, nicotine activates UPS mechanisms and promotes the degradation of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), decreasing telomerase activity.",

The CD cells were engineered by altering the DNA sequence encoding two amino acids essential for the catalytic activity of Pol \u03b6, i.e., D2781 and D2783, to alanines. Both Pol \u03b6 KO and CD cells displayed a prolonged cell cycle and higher incidence of micronuclei formation than the wild-type (WT) cells in the absence of exogenous genotoxic treatments, and the order of abnormality was CD\u00a0>\u00a0KO\u00a0>\u00a0WT cells. Both KO and CD cells exhibited higher sensitivity towards the killing effects of benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide, mitomycin C, potassium bromate, N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, and ultraviolet C irradiation than WT cells, and there were no differences between the sensitivities of KO and CD cells. Interestingly, neither KO nor CD cells were sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of hydrogen peroxide. Since KO and CD cells displayed similar sensitivities to the genotoxins, we employed only KO cells to further examine their sensitivity to other genotoxic agents. KO cells were more sensitive to the cytotoxicity of 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide, styrene oxide, cisplatin, methyl methanesulfonate, and ethyl methanesulfonate than WT cells. However, the KO cells displayed sensitivity camptothecin, etoposide, bleomycin, hydroxyurea, crotonealdehyde, and methylglyoxal in a manner similar to the WT cells.

The current study is the first to evaluate genomic instability, cell death and proliferative index in exfoliated buccal cells (EBC) from anesthesiologists. We also evaluated DNA damage and determined the concentrations of the anesthetic gases most commonly used in operating rooms. This study was conducted on physicians who were allocated into two groups: the exposed group, which consisted of anesthesiologists who had been exposed to waste anesthetic gases (isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane and nitrous oxide \u2212 N2O) for at least two years; and the control group, which consisted of non-exposed physicians matched for age, sex and lifestyle with the exposed group.

Basal DNA damage was evaluated in lymphocytes by the comet assay, whereas the buccal micronucleus (MN) cytome (BMCyt) assay was applied to evaluate genotoxic and cytotoxic effects. The concentrations of N2O and anesthetics were measured via a portable infrared spectrophotometer. The average concentration of waste gases was greater than 5 parts per million (ppm) for all of the halogenated anesthetics and was more than 170\u00a0ppm for N2O, expressed as a time-weighted average. There was no significant difference between the groups in relation to lymphocyte DNA damage. The exposed group had higher frequencies of MN, karyorrhexis and pyknosis, and a lower frequency of basal cells compared with the control group. In conclusion, exposure to modern waste anesthetic gases did not induce systemic DNA damage, but it did result in genomic instability, cytotoxicity and proliferative changes, which were detected in the EBC of anesthesiologists. Thus, these professionals can be considered at risk for developing genetic alterations resulting from occupational exposure to these gases, suggesting the need to minimize this exposure.",

In this case, the cfDNA concentration can be a marker of the cell death in the organism. However, a chronic exposure to a low-dose IR enhances both the endonuclease activity and titer of antibodies to DNA in blood plasma, resulting in a decrease of the total concentration of circulating cfDNA in exposed people. In this case, the total cfDNA concentration should not be considered as a marker of the cell death in an exposed body. We assumed that a pool of the cfDNA circulating in the exposed people contains DNA fragments, which are resistant to a double-strand break formation in the environment of the elevated plasma endonuclease activity, and can be accumulated in the blood plasma. In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the content of GC-rich sequences (69%GC) of the transcribed region of human ribosomal repeat (rDNA), as well as the content of AT-rich repeat (63%AT) of satellite III (1q12) in the cfDNA samples obtained from 285 individuals. We have found that a chronic exposure to gamma-neutron radiation (N\u00a0=\u00a088) and tritium \u03b2-radiation (N\u00a0=\u00a088) evokes an increase of the rDNA content (RrDNA index) and a decrease of the satellite III content (RsatIII index) in the circulating cfDNA as compared with the cfDNA of non-exposed people (N\u00a0=\u00a0109). Such index that simultaneously displays both the increase of rDNA content and decrease of satellite III content in the cfDNA (RrDNA/RsatIII) can be recommended as a marker of chronic processes in the body that involve the elevated cell death rate and/or increased blood plasma endonuclease activity.",

     "abstract": "RecQ helicases are a highly conserved family of ATP-dependent DNA-unwinding enzymes with key roles in DNA replication and repair in all kingdoms of life. The RECQ1 gene encodes the most abundant RecQ homolog in humans. We engineered full-length RECQ1 harboring point mutations in the zinc-binding motif (amino acids 419\u2013480) within the conserved RecQ-specific-C-terminal (RQC) domain known to be critical for diverse biochemical and cellular functions of RecQ helicases. Wild-type RECQ1 contains a zinc ion. Substitution of three of the four conserved cysteine residues that coordinate zinc severely impaired the ATPase and DNA unwinding activities but retained DNA binding and single strand DNA annealing activities. Furthermore, alteration of these residues attenuated zinc binding and significantly changed the overall conformation of full-length RECQ1 protein. In contrast, substitution of cysteine residue at position 471 resulted in a wild-type like RECQ1 protein. Differential contribution of the conserved cysteine residues to the structure and functions of the RECQ1 protein is also inferred by homology modeling. Overall, our results indicate that the zinc binding motif in the RQC domain of RECQ1 is a key structural element that is essential for the structure-functions of RECQ1. Given the recent association of RECQ1 mutations with breast cancer, these results will contribute to understanding the molecular basis of RECQ1 functions in cancer etiology.",

     "abstract": "Chromosome missegregation can lead to a change in chromosome number known as aneuploidy. Although aneuploidy is a known hallmark of cancer cells, the various mechanisms by which altered gene and/or DNA copy number facilitate tumorigenesis remain unclear. To understand the effect of aneuploidy occurring in non-tumorigenic human breast epithelial cells, we generated clones harboring artificial aneuploidy using microcell-mediated chromosome transfer. Our results demonstrate that clones with artificial aneuploidy of chromosome 8 or chromosome 22 both show inhibited proliferation and genomic instability. Also, the increased autophagy was observed in the artificially aneuploidy clones, and inhibition of autophagy resulted in increased genomic instability and DNA damage. In addition, the intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species were up-regulated in the artificially aneuploid clones, and inhibition of autophagy further increased the production of reactive oxygen species. Together, these results suggest that even a single extraneous chromosome can induce genomic instability, and that autophagy triggered by aneuploidy-induced stress is a mechanism to protect cells bearing abnormal chromosome number.",

     "abstract": "A combination of a photosensitizer with light of matching wavelength is a common treatment modality in various diseases including psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and tumors. DNA damage and production of reactive oxygen intermediates may impact pathological cellular functions and viability. Here we set out to investigate the role of the nuclear DNA nick sensor enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 in photochemical treatment (PCT)-induced tumor cell killing. We found that silencing PARP-1 or inhibition of its enzymatic activity with Veliparib had no significant effect on the viability of A431 cells exposed to 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) and UVA (2.5\u00a0J/cm2) indicating that PARP-1 is not likely to be a key player in either cell survival or cell death of PCT-exposed cells. Interestingly, however, another commonly used PARP inhibitor PJ-34 proved to be a photosensitizer with potency equal to 8-MOP. Irradiation of PJ-34 with UVA caused changes both in the UV absorption and in the 1H NMR spectra of the compound with the latter suggesting UVA-induced formation of tautomeric forms of the compound. Characterization of the photosensitizing effect revealed that PJ\u201334\u00a0+\u00a0UVA triggers overproduction of reactive oxygen species, induces DNA damage, activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8 and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. Cell death in this model could not be prevented by antioxidants (ascorbic acid, trolox, glutathione, gallotannin or cell permeable superoxide dismutase or catalase) but could be suppressed by inhibitors of caspase-3 and \u22128. In conclusion, PJ-34 is a photosensitizer and PJ\u201334\u00a0+\u00a0UVA causes DNA damage and caspase-mediated cell death independently of PARP-1 inhibition.",

With the aid of this assay, we conducted a genome-wide search for the factors affecting mutation frequency in P. putida. Screening \u223c27,000 transposon mutants for increased mutation frequency allowed us to identify 34 repeatedly targeted genes.

The highest effect on mutant frequency was observed when truA (tRNA pseudouridine synthase), mpl (UDP-N-acetylmuramate-alanine ligase) or gacS (multi-sensor hybrid histidine kinase) were inactivated. Inactivation of truA elevated the mutant frequency only in growing cells, while the deficiency of gacS affected mainly stationary-phase mutagenesis.

While it has been reported that plants subjected to adverse environments initiate various stress responses in their neighboring plants, little is known regarding epigenetic responses to external stresses mediated by plant\u2013plant communication. In this study, we show that DNA repetitive elements of Arabidopsis thaliana, whose expression is inhibited epigenetically by transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) mechanism, are activated by UV-C irradiation through airborne plant\u2013plant and plant\u2013plant\u2013plant communications, accompanied by DNA demethylation at CHH sites.

Further, the plant\u2013plant and plant\u2013plant\u2013plant communications are blocked by mutations in the biosynthesis or signaling of jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA), indicating that JA and SA pathways are involved in the interplant communication for epigenetic responses. For the plant\u2013plant\u2013plant communication, stress cues are relayed to the last set of receiver plants by promoting the production of JA and SA signals in relaying plants, which exhibit upregulated expression of genes for JA and SA biosynthesis and enhanced emanation of MeJA and MeSA.",

     "abstract": "The recent demonstration that massive scale chromosomal shattering or pulverization can occur abruptly due to errors induced by interference with the microtubule machinery of the mitotic spindle followed by haphazard chromosomal annealing, together with sophisticated insights from epigenetics, provide profound mechanistic insights into some of the most perplexing classical observations of addiction medicine, including cancerogenesis, the younger and aggressive onset of addiction-related carcinogenesis, the heritability of addictive neurocircuitry and cancers, and foetal malformations. Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other addictive agents have been shown to inhibit tubulin polymerization which perturbs the formation and function of the microtubules of the mitotic spindle. This disruption of the mitotic machinery perturbs proper chromosomal segregation during anaphase and causes micronucleus formation which is the primary locus and cause of the chromosomal pulverization of chromothripsis and downstream genotoxic events including oncogene induction and tumour suppressor silencing. Moreover the complementation of multiple positive cannabis-cancer epidemiological studies, and replicated dose-response relationships with established mechanisms fulfils causal criteria. This information is also consistent with data showing acceleration of the aging process by drugs of addiction including alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, stimulants and opioids. THC shows a non-linear sigmoidal dose-response relationship in multiple pertinent in vitro and preclinical genotoxicity assays, and in this respect is similar to the serious major human mutagen thalidomide. Rising community exposure, tissue storage of cannabinoids, and increasingly potent phytocannabinoid sources, suggests that the threshold mutagenic dose for cancerogenesis will increasingly be crossed beyond the developing world, and raise transgenerational transmission of teratogenicity as an increasing concern.",

In the present study, macrophage U937 cells and epithelial Beas-2B cells were co-cultured to disclose the cascades of bystander signaling factors and intercellular communications. After \u03b1-particle irradiation, both ERK and p38 pathways were activated in Beas-2B cells and were associated with the autocrine and paracrine signaling of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8, resulting in direct damage to the irradiated cells. Similar upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 was induced in the bystander U937 cells after co-culture with \u03b1-irradiated Beas-2B cells. This upregulation was dependent on the activation of NF-\u03baB pathway and was responsible for the enhanced damage of \u03b1-irradiated Beas-2B cells. Interestingly, the increased expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 mRNAs in the bystander U937 cells were clearly relayed on the activated ERK and p38 pathways in the irradiated Beas-2B cells, and the upregulation of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 mRNAs in co-cultured Beas-2B cells was also partly due to the activated NF-\u03baB pathway in the bystander U937 cells. With the pretreatment of U0126 (MEK1/2 inhibitor), SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) or BAY 11-7082 (NF-\u03baB inhibitor), the aggravated damage in the \u03b1-irradiated Beas-2B cells could be largely alleviated.

The Pig-a assay can be employed to evaluate mutant frequencies (MFs) in peripheral blood reticulocytes (RETs) and erythrocytes (RBCs) using flow cytometry. In the present study, we assessed the effects of malnutrition on mutagenic susceptibility by exposing undernourished (UN) and well-nourished (WN) rats to N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) and measuring Pig-a MFs. Two week-old UN and WN male Han-Wistar rats were treated daily with 0, 20, or 40\u00a0mg/kg ENU for 3 consecutive days. Blood was collected from the tail vein one day before ENU treatment (Day-1) and after ENU administration on Days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56 and 63. Pig-a MFs were measured in RETs and RBCs as the RETCD59\u2212 and RBCCD59\u2212 frequencies. In the vehicle control groups, the frequencies of mutant RETs and RBCs were significantly higher in UN rats compared with WN rats at all sampling times. The ENU treatments increased RET and RBC MFs starting at Day 7. Although ENU-induced Pig-a MFs were consistently lower in UN rats than in WN rats, these differences were not significant. To understand these responses, further studies should use other mutagens and nucleated surrogate cells and examine the types of mutations induced in UN and WN rats.",

The latter may contribute to the chemopreventive effects of DHA. Previous studies have shown that the levels of Acr-dG are correlated with apoptosis induction in HT29 cells treated with DHA. Because Acr-dG is shown to be repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway, to further investigate the role of Acr-dG in apoptosis, in this study, NER-deficient XPA and its isogenic NER-proficient XAN1 cells were treated with DHA. The Acr-dG levels and apoptosis were sharply increased in XPA cells, but not in XAN1 cells when treated with 125\u00a0\u03bcM of DHA. Because DHA can induce formation of various DNA damage, to specifically investigate the role of Acr-dG in apoptosis induction, we treated XPA knockdown HCT116\u00a0+\u00a0ch3 cells with acrolein. The levels of both Acr-dG and apoptosis induction increased significantly in the XPA knockdown cells. These results clearly demonstrate that NER deficiency induces higher levels of Acr-dG in cells treated with DHA or acrolein and sensitizes cells to undergo apoptosis in a correlative manner. Collectively, these results support that Acr-dG, a ubiquitously formed mutagenic oxidative DNA adduct, plays a role in DHA-induced apoptosis and suggest that it could serve as a biomarker for the cancer preventive effects of DHA.",

In this study, we aimed to assess whether or not a bystander response can be induced in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes by vincristine, a chemotherapeutic mutagen acting as spindle poison, and by mitomycin-C, an alkylating agent already known to induce this response in human lymphoblastoid cells. Designing a modified ad hoc protocol for the cytokinesis blocked micronucleus (MN) assay, we detected the presence of a dose-dependent bystander response in untreated cultures receiving the conditioned medium (CM) from mitomycin-C (MMC) or vincristine (VCR) treated cultures. In the case of MMC, MN frequencies, expressed as micronucleated binucleates, were: 13.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.41 at 6\u00a0\u03bcM, 22\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.12 at 12\u00a0\u03bcM or 28.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.13 at 15\u00a0\u03bcM vs. a control value of 4.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.59.

To verify that no mutagen residual was transferred to recipient cultures together with the CM, we evaluated MN levels in cultures receiving the medium immediately after three washings following the chemical treatment (unconditioned medium). We further confirmed these results using a cell-mixing approach where untreated lymphocytes were co-cultured with donor cells treated with an effect-inducing dose of MMC or VCR. A distinct production pattern of both reactive oxygen species and soluble mediator proteins by treated cells may account for the differences observed in the manifestation of the bystander effect induced by VCR. In fact, we observed an increased level of ROS, IL-32 and TGF-\u03b2 in the CM from VCR treated cultures, not present in MMC treated cultures.",

     "abstract": "Phages are the most abundant biological entities and influence prokaryotic communities on Earth. Comparing closely related genomes sheds light on molecular events shaping phage evolution. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) variations impart over half of the genomic changes between T7M and T3, indicating an important role of SSRs in accelerating phage genetic divergence. Differences in coding and noncoding regions of phages infecting different hosts, coliphages T7M and T3, Yersinia phage \u03d5YeO3-12, and Salmonella phage \u03d5SG-JL2, frequently arise from SSR variations. Such variations modify noncoding and coding regions; the latter efficiently changes multiple amino acids, thereby hastening protein evolution. Four classes of events are found to drive SSR variations: insertion/deletion of SSR units, expansion/contraction of SSRs without alteration of genome length, changes of repeat motifs, and generation/loss of repeats. The categorization demonstrates the ways SSRs mutate in genomes during phage evolution. Indels are common constituents of genome variations and human diseases, yet, how they occur without preexisting repeat sequence is less understood. Non-repeat-unit-based misalignment-elongation (NRUBME) is proposed to be one mechanism for indels without adjacent repeats. NRUBME or consecutive NRUBME may also change repeat motifs or generate new repeats. NRUBME invoking a non-Watson-Crick base pair explains insertions that initiate mononucleotide repeats. Furthermore, NRUBME successfully interprets many inexplicable human di- to tetranucleotide repeat generations. This study provides the first evidence of SSR variations expediting phage divergence, and enables insights into the events and mechanisms of genome evolution. NRUBME allows us to emulate natural evolution to design indels for various applications.",

Thus, we investigated DSBs repair efficiency in a group of obese adolescents assessing the kinetic of H2AX phosphorylation in mitomycin C (MMC)-treated lymphocytes harvested 2 h- or 4 h-post mutagen treatment.

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are particularly relevant to aging because of their toxicity, increased frequency with age and the association of defects in their repair with premature aging. Recent studies expand the potential impact of DNA damage and mutations on aging by linking DNA DSB repair and age-related chromatin changes. There is overwhelming evidence that increased DNA damage and mutations accelerate aging. However, an ultimate proof of causality would be to show that enhanced genome and epigenome stability delays aging.

The lowest doses for 48Ti and 56Fe ions were equivalent to a fluence of approximately 1 or 2 particle traversals per nucleus. In most cases, Aprt mutant frequencies in the irradiated mice were not significantly increased relative to the controls for any of the particles or doses tested at the pre-determined harvest time (3\u20135 months after irradiation). Despite the lack of increased Aprt mutant frequencies in the irradiated splenocytes, a molecular analysis centered on chromosome 8 revealed the induction of radiation signature mutations (large interstitial deletions and complex mutational patterns), with the highest levels of induction at 2 particles nucleus for the 48Ti and 56Fe ions. In total, the results show that densely ionizing HZE ions can induce characteristic mutations in splenic T cells at low fluence, and that at least a subset of radiation-induced mutant cells are stably retained despite the apparent lack of increased mutant frequencies at the time of harvest.",

     "abstract": "The increased threat of radiological terrorism and accidental nuclear exposures, together with increased usage of radiation-based medical procedures, has made necessary the development of minimally invasive methods for rapid identification of exposed individuals. Genetically predisposed radiosensitive individuals comprise a significant number of the population and require specialized attention and treatments after such events. Metabolomics, the assessment of the collective small molecule content in a given biofluid or tissue, has proven effective in the rapid identification of radiation biomarkers and metabolic perturbations. To investigate how the genotypic background may alter the ionizing radiation (IR) signature, we analyzed urine from Parp1\u2212/\u2212 mice, as a model radiosensitive genotype, exposed to IR by utilizing the analytical power of liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS), as urine has been thoroughly investigated in wild type (WT) mice in previous studies from our laboratory. Samples were collected at days one and three after irradiation, time points that are important for the early and efficient triage of exposed individuals. Time-dependent perturbations in metabolites were observed in the tricarboxylic acid pathway (TCA). Other differentially excreted metabolites included amino acids and metabolites associated with dysregulation of energy metabolism pathways. Time-dependent apoptotic pathway activation between WT and mutant mice following IR exposure may explain the altered excretion patterns, although the origin of the metabolites remains to be determined. This first metabolomics study in urine from radiation exposed genetic mutant animal models provides evidence that this technology can be used to dissect the effects of genotoxic agents on metabolism by assessing easily accessible biofluids and identify biomarkers of radiation exposure. Applications of metabolomics could be incorporated in the future to further elucidate the effects of IR on the metabolism of Parp1\u2212/\u2212 genotype by assessing individual tissues.",

     "abstract": "The high level natural radiation area (HLNRA) of Kerala is a 55\u00a0km long and 0.5\u00a0km wide strip in south west coast of India. The level of background radiation in this area varies from <1.0\u00a0mGy/year to 45.0\u00a0mGy/year. It offers unique opportunity to study the effect of chronic low dose/low dose-rate radiation directly on human population. Spontaneous level of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) was quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 91 random individuals from HLNRA (N\u00a0=\u00a061, mean age: 36.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.43\u00a0years) and normal level natural radiation area (NLNRA) (N\u00a0=\u00a030, mean age: 35.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.35\u00a0years) using gamma-H2AX as a marker. The mean annual dose received by NLNRA and HLNRA individuals was 1.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.086\u00a0mGy/year and 8.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.96\u00a0mGy/year, respectively. The spontaneous frequency of DSBs in terms of gamma-H2AX foci among NLNRA and HLNRA individuals were 0.095\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009 and 0.084\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004 per cell (P\u00a0=\u00a00.22). The individuals from HLNRA were further classified as low dose group (LDG, 1.51\u20135.0\u00a0mGy/year, mean dose: 2.63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.76\u00a0mGy/year) and high dose group (HDG, >5.0\u00a0mGy/year, mean dose: 11.04\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.57\u00a0mGy/year). The spontaneous frequency of gamma-H2AX foci per cell in NLNRA, LDG and HDG was observed to be 0.095\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.009, 0.096\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.008 and 0.078\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.004 respectively. Individuals belonging to HDG of HLNRA showed marginally lower frequency of DSBs as compared to NLNRA and LDG of HLNRA. This could be suggestive of either lower induction or better repair of DSBs in individuals from HDG of HLNRA. The present study indicated that 5.0\u00a0mGy/year could be a possible threshold dose for DSB induction at chronic low-dose radiation exposure in vivo. However, further studies on DNA damage induction and repair kinetics are required to draw firm conclusions.",

     "abstract": "Despite that advanced maternal age at conception represents the major risk factor for the birth of a child with Down syndrome (DS), most of DS babies are born from women aging less than 35 years. Studies performed in peripheral lymphocytes of those women revealed several markers of global genome instability, including an increased frequency of micronuclei, shorter telomeres and impaired global DNA methylation. Furthermore, young mothers of DS individuals (MDS) are at increased risk to develop dementia later in life, suggesting that they might be \u201cbiologically older\u201d than mothers of euploid babies of similar age.Mutations in folate pathway genes, and particularly in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) one, have been often associated with maternal risk for a DS birth as well as with risk of dementia in the elderly. Recent studies pointed out that also changes in MTHFR methylation levels can contribute to human disease, but nothing is known about MTHFR methylation in MDS tissues.We investigated MTHFR promoter methylation in DNA extracted from perypheral lymphocytes of 40 MDS and 44 matched control women that coinceived their children before 35 years of age, observing a significantly increased MTHFR promoter methylation in the first group (33.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.1% vs. 28.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.8%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In addition, the frequency of micronucleated lymphocytes was available from the women included in the study, was higher in MDS than control mothers (16.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6\u2030 vs. 10.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3\u2030; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0004), and correlated with MTHFR promoter methylation levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.33; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).Present data suggest that MTHFR epimutations are likely to contribute to the increased genomic instability observed in cells from MDS, and could play a role in the risk of birth of a child with DS as well as in the onset of age related diseases in those women.",

Classification of kinetochore-negative (K\u2212MNi) and kinetochore-positive micronuclei (K+MNi) improves the specificity and sensitivity of the micronucleus (MN) test; however, the fundamental differences in the origins of K\u2212MNi and K+MNi have not been addressed due to the limitations of traditional methods.In the current study, HeLa CENP B-GFP H2B-mCherry cells were constructed in which histone 2B (H2B) and centromere protein B (CENP B) were expressed as fusion proteins to monomeric Cherry (mCherry) and EGFP, respectively. MNi were identified using H2B-mCherry; K+MN contained CENP B-GFP, while K\u2212MN did not. Long-term live cell imaging was conducted to examine MN formation in the dual-color fluorescent HeLa cells. The results suggested that K\u2212MNi were derived from kinetochore-negative displaced chromosomes (K\u2212DCs), kinetochore-negative lagging chromosomes (K\u2212LCs) and fragments of broken chromosome bridges (CBs) during late mitotic stages. The results also indicated that K+MNi are derived from kinetochore-positive displaced chromosomes (K+DCs), kinetochore-positive lagging chromosomes (K+LCs), and fragments of broken CBs. Different aberrant chromosomes emerged during mitosis at different frequencies and developed into K\u2212MNi and/or K+MNi in the daughter cells at different rates. K+LCs formed K+MNi at a higher frequency than K+DCs, and K\u2212LCs formed K\u2212MNi at a higher rate than K\u2212DCs; however, broken CBs transformed into K\u2212MNi and/or K+MNi.In summary, these results show that K\u2212MNi and K+MNi have different origins in HeLa cells and that each mechanism of MN formation contributes differently to the overall number of K\u2212MNi and K+MNi.",

     "abstract": "When chemotherapy and radiotherapy are effective, they function by inducing DNA damage in cancerous cells, which respond by undergoing apoptosis. Some adverse effects can result from collateral destruction of non-cancerous cells, via the same mechanism. Therapy-related cancers, a particularly serious adverse effect of anti-cancer treatments, develop due to oncogenic mutations created in non-cancerous cells by the DNA damaging therapies used to eliminate the original cancer. Physiologically achievable concentrations of direct apoptosis inducing anti-cancer drugs that target Bcl-2 and IAP proteins possess negligible mutagenic activity, however death receptor agonists like TRAIL/Apo2L can provoke mutations in surviving cells, probably via caspase-mediated activation of the nuclease CAD. In this study we compared the types of mutations sustained in the HPRT and TK1 loci of clonogenically competent cells following treatment with TRAIL or the alkylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). As expected, the loss-of-function mutations in the HPRT or TK1 loci triggered by exposure to EMS were almost all transitions. In contrast, only a minority of the mutations identified in TRAIL-treated clones lacking HPRT or TK1 activity were substitutions. Almost three quarters of the TRAIL-induced mutations were partial or complete deletions of the HPRT or TK1 genes, consistent with sub-lethal TRAIL treatment provoking double strand breaks, which may be mis-repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Mis-repair of double-strand breaks following exposure to chemotherapy drugs has been implicated in the pathogenesis of therapy-related cancers. These data suggest that TRAIL too may provoke oncogenic damage to the genomes of surviving cells.",

Results from our laboratory showed that 7 of 10 kidney cancer patients carried a mutant H2A/K pseudogene; therefore, we were interested in determining the relationship between mutant H2A/K and cell proliferation. We used shotgun and label-free proteomics methods to study whether mutant H2A/K lncRNAs affected cell proliferation. Quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that the expression of mutant H2A/K lncRNAs resulted in the upregulation of many oncogenes, which promoted cell proliferation. Further interaction analyses revealed that a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-protein interaction network, with PCNA in the center, contributes to cell proliferation in cells expressing the mutant H2A/K lncRNAs. Western blotting confirmed the critical upregulation of PCNA by mutant H2A/K lncRNA expression. Finally, the promotion of cell proliferation by mutant H2A/K lncRNAs (C290T, C228A and A45G) was confirmed using cell proliferation assays. Although we did not determine the exact mechanism by which the oncogenes were upregulated by the mutant H2A/K lncRNAs, we confirmed that the mutant H2A/K lncRNAs promoted cell proliferation by upregulating PCNA and other oncogenes. The hypothesis that cell proliferation is promoted by the mutant H2A/K lncRNAs was supported by the protein expression and cell proliferation assay results. Therefore, mutant H2A/K lncRNAs may be a new factor in renal carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mechanism, needed for proper control over the expression of genetic information and silencing of repetitive elements. Exposure to ionizing radiation, aside from its strong genotoxic potential, may also affect the methylation of DNA, within the repetitive elements, in particular. In this study, we exposed C57BL/6J male mice to low absorbed mean doses of two types of space radiation\u2014proton (0.1\u00a0Gy, 150\u00a0MeV, dose rate 0.53\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08\u00a0Gy/min), and heavy iron ions (56Fe) (0.5\u00a0Gy, 600\u00a0MeV/n, dose rate 0.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06\u00a0Gy/min). Radiation-induced changes in cardiac DNA methylation associated with repetitive elements were detected. Specifically, modest hypomethylation of retrotransposon LINE-1 was observed at day 7 after irradiation with either protons or 56Fe. This was followed by LINE-1, and other retrotransposons, ERV2 and SINE B1, as well as major satellite DNA hypermethylation at day 90 after irradiation with 56Fe. These changes in DNA methylation were accompanied by alterations in the expression of DNA methylation machinery and affected the one-carbon metabolism pathway. Furthermore, loss of transposable elements expression was detected in the cardiac tissue at the 90-day time-point, paralleled by substantial accumulation of mRNA transcripts, associated with major satellites. Given that the one-carbon metabolism pathway can be modulated by dietary modifications, these findings suggest a potential strategy for the mitigation and, possibly, prevention of the negative effects exerted by ionizing radiation on the cardiovascular system. Additionally, we show that the methylation status and expression of repetitive elements may serve as early biomarkers of exposure to space radiation.",

Therefore, we systematically screened 23 potentially functional polymorphisms in MSC genes and evaluated the association between the genetic variants and DNA damage levels in 307 subjects from three cities in southern, central and northern China (Zhuhai, Wuhan and Tianjin, respectively).

     "abstract": "The NPM1 gene encodes nucleophosmin, a protein involved in multiple cell functions and carcinogenesis. Mutation of the NPM1 gene, causing delocalization of the protein, is the most frequent genetic lesion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML); it is considered a founder event in AML pathogenesis and serves as a favorable prognostic marker. Moreover, in solid tumors and some leukemia cell lines, overexpression of the NPM1 gene is commonly observed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a new method for the detection of NPM1 mutations and the simultaneous analysis of copy number alterations (CNAs), which may underlie NPM1 gene expression deregulation. To address both of the issues, we applied a strategy based on multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). A designed NPM1mut+ assay enables the detection of three of the most frequent NPM1 mutations: A, B and D. The accuracy of the assay was tested using a group of 83 samples from Polish patients with AML and other blood-proliferative disorders. To verify the results, we employed traditional Sanger sequencing and next-generation transcriptome sequencing. With the use of the NPM1mut+ assay, we detected mutations A, D and B in 14, 1 and 0 of the analyzed samples, respectively. All of these mutations were confirmed by complementary sequencing approaches, proving the 100% specificity and sensitivity of the proposed test. The performed sequencing analysis allowed the identification of two additional rare mutations (I and ZE). All of the mutations were identified exclusively in AML cases, accounting for 25% of those cases. We did not observe any CNAs (amplifications) of the NPM1 gene in the studied samples, either with or without the mutation. The presented method is simple, reliable and cost-effective. It can be easily introduced into clinical practice or developed to target both less-frequent mutations in the NPM1 gene and other cancer-related genes.",

A higher incidence of mutations, in the C1 and C2 domains in inhibitor positive patients, and in the A1 domain in inhibitor negative patients was observed, though not significantly different.

     "abstract": "Aldehydes are genotoxic and cytotoxic molecules and have received considerable attention for their associations with the pathogenesis of various human diseases. In addition, exposure to anthropogenic aldehydes increases human health risks. The general mechanism of aldehyde toxicity involves adduct formation with biomolecules such as DNA and proteins. Although the genotoxic effects of aldehydes such as mutations and chromosomal aberrations are directly related to DNA damage, the role of DNA damage in the cytotoxic effects of aldehydes is poorly understood because concurrent protein damage by aldehydes has similar effects. In this study, we have analysed how saturated and \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes exert cytotoxic effects through DNA and protein damage. Interestingly, DNA repair is essential for alleviating the cytotoxic effect of weakly toxic aldehydes such as saturated aldehydes but not highly toxic aldehydes such as long \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes. Thus, highly toxic aldehydes inactivate cells exclusively by protein damage. Our data suggest that DNA interstrand crosslinks, but not DNA-protein crosslinks and DNA double-strand breaks, are the critical cytotoxic DNA damage induced by aldehydes. Further, we show that the depletion of intracellular glutathione and the oxidation of thioredoxin 1 partially account for the DNA damage-independent cytotoxicity of aldehydes. On the basis of these findings, we have proposed a mechanistic model of aldehyde cytotoxicity mediated by DNA and protein damage.",

In 85% of RCs, double minutes, observed in a large number of human tumors, were present. Results of CA analysis suggested that radon and its decay products (alpha-emitters) were the leading factors causing RC in subjects exposed to high LET radiation.

     "abstract": "Auranofin, a thioredoxin reductase inhibitor and an anti-rheumatic drug is currently undergoing phase 2 clinical studies for repurposing to treat recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. Previous studies have established that auranofin exerts its cytotoxic activity by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1) is a DNA repair protein whose functional status is critical in the prognosis of ovarian cancer. Apart from its key role in DNA repair, BRCA1 is also known to modulate cellular redox homeostasis by regulating the stability of anti-oxidant transcription factor, nuclear factor erythroid 2\u2014related factor 2 (Nrf2) via direct protein\u2013protein interaction. However, it is currently unknown whether BRCA1 modulates the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to auranofin. Here we report that BRCA1-depleted cells exhibited increased DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and decreased clonogenic cell survival upon auranofin treatment. Interestingly, auranofin induced the expression of Nrf2 in BRCA1-depleted cells suggesting its regulation independent of BRCA1. Furthermore, anti-oxidant agent, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) protected BRCA1-depleted cells from DNA damage and apoptosis induced by auranofin. Our study suggests that accumulated lethal DSBs resulting from the oxidative damage render BRCA1 deficient cells more sensitive to auranofin despite the activation of Nrf2.",

In particular, there is an increased dCTP pool, often accompanied by a decreased dTTP pool. In the work presented here, we show that double mutants of Escherichia coli lacking both DCD and NDK (nucleoside diphosphate kinase) have even more extreme imbalances of dNTPs than mutants lacking only one or the other of these enzymes. In particular, the dCTP pool rises to very high levels, exceeding even the cellular ATP level by several-fold. This increased level of dCTP, coupled with more modest changes in other dNTPs, results in exceptionally high mutation levels. The high mutation levels are attenuated by the addition of thymidine. The results corroborate the critical importance of controlling DNA precursor levels for promoting genome stability. We also show that the addition of certain exogenous nucleosides can influence replication errors in DCD-proficient strains that are deficient in mismatch repair.",

Recent evidence has shown that NER aids in removing oxidized DNA damage and may interact with base excision repair (BER) enzymes. Here, we investigated APE1 and OGG1 expression, localization and activity after oxidative stress in XPC-deficient cells. The endogenous APE1 and OGG1 mRNA levels were lower in XPC-deficient fibroblasts. However, XPC-deficient cells did not show hypersensitivity to oxidative stress compared with NER-proficient cells. To confirm the impact of an XPC deficiency in regulating APE1 and OGG1 expression and activity, we established an XPC-complemented cell line. Although the XPC complementation was only partial and transient, the transfected cells exhibited greater OGG1 expression and activity compared with XPC-deficient cells. However, the APE1 expression and activity did not significantly change. Furthermore, we observed a physical interaction between the XPC and APE1 proteins. Together, the results indicate that the responses of XPC-deficient cells under oxidative stress may not only be associated with NER deficiency per se but may also include new XPC functions in regulating BER proteins.",

     "abstract": "The majority of protein coding genes in vertebrates contain several introns that are removed by the mRNA splicing machinery. Errors during splicing can generate aberrant transcripts and degrade the transmission of genetic information thus contributing to genomic instability and disease. However, estimating the error rate of constitutive splicing is complicated by the process of alternative splicing which can generate multiple alternative transcripts per locus and is particularly active in humans. In order to estimate the error frequency of constitutive mRNA splicing and avoid bias by alternative splicing we have characterized the frequency of splice variants at three loci, HPRT, POLB, and TRPV1 in multiple tissues of six vertebrate species. Our analysis revealed that the frequency of splice variants varied widely among loci, tissues, and species. However, the lowest observed frequency is quite constant among loci and approximately 0.1% aberrant transcripts per intron. Arguably this reflects the \u201cirreducible\u201d error rate of splicing, which consists primarily of the combination of replication errors by RNA polymerase II in splice consensus sequences and spliceosome errors in correctly pairing exons.",

It was found that the cell co-culture amplified the detrimental effects of \u03b1-irradiation including cell viability decrease and apoptosis promotion on both irradiated cells and bystander cells in a feedback loop which was closely relevant to the activation of MAPK and NF-\u03baB pathways in the bystander U937 cells.

Polymorphisms in these genes have been implicated in colorectal cancer etiology; however, epigenetic modifications such as gene-specific DNA methylation also affect gene expression.DNA methylation of DNMT3B and MTHFR was quantified in blood leukocytes using Sequenom EpiTYPER\u00ae among 272 participants undergoing a screening colonoscopy. DNA methylation was quantified in 66 and 28CpG sites of DNMT3B and MTHFR respectively, and conceptualized using two approaches. First, measures representing average methylation across all CpG sites were created. Second, unsupervised principal component (PC) analysis was used to identify summary variables representing methylation around the transcription start site and in the gene-coding area for both DNMT3B and MTHFR. Logistic regression was used to compare methylation levels between participants diagnosed with colorectal adenoma(s) versus those with a normal colonoscopy via the estimation of odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the risk of colorectal adenomas.No association was observed between average DNA methylation of either DNMT3B or MTHFR and colorectal adenoma risk. For DNMT3B, increasing DNA methylation of CpG sites in the gene-coding area was associated with a higher risk of colorectal adenomas (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.34; 95% CI: 1.01\u20131.79 per SD).This research provides preliminary evidence that methylation of DNMT3B may have functional significance with respect to colorectal adenomas, precursors to the vast majority of colorectal cancers.",

In addition, we also investigated the diagnostic ability of urinary 8-OHdG in the identification of microvascular complications in T2DM.A case-control study, enrolling 22 healthy controls and 54 subjects with T2DM, was performed to evaluate the relation between oxidative DNA damage and interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1,tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-10, and Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) index. T2DM patients presented higher urinary 8-OHdG, IL-6, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1 levels and HOMA-IR, and lower IL-10 levels than control subjects. Moreover, urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in the group T2DM with microvascular complications when compared to the without complications.

Our findings showed that T2DM patients with higher urinary 8-OHdG levels showed a greater inflammatory degree and higher insulin resistance.

We show that XP-A human primary fibroblasts present increased levels and different types of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) as compared to normal fibroblasts, with O2\u2212 and H2O2 being the major reactive species. Moreover, XP-A cells are characterized by decreased reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratios as compared to normal fibroblasts. The significant increase of ROS levels and the alteration of the glutathione redox state following silencing of XPA confirmed the causal relationship between a functional XPA and the control of redox balance. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) analysis of the metabolic profile revealed a more glycolytic metabolism and higher ATP levels in XP-A than in normal primary fibroblasts.

The conference was co-chaired by Charles L. Sawyers form Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, Elaine R. Mardis form Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Arul M. Chinnaiyan from University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.About 500 clinicians, basic science investigators, bioinformaticians, and postdoctoral fellows joined together to discuss the current state of Clinical Genomics and the advances and challenges of integrating Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies into clinical practice. The plenary sessions and panel discussions covered current platforms and sequencing approaches adopted for NGS assays of cancer genome at several national and international institutions, different approaches used to map and classify targetable sequence variants, and how information acquired with the sequencing of the cancer genome is used to guide treatment options. While challenges still exist from a technological perspective, it emerged that there exists considerable need for the development of tools to aid the identification of the therapy most suitable based on the mutational profile of the somatic cancer genome. The process to match patients to ongoing clinical trials is still complex. In addition, the need for centralized data repositories, preferably linked to well annotated clinical records, that aid sharing of sequencing information is central to begin understanding the contribution of variants of unknown significance to tumor etiology and response to therapy. Here we summarize the highlights of this stimulating four-day conference with a major emphasis on the open problems that the clinical genomics community is currently facing and the tools most needed for advancing this field.",

     "abstract": "Adverse soft tissue reactions in patients with metal-on-metal (MoM) hip replacement are associated with cobalt (Co) and chromium (Cr) particles released from the implant. Exposing the patients to long periods of increased metal ions concentrations resulting from the wear of these implants poses an increased risk of genotoxicity/mutagenicity. A variable proportion of patients develop periprosthetic soft-tissue masses or pseudotumors at the site of the implant. There is a concern that exposure to increased metal ions could increase the risk of cancer. In order to investigate whether the periprosthetic soft-tissue mass harbours any cancer- related genetic alterations, we studied DNA isolated from periprosthetic tissues of 20 patients with MoM hip replacement, for copy number alterations and mutations in hotspot regions of 50 cancer genes using aCGH and amplicon-based next generation sequencing.Our results showed copy number gains at 12q14.3 and 21q21.1in tumour from patient diagnosed with liposarcoma. Copy number alterations in periprosthetic tissues were seen in three other patients, one had a region of gain at 9q24.1 affecting JAK2 and INSL6, and two patients had region of gain at 6p21.1, affecting RUNX2. Mutation analysis showed V1578del mutation in NOTCH1 in two patients. The copy number alterations and mutations seen in periprosthetic soft-tissue masses are earlier reported in either haematological malignancies or in osteoblast related bone dysplasia. The presence of genetic anomalies was associated with longer in-situ time of the implant. Our findings warrant the need of similar studies in larger patient cohorts to evaluate the risk of development of neoplastic alterations in periprosthetic tissues of patients with MoM hip replacement.",

     "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is a member of the Repeat Expansion Diseases, a group of genetic conditions resulting from an increase/expansion in the size of a specific tandem array. FRDA results from expansion of a GAA/TTC-tract in the first intron of the frataxin gene (FXN). The disease-associated tandem repeats all form secondary structures that are thought to contribute to the propensity of the repeat to expand. The subset of these diseases that result from a CGG/CCG-repeat expansion, such as Fragile X syndrome, also express a folate-sensitive fragile site coincident with the repeat on the affected chromosome. This chromosome fragility involves the generation of chromosome/chromatid gaps or breaks, or the high frequency loss of one or both copies of the affected gene when cells are grown under folate stress or as we showed previously, in the presence of an inhibitor of the ATM checkpoint kinase. Whether Repeat Expansion Disease loci containing different repeats form similar fragile sites was not known. We show here that the region of chromosome 9 that contains the FXN locus is intrinsically prone to breakage in vivo even in control cells. However, like FXS alleles, FRDA alleles show significantly elevated levels of chromosome abnormalities in the presence of an ATM inhibitor, consistent with the formation of a fragile site.",

     "abstract": "Although myeloid leukemia (ML) is one of the major health concerns from exposure to space radiation, the risk prediction for developing ML is unsatisfactory. To increase the reliability of predicting ML risk, a much improved understanding of space radiation-induced changes in the target cells, i.e. hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), is important. We focused on the in vivo induction of late-occurring damage in HSPCs of mice exposed to 28Si ions since such damage is associated with radiation-induced genomic instability (a key event of carcinogenesis). We gave adult male CBA/CaJ mice, known to be sensitive to radiation-induced ML, a whole-body exposure (2 fractionated exposures, 15 days apart, that totaled each selected dose, delivered at the dose-rate of 1\u00a0cGy/min) to various doses of 300\u00a0MeV/n 28Si ions, i.e. 0 (sham controls), 0.1, 0.25, or 0.5\u00a0Gy. At 6 months post-irradiation, we collected bone marrow cells from each mouse (five mice per treatment-group) for obtaining the myeloid-lineage of HSPC-derived clones for analyses. We measured the frequencies of late-occurring chromosome aberrations (CAs), using the genome-wide multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization method. The measurement of CAs was coupled with the characterization of the global DNA methylation patterns, i.e. 5-methylcytosine (5mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). A dose-dependent increase in the frequencies of CAs was detected (Analysis of Variance or ANOVA, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), indicating the induction of genomic instability after exposure of mice to 300\u00a0MeV/n 28Si ions. Slight increases in the levels of 5mC were observed in all treatment groups, as compared to the sham-control level. In contrast, there was a significant reduction in levels of 5hmC (ANOVA, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Since these endpoints were evaluated in the same mouse, our data suggested for the first time a link between a reduction in 5hmC and genomic instability in HSPC-derived myeloid colonies of CBA/CaJ mice exposed to 300\u00a0MeV/n 28Si ions.",

In addition to its extended spectrum of substrates, TDP1 interacts with several DNA damage response factors. To determine whether TDP1 participates in the repair of topoisomerase II (Top2) induced DNA lesions, we generated TDP1 depleted (TDP1kd) human tumoral cells. We found that TDP1kd cells are hypersensitive to etoposide (ETO). Moreover, we established in a chromatin context that following treatment with ETO, TDP1kd cells accumulate increased amounts of Top2\u03b1 cleavage complexes, removing them with an altered kinetics. We also showed that TDP1 depleted cells accumulate increased \u03b3H2AX and pS296Chk1 signals following treatment with ETO. Similarly, cytogenetics analyses following Top2 poisoning revealed increased amounts of chromatid and chromosome breaks and exchanges on TDP1kd cells in the presence or not of the DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7026. However, the levels of sister chromatid exchanges were similar in both TDP1kd and control non-silenced cell lines. This suggests a role of TDP1 in both canonical non-homologous end joining and alternative end joining, but not in the homologous recombination repair pathway. Finally, micronucleus analyses following ETO treatment revealed a higher frequency of micronucleus containing \u03b3H2AX signals on TDP1kd cells. Together, our results highlight an active role of TDP1 in the repair of Top2-induced DNA damage and its relevance on the genome stability maintenance in human cells.",

     "abstract": "The article describes substitutions in bacteriophage T4 RNase H which provide so called das-effect. Phage T4 DNA arrest suppression (das) mutations have been described to be capable of partially suppressing the phage DNA arrest phenotype caused by a dysfunction in genes 46 and/or 47 (also known as Mre11/Rad50 complex). Genetic mapping of das13 (one of the das mutations) has shown it to be in the region of the rnh gene encoding RNase H. Here we report that Das13 mutant of RNase H has substitutions of valine 43 and leucine 242 with isoleucines. To investigate the influence of these mutations on RNase H nuclease properties we have designed a novel in vitro assay that allows us to separate and quantify exo- or endonuclease activities of flap endonuclease. The nuclease assay in vitro showed that V43I substitution increased the ratio between exonuclease/endonuclease activities of RNase H whereas L242I substitution did not affect the nuclease activity of RNase H in vitro. However, both mutations were necessary for the full das effect in vivo. Molecular modelling of the nuclease structure suggests that V43I substitution may lead to disposition of H4 helix, responsible for the interaction with the first base pairs of 5\u2032end of branched DNA. These structural changes may affect unwinding of the first base pairs of gapped or nicked DNA generating a short flap and therefore may stabilize the DNA-enzyme complex. L242I substitution did not affect the structure of RNase H and its role in providing das-effect remains unclear.",

To investigate the genetic basis of NS-ID we analyzed 43 trios and 22 isolated NS-ID patients using a targeted sequencing (TS) approach. 71 NS-ID genes have been selected and sequenced in all subjects. We found putative pathogenic mutations in 7 out of 65 patients. The pathogenic role of mutations was evaluated through sequence comparison and structural analysis was performed to predict the effect of alterations in a 3D computational model through molecular dynamics simulations. Additionally, a deep patient clinical re-evaluation has been performed after the molecular results. This approach allowed us to find novel pathogenic mutations with a detection rate close to 11% in our cohort of patients. This result supports the hypothesis that many NS-ID related genes still remain to be discovered and that NS-ID is a more complex phenotype compared to syndromic form, likely caused by a complex and broad interaction between genes alterations and environment factors.",

     "abstract": "Y-family DNA polymerases are important for conferring cellular resistance to DNA damaging agents in part due to their specialized ability to copy damaged DNA. The Escherichia coli Y-family DNA polymerases are encoded by the umuDC and dinB genes. UmuC and the cleaved form of UmuD, UmuD\u2032, form UmuD\u20322C (pol V), which is able to bypass UV photoproducts such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 thymine\u2013thymine dimers, whereas DinB is specialized to copy N2-dG adducts, such as N2-furfuryl-dG. To better understand this inherent specificity, we used hydroxylamine to generate a random library of UmuC variants from which we then selected those with the ability to confer survival to nitrofurazone (NFZ), which is believed to cause N2-furfuryl-dG lesions. We tested the ability of three of the selected UmuC variants, A9V, H282P, and T412I, to bypass N2-furfuryl-dG in vitro, and discovered that pol V containing UmuC A9V has overall modestly better primer extension activity than WT pol V, whereas the UmuC T412I and UmuC H282P mutations result in much lower primer extension efficiency. Upon further characterization, we found that the ability of the UmuC variant A9V to render cells UV-mutable is dependent on the proper length of the arm of UmuD\u2032. Cells harboring UmuC variants T412I and H282P show enhanced cleavage of UmuD to form UmuD\u2032, which, together with our other observations, suggests that this may be due to a disruption of a direct interaction between UmuC and UmuD. Thus, we find that protein interactions as well as protein conformation appear to be crucial for resistance to specific types of DNA damage.",

DDR with checkpoint activation was indicated by histone H2AX and Chk2 protein phosphorylation, and by increased p53 protein levels. In addition, both fetal and adult DS fibroblasts were more sensitive to oxidative DNA damage induced by potassium bromate, and were defective in the removal of 8-oxodG, as compared with age-matched cells from control healthy donors. The analysis of core proteins participating in base excision repair (BER), such as XRCC1 and DNA polymerase \u03b2, showed that higher amounts of these factors were bound to chromatin in DS than in control cells, even in the absence of DNA damage. These findings occurred in concomitance with increased levels of phosphorylated XRCC1 detected in DS cells.

We compiled a set of 222 features and selected a set of 21 properties utilizing feature selection methods, for maximizing the prediction performance. In a set of 540 mutants, we obtained an overall classification accuracy of 67.8% with 10 fold cross validation using support vector machines. Further, the mutations have been grouped into four sets based on secondary structure and accessible surface area, which enhanced the overall classification accuracy to 80.2%, 81.9%, 77.9% and 75.1% for helix, strand, coil-buried and coil-exposed mutants, respectively. The method was tested with a blind dataset of 60 mutations, which showed an average accuracy of 85.4%. These accuracy levels are superior to other methods available in the literature for EGFR mutants, with an increase of more than 30%.

The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between frailty status and micronucleus (MN) frequency, a known marker of genomic instability, in a sample of elder adults. Several clinical features were evaluated and their possible association with MN frequency was tested. Criteria proposed by Fried were used to identify frail subjects. Overall, 180 elder adults entered the study, 93 of them (51.7%) frail. No association between MN frequency and frailty status was found under the specific conditions tested in this study (mean ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.06; 95% CI 0.96\u20131.18).

Adaptive response could hypothetically reduce the risk of late adverse effects of chronic or acute radiation exposures in humans. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of such responses is of relevance for radiation protection as well as for the clinical applications of radiation in medicine. However, due to the variability of responses depending on the model system and radiation condition, there is a need to further study under what conditions adaptive response can be induced. In this study, we analyzed if there is a dose rate dependence for the adapting dose, assuming that the adapting dose induces DNA response/repair pathways that are dose rate dependent. MCF-10A cells were exposed to a 50\u00a0mGy adapting dose administered acutely (0.40\u00a0Gy/min) or chronically (1.4\u00a0mGy/h or 4.1\u00a0mGy/h) and then irradiated by high acute challenging doses.

The highest concentrations of air pollutants were detected in winter 2010 when the subjects were exposed to: PM of aerodynamic diameter <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM2.5) (70 vs. 44.9\u00a0\u03bcg/m3); benzo[a]pyrene (9.02 vs. 2.56\u00a0ng/m3) and benzene (10.2 vs. 5.5\u00a0\u03bcg/m3) in Ostrava and Prague, respectively. Global gene expression analysis of total RNA extracted from leukocytes was performed using Illumina Expression BeadChips microarrays. The expression of selected genes was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Gene expression profiles differed by locations and seasons. Despite lower concentrations of air pollutants a higher number of differentially expressed genes and affected KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways was found in subjects from Prague. In both locations immune response pathways were affected, in Prague also neurodegenerative diseases-related pathways. Over-representation of the latter pathways was associated with the exposure to PM2.5. The qRT-PCR analysis showed a significant decrease in expression of APEX, ATM, FAS, GSTM1, IL1B and RAD21 in subjects from Ostrava, in a comparison of winter 2010 and summer 2009. In Prague, an increase in gene expression was observed for GADD45A and PTGS2. In conclusion, high concentrations of pollutants in Ostrava were not associated with higher number of differentially expressed genes, affected KEGG pathways and expression levels of selected genes. This observation suggests that chronic exposure to air pollution may result in reduced gene expression response with possible negative health consequences.",

     "abstract": "Radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) is well accepted in the radiation research field by now, but the underlying molecular mechanisms for better understanding this phenomenon caused by intercellular communication and intracellular signal transduction are still incomplete. Although our previous study has demonstrated an important role of miR-21 of unirradiated bystander cells in RIBEs, the direct evidence for the hypothesis that RIBE is epigenetically regulated is still limited and how miR-21 mediates RIBEs is unknown. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been demonstrated to be involved in RIBEs, however, the roles of anti-oxidative stress system of cells in RIBEs are unclear. Using transwell insert co-culture system, we investigated medium-mediated bystander responses in WS1 human fibroblasts after co-culture with HaCaT keratinocytes traversed by \u03b1-particles. Results showed that the ROS levels in unirradiated bystander WS1 cells were significantly elevated after 30\u00a0min of co-culture, and 53BP1 foci, a surrogate marker of DNA damage, were obviously induced after 3\u00a0h of co-culture. This indicates the occurrence of oxidative stress and DNA damage in bystander WS1 cells after co-culture with irradiated keratinocytes. Furthermore, the expression of miR-21 was increased in bystander WS1 cells, downregulation of miR-21 eliminated the bystander responses, overexpression of miR-21 alone could induce bystander-like oxidative stress and DNA damage in WS1 cells. These data indicate an important mediating role of miR-21 in RIBEs. In addition, MnSOD or SOD2 in WS1 cells was involved in the bystander effects, overexpression of SOD2 abolished the bystander oxidative stress and DNA damage, indicating that SOD2 was critical to the induction of RIBEs. Moreover, we found that miR-21 regulated SOD2, suggesting that miR-21 might mediate bystander responses through its regulation on SOD2. In conclusion, this study revealed a profound role of miR-21-regulated SOD2 of unirradiated WS1 cells in bystander effects induced by \u03b1-irradiated HaCaT keratinocytes.",

     "abstract": "DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is of considerable importance for genomic integrity. Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are considered as two major mechanistically distinct pathways involved in repairing DSBs. In recent years, another DSB repair pathway, namely, microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ), has received increasing attention. MMEJ is generally believed to utilize an alternative mechanism to repair DSBs when NHEJ and other mechanisms fail. In this study, we utilized zebrafish as an in vivo model to study DSB repair and demonstrated that efficient MMEJ repair occurred in the zebrafish genome when DSBs were induced using TALEN (transcription activator-like effector nuclease) or CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas9 technologies. The wide existence of MMEJ repair events in zebrafish embryos was further demonstrated via the injection of several in vitro-designed exogenous MMEJ reporters. Interestingly, the inhibition of endogenous ligase 4 activity significantly increased MMEJ frequency, and the inhibition of ligase 3 activity severely decreased MMEJ activity. These results suggest that MMEJ in zebrafish is dependent on ligase 3 but independent of ligase 4. This study will enhance our understanding of the mechanisms of MMEJ in vivo and facilitate inducing desirable mutations via DSB-induced repair.",

Despite the miscoding nature of most common DNA lesions, several of them are bypassed in mammalian cells in a relatively accurate manner, which plays a key role maintaining a low mutation load. Whereas it is generally agreed that TLS across the major UV and sunlight induced DNA lesion, the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD), is accurate, there were conflicting reports on whether the same is true for the thymine\u2013thymine pyrimidine\u2013pyrimidone(6-4) ultraviolet light photoproduct (TT6-4PP), which represents the second most common class of UV lesions. Using a TLS assay system based on gapped plasmids carrying site-specific TT6-4PP lesions in defined sequence contexts we show that the DNA sequence context markedly affected both the extent and accuracy of TLS. The sequence exhibiting higher TLS exhibited also higher error-frequency, caused primarily by semi-targeted mutations, at the nearest nucleotides flanking the lesion. Our results resolve the discrepancy reported on TLS across TT6-4PP, and suggest that TLS is more accurate in human cells than in mouse cells.",

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by DNA cloning is a routine method, especially to examine heteroplasmy of mtDNA mutations. In this review, we compare the mtDNA mutation patterns detected by three different sequencing strategies. Cloning and sequencing methods that are based on PCR amplification of DNA extracted from either single cells or pooled cells yield a high frequency of mutations, partly due to the artifacts introduced by PCR and/or the DNA cloning process. Direct sequencing of PCR product which has been amplified from DNA in individual cells is able to detect the low levels of mtDNA mutations present within a cell. We further summarize the findings in our recent studies that utilized this single cell method to assay mtDNA mutation patterns in different human blood cells. Our data show that many somatic mutations observed in the end-stage differentiated cells are found in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitors within the CD34+ cell compartment. Accumulation of mtDNA variations in the individual CD34+ cells is affected by both aging and family genetic background. Granulocytes harbor higher numbers of mutations compared with the other cells, such as CD34+ cells and lymphocytes. Serial assessment of mtDNA mutations in a population of single CD34+ cells obtained from the same donor over time suggests stability of some somatic mutations. CD34+ cell clones from a donor marked by specific mtDNA somatic mutations can be found in the recipient after transplantation. The significance of these findings is discussed in terms of the lineage tracing of HSCs, aging effect on accumulation of mtDNA mutations and the usage of mtDNA sequence in forensic identification.",

As the controls (references), blood samples of people, who had never been occupationally subjected to the IR sources, were used (N\u00a0=\u00a0109).

The depletion of BAF180, a unique subunit of the PBAF chromatin remodeling complex in human cells results in reduced PCNA ubiquitination leading to less efficient fork progression following DNA damage, but little is known about the mechanism. Here, we report that the expression of exogenous BAF180 in cells promotes PCNA ubiquitination during S-phase after UV irradiation and it persists for many hours. No correlation was observed between the protein level of ubiquitin-specific protease 1 (USP1) and ubiquitinated PCNA in BAF180 expressing cells. Analysis of cells expressing BAF180 deletion mutants showed that the bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domains are responsible for this effect. Surprisingly, a deletion construct encoding only the BAH domain region is able to increase the level of ubiquitinated PCNA, even though it is unable to be assembled into the PBAF complex. These results suggest that the ATPase-dependent chromatin remodeling activity of PBAF is not necessary, but instead the BAH domains are sufficient to promote PCNA ubiquitination.",

The high GC content of mycobacterial genomes predisposes these organisms to oxidative damage of guanine. The exposure of cellular DNA to OH and one-electron oxidants results in the formation of two main degradation products, the pro-mutagenic 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) and the cytotoxic 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyGua). These lesions are repaired through the base excision repair (BER) pathway and we previously, demonstrated a combinatorial role for the mycobacterial Endonuclease III (Nth) and the Nei family of DNA glycosylases in mutagenesis. In addition, the formamidopyrimidine (Fpg/MutM) and MutY DNA glycosylases have also been implicated in mutation avoidance and BER in mycobacteria. In this study, we further investigate the combined role of MutY and the Fpg/Nei DNA glycosylases in Mycobacterium smegmatis and demonstrate that deletion of mutY resulted in enhanced sensitivity to oxidative stress, an effect which was not exacerbated in \u0394fpg1 \u0394fpg2 or \u0394nei1 \u0394nei2 double mutant backgrounds. However, combinatorial loss of the mutY, fpg1 and fpg2 genes resulted in a significant increase in mutation rates suggesting interplay between these enzymes. Consistent with this, there was a significant increase in C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0A mutations with a corresponding change in cell morphology of rifampicin resistant mutants in the \u0394fpg1 \u0394fpg2 \u0394mutY deletion mutant. In contrast, deletion of mutY together with the nei homologues did not result in any growth/survival defects or changes in mutation rates.

     "abstract": "Nrf2 is a redox sensitive transcription factor that is involved in the co-ordinated transcription of genes involved in redox homeostasis. But the role of Nrf2 in DNA repair is not investigated in detail. We have employed A549 and MCF7 cells to study the role of Nrf2 on DNA repair by inhibiting Nrf2 using all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or by knock down approach prior to radiation exposure (4\u00a0Gy). DNA damage and repair analysis was studied by \u03b3H2AX foci formation and comet assay. Results suggested that the inhibition of Nrf2 in A549 or MCF7 cells led to significant slowdown in DNA repair as compared to respective radiation controls. The persistence of residual DNA damage even in the presence of free radical scavenger N-acetyl cysteine, suggested that the influence of Nrf2 on DNA repair was not linked to its antioxidant functions. Further, its influence on non-homologous end joining repair pathway was studied by inhibiting both Nrf2 and DNA-PK together. This led to synergistic reduction of survival fraction, indicating that Nrf2 may not be influencing the NHEJ pathway. To investigate the role of homologous recombination repair (HR) pathway, RAD51 foci formation was monitored. There was a significant reduction in the foci formation in cells treated with ATRA or shRNA against Nrf2 as compared to their respective radiation controls. Further, Nrf2 inhibition led to significant reduction in mRNA levels of RAD51. BLAST analysis was also performed on upstream regions of DNA repair genes to identify antioxidant response element and found that many repair genes that are involved in HR pathway may be regulated by Nrf2. Together, these results suggest the involvement of Nrf2 in DNA repair, a hitherto unknown function of Nrf2, putatively through its influence on HR pathway.",

     "abstract": "Apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites are some of the most frequent DNA damages and the key intermediates of base excision repair. Certain proteins can interact with the deoxyribose of the AP site to form a Schiff base, which can be stabilized by NaBH4 treatment. Several types of DNA containing the AP site were used to trap proteins in human cell extracts by this method. In the case of single-stranded AP DNA and AP DNA duplex with both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 dangling ends, the major crosslinking product had an apparent molecular mass of 45\u00a0kDa. Using peptide mass mapping based on mass spectrometry data, we identified the protein forming this adduct as an isoform of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) called \u201curacil-DNA glycosylase\u201d. GAPDH is a glycolytic enzyme with many additional putative functions, which include interaction with nucleic acids, different DNA damages and DNA repair enzymes. We investigated interaction of GAPDH purified from HeLa cells and rabbit muscles with different AP DNAs. In spite of the ability to form a Schiff-base intermediate with the deoxyribose of the AP site, GAPDH does not display the AP lyase activity. In addition, along with the borohydride-dependent adducts with AP DNAs containing single-stranded regions, GAPDH was also shown to form the stable borohydride-independent crosslinks with these AP DNAs. GAPDH was proven to crosslink preferentially to AP DNAs cleaved via the \u03b2-elimination mechanism (spontaneously or by AP lyases) as compared to DNAs containing the intact AP site. The level of GAPDH\u2013AP DNA adduct formation depends on oxidation of the protein SH-groups; disulfide bond reduction in GAPDH leads to the loss of its ability to form the adducts with AP DNA. A possible role of formation of the stable adducts with AP sites by GAPDH is discussed.",

Although T-cell lymphoma incidence was similar, loss of heterozygosity at Cdkn2a on chromosome 4 and at Ikaros on chromosome 11 was more frequent in the two older groups, while loss at the Pten locus on chromosome 19 was more frequent in the infant-irradiated group. Cdkn2a and Ikaros mutation/loss was a common feature of the young adult-irradiation group, with Ikaros frequently (50%) incurring multiple independent hits (including deletions and mutations) or suffering a single hit predicted to result in a dominant negative protein (such as those lacking exon 4, an isoform we have designated Ik12, which lacks two DNA binding zinc-finger domains). Conversely, Pten mutations were more frequent after early irradiation (60%) than after young adult-irradiation (30%). Homozygous Pten mutations occurred without DNA copy number change after irradiation starting in infancy, suggesting duplication of the mutated allele by chromosome mis-segregation or mitotic recombination. Our findings demonstrate that while deletions on chromosomes 4 and 11 affecting Cdkn2a and Ikaros are a prominent feature of young adult irradiation-induced T-cell lymphoma, tumors arising after irradiation from infancy suffer a second hit in Pten by mis-segregation or recombination. This is the first report showing an influence of age-at-exposure on genomic alterations of tumor suppressor genes and their relative involvement in radiation-induced T-cell lymphoma.

Here, we investigate the role of non-cytotoxic levels of environmental factors, benzene, and diethylnitrosamine (DEN), and chemotherapeutic agents, etoposide, and doxorubicin, in generating DNA breakage at the patient breakpoint hotspots of the MLL and CBFB genes in human HSPCs. These conditions represent exposure to chemicals encountered daily or residual doses from chemotherapeutic drugs. Exposure of HSPCs to non-cytotoxic levels of environmental chemicals or chemotherapeutic agents causes DNA breakage at preferential sites in the human genome, including the leukemia-related genes MLL and CBFB. Though benzene, etoposide, and doxorubicin have previously been linked to leukemia formation, this is the first study to demonstrate a role for DEN in the generation of DNA breakage at leukemia-specific sites. These chemical-induced DNA breakpoints coincide with sites of predicted topoisomerase II cleavage. The distribution of breakpoints by exposure to non-cytotoxic levels of chemicals showed a similar pattern to fusion breakpoints in leukemia patients. Our findings demonstrate that HSPCs exposed to non-cytotoxic levels of environmental chemicals and chemotherapeutic agents are prone to topoisomerase II-mediated DNA damage at the leukemia-associated genes MLL and CBFB. These data suggest a role for long-term environmental chemical or residual chemotherapeutic drug exposure in generation of DNA breakage at sites with a propensity to form leukemia-causing gene rearrangements.",

     "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is one of the major side effects of treatment with the anticancer drug, cisplatin. One proposed mechanism for this neurotoxicity is the formation of platinum adducts in sensory neurons that could contribute to DNA damage. Although this damage is largely repaired by nuclear excision repair (NER), our previous findings suggest that augmenting the base excision repair pathway (BER) by overexpressing the repair protein APE1 protects sensory neurons from cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity. The question remains whether APE1 contributes to the ability of the NER pathway to repair platinum-damage in neuronal cells. To examine this, we manipulated APE1 expression in sensory neuronal cultures and measured Pt-removal after exposure to cisplatin. When neuronal cultures were treated with increasing concentrations of cisplatin for two or three hours, there was a concentration-dependent increase in Pt-damage that peaked at four hours and returned to near baseline levels after 24\u00a0h. In cultures where APE1 expression was reduced by \u223c80% using siRNA directed at APE1, there was a significant inhibition of Pt-removal over eight hours which was reversed by overexpressing APE1 using a lentiviral construct for human wtAPE1. Overexpressing a mutant APE1 (C65 APE1), which only has DNA repair activity, but not its other significant redox-signaling function, mimicked the effects of wtAPE1. Overexpressing DNA repair activity mutant APE1 (226\u00a0+\u00a0177APE1), with only redox activity was ineffective suggesting it is the DNA repair function of APE1 and not its redox-signaling, that restores the Pt-damage removal. Together, these data provide the first evidence that a critical BER enzyme, APE1, helps regulate the NER pathway in the repair of cisplatin damage in sensory neurons.",

     "abstract": "Although studies have shown that cadmium (Cd) interfered with DNA damage repair (DDR), whether Cd could affect non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair remains elusive. To further understand the effect of Cd on DDR, we used X-ray irradiation of Hela cells as an in vitro model system, along with \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 as markers for DNA damage. Results showed that X-ray significantly increased \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci in Hela cells (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), all of which are characteristic of accrued DNA damage. The number of foci declined rapidly over time (1\u20138\u00a0h postirradiation), indicating an initiation of NHEJ process. However, the disappearance of \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci was remarkably slowed by Cd pretreatment (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), suggesting that Cd reduced the efficiency of NHEJ. To further elucidate the mechanisms of Cd toxicity, several markers of NHEJ pathway including Ku70, DNA-PKcs, XRCC4 and Ligase IV were examined. Our data showed that Cd altered the phosphorylation of DNA-PKcs, and reduced the expression of both XRCC4 and Ligase IV in irradiated cells. These observations are indicative of the impairment of NHEJ-dependent DNA repair pathways. In addition, zinc (Zn) mitigated the effects of Cd on NHEJ, suggesting that the Cd-induced NHEJ alteration may partly result from the displacement of Zn or from an interference with the normal function of Zn-containing proteins by Cd. Our findings provide a new insight into the toxicity of Cd on NHEJ repair and its underlying mechanisms in human cells.",

Mice mimic the human condition by displaying an age-associated increase in spontaneous mutant frequency in spermatogenic cells. The observed increase in mutant frequency appears to be associated with a decrease in the DNA repair protein, AP endonuclease 1 (APEX1) and Apex1 heterozygous mice display an accelerated paternal age effect as young adults. In this study, we directly tested if APEX1 over-expression in cell lines and transgenic mice could prevent increases in mutagenesis. Cell lines with ectopic expression of APEX1 had increased APEX1 activity and lower spontaneous and induced mutations in the lacI reporter gene relative to the control. Spermatogenic cells obtained from mice transgenic for human APEX1 displayed increased APEX1 activity, were protected from the age-dependent increase in spontaneous germline mutagenesis, and exhibited increased apoptosis in the spermatogonial cell population. These results directly indicate that increases in APEX1 level confer protection against the murine paternal age effect, thus highlighting the role of APEX1 in preserving reproductive health with increasing age and in protection against genotoxin-induced mutagenesis in somatic cells.",

The extension beyond the abasic site was very inefficient. Compared with incorporation of dCTP opposite G, the incorporation efficiencies opposite abasic site were greatly reduced according to the order of dGTP\u00a0>\u00a0dATP\u00a0>>\u00a0dCTP and dTTP. Pol \u03b7core showed no fast burst phase for any incorporation opposite G or abasic site, suggesting that the catalytic step is not faster than the dissociation of polymerase from DNA. LC\u2013MS/MS sequence analysis of extension products showed that 53% products were dGTP misincorporation, 33% were dATP and 14% were -1 frameshift, indicating that Pol \u03b7core bypasses abasic site by a combined G-rule, A-rule and -1 frameshift deletions. Compared with full-length pol \u03b7, pol \u03b7core relatively reduced the efficiency of incorporation of dCTP opposite G, increased the efficiencies of dNTP incorporation opposite abasic site and the exclusive incorporation of dGTP opposite abasic site, but inhibited the extension beyond abasic site, and increased the priority in extension of A: abasic site relative to G: abasic site.

Our previous work demonstrated that chronic sub-toxic i-As concentrations were able to induce biologically significant levels of genotoxic and oxidative DNA damage that were strongly influenced by the Ogg1 genotype. In order to study the nature of the observed levels of damage and the observed differences between MEF Ogg1+/+ and Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 genetic backgrounds, the genotoxic and oxidative DNA repair kinetics of 18-weeks exposed MEF cells were evaluated by the comet assay. Results indicate that MEF Ogg1+/+ and Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 cells chronically exposed to i-As repair the DNA damage induced by arsenite, potassium bromide and UVC radiation less efficiently than control cells, being that observation clearly more pronounced in MEF Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 cells. Consequently, exposed cells accumulate a higher percentage of unrepaired DNA damage at the end of the repair period. As an attempt to eliminate i-As associated toxicity, chronically exposed MEF Ogg1\u2212/\u2212 cells overexpress the arsenic metabolizing enzyme As3mt. This adaptive response confers cells a significant resistance to i-As-induced cell death, but at expenses of accumulating high levels of DNA damage due to their repair impairment. Overall, the work presented here evidences that i-As chronic exposure disrupts the normal cellular repair function, and that oxidative DNA damage\u2014and Ogg1 deficiency\u2014exacerbates this phenomenon. The observed cell death resistance under a chronic scenario of genotoxic and oxidative stress may in turn contribute to the carcinogenic effects of i-As.",

Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are thought to be responsible for these mutagenic effects. However, it was also observed that the major PA present in common ragwort, jacobine, produced a negative response (with and without the addition of rat liver S9) in Salmonella test strains TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA1537. To investigate which compounds in the plant extracts were responsible for the positive outcome, the present study investigated the contents and mutagenic effects of methanol and acetone extracts prepared from dried ground S. jacobaea and Senecio inaequidens (narrow-leafed ragwort). Subsequently, a fractionation approach was set up in combination with LC-MS/MS analysis of the fractions. It was shown that the positive Ames test outcomes of S. jacobaea extracts are unlikely to be caused by PAs, but rather by the flavonoid quercetin. This study also demonstrates the importance of identifying compounds responsible for positive test results in bioassays.",

Provided with a sufficiently stable stem, such a structure can self-catalyze depurination of the loop 5\u2032G residue, leading to a potential mutation hotspot. Previously, we showed that such a hotspot exists about codon 6 of \u03b2-globin, with by far the highest incidence of mutations across the gene, including those responsible for 6 anemias (notably Sickle Cell Anemia) and \u03b2-thalassemias. In contrast, we show here that despite identical loop sequences, there is no mutational hotspot in the \u03b4- or \u025b1-globin potential self-depurination sites, which differ by only one or two base pairs in the stem region from that of the \u03b2-globin gene. These differences result in either one or two additional mismatches in the potential 7-base pair-forming stem region, thereby weakening its stability, so that either DNA cruciform extrusion from the duplex is rendered ineffective or the lifetime of the stem-loop becomes too short to permit self-catalysis to occur. Having that same loop sequence, paralogs HB-\u03b31 and HB-\u03b32 totally lack stem-forming potential. Hence the absence in \u03b4- and \u025b1-globin genes of a mutational hotspot in what must now be viewed as non-functional homologs of the self-depurination site in \u03b2-globin. Such stem-destabilizing variants appeared early among vertebrates and remained conserved among mammals and primates. Thus, this study has revealed conserved sequence determinants of self-catalytic DNA depurination associated with variability of mutation incidence among human \u03b2-globin paralogs.",

The aim of this study was to recognize the influence of this increased free iron concentration on AlkB-directed repair of alkylated DNA by analyzing survival and argE3\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Arg+ reversion induction after \u03bb\u00a0>\u00a0320\u00a0nm light irradiation and MMS-treatment in E. coli AB1157 hemH and alkB mutants. E.coli AlkB dioxygenase constitutes a direct single-protein repair system using non-hem Fe(II) and cofactors 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and oxygen (O2) to initiate oxidative dealkylation of DNA/RNA bases. We have established that the frequency of MMS-induced Arg+ revertants in AB1157 alkB+hemH\u2013/pMW1 strain was 40 and 26% reduced comparing to the alkB+hemH\u2013 and alkB+hemH+/pMW1, respectively. It is noteworthy that the effect was observed only when bacteria were irradiated with \u03bb\u00a0>\u00a0320\u00a0nm light prior MMS-treatment. This finding indicates efficient repair of alkylated DNA in photosensibilized cells in the presence of higher free iron pool and AlkB concentrations. Interestingly, a 31% decrease in the level of Arg+ reversion was observed in irradiated and MMS-treated hemH\u2013alkB\u2013 cells comparing to the hemH+alkB\u2013 strain. Also, the level of Arg+ revertants in the irradiated and MMS treated hemH\u2013 alkB\u2013 mutant was significantly lower (by 34%) in comparison to the same strain but MMS-treated only. These indicate AlkB-independent repair involving Fe ions and reactive oxygen species. According to our hypothesis it may be caused by non-enzymatic dealkylation of alkylated dNTPs in E. coli cells. In in vitro studies, the absence of AlkB protein in the presence of iron ions allowed etheno(\u03f5) dATP and \u03f5dCTP to spontaneously convert to dAMP and dCMP, respectively. Thus, hemH\u2013 intra-cellular conditions may favor Fe-dependent dealkylation of modified dNTPs.",

     "abstract": "Radiation-induced bystander effect, appearing as different biological changes in cells that are not directly exposed to ionizing radiation but are under the influence of molecular signals secreted by irradiated neighbors, have recently attracted considerable interest due to their possible implication for radiotherapy. However, various cells present diverse radiosensitivity and bystander responses that depend, inter alia, on genetic status including TP53, the gene controlling the cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis. Here we compared the ionizing radiation and bystander responses of human colorectal carcinoma HCT116 cells with wild type or knockout TP53 using a transwell co-culture system. The viability of exposed to X-rays (0\u20138\u00a0Gy) and bystander cells of both lines showed a roughly comparable decline with increasing dose. The frequency of micronuclei was also comparable at lower doses but at higher increased considerably, especially in bystander TP53-/- cells. Moreover, the TP53-/- cells showed a significantly elevated frequency of apoptosis, while TP53+/+ counterparts expressed high level of senescence. The cross-matched experiments where irradiated cells of one line were co-cultured with non-irradiated cells of opposite line show that both cell lines were also able to induce bystander effects in their counterparts, however different endpoints revealed with different strength. Potential mediators of bystander effects, IL-6 and IL-8, were also generated differently in both lines. The knockout cells secreted IL-6 at lower doses whereas wild type cells only at higher doses. Secretion of IL-8 by TP53\u2212/\u2212 control cells was many times lower than that by TP53+/+ but increased significantly after irradiation. Transcription of the NF\u03baBIA was induced in irradiated TP53+/+ mainly, but in bystanders a higher level was observed in TP53\u2212/\u2212 cells, suggesting that TP53 is required for induction of NF\u03baB pathway after irradiation but another mechanism of activation must operate in bystander cells.",

In the present study, we demonstrate G1 cell cycle phase specific reversible loss of H3S10P in response to IR-induced DNA damage is mediated by opposing activities of phosphatase, MKP1 and kinase, MSK1 of the MAP kinase pathway. We also show that the MKP1 recruits to the chromatin in response to DNA damage and correlates with the decrease of H3S10P, whereas MKP1 is released from chromatin during recovery phase of DDR. Furthermore, blocking of H3S10 dephosphorylation by MKP1 inhibition impairs DNA repair process and results in poor survival of WRL68 cells. Collectively, our data proposes a pathway regulating G1 cell cycle phase specific reversible reduction of H3S10P on IR induced DNA damage and also raises the possibility of combinatorial modulation of H3S10P with specific inhibitors to target the cancer cells in G1-phase of cell cycle.",

     "abstract": "Acrylamide is a toxin that humans are readily exposed to due to its formation in many carbohydrate rich foods cooked at high temperatures. Acrylamide is carcinogenic, neurotoxic and causes reproductive toxicity when high levels of exposure are reached in mice and rats. Acrylamide induced effects on fertility occur predominantly in males. Acrylamide exerts its reproductive toxicity via its metabolite glycidamide, a product which is only formed via the cytochrome P450 detoxifying enzyme CYP2E1. Glycidamide is highly reactive and forms adducts with DNA. Chronic low dose acrylamide exposure in mice relevant to human exposure levels results in significantly increased levels of DNA damage in terms of glycidamide adducts in spermatocytes, the specific germ cell stage where Cyp2e1 is expressed. Since cells in the later stages of spermatogenesis are unable to undergo DNA repair, and this level of acrylamide exposure causes no reduction in fertility, there is potential for this damage to persist until sperm maturation and fertilisation. Cyp2e1 is also present within epididymal cells, allowing for transiting spermatozoa to be exposed to glycidamide. This could have consequences for future generations in terms of predisposition to diseases such as cancer, with growing indications that paternal DNA damage can be propagated across multiple generations. Since glycidamide is the major contributor to DNA damage, a mechanism for preventing these effects is inhibiting the function of Cyp2e1. Resveratrol is an example of an inhibitor of Cyp2e1 which has shown success in reducing damage caused by acrylamide treatment in mice.",

The TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) protein is recruited to the death domain of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), where it interacts with TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and receptor-interacting protein (RIP) for the induction of apoptosis, necrosis, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF\u03baB), and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation.

Moreover, under conditions promoting TNF-\u03b1-induced cell death or survival in HeLa cells, this interaction was weakened or enhanced, respectively. The interaction between hMYH and hTRADD was important for signaling pathways mediated by TNF-\u03b1. Our results also suggested that the hTRADD\u2013hMYH association was involved in the nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB and formation of the TNFR1\u2013TRADD complex. Thus, this study identified a novel mechanism through which the hMYH\u2013hTRADD interaction may affect the TNF-\u03b1 signaling pathway.In HeLa cells, the hTRADD\u2013hMYH interaction functioned in both cell survival and apoptosis pathways following TNF-\u03b1 stimulation.",

Drugs that mimic the activity of death ligands, or antagonise pro-survival proteins of the Bcl-2 or IAP families have yielded encouraging results in animal experiments and early phase clinical trials. Because these agents directly engage apoptosis pathways, rather than damaging DNA to indirectly provoke tumour cell death, we reasoned that they may offer another important advantage over conventional therapies: minimisation or elimination of side effects such as second cancers that result from mutation of surviving normal cells. Disappointingly, however, we previously found that concentrations of death receptor agonists like TRAIL that would be present in vivo in clinical settings provoked DNA damage in surviving cells. In this study, we used cell line model systems to investigate the mutagenic capacity of drugs from two other classes of direct apoptosis-inducing agents: the BH3-mimetic ABT-737 and the IAP antagonists LCL161 and AT-406. Encouragingly, our data suggest that IAP antagonists possess negligible genotoxic activity. Doses of ABT-737 that were required to damage DNA stimulated Bax/Bak-independent signalling and exceeded concentrations detected in the plasma of animals treated with this drug. These findings provide hope that cancer patients treated by BH3-mimetics or IAP antagonists may avoid mutation-related illnesses that afflict some cancer survivors treated with conventional DNA-damaging anti-cancer therapies.",

Other types of DNA damage also generate DSBs through DNA replication and repair, leading to the production of \u03b3-H2AX. In the present study, we demonstrated that linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS), the most widely used and non-genotoxic anionic surfactants, could generate \u03b3-H2AX via a novel pathway. Breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells were treated with five kinds of LAS with alkyl chains ranging from 10 to 14 carbon units (C10\u2013C14LAS). The generation of DSBs and subsequent production of \u03b3-H2AX increased in a manner that depended on the number of carbon units in LAS. \u03b3-H2AX could also be generated with non-cytotoxic doses of LAS and was independent of the cell cycle, indicating the non-apoptotic and DNA replication-independent formation of DSBs. The generation of \u03b3-H2AX could be attenuated by EGTA and ZnCl2, deoxyribonuclease-1 (DNase I) inhibitors, as well as by the knockdown of DNase I. LAS weakened the interaction between DNase I and actin, and the enhanced release of DNase I was dependent on the number of carbon units in LAS. DNase I released by the LAS treatment translocated to the nucleus, in which DNase I attacked DNA and generated \u03b3-H2AX. These results suggested that the LAS-induced generation of \u03b3-H2AX could be attributed to the translocation of DNase I to the nucleus through the disruption of actin, and not to LAS-induced DNA damage.",

Since rAML is considered to originate from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC), we investigated the frequency and spectrum of radiation-induced chromosomal abnormalities in human CD34+ cells. We then measured stable chromosomal abnormalities, a possible biomarker of leukemia risk, in clonally expanded cell populations which were grown for 14 days in a 3D-matrix (CFU-assay). We compared two radiation qualities used in radiotherapy, sparsely ionizing X-rays and densely ionizing carbon ions (29 and 60\u201385\u00a0keV/\u03bcm, doses between 0.5 and 4\u00a0Gy). Only a negligible number of de novo arising, unstable aberrations (\u22640.05 aberrations/cell, 97% breaks) were measured in the descendants of irradiated HSPC. However, stable aberrations were detected in colonies formed by irradiated HSPC. All cells of the affected colonies exhibited one or more identical aberrations, indicating their clonal origin. The majority of the clonal rearrangements (92%) were simple exchanges such as translocations (77%) and pericentric inversions (15%), which are known to contribute to the development of rAML. Carbon ions were more efficient in inducing cell killing (maximum of \u223c30\u201335% apoptotic cells for 2\u00a0Gy carbon ions compared to \u223c25% for X-rays) and chromosomal aberrations in the first cell-cycle after exposure (\u223c70% and \u223c40% for 1\u00a0Gy of carbon ions and X-rays, respectively), with a higher fraction of non-transmissible aberrations. In contrast, for both radiation qualities the percentage of clones with chromosomal abnormalities was similar (40%). Using the frequency of colonies with clonal aberrations as a surrogate marker for the leukemia risk following radiotherapy of solid tumors, charged particle therapy is not expected to lead to an increased risk of leukemia in patients.",

     "abstract": "At present, a lot is known about biochemical aspects of double strand breaks (DBS) repair but how chromatin structure affects this process and the sensitivity of DNA to DSB induction is still an unresolved question. Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) patients are characterised by very high sensitivity to DSB-inducing agents such as ionising radiation. This radiosensitivity is revealed with an enhancement of chromosomal instability as a consequence of defective DNA repair for a small fraction of breaks located in the heterochromatin, where they are less accessible. Besides, recently it has been reported that Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) mediated signalling modifies chromatin structure. In order to study the impact of chromatin compaction on the chromosomal instability of A-T cells, the response to trichostatin-A, an histone deacetylase inhibitor, in normal and A-T lymphoblastoid cell lines was investigated testing its effect on chromosomal aberrations, cell cycle progression, DNA damage and repair after exposure to X-rays. The results suggest that the response to both trichostatin-A pre- and continuous treatments is independent of the presence of either functional or mutated ATM protein, as the reduction of chromosomal damage was found also in the wild-type cell line. The presence of trichostatin-A before exposure to X-rays could give rise to prompt DNA repair functioning on chromatin structure already in an open conformation. Differently, trichostatin-A post-treatment causing hyperacetylation of histone tails and reducing the heterochromatic DNA content might diminish the requirement for ATM and favour DSBs repair reducing chromosomal damage only in A-T cells. This fact could suggest that trichostatin-A post-treatment is favouring the slow component of DSB repair pathway, the one impaired in absence of a functionally ATM protein. Data obtained suggest a fundamental role of chromatin compaction on chromosomal instability in A-T cells.",

     "abstract": "To minimize the risk of tumorigenesis in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), G-banding analysis is widely used to detect chromosomal aberrations in MSCs. However, a critical limitation of G-banding is that it only reflects the status of metaphase cells, which can represent as few as 0.01% of tested cells. During routine cytogenetic testing in MSCs, we often detect chromosomal aberrations in minor cell populations. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether such a minority of cells can expand over time or if they ultimately disappear during MSC passaging. We passaged MSCs serially while monitoring quantitative changes for each aberrant clone among heterogeneous MSCs. To investigate the cytogenetic status of interphase cells, which represent the main population, we also performed interphase FISH analysis, in combination with G-banding and telomere length determination. In human adipose tissue-derived MSCs, 4 types of chromosomal aberrations were found during culturing, and in umbilical cord MSCs, 2 types of chromosomal aberrations were observed. Sequential dynamic changes among heterogeneous aberrant clones during passaging were similar to the dynamic changes observed in cancer stem cells during disease progression. Throughout all passages, the quantitative G-banding results were inconsistent with those of the interphase FISH analysis. Interphase FISH revealed hidden aberrations in stem cell populations with normal karyotypes by G-banding analysis. We found that telomere length gradually decreased during passaging until the point at which cytogenetic aberrations appeared. The present study demonstrates that rare aberrant clones at earlier passages can become predominant clones during later passages. Considering the risk of tumorigenesis due to aberrant MSCs, we believe that our results will help to establish proper safety guidelines for MSC use. In particular, we believe it is critical to test for chromosomal aberrations using both G-banding and FISH to ensure the safety of human stem cells that are manufactured in vitro for clinical applications.",

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that miRNAs contribute to the regulation of normal aging process, but their roles in progeroid disorders remain poorly understood. Here we report the miRNA transcriptomes of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) established from wild type (WT) and Zmpste24\u2212/\u2212 progeroid mice using a massively parallel sequencing technology.

A total of 8 miRNAs were found to be significantly down-regulated, with only 2 miRNAs upregulated, in Zmpste24\u2212/\u2212 MEFs as compared to WT MEFs.

Overexpression of miR-365 in Zmpste24\u2212/\u2212 MEFs increased cellular proliferation and decreased the percentage of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells, while inhibition of miR-365 function led to an increase of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells in WT MEFs. Furthermore, we identified Rasd1, a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTPases, as a functional target of miR-365. While expression of miR-365 suppressed Rasd1 3\u2032 UTR luciferase-reporter activity, this effect was lost with mutations in the putative 3\u2032 UTR target-site. Consistently, expression levels of miR-365 were found to inversely correlate with endogenous Rasd1 levels.

Independent of this mechanism 25\u00a0\u03bcM PO-1 decreased MCF-7 spheroid intravasation through the lymph endothelial barrier. Hence, PO-1 inhibits an early step of metastasis, impairs unrestricted proliferation and induces apoptosis at low micromolar concentrations. These results warrant further testing in vivo to challenge the potential of PO-1 as novel lead compound.",

     "abstract": "Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a genetic disease characterized by hypersensitivity to ultra-violet and a very high risk of skin cancer induction on exposed body sites. This syndrome is caused by germinal mutations on nucleotide excision repair genes. No cure is available for these patients except a complete protection from all types of UV radiations. We reviewed the various techniques to complement or to correct the genetic defect in XP cells. We, particularly, developed the correction of XP-C skin cells using the fidelity of the homologous recombination pathway during repair of double-strand break (DSB) in the presence of XPC wild type sequences. We used engineered nucleases (meganuclease or TALE nuclease) to induce a DSB located at 90\u00a0bp of the mutation to be corrected. Expression of specific TALE nuclease in the presence of a repair matrix containing a long stretch of homologous wild type XPC sequences allowed us a successful gene correction of the original TG deletion found in numerous North African XP patients. Some engineered nucleases are sensitive to epigenetic modifications, such as cytosine methylation. In case of methylated sequences to be corrected, modified nucleases or demethylation of the whole genome should be envisaged. Overall, we showed that specifically-designed TALE-nuclease allowed us to correct a 2\u00a0bp deletion in the XPC gene leading to patient's cells proficient for DNA repair and showing normal UV-sensitivity. The corrected gene is still in the same position in the human genome and under the regulation of its physiological promoter. This result is a first step toward gene therapy in XP patients.",

These lesions efficiently block the elongation of transcription and need to be rapidly removed by transcription-coupled NER (TC-NER) to avoid the induction of apoptosis. Twenty-nine genes have been classified to code for proteins participating in nucleotide excision repair (NER) in human cells. Here we explored the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of these NER genes across 13 human cell lines using Bru-seq and BruChase-seq, respectively. Many NER genes are relatively large in size and therefore will be easily inactivated by UV-induced transcription-blocking lesions. Furthermore, many of these genes produce transcripts that are rather unstable. Thus, these genes are expected to rapidly lose expression leading to a diminished function of NER. One such gene is ERCC6 that codes for the CSB protein critical for TC-NER. Due to its large gene size and high RNA turnover rate, the ERCC6 gene may act as dosimeter of DNA damage so that at high levels of damage, ERCC6 RNA levels would be diminished leading to the loss of CSB expression, inhibition of TC-NER and the promotion of cell death.",

We previously described a biphasic decrease and increase of epigenetic mark H3K56Ac in response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced DNA damage. Here, we report a new function of UV damaged DNA-binding protein (DDB) in deacetylation of H3K56Ac through specific histone deacetylases (HDACs). We show that simultaneous depletion of HDAC1/2 compromises the deacetylation of H3K56Ac, while depletion of HDAC1 or HDAC2 alone has no effect on H3K56Ac. The H3K56Ac deacetylation does not require functional nucleotide excision repair (NER) factors XPA and XPC, but depends on the function of upstream factors DDB1 and DDB2. UVR enhances the association of DDB2 with HDAC1 and, enforced DDB2 expression leads to translocation of HDAC1 to UVR-damaged chromatin. HDAC1 and HDAC2 are recruited to UVR-induced DNA damage spots, which are visualized by anti-XPC immunofluorescence. Dual HDAC1/2 depletion decreases XPC ubiquitination, but does not affect the recruitment of DDB2 to DNA damage. By contrast, the local accumulation of \u03b3H2AX at UVR-induced DNA damage spots was compromised upon HDAC1 as well as dual HDAC1/2 depletions. Additionally, UVR-induced ATM activation decreased in H12899 cells expressing H3K56Ac-mimicing H3K56Q. These results revealed a novel role of DDB in H3K56Ac deacetylation during early step of NER and the existence of active functional cross-talk between DDB-mediated damage recognition and H3K56Ac deacetylation.",

DNA damage induced by ROS is a byproduct of cellular respiration and accumulation of damage over time, is a fundamental aspect of a main theory of aging. Mitochondria have a pivotal role in generating cellular oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been associated with several diseases. DNA base excision repair is considered the major pathway for repair of oxidized bases in DNA both in the nuclei and in mitochondria, and in neurons this mechanism is particularly important because non-diving cells have limited back-up DNA repair mechanisms. An association between elevated oxidative stress and a decrease in BER is strongly related to the aging process and has special relevance in age-related neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review the role of DNA repair in aging, focusing on the implications of the DNA base excision repair pathways and how alterations in expression of these DNA repair proteins are related to the aging process and to age-related neurodegenerative diseases.",

     "abstract": "Previous findings describe Fe65 as a key protein in the cellular response to genotoxic stress. However, the precise molecular mechanism by which Fe65 contributes to DNA damage signaling remains unclear. In this study, we hypothesized that the transcriptional activity of Fe65 may contribute to DNA damage pathways by regulating gene expression patterns activated in response to genotoxic stress. To address this hypothesis, we mapped the global binding profile of Fe65 by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-sequencing in the SK-N-SH cells exposed to genotoxic stress. Unexpectedly, the genome-wide location analysis showed a substantial enrichment of Fe65 in the promoter regions of coding genes linked to DNA damage signaling pathways. To further investigate the role of Fe65 in the transcriptional regulation of putative coding target genes identified by ChIP-seq, we performed microarray assays using wild-type (WT) or Fe65 deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) exposed to oxidative stress with multiple recovery times. Gene ontology analysis of the Fe65-depedent transcriptome suggested that Fe65 modulates the expression of genes critical for DNA damage response. Motif enrichment analysis of regulatory regions occupied by Fe65 revealed a strong correlation with key transcription factors involved in DNA damage signaling pathways, including E2F1, p53, and Jun. Comparison of ChIP-sequencing results with microarray results ultimately identified 248 Fe65-depedent target genes, the majority of which were known regulators of cell cycle, cell death, and DNA replication and repair pathways. We validated the target genes identified by in silico analysis by qPCR experiments. Collectively, our results provide strong evidence that Fe65 plays a role in DNA damage response and cell viability by epigenomic regulation of specific transcriptional programs activated upon genotoxic stress.",

To investigate these effects, in a controlled genetic background, base excision repair (BER) activities were measured in protein extracts obtained from Wistar rat brains from different genders and defined PMI up to 24\u00a0hours, using a novel fluorescent-based in vitro incision assay. Uracil and AP-site incision activity in nuclear and mitochondrial extracts were similar in all groups included in this study. Our results show that gender and PMI up to 24\u00a0hours have no influence in the activities of the BER proteins UDG and APE1 in rat brains. These findings demonstrate that these variables do not interfere on the BER activities included in these study, and provide a security window to work with UDG and APE1 proteins in samples of post mortem origin.",

     "abstract": "Successful maintenance of metabolic systems relating to accurate DNA replication and repair is critical for optimal lifelong human health. Should this homeostatic balance become impaired, genomic instability events can arise, compromising the integrity of the genome, which may result in gene expression and human disease. Both genome instability and micronutrient imbalance have been identified and implicated in diseases associated with accelerated ageing which potentially leads to an increased risk for the future development of clinically defined neurodegenerative disorders. Cognitive decline leading to the clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been shown to predict an increased risk in later life of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Knowledge on the impact of dietary factors in relation to MCI and AD risk is improving but incomplete; in particular the role of nutrient combinations (i.e. nutriomes) has not been thoroughly investigated. Currently, there is a need for preventative strategies as well as the identification of robust and reproducible diagnostic biomarkers that will allow identification of those individuals with increased risk for neurodegenerative diseases. Growing evidence suggests cells originating from different somatic tissues derived from individuals that have been clinically diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders exhibit elevated frequencies of DNA damage compared to tissues of cognitively normal individuals which could be due to malnutrition. The objective of this review is to discuss current evidence and identify knowledge gaps relating to genome instability biomarkers and blood micronutrient profiles from human studies of MCI and AD that may be specific to and contribute to the increased risk of these diseases. This is a vital step in order to create research strategies for the future development of diagnostics that are indicative of dementia risk and to inform preventative therapies.",

Those studies allowed to demonstrate that oxidative DNA damage is one of the earliest detectable events in neurodegeneration, but also revealed cytogenetic damage in neurodegenerative conditions, such as for example a tendency towards chromosome 21 malsegregation in Alzheimer's disease. As it happens for many neurodegenerative risk factors the question of whether DNA damage is cause or consequence of the neurodegenerative process is still open, and probably both is true. The research interest in markers of oxidative stress was shifted, in recent years, towards the search of epigenetic biomarkers of neurodegenerative disorders, following the accumulating evidence of a substantial contribution of epigenetic mechanisms to learning, memory processes, behavioural disorders and neurodegeneration. Increasing evidence is however linking DNA damage and repair with epigenetic phenomena, thereby opening the way to a very attractive and timely research topic in neurodegenerative diseases. We will address those issues in the context of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which represent three of the most common neurodegenerative pathologies in humans.",

Hyperglycemia, a T2D hallmark, is related to several metabolic complications, comorbidities and increased DNA damage. However, the molecular alterations of a proper glucose control are still unclarified. In this study, we aimed to evaluate DNA damage (comet assay), as well as to compare the transcriptional expression (mRNA and miRNA analyzed by the microarray technique) displayed by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from three distinct groups: hyperglycemic T2D patients (T2D-H, n\u00a0=\u00a014), non-hyperglycemic T2D patients (T2D-N, n\u00a0=\u00a015), and healthy non-diabetic individuals (n\u00a0=\u00a016). The comet assay revealed significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) higher levels of DNA damage in T2D-H group compared to both T2D-N and control groups, while a significant difference was not observed between the control and T2D-N groups. After bioinformatics analysis, the differentially expressed mRNAs were subjected to functional enrichment analysis (DAVID) and inflammatory response was among the enriched terms found when comparing T2D-N with controls and T2D-H with T2D-N. Concerning the gene set enrichment and gene set analyses, among the differentially expressed gene sets, three were of interest: regulation of DNA repair (T2D-H versus T2D-N), superoxide response (T2D-H versus control group), and response to endoplasmic reticulum stress (T2D-H versus control group). We also identified miRNAs related with T2D and hyperglycemia not yet associated with these conditions in the literature. Some of the differentially expressed mRNAs were among the predicted targets of the differentially expressed miRNAs. Our results showed the association of hyperglycemia with increased DNA damage and aberrant expression of miRNAs and genes related to several biological processes, such as inflammation, DNA repair, ROS production and antioxidant defense, highlighting the importance of proper glycemic control. Moreover, the transcriptional expression of miRNAs provided novel information for understanding the regulatory mechanisms involved in the T2D progression.",

Furthermore, there is a clearly defined relationship among fat mass expansion, chronic low-grade systemic inflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation; leading to ROS-related pathological events. In the past years, genome-wide association studies have generated convincing evidence associating genetic variation at multiple regions of the genome with traits that reflect obesity. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the relationships among the gene polymorphisms ghrelin (GHRL\u2013rs26802), ghrelin receptor (GHSR\u2013rs572169), leptin (LEP\u2013rs7799039), leptin receptor (LEPR\u2013rs1137101) and fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO\u2013rs9939609) and obesity. The relationships among these gene variants and the amount of DNA damage were also investigated. Three hundred Caucasian morbidly obese and 300 eutrophic (controls) women were recruited. In summary, the results demonstrated that the frequencies of the GHRL, GHSR, LEP and LEPR polymorphisms were not different between Brazilian white morbidly obese and eutrophic women. Exceptions were the AA-FTO genotype and allele A, which were significantly more frequent in obese women than in the controls (0.23% vs. 0.10%; 0.46 vs. 0.36, respectively), and the TT-FTO genotype and the T allele, which were less frequent in morbidly obese women (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Furthermore, significant differences in the amount of genetic lesions associated with FTO variants were observed only in obese women. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the analyzed SNPs were not closely associated with morbid obesity, suggesting they are not the major contributors to obesity. Therefore, our data indicated that these gene variants are not good biomarkers for predicting risk susceptibility for obesity, whereas ROS generated by the inflammatory status might be one of the causes of DNA damage in obese women, favoring genetically related diseases as obesity comorbidities.",

The follow-up includes persons until December 2009 with 877 breast cancer cases. All models agree on the risk estimates. The excess relative and excess absolute risk at the age of 50 years are 0.48\u00a0Gy\u22121 (95% CI 0.28; 0.69) and 10.4 ( 10 4 PYR Gy ) \u2212 1 (95% CI 6.1; 14.4), respectively. These risk estimates are about a factor of 2 higher than previous analyses of this cohort as a consequence of the re-evaluation of the dosimetry system.Explicit models incorporating effects of genomic instability were developed and applied to the hemangioma cohort. It was found that a radiation-induced transition towards genomic instability was highly significant. The models indicate that the main effect of radiation-induced genomic instability is to increase the rate of transition of non-initiated cells to initiated cells with a proliferative advantage. The magnitude of such an acceleration cannot be inferred from epidemiological data alone, but must be complemented by radiobiological measurements.",

Up-to-date, more than 1900 mutations have been reported in CFTR. However for an important proportion of them, their functional effects and the relation to disease are still not understood. Many of these mutations are silent (or synonymous), namely they do not alter the encoded amino acid. These synonymous mutations have been considered as neutral to protein function.

With the aim of understanding possible functional effects of synonymous mutations in CFTR, we analyzed human and primates CFTR codon usage and divergence patterns. We report the presence of regions enriched in rare and frequent codons. This spatial pattern of codon preferences is conserved in primates, but this cannot be explained by sequence conservation alone. In sum, the results presented herein suggest a functional implication of these regions of the gene that may be maintained by purifying selection acting to preserve a particular codon usage pattern along the sequence. Overall these results support the idea that several synonymous mutations in CFTR may have functional importance, and could be involved in the disease.",

     "abstract": "Single-molecule PCR (SM-PCR) analysis of long and repetitive DNA sequences, known as expanded simple tandem repeats (ESTRs), has been the most efficient method for studying germline mutation induction in endogenous sequences to date. However, the long length of these sequences makes mutation detection imprecise and laborious, and they have been characterized only in mice. Here, we explore the use of unstable microsatellite sequences that can be typed with high precision by capillary electrophoresis as alternative loci for detecting germline mutations. We screened 24 microsatellite loci across inbred mouse strains and identified Mm2.2.1 as the most polymorphic microsatellite locus. We then optimized SM-PCR of Mm2.2.1 to detect mutations in sperm. SM-PCR analysis of sperm from untreated B6C3F1 and Muta\u2122Mouse samples revealed mutation frequencies that are consistent with rates derived from family pedigree analysis (\u223c5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123). To determine whether this locus can be used to detect chemically induced germline mutations, Muta\u2122Mouse males were exposed by oral gavage to a single dose of 100\u00a0mg/kg of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) or to 100\u00a0mg/kg of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) for 28 days alongside vehicle treated controls. Sperm were collected 10 weeks post-ENU exposure to sample sperm exposed as spermatogonial stem cells and 6 weeks post-BaP exposure to sample sperm that were dividing spermatogonia when the exposure was terminated. Both treatments resulted in a significant (approximately 2-fold) increase in mutation frequency in sperm compared to the control animals. The work establishes the utility of this microsatellite for studying mutation induction in the germ cells of mice. Because microsatellites are found in virtually every species, this approach holds promise for other organisms, including humans.",

Recent studies have established that circadian alterations play an important role in the susceptibility to many human diseases, including cancer.

Using microarrays, the patterns of gene expression were established for brain, kidney, liver and spleen samples from the non-exposed offspring of irradiated CBA/Ca and BALB/c male mice. The most over-represented categories among the genes differentially expressed in the offspring of control and irradiated males were those involved in rhythmic process, circadian rhythm and DNA-dependent regulation of transcription. The results of our study therefore provide a plausible explanation for the transgenerational effects of paternal irradiation, including increased transgenerational carcinogenesis described in other studies.",

Using the repair of a well-characterized and ubiquitous adduct, the abasic (AP) site, as a model, we have developed a comprehensive method of monitoring DNA lesion-specific recruitment of proteins in vivo over time. We utilized a surrogate system in which a Cy3-labeled plasmid containing a single AP-site was transfected into cells, and the interaction of the labeled DNA with BER enzymes, including APE1, Pol\u03b2, LIG1, and FEN1, was monitored by immunofluorescent staining of the enzymes by Alexafluor-488-conjugated secondary antibody. The recruitment of enzymes was characterized by quantification of Cy3-Alexafluor-488 co-localization. To validate the microscopy-based method, repair of the transfected AP-site DNA was also quantified at various time points post-transfection using a real time PCR-based method. Notably, the recruitment time kinetics for each enzyme were consistent with AP-site repair time kinetics. This microscopy-based methodology is reliable in detecting the recruitment of proteins to specific DNA substrates and can be extended to study other in vivo DNA\u2013protein relationships in any DNA sequence and in the context of any DNA structure in transfectable proliferating or quiescent cells. The method may be applied to a variety of disciplines of nucleic acid transaction pathways, including repair, replication, transcription, and recombination.",

Toward this goal, PBMCs isolated from 77 subjects from high-level natural radiation areas (HLNRA) and 37 subjects from a nearby normal level natural radiation area (NLNRA) were challenged with 2\u00a0Gy and 4\u00a0Gy gamma radiation. Subjects from HLNRA were classified based on the mean annual effective dose received, into low dose group (LDG) and high dose group (HDG) with mean annual effective doses of 2.69\u00a0mSv (N\u00a0=\u00a043, range 1.07\u00a0mSv\u00a0year\u22121 to 5.55\u00a0mSv\u00a0year\u22121) and 9.62\u00a0mSv (N\u00a0=\u00a034, range 6.07\u00a0mSv\u00a0year\u22121 to17.41\u00a0mSv\u00a0year\u22121), respectively. DNA strand breaks and repair kinetics (at 7\u00a0min, 15\u00a0min and 30\u00a0min after 4\u00a0Gy) were evaluated using the alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay. Initial levels of DNA strand breaks observed after either a 2\u00a0Gy or a 4\u00a0Gy challenging dose were significantly lower in subjects of the HDG from HLNRA compared to subjects of NLNRA (2\u00a0Gy, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; 4\u00a0Gy, P\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and LDG (2\u00a0Gy P\u00a0=\u00a00.01; 4\u00a0Gy, P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Subjects of HDG from HLNRA showed enhanced rejoining of DNA strand breaks (HDG/NLNRA, P\u00a0=\u00a00.06) during the early stage of repair (within 7\u00a0min). However at later times a similar rate of rejoining of strand breaks was observed across the groups (HDG, LDG and NLNRA). Preliminary results from our study suggest in vivo chronic low-level natural radiation provides an initial exposure that allows an adaptation to a subsequent higher radiation exposure, perhaps through improving DNA repair via an unknown mechanism. Therefore, further investigations would be necessary in this population to understand the biological and health effects of chronic low-level natural radiation exposures.",

Here we present the quantitative data describing the extent of the spontaneous DNA damage in 144 SHK mice of various ages. In each animal, we assessed double strand breaks, single strand breaks and alkali-labile sites, as well as amounts of oxidized purines, oxidized pyrimidines and misincorporated uracils. In addition, overall levels of genome DNA methylation were evaluated. The amounts of oxidized pyrimidines were correlated with age in males only, while the amounts of double strand breaks (DSB) in DNA samples were correlated with age in females only (R\u00a0=\u00a00.26; p\u00a0<\u00a00.035). No age-related accumulation of single-strand breaks (SSB) was observed. The hypomethylation of DNA was significant in aging females, but not in aging males. Various types of DNA damage were correlated to each other. In attempt to develop more stable indicator of age-dependent alterations in DNA, the DNA Damage Level Differential (DDLD) indices was developed for comet assaying of peripheral blood leukocytes. As expected, DDLD index was shown to be better correlated with age than any single quantitative measure reflecting certain type of DNA damage. A variability of effectiveness of various kinds of DNA repair in individual animals was larger than expected. This conclusion may have a substantial impact on subsequent studies of the mutagens and other kinds of environmental stressors in animal populations. Nor DDLD neither individual quantitative measures of DNA damage were capable of prediction post-sampling survival time.",

MSUD patients generally present ketoacidosis, poor feeding, ataxia, coma, psychomotor delay, mental retardation and brain abnormalites. Treatment consists of dietary restriction of the BCAA (low protein intake) supplemented by a BCAA-free amino acid mixture. Although the mechanisms of brain damage in MSUD are poorly known, previous studies have shown that oxidative stress may be involved in the neuropathology of this disorder. In this regard, it was recently reported that MSUD patients have deficiency of l-carnitine (l-car), a compound with antioxidant properties that is used as adjuvant therapy in various inborn errors of metabolism. In this work, we investigated DNA damage determined by the alkaline comet assay in peripheral whole blood leukocytes of MSUD patients submitted to a BCAA-restricted diet supplemented or not with l-car. We observed a significant increase of DNA damage index (DI) in leukocytes from MSUD patients under BCAA-restricted diet as compared to controls and that l-car supplementation significantly decreased DNA DI levels. It was also found a positive correlation between DI and MDA content, a marker of lipid peroxidation, and an inverse correlation between DI and l-car levels. Taken together, our present results suggest a role for reactive species and the involvement of oxidative stress in DNA damage in this disorder. Since l-car reduced DNA damage, it is presumed that dietary supplementation of this compound may serve as an adjuvant therapeutic strategy for MSUD patients in addition to other therapies.",

We used a cell-based DSBs system whereby, upon induction of an inducible restriction enzyme AsiSI, hundreds of site-specific DSBs are generated across the genome to investigate the role of MYC proteins on DSB. We found that high levels of MYC do not block accumulation of \u03b3H2AX at AsiSI sites, but delay its clearance, indicating an inefficient repair, while the initial recognition of DNA damage is largely unaffected. Repair of both homologous and nonhomologous repair-prone segments, characterized by high or low levels of recruited RAD51, respectively, was delayed. Collectively, these data indicate that high levels of MYC proteins delay the resolution of DNA lesions engineered to occur in cell cultures.",

Therefore, inhibition of PARP1 has a great potential for use in cancer therapy. As resistance to PARP inhibitors is starting to be observed in patients, thus the function of PARP-1 needs to be studied in depth in order to find new therapeutic targets. To gain more information on the PARP-1 activity, we expressed PARP-1 in yeast and investigated its effect on cell growth and UV induced homologous recombination. To identify candidate genes affecting PARP-1 activity and cellular localization, we also developed a yeast genome wide genetic screen.We found that PARP-1 strongly inhibited yeast growth, but when yeast was exposed to the PARP-1 inhibitor 6(5-H) phenantridinone (PHE), it recovered from the growth suppression. Moreover, we showed that PARP-1 produced PAR products in yeast and we demonstrated that PARP-1 reduced UV-induced homologous recombination. By genome wide screening, we identified 99 mutants that suppressed PARP-1 growth inhibition. Orthologues of human genes were found for 41 of these yeast genes. We determined whether the PARP-1 protein level was altered in strains which are deleted for the transcription regulator GAL3, the histone H1 gene HHO1, the HUL4 gene, the deubiquitination enzyme gene OTU1, the nuclear pore protein POM152 and the SNT1 that encodes for the Set3C subunit of the histone deacetylase complex. In these strains the PARP-1 level was roughly the same as in the wild type. PARP-1 localized in the nucleus more in the snt1\u0394 than in the wild type strain; after UV radiation, PARP-1 localized in the nucleus more in hho1 and pom152 deletion strains than in the wild type indicating that these functions may have a role on regulating PARP-1 level and activity in the nucleus.",

Intervention with compounds of natural origin (\u201cphytochemicals\u201d) is considered an effective means to prevent cancer development and favorably modulate the underlying mechanisms, including DNA adduct formation.

Of the ten agents tested, resveratrol (648\u00a0\u00b1\u00a026 adducts/109 nucleotides), oltipraz (1007\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0348 adducts/109 nucleotides), delphinidin (1252\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0142 adducts/109 nucleotides), tanshinone I (1981\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0213 adducts/109 nucleotides), tanshinone IIA (2606\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0478 adducts/109 nucleotides) and diindoylmethane (3643\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0469 adducts/109 nucleotides) were the most effective compared to vehicle treatment (14,062\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01097 adducts/109 nucleotides).

Total, free and conjugated BPA were measured in their blood using GC\u2013MS with isotopic dilution. The results show a correlation between environmental exposure to BPA and the genesis of fetal malformations. Conjugated BPA, which was higher in the CL, casts light on the hypothesis that a reduced ability to metabolize the chemical in the mother can concur to the occurrence of malformation. In a more detailed manner, in case of chromosomal malformations, the average value of free BPA appears to be nearly three times greater than that of the controls.

Several studies have reported that defects in WRN function are responsible for not only progeria syndrome but also genomic instability via the deregulation of DNA repair, replication, recombination, and telomere stability. Given the importance of WRN in the repair process, we herein investigated the potential role of WRN in drug response by evaluating the DNA repair following exposure to cisplatin in human cancer cell lines. We found that the down-regulation of SIRT1 and inhibition of SIRT1 deacetylase activity blocked the translocation of WRN from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in response to genotoxic stresses. In addition, cells expressing low levels of WRN responded favorably to cisplatin, whereas cells expressing high levels responded poorly to cisplatin. The forced expression of WRN protein in chemosensitive cells resulted in an approximately two-fold increase in cell viability in response to cisplatin compared with vector controls and promoted DNA repair, while WRN-deficient cells accumulate unrepaired double-strand breaks following cisplatin exposure. These results suggest that WRN is regulated by SIRT1 and increased expression of WRN might be one of the determinants for the development of chemotherapeutic drug resistance.",

The present work investigates the cytotoxic, genotoxic, and epigenetic (DNA methylation) effect of MWCNT on the plant system- Allium cepa. MWCNT uptake in root cells significantly altered cellular morphology. Membrane integrity and mitochondrial function were also compromised. The nanotubes induced significant DNA damage, micronucleus formation and chromosome aberration. DNA laddering assay revealed the formation of internucleosomal fragments, which is indicative of apoptotic cell death. This finding was confirmed by an accumulation of cells in the sub-G0 phase of the cell cycle. An increase in CpG methylation was observed using the isoschizomers MspI/HpaII. HPLC analysis of DNA samples revealed a significant increase in the levels of 5-methyl-deoxy-cytidine (5mdC). These results confirm the cyto-genotoxic effect of MWCNT in the plant system and simultaneously highlight the importance of this epigenetic study in nanoparticle toxicity.",

AOM\u00a0+\u00a0DSS efficiently and rapidly produces colon tumors in B6 mice. AOM produces promutagenic O6-methylguanine lesions in DNA but does not induce colon tumors in C57Bl/6 mice as a single agent.

The MF in the untreated and DSS treated WT and TCR\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice was the same (<10\u22125) indicating that DSS and subsequent inflammation does not generate stem cell mutations in mice that are WT for DNA repair.

The combined treatment of AOM\u00a0+\u00a0DSS afforded fully mutated crypts in both strains with a statistically significant lower MF in the TCR\u03b2\u2212/\u2212 mice. In addition, the MF in both strains of mice after the combination of AOM\u00a0+\u00a0DSS is lower than observed with AOM alone indicating that DSS inflammation destroyed pre-existing AOM mutated crypts. Using the MF in WT mice, the efficiency for the conversion of promutagenic O6-methylguanine lesions into a stem cell mutations was calculated to be \u223c0.4%.",

This study aimed to investigate the signal transduction pathway responsible for B[a]P-induced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) development. We exposed the human NSCLC cell lines Calu-1, CL3, H1299, CH27, H23, and H1355 to B[a]P and assessed cell cycle progression using flow cytometry. Expression of cell cycle mediators was measured using Western blot analyses and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). B[a]P exposure dramatically induced S-phase accumulation in H1355 cells. Phospho-p53 (Ser15 and Ser20), phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, and Bax were significantly increased in H1355 cells whereas phospho-Rb was decreased in these cells. In addition, B[a]P induced phosphorylation of checkpoint kinase-1 (Chk1) but not Chk2. EMSA experiments revealed a slower migrating band after c-Myc bound the E-box in response to B[a]P treatment, which was abolished upon the addition of the ERK inhibitor PD98059 in H1355 cells. Phospho-ERK inhibition and dominant negative mutant Chk1 expression reversed B[a]P-induced S phase accumulation and downregulated phospho-Chk1 and phospho-ERK expression. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of ERK and its downstream mediator Chk1 may contribute to B[a]P-induced S phase accumulation in H1355 cells. The results could help in the development of lung cancer treatments that target the Chk1 pathway through ERK.",

     "abstract": "Doxorubicin is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug that intercalates between DNA base-pairs and poisons Topoisomerase II, although the mechanistic basis for cell killing remains speculative. Doxorubicin and related anthracycline compounds have been shown to increase nucleosome turnover and/or eviction around promoters, which suggests that the resulting enhanced exposure of DNA might underlie cell killing. Previously, we showed that low doses of anthracyclines increase nucleosome turnover around active gene promoters, which suggests that loss of nucleosomes might contribute to cancer cell killing. Here we apply a genome-wide method to precisely map DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in cancer cells. We find that spontaneous DSBs occur preferentially around promoters of active genes, and that both anthracyclines and etoposide, a Topoisomerase II poison, increase DSBs around promoters, although CpG islands are conspicuously protected from DSBs. We propose that torsion-based enhancement of nucleosome turnover by anthracyclines exposes promoter DNA, ultimately causing DSBs around promoters.",

Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1), a chromatin-organizing protein encoded by the Suppressor of variegation 205 [Su(var)205] gene, also plays a role in this regulation. To assess the mutational impact of weakening the system for transposon regulation, we measured the frequency of recessive X-linked lethal mutations occurring in the germ lines of males from stocks that were heterozygous for mutant alleles of the ago3, aub, piwi, or Su(var)205 genes. These mutant alleles are expected to deplete the wild-type proteins encoded by these genes by as much as 50%. The mutant alleles of piwi and Su(var)205 significantly increased the X-linked lethal mutation frequency, whereas the mutant alleles of ago3 did not. An increased mutation frequency was also observed in males from one of two mutant aub stocks, but this increase may not have been due to the aub mutant. The increased mutation frequency caused by depleting Piwi or HP1suggests that chromatin-organizing proteins play important roles in minimizing the germ-line mutation rate, possibly by stabilizing the structure of the heterochromatin in which many transposons are situated.",

Therefore, the question whether radiation effects could be modulated by microgravity is an important aspect in such risk evaluation. Space particles at low dose and fluence rate, directly affect only a fraction of cells in the whole organism, which implement radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE) in cellular response to space radiation exposure. The fact that all of the RIBE experiments are carried out in a normal gravity condition bring forward the need for evidence regarding the effect of microgravity on RIBE. In the present study, a two-dimensional rotation clinostat was adopted to demonstrate RIBE in microgravity conditions, in which the RIBE was assayed using an experimental system of root-localized irradiation of Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) plants. The results showed that the modeled microgravity inhibited significantly the RIBE-mediated up-regulation of expression of the AtRAD54 and AtRAD51 genes, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and transcriptional activation of multicopy P35S:GUS, but made no difference to the induction of homologous recombination by RIBE, showing divergent responses of RIBE to the microgravity conditions. The time course of interaction between the modeled microgravity and RIBE was further investigated, and the results showed that the microgravity mainly modulated the processes of the generation or translocation of the bystander signal(s) in roots.",

     "abstract": "Somatic mutations in the tumour suppressor gene TP53 occur in more than 50% of human tumours; in some instances exposure to environmental carcinogens can be linked to characteristic mutational signatures. The Hupki (human TP53 knock-in) mouse embryo fibroblast (HUF) immortalization assay (HIMA) is a useful model for studying the impact of environmental carcinogens on TP53 mutagenesis. In an effort to increase the frequency of TP53-mutated clones achievable in the HIMA, we generated nucleotide excision repair (NER)-deficient HUFs by crossing the Hupki mouse with an Xpa-knockout (Xpa-Null) mouse. We hypothesized that carcinogen-induced DNA adducts would persist in the TP53 sequence of Xpa-Null HUFs leading to an increased propensity for mismatched base pairing and mutation during replication of adducted DNA. We found that Xpa-Null Hupki mice, and HUFs derived from them, were more sensitive to the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) than their wild-type (Xpa-WT) counterparts. Following treatment with the reactive metabolite of BaP, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), Xpa-WT and Xpa-Null HUF cultures were subjected to the HIMA. A significant increase in TP53 mutations on the transcribed strand was detected in Xpa-Null HUFs compared to Xpa-WT HUFs, but the TP53-mutant frequency overall was not significantly different between the two genotypes. BPDE induced mutations primarily at G:C base pairs, with approximately half occurring at CpG sites, and the predominant mutation type was G:C\u00a0>\u00a0T:A in both Xpa-WT and Xpa-Null cells. Further, several of the TP53 mutation hotspots identified in smokers\u2019 lung cancer were mutated by BPDE in HUFs (codons 157, 158, 245, 248, 249, 273). Therefore, the pattern and spectrum of BPDE-induced TP53 mutations in the HIMA are consistent with TP53 mutations detected in lung tumours of smokers. While Xpa-Null HUFs exhibited increased sensitivity to BPDE-induced damage on the transcribed strand, NER-deficiency did not enhance TP53 mutagenesis resulting from damage on the non-transcribed strand in this model.",

     "abstract": "The mitochondrion role changes during the digenetic life cycle of African trypanosomes. Owing to the low abundance of glucose in the insect vector (tsetse flies) the parasites are dependent upon a fully functional mitochondrion, capable of performing oxidative phosphorylation. Nevertheless, inside the mammalian host (bloodstream forms), which is rich in nutrients, parasite proliferation relies on glycolysis, and the mitochondrion is partially redundant. In this work we perform a comparative study of the mitochondrial genome (kinetoplast) in different strains of Trypanosoma vivax. The comparison was conducted between a West African strain that goes through a complete life cycle and two American strains that are mechanically transmitted (by different vectors) and remain as bloodstream forms only. It was found that while the African strain has a complete and apparently fully functional kinetoplast, the American T. vivax strains have undergone a drastic process of mitochondrial genome degradation, in spite of the recent introduction of these parasites in America. Many of their genes exhibit different types of mutations that are disruptive of function such as major deletions, frameshift causing indels and missense mutations. Moreover, all but three genes (A6-ATPase, RPS12 and MURF2) are not edited in the American strains, whereas editing takes place normally in all (editable) genes from the African strain. Two of these genes, A6-ATPase and RPS12, are known to play an essential function during bloodstream stage. Analysis of the minicircle population shows that its diversity has been greatly reduced, remaining mostly those minicircles that carry guide RNAs necessary for the editing of A6-ATPase and RPS12. The fact that these two genes remain functioning normally, as opposed to that reported in Trypanosoma brucei-like trypanosomes that restrict their life cycle to the bloodstream forms, along with other differences, is indicative that the American T. vivax strains are following a novel evolutionary pathway.",

Importance of modifications like phosphorylation of histone variant H2A.X in DNA repair is very well understood, however, ambiguous results exist in literature regarding the levels of certain histone modifications and their possible role in repair. In the present study, we have investigated in depth the alteration in the level of the highly dynamic histone mark H3S10P as it plays a dual role in different phases of the cell cycle. We show here that H3S10P decreases specifically from irradiated G1-enriched cells irrespective of the damaging agent or the cell line used in the study. Interestingly, the loss occurs predominantly from H3.3 variant which is a transcription activation mark like H3S10P itself, suggesting that the alteration might be implicated in transcription repression. The decrease in other transcription marks like H3K9Ac, H3K14Ac, H3K56Ac and H3S28P along with the occurrence of chromatin condensation in response to DNA damage in G1 phase strengthens the hypothesis. In addition, the alteration in the level of H3S10P shows an inverse correlation with that of \u03b3H2AX in a dose-dependent manner and probably occurs from the same mononucleosome. We propose that the drop in the levels of histone H3S10 phosphorylation is a universal phenomenon in response to DNA damage and is a trigger to induce transcription repressive state to facilitate repair.",

The radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) between the CSCs and NSCCs was measured by imaging 53BP1 foci, a widely used indicator for DNA double strand break (DSB). CSCs were found to be less active than NSCCs in both the generation and the response of bystander signals. Moreover, the nitric oxide (NO) scavenger c-PTIO can effectively alleviate the bystander effect in bystander NSCCs but not in bystander CSCs, indicating a difference of the two cell subtypes in NO signal response.

The tumour suppressor gene p53 is implicated in the regulation of DNA repair, and heterozygous p53 knockouts have an attenuated nucleotide excision repair response to AFB1. Male heterozygous p53 knockout mice and their wild-type controls were exposed to 0, 0.2 or 1.0\u00a0ppm AFB1 for 26 weeks in their diet. BER activity of lung and liver was assessed with an in vitro assay, using 8-OHdG-damaged plasmid DNA as a substrate.

In wild-type mice, repair was 65% lower in liver extracts from mice exposed to 1.0\u00a0ppm AFB1 than in liver extracts from mice exposed to 0.2\u00a0ppm AFB1 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), but not significantly lower than that in liver extracts from control mice. AFB1 did not affect BER in lung extracts from wild-type mice, or in lung and liver extracts from heterozygous p53 knockout mice. In liver and lung, AFB1 exposure did not alter levels of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase protein, a key enzyme in the repair of 8-OHdG, and did not cause hepatotoxicity, as indicated by plasma alanine aminotransferase levels.

BER activity was lower in livers from p53 wild type mice exposed to 1.0\u00a0ppm AFB1 versus those exposed to 0.2\u00a0ppm AFB1, an effect that was not attributable to liver cell death or altered levels of 8-oxoguanine glycosylase.",

Combined analysis showed that subjects carrying 3 or 4 risk alleles had a significantly increased risk of CAD, relative to those with 0\u20132 risk alleles (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.61, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.20\u20132.15). Moreover, CAD patients with 3 or 4 risk alleles also had significantly higher Gensini scores than those with 0\u20132 risk alleles (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Further haplotype-based analysis revealed that individuals with C-G-C-C, T-G-A-A, and T-A-A-A haplotypes indicated a higher prevalence of CAD (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.88, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03\u20133.43; OR\u00a0=\u00a02.26, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.19\u20134.31; OR\u00a0=\u00a02.66, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.34\u20135.25, respectively), compared to individuals with the most common C-G-A-C haplotype. In conclusion, our study demonstrates for the first time that common polymorphisms of H19 are associated with the risk and severity of CAD in a Chinese population. Future studies are needed to explore the underlying mechanisms of our findings.",

The present study found that micronuclei (MN) formation could be induced in the non-irradiated HL-7702 hepatocyte cells after being treated with the conditioned medium from irradiated hepatoma HepG2 and SK-Hep-1 cells under either normoxia or hypoxia. This bystander response was dramatically diminished or enhanced when the SirT1 gene of irradiated hepatoma cells was overexpressed or knocked down, respectively, especially under hypoxia. Meanwhile, SirT1 knockdown promoted transcriptional activity for c-Myc and facilitated ROS accumulation. But both of the increased bystander responses and ROS generation due to SirT1-knockdown were almost completely suppressed by c-Myc interference. Moreover, ROS scavenger effectively abolished the RIBE triggered by irradiated hepatoma cells even with SirT1 depletion. These findings provide new insights that SirT1 has a profound role in regulating RIBE where a c-Myc-dependent release of ROS may be involved.",

CHF rats subjected to chronic stress presented a more pronounced DNA damage in the hippocampus and NAc. NMDAR1 were increased in the prefrontal cortex (PC), hippocampus and amygdala of CHF, and decreased in the hippocampus, amygdala and NAc of CHF stressed. NMDAR2A were decreased in the amygdala of the CHF and stressed; and increased in CHF stressed. NMDRA2A in the NAc was increased after stress, and decreased in the CLF. NMDAR2B were increased in the hippocampus of CLF and CHF. In the amygdala, there was a decrease in the NMDAR2B for stress in the CLF and CHF. NMDAR2B in the NAc were decreased for stress and increased in the CHF; in the PC NMDAR2B increased in the CHF. EAAT1 increased in the PC of CLF\u00a0+\u00a0stress. In the hippocampus, EAAT1 decreased in all groups. In the amygdala, EAAT1 decreased in the CLF\u00a0+\u00a0stress and CHF. EAAT2 were decreased in the PC for stress, and increased in CHF\u00a0+\u00a0control. In the hippocampus, the EAAT2 were increased for the CLF and decreased in the CLF\u00a0+\u00a0stress. In the amygdala, there was a decrease in the EATT2 in the CLF\u00a0+\u00a0stress and CHF. These findings suggest that an anxious phenotype plus stress may induce a more pronounced DNA damage, and promote more alterations in the glutamatergic system.

However the mechanistic role of exosomes in NTE is yet to be fully understood.The present study used MCF7 cells to characterise the longevity of exosome-induced activity in the progeny of irradiated and unirradiated bystander cells. Exosomes extracted from conditioned media of irradiated and bystander progeny were added to unirradiated cells. Analysis was carried out at 1 and 20/24 population doublings following medium/exosome transfer for DNA/chromosomal damage. Results confirmed exosomes play a significant role in mediating NTE of ionising radiation (IR). This effect was remarkably persistent, observed >20 doublings post-irradiation in the progeny of bystander cells. Additionally, cell progeny undergoing a BE were themselves capable of inducing BE in other cells via exosomes they released. Furthermore we investigated the role of exosome cargo. Culture media from cells exposed to 2\u00a0Gy X-rays was subjected to ultracentrifugation and four inoculants prepared, (a) supernatants with exosomes removed, and pellets with (b) exosome proteins denatured, (c) RNA degraded, and (d) a combination of protein\u2013RNA inactivation. These were added to separate populations of unirradiated cells. The BE was partially inhibited when either exosome protein or exosome RNA were inactivated separately, whilst combined RNA\u2013protein inhibition significantly reduced or eliminated the BE. These results demonstrate that exosomes are associated with long-lived signalling of the NTE of IR. Both RNA and protein molecules of exosomes work in a synergistic manner to initiate NTE, spread these effects to na\u00efve cells, and perpetuate GI in the affected cells.",

AP endonucleases are ubiquitous enzymes required for the repair of AP sites and 3\u2032 blocking ends, but their physiological roles in multicellular organisms are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated how an AP endonuclease functions in a multicellular organism (Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans)). EXO-3 is one of the AP endonucleases in C. elegans. Using an exo-3 mutant worm, we found that deletion of the exo-3 gene caused shortened lifespan in an ung-1-dependent manner. UNG-1 is a uracil DNA glycosylase in C. elegans, and the present finding suggested that UNG-1 is the major producer of AP sites that affects lifespan, and EXO-3 contributes to longevity by completing the repair of uracil. Next we found that the exo-3 gene was abundantly expressed in the gonads, and AP sites in the gonad were efficiently repaired, suggesting that EXO-3 functioned particularly in the gonad. Deletion of the exo-3 gene resulted in a significant decrease in self-brood size. This was rescued by deficiency of NTH-1, which is a bifunctional DNA glycosylase in C. elegans that recognizes oxidative base damage. This result suggested that the major substrate of EXO-3 in the gonad was 3\u2032 blocking end generated by NTH-1, and that EXO-3 played an important role in reproduction. A contribution of EXO-3 to reproduction was also suggested by our finding here that the decrease of self-brood size of the exo-3 mutant became more marked when worms were treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and sodium bisulfite (NaHSO3).

This methodology enables one to track germline and somatic variants directly from the genome to the transcriptome in individual cells. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were treated with the powerful mutagen ethylnitrosourea (ENU) and subjected to SCTG. Interestingly, while germline variants were found to be transcribed in an allelically balanced fashion, a significantly different pattern of allelic exclusion was observed for ENU-mutant variants. These results suggest that the adverse effects of induced mutations, in contrast to germline variants, may be mitigated by allelically biased transcription.

Fifty-nine genes showed a statistically significant deregulation and were further evaluated in two epithelioid MPM cell lines (compared to MET-5A, a non-MPM cell line). Nine genes (ACSL1, CCNO, CFB, PDGFRB, SULF1, TACC1, THBS2, TIMP3, XPOT) were deregulated with statistical significance in both cell lines, 12 (ASS1, CCNB1, CDH11, COL1A1, CXADR, EIF4G1, GALNT7, ITGA4, KRT5, PTGIS, RAN, SOD1) in at least one cell line, whereas 7 (DSP, HEG1, MCM4, MSLN, NME2, NMU, TNPO2) were close but did not reach the statistical significance in any of the cell line.

Mice were administered with either MNU (90\u00a0mg/kg) or PBS and DMSO (control) at the beginning of the 1st week of the experiment. Of the 31 mice that survived the entire experimental time course, 19 (61.3%) mice developed thymic lymphomas. In addition, 52.6% (10/19) of the tumors had metastasized to the liver. We detected MSI in MNU-treated mice using a panel of 42 mutation-sensitive loci. Nineteen loci (45.2%) in six organs showed 70 MSI events. Locus D8Mit14 showed enhanced MSI compared with the other examined loci. MSI frequency in thymus was higher than in other organs. Interestingly, there was no significant difference observed between the metastatic and non-metastatic livers. The MSI frequency (4.6%, 23/(42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a012)) in the MNU-treated thymus that had never developed tumor was significantly higher than this in the thymus that had developed lymphoma (0.5%, 4/(42\u00a0\u00d7\u00a019)) (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

     "abstract": "Natural compounds hold great promise for combating antibiotic resistance, the failure to control some diseases, the emergence of new diseases and the toxicity of some contemporary medical products. Allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), which is abundant in cruciferous vegetables and mustard seeds and is commonly referred to as mustard essential oil, exhibits promising antineoplastic activity against bladder cancer, although its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of AITC activity on bladder cancer cell lines carrying a wild type (wt; RT4) or mutated (T24) TP53 gene. Morphological changes, cell cycle kinetics and CDK1, SMAD4, BAX, BCL2, ANLN and S100P gene expression were evaluated. In both cell lines, treatment with AITC inhibited cell proliferation (at 62.5, 72.5, 82.5 and 92.5\u00a0\u03bcM AITC) and induced morphological changes, including scattered and elongated cells and cellular debris. Gene expression profiles revealed increased S100P and BAX and decreased BCL2 expression in RT4 cells following AITC treatment. T24 cells displayed increased BCL2, BAX and ANLN and decreased S100P expression. No changes in SMAD4 and CDK1 expression were observed in either cell line. In conclusion, AITC inhibits cell proliferation independent of TP53 status. However, the mechanism of action of AITC differed in the two cell lines; in RT4 cells, it mainly acted via the classical BAX/BCL2 pathway, while in T24 cells, AITC modulated the activities of ANLN (related to cytokinesis) and S100P. These data confirm the role of AITC as a potential antiproliferative compound that modulates gene expression according to the tumor cell TP53 genotype.",

At early times following exposure of human cells to ionizing radiation, CtIP localized to the DSB, became hyperphosphorylated and formed foci in an ATM-dependent manner. At later times, when the initiation of resection had occurred, CtIP foci persist but CtIP is maintained in a hypophosphorylated state, which is dependent on ATM and ATR. Exposure to cycloheximide revealed that CtIP turns over at DSB sites downstream of resection. Our findings provide strong evidence that CtIP is continuously recruited to DSBs downstream of both the initiation and extension step of resection, strongly suggesting that CtIP has functions in addition to promoting the initiation of resection during HR.",

Depending on the phase, system stresses (the diverse CIN promoting factors) may lead to the very different phenotype responses. To address the contribution of chromosome instability (CIN) to phenotype changes of tumor cells, we characterized CCAs/NCCAs of HeLa and HEK293 cells, and their derivatives after genotoxic stresses (a stable plasmid transfection, ectopic expression of cancer-associated CHI3L1 gene or treatment with temozolomide) by conventional cytogenetics, copy number alterations (CNAs) by array comparative genome hybridization, and phenotype changes by cell viability and soft agar assays. Transfection of either the empty vector pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA3.1_CHI3L1 into 293 cells initiated the punctuated genome changes. In contrast, HeLa_CHI3L1 cells demonstrated the step-wise genome changes. Increased CIN correlated with lower viability of 293_pcDNA3.1 cells but higher colony formation efficiency (CFE). Artificial CHI3L1 production in 293_CHI3L1 cells increased viability and further contributed to CFE. The opposite growth characteristics of 293_CHI3L1 and HeLa_CHI3L1 cells were revealed. The effect and function of a (trans)gene can be opposite and versatile in cells with different genetic network, which is defined by genome context. Temozolomide treatment of 293_pcDNA3.1 cells intensified the stochastic punctuated genome changes and CNAs, and significantly reduced viability and CFE. In contrast, temozolomide treatment of HeLa_CHI3L1 cells promoted the step-wise genome changes, CNAs, and increased viability and CFE, which did not correlate with the ectopic CHI3L1 production. Thus, consistent coevolution of karyotypes and phenotypes was observed. CIN as a driving force of genome evolution significantly influences growth characteristics of tumor cells and should be always taken into consideration during the different experimental manipulations.",

By applying a MPS diagnostic panel targeting 129 known deafness genes, we identified a novel frameshift GATA3 mutation, c.149delT (p.Phe51LeufsX144), in a hearing-impaired family compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. The GATA3 haploinsufficiency is thought to be associated with the hypoparathyroidism, sensorineural deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome. The pathogenicity of GATA3 c.149delT was supported by its absence in the 5400 NHLBI exomes, 1000 Genomes, and the 100 normal hearing controls of the present study; the co-segregation of c.149delT heterozygosity with hearing impairment in 9 affected members of the family; as well as the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay of the mutant allele in in vitro functional studies. The phenotypes in this family appeared relatively mild, as most affected members presented no signs of hypoparathyroidism or renal abnormalities, including the proband. To our knowledge, this is the first report of genetic diagnosis of HDR syndrome before the clinical diagnosis. Genetic examination for multiple deafness genes with MPS might be helpful in identifying certain types of syndromic hearing loss such as HDR syndrome, contributing to earlier diagnosis and treatment of the affected individuals.",

Thus understanding whether the bystander effect acts as an adaptive priming element for the neighboring cells or a sensitization factor is critical in designing treatment strategies.Here we characterize the bystander effects induced by bleomycin, a DNA-damaging agent, and compartmental stress responses associated with this phenomenon. Mouse fibroblasts were treated with increasing concentrations of bleomycin and assessed for DNA damage, cell death and induction of compartmental stress response (endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic stress). Preconditioned media were used to analyze bystander damage using the same end-points. Bleomycin induced bystander response was reflected primarily in increased DNA damage. This was dependent on the concentration of bleomycin and time of media conditioning. Interestingly, we found that ROS but not NO are involved in the transmission of the bystander effect. Consistent transcriptional down-regulation of the stress response factors tested (i.e. BiP, mtHsp60, Hsp70) occurred in the direct effect indicating that bleomycin might induce an arrest of transcription correlated with decreased survival. We observed the opposite trend in the bystander effect, with specific stress markers appearing increased and correlated with increased survival. These data shed new light on the potential role of stress pathways activation in bystander effects and their putative impact on the pro-survival pro-death balance.",

     "abstract": "Ionizing radiation produces various types of DNA lesions, such as base damage, single-strand breaks, double-strand breaks (DSBs), and DNA\u2013protein cross-links (DPCs). Of these, DSBs are the most critical lesions underlying the lethal effects of ionizing radiation. With DPCs, proteins covalently trapped in DNA constitute strong roadblocks to replication and transcription machineries, and hence can be lethal to cells. The formation of DPCs by ionizing radiation is promoted in the absence of oxygen, whereas that of DSBs is retarded. Accordingly, the contribution of DPCs to the lethal events in irradiated cells may not be negligible for hypoxic cells, such as those present in tumors. However, the role of DPCs in the lethal effects of ionizing radiation remains largely equivocal. In the present study, normoxic and hypoxic mouse tumors were irradiated with X-rays [low linear energy transfer (LET) radiation] and carbon (C)-ion beams (high LET radiation), and the resulting induction of DPCs and DSBs and their removal from the genome were analyzed. X-rays and C-ion beams produced more DPCs in hypoxic tumors than in normoxic tumors. Interestingly, the yield of DPCs was slightly but statistically significantly greater (1.3- to 1.5-fold) for C-ion beams than for X-rays. Both X-rays and C-ion beams generated two types of DPC that differed according to their rate of removal from the genome. This was also the case for DSBs.

Improper higher-order chromatin organization at the chromosome ends can give rise to telomeric recombination and genomic instability. We report the development of an assay to quantify differences in the condensation of telomeric chromatin, thereby offering new opportunities to study telomere biology and stability. We have combined a DNA nuclease digestion with a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay of telomeric DNA, which we term the Telomere Chromatin Condensation Assay (TCCA). By quantifying the relative quantities of telomeric DNA that are progressively digested with the exonuclease Bal 31 the method can discriminate between different levels of telomeric chromatin condensation. The structural chromatin packaging at telomeres shielded against exonuclease digestion delivered an estimate, which we term Chromatin Protection Factor (CPF) that ranged from 1.7 to 2.3 fold greater than that present in unpacked DNA. The CPF was significantly decreased when cell cultures were incubated with the DNA hypomethylating agent 5-azacytidine, demonstrating the ability of the TCCA assay to discriminate between packaging levels of telomeric DNA.",

     "abstract": "Human malaria is an important parasitic infection responsible for a significant number of deaths worldwide, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions. The recent scenario has worsened mainly because of the emergence of drug-resistant malaria parasites having the potential to spread across the world. Drug-resistant parasites possess a defective mismatch repair (MMR); therefore, it is essential to explore its mechanism in detail to determine the underlying cause. Recently, artemisinin-resistant parasites have been reported to exhibit nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes involved in MMR pathways such as MutL homolog (MLH) and UvrD. Plasmodium falciparum MLH is an endonuclease required to restore the defective MMR in drug-resistant W2 strain of P. falciparum. Although the role of helicases in eukaryotic MMR has been questioned, the identification and characterization of the UvrD helicase and their cross-talk with MLH in P. falciparum suggests the possible involvement of UvrD in MMR. A comparative genome-wide analysis revealed the presence of the UvrD helicase in Plasmodium species, while it is absent in human host. Therefore, PfUvrD may emerge as a suitable drug target to control malaria. This review study is focused on recent developments in MMR biochemistry, emerging importance of the UvrD helicase, possibility of its involvement in MMR and the emerging cross-talk between MMR components and drug resistance in malaria parasite.",

Evidence showed that tumor suppressor p53 plays an important role in regulating the generation of cellular ROS, either by reducing oxidative stress under physiological and mildly stressed conditions, or by promoting oxidative stress under highly stressed conditions. In this report we characterized the effect of oxidative stress on the induction of micronuclei, especially the subclass marked by pan-staining of \u03b3-H2AX or MN-\u03b3-H2AX (+). We found that MN-\u03b3-H2AX (+) were more responsive to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) than the MN-\u03b3-H2AX (\u2212). In human and mouse cells that are deficient in p53, the frequency of MN-\u03b3-H2AX (+) is significantly elevated, but can be attenuated by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Depletion of p53-regulated antioxidant gene SESN1 by RNA interference also resulted in an elevation of MN-\u03b3-H2AX (+). Furthermore, we found that in cells that were depleted of p400 by RNAi, and therefore were experiencing increased ROS, the frequency of MN-\u03b3-H2AX (+), but not that of MN-\u03b3-H2AX (\u2212), was significantly induced. We further demonstrated that the induction of MN-\u03b3-H2AX (+) by replication stress can also be attenuated by NAC, and that H2O2 also leads to increased phosphorylation of Chk1 and Rad17 that mimics replication stress, suggesting that replication stress and oxidative stress are intertwined and may reinforce each other in driving genomic instability. Our findings illustrate the importance of p53-regulated redox level in the maintenance of genomic stability.",

Post-translational modifications to histones have recently attracted attention due to their link with cancer. In the present study, we examined histone modifications following a treatment with FA. FA significantly phosphorylated histone H3 at serine 10 (H3S10), and at serine 28 (H3S28), the time-course of which was similar to the phosphorylation of H2AX at serine 139 (\u03b3-H2AX), a marker of DNA double strand breaks. The temporal deacetylation of H3 was observed due to the reaction of FA with the lysine residues of histones. The phosphorylation mechanism was then analyzed by focusing on H3S10. The nuclear distribution of the phosphorylation of H3S10 and \u03b3-H2AX did not overlap, and the phosphorylation of H3S10 could not be suppressed with an inhibitor of ATM/ATR, suggesting that the phosphorylation of H3S10 was independent of the DNA damage response. ERK and JNK in the MAPK pathways were phosphorylated by the treatment with FA, in which the JNK pathway was the main target for phosphorylation. The phosphorylation of H3S10 increased at the promoter regions of c-fos and c-jun, indicating a relationship between FA-induced tumor promotion activity and phosphorylation of H3S10. These results suggested that FA both initiates and promotes cancer, as judged by an analysis of histone modifications.",

Groups of 3\u20135 mice were randomly assigned to 10 groups, each receiving either a different activity of 18F-FDG: 0\u201337\u00a0MBq or whole body irradiated with corresponding doses of 0\u2013300\u00a0mGy X-rays. Blood samples were collected at 24\u00a0h and at 43\u00a0h for reticulocyte micronucleus assays and QPCR analysis of gene expression in peripheral blood leukocytes. Blood and bone marrow dose estimates were calculated from injected activities of 18F-FDG and were based on a recommended ICRP model. Doses to the bone marrow corresponding to 33.43\u00a0mGy and above for internal 18F-FDG exposure and to 25\u00a0mGy and above for external X-ray exposure, showed significant increases in radiation-induced MN-RET formation relative to controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Regression analysis showed that both types of exposure produced a linear response with linear regression analysis giving R2 of 0.992 and 0.999 for respectively internal and external exposure. No significant difference between the two data sets was found with a P-value of 0.493. In vivo gene expression dose\u2013responses at 24\u00a0h for Bbc3 and Cdkn1 were similar for 18F-FDG and X-ray exposures, with significant modifications occurring for doses over 300\u00a0mGy for Bbc3 and at the lower dose of 150\u00a0mGy for Cdkn1a.

Chromosome damages in benzene-exposed workers and rodents have been observed, and in their urine sulfo- and glucuronide-conjugates of phenol and hydroquinone were present. Yet, direct evidence for human CYP2E1-activated mutagenicity of benzene and the exact significance of phase II metabolism for inactivating benzene metabolites are still missing. In the present study, benzene and its oxidized metabolites (phenol, hydroquinone, catechol, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene and 1,4-benzoquinone) were investigated for induction of micronuclei in a V79-derived cell line genetically engineered for expression of both human CYP2E1 and human sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1 (indicated by active micronuclei induction by 1-hydroxymethylpyrene). The results demonstrated concentration-dependent induction of micronuclei by benzene and phenol, though with lower potency or efficacy than the other metabolites. Inhibition of CYP2E1 by 1-aminobenzotriazole did not change the effect of benzoquinone, but completely abolished that of benzene and phenol, and attenuated that of the other compounds. Moreover, inhibition of SULT1A1 by pentachlorophenol potentiated the effects of benzene, hydroquinone, catechol and trihydroxybenzene. Ascorbic acid, a reducing and free radical-scavenging agent, significantly lowered the effects of hydroquinone, catechol, trihydroxybenzene as well as N-nitrosodimethylamine (a known CYP2E1-dependent promutagen), with that of benzoquinone unaffected. These results suggest that in addition to activating benzene and phenol, human CYP2E1 may further convert hydroquinone, catechol and trihydroxybenzene to more genotoxic metabolites, and sulfo-conjugation of the multi-hydroxylated metabolites of benzene by human SULT1A1 may represent an important detoxifying pathway.",

In this study, we improved the detection of dicentrics and all unstable chromosomal aberrations (CA) leading to a significant reevaluation of the dose\u2013effect curve and developed an automated approach following TC staining.Blood samples from 16 healthy donors were exposed to 137Cs at 8 doses from 0.1 to 6\u00a0Gy. CA were manually and automatically scored following uniform (Giemsa) or TC staining. The detection of centromeric regions and telomeric sequences using PNA probes allowed the detection of all unstable CA: dicentrics, centric and acentric rings, and all acentric fragments (with 2, 4 or no telomeres) leading to the precise quantification of estimated double strand breaks (DSB).Manual scoring following TC staining revealed a significantly higher frequency of dicentrics (p\u00a0<\u00a010\u22123) (up to 30%) and estimated DSB (p\u00a0<\u00a010\u22124) compared to uniform staining due to improved detection of dicentrics with centromeres juxtaposed with other centromeres or telomeres. This improvement permitted the development of the software, TCScore, that detected 95% of manually scored dicentrics compared to 50% for the best currently available software (DCScore\u2122).The use of TC staining has permitted a reevaluation of the dose\u2013response curve and the highly efficient automation of the scoring process, marking a new step in the management and follow-up of populations exposed to genotoxic agents including ionizing radiation.",

However, many mammalian cell lines, when acutely irradiated in G2 at doses \u22640.3\u00a0Gy, show hyper-radiosensitivity (HRS) as measured by reduced clonogenic cell survival, thereby indicating greater cell lethality than is predicted by extrapolation from high-dose responses. We therefore hypothesized that the cytogenetic response in G2 cells to low doses would also be steeper than predicted by LQ extrapolation from high doses. We tested our hypothesis by exposing four normal human lymphoblastoid cell lines to 0\u2013400\u00a0cGy of Cobalt-60 gamma radiation. The cytokinesis block micronucleus assay was used to determine the frequencies of micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridges. To characterize the dependence of the cytogenetic damage on dose, univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to compare the responses in the low- (HRS) and high-dose response regions. Our data indicate that the slope of the response for all four cell lines at \u226420\u00a0cGy during G2 is greater than predicted by an LQ extrapolation from the high-dose responses for both micronuclei and bridges. These results suggest that the biological consequences of low-dose exposures could be underestimated and may not provide accurate risk assessments following such exposures.",

     "abstract": "The lacI gene of Escherichia coli has been a highly useful target for studies of mutagenesis, particularly for analysis of the specificity (spectrum) of mutations generated under a variety of conditions and in various genetic backgrounds. The gene encodes the repressor of the lac operon, and lacI-defective mutants displaying constitutive expression of the operon are readily selected. DNA sequencing of the lacI mutants has often been confined to the N-terminal region of the protein, as it presents a conveniently short target with a high density of detectably mutable sites. Mutants in this region are easily selected due to their dominance in a genetic complementation test (lacId mutants). A potential complication in these studies is that constitutive expression of lac may also arise due to mutations in the lac operator (lacO mutants). Under some conditions, for example when analyzing spontaneous mutations, lacO mutants can comprise a very high fraction of the constitutive mutants due to a strong base-substitution hotspot in the lac operator. Such mutational hot spots diminish the return of the sequencing effort and do not yield significant new information. For this reason, a procedure to eliminate the lacO mutants prior to DNA sequencing is desirable. Here, we report a simple method that allows screening out of lacO mutants. This method is based on the lack of resistance of lacO mutants to kanamycin under conditions when the kan gene is expressed from a plasmid under control of the lac promoter-operator (lacPO). We show data validating the new approach with sets of known lacId and lacO mutants, and further apply it to the generation of a new collection of spontaneous mutations, where lacO mutants have historically been a significant contributor.",

Nevertheless, sSNPs in serine/arginine-rich (SR) and splice-site (SS) exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) or in exonic CpG methylation targets, could be decisive for splicing, particularly in aging-related conditions, where mis-splicing is frequently observed.We presently identified 33 genes T2D-related and 28 related to neurodegenerative diseases, by investigating the impact of the corresponding coding sSNPs on splicing and using gene ontology data and computational tools. Potentially critical (prominent) sSNPs comply with the following criteria: changing the splicing potential of prominent SR-ESEs or of significant SS-ESEs by >1.5 units (\u0394score), or formation/deletion of ESEs with maximum splicing score. We also noted the formation/disruption of CpGs (tentative methylation sites of epigenetic sSNPs). All disease association studies involving sSNPs are also reported. Only 21/670 coding SNPs, mostly epigenetic, reported in 33 T2D-related genes, were found to be prominent coding synonymous. No prominent sSNPs have been recorded in three key T2D-related genes (GCGR, PPARGC1A, IGF1). Similarly, 20/366 coding synonymous were identified in ND related genes, mostly epigenetic. Meta-analysis showed that 17 of the above prominent sSNPs were previously investigated in association with various pathological conditions. Three out of four sSNPs (all epigenetic) were associated with T2D and one with NDs (branch site sSNP). Five were associated with other or related pathological conditions. None of the four sSNPs introducing new ESEs was found to be disease-associated. sSNPs introducing smaller \u0394score changes (<1.5) in key proteins (INSR, IRS1, DISC1) were also correlated to pathological conditions.This data reveals that genetic variation in splicing-regulatory and particularly CpG sites might be related to disease predisposition and that in-silico analysis is useful for identifying sSNPs, which might be falsely identified as silent or synonymous.",

In this study, we analyzed global gene expression changes caused by the extractable organic matters (EOMs) from respirable airborne particles <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm (PM2.5), collected at 3 localities from heavily polluted areas of the Czech Republic and a control locality with low pollution levels, in human lung epithelial A549 cells.Although the sampled localities differed in both extent and sources of air pollution, EOMs did not induce substantially different gene expression profiles. The number of transcripts deregulated in A549 cells treated with the lowest EOM concentration (10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) ranged from 65 to 85 in 4 sampling localities compared to the number of transcripts deregulated after 30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 60\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of EOMs, which ranged from 90 to 109, and from 149 to 452, respectively. We found numerous commonly deregulated genes and pathways related to activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and metabolism of xenobiotics and endogenous compounds. We further identified deregulation of expression of the genes involved in pro-inflammatory processes, oxidative stress response and in cancer and developmental pathways, such as TGF-\u03b2 and Wnt signaling pathways. No cell cycle arrest, DNA repair or pro-apoptotic responses were identified at the transcriptional level after the treatment of A549 cells with EOMs.In conclusion, numerous processes and pathways deregulated in response to EOMs suggest a significant role of activated AhR. Interestingly, we did not observe substantial gene expression changes related to DNA damage response, possibly due to the antagonistic effect of non-genotoxic EOM components. Moreover, a comparison of EOM effects with other available data on modulation of global gene expression suggests possible overlap among the effects of PM2.5, EOMs and various types of AhR agonists.",

In this work we found a relationship between phosphorylation of carboxy (C)-terminal STT motif of PTEN and DNA damage response. Ectopic expression of C-terminal phospho-mutants of PTEN, in PTEN deficient human glioblastoma cells, U87MG, resulted in reduced viability and DNA repair after etoposide induced DNA damage compared to cells expressing wild type PTEN. Also, after etoposide treatment phosphorylation of PTEN increased at C-terminal serine 380 and threonine 382/383 residues in PTEN positive HEK293T cells and wild type PTEN transfected U87MG cells. One-step further, DNA damage induced phosphorylation of PTEN was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of total PTEN from cellular extract followed by immunobloting with phospho-specific PTEN antibodies. Additionally, phospho-PTEN translocated to nucleus after etoposide treatment as revealed by indirect immunolabeling. Further, phosphorylation dependent nuclear foci formation of PTEN was observed after ionizing radiation or etoposide treatment which colocalized with \u03b3H2AX. Additionally, etoposide induced \u03b3H2AX, Mre11 and Ku70 foci persisted for a longer period of times in U87MG cells after ectopic expression of PTEN C-terminal phospho-mutant constructs compared to wild type PTEN expressing cells. Thus, our findings strongly suggest that DNA damage induced phosphorylation of C-terminal STT motif of PTEN is necessary for DNA repair.",

Effectiveness of docetaxel was examined in vivo in several mouse models engrafted either subcutaneously or intravenously with several types of cell lines. The effects of 147\u20135040\u00a0mg/L of docetaxel in treatments of different regimens in those xenograft growths were monitored and quantified to identify energy of those doses as described before in earlier studies. Mock processes were performed on untreated groups of mice for controls. Docetaxel had significant influence on all sizes of treated tumors compared to the control animals. The longer the induced tumor doubling time intraday to more than half the time period from the start of therapy to the time of delivery of the dose, the higher the energy of docetaxel doses and hence the effectiveness of the treatment and vice versa. The energy yield by drug doses in optimal standard regimens was perfectly power correlated (r\u00a0=\u00a01) with the drug dose. An efficient dose-energy model with a perfect fit (R2\u00a0=\u00a01) estimating the energy yield by docetaxel doses in optimal standard regimens has been established to administer the personalized dose. Administration of docetaxel doses should be patient-specific and sufficient for the suggested regimen. Time periods from the start of therapy to the time of dose delivery of the efficient regimen are shorter than twice the tumor doubling time intraday on time of dose delivery. Patients with tumors of lower mitotic index may particularly benefit more from optimal standard regimens, whereas metronomic regimens would be more efficient in patients with tumors of higher mitotic index that need lower doses of docetaxel.",

The DNA DSB is a potentially carcinogenic lesion for human cells. Thus, we aimed to evaluate whether the level of oxidative stress was increased in peripheral blood lymphocytes of a group of affected adolescents.In 35 T1DM adolescents and 19 healthy controls we assessed: (1) spontaneous and H2O2-induced oxidation of cell membrane using a fluorescence lipid probe; (2) spontaneous and LPS-induced expression of iNOS protein and indirect NO determination via cytofluorimetric analysis of O2\u2212; (3) immunofluorescent detection of the basal level of histone H2AX phosphorylation (\u03b3-H2AX foci), a well-validated marker of DNA DSB.In T1DM, the frequencies of oxidized cells, both spontaneous and H2O2-induced (47.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02) were significantly higher than in controls (35.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03). Patients showed, in general, both a reduced iNOS expression and production of NO.

This also indicates that oxidative stress can affect several tissues in the body. However, although the observed DNA damage is a clear indication that the proper DNA repair mechanisms are activated, the risk for young T1DM subjects of developing not only cardiovascular complications but also some type of cancer cannot be ruled out. In this view, females, probably due to hormonal imbalance typical of adolescence, might represent a more susceptible population.",

In the micronucleus assay, micronuclei (MNi) were found in peripheral lymphocytes exposed to all three HAAs and catalase and BHA were in general, able to reduce MNi induction, suggesting oxygen radicals play a role in both assays.These observations are of concern to public health since both human somatic and germ cells show similar genotoxic responses.",

In this study, we investigated the biochemical and antigenotoxic effects of acerola juice in different stages of maturity (unripe, ripe and industrial) and its main pharmacologically active components vitamin C and rutin, when given as food supplements to obese mice. Initial HPLC analyses confirmed that all types of acerola juice contained high levels of vitamin C and rutin. DPPH tests quantified the antioxidant properties of these juices and revealed higher antioxidant potentials compared to pure vitamin C and rutin. In an animal test series, groups of male mice were fed on a standard (STA) or a cafeteria (CAF) diet for 13 weeks. The latter consisted of a variety of supermarket products, rich in sugar and fat. This CAF diet increased the feed efficiency, but also induced glucose intolerance and DNA damage, which was established by comet assays and micronucleus tests. Subsequently, CAF mice were given additional diet supplements (acerola juice, vitamin C or rutin) for one month and the effects on bone marrow, peripheral blood, liver, kidney, and brain were examined. The results indicated that food supplementation with ripe or industrial acerola juice led to a partial reversal of the diet-induced DNA damage in the blood, kidney, liver and bone marrow. For unripe acerola juice food supplementation, beneficial effects were observed in blood, kidney and bone marrow. Food supplementation with vitamin C led to decreased DNA damage in kidney and liver, whereas rutin supplementation led to decreased DNA damage in all tissue samples observed. These results suggest that acerola juice helps to reduce oxidative stress and may decrease genotoxicity under obesogenic conditions.",

It is critically important in the prevention of DNA mutations derived from 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), which are the major lesions resulting from guanine oxidation. MutY has been described as a DNA repair enzyme in the GO system responsible for removing adenine residues misincorporated in 8-oxoG:A mispairs, avoiding G:C to T:A mutations. Further studies have shown that this enzyme binds to other mispairs, interacts with several enzymes, avoids different transversions/transitions in DNA, and is involved in different repair pathways. Additional activities have been reported for MutY, such as the repair of replication errors in newly synthesized DNA strands through its glycosylase activity. Moreover, MutY is a highly conserved enzyme present in several prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. MutY defects are associated with a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome termed MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP). Here, we have reviewed the roles of MutY in the repair of mispaired bases in DNA as well as its activities beyond the GO system.",

     "abstract": "Efficient and correct repair of DNA double-strand break (DSB) is critical for cell survival. Defects in the DNA repair may lead to cell death, genomic instability and development of cancer. The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) is an essential component of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) which is the major DSB repair pathway in mammalian cells. In the present study, by using siRNA against DNA-PKcs in four human cell lines, we examined how low levels of DNA-PKcs affected cellular response to ionizing radiation. Decrease of DNA-PKcs levels by 80\u201395%, induced by siRNA treatment, lead to extreme radiosensitivity, similar to that seen in cells completely lacking DNA-PKcs and low levels of DNA-PKcs promoted cell accumulation in G2/M phase after irradiation and blocked progression of mitosis. Surprisingly, low levels of DNA-PKcs did not affect the repair capacity and the removal of 53BP1 or \u03b3-H2AX foci and rejoining of DSB appeared normal. This was in strong contrast to cells completely lacking DNA-PKcs and cells treated with the DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441, in which DSB repair were severely compromised. This suggests that there are different mechanisms by which loss of DNA-PKcs functions can sensitize cells to ionizing radiation. Further, foci of phosphorylated DNA-PKcs (T2609 and S2056) co-localized with DSB and this was independent of the amount of DNA-PKcs but foci of DNA-PKcs was only seen in siRNA-treated cells. Our study emphasizes on the critical role of DNA-PKcs for maintaining survival after radiation exposure which is uncoupled from its essential function in DSB repair. This could have implications for the development of therapeutic strategies aiming to radiosensitize tumors by affecting the DNA-PKcs function.",

     "abstract": "Nibrin (NBN) is a member of a DNA repair complex together with MRE11 and RAD50. The complex is associated particularly with the repair of DNA double strand breaks and with the regulation of cell cycle check points. Hypomorphic mutation of components of the complex leads to human disorders characterised by radiosensitivity and increased tumour occurrence, particularly of the lymphatic system. We have examined here the relationship between DNA damage, mutation frequency and mutation spectrum in vitro and in vivo in mouse models carrying NBN mutations and a lacZ reporter plasmid. We find that NBN mutation leads to increased spontaneous DNA damage in fibroblasts in vitro and high basal mutation rates in lymphatic tissue of mice in vivo. The characteristic mutation spectrum is dominated by single base transitions rather than the deletions and complex rearrangements expected after abortive repair of DNA double strand breaks. We conclude that in the absence of wild type nibrin, the repair of spontaneous errors, presumably arising during DNA replication, makes a major contribution to the basal mutation rate. This applies also to cells heterozygous for an NBN null mutation. Mutation frequencies after irradiation in vivo were not increased in mice with nibrin mutations as might have been expected considering the radiosensitivity of NBS patient cells in vitro. Evidently apoptosis is efficient, even in the absence of wild type nibrin.",

Cytogenetic assays with phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated cultured T lymphocytes are also frequently performed in human biomonitoring. Cytogenetic effects (micronuclei, chromosome aberrations, sister chromatid exchanges) may be induced in vivo but also occur ex vivo during the cultivation of lymphocytes as a consequence of DNA damage present in lymphocytes at the time of sampling. To better understand whether DNA damage measured by the comet assay in PBMC is representative for DNA damage in T cells, we comparatively investigated DNA damage and its repair in PBMC and T cells obtained by immunomagnetic cell sorting. PBMC cultures and T cell cultures were exposed to mutagens with different modes of genotoxic action and DNA damage was measured by the comet assay after the end of a 2\u00a0h exposure and after 18\u00a0h post-incubation. The mutagens tested were methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), (\u00b1)-anti-B[a]P-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide (BPDE), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), styrene oxide and potassium bromate. MMS and potassium bromate were also tested by the modified comet assay with formamido pyrimidine glycosylase (FPG) protein. The results indicate that the mutagens tested induce DNA damage in PBMC and T cells in the same range of concentrations and removal of induced DNA lesions occurs to a comparable extent. Based on these results, we conclude that the comet assay with PBMC is suited to predict DNA damage and its removal in T cells.",

     "abstract": "mtDNA mutations are common in human cancers and are thought to contribute to the process of neoplasia. We examined the role of mtDNA mutations in skin cancer by generating fibroblast cybrids harboring a mutation in the gene encoding the mitochondrial tRNA for arginine. This somatic mutation (9821insA) was previously reported in UV-induced hyperkeratotic skin tumors in hairless mice and confers specific tumorigenic phenotypes to mutant cybrids. Microarray analysis revealed and RT-PCR along with Western blot analysis confirmed the up-regulation of CCL20 and its receptor CCR6 in mtBALB haplotype containing the mt-Tr 9821insA allele compared to wild type mtB6 haplotype. Based on reported role of CCL20 in cancer progression we examined whether the hyper-proliferation and enhanced motility of mtBALB haplotype would be associated with CCL20 levels. Treatment of both genotypes with recombinant CCL20 (rmCCL20) resulted in enhanced growth and motility of mtB6 cybrids. Furthermore, the acquired somatic alteration increased the in vivo tumor growth of mtBALB cybrids through the up-regulation of CCL20 since neutralizing antibody significantly decreased in vivo tumor growth of these cells; and tumors from anti-CCL20 treated mice injected with mtBALB cybrids showed significantly decreased CCL20 levels. When rmCCL20 or mtBALB cybrids were used as chemotactic stimuli, mtB6 cybrids showed increased motility while anti-CCL20 antibody decreased the migration and in vivo tumor growth of mtBALB cybrids.

This abnormal situation induces changes in the cell cycle, DNA damage, chromosomal and mitotic aberrations, all of which may be related to carcinogenesis. In order to further investigate the mechanistic basis of these effects, HepG2 cells were treated with 3\u00a0\u03bcM B[a]P for various time periods, followed by further incubation in the absence of B[a]P for up to 192\u00a0h. B[a]P treatment led initially to S-phase arrest followed by recovery and subsequent induction of G2/M arrest, indicating activation of the corresponding DNA damage checkpoints. Immunofluorescence-based studies revealed accumulation of B[a]P-induced DNA adducts and chromosomal damage which persisted beyond mitosis and entry into a new cycle, thus giving rise to a new round of activation of the S-phase checkpoint. Prolonged further cultivation of the cells in the absence of B[a]P resulted in high frequencies of various abnormal mitotic events. Abrogation of the B[a]P-induced S-phase arrest by the Chk1 inhibitor UCN-01 triggered a strong apoptotic response but also dramatically decreased the frequency of mitotic abnormalities in the surviving cells, suggesting that events occurring during S-phase arrest contribute to the formation of delayed mitotic damage. Overall, our data demonstrate that, although S-phase arrest serves as a mechanism by which the cells reduce their load of genetic damage, its prolonged activation may also have a negative impact on the balance between cell death and heritable genetic damage.",

However, there is evidence to suggest that MutL is not only the linker connecting the functions of MutS and MutH in MMR, but that it also participates in other repair systems, such as Very Short Patch (VSP), Base Excision (BER) and Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER). This study set out to identify the most highly conserved amino acid sequence motifs in MutL proteins.We analyzed 208 MutL amino acid sequences of 199 representative prokaryotic species belonging to 28 classes of bacteria and archaea. The analysis revealed 16 conserved motifs situated in the ATPase and endonuclease domains, as well as within the disordered loop, and in the MutL regions interacting with the \u03b2 clamp of DNA polymerase III. The conserved sequence motifs thus determined constitute a structural definition of MutL and they may be used in site-directed mutagenesis studies. We found conserved residues within the potential regions where binding with MutS occurs. However, the existing data does not provide clues as to the possible sites of MutL interactions with the proteins involved in other DNA repair systems such as NER, BER and VSP.We determined the 57 most highly conserved amino acid residues, including 43 which were identical in all the sequences analyzed. The greater part of the most predominantly conserved amino acid residues identified in MutL are identical to the corresponding residues reported as mutational hot-spots in one of its human homologues, MLH1, but not in the other, PMS2.This is the first study to present the conserved sequence motifs of MutL widespread in bacteria and archaea and the classification of MutLs into five groups distinguished on the basis of differences in the C-terminal region. Our analysis is of use in better understanding MutL functions.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we report the effects of deleting the principal mitotic cyclin, Clb2, in different repair deficient contexts on sensitivity to the alkylating DNA damaging agent, methyl methanesulphonate (MMS). A yeast clb2 mutant is sensitive to MMS and displays synergistic effect when combined with inactivation of numerous genes involved in DNA recombination and replication. In contrast, clb2 has basically no additional effect with deletion of the RecQ helicase SGS1, the exonuclease EXO1 and the protein kinase RAD53 suggesting that Clb2 functions in these pathways. In addition, clb2 increases the viability of the mec1 kinase deficient mutant, suggesting Mec1 inhibits a deleterious Clb2 activity. Interestingly, we found that the rescue by EXO1 deletion of rad53K227 mutant, deficient in checkpoint activation, requires Sgs1, suggesting a role for Rad53, independent of its checkpoint function, in regulating an ordered recruitment of Sgs1 and Exo1 to fork structure. Overall, our data suggest that Clb2 affects recombinant structure of replication fork blocked by alkylating DNA damage at numerous steps and could regulate Sgs1 and Exo1 activity. In addition, we found novel requirement of Sgs1 DNA helicase and Exonuclease 1 when replication forks breaks in the presence of alkylation damage. Models for the functional interactions of mitotic cyclin Clb2, Sgs1 and Exo1 with replication fork stabilization are proposed.",

The removal of 3\u2032-phosphoglycolate to give 3\u2032-OH ends is a very important step in the DNA repair of these lesions. In this study, next-generation DNA sequencing was utilised to investigate the repair of these 3\u2032-phosphoglycolate termini at the transcription start sites (TSSs) of genes in HeLa cells. The 143,600 identified human TSSs in HeLa cells comprised 82,596 non-transcribed genes and 61,004 transcribed genes; and the transcribed genes were divided into quintiles of 12,201 genes comprising the top 20%, 20\u201340%, 40\u201360%, 60\u201380%, 80\u2013100% of expressed genes. Repair of bleomycin-induced 3\u2032-phosphoglycolate termini was enhanced at actively transcribed genes. The top 20% and 20\u201340% quintiles had a very similar level of enhanced repair, the 40\u201360% quintile was intermediate, while the 60\u201380% and 80\u2013100% quintiles were close to the low level of enhancement found in non-transcribed genes. There were also interesting differences regarding bleomycin repair on the sense and antisense strands of DNA at TSSs. The sense strand had highly enhanced repair between 0 and 250\u00a0bp relative to the TSS, while for the antisense strand highly enhanced repair was between 150 and 450\u00a0bp. Repair of DNA damage is a major mechanism of resistance to anti-tumour drugs and this study provides an insight into this process in human tumour cells.",

Activated type 2 helper T cells secrete a panel of cytokines, including IL-13, a central immune regulator of many of the hallmark type 2 disease characteristics found in asthma. IL-13 has been directly implicated as a potent stimulator of asthma induced airway remodeling. Although IL-13 is known to play a major role in the development and persistence of asthma, the complex combination of environmental and genetic origin of the disease obfuscate the solitary role of IL-13 in the disease. We therefore, used a genetically modified mouse model which conditionally overexpresses IL-13 in the lungs to study the independent role of IL-13 in the progression of asthma. Our results demonstrate IL-13 is associated with a systemic induction of genotoxic parameters such as oxidative DNA damage, single and double DNA strand breaks, micronucleus formation, and protein nitration. Furthermore we show that inflammation induced genotoxicity found in asthma extends beyond the primary site of the lung to circulating leukocytes and erythroblasts in the bone marrow eliciting systemic effects driven by IL-13 over-expression.",

The aims of this study are to observe the cytotoxicity of Ag NPs and ZnO NPs to human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cells in vitro, and to discover the toxicity mechanism of nanoparticles on Caco-2 cells. Caco-2 cells were exposed to 10, 25, 50, 100, 200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL of Ag NPs and ZnO NPs (90\u00a0nm). AO/EB double staining was used to characterize the morphology of the treated cells. The cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to detect the proliferation of the cells. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH) assay were used to explore the oxidative damage of Caco-2 cells. The results showed that Ag NPs and ZnO NPs (0\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcg/mL) had highly significant effect on the Caco-2 cells activity. ZnO NPs exerted higher cytotoxicity than Ag NPs in the same concentration range. ZnO NPs have dose-depended toxicity. The LD50 of ZnO NPs in Caco-2 cells is 0.431\u00a0mg/L. Significant depletion of SOD level, variation in GSH level and release of ROS in cells treated by ZnO NPs were observed, which suggests that cytotoxicity of ZnO NPs in intestine cells might be mediated through cellular oxidative stress. While Caco-2 cells treated with Ag NPs at all experimental concentrations showed no cellular oxidative damage. Moreover, the cells\u2019 antioxidant capacity increased, and reached the highest level when the concentration of Ag NPs was 50\u00a0\u03bcg/mL.

     "abstract": "Overproduction of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) has been reported to be implicated in carcinogenesis. The intracellular level of PGE2 is maintained not only by its biosynthesis, but also by inactivation/degradation. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) is the key enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oncogenic PGE2 to a biologically inactive keto metabolite. In the present study, we demonstrate that 15-deoxy-\u039412,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2), one of the terminal products of cyclooxygenase-2, updregulates the expression and the activity of 15-PGDH in human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. By using deletion constructs of the 15-PGDH promoter, we have found that E-twenty six (Ets) is the most essential determinant for 15-PGDH induction. 15d-PGJ2 induced phosphorylation of Elk-1, one of Ets transcription factor family members, in the nucleus. Knockdown of Elk-1 abolished the ability of 15d-PGJ2 to upregulate 15-PGDH expression. Furthermore, 15d-PGJ2-mediated activation of Elk-1 was found to be dependent on activation of extracellular-signal related kinase (ERK) 1/2. Treatment of U0126, a pharmacological inhibitor of MEK1/2-ERK, abolished phosphorylation and DNA binding of Elk-1 as well as 15-PGDH induction in 15d-PGJ2-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, 15d-PGJ2 generated reactive oxygen species (ROS), which contribute to the expression of 15-PGDH as well as phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and Elk-1. 15d-PGJ2 inhibited the migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, which was attenuated by transient transfection with 15-PGDH siRNA. Taken together, these findings suggest that 15d-PGJ2 induces the expression of 15-PGDH through ROS-mediated activation of ERK1/2 and subsequently Elk-1 in the MDA-MB-231 cells, which may contribute to tumor suppressive activity of this cyclopentenone prostaglandin.",

     "abstract": "Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, evasion of cell death and the ability to invade and disrupt vital tissue function. The classic model of carcinogenesis describes successive clonal expansion driven by the accumulation of mutations that eliminate restraints on proliferation and cell survival. It has been proposed that during cancer's development, the loose-knit colonies of only partially differentiated cells display some unicellular/prokaryotic behavior reminiscent of robust ancient life forms. The seeming \u201cregression\u201d of cancer cells involves changes within metabolic machinery and survival strategies. This atavist change in physiology enables cancer cells to behave as selfish \u201cneo-endo-parasites\u201d that exploit the tumor stromal cells in order to extract nutrients from the surrounding microenvironment. In this framework, it is conceivable that anti-parasitic compounds might serve as promising anticancer drugs. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), a thiazolide compound, has shown antimicrobial properties against anaerobic bacteria, as well as against helminths and protozoa. NTZ has also been successfully used to promote Hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination by improving interferon signaling and promoting autophagy. More compelling however are the potential anti-cancer properties that have been observed. NTZ seems to be able to interfere with crucial metabolic and pro-death signaling such as drug detoxification, unfolded protein response (UPR), autophagy, anti-cytokine activities and c-Myc inhibition. In this article, we review the ability of NTZ to interfere with integrated survival mechanisms of cancer cells and propose that this compound might be a potent addition to the current chemotherapeutic strategy against cancer.",

Preventing or inhibiting metastasis-related events through non-toxic agents could be a useful approach for lowering high mortality among PCA patients. We have earlier reported that natural flavonoid silibinin possesses strong anti-metastatic efficacy against PCA however, mechanism/s of its action still remains largely unknown. One of the major events during metastasis is the replacement of cell\u2013cell interaction with integrins-based cell\u2013matrix interaction that controls motility, invasiveness and survival of cancer cells. Accordingly, here we examined silibinin effect on advanced human PCA PC3 cells\u2019 interaction with extracellular matrix component fibronectin. Silibinin (50\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM) treatment significantly decreased the fibronectin (5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml)-induced motile morphology via targeting actin cytoskeleton organization in PC3 cells. Silibinin also decreased the fibronectin-induced cell proliferation and motility but significantly increased cell death in PC3 cells. Silibinin also inhibited the PC3 cells invasiveness in Transwell invasion assays with fibronectin or cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) serving as chemoattractant. Importantly, PC3-luc cells cultured on fibronectin showed rapid dissemination and localized in lungs following tail vein injection in athymic male nude mice; however, in silibinin-treated PC3-luc cells, dissemination and lung localization was largely compromised. Molecular analyses revealed that silibinin treatment modulated the fibronectin-induced expression of integrins (\u03b15, \u03b1V, \u03b21 and \u03b23), actin-remodeling (FAK, Src, GTPases, ARP2 and cortactin), apoptosis (cPARP and cleaved caspase 3), EMT (E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin), and cell survival (survivin and Akt) related signaling molecules in PC3 cells. Furthermore, PC3-xenograft tissue analyses confirmed the inhibitory effect of silibinin on fibronectin and integrins expression. Together, these results showed that silibinin targets PCA cells\u2019 interaction with fibronectin and inhibits their motility, invasiveness and survival; thus further supporting silibinin use in PCA intervention including its metastatic progression.",

Long-term exposure to GSP may serve as a novel chemoprotectant against three stages of DMN-induced liver carcinogenesis and tumorigenesis including initiation, promotion and progression. GSP may selectively protect against oxidative stress, genomic integrity and cell death patterns in vivo. These results demonstrate that GSP may serve as a novel therapeutic intervention against carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Genistein, an isoflavone present in soy products, has chemopreventive effects on mammary carcinogenesis. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of genistein on phorbol ester-induced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) that plays an important role in the pathophysiology of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. Pretreatment of cultured human breast epithelial (MCF10A) cells with genistein reduced COX-2 expression induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). There are multiple lines of evidence supporting that the induction of COX-2 is regulated by the eukaryotic transcription factor NF-\u03baB. Genistein failed to inhibit TPA-induced nuclear translocation and DNA binding of NF-\u03baB as well as degradation of I\u03baB. However, genistein abrogated the TPA-induced transcriptional activity of NF-\u03baB as determined by the luciferase reporter gene assay. Genistein inhibited phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB and its interaction with cAMP regulatory element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/p300 and TATA-binding protein (TBP). TPA-induced NF-\u03baB phosphorylation was abolished by pharmacological inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Likewise, pharmacologic inhibition or dominant negative mutation of ERK suppressed phosphorylation of p65. The above findings, taken together, suggest that genistein inhibits TPA-induced COX-2 expression in MCF10A cells by blocking ERK-mediated phosphorylation of p65 and its subsequent interaction with CBP and TBP.",

However, these pro-tumorigenic effects of MSCs are still being discovered and may even involve opposing effects. MSCs can be friends or enemies of cancer cells: they may stimulate tumor development by regulating immune surveillance, growth, and angiogenesis. On the other hand, they may inhibit tumor growth by inhibiting survival signaling such as Wnt and Akt pathway. MSCs have also been proposed as an attractive candidate for the delivery of anti-tumor agents, owing to their ability to home into tumor sites and to secrete cytokines. Detailed information about the mutual interactions between tumor cells and MSCs will undoubtedly lead to safer and more effective clinical therapy for tumors. In this article, we summarize a number of findings to provide current information on the potential roles of MSCs in tumor development; we then discuss the therapeutic potential of engineered MSCs to reveal any meaningful clinical applications.",

     "abstract": "Due to limited treatment options for advanced-stage metastatic breast cancer, a high priority should be given to develop non-toxic chemopreventive drugs. The value of various natural and dietary agents to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer is well established. Trianthema portulacastrum Linn. (Aizoaceae), a dietary and medicinal plant, has been found to exert antihepatotoxic and antihepatocarcinogenic properties in rodents. This study was initiated to investigate mechanism-based chemopreventive potential of an ethanolic extract of T. portulacastrum (TPE) against 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-initiated rat mammary gland carcinogenesis, an experimental tumor model that closely resembles human breast cancer. Rats had access to a basal diet supplemented with TPE to yield three dietary doses of the extract, i.e., 50, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/kg body weight. Following two weeks of TPE treatment, mammary tumorigenesis was initiated by oral administration of DMBA (50\u00a0mg/kg body weight). At the end of the study (16 weeks after DMBA exposure), TPE exhibited a striking reduction of DMBA-induced mammary tumor incidence, total tumor burden and average tumor weight and reversed intratumor histopathological alterations. TPE dose-dependently suppressed proliferating cell nuclear antigen and cyclin D1 expression, induced apoptosis, upregulated proapoptotic protein Bax, downregulated antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and diminished the expression of nuclear and cytosolic \u03b2-catenin in mammary tumors. Our results clearly provide the first experimental evidence that TPE exerts chemopreventive effect in the classical DMBA model of breast cancer by suppressing abnormal cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis mediated through alteration of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio. Mechanistically, TPE is capable of diminishing activated canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling to exhibit antiproliferative, proapoptotic and oncostatic effects during an early-stage breast cancer. These results may encourage further studies to explore full potential of T. portulacastrum phytoconstituents as breast cancer chemopreventive agents.",

Quantitative analysis revealed 7-(deoxyadenosine-N6-yl)-aristolactam II and 7-(deoxyguanosine-N2-yl)-aristolactam I that were previously detected as major DNA-AA adducts in different organs of AA-dosed rats, were detected as the major urine excreted adducts. Lower levels of 7-(deoxyadenosine-N6-yl)-aristolactam I and 7-(deoxyguanosine-N2-yl)-aristolactam II were also detected in the collected urine samples. The identities of the detected urinary DNA-AA adducts were confirmed by comparing chromatographic retention time with synthetic standards, by high-accuracy MS, and MS/MS analyses. LC\u2013MS/MS analysis of the urine samples collected from the AAs-dosed rats demonstrated a time-dependent decrease in the urinary adduct levels, indicating the urinary DNA-AA adduct levels were reflective of the tissue adduct levels.

We identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms, defined as master regulators of transcription, and genotyped them in a set of 218 colorectal cancer patients undergoing adjuvant 5-FU based therapy.Our results showed that the minor allele variant of the rs4846126 polymorphism was associated with poor overall and progression-free survival.

The integration of external information from publicly available gene expression repositories suggested that the rs4846126 polymorphism deserves further investigation. This variant potentially regulates the gene expression of 273 genes with some of them possibly associated to the patient's response to 5-FU treatment or colorectal cancer.Present results show that mining of public data repositories in combination with own data can be a fruitful approach to identify markers that affect therapy outcome.

     "abstract": "Glycosylases responsible for recognizing DNA lesions and initiating Base Excision Repair (BER) are impeded by the presence of histones, which are essential for compaction of the genetic material in the nucleus. Abasic sites are an abundant mutagenic lesion in the DNA, arising spontaneously and as the product of glycosylase activity, making it a common intermediate in BER. The apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) recognizes abasic sites and cleaves the DNA backbone adjacent to the lesion, creating the single-strand break essential for the subsequent steps of BER. In this study the endonuclease activity of human APE1 was measured on reconstituted nucleosome core particles (NCPs) with DNA containing enzymatically created abasic sites (AP) or the abasic site analog tetrahydrofuran (TF) at different rotational positions relative to the histone core surface. The presence of histones on the DNA reduced APE1 activity overall, and the magnitude was greatly influenced by differences in orientation of the lesions along the DNA gyre relative to the histone core. Abasic moieties oriented with their phosphate backbones adjacent to the underlying histones (In) were cleaved less efficiently than those oriented away from the histone core (Out) or between the In and Out orientations (Mid). The impact on APE1 at each orientation was very similar between the AP and TF lesions, highlighting the dependability of the TF abasic analog in APE1 activity measurements in nucleosomes. Measurement of APE1 binding to the NCP substrates reveals a substantial reduction in its interaction with nucleosomes compared to naked DNA, also in a lesion orientation-dependent manner, reinforcing the concept that reduction in APE1 activity on nucleosomes is due to occlusion from its abasic DNA substrate by the histones. These results suggest that APE1 activity in nucleosomes, like BER glycosylases, is primarily regulated by its chance interactions with transiently exposed lesions.",

Studies show that gold nanoparticles can cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, as well as accumulate in the brain. Therefore, this study was undertaken to better understand the effects of gold nanoparticles on rat brains. DNA damage parameters were evaluated in the cerebral cortex of adult rats submitted to acute and chronic administration of gold nanoparticles of two different diameters: 10 and 30\u00a0nm. During acute administration, adult rats received a single intraperitoneal injection of either gold nanoparticles or saline solution. During chronic administration, adult rats received a daily single injection for 28 days of the same gold nanoparticles or saline solution. Twenty-four hours after either single (acute) or last injection (chronic), the rats were euthanized by decapitation, their brains removed, and the cerebral cortices isolated for evaluation of DNA damage parameters. Our study showed that acute administration of gold nanoparticles in adult rats presented higher levels of damage frequency and damage index in their DNA compared to the control group. It was also observed that gold nanoparticles of 30\u00a0nm presented higher levels of damage frequency and damage index in the DNA compared to the 10\u00a0nm ones. When comparing the effects of chronic administration of gold nanoparticles of 10 and 30\u00a0nm, we observed that occurred significant different index and frequency damage, comparing with control group. However, there is no difference between the 10 and 30\u00a0nm groups in the levels of DNA damage for both parameters of the Comet assay. Results suggest that gold nanoparticles for both sizes cause DNA damage for chronic as well as acute treatments, although a higher damage was observed for the chronic one.",

     "abstract": "Curcumin and trans-resveratrol are well-known antioxidant polyphenols with radiomodulatory properties, radioprotecting non-cancerous cells while radiosensitizing tumor cells. This dual action may be the result of their radical scavenging properties and their effects on cell-cycle checkpoints that are activated in response to radiation-induced chromosomal damage. It could be also caused by their effect on regulatory pathways with impact on detoxification enzymes, the up-regulation of endogenous protective systems, and cell-cycle-dependent processes of DNA damage. This work aims to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the dual action of these polyphenols and investigates under which conditions they exhibit radioprotecting or radiosensitizing properties. The peripheral blood lymphocyte test system was used, applying concentrations ranging from 1.4 to 140\u00a0\u03bcM curcumin and 2.2 to 220\u00a0\u03bcM trans-resveratrol. The experimental design focuses first on their radioprotective effects in non-cycling lymphocytes, as uniquely visualized using cell fusion-mediated premature chromosome condensation, excluding, thus, cell-cycle interference to repair processes and activation of checkpoints. Second, the radiosensitizing potential of these chemicals on the induction of chromatid breaks in cultured lymphocytes following G2-phase irradiation was evaluated by a standardized G2-chromosomal radiosensitivity predictive assay. This assay uses caffeine for G2-checkpoint abrogation and it was applied to obtain an internal control for radiosensitivity testing, which simulates conditions similar to those of the highly radiosensitive lymphocytes of AT patients. The results demonstrate for the first time the cell-cycle-dependent action of these polyphenols. When non-cycling cells are irradiated, the radioprotective properties of curcumin and trans-resveratrol are more prominent. However, when cycling cells are irradiated during G2-phase, the radiosensitizing features of these compounds are more pronounced. This observation offers a new biological basis for the mechanisms underlying the action of these polyphenols in cancer radiotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Sequences like the core element of TATA box and CpG island are frequently encountered in the genome and related to transcription. The fate of repair of clustered abasic sites in such sequences of genomic importance is largely unknown. This prompted us to investigate the sequence dependence of cleavage efficiency of APE1 enzyme at abasic sites within the core sequences of TATA box and CpG island using fluorescence dynamics and reaction kinetics. Simultaneous molecular dynamics study through steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy using unique ethidium bromide dye release assay confirmed an elevated amount of abasic site cleavage of the TATA box sequence as compared to the core CpG island. Reaction kinetics showed that catalytic efficiency of APE1 for abasic site cleavage of core CpG island sequence was \u223c4 times lower as compared to that of the TATA box. Higher value of Km was obtained from the core CpG island sequence than the TATA box sequence. This suggests a greater binding effect of APE1 enzyme on TATA sequence that signifies a prominent role of the sequence context of the DNA substrate. Evidently, a faster response from APE1 was obtained for clustered abasic damage repair of TATA box core sequences than CpG island consensus sequences. The neighboring bases of the abasic sites in the complementary DNA strand were found to have significant contribution in addition to the flanking bases in modulating APE1 activity. The repair refractivity of the bistranded clustered abasic sites arise from the slow processing of the second abasic site, consequently resulting in decreased overall production of potentially lethal double strand breaks.",

     "abstract": "BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor that maintains genomic integrity through double strand break (DSB) repair and replication fork protection. The BRC motifs and an exon 27-encoded domain (Ex27) of BRCA2 interact with the recombinase RAD51 to, respectively, facilitate the formation and stability of a RAD51 filament on single strand DNA. The BRC-RAD51 associations enable DSB repair while the Ex27-RAD51 association protects the nascent replication strand from MRE11-mediated degradation. MRE11 is a nuclease that facilitates the generation of 3\u2032 overhangs needed for homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DSB repair. Here we report the dynamics of replication fork maintenance in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells deleted for Ex27 (brca2lex1/lex2) after exposure to hydroxyurea (HU) that depletes nucleotides. HU conditions were varied from mild to severe. Mild conditions induce an ATR-response to replication fork stalling while severe conditions induce a DNA-PKCS-response to replication fork collapse and a DSB. These responses were differentiated by replication protein A (RPA) phosphorylation. We found that Ex27 deletion reduced MRE11 localization to stalled, but not collapsed, replication forks and that Ex27-deletion caused a proportionately more severe phenotype with HU dose. Therefore, the BRCA2 exon 27 domain maintains chromosomal integrity at both stalled and collapsed replication forks consistent with involvement in both replication fork maintenance and double strand break repair.",

     "abstract": "Due to the critical role of the H2AX histone variant in double-strand break repair, genetic variants in the H2AX gene, H2AFX, may influence cancer susceptibility. Genetic association studies have correlated H2AFX upstream variants with cancer risk; however it is unclear if any are causal. H2AFX has at least two alternate transcripts that encode the same reading frame; a short 0.6\u00a0kb transcript that lacks an intron or poly-A tail and is predicted to be highly expressed during the replication stage of the cell cycle, and a long 1.6\u00a0kb poly-A tailed transcript that is expressed in a replication-independent manner. To examine the functional impact of the rs643788, rs8551, rs7759, and rs2509049 upstream variants, we characterized their influence on gene expression, cell survival after DNA assault, and transcription factor binding. Analysis of allelic imbalance using quantitative sequencing of cDNA from lymphoblast cell lines did not reveal any difference in expression of the 1.6\u00a0kb polyadenylated transcript between the common H2AFX upstream haplotypes. We did, however, identify a previously unreported 197 base pair intron in the H2AFX 3\u2032untranslated region that appears to be present regardless of haplotype. Assessment of cell survival after irradiation treatment did not show any difference in survival between cell lines of different haplotypes. Gel shift assays revealed that the rs643788 C allele disrupts YY1 transcription factor binding and the rs2509049 C allele binds more strongly to a protein complex than does the rs2509049 T allele. Though we did not identify any differences in expression or survival between haplotypes, differential protein binding at two of the polymorphisms suggests further functional analyses may reveal a role for these variants in influencing gene expression at specific points of the cell cycle or in specific tissues.",

Cells employ multiple and specific repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair (NER), as unrepaired DNA damage has deleterious consequences and could give rise to carcinogenesis. Gene polymorphisms play a crucial role in predicting the risk and prognosis of cancer. Polymorphisms of NER-related genes could alter the ability of NER to effectively monitor and repair DNA damage, and thus may be associated with genetic susceptibility, chemotherapeutic sensitivity and prognosis of cancer. In recent years, increasing studies have focused on the association between polymorphisms of NER genes and gastric cancer, the world's fourth most common cancer and the second most common cause for cancer-related death.

The aim of this analysis was to evaluate the relationship between solar UV exposure and methylation pattern in LINE-1 repetitive elements in PBL DNA and to see if serum 25(OH)D levels modify it.Personal solar UV exposure was estimated from hours of outdoor exposure over 6 weeks recalled at the time of blood collection in 208 male and female participants living in South Australia. Methylation in LINE-1 repetitive elements was assessed in PBL using pyrosequencing.Methylation in LINE-1 decreased with increasing solar UV exposure (% decrease\u00a0=\u00a00.5% per doubling of sUV; 95%CI: \u22120.7 to \u22120.2 pvalue\u00a0=\u00a00.00003).

To investigate DNA damage and the changes of the cell cycle distribution induced by OTA, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293 cells) were incubated with various concentrations of OTA for 24\u00a0h in vitro. The results indicated that OTA treatment led to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to a decrease of the mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m). OTA-induced DNA damage in HEK 293 cells was evidenced by DNA comet tails formation and increased expression of \u03b3-H2AX. In addition, OTA could induce cell cycle arrest at the S phase in HEK 293 cells. The expression of key cell cycle regulatory factors that were critical to the S phase, including cyclin A2, cyclin E1, and CDK2, were further detected. The expression of cyclin A2, cyclin E1, and CDK2 were significantly decreased by OTA treatment at both the mRNA and protein levels. The apoptosis of HEK 293 cells after OTA treatment was observed using Hoechst 33342 staining. The results confirmed that OTA did induce apoptosis in HEK 293 cells. In conclusion, our results provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms by which OTA might promote nephrotoxicity.",

The micronucleus results showed a gradual decrease in the slope of the dose\u2013response curve between days 2 and 15. The data were consistent with a model assuming two components in RIGI. The first component is characterized by dose-dependent increase in micronuclei. It may persist more than ten cell generations depending on dose, but eventually disappears. The second component is more persistent and independent of dose above a threshold higher than 0.2\u00a0Gy. Gene expression analysis 2 days after irradiation at 5\u00a0Gy showed consistent changes in genes that typically respond to DNA damage. However, the consistency of changes decreased with time, suggesting that non-specificity and increased heterogeneity of gene expression are characteristic to the second, more persistent component of RIGI.",

     "abstract": "Alkylating agents are used in anti-tumor chemotherapy because they bind covalently to DNA and generate adducts that may lead to cell death. Bifunctional (HN2) and monofunctional (HN1) nitrogen are two such agents, and HN2 was the first drug successfully employed in anti-leukemia chemotherapy. Currently, HN2 is used either alone or combined with other drugs to treat Hodgkin's disease. It is well known that several crosslinking agents require metabolic activation via reactive oxygen species (ROS) to exert their lethal effects. The objective of this work was therefore to determine whether the abovementioned mustards would also require metabolic activation to exert lethal action against Escherichia coli. For this purpose, we measured survival following exposure to HN2 in E. coli strains that were deficient in nucleotide excision repair (uvrA NER mutant), base excision repair (xthA nfo nth fpg BER mutant) or superoxide dismutase (sodAB mutant) activity. We also performed the same experiments in cells pretreated with an iron chelator (2,2\u2032-dipyridyl, DIP). The NER and BER mutants were only sensitive to HN2 treatment (survival rates similar to those of the wild-type were achieved with 5-fold lower HN2 doses). However, wild-type and sodAB strains were not sensitive to treatment with HN2. In all tested strains, survival dropped by 2.5-fold following pretreatment with DIP compared to treatment with HN2 alone. Furthermore, DIP treatment increased ROS generation in both wild type and sodAB-deficient strains. Based on these data and on the survival of the SOD-deficient strain, we suggest that the increased production of ROS caused by Fe2+ chelation may potentiate the lethal effects of HN2 but not HN1. This potentiation may arise as a consequence of enhancement in the number of or modification of the type of lesions formed. No sensitization was observed for the non-crosslinkable HN2 analog, HN1.",

     "abstract": "Childhood exposure to ionizing radiation increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer later in life and this is suggested to be due to higher proliferation of the young thyroid. The interest of using high-LET alpha particles from Astatine-211 (211At), concentrated in the thyroid by the same mechanism as 131I [1], in cancer treatment has increased during recent years because of its high efficiency in inducing biological damage and beneficial dose distribution when compared to low-LET radiation. Most knowledge of the DNA damage response in thyroid is from studies using low-LET irradiation and much less is known of high-LET irradiation. In this paper we investigated the DNA damage response and biological consequences to photons from Cobolt-60 (60Co) and alpha particles from 211At in normal primary thyrocytes of different cell cycle status. For both radiation qualities the intensity levels of \u03b3H2AX decreased during the first 24\u00a0h in both cycling and stationary cultures and complete repair was seen in all cultures but cycling cells exposed to 211At. Compared to stationary cells alpha particles were more harmful for cycling cultures, an effect also seen at the pChk2 levels. Increasing ratios of micronuclei per cell nuclei were seen up to 1\u00a0Gy 211At. We found that primary thyrocytes were much more sensitive to alpha particle exposure compared with low-LET photons. Calculations of the relative biological effectiveness yielded higher RBE for cycling cells compared with stationary cultures at a modest level of damage, clearly demonstrating that cell cycle status influences the relative effectiveness of alpha particles.",

To elucidate the nature of this reciprocal effect, we examined the interaction between \u03b1-irradiated human macrophage cells U937 and its bystander HL-7702 hepatocyte cells using a cell co-culture system. Results showed that after 6\u00a0h of cell co-culture, mitochondria depolarization corresponding to apoptosis was significantly induced in the HL-7702 cells, but the formation of micronuclei in the irradiated U937 cells was markedly decreased compared to that without cell co-culture treatment. This reciprocal effect was not observed when the cell membrane signaling pathway was blocked by filipin that inhibited cAMP transmission from bystander cells to irradiated cells. After treatment of cells with exogenous cAMP, forskolin (an activator of cAMP) or KH-7 (an inhibitor of cAMP), respectively, it was confirmed that cAMP communication from bystander cells to targeted cells could mitigate radiation damage in U739 cells, and this cAMP insufficiency in the bystander cells contributed to the enhancement of bystander apoptosis. Moreover, the bystander apoptosis in HL-7702 cells was aggravated by cAMP inhibition but it could not be evoked when p53 of HL-7702 cells was knocked down no matter of forskolin and KH-7 treatment. In conclusion, this study disclosed that cAMP could be released from bystander HL-7702 cells and compensated to \u03b1-irradiated U937 cells through a membrane signaling pathway and this cAMP communication played a profound role in regulating the reciprocal bystander effects.",

Inhibition of endogenous H2S/CSE pathway drastically decreased the proliferation of HepG2 and PLC/PRF/5 cells, and it also enhanced ROS production and mitochondrial disruption, pronounced DNA damage and increased apoptosis. Moreover, this increase of apoptosis was associated with the activation of p53 and p21 accompanied by a decreased ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and up-regulation of phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and caspase-3 activity. In addition, the negative regulation of cell proliferation by inhibition of H2S/CSE system correlated with the blockage of cell mitogenic and survival signal transduction of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) via down-regulating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) activation.

We investigated a dinB mutation, \u0394(dinB-yafN)883(::kan) [referred to as \u0394dinB883], which strongly sensitized E. coli cells to both UV- and X-radiation killing. Earlier reports indicated dinB mutations had no obvious effect on UV radiation sensitivity which we confirmed by showing that normal UV radiation sensitivity is conferred by the \u0394dinB749 allele. Compared to a wild-type strain, the \u0394dinB883 mutant was most sensitive (160-fold) in early to mid-logarithmic growth phase and much less sensitive (twofold) in late log or stationary phases, thus showing a growth phase-dependence for UV radiation sensitivity. This sensitizing effect of \u0394dinB883 is assumed to be completely dependent upon the presence of UmuDC protein; since the \u0394dinB883 mutation did not sensitize the \u0394umuDC strain to UV radiation killing throughout log phase and early stationary phase growth. The DNA damage checkpoint activity of UmuDC was clearly affected by \u0394dinB883 as shown by testing a umuC104 \u0394dinB883 double-mutant. The sensitivities of the \u0394umuDC strain and the \u0394dinB883 \u0394umuDC double-mutant strain were significantly greater than for the \u0394dinB883 strain, suggesting that the \u0394dinB883 allele only partially suppresses UmuDC activity. The \u0394dinB883 mutation partially sensitized (fivefold) uvrA and uvrB strains to UV radiation, but did not sensitize a \u0394recA strain. A comparison of the DNA sequences of the \u0394dinB883 allele with the sequences of the \u0394(dinB-yafN)882(::kan) and \u0394dinB749 alleles, which do not sensitize cells to UV radiation, revealed \u0394dinB883 is likely a \u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutation. The \u0394dinB883 allele encodes the first 54 amino acids of wild-type DinB followed by 29 predicted residues resulting from the continuation of the dinB reading frame into an adjacent insertion fragment. The resulting polypeptide is proposed to interfere directly or indirectly with UmuDC function(s) involved in protecting cells against the lethal effects of radiation.",

This report presents, for the first time, the somatic changes and promoter hypermethylation in VHL in a cohort of 300 RCC patients from Pakistan.To identify mutations in the VHL gene, direct DNA sequencing was carried out. Epigenetic silencing was investigated by using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction.Our data showed molecular alterations in the VHL gene in 163 (54%) renal cell carcinoma patients. Somatic mutations were found in 87 (29%) patients and 35 novel mutations were identified. VHL promoter hyper-methylation analysis showed epigenetic changes in 106 (35%) out of 300 patients. Patients who had no evidence of molecular alterations in the VHL gene were significantly younger than patients who carried some molecular change. Molecular alterations in the VHL gene were not restricted to clear-cell RCCs (ccRCCs).This is the first report that identifies molecular aberrations in the VHL gene from a South Asian population. The frequency of somatic mutation is lower and that of promoter hypermethylation is higher when compared with data from other parts of the world. The data has important implications in the population-specific application of tailored preventive and therapeutic regimens in non-familial RCCs.",

Here we studied the mechanism of NM-induced skin toxicity in response to double strand breaks (DSBs) resulting in cell cycle arrest to facilitate DNA repair, as a model for developing countermeasures against vesicant-induced skin injuries. NM exposure of mouse epidermal JB6 cells decreased cell growth and caused S-phase arrest. Consistent with these biological outcomes, NM exposure also increased comet tail extent moment and the levels of DNA DSB repair molecules phospho H2A.X Ser139 and p53 Ser15 indicating NM-induced DNA DSBs. Since DNA DSB repair occurs via non homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) or homologous recombination repair (HRR) pathways, next we studied these two pathways and noted their activation as defined by an increase in phospho- and total DNA-PK levels, and the formation of Rad51 foci, respectively. To further analyze the role of these pathways in the cellular response to NM-induced cytotoxicity, NHEJ and HRR were inhibited by DNA-PK inhibitor NU7026 and Rad51 inhibitor BO2, respectively. Inhibition of NHEJ did not sensitize cells to NM-induced decrease in cell growth and cell cycle arrest. However, inhibition of the HRR pathway caused a significant increase in cell death, and prolonged G2M arrest following NM exposure. Together, our findings, indicating that HRR is the key pathway involved in the repair of NM-induced DNA DSBs, could be useful in developing new therapeutic strategies against vesicant-induced skin injury.",

     "abstract": "DNA glycosylases carry out the first step of base excision repair by removing damaged bases from DNA. The N3-methyladenine (3MeA) DNA glycosylases specialize in alkylation repair and are either constitutively expressed or induced by exposure to alkylating agents. To study the functional and evolutionary significance of constitutive versus inducible expression, we expressed two closely related yeast 3MeA DNA glycosylases \u2013 inducible Saccharomyces cerevisiae MAG and constitutive S. pombe Mag1 \u2013 in a glycosylase-deficient Escherichia coli strain. In both cases, constitutive expression conferred resistance to alkylating agent exposure. However, in the absence of exogenous alkylation, high levels of expression of both glycosylases were deleterious. We attribute this toxicity to excessive glycosylase activity, since suppressing spMag1 expression correlated with improved growth in liquid culture, and spMag1 mutants exhibiting decreased glycosylase activity showed improved growth and viability. Selection of a random spMag1 mutant library for increased survival in the presence of exogenous alkylation resulted in the selection of hypomorphic mutants, providing evidence for the presence of a genetic barrier to the evolution of enhanced glycosylase activity when constitutively expressed. We also show that low levels of 3MeA glycosylase expression improve fitness in our glycosylase-deficient host, implying that 3MeA glycosylase activity is likely necessary for repair of endogenous lesions. These findings suggest that 3MeA glycosylase activity is evolutionarily conserved for repair of endogenously produced alkyl lesions, and that inducible expression represents a common strategy to rectify deleterious effects of excessive 3MeA activity in the absence of exogenous alkylation challenge.",

However, reports on RIBE with relevance to cancer radiotherapy especially investigating the bidirectional and criss-cross bystander communications between cancer and normal cells are limited. Hence, in present study employing co-culture approach, we have investigated the bystander cross-talk between lung cancer (A549) and normal (WI38) cells after proton-microbeam irradiation using \u03b3-H2AX foci fluorescence as a measure of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). We observed that in A549\u2013A549 co-cultures, irradiated A549 cells exert damaging effects in bystander A549 cells, which were found to be mediated through gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). However, in A549\u2013WI38 co-cultures, irradiated A549 did not affect bystander WI38 cells. Rather, bystander WI38 cells induced inverse protective signalling (rescue effect) in irradiated A549 cells, which was independent of GJIC. On the other hand, in response to irradiated WI38 cells neither of the bystander cells (A549 or WI38) showed significant increase in \u03b3-H2AX foci. The observed bystander signalling between tumour and normal cells may have potential implications in therapeutic outcome of cancer radiotherapy.",

The potential for civilian and military personnel exposure to DU is rising, but there are limited data on the potential health hazards of DU exposure. Previous laboratory research indicates DU is a potential carcinogen, but epidemiological studies remain inconclusive. DU is genotoxic, inducing DNA double strand breaks, chromosome damage and mutations, but the mechanisms of genotoxicity or repair pathways involved in protecting cells against DU-induced damage remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of homologous recombination repair deficiency on DU-induced genotoxicity using RAD51D and XRCC3-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. Cells deficient in XRCC3 (irs1SF) exhibited similar cytotoxicity after DU exposure compared to wild-type (AA8) and XRCC3-complemented (1SFwt8) cells, but DU induced more break-type and fusion-type lesions in XRCC3-deficient cells compared to wild-type and XRCC3-complemented cells. Surprisingly, loss of RAD51D did not affect DU-induced cytotoxicity or genotoxicity. DU induced selective X-chromosome fragmentation irrespective of RAD51D status, but loss of XRCC3 nearly eliminated fragmentation observed after DU exposure in wild-type and XRCC3-complemented cells. Thus, XRCC3, but not RAD51D, protects cells from DU-induced breaks and fusions and also plays a role in DU-induced chromosome fragmentation.",

Our previous study demonstrated that a loss of a whole chromosome is induced in human lymphocytes by colcemid, a well-known aneugen. Here, to clarify the mechanism for colcemid-induced chromosome loss, we investigated the relationship between chromosome loss and DNA fragmentation in human lymphoblastoid cells treated with colcemid (an aneugen) compared with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS; a clastogen). We analyzed the number of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) signals targeted for a whole chromosome 2 in cytokinesis-blocked binucleated TK6 cells and WTK-1 cells treated with colcemid and MMS, and concurrently detected DNA fragmentation by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay. Results revealed that DNA fragmentation occurred in 60% of all binucleated TK6 cells harboring colcemid-induced chromosome loss (30% of micronuclei and 30% of main nuclei). DNA fragmentation was observed in colcemid-induced micronuclei containing a whole chromosome but not in MMS-induced micronuclei containing chromosome fragments. In contrast, colcemid-induced nondisjunction had no effect on induction of DNA fragmentation, suggesting that DNA fragmentation was triggered by micronuclei containing a whole chromosome but not by micronuclei containing chromosome fragments or nondisjunction. In addition, the frequency of binucleated cells harboring chromosome loss with DNA fragmentation in micronuclei or main nuclei was higher in wild-type p53 TK6 cells than in mutated-p53 WTK-1 cells treated with colcemid. Taken together, these present and previous results suggest that colcemid-induced chromosome loss is caused by DNA fragmentation, which is triggered by a micronucleus with a whole chromosome and controlled by the p53-dependent pathway.",

One of such stocks is the Wistar Hannover GALAS rat. However, the colony of Wistar Hannover GALAS rat has been suspected of keeping a problematic mutation that manifests two distinct spontaneous abnormalities, goiter and dwarfism, which often confuses study results. We have successfully identified the responsible mutation, a guanine to thymine transversion at the acceptor site (3\u2032 end) of intron 6 in the thyroglobulin (Tg) gene (Tgc.749\u22121G>T), that induces a complete missing of exon 7 from the whole Tg transcript by mating experiments and subsequent molecular analyses. The following observations confirmed that Tgc.749\u22121G>T/Tgc.749\u22121G>T homozygotes manifested both dwarfism and goiter, while Tgc.749\u22121G>T/+ heterozygotes had only a goiter with normal appearance, suggesting that the mutant phenotypes inherit as an autosomal semi-dominant trait. The mutant phenotypes, goiter and dwarfism, mimicked those caused by typical endocrine disrupters attacking the thyroid. Hence a simple and reliable diagnostic methodology has been developed for genomic DNA-based genotyping of animals. The diagnostic methodology reported here would allow users of Wistar Hannover GALAS rats to evaluate their study results precisely by carefully interpreting the data obtained from Tgc.749\u22121G>T/+ heterozygotes having externally undetectable thyroidal lesions.",

Information collected by food frequency questionnaire on meat intake and preparation methods were used to estimate HCA and benzo(a)pyrene (BaP, a PAH) intake. We tested 7 nsSNPs in 5 NER genes: XPC A499V and K939Q, XPD D312N and K751Q, XPF R415Q, XPG D1104H, and RAD23B A249V.

Non-double strand break (DSB) clustered damage has been shown to compromise the base excision repair pathway, extending the lifetimes of the lesions within the cluster, compared to isolated lesions. This increases the likelihood the lesions persist to replication and thus increasing the mutagenic potential of the lesions within the cluster. Lesions formed by ionizing radiation include 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) and 2-deoxyribonolactone (dL). dL poses an additional challenge to the cell as it is not repaired by the short-patch base excision repair pathway. Here we show recalcitrant dL repair is reflected in mutations observed when DNA containing it and a proximal 8-oxodGuo is replicated in Escherichia coli. 8-oxodGuo in close proximity to dL on the opposing DNA strand results in an enhanced frequency of mutation of the lesions within the cluster and a 20 base sequence flanking the clustered damage site in an E. coli based plasmid assay. In vitro repair of a dL lesion is reduced when compared to the repair of an abasic (AP) site and a tetrahydrofuran (THF), and this is due mainly to a reduction in the activity of polymerase \u03b2, leading to retarded FEN1 and ligase 1 activities.

Due to its high bioavailability in urine after ingestion, AITC has been considered a promising antineoplastic agent against bladder cancer. Because TP53 mutations are the most common alterations in bladder cancer cells and are frequently detected in in situ carcinomas, in this study, we investigated whether the AITC effects in bladder cancer cells are dependent on the TP53 status. Two bladder transitional carcinoma cell lines were used: RT4, with wild-type TP53; and T24, mutated TP53 gene. AITC was tested at concentrations of 0.005, 0.0625, 0.0725, 0.0825, 0.0925, 0.125 and 0.25\u00a0\u03bcM in cytotoxicity, cell and clonogenic survival assays, comet and micronucleus assays and for its effects on cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry and on TP53 gene expression. The data showed increased primary DNA damage in both cell lines; however, lower concentrations of AITC were able to induce genotoxicity in the mutant cells for the TP53 gene. Furthermore, the results demonstrated increased apoptosis and necrosis rates in the wild-type cells, but not in mutated TP53 cells, and cell cycle arrest in the G2 phase for mutated cells after AITC treatment. No significant differences were detected in TP53 gene expression in the two cell lines. In conclusion, AITC caused cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis rates and varying genotoxicity dependent on the TP53 status. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that those differences could reflect other intrinsic genetic alterations in the examined cell lines, which may also carry mutations in genes other than TP53. Therefore, further studies using other molecular targets need to be performed to better understand the mechanisms by which AITC may exert its antineoplastic properties against tumor cells.",

To date, the role of genetic variants in pre-miRNAs on coronary artery disease (CAD) risk remains poorly understood. Here we aimed to evaluate the influence of three common SNPs in pre-miRNAs (miR-146a rs2910164 G>C, miR-196a2 rs11614913 C>T, miR-499 rs3746444 T>C) on individual susceptibility to CAD in a Chinese population of 295 CAD patients and 283 controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. In a logistic regression analysis, we detected an association of rs2910164 in pre-miR-146a with the CAD risk; compared with the GG homozygotes, the GC heterozygotes [odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.89, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.06\u20133.36, P\u00a0=\u00a00.029] and the CC homozygotes (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.83, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20133.32, P\u00a0=\u00a00.046) genotype were statistically significantly associated with the increased risk for CADs.

Individuals carrying rs11614913 GC or CC genotypes showed 3.2-fold higher expression compared to GG genotype carriers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We observed no association of the other two SNPs in miR-196a2 (rs11614913) and miR-499 (rs3746444) with the CAD incidence.

However, in recA730 lexA(Def) strains, the enzyme is expressed under optimal conditions allowing it to compete with the cell's replicase for access to undamaged chromosomal DNA and leads to a substantial increase in spontaneous mutagenesis. We have recently shown that a Y11A substitution in the \u201csteric gate\u201d residue of UmuC reduces both base and sugar selectivity of pol V, but instead of generating an increased number of spontaneous mutations, strains expressing umuC_Y11A are poorly mutable in vivo. This phenotype is attributed to efficient RNase HII-initiated repair of the misincorporated ribonucleotides that concomitantly removes adjacent misincorporated deoxyribonucleotides. We have utilized the ability of the pol V steric gate mutant to promote incorporation of large numbers of errant ribonucleotides into the E. coli genome to investigate the fundamental mechanisms underlying ribonucleotide excision repair (RER). Here, we demonstrate that RER is normally facilitated by DNA polymerase I (pol I) via classical \u201cnick translation\u201d. In vitro, pol I displaces 1\u20133 nucleotides of the RNA/DNA hybrid and through its 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 (exo/endo) nuclease activity releases ribo- and deoxyribonucleotides from DNA. In vivo, umuC_Y11A-dependent mutagenesis changes significantly in polymerase-deficient, or proofreading-deficient polA strains, indicating a pivotal role for pol I in ribonucleotide excision repair (RER). However, there is also considerable redundancy in the RER pathway in E. coli. Pol I's strand displacement and FLAP-exo/endonuclease activities can be facilitated by alternate enzymes, while the DNA polymerization step can be assumed by high-fidelity pol III. We conclude that RNase HII and pol I normally act to minimize the genomic instability that is generated through errant ribonucleotide incorporation, but that the \u201cnick-translation\u201d activities encoded by the single pol I polypeptide can be undertaken by a variety of back-up enzymes.",

     "abstract": "Illegitimate V(D)J recombination at oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is implicated in formation of several T cell malignancies. Notch1 and Bcl11b, genes involved in developing T cell specification, selection, proliferation, and survival, were previously shown to contain hotspots for deletional illegitimate V(D)J recombination associated with radiation-induced thymic lymphoma. Interestingly, these deletions were also observed in wild-type animals. In this study, we conducted frequency, clonality, and junctional processing analyses of Notch1 and Bcl11b deletions during mouse development and compared results to published analyses of authentic V(D)J rearrangements at the T cell receptor beta (TCR\u03b2) locus and illegitimate V(D)J deletions observed at the human, nonimmune HPRT1 locus not involved in T cell malignancies. We detect deletions in Notch1 and Bcl11b in thymic and splenic T cell populations, consistent with cells bearing deletions in the circulating lymphocyte pool. Deletions in thymus can occur in utero, increase in frequency between fetal and postnatal stages, are detected at all ages examined between fetal and 7 months, exhibit only limited clonality (contrasting with previous results in radiation-sensitive mouse strains), and consistent with previous reports are more frequent in Bcl11b, partially explained by relatively high Recombination Signal Information Content (RIC) scores. Deletion junctions in Bcl11b exhibit greater germline nucleotide loss, while in Notch1 palindromic (P) nucleotides are more abundant, although average P nucleotide length is similar for both genes and consistent with results at the TCR\u03b2 locus. Non-templated (N) nucleotide insertions appear to increase between fetal and postnatal stages for Notch1, consistent with normal terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) activity; however, neonatal Bcl11b junctions contain elevated levels of N insertions. Finally, contrasting with results at the HPRT1 locus, we find no obvious age or gender bias in junctional processing, and inverted repeats at recessed coding ends (Pr nucleotides) correspond mostly to single-base additions consistent with normal TdT activity.",

     "abstract": "The catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE1) functions primarily in nuclear DNA replication and repair. Recently, POLE1 mutations were detected frequently in colorectal and endometrial carcinomas while with lower frequency in several other types of cancer, and the p.P286R and p.V411L mutations were the potential mutation hotspots in human cancers. Nevertheless, the mutation frequency of POLE1 in ovarian cancer still remains largely unknown. Here, we screened a total of 251 Chinese samples with distinct subtypes of ovarian carcinoma for the presence of POLE1 hotspot mutations by direct sequencing. A heterozygous somatic POLE1 mutation, p.S297F (c.890C>T), but not p.P286R and p.V411L hotspot mutations observed in other cancer types, was identified in 3 out of 37 (8.1%) patients with ovarian endometrioid carcinoma; this mutation was evolutionarily highly conserved from Homo sapiens to Schizosaccharomyces. Of note, the POLE1 mutation coexisted with mutation in the ovarian cancer-associated PPP2R1A (protein phosphatase 2, regulatory subunit A, \u03b1) gene in a 46-year-old patient, who was also diagnosed with ectopic endometriosis in the benign ovary. In addition, a 45-year-old POLE1-mutated ovarian endometrioid carcinoma patient was also diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma while the remaining 52-year-old POLE1-mutated patient showed no additional distinctive clinical manifestation. In contrast to high frequency of POLE1 mutations in ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, no POLE1 mutations were identified in patients with other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. Our results showed for the first time that the POLE1 p.S297F mutation, but not p.P286R and p.V411L hotspot mutations observed in other cancer types, was frequent in Chinese ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, but absent in other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma. These results implicated that POLE1 p.S297F mutation might be actively involved in the pathogenesis of ovarian endometrioid carcinoma, but might not be actively involved in other subtypes of ovarian carcinoma.",

Despite intensive investment in improving early detection, PCA often escapes timely detection and mortality remains high; this malignancy being the second highest cancer-associated mortality in American men. Collectively, health care costs of PCA results in an immense financial burden that is only expected to grow. Additionally, even in cases of successful treatment, PCA is associated with long-term and pervasive effects on patients. A proactive alternative to treat PCA is to prevent its occurrence and progression prior to symptomatic malignancy. This may serve to address the issue of burgeoning healthcare costs and increasing number of sufferers. One potential regimen in service of this alternative is PCA chemoprevention. Here, chemical compounds with cancer preventive efficacy are identified on the basis of their potential in a host of categories: their historical medicinal use, correlation with reduced risk in population studies, non-toxicity, their unique chemical properties, or their role in biological systems. PCA chemopreventive agents are drawn from multiple broad classes of chemicals, themselves further subdivided based on source or potential effect, with most derived from natural products. Many such compounds have shown efficacy, varying from inhibiting deregulated PCA cell signaling, proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), invasion, metastasis, tumor growth and angiogenesis and inducing apoptosis. Overall, these chemopreventive agents show great promise in PCA pre-clinical models, though additional work remains to be done in effectively translating these findings into clinical use.",

To this end, rat cells (ADIPO-P2 cell line, derived from adipose cells from Sprague\u2013Dawley rat) were treated with a single concentration of SN (100\u00a0ng/ml), and chromosomal aberrations were analyzed 18\u00a0h and 10 and 15 days after treatment by using PNA-FISH with a pan-telomeric probe [Cy3-(CCCTAA)3] to detect (TTAGGG)n repeats. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a higher frequency of telomere dysfunction-related aberrations (additional telomeric FISH signals, extra-chromosomal telomeric FISH signals, and telomere FISH signal loss and duplications) in SN-exposed cultures vs. untreated cultures at every time points analyzed. The yield of SN-induced aberrations remained very similar at 18\u00a0h, 10 days as well as 15 days after treatment. Thus, our data demonstrate that SN induces persistent telomere dysfunction in mammalian cells. Moreover, we found that the level of telomerase activity in SN-treated cells was significantly lower (up to 77%) than that of untreated control cells at each time points analyzed. This fact suggests that telomerase could be involved in SN-induced telomere dysfunction.",

Germline mutations in \u03b3-ray-irradiated medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) were studied, focusing on the microsatellite loci. Mismatch-repair genes suppress microsatellite mutation by directly removing altered sequences at the nucleotide level, whereas the p53 gene suppresses genetic alterations by eliminating damaged cells. The contribution of these two defense mechanisms to radiation-induced microsatellite instability was addressed. The spontaneous mutation frequency was significantly higher in msh2\u2212/\u2212 males than in wild-type fish, whereas there was no difference in the frequency of radiation-induced mutations between msh2\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type fish. By contrast, irradiated p53\u2212/\u2212 fish exhibited markedly increased mutation frequencies, whereas their spontaneous mutation frequency was the same as that of wild-type fish. In the spermatogonia of the testis, radiation induced a high level of apoptosis both in wild-type and msh2\u2212/\u2212 fish, but negligible levels in p53\u2212/\u2212 fish.

In two previous studies we have observed that a 24-h pre-exposure to MF alters cellular responses to menadione-induced DNA damage. The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular changes that must occur already during the first 24\u00a0h of exposure to MF, and to explore whether the MF-induced changes in DNA damage response can lead to genomic instability in the progeny of the exposed cells. In order to answer these questions, human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were exposed to a 50-Hz, 100-\u03bcT MF for 24\u00a0h, followed by 3-h exposure to menadione. The main finding was that MF exposure was associated with increased level of micronuclei, used as an indicator of induced genomic instability, at 8 and 15\u00a0d after the exposures. Other delayed effects in MF-exposed cells included increased mitochondrial activity at 8\u00a0d, and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and lipid peroxidation at 15\u00a0d after the exposures. Oxidative processes (ROS production, reduced glutathione level, and mitochondrial superoxide level) were affected by MF immediately after the exposure. In conclusion, the present results suggest that MF exposure disturbs oxidative balance immediately after the exposure, which might explain our previous findings on MF altered cellular responses to menadione-induced DNA damage. Persistently elevated levels of micronuclei were found in the progeny of MF-exposed cells, indicating induction of genomic instability.",

A growing body of evidence suggests that oxidative stress may play a major role in the pathogenesis of FECD and that mitochondria of CE cells are its main target. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is particularly prone to oxidative stress and changes in mtDNA were reported in FECD patients. In the present work we studied mtDNA damage and repair, mtDNA copy number, and the 4977\u00a0bp common deletion in mtDNA in DM cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) isolated from FECD patients. PBLs from 35 FECD patients and 32 controls were challenged for 10\u00a0min with hydrogen peroxide at 20\u00a0\u03bcM and then left in a fresh medium for 3\u00a0h, resulting in a decrease in mtDNA copy number in both groups. Damage to mtDNA was not fully repaired after 3\u00a0h and the extent of remaining lesions was significantly higher in the patients than the controls. We observed a higher copy number and an increased extent of mtDNA damage as well as a higher ratio of the common 4977\u00a0bp deletion in DM cells of FECD patients than the controls. Our results confirm that mutagenesis of mtDNA may be involved in FECD pathogenesis and disturbance in mtDNA sensitivity to damaging agent as well as changes in mtDNA damage repair along with alternations in mtDNA copy number may underline this involvement.",

To further assess potential co-mutagenic effects of FA, we exposed A549 human lung cells to FA in combination with various mutagens and measured the induction and removal of DNA damage by the comet assay and the production of chromosomal mutations by the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN assay).

FA (10\u201375\u00a0\u03bcM) did not enhance the genotoxic and mutagenic activity of these mutagens under the test conditions applied. FA alone and in combination with MNU or MMS did not affect the expression (mRNA level) of the gene of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) in A549 cells.

     "abstract": "The fidelity with which organisms replicate their chromosomal DNA is of considerable interest. Detailed studies in the bacterium Escherichia coli have indicated that the fidelity of leading- and lagging-strand DNA replication is not the same, based on experiments in which the orientation of certain mutational targets on the chromosome was inverted relative to the movement of the replication fork: different mutation rates for several base-pair substitutions were observed depending on this orientation. While these experiments are indicative of differential replication fidelity in the two strands, a conclusion whether leading or lagging strand is the more accurate depends on knowledge of the primary mispairing error responsible for the base substitutions in question. A broad analysis of in vitro base-pairing preferences of DNA polymerases led us to propose that lagging-strand is the more accurate strand. In the present work, we present more direct in vivo evidence in support of this proposal. We determine the orientation dependence of mutant frequencies in ndk and dcd strains, which carry defined dNTP pool alterations. As these pool alterations lead to predictable effects on the array of possible mispairing errors, they mark the strands in which the observed errors occur. The combined results support the proposed higher accuracy of lagging-strand replication in E. coli.",

To establish that mutation of the tk gene in L5178Ytk(\u00b1) lymphoma cells by MMS and As3+ is mediated through mono-ubiquitinated annexin A1, L5178Ytk(\u00b1) lymphoma cells were treated with annexin A1 anti-sense oligonucleotide.

Nuclear extracts from L5178Ytk(\u00b1) lymphoma cells catalyzed translesion DNA synthesis with an oligonucleotide template containing 8-oxo-guanosine in an annexin A1 dependent manner. This translesion DNA synthesis was inhibited by the anti-mutagenic flavonoids, silibinin, quercetin and genistein, in a concentration dependent manner, but only slightly by flavone and flavonol. Because these observations implicate involvement of annexin A1 in mutagenesis, we examined if flavonoids suppress nuclear annexin A1 helicase activity. Silibinin, quercetin and genistein inhibited ssDNA binding, DNA chain annealing and DNA unwinding activities of purified nuclear mono-ubiquitinated annexin A1. Flavone and flavonol were ineffective. The apparent direct binding of anti-mutagenic flavonoids to the annexin A1 molecule was supported by fluorescence quenching.

In addition we discuss discrepancies from other studies concerning ERCC1 C118T.Progression-free survival was determined in 145 ACC patients treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in a phase 3 trial. For the in vitro studies regarding ERCC1 functionality, we transfected an ERCC1 negative cell line with 118C or 118T ERCC1. Cellular sensitivity and DNA repair capacity after exposure to oxaliplatin was examined by Sulphorodamine B growth inhibition assay, COMET assay and Rad51 foci staining.We found no association between ERCC1 C118T and progression-free or overall survival. In addition, transfection of either 118C or 118T restores DNA-repair capacity of UV20 cells to the same level and chemosensitivity to oxaliplatin was similar in ERCC1 118C and 118T transfected cells.This study shows that the ERCC1 C118T variants are not associated with survival in ACC patients treated with oxaliplatin or the in vitro sensitivity and DNA-repair capacity in 118C and 118T transfected cell lines. Therefore, ERCC1 C118T genotyping seems of no value in individualizing oxaliplatin based chemotherapy in ACC.",

     "abstract": "N3-methyladenine (3-mA), generated by the reaction of methylating agents with DNA, is considered a highly toxic but weakly mutagenic lesion. However, due to its intrinsic instability, some of the biological effects of the adduct can result from the formation of the corresponding depurination product [an apurinic (AP)-site]. Previously, we exploited Me-lex, i.e. {1-methyl-4-[1-methyl-4-(3-methoxysulfonylpropanamido)pyrrole-2-carboxamido]-pyrrole-2 carboxamido}propane, a minor groove equilibrium binder with selectivity for A/T rich sequences that efficiently reacts with DNA to afford 3-mA as the dominant product, to probe the biology of this lesion. Using human p53 cDNA as a target in a yeast system, a weak increase in mutagenicity was observed in the absence of Mag1 (3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase 1, mag1), the enzyme devoted to remove 3-mA from DNA. Moreover, a significant increase in mutagenicity occurred in the absence of the enzymes involved in the repair of AP-sites (AP endonucleases 1 and 2, apn1apn2). Since methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) has been extensively used to explore the biological effects of 3-mA, even though it produces 3-mA in low relative yield, we compared the toxicity and mutagenicity induced by MMS and Me-lex in yeast. A mutagenesis reporter plasmid was damaged in vitro by MMS and then transformed into wild-type and Translesion Synthesis (TLS) Pol\u03b6 (REV3) and Pol\u03b7 (RAD30) deficient strains. Furthermore, a mag1rad30 double mutant strain was constructed and transformed with the DNA plasmid damaged in vitro by Me-lex. The results confirm the important role of Pol\u03b6 in the mutagenic bypass of MMS and Me-lex induced lesions, with Pol\u03b7 contributing only towards the bypass of Me-lex induced lesions, mainly in an error-free way. Previous and present results point towards the involvement of AP-sites, derived from the depurination of 3-mA, in the observed toxicity and mutagenicity.",

We investigated the mechanism by which the redox modulator Trx1 affects base excision repair (BER) activity to understand the protective role of Trx1. We constructed a Trx1 knockdown system to demonstrate the specific mechanism of Trx1. DNA damage in terms of relative intensity of the DNA tail and \u03b3-H2AX foci was markedly higher in the Trx1 shRNA cells compared with that in the wild type cells, leading to increased cellular susceptibility to a sublethal dose of BER-inducible toxicant, nitrosomethylurea (NMU). In addition, we observed a modulatory role of Trx1 in the BER pathway via the p53 downstream gene, growth arrest, and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 \u03b1 (Gadd45a). The protein level and function of p53, a Trx1 downstream gene, coincidently decreased in the Trx1 shRNA cells. Furthermore, Trx1 shRNA cells showed decreased Gadd45a expression and interaction of Gadd45a with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) as well as APE1 activity. In conclusion, Trx1 might cooperate in the control of APE1 function by modulating the p53-mediated BER via the protein\u2013protein interaction between Gadd45a and APE1, providing insight into the novel role of redox factor Trx1 in modulation of BER.",

     "abstract": "\u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play a role in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Upon oxidation, PUFAs generate \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated aldehydes or enals, such as acrolein (Acr) and (E)-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), which can form cyclic adducts of deoxyguanosine (Acr-dG and HNE-dG, respectively) in DNA. Both Acr-dG and HNE-dG adducts have been detected in human and animal tissues and are potentially mutagenic and carcinogenic. In vivo levels of Acr-dG in DNA are at least two orders of magnitude higher than those of HNE-dG. In addition to the facile reaction with Acr, the higher levels of Acr-dG than HNE-dG in vivo may be due to a lower rate of repair. Previous studies have shown that HNE-dG adducts are repaired by the NER pathway (Choudhury et al. [42]). We hypothesize that Acr-dG adducts are repaired at a slower rate than HNE-dG and that HNE-dG in DNA may influence the repair of Acr-dG. In this study, using a DNA repair synthesis assay and a LC\u2013MS/MS method, we showed that Acr-dG in a plasmid DNA is repaired by NER proteins, but it is repaired at a much slower rate than HNE-dG in human colon cell extracts, and the slow repair of Acr-dG is likely due to poor recognition/excision of the lesions in DNA. Furthermore, using a plasmid DNA containing both adducts we found the repair of Acr-dG is significantly inhibited by HNE-dG, however, the repair of HNE-dG is not much affected by Acr-dG. This study demonstrates that the NER repair efficiencies of the two major structurally-related in vivo cyclic DNA adducts from lipid oxidation vary greatly. More importantly, the repair of Acr-dG can be significantly retarded by the presence of HNE-dG in DNA. Therefore, this study provides a mechanistic explanation for the higher levels of Acr-dG than HNE-dG observed in tissue DNA.",

Genetic hearing loss represents over 50% of all hearing loss cases in children and, due to the heterogeneity of the disorder, there is still a demand for the isolation and characterization of new genes and alleles.Here we report phenotypic and molecular characterization of a new mouse model for hereditary hearing loss. The mutant rodador, isolated by Massironi and colleagues in 2006, presents an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by deafness and balance dysfunction associated with abnormal stereocilia in the inner ear.The mutation was mapped to mouse chromosome 10, and characterization of the gene Pcdh15 revealed an AT-to-GC transition in intron 23 of mutant animals. The alteration led to the switch of a dinucleotide ApA for ApG, creating a novel intronic acceptor splice site, which leads to incorporation of eight intronic bases into the processed mRNA and alteration of the downstream reading frame. In silico analysis indicated that the mutated protein is truncated and lacks two cadherin domains, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Real Time PCR analyses revealed a significantly reduced Pcdh15 mRNA level in the brain of mutant mice, which might be due to the mechanism of non-sense mediated decay.In man, mutations in the orthologue PCDH15 cause non-syndromic deafness and Usher Syndrome Type 1F, a genetic disorder characterized by hearing loss and retinitis pigmentosa. Rodador mouse constitutes a new model for studying deafness in these conditions and may help in the comprehension of the pathogeneses of the disease, as well as of the mechanisms involved in the morphogenesis and function of inner ear stereocilia. This is a new ENU-induced allele and the first isolated in a BALB/c background.",

We observed more cell death for MNCs of group I than group II. Concordantly, group I CD34+ cells had a very low potential for hematopoietic colony formation in vitro compared with group II cells. CD34+ cells of group II showed an unexpectedly higher level of mtDNA sequence heterogeneity than was present in group I cells. These observations suggest that reduced mtDNA sequence heterogeneity in single CD34+ cells of group I was likely due to elimination of cells harboring mutations.

A single intraperitoneal treatment of adult male and female Swiss mice (strain H) with AuNPs, at a dose of 3.3\u00a0mg/kg body weight, had no effect on the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MN PCEs) in bone marrow.

Among the different DNA repair pathways, nucleotide excision repair (NER) is one of the most versatile, as it can eliminate a wide range of helix-distorting DNA lesions caused by ultraviolet light irradiation and chemical mutagens. We performed a genotype\u2013phenotype correlation study in 122 healthy subjects in order to assess if any associations exist between phenotypic profiles of NER and DNA repair gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Individuals were genotyped for 768 SNPs with a custom Illumina Golden Gate Assay, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the same subjects were tested for a NER comet assay to measure DRC after challenging cells by benzo(a)pyrene diolepoxide (BPDE).We observed a large inter-individual variability of NER capacity, with women showing a statistically significant lower DRC (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 6.68\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.76; p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) than men (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD: 8.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.20). Moreover, DRC was significantly lower in individuals carrying a variant allele for the ERCC4 rs1800124 non-synonymous SNP (nsSNP) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and significantly higher in subjects with the variant allele of MBD4 rs2005618 SNP (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), in linkage disequilibrium (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.908) with rs10342 nsSNP.Traditional in silico docking approaches on protein\u2013DNA and protein\u2013protein interaction showed that Gly875 variant in ERCC4 (rs1800124) decreases the DNA\u2013protein interaction and that Ser273 and Thr273 variants in MBD4 (rs10342) indicate complete loss of protein\u2013DNA interactions.

     "abstract": "Genetic information is recorded in specific DNA sequences that must be protected to preserve normal cellular function. Genome maintenance pathways have evolved to sense and repair DNA damage. Importantly, deleterious mutations that occur from mis-repaired lesions can lead to diseases such as cancer. As eukaryotic DNA is bound by histone proteins and organized into chromatin, the true in vivo substrate of transcription, replication and DNA repair is chromatin. Almost 50 years ago, it was found that histones contained the post-translational modification (PTM), acetylation. With the cloning and identification of transcription associated histone acetyltransferase (HAT) and histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes that write and erase the histone acetylation mark respectively, it was realized that this histone modification could be dynamically regulated. Chromatin is subjected to numerous PTMs that regulate chromatin structure and function, including DNA repair. As different organisms contain different histone modifications, chromatin-associated proteins and chromatin states, it is likely that chromatin-templated processes such as DNA repair will exhibit organismal differences. This article focuses on the DNA damage response (DDR) in mammalian cells and how the concerted activities of HAT and HDAC enzymes, and their histone acetylation targets, specifically participate in DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. Defects in DNA repair and chromatin pathways are observed in cancer, and these pathways represent cancer therapeutic targets. Therefore, understanding the relationship between DNA repair and histone acetylations is important for providing mechanistic details of DSB repair within chromatin that has the potential to be exploited in the clinic.",

     "abstract": "The protein and DNA complex known as chromatin is a dynamic structure, adapting to alter the spatial arrangement of genetic information within the nucleus to meet the ever changing demands of life. Following decades of research, a dizzying array of regulatory factors is now known to control the architecture of chromatin at nearly every level. Amongst these, ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes play a key role, required for the establishment, maintenance and re-organization of chromatin through their ability to adjust the contact points between DNA and histones, the spacing between individual nucleosomes and the over-arching chromatin superstructure. Utilizing energy from ATP hydrolysis, these enzymes serve as the gatekeepers of genomic access and are essential for transcriptional regulation, DNA replication and cell division. In recent years, a vital role in DNA Double Strand Break (DSB) repair has emerged, particularly within complex chromatin environments such as heterochromatin, or regions undergoing energetic transactions such as transcription or DNA replication. Here, we will provide an overview of what is understood about ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling enzymes in the context of the DNA damage response. We will first touch upon all four major chromatin remodelling enzyme families and then focus chiefly on the nine members of the Chromodomain, Helicase, DNA-binding (CHD) family, particularly CHD3, CHD4, CHD5 and CHD6. These four proteins have established and emerging roles in DNA repair, the oxidative stress response, the maintenance of genomic stability and/or cancer prevention.",

     "abstract": "Cells are equipped with a cell-intrinsic signaling network called the DNA damage response (DDR). This signaling network recognizes DNA lesions and initiates various downstream pathways to coordinate a cell cycle arrest with the repair of the damaged DNA. Alternatively, the DDR can mediate clearance of affected cells that are beyond repair through apoptosis or senescence.The DDR can be activated in response to DNA damage throughout the cell cycle, although the extent of DDR signaling is different in each cell cycle phase. Especially in response to DNA double strand breaks, only a very marginal response was observed during mitosis. Early on it was recognized that cells which are irradiated during mitosis continued division without repairing broken chromosomes. Although these initial observations indicated diminished DNA repair and lack of an acute DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest, insight into the mechanistic re-wiring of DDR signaling during mitosis was only recently provided. Different mechanisms appear to be at play to inactivate specific signaling axes of the DDR network in mitosis. Importantly, mitotic cells not simply inactivate the entire DDR, but appear to mark their DNA damage for repair after mitotic exit.Since the treatment of cancer frequently involves agents that induce DNA damage as well as agents that block mitotic progression, it is clinically relevant to obtain a better understanding of how cancer cells deal with DNA damage during interphase versus mitosis. In this review, the molecular details concerning DDR signaling during mitosis as well as the consequences of encountering DNA damage during mitosis for cellular fate are discussed.",

While much is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in DSB repair and checkpoint activation, the roles of nuclear dynamics of radiation-induced foci (RIF) in DNA repair are just beginning to emerge.

We also discuss how nuclear architecture and chromatin components might control these dynamics, and the need of novel quantification methods for a better description and interpretation of these phenomena. These studies are expected to provide new biomarkers for radiation risk and new strategies for cancer detection and treatment.",

Although during the last years many disease-modifying agents as treatment options for multiple sclerosis have been made available, their mechanisms of action are still not fully determined. In the present study radiosensitivity in lymphocytes of patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis, secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and healthy controls was investigated. Whole blood cultures from multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls were used to analyze the spontaneous and radiation-induced micronuclei in binucleated lymphocytes. A subgroup of patients with relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis was treated with immunomodulatory agents, interferon \u03b2 or glatiramer acetate. The secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients group was not receiving any treatment. Our results reveal that the basal DNA damage was not different between relapsing\u2013remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients, and healthy controls. No differences between gamma-irradiation induced micronuclei frequencies in binucleated cells from relapsing\u2013remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients, and healthy controls were found either. Nevertheless, when we compared the radiation induced DNA damage in binucleated cells from healthy individuals with the whole group of patients, a reduction in the frequency of micronuclei was obtained in the patients group. Induced micronuclei yield was significantly lower in the irradiated samples from treated relapsing\u2013remitting multiple sclerosis patients than in healthy controls and relapsing\u2013remitting not treated patients. Intrinsic sensitivity of lymphocytes subpopulations to the apoptotic effect of immunomodulatory treatment could be responsible for this result.",

Following transformation with the plasmid containing bi-stranded clustered damage sites into the wild type strain of Escherichia coli, transformation frequencies were significantly lower for the bi-stranded clustered GAP/AP lesions (separated by 1\u00a0bp) than for either a single GAP or a single AP site. When the two lesions were separated by 10\u201320\u00a0bp, the transformation efficiencies were comparable with those of the single lesions. This recovery of transformation efficiency for separated lesions requires DNA polymerase I (Pol I) activity. Analogously, the mutation frequency was found to depend on the distance separating lesions in a bi-stranded cluster containing a GAP and an 8-oxoG, and Pol I was found to play an important role in minimising mutations induced as a result of clustered lesions. The mutagenic potential of 8-oxoG within the bi-stranded lesions does not depend on whether it is situated on the leading or lagging strand. These results indicate that the biological consequences of clustered DNA damage strongly depend on the extent of repair of the strand breaks as well as the DNA polymerase in lesion-avoidance pathways during replication.",

Subsequently, a report appeared indicating that this bacterium maintains an average of about 4.5 genomes per cell. This number of genomes might result in a segregation lag for the expression of a recessive mutation and might therefore lead to an underestimate of the rate of mutation. Here we describe some kinds of problems that may arise when estimating mutation rates and outline ways to adjust the rates accordingly. The emphasis is mainly on differential rates of growth of mutants versus their parents and on various kinds of phenotypic lag. We then apply these methods to the T. thermophilus data and conclude that there is as yet no reliable impact on a previously described rate.",

     "abstract": "Double strand DNA breaks (DSBs) are one of the most challenging forms of DNA damage which, if left unrepaired, can trigger cellular death and can contribute to cancer. A number of studies have been focused on DNA-damage response (DDR) mechanisms, and most of them rely on the induction of DSBs triggered by chemical compounds or radiations. However, genotoxic drugs and radiation treatments of cultured cell lines induce random DSBs throughout the genome, thus heterogeneously across the cell population, leading to variability of the cellular response. To overcome this aspect, we used here a recently described cell-based DSBs system whereby, upon induction of an inducible restriction enzyme, hundreds of site-specific DSBs are generated across the genome. We show here that sequence-specific DSBs are sufficient to activate the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), to trigger hyperphosphorylation of the largest RNA polymerase II carboxyl-terminal-domain (Rpb1-CTD) and to induce activation of p53-transcriptional axis resulting in cell cycle arrest.",

The objective of the present study was to investigate dietary nicotinamide enrichment dependent adaptive response to potential cytotoxic effect of 60Co \u03b3-radiation. To elucidate the possible underlying mechanism(s), male Swiss mice were maintained on control diet (CD) and nicotinamide supplemented diet (NSD). After 6 weeks of CD and NSD dietary regimen, we exposed the animals to \u03b3-radiation (2, 4 and 6\u00a0Gy) and investigated the profile of downstream metabolites and activities of enzymes involved in NAD+ biosynthesis. Increased activities of nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) were observed up to 48\u00a0h post-irradiation in NSD fed irradiated mice. Concomitant with increase in liver NAMPT and NMNAT activities, NAD+ levels were replenished in NSD fed and irradiated animals. However, NAMPT and NMNAT-mediated NAD+ biosynthesis and ATP levels were severely compromised in liver of CD fed irradiated mice. Another major finding of these studies revealed that under \u03b3-radiation stress, dietary nicotinamide supplementation might induce higher and long-lasting poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) activities in NSD fed animals compared to CD fed animals. To investigate liver DNA damage, number of apurinic/apyrimidinic sites (AP sites) and level of 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) residues were quantified. A significant increase in liver DNA AP sites and 8-oxo-dG levels with concomitant increase in caspase-3 was observed in CD fed and irradiated animals compared to NSD fed and irradiated mice. In conclusion present studies show that under \u03b3-radiation stress conditions, dietary nicotinamide supplementation restores DNA excision repair activity via prolonged activation of PARP1 and PARG activities. Present results clearly indicated that hepatic NAD+ replenishment might be a novel and potent approach to reduce radiation injury.",

     "abstract": "Aneuploidy is a change in the number of chromosomes and an essential component in tumorigenesis. Therefore, accurate and sensitive detection of aneuploidy is important in screening for carcinogens. In vitro micronucleus (MN) assay has been adopted in the recently revised International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) S2 guideline and can be employed to predict both clastogenic and aneugenic chromosomal aberrations in interphase cells. However, distinguishing clastogens and aneugens is not possible using this assay. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guideline TG487 therefore recommends the use of centromere/kinetochore staining in micronuclei to differentiate clastogens from aneugens. Here, we analyzed numerical changes of a specific chromosome in cytokinesis-blocked binucleated cells by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the specific centromere probe in human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells treated with aneugens (colcemid and vincristine) or clastogens (methyl methanesulfonate [MMS] and 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide [4-NQO]). Colcemid and vincristine significantly increased the frequencies of nondisjunction and loss of FISH signals, while MMS and 4-NQO slightly increased only the frequency of loss of FISH signals. The loss of FISH signals of a specific chromosome from two to one per nucleus implies either a loss of a whole chromosome or an overlap of two signals. To distinguish a chromosome loss from signal overlap, we investigated the number of FISH signals and the fluorescent intensity of each signal per nucleus using a probe specific for whole chromosome 2 in binucleated TK6 cells and primary human lymphocytes treated with colcemid and MMS. By discriminating between chromosome loss and FISH signal overlap, we revealed that colcemid, but not MMS, induced a loss of a whole chromosome in primary lymphocytes and TK6 cells.",

Furthermore, the PIG-A-null phenotype is readily detected by flow cytometry. Using PIG-A, we have now provided the first in vitro measurement of \u03bc in myeloid cells, using cultures of CD34+ cells that are transduced with either the AML-ETO or the MLL-AF9 fusion genes and expanded with cytokines.

In contrast, few spontaneous mutations were observed in the MLL-AF9 cultures. Knockdown of p53 or introduction of mutant NRAS or FLT3 alleles did not have much of an effect on \u03bc.

     "abstract": "Cigarette smoke causes direct oxidative DNA damage as well as indirect damage through inflammation. Epidemiological studies show a strong relationship between secondhand smoke and cancer; however, the mechanisms of secondhand smoke-induced cancer are not well understood. Animal models with either (i) deficient oxidative DNA damage repair, or (ii) a decreased capacity to combat oxidative stress may help determine the pathways important in mitigating damage caused by smoke. In this study, we used mice lacking Ogg1 and Myh, both of which are involved in base excision repair by removing oxidatively damaged DNA bases. Gclm-deficient mice, which have decreased levels of glutathione (GSH), were used to look at the role of smoke-induced oxidative damage. Ex vivo experiments show significantly elevated levels of DNA single-strand breaks and chromosomal aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes from Ogg1\u2212/\u2212Myh\u2212/\u2212 double knockout mice compared to wild type (WT) mice after 24\u00a0h of exposure to cigarette smoke extract (CSE).

Ogg1\u2212/\u2212Myh\u2212/\u2212 and Gclm\u2212/\u2212 mice had altered levels of peripheral blood glutathione after SSTS exposure whereas wild type mice did not. This may be due to differential regulation of glutathione synthesis in the lung.

However, in such studies it is not always possible to collect and process samples on the same day as the blood is taken.We performed a genotype\u2013phenotype correlation study on DRC on 225 healthy subjects. Due to the large number of blood samples to be processed, PBMCs were either isolated and cryopreserved on the same day of blood collection (day 1) or on the following day after 24\u00a0h blood storage at room temperature (day 2-RT).

Three blood samples were simultaneously taken from ten healthy donors, PBMCs were isolated and cryopreserved as follows: immediately after blood collection (day 1); on the following day, after blood storage at RT (day 2-RT); or after blood storage at 4\u00a0\u00b0C (day 2-4\u00a0\u00b0C).

Pediatric records were abstracted for respiratory illnesses. Second-hand tobacco smoke exposure from household members was obtained through questionnaires and verified using urine cotinine. Air monitoring provided estimates of ambient polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and PM2.5.

The iron chelator 2,2\u2032-dipyridyl eliminated killing by streptomycin, but further investigation revealed that it blocks streptomycin uptake.

     "abstract": "Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released from dying cells contains a substantial proportion of oxidized nucleotides, thus, forming cfDNAOX. The levels of cfDNAOX are increased in the serum of patients with chronic diseases. Oxidation of DNA turns it into a stress signal. The samples of genomic DNA (gDNA) oxidized by \u041d2\u041e2in vitro (gDNAOX) induce effects similar to that of DNA released from damaged cells. Here we describe the effects of gDNAOX on human fibroblasts cultivated in the stressful conditions of serum withdrawal. In these cells, gDNAOX evokes an adaptive response that leads to an increase in the rates of survival in serum starving cell populations as well as in populations irradiated at the dose of 1.2\u00a0Gy. These effects are not seen in control populations of fibroblasts treated with non-modified gDNA. In particular, the exposure to gDNAOX leads to a decrease in the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 and an increase in levels of \u0420\u0421N\u0410, a decrease in the proportion of subG1- and G2/M cells, a decrease in proportion of cells with double strand breaks (DSBs). Both gDNAOX and gDNA suppress the expression of DNA sensors TLR9 and AIM2 and up-regulate nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 (NRF2), while only gDNAOX inhibits NF-\u03baB signaling. gDNAOX is a model for oxidized cfDNAOX that is released from the dying tumor cells and being carried to the distant organs.

In particular, the damaged DNA released from irradiated cells may be responsible for an abscopal effects and a bystander mediated adaptive response seen in some cancer patients. These results indicate the necessity for the further study of the effects of oxidized DNA in both in vitro and in vivo systems.",

     "abstract": "Human DNA mismatch repair (MMR) recognizes and binds 5-fluorouracil (5FU) incorporated into DNA and triggers a MMR-dependent cell death. Absence of MMR in a patient's colorectal tumor abrogates 5FU's beneficial effects on survival. Changes in the tumor microenvironment like low extracellular pH (pHe) may diminish DNA repair, increasing genomic instability. Here, we explored if low pHe modifies MMR recognition of 5FU, as 5FU can exist in ionized and non-ionized forms depending on pH. We demonstrate that MMR-proficient cells at low pHe show downregulation of hMLH1, whereas expression of TDG and MBD4, known DNA glycosylases for base excision repair (BER) that can remove 5FU from DNA, were unchanged. We show in vitro that 5FU within DNA pairs with adenine (A) at high and low pH (in absence of MMR and BER). Surprisingly, 5FdU:G was repaired to C:G in hMLH1-deficient cells cultured at both low and normal pHe, similar to MMR-proficient cells. Moreover, both hMSH6 and hMSH3, components of hMutS\u03b1 and hMutS\u03b2, respectively, bound 5FU within DNA (hMSH6\u00a0>\u00a0hMSH3) but is influenced by hMLH1. We conclude that an acidic tumor microenvironment triggers downregulation of hMLH1, potentially removing the execution component of MMR for 5FU cytotoxicity, whereas other mechanisms remain stable to implement overall 5FU sensitivity.",

     "abstract": "Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is a well known mutagen and carcinogen. Since genomic instability due to generation of double strand breaks (DSBs) is causally linked to carcinogenesis, we tested a hypothesis that Cr(VI) causes in vivo generation of DSBs and elicits DNA damage response. We fed repair proficient Drosophila melanogaster (Oregon R+) larvae Cr(VI) (20.0\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) mixed food for 24 and 48\u00a0h and observed a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) induction of DSBs in their midgut cells after 48\u00a0h using neutral Comet assay. Global gene expression profiling in Cr(VI)-exposed Oregon R+ larvae unveiled mis-regulation of DSBs responsive repair genes both after 24 and 48\u00a0h. In vivo generation of DSBs in exposed Drosophila was confirmed by an increased pH2Av immunostaining along with the activation of cell cycle regulation genes. Analysis of mis-regulated genes grouped under DSB response by GOEAST indicated the participation of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) DSB repair pathway. We selected two strains, one mutant (ligIV) and another ku80-RNAi (knockdown of ku80), whose functions are essentially linked to NHEJ-DSB repair pathway. As a proof of principle, we compared the DSBs generation in larvae of these two strains with that of repair proficient Oregon R+. Along with this, DSBs generation in spn-A and okr [essential genes in homologous recombination repair (HR) pathway] mutants was also tested for the possible involvement of HR-DSB repair. A significantly increased DSBs generation in the exposed ku80-RNAi and ligIV (mutant) larvae because of impaired repair, concomitant with an insignificant DSBs generation in okr and spn-A mutant larvae indicates an active participation of NHEJ repair pathway. The study, first of its kind to our knowledge, while providing evidences for in vivo generation of DSBs in Cr(VI) exposed Drosophila larvae, assumes significance for its relevance to higher organisms due to causal link between DSB generation and Cr(VI)-induced carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative damage has been implicated in the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). The base excision repair (BER) pathway is the major DNA repair pathway for oxidative DNA damage and genetic variation associated with impaired BER might thus increase a risk of CRC. In this work, we evaluated associations between the repair efficiency of oxidative DNA lesions and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of BER genes: the 194Trp/Arg and the 399Arg/Gln XRCC1, the 326Ser/Cys OGG1 and the 324Gln/His MUTYH and CRC occurrence in a Polish population. These polymorphisms were genotyped in 182 CRC patients and 245 control subjects, using a PCR-RFLP approach. The level of oxidative damage and DNA repair capacity in lymphocytes and CRC tissue samples was evaluated by comet assay using FPG and Nth glycosidases. The 326Ser/Cys OGG1 and the 324Gln/His as well as the 324His/His MUTYH genotypes were found to be associated with an increased CRC risk, while no association was found for the XRCC1 gene polymorphisms. It was also demonstrated the reduced capacity of oxidative damage repair in CRC patients in comparison to healthy controls. Moreover, the decrease efficiency of DNA repair were correlated with the 399Gln/Gln XRCC1 and the 324His/His MUTYH genotypes occurrence in CRC patients. The results obtained in our study indicated an association of OGG1 and MUTYH genes polymorphisms involved in oxidative DNA lesions repair with the risk occurrence of colorectal cancer in Polish patients. It was also found that studied polymorphisms might affect DNA repair capacity suggesting their role in CRC pathogenesis. Finally, we conclude that BER pathway may be an important target for the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal patients.",

As a consequence of deleting NHEJ, Ku80-mutant cells are hypersensitive to agents that cause DNA DSBs like ionizing radiation. Here we show that Ku80 deletion also decreased resistance to ROS and alkylating agents that typically cause base lesions and single-strand breaks (SSBs). This is unusual since base excision repair (BER), not NHEJ, typically repairs these types of lesions. However, we show that deletion of another NHEJ protein, DNA ligase IV (Lig4), did not cause hypersensitivity to these agents. In addition, the ROS and alkylating agents did not induce \u03b3-H2AX foci that are diagnostic of DSBs. Furthermore, deletion of Ku80, but not Lig4 or Ku70, reduced BER capacity. Ku80 deletion also impaired BER at the initial lesion recognition/strand scission step; thus, involvement of a DSB is unlikely. Therefore, our data suggests that Ku80 deletion impairs BER via a mechanism that does not repair DSBs.",

Zebrafish embryos at 8 hpf were divided into seven groups: the control group; the 1\u00a0Gy, 3\u00a0Gy and 7\u00a0Gy irradiation groups; and three FA-pre-treated irradiation groups. In the irradiated groups, a significant increase in the teratogenesis of the zebrafish embryos and oxidative stress was accompanied by increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content, decreased glutathione (GSH) content and alterations in antioxidant enzyme activities (such as catalase [CAT] and superoxide dismutase [SOD]). Moreover, the mRNA levels for Cu/Zn\u2013sod, Mn\u2013sod, cat and gpx, the genes encoding these antioxidant proteins, were altered significantly. However, the mRNA expression patterns were not in accordance with those of the antioxidant enzymes and were more sensitive under low-dose irradiation. In addition, we detected the mRNA expression of ucp-2 and bcl-2, which are located at the mitochondrial inner membrane and related to reactive oxidative species (ROS) production. In the irradiated groups, the mRNA level of ucp-2 was significantly increased, whereas the mRNA level of bcl-2 was significantly decreased. Supplementation with FA, an antioxidant, was better able to reduce the irradiation-induced oxidative damage marked by changes in mortality, morphology, antioxidant enzyme activities and the MDA and GSH content, as well as in the mRNA expression levels. Overall, this study provided helpful information about the transcriptional effects of irradiation to better understand the mechanism of carbon ion-induced oxidative stress and FA-induced radioprotective effects.",

     "abstract": "Hyperinsulinemia, the medical term for elevated insulin blood levels, is characteristic for several diseases such as diabetes mellitus, obesity and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Studies reported a direct relationship between hyperinsulinemia and cancer risk, especially for colon cancer. In the present work we investigated for the first time the ability of pathophysiological concentrations of insulin to induce DNA damage in colon cells and human peripheral lymphocytes through the overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT29) showed significant elevation of DNA damage using comet assay, FPG modified comet assay and micronucleus frequency analysis upon treatment with 5\u00a0nM insulin in standard protocols. Extension of the treatment to 6 days lowered the concentration needed to reach significance to 0.5\u00a0nM. Insulin enhanced the cellular ROS production as examined by the oxidation of the dyes 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) and dihydroethidium (DHE). The radical scavenger tempol protected the cells. To investigate the sources of ROS upon insulin stimulation, apocynin and VAS2870 as NADPH oxidase inhibitors and rotenone as mitochondrial inhibitor were applied in combination with insulin, all of them leading to a reduction of the genomic damage. Studies in another human colon cancer cell line, Caco-2, rat primary colon cells and peripheral human lymphocytes treated in vitro all confirmed the effect of insulin on cellular chromatin. We conclude that pathophysiological levels of insulin can cause DNA damage, which may contribute to the induction or progression of colon cancer. Antioxidants as well as mitochondrial and NADPH oxidase inhibitors may have a cancer preventive potential under certain conditions.",

Transcription was analysed by three methods, High Coverage Expression Profiling (HiCEP), Illumina microarrays and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR). A pilot HiCEP experiment with 6 exposed (E) and 6 non-exposed (NE) mice identified four candidate responsive transcripts (two unknown transcripts (AK152075 and F10-NED), phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (Picalm) and exportin 7 (Xpo7)). A larger experiment compared 19 E and 15 NE mice using two independent QRT-PCR assays and repeated microarray assays. No significant field-dependent changes were seen, although Picalm showed a trend to significance in one QRT-PCR assay (E/NE\u00a0=\u00a00.91; P\u00a0=\u00a00.06). However, the study was underpowered to detect an effect of this magnitude (52% power at P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). These data indicate the current experimental constraints in detecting small changes in transcription that may occur in response to magnetic fields.

There is evidence this is also the case for the oxidative lesion 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG). Both of these lesions cause moderate to severe blockage of synthesis when encountered by replicative polymerases, while pol \u03b7 displays little no to pausing during translesion synthesis. However, since lesion bypass does not remove damaged DNA from the genome and can possibly be accompanied by errors in synthesis during bypass, the process is often called \u2018damage tolerance\u2019 to delineate it from classical DNA repair pathways. The fidelity of lesion bypass is therefore of importance when determining how pol \u03b7 suppresses mutations after DNA damage. As pol \u03b7 has been implicated in numerous in vivo pathways other than lesion bypass, we wanted to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the relatively low-fidelity synthesis displayed by pol \u03b7. To that end, we have created a set of mutant pol \u03b7 proteins each containing a single amino acid substitution in the active site and closely surrounding regions. We determined overall DNA synthesis ability as well as the efficiency and fidelity of bypass of thymine\u2013thymine CPD (T\u2013T CPD) and 8-oxoG containing DNA templates. Our results show that several amino acids are critical for normal polymerase function, with changes in overall activity and fidelity being observed. Of the mutants that retain polymerase activity, we demonstrate that amino acids Q38, Y52, and R61 play key roles in determining polymerase fidelity, with substation of alanine causing both increases and decreases in fidelity. Remarkably, the Q38A mutant displays increased fidelity during synthesis opposite 8-oxoG but decreased fidelity during synthesis opposite a T\u2013T CPD.",

This pathway is initiated by one of several DNA glycosylases that recognizes and excises specific DNA lesions in a coordinated fashion. Methyl-CpG Domain Protein 4 (MBD4) and Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) are the two major G:T glycosylases that remove thymine generated by the deamination of 5-methylcytosine. Both of these glycosylases also remove a variety of other base lesions, including G:U and preferentially act at CpG sites throughout the genome. Many have questioned the purpose of seemingly redundant glycosylases, but new information has emerged to suggest MBD4 and TDG have diverse biological functions. MBD4 has been closely linked to apoptosis, while TDG has been clearly implicated in transcriptional regulation. This article reviews all of these developments, and discusses the consequences of germline and somatic mutations that lead to non-synonymous amino acid substitutions on MBD4 and TDG protein function.

UNG and SMUG1 are the two human UDGs most likely to combat the genomic incorporation of uracil and 5-FU during replication. In this study, we examined the roles of UNG and SMUG1 in the initial cellular response to 5-FU and compared continuous exposure to a 24\u00a0h exposure followed by incubation in drug-free media, which mimics what occurs clinically. Loss of UNG did not alter cellular sensitivity to 5-FU in two human cell lines, despite its predominant biochemical activity for uracil and 5-FU in DNA. Loss of SMUG1 corresponded with >2-fold increase in sensitivity to 5-FU, but only with a 24\u00a0h treatment followed by recovery. There was no difference between SMUG1 proficient and depleted cells following continuous exposure. We observed that 5-FU treatment induced an enhanced S-phase arrest and CHK1 activation plus an increase in the formation of strand breaks and alkali-labile sites in all sublines. However, SMUG1-depleted cells showed a prolonged S-phase arrest, a transient increase in DNA double-strand breaks following 5-FU treatment and an altered phosphorylation of CHK1 following removal of drug. Collectively, the results suggest that SMUG1 has a role in the resumption of replication following 5-FU treatment.",

     "abstract": "MUTYH, a human ortholog of MutY, is a post-replicative DNA glycosylase, highly conserved throughout evolution, involved in the correction of mismatches resulting from a faulty replication of the oxidized base 8-hydroxyguanine (8-oxodG). In particular removal of adenine from A:8-oxodG mispairs by MUTYH activity is followed by error-free base excision repair (BER) events, leading to the formation of C:8-oxodG base pairs. These are the substrate of another BER enzyme, the OGG1 DNA glycosylase, which then removes 8-oxodG from DNA. Thus the combined action of OGG1 and MUTYH prevents oxidative damage-induced mutations, i.e. GC-\u00a0>\u00a0TA transversions. Germline mutations in MUTYH are associated with a recessively heritable colorectal polyposis, now referred to as MUTYH-associated polyposis (MAP). Here we will review the phenotype(s) associated with MUTYH inactivation from bacteria to mammals, the structure of the MUTYH protein, the molecular mechanisms of its enzymatic activity and the functional characterization of MUTYH variants. The relevance of these results will be discussed to define the role of specific human mutations in colorectal cancer risk together with the possible role of MUTYH inactivation in sporadic cancer.",

Concerted action of repair proteins involved in Nucleotide Excision Repair and Homologous Recombination pathways are suggested to play a key role in the ICL repair. However, recent studies indicate a possible role for Base Excision Repair (BER) in mediating the cytotoxicity of ICL inducing agents in mammalian cells. Elucidating the mechanism of BER mediated modulation of ICL repair would help in understanding the recognition and removal of ICLs and aid in the development of potential therapeutic agents.

     "abstract": "The field of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has rapidly expanded after the discovery of the MutHLS repair system in bacteria. By the mid 1990s yeast and human homologues to bacterial MutL and MutS had been identified and their contribution to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC; Lynch syndrome) was under intense investigation. The human MutS homologue 6 protein (hMSH6), was first reported in 1995 as a G:T binding partner (GTBP) of hMSH2, forming the hMutS\u03b1 mismatch-binding complex. Signal transduction from each DNA-bound hMutS\u03b1 complex is accomplished by the hMutL\u03b1 heterodimer (hMLH1 and hPMS2). Molecular mechanisms and cellular regulation of individual MMR proteins are now areas of intensive research. This review will focus on molecular mechanisms associated with mismatch binding, as well as emerging evidence that MutS\u03b1, and in particular, MSH6, is a key protein in MMR-dependent DNA damage response and communication with other DNA repair pathways within the cell. MSH6 is unstable in the absence of MSH2, however it is the DNA lesion-binding partner of this heterodimer. MSH6, but not MSH2, has a conserved Phe-X-Glu motif that recognizes and binds several different DNA structural distortions, initiating different cellular responses. hMSH6 also contains the nuclear localization sequences required to shuttle hMutS\u03b1 into the nucleus. For example, upon binding to O6meG:T, MSH6 triggers a DNA damage response that involves altered phosphorylation within the N-terminal disordered domain of this unique protein. While many investigations have focused on MMR as a post-replication DNA repair mechanism, MMR proteins are expressed and active in all phases of the cell cycle. There is much more to be discovered about regulatory cellular roles that require the presence of MutS\u03b1 and, in particular, MSH6.",

     "abstract": "Microsatellite DNA sequences display allele length alterations or microsatellite instability (MSI) in tumor tissues, and MSI is used diagnostically for tumor detection and classification. We discuss the known types of tumor-specific MSI patterns and the relevant mechanisms underlying each pattern. Mutation rates of individual microsatellites vary greatly, and the intrinsic DNA features of motif size, sequence, and length contribute to this variation. MSI is used for detecting mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient tumors, which display an MSI-high phenotype due to genome-wide microsatellite destabilization. Because several pathways maintain microsatellite stability, tumors that have undergone other events associated with moderate genome instability may display diagnostic MSI only at specific di- or tetranucleotide markers. We summarize evidence for such alternative MSI forms (A-MSI) in sporadic cancers, also referred to as MSI-low and EMAST. While the existence of A-MSI is not disputed, there is disagreement about the origin and pathologic significance of this phenomenon. Although ambiguities due to PCR methods may be a source, evidence exists for other mechanisms to explain tumor-specific A-MSI. Some portion of A-MSI tumors may result from random mutational events arising during neoplastic cell evolution. However, this mechanism fails to explain the specificity of A-MSI for di- and tetranucleotide instability. We present evidence supporting the alternative argument that some A-MSI tumors arise by a distinct genetic pathway, and give examples of DNA metabolic pathways that, when altered, may be responsible for instability at specific microsatellite motifs. Finally, we suggest that A-MSI in tumors could be molecular signatures of environmental influences and DNA damage. Importantly, A-MSI occurs in several pre-neoplastic inflammatory states, including inflammatory bowel diseases, consistent with a role of oxidative stress in A-MSI. Understanding the biochemical basis of A-MSI tumor phenotypes will advance the development of new diagnostic tools and positively impact the clinical management of individual cancers.",

     "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare inherited recessive disease caused by mutations in one of fifteen genes known to encode FA pathway components. In response to DNA damage, nuclear FA proteins associate into high molecular weight complexes through a cascade of post-translational modifications and physical interactions, followed by the repair of damaged DNA. Hematopoietic cells are particularly sensitive to the loss of these interactions, and bone marrow failure occurs almost universally in FA patients. FA as a disease is further characterized by cancer susceptibility, which highlights the importance of the FA pathway in tumor suppression, and will be the focus of this review. Acute myeloid leukemia is the most common cancer type, often subsequent to bone marrow failure. However, FA patients are also at an extreme risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the head and neck and gynecological tract, with an even greater incidence in those individuals who have received a bone marrow transplant and recovered from hematopoietic disease. FA tumor suppression in hematopoietic versus epithelial compartments could be mechanistically similar or distinct. Definition of compartment specific FA activities is now critical to assess the effects of today's bone marrow failure treatments on tomorrow's solid tumor development. It is our hope that current therapies can then be optimized to decrease the risk of malignant transformation in both hematopoietic and epithelial cells. Here we review our current understanding of the mechanisms of action of the Fanconi anemia pathway as it contributes to stress responses, DNA repair and squamous cell carcinoma susceptibility.",

It is characterized clinically by severe growth retardation and cancer predisposition. BLM localizes to PML nuclear bodies and to the nucleolus; its deficiency results in increased intra- and inter-chromosomal recombination, including hyper-recombination of rDNA repeats. Our previous work has shown that BLM facilitates RNA polymerase I-mediated rRNA transcription in the nucleolus (Grierson et al., 2012 [18]). This study uses protein co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro transcription/translation (IVTT) to identify a direct interaction of DNA topoisomerase I with the C-terminus of BLM in the nucleolus. In vitro helicase assays demonstrate that DNA topoisomerase I stimulates BLM helicase activity on a nucleolar-relevant RNA:DNA hybrid, but has an insignificant effect on BLM helicase activity on a control DNA:DNA duplex substrate. Reciprocally, BLM enhances the DNA relaxation activity of DNA topoisomerase I on supercoiled DNA substrates. Our study suggests that BLM and DNA topoisomerase I function coordinately to modulate RNA:DNA hybrid formation as well as relaxation of DNA supercoils in the context of nucleolar transcription.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells display numerous abnormal characteristics which are initiated and maintained by elevated mutation rates and genome instability. Chromosomal DNA is continuously surveyed for the presence of damage or blocked replication forks by the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. The DDR is complex and includes activation of cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, gene transcription, and induction of apoptosis. Duplicating a damaged genome is associated with elevated risks to fork collapse and genome instability. Therefore, the DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathway is also employed to enhance survival and involves the recruitment of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymerases to sites of replication fork blockade or single stranded DNA gaps left after the completion of replication in order to restore DNA to its double stranded form before mitosis. TLS polymerases are specialized for inserting nucleotides opposite DNA adducts, abasic sites, or DNA crosslinks. By definition, the DDT pathway is not involved in the actual repair of damaged DNA, but provides a mechanism to tolerate DNA lesions during replication thereby increasing survival and lessening the chance for genome instability. However this may be associated with increased mutagenesis. In this review, we will describe the specialized functions of Y family polymerases (Rev1, Pol\u03b7, Pol\u03b9 and Pol\u03ba) and DNA polymerase \u03b6 in lesion bypass, mutagenesis, and prevention of genome instability, the latter due to newly appreciated roles in DNA repair.

Small-sized CNVs can act as initial genetic changes giving rise to larger CNVs such as acquired somatic copy number aberrations (CNAs) promoting cancer formation. Previous studies provided evidence for CNVs as an underlying cause of elevated breast cancer risk when targeting breast cancer susceptibility genes and of accelerated breast cancer progression when targeting oncogenes. With the development of novel techniques for genome-wide detection of CNVs at increasingly higher resolution, it became possible to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse manifestation of DNA damage resulting from defects in any of the large variety of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair mechanisms. Breast carcinogenesis, particularly in familial cases, has been linked with a defect in the homologous recombination (HR) pathway, which in turn switches damage removal towards alternative, more error-prone DSB repair pathways such as microhomology-mediated non-homologous end joining (mmNHEJ). Indeed, increased error-prone DSB repair activities were detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes from individuals with familial breast cancer risk independently of specific gene mutations. Intriguingly, sequence analysis of breakpoint regions revealed that the majority of genome aberrations found in breast cancer specimens are formed by mmNHEJ. Detection of pathway-specific error-prone DSB repair activities by functional testing was proposed to serve as biomarker for hereditary breast cancer risk and responsiveness to therapies targeting HR dysfunction. Identification of specific error-prone DSB repair mechanisms underlying CNAs and ultimately mammary tumour formation highlights potential targets for future breast cancer prevention regimens.",

     "abstract": "Telomeres protect chromosome termini to maintain genomic stability and regulate cellular lifespan. Maintenance of telomere length is required for neoplastic cells after the acquisition of mutations that deregulate cell cycle control and increase cellular proliferation, and can occur through expression of the enzyme telomerase or in a telomerase-independent manner termed alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). The precise mechanisms that govern the activation of ALT or telomerase in tumor cells are unknown, although cellular origin may favor one or the other mechanisms. ALT pathways are incompletely understood to date; however, recent publications have increasingly broadened our understanding of how ALT is activated, how it proceeds, and how it influences tumor growth. Specific mutational events influence ALT activation, as mutations in genes that suppress recombination and/or alterations in the regulation of telomerase expression are associated with ALT. Once engaged, ALT uses DNA repair proteins to maintain telomeres in the absence of telomerase; experiments that manipulate the expression of specific proteins in cells using ALT are illuminating some of its mechanisms. Furthermore, ALT may influence tumor growth, as experimental and clinical data suggest that telomerase expression may favor tumor progression. This review summarizes recent findings in mammalian cells and models, as well as clinical data, that identify the genetic mutations permissive to ALT, the DNA repair proteins involved in ALT mechanisms and the importance of telomere maintenance mechanisms for tumor progression. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that permit tumor cell immortalization will be important for identifying novel therapeutic targets in cancer.",

Zebrafish share many gene functions with other vertebrates including humans, making zebrafish a useful system for studying cancer etiology. However, systematic studies of DNA damage and repair pathways using adult or embryonic zebrafish have not been extensively reported. The zebrafish genome contains nearly all the genes involved in different DNA repair pathways in eukaryotes, including direct reversal (DR), mismatch repair (MMR) nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and translesion synthesis (TLS). It also includes the genes of the p53-mediated damage recognition pathway. Therefore, zebrafish provide an ideal model for gaining fundamental insights into mechanisms of DNA damage and repair, especially during embryological development. This review introduces recent work on different DNA damage and repair studies in zebrafish, with special emphasis on the role of BER in zebrafish early embryological development. AP endonuclease 1 (Apex1), a critical protein in the BER pathway, not only regulates BER but also controls cyclic AMP response binding protein (Creb1), which itself regulates \u223c25% of eukaryotic coding sequences. In addition, Apex1 indirectly regulates levels of p53. As these findings also occur in murine B cells, they illustrate the usefulness of the zebrafish system in elucidating fundamental mechanisms.",

Although activation of adequate DNA damage signaling and repair systems depends on the type of lesion and the cell-cycle phase in which it occurs, emerging evidence indicates that DNA repair and DDR function differently in different cellular contexts. Depending on the time maintenance and function of a specific cell type the risk of accumulating DNA damage may vary. For instance, damage to stem cells if not repaired can lead to mutation amplification or propagation through the processes of self-renewal and differentiation, respectively, whereas damage to post-mitotic cells can affect mostly tissue homeostasis. Stem cells are therefore expected to address DNA damage differently from their somatic counterparts.

Results show that both nucleotide excision repair (NER) and homologous recombination (HR) pathways can process hAGT-DNA crosslinks with HR playing a dominant role.

Further, we found that DPCs at TA deoxynucleotide sites are very inefficiently processed by NER and the presence of NER can interfere with these DNA lesions processed by HR.

     "abstract": "Exposure of male mice to genotoxic agents can increase mutation frequencies in their unexposed descendants. This phenomenon, known as transgenerational genomic instability (TGI), can persist for several generations. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms. Chemically-induced TGI has been demonstrated in non-coding unstable tandem repeat DNA regions, but it is unclear whether it extends to other genetic endpoints. We investigated whether exposure of Muta\u2122Mouse males to a single dose of 75\u00a0mg/kg N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) increased the spontaneous frequency of gene mutations or chromosome damage in their offspring. Treated males were mated with untreated females 3 days, 6 weeks or 10 weeks post-exposure to produce the F1 generation. Offspring were thus conceived from germ cells exposed to ENU as mature spermatozoa, dividing spermatogonia, or spermatogonial stem cells, respectively. F2 mice were generated by mating F1 descendants with untreated partners. Mutations in the lacZ transgene were quantified in bone marrow and micronucleus frequencies were evaluated in red blood cells by flow-cytometry for all F0 and their descendants. LacZ mutant frequencies were also determined in sperm for all exposed males and their male descendants. In F0 males, lacZ mutant frequencies were significantly increased in bone marrow at least 10-fold at all three time points investigated. In sperm, lacZ mutant frequency was significantly increased 7\u201311-fold after exposure of dividing and stem cell spermatogonia, but not in replication-deficient haploid sperm. Micronucleus frequencies assessed two days after ENU treatment were increased 5-fold in F0 males, but returned to control levels after 10 weeks. Despite the strong mutagenic response in F0 males, pre- and post-meiotic ENU exposure did not significantly increase lacZ mutant or micronucleus frequencies in F1 or F2 offspring. These findings suggest that TGI may not extend to all genetic endpoints and that further investigation of this phenomenon and its health relevance will require multiple measures of genomic damage.",

We applied the Infinium Methylation Assay, using the Human Methylation 27K BeadChip with 27,578 CpG loci for identification of the DNA methylation pattern in studied groups.Results demonstrate a significant impact of different environmental conditions on the DNA methylation patterns of children from the two regions. We found 9916 CpG sites with significantly different methylation (beta value) between children from Ostrava vs. Prachatice from which 58 CpG sites had differences >10%. The methylation of all these 58 CpG sites was lower in children from polluted Ostrava, which indicates a higher gene expression in comparison with the control Prachatice region. We did not find a difference in DNA methylation patterns between children with and without bronchial asthma in individual locations, but patterns in both asthmatics and healthy children differed between Ostrava and Prachatice. Further, we show differences in DNA methylation pattern depending on gender and urinary cotinine levels. Other factors including length of gestation, birth weight and length of full breastfeeding are suggested as possible factors that can impact the DNA methylation pattern in future life.",

We demonstrate that CPT-11 treatment activates p38 in exposed cells, however with concentration dependent dynamics and differing consequences. Higher CPT-11 concentrations induce a massive early but relatively short-lasting p38 activity leading to apoptosis mediated by mitochondria and caspases. Pharmacological or siRNA inhibition of p38 then significantly prevents CPT-11-dependent cell death. Conversely, lower CPT-11 concentrations activate p38 in a delayed, however sustained manner, with apoptosis occurring only in a fraction of cells and in the absence of significant autophagy. Blocking p38 in thus treated cells increases their sensitivity toward CPT-11 and increases cell death. In summary, our results confirm the involvement of p38 in colon cancer cells response to CPT-11 while indicating a varying role of p38 in the final biological response.",

     "abstract": "It is known that ionising radiation (IR) induces a complex signalling apoptotic cascade post-exposure to low doses ultimately to remove damaged cells from a population, specifically via the intrinsic pathway. Therefore, it was hypothesised that bystander reporter cells may initiate a similar apoptotic response if exposed to low doses of IR (0.05\u00a0Gy and 0.5\u00a0Gy) and compared to directly irradiated cells. Key apoptotic genes were selected according to their role in the apoptotic cascade; tumour suppressor gene TP53, pro-apoptotic Bax and anti-apoptotic Bcl2, pro-apoptotic JNK and anti-apoptotic ERK, initiator caspase 2 and 9 and effector caspase 3, 6 and 7. The data generated consolidated the role of apoptosis following direct IR exposure for all doses and time points as pro-apoptotic genes such as Bax and JNK as well as initiator caspase 7 and effector caspase 3 and 9 were up-regulated. However, the gene expression profile for the bystander response was quite different and more complex in comparison to the direct response. The 0.05\u00a0Gy dose point had a more significant apoptosis gene expression profile compared to the 0.5\u00a0Gy dose point and genes were not always expressed within 1\u00a0h but were sometimes expressed 24\u00a0h later. The bystander data clearly demonstrates initiation of the apoptotic cascade by the up-regulation of TP53, Bax, Bcl-2, initiator caspase 2 and effector caspase 6. The effector caspases 3 and 7 of the bystander samples demonstrated down-regulation in their gene expression levels at 0.05\u00a0Gy and 0.5\u00a0Gy at both time points therefore not fully executing the apoptotic pathway. Extensive analysis of the mean-fold gene expression changes of bystander data demonstrated that the apoptosis is initiated in the up-regulation of pro-apoptotic and initiator genes but may not very well be executed to final stages of cell death due to down-regulation of effector genes.",

Results showed that the dose\u2013response of MN induced by \u03b3-rays was well-fitted with the linear-quadratic model. But for \u03b1-particle irradiation, the MN induction had a biphasic phenomenon containing a low dose hypersensitivity characteristic and its dose response could be well-stimulated with a state vector model where radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) was involved. For the combination exposure, the dose response of MN was similar to that of \u03b1-irradiation. However, the yield of MN was closely related to the sequence of irradiations. When the cells were irradiated with \u03b1-particles at first and then \u03b3-rays, a synergistic effect of MN induction was observed. But when the cells were irradiated with \u03b3-rays followed by \u03b1-particles, an antagonistic effect of MN was observed in the low dose range although this combination radiation also yielded a synergistic effect at high doses. When the interval between two irradiations was extended to 4\u00a0h, a cross-adaptive response against the other irradiation was induced by a low dose of \u03b3-rays but not \u03b1-particles.",

The in vivo administration of AM after chemotherapy increased SCEs in both cancer types (SCLC: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, NSCLC: p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and this increase was synergistic, the rates of SCEs in the presence of AM were higher than the expected SCE values if the increases above background for chemotherapy and AM were independent and additive (SCLC: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, NSCLC: p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Although in both groups of patients cell division delays were observed after the combined chemotherapy plus in vivo AM treatment, the correlation between the magnitude of the SCE response and the PRI depression was not statistically significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05).These observations suggest that AM enhances the results of concurrently administered chemotherapy by synergistically increasing its cytogenetic effects in patients with lung cancer.",

The features of pathogenic mutations in gene coding regions are still unclear. To explore the pathogenic mutation features of human cancer-related genes, 1227 missense/nonsense mutations from 99 human cancer-related genes were analyzed. We found that the mutability in exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs) is less than that outside ESEs. CpG sites are more enriched in ESEs than outside ESEs. Decrease of mutability in ESEs is much larger than that outside ESEs upon removal of CpG mutations since CpG is more mutable. In addition, the bases in ESEs are prone to undergo C\u2192T/G\u2192A mutations. What is more, mutations in ESEs were preferentially located within 50 nt flanking the short exons (\u2264250 nt), and tend to be of conservative type with minimum effect on the protein structure. Finally, nonsense mutation located in ESEs might be related to Nonsense Mediated Decay (NMD) pathway.

     "abstract": "Many and varied are the proposed mechanisms that lead to resistance to ionizing radiation treatment. Among them, an inverse relationship between telomere length and radioresistance has been recently advanced. Investigating such a relationship in TK6 lymphoblasts, we found that clones originating from cells survived to 4\u00a0Gy of X-rays showed a significantly higher telomere length when compared with clones grown from untreated cells. The lengthening observed was not attributable to a radiation-induced increase in telomerase activity, as demonstrated by TRAP assay performed in the dose range of 1\u201310\u00a0Gy. Given the evidence that TK6 whole population was characterized by heterogeneity in cellular mean telomere length and telomere loss, we tested the hypothesis that a process of selection may favour cells with longer telomeres (more radioresistant cells) following exposure to irradiation. In order to do this 15 independent TK6 clones were selected and characterized for telomere length and loss on the basis of q-FISH and flow-FISH analysis. Among the screened clones four characterized by long telomeres and four characterized by short telomeres were tested for their radiosensitivity by means of clonogenic assay. The results obtained showed that, in our experimental conditions (cellular model, radiation doses) no significant correlation was observed between radiosensitivity and mean telomere lengths, whereas a positive correlation was observed with respect to telomere loss. Overall, these results indicate that telomere loss and not mean telomere length plays a critical role in the phenomenon of radiosensitivity/radioresistance.",

We investigated the effect of antimycin A, a well-known agent inducing oxidative stress, on the stability of mtDNA. We show that antimycin enhances exclusively the generation of respiration-deficient petite mutants and this is accompanied by a significant increase in the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in a marked drop of cellular ATP. Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing revealed that mtDNAs of antimycin-induced petite mutants are deleted for most of the wild-type sequence and usually contain one of the active origins of mtDNA replication: ori1, ori2 ori3 or ori5. We show that the frequency of antimycin-induced rho\u0304 mutants is significantly elevated in mutants deleted either for the RAD50 or XRS2 gene, both encoding the components of the MRX complex, which is known to be involved in the repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) in DNA. Furthermore, enhanced frequency of rho\u0304 mutants in cultures of antimycin-treated cells lacking Rad50 was further increased by the simultaneous absence of the Ogg1 glycosylase, an important enzyme functioning in mtBER. We demonstrate also that rad50\u0394 and xrs2\u0394 deletion mutants display a considerable reduction in the frequency of allelic mitochondrial recombination, suggesting that it is the deficiency in homologous recombination which is responsible for enhanced rearrangements of mtDNA in antimycin-treated cells of these mutants. Finally, we show that the generation of large-scale mtDNA deletions induced by antimycin is markedly decreased in a nuc1\u0394 mutant lacking the activity of the Nuc1 nuclease, an ortholog of the mammalian mitochondrial nucleases EndoG and ExoG.

We used Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFNs) to introduce precise cuts within MLL to examine how a single DNA DSB might lead to chromosomal rearrangements. A ZFN targeting exon 13 within the Breakpoint Cluster Region of MLL was transiently expressed in a human lymphoblast cell line originating from a CML patient. Although FISH analysis showed ZFN DSB at this region increased the rate of MLL fragmentation, we were unable to detect leukemogenic rearrangements or translocations via inverse PCR. Interestingly, gene fragmentation as well as small interstitial deletions, insertions and base substitutions increased with the inhibition of DNA-PK, suggesting repair of this particular DSB is linked to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

In this study, the lethal and mutagenic effects of different linear energy transfer (LET) radiation in freeze-dried conidia of A. oryzae were investigated. The lethal effect, which was evaluated by a 90% lethal dose, was dependent on the LET value of the ionizing radiation. The most lethal ionizing radiation among that tested was 12C5+ ion beams with an LET of 121\u00a0keV/\u03bcm. The 12C5+ ion beams had a 3.6-times higher lethal effect than low-LET (0.2\u00a0keV/\u03bcm) \u03b3-rays. The mutagenic effect was evaluated by the frequency of selenate resistant mutants. 12C6+ ion beams with an LET of 86\u00a0keV/\u03bcm were the most effective in inducing selenate resistance. The mutant frequency following exposure to 12C6+ ion beams increased with an increase in dose and reached 3.47\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123 at 700\u00a0Gy. In the dose range from 0 to 700\u00a0Gy, 12C5+ ion beams were the second most effective in inducing selenate resistance, the mutant frequency of which reached a maximum peak (1.67\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22123) at 400\u00a0Gy. To elucidate the characteristics of mutation induced by ionizing radiation, mutations in the sulphate permease gene (sB) and ATP sulfurylase gene (sC) loci, the loss of function of which results in a selenate resistant phenotype, were compared between 12C5+ ion beams and \u03b3-rays. We detected all types of transversions and transitions. For frameshifts, the frequency of a +1 frameshift was the highest in all cases. Although the incidence of deletions >2\u00a0bp was generally low, deletions >20\u00a0bp were characteristic for 12C5+ ion beams. \u03b3-rays had a tendency to generate mutants carrying a multitude of mutations in the same locus. Both forms of radiation also induced genome-wide large-scale mutations including chromosome rearrangements and large deletions.

Within 30\u00a0min treatment, AOH (30\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, DNA base oxidations as well as DNA strand breaks and/or alkaline labile sites were detected by the comet assay after 2\u00a0h exposure of AOH. Cell death (mostly necrosis) was observed after prolonged exposure to the highest concentration of AOH (60\u00a0\u03bcM for 24 and 48\u00a0h) in our study. The DNA damage response involved phosphorylation (activation) of histone H2AX and check point kinase-1- and 2 (Chk-1/2). Moreover, AOH activated p53 and increased the expression of p21, Cyclin B, MDM2, and Sestrin 2; likewise the level of several miRNA was affected. AOH-induced Sestrin 2 expression was regulated by p53 and could at least partly be inhibited by antioxidants, suggesting a role of ROS in the response.

Although the formation of ROS by itself was not directly linked cell proliferation, AOH-induced DNA damage and resulting transcriptional changes in p21, MDM2, and Cyclin B likely contribute to the reduced cell proliferation; while Sestrin 2 would contribute to the oxidant defense.",

     "abstract": "Radiation-induced liver cell damage may be life-threatening. Here, we investigated whether hydrogen sulfide (H2S)/cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE) pathway could serve the protective role toward radiation in normal human liver cells. Our data showed that pretreatment of cells with H2S donor, sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) significantly attenuated radiation induced micronuclei formation and improved cell viability. However, the use of dl-propargylglycine (PPG), a potent inhibitor of CSE, markedly enhanced the cell-killing effect induced by radiation. Exposure of cells to 2\u00a0Gy \u03b3-radiation led to significant increases of the endogenous H2S content. The mRNA and protein expressions of CSE also increased after radiation in a time-dependent manner, while the expression of cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS), another endogenous H2S synthetase, did not change significantly. Notably, radiation induced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly reversed by the pretreatment of NaHS, while blockage of CSE activity resulted in an enhanced ROS production in irradiated cells. Moreover, NaHS markedly suppressed radiation-induced phosphorylation of P53, decrease of Bcl-2/Bax, and activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-\u03baB). In conclusion, our finding demonstrates that H2S/CSE pathway plays a radioprotection role by inhibiting radiation-induced ROS production, P53 phosphorylation, NF-\u03baB activation and decrease of Bcl-2/Bax, indicating that modulation of H2S may be a novel protection strategy for liver radiation injury in radiotherapy.",

The rats were divided into eight groups of control, irradiation-only, vehicle-only, vehicle plus irradiation, 10\u00a0mg/kg melatonin alone, 10\u00a0mg/kg melatonin plus irradiation, 100\u00a0mg/kg melatonin alone and 100\u00a0mg/kg melatonin plus irradiation. Rats were given an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of melatonin or the same volume of vehicle alone 1\u00a0h prior to irradiation.Blood samples were taken 4, 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h after irradiation for evaluation of flow cytometric analysis of apoptotic lymphocytes using Annexin V/PI assay and measurement of bax and bcl-2 expression using quantitative real-time PCR (RT2qPCR). Irradiation-only and vehicle plus irradiation showed an increase in the percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes significantly different from control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while melatonin pretreatments in a dose-dependent manner reduced it as compared with the irradiation-only and vehicle plus irradiation groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) in all time points. This reduced apoptosis by melatonin was related to the downregulation of bax, upregulation of bcl-2, and therefore reduction of bax/bcl-2 ratio. Our results suggest that melatonin in these doses may provide modulation of bax and bcl-2 expression as well as bax/bcl-2 ratio to protect rat peripheral blood lymphocytes from gamma irradiation-induced apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "In the last years a number of reports have shown that the so-called topoisomerase II (topo II) catalytic inhibitors are able to induce DNA and chromosome damage, an unexpected result taking into account that they do not stabilize topo II-DNA cleavable complexes, a feature of topo II poisons such as etoposide and amsacrine. Merbarone inhibits the catalytic activity of topo II by blocking DNA cleavage by the enzyme. While it was first reported that merbarone does not induce genotoxic effects in mammalian cells, this has been challenged by reports showing that the topo II inhibitor induces efficiently chromosome and DNA damage, and the question as to a possible behavior as a topo II poison has been put forward. Given these contradictory results, and the as yet incomplete knowledge of the molecular mechanism of action of merbarone, in the present study we have tried to further characterize the mechanism of action of merbarone on cell proliferation, cell cycle, as well as chromosome and DNA damage in cultured CHO cells.Merbarone was cytotoxic as well as genotoxic, inhibited topo II catalytic activity, and induced endoreduplication. We have also shown that merbarone-induced DNA damage depends upon ongoing DNA synthesis. Supporting this, inhibition of DNA synthesis causes reduction of DNA damage and increased cell survival.",

     "abstract": "We present studies aimed at determining the types and frequencies of mutations induced in the barley genome after treatment with chemical (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea, MNU) and physical (gamma rays) mutagens. We created M2 populations of a doubled haploid line and used them for the analysis of mutations in targeted DNA sequences and over an entire barley genome using TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes) and AFLP (Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism) technique, respectively. Based on the TILLING analysis of the total DNA sequence of 4,537,117\u00a0bp in the MNU population, the average mutation density was estimated as 1/504\u00a0kb. Only one nucleotide change was found after an analysis of 3,207,444\u00a0bp derived from the highest dose of gamma rays applied. MNU was clearly a more efficient mutagen than gamma rays in inducing point mutations in barley. The majority (63.6%) of the MNU-induced nucleotide changes were transitions, with a similar number of G\u00a0>\u00a0A and C\u00a0>\u00a0T substitutions. The similar share of G\u00a0>\u00a0A and C\u00a0>\u00a0T transitions indicates a lack of bias in the repair of O6-methylguanine lesions between DNA strands. There was, however, a strong specificity of the nucleotide surrounding the O6-meG at the \u22121 position. Purines formed 81% of nucleotides observed at the \u22121 site. Scanning the barley genome with AFLP markers revealed ca. a three times higher level of AFLP polymorphism in MNU-treated as compared to the gamma-irradiated population. In order to check whether AFLP markers can really scan the whole barley genome for mutagen-induced polymorphism, 114 different AFLP products, were cloned and sequenced. 94% of bands were heterogenic, with some bands containing up to 8 different amplicons. The polymorphic AFLP products were characterised in terms of their similarity to the records deposited in a GenBank database. The types of sequences present in the polymorphic bands reflected the organisation of the barley genome.",

The majority of those studied are classical mutagens like radiation and anti-cancer drugs. Very little is known about the dietary variables influencing germline mutation rates. Folate is essential for DNA synthesis and methylation and can impact chromatin structure. We therefore determined the effects of folic acid-deficient (0\u00a0mg/kg), control (2\u00a0mg/kg) and supplemented (6\u00a0mg/kg) diets in early development and during lactation or post-weaning on mutation rates and chromatin quality in sperm of adult male Balb/c mice. The sperm chromatin structure assay and mutation frequencies at expanded simple tandem repeats (ESTRs) were used to evaluate germline DNA integrity. Treatment of a subset of mice fed the control diet with the mutagen ethylnitrosourea (ENU) at 8 weeks of age was included as a positive control. ENU treated mice exhibited decreased cauda sperm counts, increased DNA fragmentation and increased ESTR mutation frequencies relative to non-ENU treated mice fed the control diet. Male mice weaned to the folic acid deficient diet had decreased cauda sperm numbers, increased DNA fragmentation index, and increased ESTR mutation frequency. Folic acid deficiency in early development did not lead to changes in sperm counts or chromatin integrity in adult mice. Folic acid supplementation in early development or post-weaning did not affect germ cell measures. Therefore, adequate folic acid intake in adulthood is important for preventing chromatin damage and mutation in the male germline. Folic acid supplementation at the level achieved in this study does not improve nor is it detrimental to male germline chromatin integrity.",

Most of the knowledge about the mechanisms and control of HR in bacteria has been obtained in fast growing bacteria. However, in their natural environment bacteria frequently meet adverse conditions which restrict the growth of cells. We have constructed a test system to investigate HR between a plasmid and a chromosome in carbon-starved populations of the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida restoring the expression of phenol monooxygenase gene pheA. Our results show that prolonged starvation of P. putida in the presence of phenol stimulates HR. The emergence of recombinants on selective plates containing phenol as an only carbon source for the growth of recombinants is facilitated by reactive oxygen species and suppressed by DNA mismatch repair enzymes. Importantly, the chromosomal location of the HR target influences the frequency and dynamics of HR events. In silico analysis of binding sites of nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs) revealed that chromosomal DNA regions which flank the test system in bacteria exhibiting a lower HR frequency are enriched in binding sites for a subset of NAPs compared to those which express a higher frequency of HR. We hypothesize that the binding of these proteins imposes differences in local structural organization of the genome that could affect the accessibility of the chromosomal DNA to HR processes and thereby the frequency of HR.",

Previous studies have shown that dGAP induces genetic mutations in bacterial and mammalian cells. One potential source of these mutations is the error-prone bypass of dGAP lesions catalyzed by the low-fidelity Y-family DNA polymerases. To provide a comparative analysis of the mutagenic potential of the translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) of dGAP, we employed short oligonucleotide sequencing assays (SOSAs) with the model Y-family DNA polymerase from Sulfolobus solfataricus, DNA Polymerase IV (Dpo4), and the human Y-family DNA polymerases eta (hPol\u03b7), kappa (hPol\u03ba), and iota (hPol\u03b9). Relative to undamaged DNA, all four enzymes generated far more mutations (base deletions, insertions, and substitutions) with a DNA template containing a site-specifically placed dGAP. Opposite dGAP and at an immediate downstream template position, the most frequent mutations made by the three human enzymes were base deletions and the most frequent base substitutions were dAs for all enzymes. Based on the SOSA data, Dpo4 was the least error-prone Y-family DNA polymerase among the four enzymes during the TLS of dGAP. Among the three human Y-family enzymes, hPol\u03ba made the fewest mutations at all template positions except opposite the lesion site. hPol\u03ba was significantly less error-prone than hPol\u03b9 and hPol\u03b7 during the extension of dGAP bypass products. Interestingly, the most frequent mutations created by hPol\u03b9 at all template positions were base deletions. Although hRev1, the fourth human Y-family enzyme, could not extend dGAP bypass products in our standing start assays, it preferentially incorporated dCTP opposite the bulky lesion. Collectively, these mutagenic profiles suggest that hPolk and hRev1 are the most suitable human Y-family DNA polymerases to perform TLS of dGAP in humans.",

The biological functions of Pol2p, the catalytic subunit of Pol \u025b, are subject of active investigation, while the role of the other three, noncatalytic subunits, is not well defined. We showed previously that mutations in Dpb2p, a noncatalytic but essential subunit of Pol \u025b HE, influence the fidelity of DNA replication in yeast cells. The strength of the mutator phenotype due to the different dpb2 alleles was inversely proportional to the strength of protein\u2013protein interactions between Pol2p and the mutated forms of Dpb2p. To understand better the mechanisms of the contribution of Dpb2p to the controlling of the level of spontaneous mutagenesis we undertook here a further genetic analysis of the mutator phenotype observed in dpb2 mutants. We demonstrate that the presence of mutated forms of Dpb2p in the cell not only influences the intrinsic fidelity of Pol \u025b but also facilitates more frequent participation of error-prone DNA polymerase zeta (Pol \u03b6) in DNA replication. The obtained results suggest that the structural integrity of Pol \u025b HE is a crucial contributor to accurate chromosomal DNA replication and, when compromised, favors participation of error prone DNA Pol \u03b6 in this process.",

Data are scarce, however, on the combined effect of radiation with other environmental carcinogens and the underlying mechanisms involved. We studied the mode and mechanism of the carcinogenic effect of radiation in combination with N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) using doses approximately equal to the corresponding thresholds. B6C3F1 mice exposed to fractionated X-irradiation (Kaplan's method) followed by ENU developed T-cell lymphomas in a dose-dependent manner. Radiation doses above an apparent threshold acted synergistically with ENU to promote lymphoma development, whereas radiation doses below that threshold antagonized lymphoma development. Ikaros, which regulates the commitment and differentiation of lymphoid lineage cells, is a critical tumor suppressor gene frequently altered in both human and mouse lymphomas and shows distinct mutation spectra between X-ray- and ENU-induced lymphomas. In the synergistically induced lymphomas, we observed a low frequency of LOH and an inordinate increase of Ikaros base substitutions characteristic of ENU-indcued point mutations, G:C to A:T at non-CpG, A:T to G:C, G:C to T:A and A:T to T:A. This suggests that radiation doses above an apparent threshold activate the ENU mutagenic pathway. This is the first report on the carcinogenic mechanism elicited by combined exposure to carcinogens below and above threshold doses based on the mutation spectrum of the causative gene. These findings constitute a basis for assessing human cancer risk following exposure to multiple carcinogens.",

Therefore, it is important to determine the correlation of biological effects with the Bragg curve energy distribution of heavy ions.In this study, a continuous biological tissue equivalent was constructed using a layered cylinder of Arabidopsis seeds, which was irradiated with carbon ions of 87.5\u00a0MeV/nucleon. The position of energy loss peak in the seed pool was determined with CR-39 track detectors. The mutagenic effect in vivo along the path of carbon ions was investigated with the seeds in each layer as an assay unit, which corresponded to a given position in physical Bragg curve. Homologous recombination frequency (HRF), expression level of AtRAD54 gene, germination rate of seeds, and survival rate of young seedlings were used as checking endpoints, respectively. Our results showed that Arabidopsis S0 and S1 plants exhibited significant increases in HRF compared to their controls, and the expression level of AtRAD54 gene in S0 plants was significantly up-regulated. The depth-biological effect curves for HRF and the expression of AtRAD54 gene were not consistent with the physical Bragg curve. Differently, the depth-biological effect curves for the developmental endpoints matched generally with the physical Bragg curve. The results suggested a different response pattern of various types of biological events to heavy ion irradiation. It is also interesting that except for HRF in S0 plants, the depth-biological effect curves for each biological endpoint were similar for 5\u00a0Gy and 30\u00a0Gy of carbon irradiation.",

The effect of alcohol consumption on the levels and persistence of N2-ethylidene-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (N2-ethylidene-dG) formed by acetaldehyde, the oxidative metabolite of ethanol, in human leukocyte DNA was investigated. DNA was isolated from venous blood samples obtained from 30 male non-smoking individuals before consumption of alcohol (0\u00a0h) and subsequently at 3\u20135\u00a0h following the consumption of 150\u00a0mL of vodka (containing 42% pure ethanol).

The levels of N2-ethyl-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (N2-ethyl-dG) in the DNA were determined following reduction of N2-ethylidene-dG with sodium cyanoborohydride using a liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry selected reaction monitoring method. A slight time-dependent trend showing an increase and decrease in the levels of N2-ethyl-dG was observed following consumption of alcohol compared to time 0\u00a0h, however, the differences were not statistically significant.

Blocking of transcriptional elongation is the best studied of these mechanisms. Transcription recovery after damage therefore has often been used as a surrogate marker of DNA repair in cells. However, it has become evident that relationships between DNA damage, repair, and transcription are more complex due to various indirect effects of DNA damage on gene transcription. These include inhibition of transcription by DNA repair intermediates as well as regulation of transcription and of the epigenetic status of the genes by DNA repair-related mechanisms. In addition, since transcription is emerging as an important endogenous source of DNA damage in cells, we briefly summarise recent advances in understanding the nature of co-transcriptionally induced DNA damage and the DNA repair pathways involved.",

To protect their genomes against the harmful effect of these environmental insults, organisms have evolved highly diverse and efficient repair mechanisms. Defective DNA repair processes can lead to various kinds of chromosomal and developmental abnormalities. RecQ helicases are a family of evolutionarily conserved, DNA unwinding proteins which are actively engaged in various DNA metabolic processes, telomere maintenance and genome stability. Bacteria and lower eukaryotes, like yeast, have only one RecQ homolog, whereas higher eukaryotes including humans possess multiple RecQ helicases. These multiple RecQ helicases have redundant and/or non-redundant functions depending on the types of DNA damage and DNA repair pathways. Humans have five different RecQ helicases and defects in three of them cause autosomal recessive diseases leading to various kinds of cancer predisposition and/or aging phenotypes. Emerging evidence also suggests that the RecQ helicases have important roles in telomere maintenance. This review mainly focuses on recent knowledge about the roles of RecQ helicases in DNA double strand break repair and telomere maintenance which are important in preserving genome integrity.",

     "abstract": "DNA repair activity is of interest as a potential biomarker of individual susceptibility to genotoxic agents. In view of the current trend for exploitation of large cohorts in molecular epidemiology projects, there is a pressing need for the development of phenotypic DNA repair assays that are high-throughput, very sensitive, inexpensive and reliable.Towards this goal we have developed and validated two phenotypic assays for the measurement of two DNA repair enzymes in cell extracts: (1) O6-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT), which repairs the O6-alkylguanine-type of adducts induced in DNA by alkylating genotoxins; and (2) apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE 1), which participates in base excision repair (BER) by causing a rate-limiting DNA strand cleavage 5\u2032 to the abasic sites.The MGMT assay makes use of the fact that: (a) the enzyme works by irreversibly transferring the alkyl group from the O6 position of guanine to a cystein residue in its active site and thereby becomes inactivated and (b) that the free base O6-benzylguanine (BG) is a very good substrate for MGMT. In the new assay, cell extracts are incubated with BG tagged with biotin and the resulting MGMT-BG-biotin complex is immobilized on anti-MGMT-coated microtiter plates, followed by quantitation using streptavidin-conjugated alkaline phosphatase and a chemiluminescence-producing substrate.A one-step/one-tube phenotypic assay for APE1 activity has been developed based on the use of a fluorescent molecular beacon (partially self-complementary oligonucleotide with a hairpin-loop structure carrying a fluorophore and a quencher at each end). It also contains a single tetrahydrofuran residue (THF) which is recognized and cleaved by APE1, and the subsequently formed single-stranded oligomer becomes a fluorescence signal emitter. Both assays are highly sensitive, require very small amounts of protein extracts, are relatively inexpensive and can be easily automated. They have been extensively validated and are being used in the context of large-scale molecular epidemiology studies.",

     "abstract": "The base excision repair (BER) pathway corrects many different DNA base lesions and is important for genomic stability. The mechanism of BER cannot easily be investigated in intact cells and therefore in vitro methods that reflect the in vivo processes are in high demand. Reconstitution of BER using purified proteins essentially mirror properties of the proteins used, and does not necessarily reflect the mechanism as it occurs in the cell. Nuclear extracts from cultured cells have the capacity to carry out complete BER and can give important information on the mechanism. Furthermore, candidate proteins in extracts can be inhibited or depleted in a controlled way, making defined extracts an important source for mechanistic studies. The major drawback is that there is no standardized method of preparing nuclear extract for BER studies, and it does not appear to be a topic given much attention. Here we have examined BER activity of nuclear cell extracts from HeLa cells, using as substrate a circular DNA molecule with either uracil or an AP-site in a defined position. We show that BER activity of nuclear extracts from the same batch of cells varies inversely with the volume of nuclear extraction buffer relative to nuclei volume, in spite of identical protein concentrations in the BER assay mixture. Surprisingly, the uracil\u2013DNA glycosylase activity (mainly UNG2), but not amount of UNG2, also correlated negatively with the volume of extraction buffer. These studies demonstrate that the method for preparation of nuclear extract is an important factor to consider for in vitro BER analysis and conditions used in comparative studies must be carefully worked out.",

     "abstract": "It has long been known that the level of radiosensitivity between individuals covers a considerable range. This range is reflected in analysis of patient cell lines with some cell lines showing significantly reduced sensitivity to in vitro radiation exposure. Our increased exposure to radiation from diagnostic medical procedures and other life style changes has raised concerns that there may be individuals who are at an elevated risk from the harmful impact of acute or chronic low dose radiation exposure. Additionally, a subset of patients show an enhanced normal tissue response following radiotherapy, which can cause significant discomfort and, at the extreme, be life threatening. It has long been realised that the ability to identify sensitive individuals and to understand the mechanistic basis underlying the range of sensitivity within the population is important. A reduced ability to efficiently repair DNA double strand breaks (DSB) and/or activate the DSB damage response underlies some, although not necessarily all, of this sensitivity. In this article, we consider the utility of the recently developed \u03b3H2AX foci analysis to provide insight into radiation sensitivity within the population. We consider the nature of sensitivity including the impact of radiation on cell survival, tissue responses and carcinogenesis and the range of responses within the population. We overview the current utility of the \u03b3H2AX assay for assessing the efficacy of the DNA damage response to low and high dose radiation and its potential future exploitation.",

However, current existing assays aimed at measuring DNA repair address only a specific repair step dedicated to the correction of a specific DNA lesion type. Consequently they provide no information regarding the repair pathways that handle other types of lesions. In addition to aging, consequences of photo-exposure on these repair processes remain elusive. In this study we evaluated the consequence of aging and of chronic and/or acute photo-exposure on DNA repair in human skin fibroblasts using a multiplexed approach, which provided detailed information on several repair pathways at the same time. The resulting data were analyzed with adapted statistics/bioinformatics tools. We showed that, irrespective of the repair pathway considered, excision/synthesis was less efficient in non-exposed cells from elderly compared to cells from young adults and that photo-exposure disrupted this very clear pattern. Moreover, it was evidenced that chronic sun-exposure induced changes in DNA repair properties. Finally, the identification of a specific signature at the level of the NER pathway in cells repeatedly exposed to sun revealed a cumulative effect of UVB exposure and chronic sun irradiation. The uses of bioinformatics tools in this study was essential to fully take advantage of the large sum of data obtained with our multiplexed DNA repair assay and unravel the effects of environmental exposure on DNA repair pathways.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p53, often called the guardian of the genome, is involved in important cellular processes, such as cell cycle control, apoptosis and DNA repair. With respect to BER, p53 might physically interact with and affect the transcription of different BER proteins such as hOGG1, APE1 or Pol\u03b2. In studies in HCT116 p53\u2212/\u2212 cells previously published, activity and mRNA expression of hOGG1 were found to be significantly decreased, while down-regulation of APE1 mRNA and protein levels in response to genotoxic stress were only described in HCT116 p53+/+ cells, but not in the isogenic p53 knockout cell line. The predominantly indirect genotoxic carcinogen cadmium inhibits the BER pathway and potentially interferes with zinc binding proteins such as p53. Therefore, this study was accomplished to investigate whether p53 is involved in the cadmium-induced inhibition of BER activity. To address this issue we applied a non-radioactive cleavage test system based on a Cy5-labeled oligonucleotide. We present evidence that p53 is not essential for hOGG1 and APE1 gene expression as well as OGG and APE activity in unstressed HCT116 cells; however, it plays an important role in the cellular response to cadmium treatment. Here, a direct involvement of p53 was only observed with respect to APE1 gene expression contributing to an altered APE activity, while OGG activity was presumably affected indirectly due to a stronger accumulation of cadmium in HCT116 p53+/+ cells. In summary, p53 indeed affects the BER pathway directly and indirectly in response to cadmium treatment.",

At least three of them, N-dimethylnitrosamine, N\u2032-nitrosonornicotine and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone, attack DNA at the O6-position of guanine. The resulting O6-alkylguanine adducts are repaired by the suicide enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), which is known to protect against the mutagenic, genotoxic and carcinogenic effects of monofunctional alkylating agents. While in rat liver MGMT was shown to be subject to regulation by genotoxic stress leading to adaptive changes in its activity, in humans evidence of adaptive modulation of MGMT levels is still lacking. Several polymorphisms are known, which are suspected to impact on the risk of developing cancer. In this review we focus on three questions: (a) Has tobacco consumption by smoking or chewing an impact on MGMT expression and MGMT promoter methylation in normal and tumor tissue? (b) Is there an association between MGMT polymorphisms and cancer risk and is this risk related to smoking? (c) Does MGMT protect against tobacco-associated cancer? There are several lines of evidence for an increase of MGMT activity in the normal tissue of smokers compared to non-smokers. Furthermore, in tumors developed in smokers a tendency towards an increase of MGMT expression was found. The data points to the possibility that agents in tobacco smoke are able to trigger upregulation of MGMT in normal and tumor tissue. For MGMT promoter methylation data is conflicting. There is some evidence for an association between MGMT polymorphisms and smoking-induced cancer risk. The key question whether or not MGMT protects against tobacco smoke-induced cancer is difficult to answer since prospective studies on smokers versus non-smokers are lacking and appropriate animal studies with MGMT transgenic mice exposed to the complex mixture of tobacco smoke have not been performed, which indicates the need for further explorations.",

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is characterized by the influx of neutrophils and is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species that can damage DNA. Oxidative DNA damage is generally thought to be involved in the increased risk of cancer in inflamed tissues. We previously demonstrated that activated neutrophil mediated oxidative stress results in a reduction in nucleotide excision repair (NER) capacity, which could further enhance mutagenesis. Inflammation and oxidative stress are critical factors in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that is linked with enhanced liver cancer risk. In this report, we therefore evaluated the role of neutrophils and the associated oxidative stress in damage recognition and DNA repair in steatotic livers of 35 severely obese subjects with either nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (n\u00a0=\u00a017) or steatosis alone (n\u00a0=\u00a018). The neutrophilic influx in liver was assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) staining and the amount of oxidative DNA damage by measuring M1dG adducts. No differences in M1dG adduct levels were observed between patients with or without NASH and also not between individuals with high or low MPO immunoreactivity. However, we found that high expression of MPO in the liver, irrespective of disease status, reduced the damage recognition capacity as determined by staining for histone 2AX phosphorylation (\u03b3H2AX). This reduction in \u03b3H2AX formation in individuals with high MPO immunoreactivity was paralleled by a significant decrease in NER capacity as assessed by a functional repair assay, and was not related to cell proliferation. Thus, the observed reduction in NER capacity upon hepatic inflammation is associated with and may be a consequence of reduced damage recognition. These findings suggest a novel mechanism of liver cancer development in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.",

This is followed by mutations in RAS, TP53, and other genes. Progression of carcinogenic process in the colon is accompanied by augmentation of the oxidative stress, which manifests in the increased level of oxidatively damaged DNA both in the colon epithelium, and in blood leukocytes and urine, already at the earliest stages of disease development. Defence mechanisms are deregulated in CRC patients: (i) antioxidative vitamins level in blood plasma declines with the development of disease; (ii) mRNA level of base excision repair enzymes in blood leukocytes of CRC patients is significantly increased; however, excision rate is regulated separately, being increased for 8-oxoGua, while decreased for lipid peroxidation derived ethenoadducts, \u025bAde and \u025bCyt; (iii) excision rate of \u025bAde and \u025bCyt in colon tumors is significantly increased in comparison to asymptomatic colon margin, and ethenoadducts level is decreased.

In this limited study of four very small age-matched 24-individual groups of male and female whites and African-Americans aged 30\u201364 years, we found that females have higher single strand break (SSB) levels than males (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). There was a significant negative correlation between SSB-RC and SSB level (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041).

     "abstract": "DNA suffers from a wide range of damage, both from extracellular agents and via endogenous mechanisms. Damage of DNA can lead to cancer and other diseases. Therefore, it is plausible that sequence variants in DNA repair genes are involved in cancer development. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis, based on the \u201cVenice criteria\u201d, showed that out of 241 associations investigated, only three resulted to have a strong grade of cumulative evidence. These associations were: two SNPs rs1799793 and rs13181 in the ERCC2 gene and lung cancer (recessive model) and rs1805794 in the NBN gene and bladder cancer (dominant model). An update of this meta-analysis has been performed in the present paper, and we found partially inconsistent results. Inconsistencies in the literature are thus far not easy to explain. In addition, none of the cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAs) published so far showed highly statistically significant associations for any of the common DNA repair gene variants, in such a way as to place DNA repair genes among the top 10-20 hits identified in GWAs. Though this suggests that it is unlikely that DNA repair gene polymorphisms per se play a major role, a clarification of the discrepancies in the literature is needed. Also, gene/environment and gene/lifestyle interactions for the carcinogenic mechanisms involving DNA repair should be investigated more systematically and with less classification error. Finally, the combined effect of multiple SNPs in several genes in one or more relevant DNA repair pathways could have a greater impact on pathological phenotypes than SNPs in single genes, but this has been investigated only occasionally.",

     "abstract": "DNA repair plays a major role in maintaining genetic stability, and so measurement of individual DNA repair capacity should be a valued tool in molecular epidemiology studies. The comet assay (single cell gel electrophoresis), in different versions, is commonly used to measure the repair pathways represented by strand break rejoining, removal of 8-oxoguanine, and repair of bulky adducts or UV-induced damage. Repair enzyme activity generally does not reflect the level of gene expression; but there is evidence \u2013 albeit piecemeal \u2013 that it is affected by polymorphisms in repair genes. There are mixed reports concerning the regulation of repair by environmental factors; several nutritional supplementation trials with phytochemical-rich foods have demonstrated increases in base excision repair of oxidation damage, while others have shown no effect. Exposure to genotoxic agents has in general not been found to stimulate repair. Crucial questions concerning the factors regulating repair and the causes of individual variation are as yet unanswered.",

     "abstract": "Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are members of a multigene family of isoenzymes that are important in the control of oxidative stress and in phase II metabolism. Acting non-enzymically, GSTs can modulate signalling pathways of cell proliferation, cell differentiation and apoptosis. Using a molecular epidemiology approach, we have investigated a potential involvement of GSTs in DNA damage processing, specifically the modulation of DNA repair in a group of 388 healthy adult volunteers; 239 with at least 5 years of occupational exposure to asbestos, stone wool or glass fibre, and 149 reference subjects.We measured DNA damage in lymphocytes using the comet assay (alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis): strand breaks (SBs) and alkali-labile sites, oxidised pyrimidines with endonuclease III, and oxidised purines with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase. We also measured GST activity in erythrocytes, and the capacity for base excision repair (BER) in a lymphocyte extract. Polymorphisms in genes encoding three GST isoenzymes were determined, namely deletion of GSTM1 and GSTT1 and single nucleotide polymorphism Ile105Val in GSTP1.Consumption of vegetables and wine correlated negatively with DNA damage and modulated BER. GST activity correlated with oxidised bases and with BER capacity, and differed depending on polymorphisms in GSTP1, GSTT1 and GSTM1. A significantly lower BER rate was associated with the homozygous GSTT1 deletion in all asbestos site subjects and in the corresponding reference group. Multifactorial analysis revealed effects of sex and exposure in GSTP1 Ile/Val heterozygotes but not in Ile/Ile homozygotes. These variants affected also SBs levels, mainly by interactions of GSTP1 genotype with exposure, with sex, and with smoking habit; and by an interaction between sex and smoking. Our results show that GST polymorphisms and GST activity can apparently influence DNA stability and repair of oxidised bases, suggesting a potential new role for these proteins in DNA damage processing via DNA damage signalling.",

     "abstract": "The catechol-mediated DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II) ions involves oxidation of guanine to 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and DNA strand scission. It proceeds through the reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. The mutagenicity of 8-oxoG lesions is due to its miscoding propensity reflected in GC\u2192TA transversion taking place during the DNA repair process. To gain new insights into the nature of catechol-mediated DNA damage and its prevention, we have investigated the changes in DNA melting characteristics and 8-oxoG formation as the indicators of DNA damage in a model calf-thymus DNA system. A novel fluorescence method for DNA melting temperature determination, based on DAPI fluorescent-probe staining, has been proposed. The DNA melting-onset temperature has been found to be more sensitive to DNA damage than the standard melting temperature due to the increased width of the melting transition observed in oxidatively damaged DNA. We have found that the efficiency of Fenton cascade in generating DNA-damaging ROS is higher for catechol than for GSH, two strong antioxidants, mainly due to the much longer distance between ROS-generating radical group in GS to nucleobases than that of semiquinone radical group to nucleobases (2.1\u00a0nm vs. 0.27\u00a0nm), making the ROS transport from GSH an order of magnitude less likely to damage DNA because of short lifetime of HO radicals. The antioxidant and DNA-protecting behaviors of GSH have been elucidated. We have found that the redox potential of GSH/GSSG couple is lower than that of catechol/semiquinone couple. Hence, GSH keeps catechol in the reduced state, thereby shutting down the initial step of the catechol-mediated Fenton cascade. The catechol-induced DNA damage in the presence of Cu(II) ions has also been confirmed in studies of ON\u2013OFF hairpin-oligonucleotide beacons.",

     "abstract": "The human endonuclease V gene is located in chromosome 17q25.3 and encodes a 282 amino acid protein that shares about 30% sequence identity with bacterial endonuclease V. This study reports biochemical properties of human endonuclease V with respect to repair of deaminated base lesions. Using soluble proteins fused to thioredoxin at the N-terminus, we determined repair activities of human endonuclease V on deoxyinosine (I)-, deoxyxanthosine (X)-, deoxyoxanosine (O)- and deoxyuridine (U)-containing DNA. Human endonuclease V is most active with deoxyinosine-containing DNA but with minor activity on deoxyxanthosine-containing DNA. Endonuclease activities on deoxyuridine and deoxyoxanosine were not detected. The endonuclease activity on deoxyinosine-containing DNA follows the order of single-stranded I\u00a0>\u00a0G/I\u00a0>\u00a0T/I\u00a0>\u00a0A/I\u00a0>\u00a0C/I. The preference of the catalytic activity correlates with the binding affinity of these deoxyinosine-containing DNAs. Mg2+ and to a much less extent, Mn2+, Ni2+, Co2+ can support the endonuclease activity. Introduction of human endonuclease V into Escherichia coli cells deficient in nfi, mug and ung genes caused three-fold reduction in mutation frequency. This is the first report of deaminated base repair activity for human endonuclease V. The relationship between the endonuclease activity and deaminated deoxyadenosine (deoxyinosine) repair is discussed.",

However, in plants, no quantitative data are available on the molecular nature of the mutations induced with high-LET radiation above 101\u2013124\u00a0keV\u00a0\u03bcm\u22121. In this study, we irradiated dry seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana with Ar and C ions with an LET of 290\u00a0keV\u00a0\u03bcm\u22121. We analyzed the DNA alterations caused by the higher-LET radiation. Mutants were identified from the M2 pools. In total, 14 and 13 mutated genes, including bin2, egy1, gl1, gl2, hy1, hy3\u20135, ttg1, and var2, were identified in the plants derived from Ar- and C-ions irradiation, respectively. In the mutants from both irradiations, deletion was the most frequent type of mutation; 13 of the 14 mutated genes from the Ar ion-irradiated plants and 11 of the 13 mutated genes from the C ion-irradiated plants harbored deletions. Analysis of junction regions generated by the 2 types of irradiation suggested that alternative non-homologous end-joining was the predominant pathway of repair of break points. Among the deletions, the proportion of large deletions (>100\u00a0bp) was about 54% for Ar-ion irradiation and about 64% for C-ion irradiation. Both current results and previously reported data revealed that the proportions of the large deletions induced by 290-keV\u00a0\u03bcm\u22121 radiations were higher than those of the large deletions induced by lower-LET radiations (6% for 22.5\u201330.0\u00a0keV\u00a0\u03bcm\u22121 and 27% for 101\u2013124\u00a0keV\u00a0\u03bcm\u22121). Therefore, the 290\u00a0keV\u00a0\u03bcm\u22121 heavy-ion beams can effectively induce large deletions and will prove useful as novel mutagens for plant breeding and analysis of gene functions, particularly tandemly arrayed genes.",

     "abstract": "Calcineurin is a Ca2+-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase and the target of the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin and tacrolimus, which are used in transplant recipients to prevent rejection. Unfortunately, the therapeutic use of this drugs is complicated by a high incidence of skin malignancy, which has set off a number of studies into the role of calcineurin signaling in skin, particularly with respect to cell cycle control and DNA repair. Both UVA1 radiation and arsenic species are known to promote skin cancer development via production of reactive oxygen species. In light of the well-documented sensitivity of calcineurin to oxidative stress, we examined and compared the effects of UVA1 and arsenite on calcineurin signaling.In this paper, we show that physiologically relevant doses of UVA1 radiation and low micromolar concentrations of arsenite strongly inhibit calcineurin phosphatase activity in Jurkat and skin cells and decrease NFAT nuclear translocation in Jurkat cells. The effects on calcineurin signaling could be partly prevented by inhibition of NADPH oxidase in Jurkat cells or increased dismutation of superoxide in Jurkat and skin cells. In addition, both UVA1 and arsenite decreased NF-\u03baB activity, although at lower concentrations, arsenite enhanced NF-\u03baB activity. These data indicate that UVA1 and arsenite affect a signal transduction route of growingly acknowledged importance in skin and that calcineurin may serve as a potential link between ROS exposure and impaired tumor suppression.",

     "abstract": "The loss of the H2O2 scavenger protein encoded by Prdx1 in mice leads to an elevation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tumorigenesis of different tissues. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) mutations could initiate tumorigenesis through loss of tumor suppressor gene function in heterozygous somatic cells. A connection between the severity of ROS and the frequency of LOH mutations in vivo has not been established. Therefore, in this study, we characterized in vivo LOH in ear fibroblasts and splenic T cells of 3\u20134 month old Prdx1 deficient mice. We found that the loss of Prdx1 significantly elevates ROS amounts in T cells and fibroblasts. The basal amounts of ROS were higher in fibroblasts than in T cells, probably due to a less robust Prdx1 peroxidase activity in the former. Using Aprt as a LOH reporter, we observed an elevation in LOH mutation frequency in fibroblasts, but not in T cells, of Prdx1\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to Prdx1+/+ mice. The majority of the LOH mutations in both cell types were derived from mitotic recombination (MR) events. Interestingly, Mlh1, which is known to suppress MR between divergent sequences, was found to be significantly down-regulated in fibroblasts of Prdx1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Therefore, the combination of elevated ROS amounts and down-regulation of Mlh1 may have contributed to the elevation of MR in fibroblasts of Prdx1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We conclude that each tissue may have a distinct mechanism through which Prdx1 deficiency promotes tumorigenesis.",

     "abstract": "Inappropriate survival signaling after DNA damage may facilitate clonal expansion of genetically compromised cells, and it is known that protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors activate key survival pathways. In this study we employed the genotoxicant, hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)], which is a well-documented carcinogen of occupational and environmental concern. Cr(VI) induces a complex array of DNA damage, including DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). We recently reported that PTP inhibition bypassed cell cycle arrest and abrogated Cr(VI)-induced clonogenic lethality. Notably, PTP inhibition resulted in an increase in forward mutations at the HPRT locus, supporting the hypothesis that PTP inhibition in the presence of DNA damage may lead to genomic instability (GIN), via cell cycle checkpoint bypass. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of PTP inhibition on DNA DSB formation and chromosomal integrity after Cr(VI) exposure. Diploid human lung fibroblasts were treated with Cr(VI) in the presence or absence of the PTP inhibitor, sodium orthovanadate, for up to 24\u00a0h, and cells were analyzed for DNA DSBs and chromosomal damage. Cr(VI) treatment induced a rapid increase in DNA DSBs, and a significant increase in total chromosomal damage (chromatid breaks and gaps) after 24\u00a0h. In sharp contrast, PTP inhibition abrogated both DNA DSBs and chromosomal damage after Cr(VI) treatment. In summary, PTP inhibition in the face of Cr(VI) genotoxic stress decreases chromosomal instability (CIN) but increases mutagenesis, which we postulate to be a result of error-prone DNA repair.",

Using single-molecule PCR, the frequency of mutation at the mouse expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) locus Ms6-hm was established in sperm samples of treated males, as well as in sperm and brain of their first-generation offspring. ESTR mutation frequency in the germline of males sacrificed immediately after treatment or sampled 6 and 10 weeks after the end of dietary restriction did not significantly differ from that in age-matched control groups. The frequency of ESTR mutation in DNA samples extracted from sperm and brain of the first-generation offspring of treated mice was also similar to that in controls.

Cytogenetic analysis revealed a higher frequency of aberrations at 18\u00a0h and 10 days after treatment in BLM-exposed cultures vs. untreated cultures, although the yield of BLM-induced aberrations 10 days after treatment decreased about 25% compared with the one at 18\u00a0h after treatment. Moreover, the level of telomerase activity in BLM-treated cells compared with that of untreated control cells was significantly higher at 10 days after treatment, but did not differ at 18\u00a0h after treatment. These data indicate that in terms of unstable aberrations, the in vitro clastogenic effect of BLM on ADIPO-P2 cells persists for at least 10 days after exposure. In addition, our data demonstrate, for the first time, that BLM-induced telomere instability in mammalian cells (cytogenetically detectable as incomplete chromosome elements and telomere FISH signal loss and duplication) persists for several generations after exposure. Moreover, the appearance of telomere fusions in BLM-exposed cells 10 days after treatment suggests that this compound can induce delayed telomere instability. The increase in telomerase activity in BLM-exposed cells 10 days after treatment is accompanied by the presence of aberrations directly related to telomere dysfunction. This fact suggests that telomerase is not directly involved in BLM-induced telomere instability.",

While it has been documented that berberine induces G1 arrest by activating the p53-p21 cascade, it remains unclear what mechanism underlies the berberine-induced G2/M arrest, which is p53-independent. In this study, we tested the anti-proliferative effect of berberine on murine prostate cancer cell line RM-1 and characterized the underlying mechanisms. Berberine dose-dependently induced DNA double-strand breaks and apoptosis. At low concentrations, berberine was observed to induce G1 arrest, concomitant with the activation of p53-p21 cascade. Upon exposure to berberine at a higher concentration (50\u00a0\u03bcM) for 24\u00a0h, cells exhibited G2/M arrest. Pharmacological inhibition of ATM by KU55933, or Chk1 by UCN-01, could efficiently abrogate the G2/M arrest in berberine-treated cells. Downregulation of Chk1 by RNA interference also abolished the G2/M arrest caused by berberine, confirming the role of Chk1 in the pathway leading to G2/M arrest. Abrogation of G2/M arrest by ATM inhibition forced more cells to undergo apoptosis in response to berberine treatment. Chk1 inhibition by UCN-01, on the other hand, rendered cells more sensitive to berberine only when p53 was inhibited. Our results suggest that combined administration of berberine and caffeine, or other ATM inhibitor, may accelerate the killing of cancer cells.",

However, after adjustment for multiple comparisons we observed the following significant interactions for colon cancer: NOS2A and lutein, EPX and aspirin/NSAID use, and NOS2A (4 SNPs) and cigarette smoking. For rectal cancer we observed the following interactions after adjustment for multiple comparisons: HIF1A and vitamin E, NOS2A (3SNPs) with calcium; MPO with lutein; HIF1A with lycopene; NOS2A with selenium; EPX and NOS2A with aspirin/NSAID use; HIF1A, MPO, and NOS2A (3 SNPs) with cigarette smoking.

While the dynamics of SDF is a species-specific characteristic, in the case of humans, there is still significant variation within patients. To evaluate the suitability of the dynamic SDF assay to assess the adverse effects of agents that cause genetic damage, fresh semen samples from different donors were exposed in vitro to (1) increasing acute doses of ionizing radiation, (2) elevated temperature (41\u00a0\u00b0C and 45\u00a0\u00b0C), (3) acidic pH (pH 4) and (4) the nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Sperm DNA fragmentation was analyzed after an incubation period of chronic (24\u00a0h), or acute (1\u00a0h) exposure to each treatment followed by incubation at 37\u00a0\u00b0C over a period of 24\u00a0h. SDF was assessed using the sperm chromatin dispersion (SCD) test. Dynamic SDF for each treatment was analyzed using Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves. All agents, except for ionizing radiation, accelerated SDF kinetics following chronic exposure over a 24\u00a0h period. Transient exposure to NO and heat but not acidic pH increased the basal (T0) level of SDF. Despite the removal of the three toxicants, the remaining sperm following acute exposure showed a decrease in their expected DNA longevity. It is concluded that the assessment of sperm DNA fragmentation dynamics is an effective methodological approach for revealing latent damage associated with toxicants that is not initially expressed following a single initial observation of SDF.",

Mutation levels in fetuses were elevated at 9.5\u00a0dpc (days post coitum) when compared to wild-type mice, and the level of mutations continued to increase until the fetuses reached the newborn stage. The mutation levels in 4 different tissues of newborns showed similar magnitudes to those in the whole body. The levels remained similar after birth until 6 months of age. The molecular nature of the mutations examined in 12.5\u00a0dpc fetuses of Msh2+/+ and Msh2\u2212/\u2212 revealed unique spectra which reflect errors produced during the DNA replication process, and those corrected by a mismatch repair system. Most base substitutions and simple deletions were reduced by the presence of the Msh2 gene, whereas G:C to A:T changes at CpG sequences were not affected, suggesting that the latter change was not influenced by mismatch repair. On the other hand, analysis of developmental indices revealed that there was very little effect, including the presence of malformations, resulting from Msh2-deficiencies. These results indicate that elevated mutation levels have little effect on the development of the fetus, even if a mutator phenotype appears at the organogenesis stage.",

KDML 105) seeds showed 25.7% and 21.5% height reductions and one spindly rice mutant (TKOS4) showed 21.4% increase in comparison with that of the KDML 105 control. A cDNA-RAPD analysis identified differential gene expression in internode tissues of the rice mutants. Two genes identified from the cDNA-RAPD were OsSPY and 14-3-3, possibly associated with stem height variations of the semidwarf and spindly mutants, respectively. The OsSPY gene encoded the SPY protein which is considered to be a negative regulator of gibberellin (GA). On the other hand, the 14-3-3 encoded a signaling protein which can bind and prevent the RSG (repression of shoot growth) protein function as a transcriptional repressor of the kaurene oxidase (KO) gene in the GA biosynthetic pathway. Expression analysis of OsSPY, 14-3-3, RSG, KO, and SLR1 was confirmed in rice internode tissues during the reproductive stage of the plants by semi-quantitative RT-PCR technique. The expression analysis showed a clear increase of the levels of OsSPY transcripts in PKOS1 and HyKOS1 tissue samples compared to that of the KDML 105 and TKOS4 samples at the age of 50\u201360 days which were at the ages of internode elongation. The 14-3-3 expression had the highest increase in the TKOS4 samples compared to those in KDML 105, PKOS1 and HyKOS1 samples. The expression analysis of RSG and KO showed an increase in TKOS4 samples compared to that of the KDML 105 and that of the two semidwarf mutants.

MtDNA deletion mutations were found in both freshly isolated and cultured cells from 12-week-old mice. While there was no significant difference in the number of single cell colonies with mtDNA deletion mutations from any of the groups mentioned above, the abundance of mtDNA deletion mutations was significantly higher in the cultured cells, as determined by quantitative PCR. Within a single clonal cell population, the detectable mtDNA deletion mutations were the same in all cells and unique when compared to deletions of other colonies. We also found that cells harboring high levels of mtDNA deletion mutations (i.e. where deleted mtDNA comprised more than 60% of total mtDNA) had slower proliferation rates and decreased differentiation capacities.

The MECP2 gene has some unique characteristics: (1) it is mainly affected by de novo mutations, due to recurrent independent mutational events in a defined \u201chot spot\u201d regions or positions; (2) complex mutational events along a single allele are frequently found in this gene; (3) most mutations arise on paternal X chromosome. The recurrent point mutations involve mainly CpG dinucleotides, where C>T transitions are explained by methylation-mediated deamination. The complex mutational events might be explained by the genomic architecture of the region involving the MECP2 gene. The finding that most spontaneous mutations arise on paternal X-chromosome supports the higher contribution of replication-mediated mechanism of mutagenesis. We present 9 types of mutations in the MECP2 gene, detected in a group of 22 Bulgarian and 6 Romanian classical RTT patients. Thirteen patients were clarified on molecular level (46.4%). The point mutations in our sample account for 61.5%. One intraexonic deletion was detected in the present study (7.7%). One novel insertion c.321_322insGAAG, p.(Lys107_Leu108insGluAlafs2*) was found (7.7%). Large deletions and complex mutations account for 23%. A novel complex mutational event c.[584_624del41insTT; 638delTinsCA] was detected in a Romanian patient. We discuss different types of the MECP2 mutations detected in our sample in the light of the possible mechanisms of mutagenesis. Complex gene rearrangements involving a combination of deletions and insertions have always been most difficult to detect, to specify precisely and hence to explain in terms of their underlying mutational mechanisms.",

Whereas the latter group are almost invariably reported to protect against DNA damage, whether endogenous or induced by exogenous agents, the provitamin A carotenoids show a more varied spectrum of effects, sometimes protecting and sometimes enhancing DNA damage.

In various models, niacin deficiency has been found to cause impaired cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, delayed DNA excision repair, accumulation of single and double strand breaks, chromosomal breakage, telomere erosion and cancer development. Rat models suggest that most aspects of genomic instability are minimized by the recommended levels of niacin found in AIN-93 formulations; however, some beneficial responses do occur in the range from adequate up to pharmacological niacin intakes. Mouse models show a wide range of protection against UV-induced skin cancer well into pharmacological levels of niacin intake. It is currently a challenge to compare animal and human data to estimate the role of niacin status in the risk of genomic instability in human populations. It seems fairly certain that some portion of even affluent populations will benefit from niacin supplementation, and some subpopulations are likely well below an optimal intake of this vitamin.

     "abstract": "Folate plays a critical role in the prevention of uracil incorporation into DNA and hypomethylation of DNA. This activity is compromised when vitamin B12 concentration is low because methionine synthase activity is reduced, lowering the concentration of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) which in turn may diminish DNA methylation and cause folate to become unavailable for the conversion of dUMP to dTMP. The most plausible explanation for the chromosome-breaking effect of low folate is excessive uracil misincorporation into DNA, a mutagenic lesion that leads to strand breaks in DNA during repair. Both in vitro and in vivo studies with human cells clearly show that folate deficiency causes expression of chromosomal fragile sites, chromosome breaks, excessive uracil in DNA, micronucleus formation, DNA hypomethylation and mitochondrial DNA deletions. In vivo studies show that folate and/or vitamin B12 deficiency and elevated plasma homocysteine (a metabolic indicator of folate deficiency) are significantly correlated with increased micronucleus formation and reduced telomere length respectively. In vitro experiments indicate that genomic instability in human cells is minimised when folic acid concentration in culture medium is greater than 100\u00a0nmol/L. Intervention studies in humans show (a) that DNA hypomethylation, chromosome breaks, uracil incorporation and micronucleus formation are minimised when red cell folate concentration is greater than 700\u00a0nmol/L and (b) micronucleus formation is minimised when plasma concentration of vitamin B12 is greater than 300\u00a0pmol/L and plasma homocysteine is less than 7.5\u00a0\u03bcmol/L. These concentrations are achievable at intake levels at or above current recommended dietary intakes of folate (i.e. >400\u00a0\u03bcg/day) and vitamin B12 (i.e. >2\u00a0\u03bcg/day) depending on an individual's capacity to absorb and metabolise these vitamins which may vary due to genetic and epigenetic differences.",

     "abstract": "Dietary choline is an important modulator of gene expression (via epigenetic marks) and of DNA integrity. Choline was discovered to be an essential nutrient for some humans approximately one decade ago. This requirement is diminished in young women because estrogen drives endogenous synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, from which choline can be derived. Almost half of women have a single nucleotide polymorphism that abrogates estrogen-induction of endogenous synthesis, and these women require dietary choline just as do men. In the US, dietary intake of choline is marginal. Choline deficiency in people is associated with liver and muscle dysfunction and damage, with apoptosis, and with increased DNA strand breaks. Several mechanisms explain these modifications to DNA. Choline deficiency increases leakage of reactive oxygen species from mitochondria consequent to altered mitochondrial membrane composition and enhanced fatty acid oxidation. Choline deficiency impairs folate metabolism, resulting in decreased thymidylate synthesis and increased uracil misincorporation into DNA, with strand breaks resulting during error-prone repair attempts. Choline deficiency alters DNA methylation, which alters gene expression for critical genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, resulting in increased mutation rates. Any dietary deficiency which increases mutation rates should be associated with increased risk of cancers, and this is the case for choline deficiency. In rodent models, diets low in choline and methyl-groups result in spontaneous hepatocarcinomas. In human epidemiological studies, there are interesting data that suggest that this also may be the case for humans, especially those with SNPs that increase the dietary requirement for choline.",

The protective effect of vitamin C was observed at plasma levels\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0\u03bcmol/l. Vitamin C supplementation decreased the frequency of chromosomal aberrations in groups with insufficient dietary intake who were occupationally exposed to mutagens, and also decreased the sensitivity to mutagens as assessed using the bleomycin assay. High vitamin C levels in plasma decreased the frequency of genomic translocations in groups exposed to ionizing radiation or c-PAHs in polluted air. The frequency of micronuclei was decreased by vitamin C supplementation in smokers challenged with \u03b3-irradiation, and higher vitamin C levels in plasma counteracted the damage induced by air pollution. The prevalence of DNA adducts inversely correlated with vitamin C levels in groups environmentally exposed to high concentrations of c-PAHs. Increased vitamin C levels decreased DNA strand breakage induced by air pollution. Oxidative damage (8-oxodG levels) was decreased by vitamin C supplementation in groups with plasma levels\u00a0>\u00a050\u00a0\u03bcmol/l exposed to PM2.5 and c-PAHs.

     "abstract": "Vitamin D is a secosteroid best known for its role in maintaining bone and muscle health. Adequate levels of vitamin D may also be beneficial in maintaining DNA integrity. This role of vitamin D can be divided into a primary function that prevents damage from DNA and a secondary function that regulates the growth rate of cells. The potential for vitamin D to reduce oxidative damage to DNA in a human has been suggested by clinical trial where vitamin D supplementation reduced 8-hydroxy-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine, a marker of oxidative damage, in colorectal epithelial crypt cells. Studies in animal models and in different cell types have also shown marked reduction in oxidative stress damage and chromosomal aberrations, prevention of telomere shortening and inhibition of telomerase activity following treatment with vitamin D. The secondary function of vitamin D in preventing DNA damage includes regulation of the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase activity in the DNA damage response pathway involved in the detection of DNA lesions. It is also able to regulate the cell cycle to prevent the propagation of damaged DNA, and to regulate apoptosis to promote cell death. Vitamin D may contribute to prevention of human colorectal cancer, though there is little evidence to suggest that prevention of DNA damage mediates this effect, if real.

Biotinylation of both carboxylases and histones is catalyzed by holocarboxylase synthetase. Human biotin requirements are unknown. Recommendations for adequate intake of biotin are based on the typical intake of biotin in an apparently healthy population, which is only a crude estimate of the true intake due to analytical problems. Importantly, intake recommendations do not take into account possible effects of biotin deficiency on impairing genome stability. Recent studies suggest that biotin deficiency causes de-repression of long terminal repeats, thereby causing genome instability. While it was originally proposed that these effects are caused by loss of biotinylated histones, more recent evidence suggests a more immediate role of holocarboxylase synthetase in forming multiprotein complexes in chromatin that are important for gene repression. Holocarboxylase synthetase appears to interact physically with the methyl-CpG-binding domain protein 2 and, perhaps, histone methyl transferases, thereby creating epigenetic synergies between biotinylation and methylation events.

The reduced form of CoQ10 (ubiquinol, Q10H2) is an effective antioxidant in biological membranes. During the last years, particular interest has been grown on molecular effects of CoQ10 supplementation on mechanisms related to DNA damage prevention. This review describes recent advances in our understanding about the impact of CoQ10 on genomic stability in cells, animals and humans. With regard to several in vitro and in vivo studies, CoQ10 provides protective effects on several markers of oxidative DNA damage and genomic stability. In comparison to the number of studies reporting preventive effects of CoQ10 on oxidative stress biomarkers, CoQ10 intervention studies in humans with a direct focus on markers of DNA damage are limited. Thus, more well-designed studies in healthy and disease populations with long-term follow up results are needed to substantiate the reported beneficial effects of CoQ10 on prevention of DNA damage.",

     "abstract": "Cadmium is an ubiquitous environmental contaminant that represents hazard to humans and wildlife. It is found in the air, soil and water and, due to its extremely long half-life, accumulates in plants and animals. The main source of cadmium exposure for non-smoking human population is food. Cadmium is primarily toxic to the kidney, but has been also classified as carcinogenic to humans by several regulatory agencies. Current evidence suggests that exposure to cadmium induces genomic instability through complex and multifactorial mechanisms. Cadmium dose not induce direct DNA damage, however it induces increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, which in turn induce DNA damage and can also interfere with cell signalling. More important seems to be cadmium interaction with DNA repair mechanisms, cell cycle checkpoints and apoptosis as well as with epigenetic mechanisms of gene expression control. Cadmium mediated inhibition of DNA repair mechanisms and apoptosis leads to accumulation of cells with unrepaired DNA damage, which in turn increases the mutation rate and thus genomic instability. This increases the probability of developing not only cancer but also other diseases associated with genomic instability. In the in vitro experiments cadmium induced effects leading to genomic instability have been observed at low concentrations that were comparable to those observed in target organs and tissues of humans that were non-occupationally exposed to cadmium. Therefore, further studies aiming to clarify the relevance of these observations for human health risks due to cadmium exposure are needed.",

That this can occur in vitro with isolated DNA or chromatin, or by exposure of cultured mammalian cells to copper complexed with various agents, has been well demonstrated. Whether that is likely to occur in vivo is not as clear. This review addresses the question of whether and how copper ions or complexes \u2013 in forms that could be present in vivo, damage DNA and chromosome structure and/or promote epigenetic changes that can lead to pathology and diseases, including cancer and neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body dementias, and spongiform encephalopathies. This question is considered in light of our knowledge that copper-dependent enzymes are important contributors to antioxidant defense, and that the mammalian organism has robust mechanisms for maintaining constant levels of copper not only in body fluids but in its major organs. Overall, and except in unusual genetic states that lead to copper overload in specific cells (particularly those in liver), it appears that excessive intake of copper is not a significant factor in the development of disease states.",

     "abstract": "Iron is an essential micronutrient which is required in a relatively narrow range for maintaining metabolic homeostasis and genome stability. Iron participates in oxygen transport and mitochondrial respiration as well as in antioxidant and nucleic acid metabolism. Iron deficiency impairs these biological pathways, leading to oxidative stress and possibly carcinogenesis. Iron overload has been linked to genome instability as well as to cancer risk increase, as seen in hereditary hemochromatosis. Iron is an extremely reactive transition metal that can interact with hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals that form the 8-hydroxy-guanine adduct, cause point mutations as well as DNA single and double strand breaks. Iron overload also induces DNA hypermethylation and can reduce telomere length. The current Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDA) for iron, according with Institute of Medicine Dietary Reference Intake (DRI), is based in the concept of preventing anemia, and ranges from 7\u00a0mg/day to 18\u00a0mg/day depending on life stage and gender. Pregnant women need 27\u00a0mg/day. The maximum safety level for iron intake, the Upper Level (UL), is 40\u201345\u00a0mg/day, based on the prevention of gastrointestinal distress associated to high iron intakes. Preliminary evidence indicates that 20\u00a0mg/day iron, an intake slightly higher than the RDA, may reduce the risk of gastrointestinal cancer in the elderly as well as increasing genome stability in lymphocytes of children and adolescents. Current dietary recommendations do not consider the concept of genome stability which is of concern because damage to the genome has been linked to the origin and progression of many diseases and is the most fundamental pathology. Given the importance of iron for homeostasis and its potential influence over genome stability and cancer it is recommended to conduct further studies that conclusively define these relationships.",

     "abstract": "Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for humans, acting as a component of the unusual amino acids, selenocysteine (Se-Cys) and selenomethionine (Se-Met). Where Se levels are low, the cell cannot synthesise selenoproteins, although some selenoproteins and some tissues are prioritised over others. Characterised functions of known selenoproteins, include selenium transport (selenoprotein P), antioxidant/redox properties (glutathione peroxidases (GPxs), thioredoxin reductases and selenoprotein P) and anti-inflammatory properties (selenoprotein S and GPx4). Various forms of Se are consumed as part of a normal diet, or as a dietary supplement. Supplementation of tissue culture media, animal or human diets with moderate levels of certain Se compounds may protect against the formation of DNA adducts, DNA or chromosome breakage, and chromosome gain or loss. Protective effects have also been shown on mitochondrial DNA, and on telomere length and function. Some of the effects of Se compounds on gene expression may relate to modulation of DNA methylation or inhibition of histone deacetylation. Despite a large number of positive effects of selenium and selenoproteins in various model systems, there have now been some human clinical trials that have shown adverse effects of Se supplementation, according to various endpoints. Too much Se is as harmful as too little, with animal models showing a \u201cU\u201d-shaped efficacy curve. Current recommended daily allowances differ among countries, but are generally based on the amount of Se necessary to saturate GPx enzymes. However, increasing evidence suggests that other enzymes may be more important than GPx for Se action, that optimal levels may depend upon the form of Se being ingested, and vary according to genotype. New paradigms, possibly involving nutrigenomic tools, will be necessary to optimise the forms and levels of Se desirable for maximum protection of genomic stability in all humans.",

NOTCH3 consists of 33 exons which encode a protein of 2321 amino acids. Exons 3 and 4 were found to be mutation hotspots, containing more than 65% of all CADASIL mutations. We performed direct sequencing on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyser to screen for mutations and polymorphisms on 300 patients who were clinically suspected to have CADASIL. First, exons 3 and 4 were screened in NOTCH3 and if there were no variations found, then extended CADASIL testing (exons 2, 11, 18 and 19) was offered to patients. Here we report two novel non-synonymous mutations identified in the NOTCH3 gene. The first mutation, located in exon 4 was found in a 49-year-old female and causes an alanine to valine amino acid change at position 202 (605C\u00a0>\u00a0T). The second mutation, located in exon 11, was found in a 66-year-old female and causes a cysteine to arginine amino acid change at position 579 (1735T\u00a0>\u00a0C). We also report a 46-year-old male with a known polymorphism Thr101Thr (rs3815188) and an unreported polymorphism NM_000435.2:c.679+60G>A observed in intron 4 of the NOTCH3 gene. Although Ala202Ala (rs1043994) is a common polymorphism in the NOTCH3 gene, our reported novel mutation (Ala202Val) causes an amino acid change at the same locus. Our other reported mutation (Cys579Arg) correlates well with other known mutations in NOTCH3, as the majority of the CADASIL-associated mutations in NOTCH3 generally occur in the EGF-like (epidermal growth factor-like) repeat domain, causing a change in the number of cysteine residues. The intronic polymorphism NM_000435.2:c.679+60G>A lies close to the intron\u2013exon boundary and may affect the splicing mechanism in the NOTCH3 gene.",

Inhibition of PARP1 activity is considered a potentially important strategy in clinical practice, especially to sensitize tumor cells to chemo- and radio-therapy. Here we examined the influence of inhibition of PARP1 on formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and on DNA repair in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). K562 (human myelogenous leukaemia) cells were grown and exposed to 4 or 12\u00a0Gy of ionizing radiation in presence or absence of the PARP inhibitor NU1025 (100\u00a0\u03bcM). Intracellular ROS were assayed using the probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein with detection by flow cytometry and the rejoining of DNA strand breaks were followed by alkaline single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assays. In untreated cells a significant increase in PAR formation occurred during the first 5\u00a0min after IR, followed by a gradual decrease up to 30\u00a0min. Addition of a PARP inhibitor arrested the production of PAR almost completely and decreased the rate of rejoining of DNA strand breaks significantly; however, 3\u00a0h after irradiation we observed no difference in the amount of DNA strand breaks between PARP inhibitor-treated and untreated cells. Twelve to 48\u00a0h after irradiation, an increase of ROS concentration was observed in irradiated cells and ROS levels in PARP inhibitor-treated cells were significantly higher than in cells without inhibitor. Irradiated cells grown in the presence or absence of PARP inhibitor did not differ in the frequencies of apoptotic and necrotic cells or in the activity of caspases at 24, 48 and 72\u00a0h after irradiation. Poly(ADP-ribosylation) and inhibition of PARP1 appeared to modulate DNA strand break rejoining and influence the concentration of ROS in irradiated cells.",

Bufalin from the skin and parotid venom glands of toad has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in many types of cancer cell lines. However, there is no report addressing that bufalin induced cell death in human bladder cancer cells. The purpose of this study was investigated the mechanisms of bufalin-induced apoptosis in a human bladder cancer cell line (T24). We demonstrated the effects of bufalin on the cell growth and apoptosis in T24 cells by using DAPI/TUNEL double staining, a PI exclusion and flow cytometric analysis. The effects of bufalin on the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), the level of mitochondrial membrane potential (\u0394\u03a8m), and DNA content including sub-G1 (apoptosis) in T24 cells were also determined by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of G0/G1 phase-regulated and apoptosis-associated protein levels in bufalin-treated T24 cells. The results indicated that bufalin significantly decreased the percentage of viability, induced the G0/G1 phase arrest and triggered apoptosis in T24 cells. The down-regulation of the protein levels for cyclin D, CDK4, cyclin E, CDK2, phospho-Rb, phospho-AKT and Bcl-2 with the simultaneous up-regulation of the cytochrome c, Apaf-1, AIF, caspase-3, -7 and -9 and Bax protein expressions and caspase activities were observed in T24 cells after bufalin treatment. Based on our results, bufalin induces apoptotic cell death in T24 cells through suppressing AKT activity and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein as well as inducing pro-apoptotic Bax protein. The levels of caspase-3, -7 and -9 are also mediated apoptosis in bufalin-treated T24 cells.

In the present study we determined the mutagenicities of two- and three-lesion clustered damage sites containing a 1-nucleotide gap (GAP) and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine(s) (8-oxoG(s)) in Escherichia coli. The mutation frequencies (MFs) of bi-stranded two-lesion clusters (GAP/8-oxoG), especially in mutY-deficient strains, were high and were similar to those for bi-stranded clusters with 8-oxoG and base lesions/AP sites, suggesting that the GAP is processed with an efficiency similar to the efficiency of processing a base lesion or an AP site within a cluster. The MFs of tandem two-lesion clusters comprised of a GAP and an 8-oxoG on the same strand were comparable to or less than the MF of a single 8-oxoG. The mutagenic potential of three-lesion clusters, which were comprised of a tandem lesion (a GAP and an 8-oxoG) and an opposing single 8-oxoG, was higher than that of a single 8-oxoG, but was no more than that of a bi-stranded 8-oxoGs. We suggest that incorporation of a nucleotide opposite 8-oxoG is less mutagenic when a GAP is present in a cluster than when a GAP is absent. Our observations indicate that the repair of a GAP is retarded by an opposing 8-oxoG, but not by a tandem 8-oxoG, and that the extent of GAP repair determines the biological consequences.",

Incident cases of lung cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a051) and cancer free controls (n\u00a0=\u00a088) were recruited from a hospital bronchoscopy unit. Repair activity was determined in a nuclear extract of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, using a [32P]-based oligonucleotide cleavage assay (MPG substrate 5\u2032-CCGCT\u025bAGCGGGTACCGAGCTCGAAT; \u025bA\u00a0=\u00a0ethenoadenine). MPG activity was not related to sex or smoking status but was significantly higher in cases compared to controls (4.21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.67\u00a0fmol/\u03bcg DNA/h vs 3.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.35\u00a0fmol/\u03bcg DNA/h, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). After adjustment for age, sex, presence of chronic respiratory disease and smoking duration, patients in the highest tertile of MPG activity had a three fold increased probability of lung cancer (OR 3.00, 95% CI 1.16\u20137.75) when compared to those patients in the lowest tertile. These results suggest that elevated MPG activity is associated with lung cancer, possibly by creating an imbalance in the base excision repair pathway.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative damage to DNA can cause mutations, and mutations can lead to cancer. DNA repair of oxidative damage should therefore play a pivotal role in defending humans against cancer. This is exemplified by the increased risk of colorectal cancer of patients with germ-line mutations of the oxidative damage DNA glycosylase MUTYH. In contrast to germ-line mutations in DNA repair genes, which cause a strong deficiency in DNA repair activity in all cell types, the role of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in sporadic cancer is unclear also because deficiencies in DNA repair, if any, are expected to be much milder. Further slowing down progress are the paucity of accurate and reproducible functional assays and poor epidemiological design of many studies. This review will focus on the most common and widely studied SNPs of oxidative DNA damage repair proteins trying to bridge the information available on biochemical and structural features of the repair proteins with the functional effects of these variants and their potential impact on the pathogenesis of disease.",

To gain information of the mechanisms involved in the increased growth rate of HL60RG, we performed a multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH), standard cytogenetics analysis (G-banding) and genome scan using 10K SNP mapping array on both cell types. Characteristic genomic alterations in HL60RG cells were identified including uniparental disomy (UPD) of chromosome 1, and hemizygous deletion in 10p and 11p.

Candidate genes associated with the rapid growth of HL60RG cells were identified. Two tumor necrosis factor receptors, TNFRSF1B (type II tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 receptor) and TNFRSF8 (also known as a tumor marker CD30), which are adjacently located on chromosome 1 showed opposing changes in gene expression in HL60RG cells\u2014over-expression of TNFRSF8 and repression of TNFRSF1B. Differences in the DNA methylation status in the transcriptional regulatory regions of both genes between HL60 and HL60RG was detected by a methylation-specific PCR assay.

We have examined the genome wide transcriptional response of a culture of TPC-1 human cell line of papillary thyroid carcinoma origin with a RET/PTC1 translocation to various doses (0.0625, 0.5, and 4\u00a0Gy) of X-rays and compared it to response of thyroids with a RET/PTC3 translocation and against wild-type mouse thyroids irradiated with the same doses using Affymetrix microarrays. We have found considerable overlap at a high dose of 4\u00a0Gy in both RET/PTC-positive systems but no common genes at 62.5\u00a0mGy. In addition, the response of RET/PTC-positive system at all doses was distinct from the response of wild-type thyroids with both systems signaling down different pathways. Analysis of the response of microRNAs in TPC-1 cells revealed a radiation-responsive signature of microRNAs in addition to dose-responsive microRNAs. Our results point to the fact that a low dose of X-rays seems to have a significant proliferative effect on normal thyroids. This observation should be studied further as opposed to its effect on RET/PTC-positive thyroids which was subtle, anti-proliferative and system-dependent.",

Mutational analysis by plasmid rescue of Escherichia coli rpsL from irradiated Arabidopsis plants showed a 2.7-fold increase in mutant frequency for 113\u00a0keV/\u03bcm carbon ions, whereas no enhancement of mutant frequency was observed for carbon ions near the range end. This suggested that carbon ions near the range end induced mutations that were not recovered by plasmid rescue. An Arabidopsis DNA ligase IV mutant, deficient in non-homologous end-joining repair, showed hyper-sensitivity to both types of carbon-ion irradiation. The difference in radiation sensitivity between the wild type and the repair-deficient mutant was greatly diminished for carbon ions near the range end, suggesting that these ions induce irreparable DNA damage. Mutational analysis of the Arabidopsis GL1 locus showed that while the frequency of generation of glabrous mutant sectors was not different between the two types of carbon-ion irradiation, large deletions (>\u223c30\u00a0kb) were six times more frequently induced by carbon ions near the range end. When 352\u00a0keV/\u03bcm neon ions were used, these showed a 6.4 times increase in the frequency of induced large deletions compared with the 113\u00a0keV/\u03bcm carbon ions. We suggest that the proportion of large deletions increases with LET in plants, as has been reported for mammalian cells. The nature of mutations induced in plants by carbon ions near the range end is discussed in relation to mutation detection by plasmid rescue and transmissibility to progeny.",

Oxysterols have been identified in bile in the setting of chronic inflammation, suggesting that biliary epithelial cells are chronically exposed to these compounds in certain clinical settings. We hypothesized that biliary oxysterols resulting from liver fluke infection participate in cholangiocarcinogenesis. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, we identified oxysterols in livers from hamsters infected with Opisthorchis viverrini that develop cholangiocarcinoma. Five oxysterols were found: 7-keto-cholesta-3,5-diene (7KD), 3-keto-cholest-4-ene (3K4), 3-keto-cholest-7-ene (3K7), 3-keto-cholesta-4,6-diene (3KD), and cholestan-3\u03b2,5\u03b1,6\u03b2-triol (Triol). Triol and 3K4 were found at significantly higher levels in the livers of hamsters with O. viverrini-induced cholangiocarcinoma. We therefore investigated the effects of Triol and 3K4 on induction of cholangiocarcinogenesis using an in vitro human cholangiocyte culture model. Triol- and 3K4-treated cells underwent apoptosis. Western blot analysis showed significantly increased levels of Bax and decreased levels of Bcl-2 in these cells. Increased cytochrome c release from mitochondria was found following treatment with Triol and 3K4. Triol and 3K4 also induced formation of the DNA adducts 1,N6-etheno-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine, 3,N4-etheno-2\u2032-deoxycytidine and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine in cholangiocytes. The data suggest that Triol and 3K4 cause DNA damage via oxidative stress. Chronic liver fluke infection increases production of the oxysterols Triol and 3K4 in the setting of chronic inflammation in the biliary system. These oxysterols induce apoptosis and DNA damage in cholangiocytes. Insufficient and impaired DNA repair of such mutated cells may enhance clonal expansion and further drive the change in cellular phenotype from normal to malignant.",

N2O, sevoflurane and isoflurane were monitored by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry.The study documents for the first time the positive correlation between the oxidative DNA damage and the N2O levels in the ambient air. By contrast, no association was observed between genotoxic effects and sevoflurane or isoflurane. In addition, ROS generation and plasma and urine concentrations of TBARS and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1, respectively, were elevated, while GPX activity was reduced in nurses exposed to waste anaesthetic gases. Path analysis pointed to a causal relationship between N2O exposure, oxidative stress and DNA damage.Occupational exposure to N2O is associated with increased oxidative DNA damage and the level of exposure plays a critical role in this regard.

The micronucleus (MN) assay is useful in detecting chromosome damage induced by several factors. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of infection and malnutrition on the frequency of MN in erythrocytes from the peripheral blood of well-nourished, uninfected (WN) and well-nourished, infected (WNI) children, and moderately malnourished (UNM) and severely malnourished (UNS) children, both with infection, using a flow cytometric analysis technique. The percentage of reticulocytes (RETs) was significantly higher (1.5-fold) in WNI children than well-nourished controls. In addition, the UNS group had a 2.2-fold increase in the percentage of RETs compared to the WNI group. The frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RETs) was 2.5 times greater, in WNI group compared to the WN group. These frequencies were significantly higher (1.7- and 2.1-fold) in UNM and UNS, respectively, compared to the WNI group.

To further expand our knowledge about the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by BaP, we investigated the nuclear protein expression profiles in HeLa cells treated with different concentrations of BaP (0.1, 1, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM) using this proteomics-based 2-D gel electrophoresis assay.

The multiple, structure-specific nuclease activities of FEN1 allow it to process different intermediate DNA structures during DNA replication and repair. We previously identified a group of FEN1 mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms that impair FEN1's EXO and GEN activities in human cancer patients. We also established a mouse model carrying the E160D FEN1 mutation, which mimics the mutations seen in humans. FEN1 mutant mice developed spontaneous lung cancer at high frequency at their late life stages. An important unanswered question is whether individuals carrying such FEN1 mutation are more susceptible to tobacco smoke and have an earlier onset of lung cancer. Here, we report our study on E160D mutant mice exposed to benzo[\u03b1]pyrene (B[\u03b1]P), a major DNA damaging compound found in tobacco smoke. We demonstrate that FEN1 employs its GEN activity to cleave DNA bubble substrates with BP-induced lesions, but the E160D FEN1 mutation abolishes such activity. As a consequence, Mouse cells carrying the E160D mutation display defects in the repair of B[\u03b1]P adducts and accumulate DNA double-stranded breaks and chromosomal aberrations upon treatments with B[\u03b1]P. Furthermore, more E160D mice than WT mice have an early onset of B[\u03b1]P-induced lung adenocarcinoma.

To define genetic impacts of DPCs on eukaryotic cells in molecular terms, we used a sensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae frameshift-detection assay to analyze mutagenesis by formaldehyde (HCHO), and its response to nucleotide excision repair (NER) and translesion DNA synthesis (TLS). Brief exposure to HCHO was mutagenic for NER-defective rad14 strains but not for a corresponding RAD14 strain, nor for a rad14 strain lacking both Pol\u03b6 and Pol\u03b7 TLS polymerases. This confirmed that HCHO-generated DNA lesions can trigger error-prone TLS and are substrates for the NER pathway. Sequencing revealed that HCHO-induced single-base-pair insertions occurred primarily at one hotspot; most of these insertions were also complex, changing an additional base-pair nearby. Most of the HCHO-induced mutations required both Pol\u03b6 and Pol\u03b7, providing a striking example of cooperativity between these two TLS polymerases during bypass of a DNA lesion formed in vivo. The similar molecular properties of HCHO-induced and spontaneous complex +1 insertions detected by this system suggest that DPCs which form in vivo during normal metabolism may contribute characteristic events to the spectra of spontaneous mutations in NER-deficient cells.",

Here, we demonstrate that the link between CCM and DNA synthesis can be extended to the DNA replication fidelity, as we report changes of the mutator phenotypes of E. coli dnaQ49 and dnaX36 mutants (either suppression or enhancement) by dysfunctions of zwf, pta, ackA, acnB, and icdA genes. Overexpression of appropriate wild-type CCM genes in double mutants resulted in reversions to the initial mutator phenotypes, indicating that the effects were specific. Moreover, the observed suppression and enhancement effects were not caused by changes in bacterial growth rates.

Apoptosis in reporter PBM was measured by the Annexin V test using flow cytometry.Plasma collected from unirradiated and irradiated blood did not produce any apoptotic response above the control level in unirradiated reporter PBM. Surprisingly, plasma from irradiated blood caused a dose-dependent reduction of apoptosis in irradiated reporter PBM. The yields of radiation-induced cell death in irradiated reporter PBM (after subtracting the respective values in unirradiated reporter PBM) were 22.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8% in plasma-free cultures, 21.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1% in cultures treated with plasma from unirradiated blood, 20.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4% in cultures with plasma from blood given 2\u20134\u00a0Gy and 16.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2% in cultures with plasma from blood given 6\u201310\u00a0Gy.These results suggested that irradiated blood plasma did not cause a radiation-induced bystander cell-killing effect.

Using a transwell culture system, irradiated human melanoma (Me45) cells were co-cultured with non-irradiated Me45 cells or normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and vice versa. The frequency of micronuclei and of apoptosis, ROS level, and mitochondrial membrane potential were used as the endpoints. Irradiated Me45 and NHDF cells induced conventional bystander effects detected as modest increases of the frequency of micronuclei and apoptosis in both recipient neighbors; the increase of apoptosis was especially high in NHDF cells co-cultured with irradiated Me45 cells. However, the frequencies of micronuclei and apoptosis in irradiated Me45 cells co-cultured with NHDF cells were significantly reduced in comparison with those cultured alone. This protective effect was not observed when irradiated melanomas were co-cultured with non-irradiated cells of the same line, or when irradiated NHDF fibroblasts were co-cultured with bystander melanomas. The increase of micronuclei and apoptosis in irradiated Me45 cells was paralleled by an increase in the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), which was reduced significantly when they were co-cultured for 24\u00a0h with NHDF cells. A small but significant elevation of ROS level in NHDF cells shortly after irradiation was also reduced by co-culture with non-irradiated NHDF cells. We propose that in response to signals from irradiated cells, non-irradiated NHDF cells trigger rescue signals, whose nature remains to be elucidated, which modify the redox status in irradiated cells. This inverse bystander effect may potentially have implications in clinical radiotherapy.",

     "abstract": "The complexity of DNA lesions induced by ionizing radiation is mainly dependent on radiation quality, where the indirect action of radiation may contribute to different extent depending on the type of radiation under study. The effect of indirect action of radiation can be investigated by using agents that induce oxidative DNA damage or by applying free radical scavengers. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the indirect effect of radiation for the repair fidelity of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ), homologous recombination repair (HRR) and base excision repair (BER) when DNA damage of different complexity was induced by gamma radiation, alpha particles or from base damages (8-oxo-dG) induced by potassium bromate (KBrO3).CHO cells lines deficient in XRCC3 (HRR) irs1SF, XRCC7 (NHEJ) V3-3 and XRCC1 (BER) EM9 were irradiated in the absence or presence of the free radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The endpoints investigated included rate of cell proliferation by the DRAG assay, clonogenic cell survival and the level of primary DNA damage by the comet assay.The results revealed that the indirect effect of low-LET radiation significantly reduced the repair fidelity of both NHEJ and HRR pathways. For high-LET radiation the indirect effect of radiation also significantly reduced the repair fidelity for the repair deficient cell lines. The results suggest further that the repair fidelity of the error prone NHEJ repair pathway is more impaired by the indirect effect of high-LET radiation relative to the other repair pathways studied.The response to bromate observed for the two DSB repair deficient cell lines strongly support earlier studies that bromate induces complex DNA damages. The significantly reduced repair fidelity of irs1SF and V3-3 suggests that NHEJ as well as HRR are needed for the repair, and that complex DSBs are formed after bromate exposure.",

To this end, CHO cells were treated with a single concentration of BLM (2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), and the frequency of unstable chromosomal aberrations was determined at several times after treatment (18\u00a0h, and 6, 15 and 34/36 days) by using PNA-FISH with a pan-telomeric probe [(TTAGGG)n repeats]. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a higher frequency of aberrations at 18\u00a0h and 6 days after treatment in BLM-exposed cultures vs. untreated cultures, although the yield of BLM-induced aberrations decreased on average five times 6 days after treatment compared with the one induced 18\u00a0h after treatment. Moreover, no significant differences in the frequency of aberrations were observed between untreated and BLM-exposed cells at 15 or 34/36 days after treatment. These data indicate that, in terms of unstable aberrations, the in vitro clastogenic effect of BLM on CHO cells persists for at least 6 days but less than 15 days after exposure. In addition, we found that BLM induces ITSs instability, cytogenetically detectable as acentric fragments (18\u00a0h after treatment) or additional (new) FISH signals (6 days after treatment). We propose that the delayed effect of BLM on ITSs mainly results from breakage of heterochromatic ITSs blocks and further insertion of these sequences at the sites of monochromatid breaks occurring at G2 phase of the cell cycle, since most of the additional FISH signals were present as single dots and located at interstitial sites of the involved chromosomes.",

Biochemical and genetic studies showed that DSBs can also be joined via microhomology-mediated end joining (MHEJ), which is always mutagenic and may result in diseases, such as cancer. In this study we established a human cell-based reporter system to determine the prevalence of MHEJ events and factors that modulate MHEJ. A nonfunctional puromycin acetyltransferase (Pac) gene, disrupted by an insertion flanked by two microhomologous repeats, was integrated into chromosomes of human HT1080 cells. Repair of DSBs via MHEJ using the repeats resulted in deletion of the insertion and restoration of the Pac gene function, thus rendering the cells puromycin resistant. Our results showed that MHEJ spontaneously occurs at the reporter locus (loci), manifested by formation of puromycin resistant (puror) colonies after culturing reporter cells in medium containing puromycin. The frequency of puror cells can be greatly increased by site-directed DSB inside the insertion. Our results also demonstrated that the frequency of puror cells is affected by the length of the repeat and by the size of the intervening sequence. Thus, this cell-based assay provides a platform for evaluating factors modulating in vivo MHEJ.",

     "abstract": "The ends of chromosomes are composed of a short repeat sequence and associated proteins that together form a cap, called a telomere, that keeps the ends from appearing as double-strand breaks (DSBs) and prevents chromosome fusion. The loss of telomeric repeat sequences or deficiencies in telomeric proteins can result in chromosome fusion and lead to chromosome instability. The similarity between chromosome rearrangements resulting from telomere loss and those found in cancer cells implicates telomere loss as an important mechanism for the chromosome instability contributing to human cancer. Telomere loss in cancer cells can occur through gradual shortening due to insufficient telomerase, the protein that maintains telomeres. However, cancer cells often have a high rate of spontaneous telomere loss despite the expression of telomerase, which has been proposed to result from a combination of oncogene-mediated replication stress and a deficiency in DSB repair in telomeric regions. Chromosome fusion in mammalian cells primarily involves nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), which is the major form of DSB repair. Chromosome fusion initiates chromosome instability involving breakage\u2013fusion\u2013bridge (B/F/B) cycles, in which dicentric chromosomes form bridges and break as the cell attempts to divide, repeating the process in subsequent cell cycles. Fusion between sister chromatids results in large inverted repeats on the end of the chromosome, which amplify further following additional B/F/B cycles. B/F/B cycles continue until the chromosome acquires a new telomere, most often by translocation of the end of another chromosome. The instability is not confined to a chromosome that loses its telomere, because the instability is transferred to the chromosome donating a translocation. Moreover, the amplified regions are unstable and form extrachromosomal DNA that can reintegrate at new locations. Knowledge concerning the factors promoting telomere loss and its consequences is therefore important for understanding chromosome instability in human cancer.",

DC is now characterized molecularly by the presence of short age-adjusted telomeres. Mutations in seven genes have been unequivocally associated with DC, each with a role in telomere length maintenance. These observations, combined with knowledge that progressive telomere shortening can impose a proliferative barrier on dividing cells and contribute to chromosome instability, have led to the understanding that extreme telomere shortening drives the clinical features of DC. However, some of the genes implicated in DC encode proteins that are also components of H/ACA-ribonucleoprotein enzymes, which are responsible for the post-translational modification of ribosomal and spliceosomal RNAs, raising the question whether alterations in these activities play a role in the pathogenesis of DC. In addition, recent reports suggest that some cases of DC may not be characterized by short age-adjusted telomeres.

Several methods are available that provide this type of information and it is often not clear what method is most appropriate to address a specific research question. The major variables that need to be considered are the material that is or can be made available and the accuracy of measurements that is required. The goal of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the most commonly used methods and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each. Methods that start with genomic DNA include telomere restriction fragment (TRF) length analysis, PCR amplification of telomere repeats relative to a single copy gene by Q-PCR or MMQPCR and single telomere length analysis (STELA), a PCR-based approach that accurately measures the full spectrum of telomere lengths from individual chromosomes. A different set of methods relies on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect telomere repeats in individual cells or chromosomes. By including essential calibration steps and appropriate controls these methods can be used to measure telomere repeat length or content in chromosomes and cells. Such methods include quantitative FISH (Q-FISH) and flow FISH which are based on digital microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively. Here the basic principles of various telomere length measurement methods are described and their strengths and weaknesses are highlighted. Some recent developments in telomere length analysis are also discussed.

LTL at birth is evidently a major determinant of LTL throughout the human lifespan, such that individuals endowed with short (or long) LTL at birth probably have short (or long) LTL later in life. Therefore, the associations of short LTL with atherosclerosis and with diminished survival in the elderly may relate to short birth LTL, accelerated age-dependent LTL attrition, or both.

These iPS cells are capable of differentiating into all the tissue lineages when placed in the right environment and, in the case of mouse cells, can generate chimeric mice and be transmitted through the germline. Safer and more efficient methods of reprogramming are rapidly being developed. Clearly, iPS cells present a number of exciting possibilities, including disease modeling and therapy. A major question is whether the nuclei of iPS cells are truly rejuvenated or whether they might retain some of the marks of aging from the cells from which they were derived. One measure of cellular aging is the telomere. In this regard, recent studies have demonstrated that telomeres in iPS cells may be rejuvenated. They are not only elongated by reactivated telomerase but they are also epigenetically modified to be similar but not identical to embryonic stem cells. Upon differentiation, the derivative cells turn down telomerase, the telomeres begin to shorten again, and the telomeres and the genome are returned to an epigenetic state that is similar to normal differentiated somatic cells. While these preliminary telomere findings are promising, the overall genomic integrity of reprogrammed cells may still be problematic and further studies are needed to examine the safety and feasibility of using iPS cells in regenerative medicine applications.",

In humans mutations in the germ line can cause genetic disease. In somatic cells multiple rounds of mutations and selection lead to cancer. The study of genetic variation has progressed rapidly since the completion of the draft sequence of the human genome. Recent advances in sequencing technology, most importantly the introduction of massively parallel sequencing (MPS), have resulted in more than a hundred-fold reduction in the time and cost required for sequencing nucleic acids. These improvements have greatly expanded the use of sequencing as a practical tool for mutation analysis. While in the past the high cost of sequencing limited mutation analysis to selectable markers or small forward mutation targets assumed to be representative for the genome overall, current platforms allow whole genome sequencing for less than $5000. This has already given rise to direct estimates of germline mutation rates in multiple organisms including humans by comparing whole genome sequences between parents and offspring. Here we present a brief history of the field of mutation research, with a focus on classical tools for the measurement of mutation rates. We then review MPS, how it is currently applied and the new insight into human and animal mutation frequencies and spectra that has been obtained from whole genome sequencing. While great progress has been made, we note that the single most important limitation of current MPS approaches for mutation analysis is the inability to address low-abundance mutations that turn somatic tissues into mosaics of cells. Such mutations are at the basis of intra-tumor heterogeneity, with important implications for clinical diagnosis, and could also contribute to somatic diseases other than cancer, including aging. Some possible approaches to gain access to low-abundance mutations are discussed, with a brief overview of new sequencing platforms that are currently waiting in the wings to advance this exploding field even further.",

Then, we further verified the levels of mutagenesis by using the pSP189 shuttle vector in A549 human lung carcinoma cells. We demonstrated that TCHQ causes significant genotoxicity by inducing DNA breakage and forming DNA adducts. Additionally, DNA sequence analysis of the TCHQ-induced mutations revealed that 85.36% were single base substitutions, 9.76% were single base insertions, and 4.88% were large fragment deletions. More than 80% of the base substitutions occurred at G:C base pairs, and the mutations were G:C to C:G, G:C to T:A or G:C to A:T transversions and transitions.

Any alteration in DNA repair efficacy would play a dominant role in progression of squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN).Genotypes of XRCC1 gene\u2013Arg194Trp, Arg280His, Arg399Gln and XPD Lys751Gln, by PCR-RFLP were studied in 278 SCCHN patients and an equal number of matched healthy controls residing in north India.In XRCC1 polymorphisms, Arg194Trp and Arg399Gln variants showed a reduced risk, whereas, XPD Lys751Gln variants exhibited \u223c2-fold increase in SCCHN risk. With XRCC1-Arg280His variants, there was no association with SCCHN risk. Arg399Gln of XRCC1 appears to have a protective role in people those consume alcohol, while XPD Lys751Gln variants indicated \u223c2-fold increased risk of SCCHN in all the co-variate groups.Comparison of gene\u2013gene interaction among XRCC1 Arg280His and XPD Lys751Gln suggested enhanced risk of SCCHN by \u223c2.3-fold in group one and \u223c6.1-fold in group two. In dichotomized groups of this combination, the risk was \u223c2.4 times. Haplotype analysis revealed the frequency of C\u2013G\u2013G\u2013G and C\u2013A\u2013G\u2013G to be significantly associated with an increased risk of SCCHN. On the contrary, T\u2013G\u2013A\u2013A significantly diminished the risk. CART analysis results showed that the terminal node that contains homozygous mutants of XPD Lys751Gln and XRCC1 Arg194Trp, wild type of XRCC1 Arg399Gln and homozygous mutant of XRCC1 Arg280His, represent the highest risk group.Our results demonstrate high degree of gene\u2013gene interaction involving DNA repair genes of NER and BER pathways, namely XRCC1 and XPD. This study amply demonstrates positive association of XPD Arg751Gln polymorphism with an increased risk of SCCHN. Further, XRCC1 Arg280His variant though dormant individually, may also contribute to the development of cancer in combination with XPD Arg751Gln.",

     "abstract": "When damage is inflicted in nuclear DNA, cells activate a hierarchical plethora of proteins that constitute the DNA damage response machinery. In contrast to the cell nucleus, the ability of micronuclear DNA lesions to activate this complex network is controversial. In order to determine whether the DNA contained in micronuclei is protected by the cellular damage response system, we studied the recruitment of excision repair factors to photolesions inflicted in the DNA of radiation-induced micronuclei. To perform this analysis, primary human dermal fibroblasts were exposed to UV-C light to induce photolesions in nuclear and micronuclear DNA. By means of immunofluorescence techniques, we observed that most micronuclei were devoid of NER factors. We conclude that UV photoproducts in micronuclei are mostly unable to generate an effective DNA damage response. We observed that the micronuclear envelope structure is a determinant factor that influences the repair of the DNA lesions inside micronuclei. Therefore, our results allow us to conclude that photolesions in radiation-induced micronuclei are poorly processed because the repair factors are unable to reach the micronuclear chromatin when a micronucleus is formed or after a genotoxic insult.",

To specify the role of SOS DNA polymerases in HNE-induced mutations, we tested survival and mutation spectra in the lacZ\u03b1 gene of M13mp18 phage, whose DNA was treated in vitro with HNE, and which was grown in uvrA\u2212Escherichia coli strains, carrying one, two or all three SOS DNA polymerases. When Pol IV was the only DNA SOS polymerase in the bacterial host, survival of HNE-treated M13 DNA was similar to, but mutation frequency was lower than in the strain containing all SOS DNA polymerases. When only Pol II or Pol V were present in host bacteria, phage survival decreased dramatically. Simultaneously, mutation frequency was substantially increased, but exclusively in the strain carrying only Pol V, suggesting that induction of mutations by HNE is mainly dependent on Pol V. To determine the role of Pol II and Pol IV in HNE induced mutagenesis, Pol II or Pol IV were expressed together with Pol V. This resulted in decrease of mutation frequency, suggesting that both enzymes can compete with Pol V, and bypass HNE-DNA adducts in an error-free manner. However, HNE-DNA adducts were easily bypassed by Pol IV and only infrequently by Pol II.Mutation spectrum established for strains expressing only Pol V, showed that in uvrA\u2212 bacteria the frequency of base substitutions and recombination increased in relation to NER proficient strains, particularly mutations at adenine sites.

We exposed HUVECs to X-ray radiation and studied effects of ecDNAR isolated from the culture media conditioned by the short-term incubation of irradiated cells on intact HUVECs. Effects of ecDNAR produced by irradiated cells on ROS and NO production in non-irradiated HUVECs are similar to bystander effect. These effects at least partially depend on TLR9 signaling. We compared the production of the nitric oxide and the ROS in human endothelial cells that were (1) irradiated at a low dose; (2) exposed to the ecDNAR extracted from the media conditioned by irradiated cells; and (3) exposed to human DNA oxidized in vitro.

     "abstract": "We previously demonstrated that exonic selectivity for frameshift mutation (exon 10 over exon 3) of ACVR2 in mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient cells is partially determined by 6 nucleotides flanking 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 of each microsatellite. Substitution of flanking nucleotides surrounding the exon 10 microsatellite with those surrounding the exon 3 microsatellite greatly diminished heteroduplex (A7/T8) and full (A7/T7) mutation, while substitution of flanking nucleotides from exon 3 with those from exon 10 enhanced frameshift mutation. We hypothesized that specific individual nucleotide(s) within these flanking sequences control ACVR2 frameshift mutation rates. Only the 3rd nucleotide 5\u2032 of the microsatellite, and 3rd, 4th, and 5th nucleotides 3\u2032 of the microsatellite were altered from the native flanking sequences and these locations were individually altered (sites A, B, C, and D, respectively).

Non-fluorescent cells were sorted, cultured for 35 days, and harvested for flow cytometry and DNA-sequencing. Site A (C to T) and B (G to C) in ACVR2 exon 10 decreased both heteroduplex and full mutant as much as the construct containing all 4 alterations. For ACVR2 exon 3, site A (T to C), C (A to G), and D (G to C) are responsible for increased heteroduplex formation, whereas site D is responsible for full mutant formation by ACVR2 exon 10 flanking sequences.

     "abstract": "Epidemiological studies have shown an association between consumption of disinfected drinking water and adverse health outcomes. The chemicals used to disinfect water react with occurring organic matter and anthropogenic contaminants in the source water, resulting in the formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs). The observations that some DBPs are carcinogenic in animal models have raised public concern over the possible adverse health effects for humans. Here, the modulation of liver cytochrome P450-linked monooxygenases (MFO) and the genotoxic effects in erythrocytes of Cyprinus carpio fish exposed in situ to surface drinking water in the presence of disinfectants, such as sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and peracetic acid (PAA), were investigated in winter and summer. A complex induction/suppression pattern of CYP-associated MFOs in winter was observed for all disinfectants. For example, a 3.4- to 15-fold increase was recorded of the CYP2B1/2-linked dealkylation of penthoxyresorufin with NaClO (10 days) and PAA (20 days). In contrast, ClO2 generated the most notable inactivation, the CYP2E1-supported hydroxylation of p-nitrophenol being decreased up to 71% after 10 days\u2019 treatment. In summer, the degree of modulation was modest, with the exception of CYP3A1/2 and CYP1A1 supported MFOs (62% loss after 20 days PAA).The micronucleus (MN) induction in fish circulating erythrocytes was also analysed as an endpoint of genotoxic potential in the same fish population. Significant increases of MN induction were detected at the latest sampling time on fish exposed to surface water treated with chlorinate-disinfectants, both in winter (NaClO) and summer (NaClO and ClO2), while no effect was observed in fish exposed to PAA-treated water.These results show that water disinfection may be responsible for harmful outcomes in terms of MFO perturbation and DNA damage; if extrapolated to humans, they ultimately offer a possible rationale for the increased urinary cancer risk recorded in regular drinking water consumers.",

     "abstract": "In the present study the possible involvement of telomeres in chromosomal instability of breast tumors and cell lines from BRCA2 mutation carriers was examined. Breast tumors from BRCA2 mutation carriers showed significantly higher frequency of chromosome end-to-end fusions (CEFs) than tumors from non-carriers despite normal telomere DNA content. Frequent CEFs were also found in four different BRCA2 heterozygous breast epithelial cell lines, occasionally with telomere signal at the fusion point, indicating telomere capping defects. Extrachromosomal telomeric repeat (ECTR) DNA was frequently found scattered around metaphase chromosomes and interstitial telomere sequences (ITSs) were also common. Telomere sister chromatid exchanges (T-SCEs), characteristic of cells using alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), were frequently detected in all heterozygous BRCA2 cell lines as well as the two ALT positive cell lines tested. Even though T-SCE frequency was similar in BRCA2 heterozygous and ALT positive cell lines they differed in single telomere signal loss and ITSs. Chromatid type alterations were more prominent in the BRCA2 heterozygous cell lines that may have propensity for telomere based chromosome healing. Telomere dysfunction-induced foci (TIFs) formation, identified by co-localization of telomeres and \u03b3-H2AX, supported telomere associated DNA damage response in BRCA2 heterozygous cell lines. TIFs were found in interphase nuclei, at chromosome ends, ITSs and ECTR DNA. In conclusion, our results suggest that BRCA2 has an important role in telomere stabilization by repressing CEFs through telomere capping and the prevention of telomere loss by replication stabilization.",

Epigenetic modifications of satellite sequences and their consequences have not been extensively studied in human cells. In the present work, we evaluated satellite 2 methylation patterns in human lymphocytes exposed to 5-azacytidine (5-azaC) and assessed the relationship between these patterns and chromosome missegregation. Human lymphocytes were exposed to 10\u00a0\u03bcM 5-azaC for 24, 48, and 72\u00a0h. Segregation errors were evaluated in binucleate cells using FISH against pericentromeric regions of chromosomes 1, 9, and 16. DNA methylation patterns were evaluated by immunodetection, and by bisulfite plus urea conversion and sequencing. We have identified that 5-azaC induced missegregation of chromosomes 1 and 16, which have highly methylated satellite 2, after 72\u00a0h of exposure. Chromosome methylation patterns showed a notable decrease in pericentromeric methylation. Bisulfite conversion and sequencing analysis demonstrated demethylation of satellite 2 associated to 5-azaC exposure, principally after 72\u00a0h of treatment. This change occurred in a non-specific pattern. Our study demonstrates an association between loss of satellite 2 DNA methylation and chromosome loss in human lymphocytes.",

The goals of the present study were to evaluate the dose responsiveness to CS and the persistence of microRNA alterations after smoking cessation. ICR (CD-1) neonatal mice were exposed whole-body to mainstream CS, at the doses of 119, 292, 438, and 631\u00a0mg/m3 of total particulate matter. Exposure started within 12\u00a0h after birth and continued daily for 4 weeks. The levels of bulky DNA adducts and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodGuo) were measured by 32P postlabeling procedures, and the expression of 697 mouse microRNAs was analyzed by microarray. The highest CS dose was lethal. Exposure to CS caused a dose-dependent increase of DNA alterations. DNA adducts and, even more sharply, 8-oxodGuo were reverted 1 and 4 weeks after smoking cessation. Exposure to CS resulted in an evident dysregulation of microRNA expression profiles, mainly in the sense of downregulation. The two lowest doses were not particularly effective, while the highest nonlethal dose produced extensive microRNA alterations. The expression of most downregulated microRNAs, including among others 7 members of the let-7 family, was restored one week after smoking cessation. However, the recovery was incomplete for a limited array of microRNAs, including mir-34b, mir-345, mir-421, mir-450b, mir-466, and mir-469. Thus, it appears that microRNAs mainly behave as biomarkers of effect and that exposure to high-dose, lasting for an adequate period of time, is needed to trigger the CS-related carcinogenesis process in the experimental animal model used.",

Further on, we evaluated microRNA alterations at a later stage, when lung tumors were detectable in MCS-exposed mice. Lung samples were available from previous studies, in which strain H mice had been exposed to MCS for 4 months, starting immediately after birth, and then kept in filtered air for an additional 3 months. Some samples were from MCS-exposed mice treated either with N-acetyl-l-cysteine during pregnancy or with phenethyl isothiocyanate after weaning. The analysis of 576 mouse microRNAs showed that MCS strongly dysregulated microRNA expression and that both chemopreventive agents efficiently attenuated this trend, especially in noncancer tissue. MicroRNA expression was affected by histopathology, with specific signatures related to occurrence of pneumonia, adenoma, or bronchoalveolar carcinoma. Within pairs of samples from individual mice, microRNA analysis discriminated adenomatous tissue and especially carcinomatous tissue from the surrounding normal appearing tissue. A series of microRNA alterations characterized the sequential stages of pulmonary carcinogenesis. The involved functions included oncogene activation, inhibition of oncosuppressor genes, recruitment of undifferentiated stem cells, inflammation, inhibition of gap-junctional intercellular communications, angiogenesis, invasiveness, and metastatization. Thus, microRNA expression profiles in lung are dysregulated by MCS along all steps of the carcinogenesis process and depend on the interplay among exposure to noxious agents, treatment with dietary and pharmacological agents, and occurrence of pulmonary diseases.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to provide an update of the current understanding on the role of microRNAs in mediating genetic responses to air pollutants and to contemplate on how these responses ultimately control susceptibility to ambient air pollution. Morbidity and mortality attributable to air pollution continues to be a growing public health concern worldwide. Despite several studies on the health effects of ambient air pollution, underlying molecular mechanisms of susceptibility and disease remain elusive. In the last several years, special attention has been given to the role of epigenetics in mediating, not only genetic and physiological responses to certain environmental insults, but also in regulating underlying susceptibility to environmental stressors. Epigenetic mechanisms control the expression of gene products, both basally and as a response to a perturbation, without affecting the sequence of DNA itself. These mechanisms include structural regulation of the chromatin structure, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, and post-transcriptional gene regulation, such as microRNA mediated repression of gene expression. microRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that have been quickly established as key regulators of gene expression. As such, miRNAs have been found to control several cellular processes including apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation. More recently, research has emerged suggesting that changes in the expression of some miRNAs may be critical for mediating biological, and ultimately physiological, responses to air pollutants. Although the study of microRNAs, and epigenetics as a whole, has come quite far in the field of cancer, the understanding of how these mechanisms regulate gene\u2013environment interactions to environmental exposures in everyday life is unclear.

     "abstract": "Many carcinogenic agents such as ultra-violet light from the sun and various natural and man-made chemicals act by damaging the DNA. To deal with these potentially detrimental effects of DNA damage, cells induce a complex DNA damage response (DDR) that includes DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, damage tolerance systems and apoptosis. This DDR is a potent barrier against carcinogenesis and defects within this response are observed in many, if not all, human tumors. DDR defects fuel the evolution of precancerous cells to malignant tumors, but can also induce sensitivity to DNA damaging agents in cancer cells, which can be therapeutically exploited by the use of DNA damaging treatment modalities. Regulation of and coordination between sub-pathways within the DDR is important for maintaining genome stability. Although regulation of the DDR has been extensively studied at the transcriptional and post-translational level, less is known about post-transcriptional gene regulation by microRNAs, the topic of this review. More specifically, we highlight current knowledge about DNA damage responsive microRNAs and microRNAs that regulate DNA damage response genes. We end by discussing the role of DNA damage response microRNAs in cancer etiology and sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other DNA damaging therapeutic agents.",

     "abstract": "During the recent few years, microRNAs emerged as key molecules in the regulation of mammalian cell functions. It was also shown that their altered expression can promote pathologic conditions, such as cancer and other common diseases. Because environmental exposure to biological, chemical or physical agents may be responsible for human diseases, including cancer, uncovering relationships between exposure to environmental carcinogens and expression of microRNAs may help to disclose early mechanisms of disease and it may potentially lead to the development of useful indicators of toxic exposure or novel biomarkers for carcinogenicity testing. The unique expression profile of microRNAs in different types and at different stages of cancer coupled to their remarkable stability in tissues and in serum/plasma suggests that these little molecules may find application as sensitive biomarkers. This review will concentrate on the alterations in microRNA expression in response to environmental factors in relation to the risk of developing liver cancer.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) belong to the heterogeneous class of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that regulate the translation and degradation of target mRNAs, and control approximately 30% of human genes. MiRNA genes might be silenced in human tumors (oncomiRs) by aberrant hypermethylation of CpG islands that encompass or lie adjacent to miRNA genes and/or by histone modifications. We performed literature search for research articles describing epigenetically regulated miRNAs in cancer and identified 45 studies that were published between 2006 and 7/2010. The data from those papers are fragmented and methodologically heterogeneous and our work represents first systematic review towards to integration of diverse sets of information.We reviewed the methods used for detection of miRNA epigenetic regulation, which comprise bisulfite genomic sequencing PCR (BSP), bisulfite pyrosequencing, methylation specific PCR (MSP), combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA), methylation sensitive single nucleotide primer extension (Ms-SNuPE), MassARRAY technique and some modifications of those methods. This integrative study revealed 122 miRNAs that were reported to be epigenetically regulated in 23 cancer types. Compared to protein coding genes, human oncomiRs showed an order of magnitude higher methylation frequency (11.6%; 122/1048 known miRNAs). Nearly half, (45%; 55/122) epigenetically regulated miRNAs were associated with different cancer types, but other 55% (67/122) miRNAs were present in only one cancer type and therefore representing cancer-specific biomarker potential. The data integration revealed miRNA epigenomic hot spots on the chromosomes 1q, 7q, 11q, 14q and 19q. CpG island analysis of corresponding miRNA precursors (pre-miRNAs) revealed that 20% (26/133) of epigenetically regulated miRNAs had a CpG island within the range of 5\u00a0kb upstream, among them 14% (19/133) of miRNAs resided within the CpG island. Our integrative survey and analyses revealed candidate cancer-specific miRNA epigenetic signatures which provide the basis for new therapeutic strategies in cancer by targeting the epigenetic regulation of miRNAs.",

Herein we show that the phenomenon of RNA-mediated DNA modification and repair is not limited to yeast cells. A tract of six ribonucleotides embedded in single-strand DNA oligos corresponding to either lagging or leading strand sequences could serve as a template to correct a defective lacZ marker gene in the chromosome of the bacterium Escherichia coli. In order to test the capacity of RNA to modify DNA in mammalian cells, we utilized DNA oligos containing an embedded tract of six ribonucleotides, as well as oligos mostly made of RNA. These oligos were designed to repair a chromosomal break generated within a copy of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene randomly integrated into the genome of human HEK-293 cells. We show that these RNA-containing oligos can serve as templates to repair a DSB in human cells and can introduce base changes into genomic or plasmid DNA. In both E. coli and human cells, the strand bias of chromosomal gene correction by the single-strand RNA-containing oligos was the same as that obtained for the corresponding DNA molecules. Therefore, the RNA-containing oligos are not converted into a cDNA before annealing with complementary DNA. Overall, we demonstrate that in both bacterial and human cells, as in yeast, RNA sequences can have a direct role in DNA genetic modification and remodeling.",

     "abstract": "Intracellular RNAses are involved in various functions, including microRNA maturation and turnover. Mutations occurring in genes encoding RNAses cause Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e9res syndrome (AGS). AGS mutations silence RNAse activity, thus inducing accumulation of endogenous RNAs, mainly consisting of short RNAs and microRNAs. Overload of intracellular RNA triggers Toll like receptor-dependent interferon-alpha production in the brain, which in turn activates neurotoxic lymphocytes and inhibits angiogenesis thus inducing the typical clinical phenotype of AGS. However, these pathogenic mechanisms are attenuated after three years of age by the endogenous production of DNAJP58IPK and Cystatin F, which arrest AGS progression. Because RNAses are involved in microRNA turnover, we evaluated the expression of 957 microRNAs in lymphocytes from AGS patients and control patients. Our results indicate that microRNA overload occurs in AGS patients. This upregulation inhibits microRNA turnover impeding the synthesis of the novel microRNAs required for the differentiation and myelination of the brain during the initial period of postnatal life. These pathogenic mechanisms result in AGS, a neurological syndrome characterized by irritability, mild hyperpyrexia, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, and spastic-dystonic tetraplegia. Typical cerebrospinal fluid alterations include lymphocytosis and elevated interferon-alpha levels. Brain imaging demonstrates cerebral calcifications, white matter abnormalities, and progressive cerebral atrophy.Thus, evidence exists that mutations silencing intracellular RNases affect microRNA turnover resulting in the severe clinical consequences in the brain characterizing the clinical feature of AGS.",

Since the sequence complementarity and the thermodynamics of binding play an essential role in the interaction of miRNA with its target mRNA, sequence variations in the miRNA-binding seed regions or in miRNA genes (either within pre-, pri-, or mature miRNA regions) should reinforce, weaken, or disrupt the miRNA\u2013mRNA interaction and affect the expression of mRNA targets. Indirect evidences supporting these hypotheses are reported in the literature, essentially coming from case\u2013control association studies. Several studies have been published on the association between miR-SNPs or SNPs within their binding sites and the risk of oesophageal, gastric, or colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, functional studies are lacking. Besides reviewing the available literature, we present here for the first time two SNPs (rs17281995 in CD86 and rs1051690 in INSR) previously associated with the risk of CRC in a Czech population are also associated with the risk in a Spanish population. Moreover, we show for the first time that both these alleles regulate differentially the amount of a reporter gene (luciferase) in an in vitro assay on HeLa cells. These findings suggest that both these SNPs may have a functional role in regulating the expression of CD-86 and INSR proteins acting at the level of the 3\u2032UTR. More functional studies are needed in order to better understand the role of polymorphic regulatory sequences at the 3\u2032UTR of genes.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to environmental mutagens results in alteration of microRNA expression mainly oriented towards down-regulation, as typically observed in cigarette smoke. However, the molecular mechanism triggering this event is still unknown. To shed light on this issue, we developed an \u2018in silico\u2019 analysis testing 25 established environmental mutagens (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic compounds, nitrosoamines, morpholine, ethylnitrosurea, benzene derivatives, hydroxyl amines, alkenes) for their potential to interfere with the function of DICER, the enzyme involved in the cytoplasmic phase of microRNA maturation. In order to analyse the binding affinity between DICER and each mutagen, the three-dimensional bioinformatic structures of DICER-RNase III domains and of mutagens have been constructed. The binding affinity of mutagens for each DICER's RNase III domain was estimated by calculating the global contact-energy and the number of intermolecular contacts. These two parameters reflect the stability of the DICER\u2013mutagen complexes. All the 25 mutagens tested form stable complexes with DICER, 20 of which form a complex with DICER A domain, that is more stable than those formed by DICER with its natural substrate, i.e. double strand short RNAs. These mutagens are benzo(a)pyrene diol epoxide, nitroimidazoles, fluorenes, naphthalene, morpholine, stilbenes, hydroxylamines, fecapentenes. In the case of exposure to mutagen mixtures (benzo(a)pyrene-diolepoxide and 4-acetylaminostilbene), synergistic or less than addictive effects occur depending on the docking order of the compounds. A group of 8 mutagens with the highest ability to interfere with this DICER function, was identified by hierarchical cluster analysis. This group included 1-ethyl-1-nitrosourea and 4-nitrosomorpholine.Herein, presented data support the view that mutagens interfere with microRNA maturation by binding DICER. This finding sheds light on a new epigenetic mechanism exerted by environmental mutagens in inducing cell damage.",

We demonstrated that microwave (MW) exposure at the water resonance frequency was able to induce alteration of the mitotic apparatus and apoptosis as a function of the applied power densities (5 and 10\u00a0mW/cm2), together with a moderate reduction in the rate of cell division. After an exposure time of 15\u00a0min the proportion of aberrant spindles and of apoptotic cells was significantly increased, while the mitotic index decreased as well, as compared to the untreated V79 cells. Additionally, in order to understand if the observed effects were due to RF exposure per se or to a thermal effect, V79 cells were also treated in thermostatic bath mimicking the same temperature increase recorded during microwave emission. The effect of temperature on the correct assembly of mitotic spindles was negligible up to 41\u00a0\u00b0C, while apoptosis was induced only when the medium temperature achieved 40\u00a0\u00b0C, thus exceeding the maximum value registered during MW exposure. We hypothesise that short-time MW exposures at the water resonance frequency cause, in V79 cells, reversible alterations of the mitotic spindle, this representing, in turn, a pro-apoptotic signal for the cell line.",

The aim of the current study was to determine the signaling differences between \u03b3-rays and carbon ion-irradiation. A549 cells were irradiated with 1\u00a0Gy carbon or \u03b3-rays. Carbon beam was found to be three times more cytotoxic than \u03b3-rays despite the fact that the numbers of \u03b3-H2AX foci were same. Percentage of cells showing ATM/ATR foci were more with \u03b3-rays however number of foci per cell were more in case of carbon irradiation. Large BRCA1 foci were found in all carbon irradiated cells unlike \u03b3-rays irradiated cells and prosurvival ERK pathway was activated after \u03b3-rays irradiation but not carbon. The noteworthy finding of this study is the early phase apoptosis induction by carbon ions. In the present study in A549 lung adenocarcinoma, authors conclude that despite activation of same repair molecules such as ATM and BRCA1, differences in low and high LET damage responses might be due to their distinct macromolecular complexes rather than their individual activation and the activation of cytoplasmic pathways such as ERK, whether it applies to all the cell lines need to be further explored.",

     "abstract": "The centrosome is a cytoplasmic organelle which duplicates once during each cell cycle, and the presence of excess centrosomes promote chromosome instability through chromosome missegregation following cytokinesis. Ionizing radiation (IR) can induce extra centrosomes by permitting the continuation of CDK2/Cyclin-A/E-mediated centrosome duplication when cells are arrested in the cell cycle after irradiation. The work described here shows that, in addition to IR, extra centrosomes were induced in human U2OS and mouse NIH3T3 cells after treatment with agents which include DNA adduct-forming chemicals: benzopyrene (BP), 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO), a DNA cross linker: cis-diamminedichloro-platinum (cisplatin), topoisomerase inhibitors: camptothecin, etoposide, genistein, and ultra-violet light (UV). These agents were divided into two categories with respect to the regulation of p21, which is an inhibitor of CDK2/Cyclin-A/E: specifically, p21 was up-regulated by an IR exposure and treatment with topoisomerase inhibitors. However, UV, BP, 4NQO and cisplatin down-regulated p21 below basal levels. When cells were irradiated with IR in combination with all of these agents, except genistein, enhanced induction of extra centrosomes was observed, regardless of the nature of p21 expression. Genistein significantly suppressed the frequency of IR-induced extra centrosomes in a dose-dependent manner, and 20\u00a0\u03bcg/ml of genistein reduced this frequency to 66%. Consistent with this, genistein substantially up-regulated p21 expression over the induction caused by IR alone, while other agents down-regulated or marginally affected this. This suggests the inhibitory effect of genistein on the induction of extra centrosomes occurs through the inactivation of CDK2/Cyclin-A/E via p21 up-regulation. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that p21 knockdown with siRNA reduced the activity of CDK2/Cyclin-A/E and restored the enhanced effect of a combined treatment with genistein and IR. These results demonstrate the preventive effect of genistein and a crucial role for p21 in IR-induced excess centrosomes.",

     "abstract": "One of the key issues of current radiation research is the biological effect of low doses. Unfortunately, low dose science is hampered by the unavailability of easily performable, reliable and sensitive quantitative biomarkers suitable detecting low frequency alterations in irradiated cells. We applied a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) based protocol detecting common deletions (CD) in the mitochondrial genome to assess direct and non-targeted effects of radiation in human fibroblasts. In directly irradiated (IR) cells CD increased with dose and was higher in radiosensitive cells. Investigating conditioned medium-mediated bystander effects we demonstrated that low and high (0.1 and 2\u00a0Gy) doses induced similar levels of bystander responses and found individual differences in human fibroblasts. The bystander response was not related to the radiosensitivity of the cells. The importance of signal sending donor and signal receiving target cells was investigated by placing conditioned medium from a bystander response positive cell line (F11-hTERT) to bystander negative cells (S1-hTERT) and vice versa. The data indicated that signal sending cells are more important in the medium-mediated bystander effect than recipients. Finally, we followed long term effects in immortalized radiation sensitive (S1-hTERT) and normal (F11-hTERT) fibroblasts up to 63 days after IR. In F11-hTERT cells CD level was increased until 35 days after IR then reduced back to control level by day 49. In S1-hTERT cells the increased CD level was also normalized by day 42, however a second wave of increased CD incidence appeared by day 49 which was maintained up to day 63 after IR. This second CD wave might be the indication of radiation-induced instability in the mitochondrial genome of S1-hTERT cells.

The circular, multi-copy mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is used as a sensitive surrogate to oxidative DNA damage. We demonstrate that exogenous H2O2 induces preferential cytotoxicity in aggressive prostate cancer than normal cells; a cascade production of cellular ROS, composed mainly of superoxide (O2\u2212), is shown to be a critical determinant of H2O2-induced selective toxicity in cancer cells. In contrast, mtDNA damage and copy number depletion, as measured by a novel two-phase strategy of the supercoiling-sensitive qPCR method, are very sensitive to exogenous H2O2 exposure in both cancer and normal cell lines. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the sensitive mtDNA damage response to exogenous H2O2 is independent of secondary cellular ROS production triggered by several ROS modulators regardless of cell phenotypes.

     "abstract": "Tobacco smoking is one of the major risk factors in pathogenesis of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). Many of the chemical compounds present in tobacco are well-known carcinogens which form adducts with DNA. Cells remove these adducts mainly by the nucleotide excision repair pathway (NER). NER also eliminates a broad spectrum of pyrimidine dimers (CPD) and photo-products (6-4PP) induced by UV-radiation or DNA cross-links after cisplatin anti-cancer treatment. In this study DNA damage and repair was examined in peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from 20 HNSCC patients and 20 healthy controls as well as HTB-43 larynx and SSC-25 tongue cancer cell lines. DNA repair kinetics in the examined cells after cisplatin or UV-radiation treatment were investigated using alkaline comet assay during 240\u00a0min of post-treatment incubation. MTT assay was used to analyse cell viability and the Annexin V-FITC kit specific for kinase-3 was employed to determine apoptosis after treating the cells with UV-radiation at dose range from 0.5 to 60\u00a0J/m2. NER capability was assessed in vitro with cell extracts by the use of a bacterial plasmid irradiated with UV-light as a substrate for the repair. The results show that lymphocytes from HNSCC patients and HTB-43 or SSC-25 cancer cells were more sensitive to genotoxic treatment with UV-radiation and displayed impaired DNA repair. Also evidenced was a higher rate of apoptosis induction after UV-radiation treatment of lymphocytes from the HNSCC patients and the HTB-43 cancer cells than after treatment of those from healthy donors. Finally, our results showed that there was a significant decrease in NER capacity in HTB-43 or SSC-25 cancer cells as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes of HNSCC patients compared to controls. In conclusion, we suggest that the impaired NER pathway might be a critical factor in pathogenesis of head and neck cancer.",

Rats were gavaged with the radioactive mutagen 14C-labelled IQ (2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline), and effects of the brans on plasma radioactivity measured. Compared with the control diet, all bran-supplemented diets reduced the concentration of radioactivity in plasma, in the order ARF\u00a0>\u00a0PRF\u00a0>\u00a0WB. All brans increased faecal elimination of radioactivity, but only ARF and PRF enhanced urinary radioactivity. These data suggest that wheat bran may reduce mutation and cancers through direct adsorption and enhanced elimination of a dietary mutagen and/or its metabolites, and that wheat bran enriched in pericarp or aleurone cell walls may exert protective effects through different mechanisms.",

To explore whether genetic variations in the promoter region of the PP2A-A\u03b1 gene (PPP2R1A) and their frequent haplotypes in the Han Chinese population have an impact on transcriptional activity, we collected DNA samples from 63 healthy Chinese donors and searched for genetic variations in the 5\u2032-flanking promoter region of PPP2R1A (PPP2R1Ap). Haplotypes were characterized by Haploview analysis and individual subcloning. A set of molecular and functional experiments was performed using reporter genes and electrophoretic mobility shifting assay (EMSA). Seven genetic variations were identified within the promoter locus (2038\u00a0bp) of PPP2R1A. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns and haplotype profiles were analyzed using the identified genetic variants. Using serially truncated human PPP2R1A promoter luciferase constructs, we found that a 685\u00a0bp (\u2212448\u00a0nt to +237\u00a0nt) fragment around the transcription start site (TSS) was the core promoter region. Individual subcloning revealed the existence of six haplotypes in this proximal promoter region of PPP2R1Ap. Using luciferase reporter assays, we found that different haplotypes bearing different variant alleles exhibit distinct promoter activities. The EMSA revealed that the \u2212241 \u2212/G variant influences DNA\u2013protein interactions involving the transcription factor NF-\u03baB, which may regulate the activity of the PPP2R1A proximal promoter. Our findings suggest that functional genetic variants in the proximal promoter of the PP2A-A\u03b1 gene and their haplotypes are critical in the regulation of transcriptional activation.",

Previously we had shown that the increased chromosome aberrations in ATM and NBS defective lines was due to a significantly larger quadratic dose\u2013response term compared to normal fibroblasts for both simple and complex exchanges. The linear dose\u2013response term for simple exchanges was significantly higher in NBS cells compared to wild type cells, but not for AT cells. However, AT cells have a high background level of exchanges compared to wild type or NBS cells that confounds the understanding of low dose responses. To understand the sensitivity differences for high to low doses, chromosomal aberration analysis was first performed at low dose-rates (0.5\u00a0Gy/d), and results provided further evidence for the lack of sensitivity for exchanges in AT cells below doses of 1\u00a0Gy. Normal lung fibroblast cells treated with KU-55933, a specific ATM kinase inhibitor, showed increased numbers of exchanges at a dose of 1\u00a0Gy and higher, but were similar to wild type cells at 0.5\u00a0Gy or below. These results were confirmed using siRNA knockdown of ATM. The present study provides evidence that the increased radiation sensitivity of AT cells for chromosomal exchanges found at high dose does not occur at low dose.",

     "abstract": "1,3-Butadiene (BD) is an air pollutant and a known carcinogen. 1,2,3,4-Diepoxybutane (DEB), one of the major in vivo metabolites of BD, is considered the ultimate culprit of BD mutagenicity/carcinogenicity. DEB is a bifunctional alkylating agent, being capable of inducing the formation of monoalkylated DNA adducts and DNA cross-links, including DNA\u2013DNA and DNA\u2013protein cross-links (DPC). In the present study, we investigated DEB-caused DNA cross-links and breaks in human hepatocyte L02 cells using comet assay. With alkaline comet assay, it was observed that DNA migration increased with the increase of DEB concentration at lower concentrations (10\u2013200\u00a0\u03bcM); however, at higher concentrations (200\u20131000\u00a0\u03bcM), DNA migration decreased with the increase of DEB concentration. This result indicated the presence of cross-links at >\u00a0200\u00a0\u03bcM, which was confirmed by the co-treatment experiments using the second genotoxic agents, tert-butyl hydroperoxide and methyl methanesulfonate. At 200\u00a0\u03bcM, which appeared as a threshold, the DNA migration-retarding effect of cross-links was just observable by the co-treatment experiments. At <\u00a0200\u00a0\u03bcM, the effect of cross-links was too weak to be detected. The DEB-induced cross-links were determined to be DNA\u2013DNA ones rather than DPC through incubating the librated DNA with proteinase K prior to unwinding and electrophoresis. However, at the highest DEB concentration tested (1000\u00a0\u03bcM), a small proportion of DPC could be formed. In addition, the experiments using neutral and weakly alkaline comet assays showed that DEB did not cause double-strand breaks, but did induce single-strand breaks (SSB) and alkali-labile sites (ALS). Since SSB and ALS are repaired more rapidly than cross-links, the results suggested that DNA\u2013DNA cross-links, rather than DPC, were probably responsible for mutagenicity/carcinogenicity of DEB.",

     "abstract": "Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer in lifelong nonsmokers. However, the underlying mechanism of action of SHS in lung carcinogenesis remains elusive. We have investigated, using the 32P-postlabeling assay, the genotoxic potential of SHS in vivo by determining the formation and kinetics of repair of DNA adducts in the lungs of mice exposed whole body to SHS for 2 or 4 months (5\u00a0h/day, 5 days/week), and an ensuing one-month recovery period. We demonstrate that exposure of mice to SHS elicits a significant genotoxic response as reflected by the elevation of DNA adduct levels in the lungs of SHS-exposed animals. The increases in DNA adduct levels in the lungs of SHS-exposed mice are dose-dependent as they are related to the intensity and duration of SHS exposure. After one month of recovery in clean air, the levels of lung DNA adducts in the mice exposed for 4 months remain significantly higher than those in the mice exposed for 2 months (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0005), levels in both groups being significantly elevated relative to controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.00001). Our experimental findings accord with the epidemiological data showing that exposure to smoke-derived carcinogens is a risk factor for lung cancer; not only does the magnitude of risk depend upon carcinogen dose, but it also becomes more irreversible with prolonged exposure. The confirmation of epidemiologic data by our experimental findings is of significance because it strengthens the case for the etiologic involvement of SHS in nonsmokers\u2019 lung cancer. Identifying the etiologic factors involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer can help define future strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment of this highly lethal malignancy.",

Cultured mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), a model for early embryonic cells, differ from cultured somatic cells in their capacity to remodel chromatin, in their repertoire of DNA repair enzymes, and in the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints. Using 129XC3HF1 mESCs heterozygous for Aprt, we characterized loss of Aprt heterozygosity after exposure to ionizing radiation. We report here that the frequency of loss of heterozygosity mutants in mESCs can be induced several hundred-fold by exposure to 5\u201310\u00a0Gy of X-rays. This induction is 50\u2013100-fold higher than the induction reported for mouse adult or embryonic fibroblasts. The primary mechanism underlying the elevated loss of heterozygosity after irradiation is mitotic recombination, with lesser contributions from deletions and gene conversions that span Aprt. Aprt point mutations and epigenetic inactivation are very rare in mESCs compared to fibroblasts. Mouse ESCs, therefore, are distinctive in their response to ionizing radiation and studies of differentiated cells may underestimate the mutagenic effects of ionizing radiation on ESC or other stem cells. Our findings are important to understanding the biological effects of ionizing radiation on early development and carcinogenesis.",

The present work assessed the action of the oligoelement selenium on cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, and in situ apoptosis induction and on the expression CASP9, BCL-XL and APC genes in intestinal adenocarcinoma cells (HT29). HT29 cells were cultured and treated with selenium at concentrations of 5, 50 and 500\u00a0ng/mL with or without the damage-inducing agent doxorubicin. These cells were then evaluated for cytotoxicity (MTT), cell proliferation and in situ apoptosis induction. To evaluate gene expression, only the cells treated with 500\u00a0ng/mL of selenium were used. RNA was extracted from these cells, and the expressions of CASP9, BCL-XL and APC were analyzed by the RT-PCR method. The GAPDH gene was used as a reference gene. The MTT assay showed that selenium was not cytotoxic at any of the concentrations tested. The cell proliferation assay showed that selenium did not interfere with cell proliferation at the three concentrations tested. In contrast, when the three concentrations were combined with doxorubicin, a significant decrease in the proliferation rate was observed. The apoptosis rate was significantly increased in the selenium (500\u00a0ng/mL) and doxorubicin group. CASP9 expression was increased and BCL-XL expression decreased in the selenium (500\u00a0ng/mL) and doxorubicin group. APC was significantly increased in the selenium group alone. These results show that selenium increases apoptosis, especially when it is associated with a damage-inducing agent. Also, selenium has an important role in the expression of the APC gene, which is related to cell cycle regulation.",

UVA-induced mutations were significantly higher while the survival was slightly lower in transfected compared to non-transfected cells. The increased mutation rate in transfected cells at increased exposure correlated with enhanced levels of 8-oxodG in the nucleotide pool, and a somewhat reduced level of 8-oxodG in the medium.

In addition, 3 non-genotoxic cytotoxins (phthalic anhydride, n-butyl chloride and hexachloroethane) were included to investigate the influence of cytotoxicity on assay performance. At similar cytotoxicity levels (relative cell counts; RCC 75-40%) all prototypical genotoxins induced marked concentration-dependent increases in \u03b3H2AX compared with the non-genotoxins.

     "abstract": "Inorganic arsenic is a strong, widespread human carcinogen. How exactly inorganic arsenic exerts carcinogenicity in humans is as yet unclear, but it is thought to be closely related to its metabolism. At exposure-relevant concentrations arsenic is neither directly DNA reactive nor mutagenic. Thus, more likely epigenetic and indirect genotoxic effects, among others a modulation of the cellular DNA damage response and DNA repair, are important molecular mechanisms contributing to its carcinogenicity. In the present study, we investigated the impact of arsenic on several base excision repair (BER) key players in cultured human lung cells. For the first time gene expression, protein level and in case of human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (hOGG1) protein function was examined in one study, comparing inorganic arsenite and its trivalent and pentavalent mono- and dimethylated metabolites, also taking into account their cellular bioavailability. Our data clearly show that arsenite and its metabolites can affect several cellular endpoints related to DNA repair. Thus, cellular OGG activity was most sensitively affected by dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV), DNA ligase III\u03b1 (LIGIII\u03b1) protein level by arsenite and X-ray cross complementing protein 1 (XRCC1 protein) content by monomethylarsonic acid (MMAV), with significant effects starting at \u22653.2\u00a0\u03bcM cellular arsenic. With respect to MMAV, to our knowledge these effects are the most sensitive endpoints, related to DNA damage response, that have been identified so far. In contrast to earlier nucleotide excision repair related studies, the trivalent methylated metabolites exerted strong effects on the investigated BER key players only at cytotoxic concentrations. In summary, our data point out that after mixed arsenic species exposure, a realistic scenario after oral inorganic arsenic intake in humans, DNA repair might be affected by different mechanisms and therefore very effectively, which might facilitate the carcinogenic process of inorganic arsenic.",

Hep G2 cells are resistant to etoposide when compared with Chang Liver cells. Etoposide-induced \u03b3H2AX foci in Hep G2 cells are persisted for a longer time without affecting cell cycle, indicating that Hep G2 cells are able to maintain its growth with damaged DNA. Further, Akt signaling pathway is deregulated in Hep G2 cells. The upstream negative regulator of Akt, PTEN remains inactive, as it is hyperphosphorylated in Hep G2 cells. Inhibition of PI-3K pathway by wortmannin partially reverses the etoposide-resistance character of Hep G2 cells. Either Hep G2 or Chang Liver cells when transfected with plasmid carrying active Akt (myr-Akt) become resistance towards etoposide compared to the cells transfected with empty vectors or kinase defective Akt. Transient transfection of wild type PTEN in Hep G2 cells does not change its response towards etoposide whereas Chang Liver cells become sensitive after transfection with same plasmid.

     "abstract": "Short synthetic single-stranded oligodeoxyribonucleotides (ssODNs) can be used to introduce subtle modifications into the genome of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We have previously shown that effective application of ssODN-mediated gene targeting in ESC requires (transient) suppression of DNA mismatch repair (MMR). However, whereas transient down-regulation of the mismatch recognition protein MSH2 allowed substitution of 3 or 4 nucleotides, 1 or 2 nucleotide substitutions were still suppressed. We now demonstrate that single- or dinucleotide substitution can effectively be achieved by transient down-regulation of the downstream MMR protein MLH1. By exploiting highly specific real-time PCR, we demonstrate the feasibility of substituting a single basepair in a non-selectable gene. However, disabling the MMR machinery may lead to inadvertent mutations. To obtain insight into the mutation rate associated with transient MMR suppression, we have compared the impact of transient and constitutive MMR deficiency on the repair of frameshift intermediates at mono- and dinucleotide repeats. Repair at these repeats relied on the substrate specificity and functional redundancy of the MSH2/MSH6 and MSH2/MSH3 MMR complexes. MLH1 knockdown increased the level of spontaneous mutagenesis, but modified ESCs remained germ line competent. Thus, transient MLH1 suppression provides a valuable extension of the MSH2 knockdown strategy, allowing rapid generation of mice carrying single basepair alterations in their genome.",

Supplementation of drinking water with GA (12.8\u00a0mg/person/d) for three days led to a significant reduction of DNA migration attributable to oxidised pyrimidines (endonuclease III sensitive sites) and oxidised purines (formamidopyrimidine glycosylase sensitive sites) in lymphocytes of healthy individuals by 75% and 64% respectively. Also DNA damage caused by treatment of the cells with reactive oxygen species (ROS) was reduced after GA consumption (by 41%). These effects were paralleled by an increase of the activities of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathion-S-transferase-\u03c0) and a decrease of intracellular ROS concentrations in lymphocytes, while no alterations of the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), of malondialdehyde levels in serum and of the urinary excretion of isoprostanes were found. Experiments with rats showed that GA reduces oxidatively damaged DNA in lymphocytes, liver, colon and lungs and protects these organs against \u03b3-irradiation-induced strand breaks and formation of oxidatively damaged DNA-bases. Furthermore, the number of radiation-induced preneoplastic hepatic foci was decreased by 43% after oral administration of the phenolic. Since we did not find alterations of the TAC in plasma and lipid peroxidation of cell membranes but intracellular effects it is likely that the antioxidant properties of GA seen in vivo are not due to direct scavenging of radicals but rather to indirect mechanisms (e.g. protection against ROS via activation of transcription factors). As the amount of GA used in the intervention trial is similar to the daily intake in Middle Europe (18\u00a0mg/person/day), our findings indicate that it may contribute to prevention of formation of oxidatively damaged DNA in humans.",

It was found that idarubicin and doxorubicin treatment (12\u00a0mg/kg) induced sperm meiotic delay of 24\u00a0h. To determine the frequencies of disomic and diploid sperm, groups of 5 male Swiss albino mice were treated with 3, 6 and 12\u00a0mg/kg idarubicin or doxorubicin. Significant increases in the frequencies of disomic and diploid sperm were caused by treatment with all doses of idarubicin and the two highest doses of doxorubicin compared with the controls. Moreover, both compounds significantly increased the frequency of diploid sperm, indicating that complete meiotic arrest occurred. The observation that XX- and YY-sperm significantly prevailed XY-sperm indicates missegregation during the second meiotic division. The results suggest also that earlier prophase stages contribute relatively less to idarubicin and doxorubicin-induced aneuploidy. Effects of the same doses were investigated by the bone-marrow micronucleus test. Significant increases in the frequencies of micronuclei were found after treatment with all doses of both compounds. The responses were also directly correlated with bone marrow suppression. Idarubicin was more toxic than doxorubicin. Exposure to 12\u00a0mg/kg of idarubicin and doxorubicin yielded 3.82 and 2.64% micronuclei, respectively, and of these an average of 58.3 and 62.8%, respectively, showed centromeric signals, indicating their formation by whole chromosomes and reflecting the aneugenic activity of both compounds. Correspondingly, about 41.7 and 37.2% of the induced micronuclei, respectively, were centromere-negative, demonstrating that both compounds not only induce chromosome loss but also DNA strand breaks. Based on our data, aneuploidy assays such as sperm-fluorescence in situ hybridization assay and micronucleus test complemented by fluorescence in situ hybridization with centromeric DNA probes have been to some extent validated to be recommended for the assessment of aneuploidogenic effects of chemicals.",

Although some studies show that these PAHs produce unstable DNA adducts, conflicting data and arguments have been presented regarding the relative roles of these unstable adducts versus stable adducts, as well as oxidative damage, in the mutagenesis and tumor-mutation spectra of these PAHs. However, no study has determined the mutation spectra along with the stable and unstable DNA adducts in the same system with both PAHs. Thus, we determined the mutagenic potencies and mutation spectra of BP and DBP in strains TA98, TA100 and TA104 of Salmonella, and we also measured the levels of abasic sites (aldehydic-site assay) and characterized the stable DNA adducts (32P-postlabeling/HPLC) induced by these PAHs in TA104. Our results for the mutation spectra and site specificity of stable adducts were consistent with those from other systems, showing that DBP was more mutagenic than BP in TA98 and TA100. The mutation spectra of DBP and BP were significantly different in TA98 and TA104, with 24% of the mutations induced by BP in TA98 being complex frameshifts, whereas DBP produced hardly any of these mutations. In TA104, BP produced primarily GC to TA transversions, whereas DBP produced primarily AT to TA transversions. The majority (96%) of stable adducts induced by BP were at guanine, whereas the majority (80%) induced by DBP were at adenine. Although BP induced abasic sites, DBP did not. Most importantly, the proportion of mutations induced by DBP at adenine and guanine paralleled the proportion of stable DNA adducts induced by DBP at adenine and guanine; however, this was not the case for BP. Our results leave open a possible role for unstable DNA adducts in the mutational specificity of BP but not for DBP.",

     "abstract": "Since mutation rate is a key biological parameter, its proper estimation has received great attention for decades. However, instead of the mutation rate, many authors opt for reporting the average mutant frequency, a less meaningful quantity. This is because the standard methods to estimate the mutation rate, derived from the Luria and Delbr\u00fcck's fluctuation analysis, ideally require high-replication experiments to be applied; a requirement often unattainable due to constraints of time, budget or sample availability. But the main problem with mutant frequency, apart from being less informative, is its poor reproducibility; an especially marked defect when the chosen average is the arithmetic mean. Several authors tried to avoid this by employing other averages (such as the median or the geometric mean) or discarding outliers, though as far as we know nobody has evaluated which method performs best under low-replication settings. Here we use computer simulations to compare the performance of different methods used in low-replication experiments (\u22644 cultures). Besides the customary averages of mutant frequency, we also tested two well-known fluctuation methods. Contrary to common practice, our results support that fluctuation methods should be applied in such circumstances, as they perform as well as or better than any average of mutant frequency. In particular, experimentalists will benefit from using MSS maximum likelihood in low-replication experiments because it: (i) provides more reproducible results, (ii) allows for direct estimation of mutation rate and (iii) allows for the application of conventional statistics.",

Although these genes appear to functionally overlap in yeast and other model systems, the specific pathways controlled by SGS1 and MUS81 are poorly defined. Epistasis analyses based on DNA damage sensitivity previously indicated that SGS1 functioned primarily downstream of RAD51, and that MUS81 was independent of RAD51. To further define these genetic pathways, we carried out a systematic epistasis analysis between the RAD52-epistasis group genes and SGS1, MUS81, and RNH202, which encodes a subunit of RNase H2. Based on synthetic-fitness interactions and DNA damage sensitivities, we find that RAD52 is epistatic to MUS81 but not SGS1. In contrast, RAD54, RAD55 and RAD57 are epistatic to SGS1, MUS81 and RNH202. As expected, SHU2 is epistatic to SGS1, while both SHU1 and SHU2 are epistatic to MUS81. Importantly, loss of any RNase H2 subunit on its own resulted in increased recombination using a simple marker-excision assay. RNase H2 is thus needed to maintain genome stability consistent with the sgs1\u0394 rnh202\u0394 synthetic fitness defect. We conclude that SGS1 and MUS81 act in parallel pathways downstream of RAD51 and RAD52, respectively. The data further indicate these pathways share common components and display complex interactions.",

We have investigated the repair of irradiation induced double strand DNA breaks in vivo by \u03b3H2AX foci and first cleavage metaphase analysis. Breaks were induced in sperm and in the early zygote stages comprising sperm chromatin remodelling and early pronucleus expansion. Moreover, the role of PARP1 in the formation and repair of spontaneous and radiation-induced double strand breaks in the zygote was evaluated by comparing observations in C57BL/6J and PARP1 genetically ablated females. The results confirmed in vivo that the rate of chromosome aberration induction by X-rays was approximately 3-fold higher in the zygote than in mouse lymphocytes. This finding was related to a diminished efficiency of double strand break signalling, as shown by a lower rate of \u03b3H2AX radiation-induced foci compared to that measured in most other somatic cell types. The spontaneous frequency of CA in PARP1 depleted zygotes was slightly but significantly higher than in wild type zygotes. Also, these zygotes showed some impairment of the radiation-induced DNA Damage Response when exposed closer to the start of S-phase, revealed by a higher number of \u03b3H2AX foci and a longer cell cycle delay. The rate of chromosome aberrations, however, was not elevated over that of wild type zygotes, possibly thanks to backup repair pathways and/or selection mechanisms against damaged cells. When comparing with the literature data on irradiation induced CA in mouse zygotes in vitro, the levels of induction were strikingly similar as was the frequency of misrepair of double strand breaks (\u03b3H2AX foci). This result can be reassuring for in vitro human gamete and embryo handling, because it shows that culture conditions do not significantly affect double strand DNA break repair.",

     "abstract": "Many of the toxic and carcinogenic effects of urban air pollution have been linked to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) adsorbed to airborne particulate matter (PM). The carcinogenic properties of PAHs in complex organic mixtures derived from PM have been chiefly attributed to their mutagenicity. Nevertheless, PAHs are also potent activators of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which may contribute to their nongenotoxic effects, including tumor promotion. As the genotoxicity of carcinogenic PAHs in complex mixtures derived from urban PM is often inhibited by other mixture constituents, the AhR-mediated activity of urban PM extracts might significantly contribute to the carcinogenic activity of such mixtures. In the present study, we used an organic extract of the urban dust standard reference material, SRM1649a, as a model mixture to study a range of toxic effects related to DNA damage and AhR activation. Both the organic extract and its neutral aromatic fraction formed a low number of DNA adducts per nucleotide in the liver epithelial WB-F344 cells model, without inducing DNA damage response, such as tumor suppressor p53 activation and apoptosis. In contrast, we found that this extract, as well as its neutral and polar fractions, were potent inducers of a range of AhR-mediated responses, including induction of the AhR-mediated transcription, such as cytochrome P450 1A1/1B1 expression, and the AhR-dependent cell proliferation. Importantly, these toxic events occurred at doses one order of magnitude lower than DNA damage. The AhR-mediated activity of the neutral fraction was linked to PAHs and their derivatives, as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, dibenzofurans and biphenyls were only minor contributors to the overall AhR-mediated activity. Taken together, our data suggest that more attention should be paid to the AhR-dependent nongenotoxic events elicited by urban PM constituents, especially PAHs and their derivatives.",

Our results revealed that P. putida Pol I-deficient cells have severe growth defects in LB medium, which is accompanied by filamentous cell morphology. However, growth of Pol I-deficient bacteria on solid rich medium can be restored by reduction of reactive oxygen species in cells. Also, mutants with improved growth emerge rapidly. Similarly to the initial Pol I-deficient P. putida, its adapted derivatives express a moderate mutator phenotype, which indicates that DNA replication carried out in the absence of Pol I is erroneous both in the original Pol I-deficient bacteria and the adapted derivatives. Analysis of the spectra of spontaneous Rifr mutations in P. putida strains lacking different DNA polymerases revealed that the presence of specialized DNA polymerases Pol II and Pol IV influences the frequency of certain base substitutions in Pol I-proficient and Pol I-deficient backgrounds in opposite ways. Involvement of another specialized DNA polymerase DnaE2 in DNA replication in Pol I-deficient bacteria is stimulated by UV irradiation of bacteria, implying that DnaE2-provided translesion synthesis partially substitutes the absence of Pol I in cells containing heavily damaged DNA.",

In nucleotide excision repair-deficient XP-A cells, similar levels of adducts were found in all fragments examined, indicating uniform distribution of DNA damage. In both, repair-proficient CS-B and XP-C cells, faster repair was observed in regions inside the transcribed N-ras and p53 genes, compared to regions on both sides outside of the genes, while no such difference was observed for the inactive d-globin gene. Moreover, very fast adduct repair on the transcribed strand of the active genes was seen immediately downstream of the transcription start site, together with a steeply decreasing gradient of repair efficiency along the gene towards the 3\u2032-end. In all cells analyzed, the above variation in DNA repair efficiency was paralleled exactly by the variation in the degree of local chromatin condensation, more relaxed chromatin being associated with faster repair. Similar results were obtained using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers, suggesting that the existence of a repair gradient along transcribed genes may be a universal phenomenon.

However, recent studies are increasingly pointing a complementary role of epigenetic effects in these processes. While a substantial part of the literature focuses on DNA methylation, there is increasing recognition of the role of non-coding RNAs, including small-, micro-, and pi-RNAs, as well as transposable elements. These play key roles in carcinogenesis, and in germ cell changes including trans-generational effects.",

     "abstract": "Integrity of the germline genome is essential for the production of viable gametes and successful reproduction. In mammals, the generation of gametes involves extensive epigenetic changes (DNA methylation and histone modification) in conjunction with changes in chromosome structure to ensure flawless progression through meiotic recombination and packaging of the genome into mature gametes. Although epigenetic reprogramming is essential for mammalian reproduction, reprogramming also provides a permissive window for exploitation by transposable elements (TEs), autonomously replicating endogenous elements. Expression and propagation of TEs during the reprogramming period can result in insertional mutagenesis that compromises genome integrity leading to reproductive problems and sporadic inherited diseases in offspring. Recent work has identified the germ cell associated PIWI Interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway in conjunction with the DNA methylation and histone modification machinery in silencing TEs. In this review we will highlight these recent advances in piRNA mediated regulation of TEs in the mouse germline, as well as mention the repercussions of failure to properly regulate TEs.",

These environmental exposures include those that have frequently been associated with chronic diseases, such as heavy metals, air pollution, bisphenol A, and cigarette smoking. In this article, we review the published data on miRNAs in relation to the exposure to several environmental chemicals, and discuss the potential mechanisms that may link environmental chemicals to miRNA alterations. We further discuss the challenges in environmental-miRNA research and possible future directions. The accumulating evidence linking miRNAs to environmental chemicals, coupled with the unique regulatory role of miRNAs in gene expression, makes miRNAs potential biomarkers for better understanding the mechanisms of environmental diseases.",

IR-induced genome instability has been well-documented in directly exposed cells and organisms. It has also been observed in distant \u2018bystander\u2019 cells. Enigmatically, increased instability is even observed in progeny of pre-conceptually exposed animals, including humans. The mechanisms by which it arises remain obscure and, recently, they have been proposed to be epigenetic in nature. Three major epigenetic phenomena include DNA methylation, histone modifications and small RNA-mediated silencing. This review focuses on the role of DNA methylation and small RNAs in directly exposed and bystander tissues and in IR-induced transgenerational effects.

Limited attention has been given to the natural variation in miRNA expression across genetically diverse populations even though it is well established that genetic polymorphisms can have a profound effect on mRNA levels. Expression level of 577 miRNAs in the livers of 70 strains of inbred mice was assessed, and we found that miRNA expression is highly stable across different strains. Globally, the expression of miRNA target transcripts does not correlate with miRNA expression, primarily due to the low variance of miRNA but high variance of mRNA expression across strains. Our results show that there is little genetic effect on the baseline miRNA levels in murine liver. The stability of mouse liver miRNA expression in a genetically diverse population suggests that treatment-induced disruptions in liver miRNA expression, a phenomenon established for a large number of toxicants, may indicate an important mechanism for the disturbance of normal liver function, and may prove to be a useful genetic background-independent biomarker of toxicant effect.",

A Chinese case\u2013control study included 339 lung cancer cases and 358 controls using five haplotype-tagging SNPs (htSNPs) (rs3212980, rs3212964, rs3212961, rs11615 and rs2298881) from the HapMap database, capturing 95% of the common haplotypic diversity of ERCC1. A combined analysis of eleven htSNPs covering ERCC2 and ERCC1 was performed. No significant association between individual htSNPs and lung cancer susceptibility was observed. There were interactions between rs3212961 and rs2298881and smoking duration (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.01, respectively). Thus, the variant alleles of rs3212961 [OR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.81(1.03\u20133.17), P\u00a0=\u00a00.04] and rs2298881 [OR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.16(1.26\u20133.70), P\u00a0=\u00a00.005] were associated with risk of lung cancer among long-term smokers (>20 years) but not among never smokers and short-term smokers. No significant associations with lung cancer susceptibility were observed for global or individual haplotypes defined by five htSNPs of ERCC1. A highly differential distribution of haplotypes based on eleven htSNPs covering ERCC2 and ERCC1 were found (global test P\u00a0=4.3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125).

The diplotype analysis with haplotypeER2\u00a0+\u00a01\u20138 was also statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Haplotype analysis of pathological subtypes revealed that htSNPs of both genes may mainly influence the risk of lung adenocarcinoma. Strong linkage disequilibrium exist in two regions encompassing ERCC2 and ERCC1. These data suggest that common genetic variations in ERCC1 may influence increased risk of smoking-related lung cancer and one of the causative effectors may locate around or within ERCC2.",

     "abstract": "To maintain the integrity of the organism, embryonic stem cells (ESC) need to maintain their genomic integrity in response to DNA damage. DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most lethal forms of DNA damage and can have disastrous consequences if not repaired correctly, leading to cell death, genomic instability and cancer. How human ESC (hESC) maintain genomic integrity in response to agents that cause DSBs is relatively unclear. Adult somatic cells can be induced to \u201cdedifferentiate\u201d into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and reprogram into cells of all three germ layers. Whether iPSC have reprogrammed the DNA damage response is a critical question in regenerative medicine. Here, we show that hESC demonstrate high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can contribute to DNA damage and may arise from high levels of metabolic activity. To potentially counter genomic instability caused by DNA damage, we find that hESC employ two strategies: First, these cells have enhanced levels of DNA repair proteins, including those involved in repair of DSBs, and they demonstrate elevated nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) activity and repair efficacy, one of the main pathways for repairing DSBs. Second, they are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents, as evidenced by a high level of apoptosis upon irradiation. Importantly, iPSC, unlike the parent cells they are derived from, mimic hESC in their ROS levels, cell cycle profiles, repair protein expression and NHEJ repair efficacy, indicating reprogramming of the DNA repair pathways. Human iPSC however show a partial apoptotic response to irradiation, compared to hESC. We suggest that DNA damage responses may constitute important markers for the efficacy of iPSC reprogramming.",

     "abstract": "Airborne particulate matter (PM) is considered to be an important contributor to lung diseases. In the present study we report that Milan winter-PM2.5 inhibited proliferation in human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) by inducing mitotic arrest. The cell cycle arrest was followed by an increase in mitotic-apoptotic cells, mitotic slippage and finally an increase in \u201cclassical\u201d apoptotic cells. Exposure to winter-PM10 induced only a slight effect which may be due to the presence of PM2.5 in this fraction while pure combustion particles failed to disturb mitosis. Fewer cells expressing the mitosis marker phospho-histone H3 compared to cells with condensed chromosomes, suggest that PM2.5 induced premature mitosis. PM2.5 was internalized into the cells and often localized in laminar organelles, although particles without apparent plasma membrane covering were also seen. In PM-containing cells mitochondria and lysosomes were often damaged, and in mitotic cells fragmented chromosomes often appeared. PM2.5 induced DNA strands breaks and triggered a DNA-damage response characterized by increased phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2 and H2AX; as well as induced a marked increase in expression of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)-regulated genes, CYP1A1, CYP1B1 and AhRR. Furthermore, some disturbance of the organization of microtubules was indicated. It is hypothesized that the induced mitotic arrest and following cell death was due to a premature chromosome condensation caused by a combination of DNA, mitochondrial and spindle damage.",

Following 48\u00a0h of medium transfer, viability, induction of apoptosis, telomere shortening, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and micronuclei (after stimulation) were analyzed. A statistically significant decrement in cell viability, concomitant with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, telomere shortening, increases in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide anion (O2\u2212) with depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) level, and higher frequencies of micronuclei, were observed in bystander lymphocytes incubated with medium from 0.5 and 3\u00a0Gy irradiated samples, compared to lymphocytes unexposed. Furthermore, no statistically significant difference between the response to 0.5 and 3\u00a0Gy of irradiation in bystander lymphocytes, was found. However, when lymphocytes were irradiated with 0.1\u00a0Gy, no bystander effect with regard to viability, apoptosis, telomere length, and micronuclei was observed, although a high production of ROS level persisted. Radiation in the presence of the radical scavenger dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) suppressed oxidative stress induced by 3\u00a0Gy of X-rays with the effective elimination of bystander effects, suggesting a correlation between ROS and bystander signal formation in irradiated cells. The data propose that bystander effect might be mostly due to the reactions of radiation induced free radicals on DNA, with the existence of a threshold at which the bystander signal is not operative (0.1\u00a0Gy dose of X-rays). Our results may have clinical implications for health risk associated with radiation exposure.",

DNA damages were detected in genomic DNA by Fpg treatment. IgG and IgA were measured from plasma and the cytokines and chemokines were measured from cerebrospinal fluid samples using Bio-Plex assays. A higher frequency (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of APE1 Glu allele in bacterial meningitis (BM) and aseptic meningitis (AM) patients was observed. The genotypes Asn/Asn in control group and Asn/Glu in BM group was also higher. For the SNP OGG1 Ser326Cys, the genotype Cys/Cys was more frequent (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in BM group. The frequency of PARP-1 Val/Val genotype was higher in control group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The occurrence of combined SNPs is significantly higher in BM patients, indicating that these SNPs may be associated to the disease.

     "abstract": "Inorganic arsenic (i-As) is a human carcinogen causing skin, lung, urinary bladder, liver and kidney tumors. Chronic exposure to this naturally occurring contaminant, mainly via drinking water, is a significant worldwide environmental health concern. To explore the molecular mechanisms of arsenic hepatic injury, a differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) screening was undertaken to identify genes with distinct expression patterns between the liver of low i-As-exposed and control animals. Golden Syrian hamsters (5\u20136\u00a0weeks of age) received drinking water containing 15\u00a0mg i-As/L as sodium arsenite, or unaltered water for 18\u00a0weeks. The in vivo MN test was carried out, and the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes (MN-RETs) was scored as a measure of exposure and As-related genotoxic/carcinogenic risk. A total of 68 differentially expressed bands were identified in our initial screen, 41 of which could be assigned to specific genes. Differential level of expression of a selected number of genes was verified using real-time RT-PCR with gene-specific primers. Arsenic-altered gene expression included genes related to stress response, cellular metabolism, cell cycle regulation, telomere maintenance, cell\u2013cell communication and signal transduction. Significant differences of MN-RET were found between treated (8.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02\u00a0MN/1000\u00a0RETs) and control (2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.70\u00a0MN/1000\u00a0RETs) groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), demonstrating both the exposure and the i-As genotoxic/carcinogenic risk. Overall, this paper reveals some possible networks involved in hepatic arsenic-related genotoxicity, carcinogenesis and diabetogenesis. Additional studies to explore further the potential implications of each candidate gene are of especial interest. The present work opens the door to new prospects for the study of i-As mechanisms taking place in the liver under chronic settings.",

To explore combined genotoxic effects of radiation and chemicals, we examined modulating effects of N-methyl-N\u2032-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), a direct-acting methylating agent, against genotoxicity of \u03b3-radiation. Human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells and its mismatch-deficient derivative, i.e., MT1 cells, were treated with MNNG for 24\u00a0h before they were exposed to \u03b3-irradiation at a dose of 1.0\u00a0Gy, and the resulting genotoxicity was examined. In TK6 cells, the pretreatments with MNNG at low doses suppressed frequencies of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene mutation and micronucleus (MN) formation induced by \u03b3-irradiation and thus the dose responses of TK and MN assays were U-shaped along with the pretreatment doses of MNNG. In contrast, the genotoxic effects of MNNG and \u03b3-irradiation were additive in MT1 cells and the frequencies of TK mutations and MN induction increased along with the doses of MNNG. Apoptosis induced by \u03b3-radiation was suppressed by the pretreatments in TK6 cells, but not in MT1 cells. The expression of p53 was induced and cell cycle was delayed at G2/M phase in TK6, but not in MT1 cells, by the treatments with MNNG. These results suggest that pretreatments of MNNG at low doses suppress genotoxicity of \u03b3-radiation in human cells and also that mismatch repair proteins are involved in the apparent adaptive responses.",

Some of these changes are mediated through acetylation/deacetylation of histones. Here, we show that recombinational repair of DNA damage induced by the anti-cancer drug camptothecin (CPT) and the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is blocked by sodium phenylbutyrate (PBA) in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In particular, PBA suppresses CPT- and MMS-induced genetic recombination as well as DNA double-strand break repair during mating-type interconversion. Treatment with PBA is accompanied by a dramatic reduction in histone H4 lysine 8 acetylation. Live cell imaging of homologous recombination proteins indicates that repair of CPT-induced DNA damage is redirected to a non-recombinogenic pathway in the presence of PBA without loss in cell viability. In contrast, the suppression of MMS-induced recombination by PBA is accompanied by a dramatic loss in cell viability. Taken together, our results demonstrate that PBA inhibits DNA damage-induced homologous recombination likely by mediating changes in chromatin acetylation. Moreover, the combination of PBA with genotoxic agents can lead to different cell fates depending on the type of DNA damage inflicted.",

The exposed cells and bystander endotheliocytes showed similar response to low doses: approximation of the 1q12 loci of chromosome 1 and their transposition into the cellular nucleus, change in shape of the endotheliocytic nucleus, activation of the nucleolus organizing regions (NORs), actin polymerization, and an elevated level of DNA double-stranded breaks. Following blockade of TLR9 receptors with oligonucleotide-inhibitor or chloroquine in the bystander cells these effects \u2013 except of activation of NORs \u2013 on exposure to ecDNAR disappeared, with no bystander response thus observed. The presence of the radiation-induced apoptosis in the bystander effect being studied suggests a possibility for radiation-modified ecDNA fragments (i.e., stress signaling factors) to be released into the culture medium, whereas inhibition of TLR9 suggests the binding these ligands to the recipient cells. A similar DNA-signaling pathway in the bystander effect we previously described for human lymphocytes. Integrity of data makes it possible to suppose that a similar signaling mechanism which we demonstrated for lymphocytes (humoral system) might also be mediated in a monolayer culture of cells (cellular tissue) after the development of the bystander effect in them and transfer of stress signaling factors (ecDNAR) through the culture medium.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations, especially deletions, have been suggested to play an important role in aging and degenerative diseases. In particular, the common deletion in humans and rats (4977\u00a0bp and 4834\u00a0bp deletion, respectively) has been shown to accumulate with age in post-mitotic tissues with high energetic demands. Among numerous deletions, the common deletion has been proposed to serve as a molecular marker for aging and play a critical role in presbyacusis. However, so far no previous publication has quantified the contribution of common deletion to the total burden of mtDNA deletions in tissues during aging process. In the present study, we established a rat model with various degrees of aging in inner ear induced by three different doses of d-galactose (d-gal) administration. Firstly, multiple mtDNA deletions in inner ear were detected by nested PCR and long range PCR. In addition to the common deletion, three novel mtDNA deletions were identified. All four deletions, located in the major arc of mtDNA, are flanked by direct repeats and involve the cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit III gene, encoded by mtDNA. Additionally, absolute quantitative real-time PCR assay was used to detect the level of common deletion and total deletion burden of mtDNA. The quantitative data show that the common deletion is the most frequent type of mtDNA deletions, exceeding 67.86% of the total deletion burden. Finally, increased mtDNA copy number, reduced COX activity and mosaic ultrastructural impairments in inner ear were identified in d-gal-induced aging rats. The increase of mtDNA replication may contribute to the accelerated accumulation of mtDNA deletions, which may result in impairment of mitochondrial function in inner ear. Taken together, these findings suggest that the common deletion may serve as an ideal molecular marker to assess the mtDNA damage in inner ear during aging.",

We observed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ten of these, including the G619A SNP in five isolates and an additional four so far un-described mutations in another five isolates. Among the latter SNPs, two were synonymous (C276T, n\u00a0=\u00a01 and C375G, n\u00a0=\u00a03), while two more non-synonymous SNPs were composed of C373A (Leu\u2192Met) and T503G (Met\u2192Arg) were observed in respectively one and two isolates. Molecular modeling and structural analysis based in a constructed full length 3D models of wild type TBNAT (TBNAT_H37Rv) and the isoforms (TBNAT_L125M and TBNAT_M168R) were also performed. The refined models show that, just as observed in human NATs, the carboxyl terminus extends deep within the folded enzyme, into close proximity to the buried catalytic triad. Analysis of tbnat that present non-synonymous mutations indicates that both substitutions are plausible to affect enzyme specificity or acetyl-CoA binding capacity. The results contribute to a better understanding of structure\u2013function relationships of NATs. However, further investigation including INH-sensitive strains as a control group is needed to get better understanding of the possible role of these new mutations on tuberculosis control.",

     "abstract": "Common fragile sites (CFS) are specific chromosomal areas prone to form gaps and breaks when cells are exposed to stresses that affect DNA synthesis, such as exposure to aphidicolin (APC), an inhibitor of DNA polymerases. The APC-induced DNA damage is repaired primarily by homologous recombination (HR), and RAD51, one of the key players in HR, participates to CFS stability. Since another DNA repair pathway, the mismatch repair (MMR), is known to control HR, we examined the influence of both the MMR and HR DNA repair pathways on the extent of chromosomal damage and distribution of CFS provoked by APC and/or by RAD51 silencing in MMR-deficient and -proficient colon cancer cell lines (i.e., HCT-15 and HCT-15 transfected with hMSH6, or HCT-116 and HCT-116/3+6, in which a part of a chromosome 3 containing the wild-type hMLH1 allele was inserted). Here, we show that MMR-deficient cells are more sensitive to APC-induced chromosomal damage particularly at the CFS as compared to MMR-proficient cells, indicating an involvement of MMR in the control of CFS stability. The most expressed CFS is FRA16D in 16q23, an area containing the tumour suppressor gene WWOX often mutated in colon cancer. We also show that silencing of RAD51 provokes a higher number of breaks in MMR-proficient cells with respect to their MMR-deficient counterparts, likely as a consequence of the combined inhibitory effects of RAD51 silencing on HR and MMR-mediated suppression of HR. The RAD51 silencing causes a broader distribution of breaks at CFS than that observed with APC. Treatment with APC of RAD51-silenced cells further increases DNA breaks in MMR-proficient cells. The RNAi-mediated silencing of PARP-1 does not cause chromosomal breaks or affect the expression/distribution of CFS induced by APC. Our results indicate that MMR modulates colon cancer sensitivity to chromosomal breaks and CFS induced by APC and RAD51 silencing.",

Previous work has shown that particulate air pollutants (PAPs) from industrial environments cause DNA damage and mutations in the sperm of adult male mice. Effects on the female and male germline during critical stages of development (in utero) are unknown. In mice, previous studies have shown that expanded simple tandem repeat (ESTR) loci exhibit high rates of spontaneous mutation, making this endpoint a valuable tool for studying inherited mutation and genomic instability. In the present study, pregnant C57Bl/6 mice were exposed to 19\u00a0mg/m3 DEP from gestational day 7 through 19, alongside air exposed controls. Male and female F1 offspring were raised to maturity and mated with control CBA mice. The F2 descendents were collected and ESTR germline mutation rates were derived from full pedigrees (mother, father, offspring) of F1 male and female mice. We found no evidence for increased ESTR mutation rates in females exposed in utero to DEP relative to control females. In contrast, a statistically significant increase in the mutation frequency of male mice exposed in utero to DEP was observed (2-fold; Fisher's exact p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Thus, maternal exposure to DEP results in increased mutation in sperm during development.",

In contrast application of GC\u2013MS and HPLC\u2013MS methods that are subject to major drawbacks have been shown to lead to overestimated values of DNA damage. Enzymatic methods that are based on the use of DNA repair glycosylases in order to convert oxidized bases into strand breaks are suitable, even if they are far less specific than HPLC methods, to deal with low levels of single modifications. Several other methods including immunoassays and 32P-postlabeling methods that are still used suffer from drawbacks and therefore are not recommended.

In occasion of persistent conditions that influence the formation and accumulation of aldehyde-derived DNA adducts the resulting unrepaired DNA damage causes deregulation of cell homeostasis and thus significantly contributes to disease phenotype. Some of the most highly reactive aldehydes produced endogenously are 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, malondialdehyde, acrolein, crotonaldehyde and methylglyoxal. The mutagenic and carcinogenic effects associated with the elevated levels of these reactive aldehydes, especially, under conditions of stress, are attributed to their capability of causing directly modification of DNA bases or yielding promutagenic exocyclic adducts.

A Monte-Carlo based model of simulation of the reaction of OH radicals with the macromolecules, called RADACK, allows calculating the relative probability of damage of each nucleotide of DNA irradiated alone or in complexes with proteins. RADACK calculations require the knowledge of the three dimensional structure of DNA and its complexes (determined by X-ray crystallography, NMR spectroscopy or molecular modeling). The confrontation of the calculated values with the results of the radiolytic footprinting experiments together with molecular modeling calculations show that: (1) the extent and location of the lesions are strongly dependent on the structure of DNA, which in turns is modulated by the base sequence and by the binding of proteins and (2) the regions in contact with the protein can be protected against the attack by the hydroxyl radicals via masking of the binding site and by scavenging of the radicals.",

     "abstract": "A defining characteristic of damage induced in the DNA by ionizing radiation (IR) is its clustered character that leads to the formation of complex lesions challenging the cellular repair mechanisms. The most widely investigated such complex lesion is the DNA double strand break (DSB). DSBs undermine chromatin stability and challenge the repair machinery because an intact template strand is lacking to assist restoration of integrity and sequence in the DNA molecule. Therefore, cells have evolved a sophisticated machinery to detect DSBs and coordinate a response on the basis of inputs from various sources. A central function of cellular responses to DSBs is the coordination of DSB repair. Two conceptually different mechanisms can in principle remove DSBs from the genome of cells of higher eukaryotes. Homologous recombination repair (HRR) uses as template a homologous DNA molecule and is therefore error-free; it functions preferentially in the S and G2 phases. Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), on the other hand, simply restores DNA integrity by joining the two ends, is error prone as sequence is only fortuitously preserved and active throughout the cell cycle. The basis of DSB repair pathway choice remains unknown, but cells of higher eukaryotes appear programmed to utilize preferentially NHEJ. Recent work suggests that when the canonical DNA-PK dependent pathway of NHEJ (D-NHEJ), becomes compromised an alternative NHEJ pathway and not HRR substitutes in a quasi-backup function (B-NHEJ). Here, we outline aspects of DSB induction by IR and review the mechanisms of their processing in cells of higher eukaryotes. We place particular emphasis on backup pathways of NHEJ and summarize their increasing significance in various cellular processes, as well as their potential contribution to carcinogenesis.",

Recent data indicate a large degree of sequence variability in DNA repair genes and several studies have associated BER gene polymorphisms with disease risk, including cancer of several sites. The intent of this review is to describe the range of BER capacity among individuals and the functional consequences of BER genetic variants. We also discuss studies that associate BER deficiency with disease risk and the current state of BER capacity measurement assays.",

     "abstract": "Genomic DNA is associated with various structural, regulatory, and transaction proteins. The dynamic and reversible association between proteins and DNA ensures the accurate expression and propagation of genetic information. However, various endogenous, environmental, and chemotherapeutic agents induce DNA\u2013protein crosslinks (DPCs), and hence covalently trap proteins on DNA. Since DPCs are extremely large compared to conventional DNA lesions, they probably impair many aspects of DNA transactions such as replication, transcription, and repair due to steric hindrance. Recent genetic and biochemical studies have shed light on the elaborate molecular mechanism by which cells repair or tolerate DPCs. This review summarizes the current knowledge regarding the repair and biochemical effects of the most ubiquitous form of DPCs, which are associated with no flanked DNA strand breaks. In bacteria small DPCs are eliminated by nucleotide excision repair (NER), whereas oversized DPCs are processed by RecBCD-dependent homologous recombination (HR). NER does not participate in the repair of DPCs in mammalian cells, since the upper size limit of DPCs amenable to mammalian NER is smaller than that of bacterial NER. Thus, DPCs are processed exclusively by HR. The reactivation of the stalled replication fork at DPCs by HR seems to involve fork breakage in mammalian cells but not in bacterial cells. In addition, recent proteomic studies have identified the numbers of proteins in DPCs induced by environmental and chemotherapeutic agents. However, it remains largely elusive how DPCs affect replication and transcription at the molecular level. Considering the extremely large nature of DPCs, it is possible that they impede the progression of replication and transcription machineries by mechanisms different from those for conventional DNA lesions. This might also be true for the DNA damage response and signaling mechanism.",

     "abstract": "A clustered DNA lesion, also known as a multiply damaged site, is defined as \u22652 damages in the DNA within 1\u20132 helical turns. Only ionizing radiation and certain chemicals introduce DNA damage in the genome in this non-random way. What is now clear is that the lethality of a damaging agent is not just related to the types of DNA lesions introduced, but also to how the damage is distributed in the DNA. Clustered DNA lesions were first hypothesized to exist in the 1990s, and work has progressed where these complex lesions have been characterized and measured in irradiated as well as in non-irradiated cells. A clustered lesion can consist of single as well as double strand breaks, base damage and abasic sites, and the damages can be situated on the same strand or opposing strands. They include tandem lesions, double strand break (DSB) clusters and non-DSB clusters, and base excision repair as well as the DSB repair pathways can be required to remove these complex lesions. Due to the plethora of oxidative damage induced by ionizing radiation, and the repair proteins involved in their removal from the DNA, it has been necessary to study how repair systems handle these lesions using synthetic DNA damage. This review focuses on the repair process and mutagenic consequences of clustered lesions in yeast and mammalian cells. By examining the studies on synthetic clustered lesions, and the effects of low vs high LET radiation on mammalian cells or tissues, it is possible to extrapolate the potential biological relevance of these clustered lesions to the killing of tumor cells by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and to the risk of cancer in non-tumor cells, and this will be discussed.",

     "abstract": "A signature of ionizing radiation exposure is the induction of DNA clustered damaged sites, defined as two or more lesions within one to two helical turns of DNA by passage of a single radiation track. Clustered damage is made up of double strand breaks (DSB) with associated base lesions or abasic (AP) sites, and non-DSB clusters comprised of base lesions, AP sites and single strand breaks. This review will concentrate on the experimental findings of the processing of non-DSB clustered damaged sites. It has been shown that non-DSB clustered damaged sites compromise the base excision repair pathway leading to the lifetime extension of the lesions within the cluster, compared to isolated lesions, thus the likelihood that the lesions persist to replication and induce mutation is increased. In addition certain non-DSB clustered damaged sites are processed within the cell to form additional DSB. The use of E. coli to demonstrate that clustering of DNA lesions is the major cause of the detrimental consequences of ionizing radiation is also discussed. The delayed repair of non-DSB clustered damaged sites in humans can be seen as a \u201cfriend\u201d, leading to cell killing in tumour cells or as a \u201cfoe\u201d, resulting in the formation of mutations and genetic instability in normal tissue.",

     "abstract": "Hibernation is an established strategy used by some homeothermic organisms to survive cold environments. In true hibernation, the core body temperature of an animal may drop to below 0\u00a0\u00b0C and metabolic activity almost cease. The phenomenon of hibernation in humans is receiving renewed interest since several cases of victims exhibiting core body temperatures as low as 13.7\u00a0\u00b0C have been revived with minimal lasting deficits. In addition, local cooling during radiotherapy has resulted in normal tissue protection. The experiments described in this paper were prompted by the results of a very limited pilot study, which showed a suppressed DNA repair response of mouse lymphocytes collected from animals subjected to 7-Gy total body irradiation under hypothermic (13\u00a0\u00b0C) conditions, compared to normothermic controls. Here we report that human BJ-hTERT cells exhibited a pronounced radioprotective effect on clonogenic survival when cooled to 13\u00a0\u00b0C during and 12\u00a0h after irradiation. Mild hypothermia at 20 and 30\u00a0\u00b0C also resulted in some radioprotection. The neutral comet assay revealed an apparent lack on double strand break (DSB) rejoining at 13\u00a0\u00b0C. Extension of the mouse lymphocyte study to ex vivo-irradiated human lymphocytes confirmed lower levels of induced phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3-H2AX) and persistence of the lesions at hypothermia compared to the normal temperature. Parallel studies of radiation-induced oxidatively clustered DNA lesions (OCDLs) revealed partial repair at 13\u00a0\u00b0C compared to the rapid repair at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. For both \u03b3-H2AX foci and OCDLs, the return of lymphocytes to 37\u00a0\u00b0C resulted in the resumption of normal repair kinetics. These results, as well as observations made by others and reviewed in this study, have implications for understanding the radiobiology and protective mechanisms underlying hypothermia and potential opportunities for exploitation in terms of protecting normal tissues against radiation.",

     "abstract": "Both exogenous and endogenous agents are a threat to DNA integrity. Exogenous environmental agents such as ultraviolet (UV) and ionizing radiation, genotoxic chemicals and endogenous byproducts of metabolism including reactive oxygen species can cause alterations in DNA structure (DNA damage). Unrepaired DNA damage has been linked to a variety of human disorders including cancer and neurodegenerative disease. Thus, efficient mechanisms to detect DNA lesions, signal their presence and promote their repair have been evolved in cells. If DNA is effectively repaired, DNA damage response is inactivated and normal cell functioning resumes. In contrast, when DNA lesions cannot be removed, chronic DNA damage triggers specific cell responses such as cell death and senescence. Recently, DNA damage has been shown to induce autophagy, a cellular catabolic process that maintains a balance between synthesis, degradation, and recycling of cellular components. But the exact mechanisms by which DNA damage triggers autophagy are unclear. More importantly, the role of autophagy in the DNA damage response and cellular fate is unknown. In this review we analyze evidence that supports a role for autophagy as an integral part of the DNA damage response.",

     "abstract": "The formation of diverse chromosomal aberrations following irradiation and the variability in radiosensitivity at different cell-cycle stages remain a long standing controversy, probably because most of the studies have focused on elucidating the enzymatic mechanisms involved using simple DNA substrates. Yet, recognition, processing and repair of DNA damage occur within the nucleoprotein complex of chromatin which is dynamic in nature, capable of rapid unfolding, disassembling, assembling and refolding. The present work reviews experimental work designed to investigate the impact of chromatin dynamics and chromosome conformation changes during cell-cycle in the formation of chromosomal aberrations. Using conventional cytogenetics and premature chromosome condensation to visualize interphase chromatin, the data presented support the hypothesis that chromatin dynamic changes during cell-cycle are important determinants in the conversion of sub-microscopic DNA lesions into chromatid breaks. Consequently, the type and yield of radiation-induced chromosomal aberrations at a given cell-cycle-stage depends on the combined effect of DNA repair processes and chromatin dynamics, which is cell-cycle-regulated and subject to up- or down-regulation following radiation exposure or genetic alterations. This new hypothesis is used to explain the variability in radiosensitivity observed at various cell-cycle-stages, among mutant cells and cells of different origin, or among different individuals, and to revisit unresolved issues and unanswered questions. In addition, it is used to better understand hypersensitivity of AT cells and to provide an improved predictive G2-assay for evaluating radiosensitivity at individual level. Finally, experimental data at single cell level obtained using hybrid cells suggest that the proposed hypothesis applies only to the irradiated component of the hybrid.",

High-LET radiation is much more effective than low-LET radiation in causing various biological effects, including cell inactivation, genetic mutations, cataracts and cancer induction. Most of these biological endpoints are closely related to chromosomal damage, and cytogenetic damage can be utilized as a biomarker for radiation insults. Epidemiological data, mainly from survivors of the atomic bomb detonations in Japan, have enabled risk estimation from low-LET radiation exposures. The identification of a cytogenetic signature that distinguishes high- from low-LET exposure remains a long-term goal in radiobiology. Recently developed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-painting methodologies have revealed unique endpoints related to radiation quality. Heavy-ions induce a high fraction of complex-type exchanges, and possibly unique chromosome rearrangements. This review will concentrate on recent data obtained with multicolor banding in situ hybridization (mBAND) methods in mammalian cells exposed to low- and high-LET radiations. Chromosome analysis with mBAND technique allows detection of both inter- and intrachromosomal exchanges, and also distribution of the breakpoints of aberrations.",

     "abstract": "Cells in tissues and organs are continuously subjected to oxidative stress and free radicals on a daily basis. This free radical attack has exogenous or endogenous (intracellular) origin. The cells withstand and counteract this occurrence by the use of several and different defense mechanisms ranging from free radical scavengers like glutathione (GSH), vitamins C and E and antioxidant enzymes like catalase, superoxide dismutase and various peroxidases to sophisticated and elaborate DNA repair mechanisms. The outcome of this dynamic equilibrium is usually the induction of oxidatively induced DNA damage and a variety of lesions of small to high importance and dangerous for the cell i.e. isolated base lesions or single strand breaks (SSBs) to complex lesions like double strand breaks (DSBs) and other non-DSB oxidatively generated clustered DNA lesions (OCDLs). The accumulation of DNA damage through misrepair or incomplete repair may lead to mutagenesis and consequently transformation particularly if combined with a deficient apoptotic pathway. In this review, we present the current status of knowledge and evidence on the mechanisms and involvement of intracellular oxidative stress and DNA damage in human malignancy evolution and possible use of these parameters as cancer biomarkers. At the same time, we discuss controversies related to potential artifacts inherent to specific methodologies used for the measurement of oxidatively induced DNA lesions in human cells or tissues.",

Here, we analyzed what other changes in the genome are triggered by pathogen infection. For the analysis of HRF, mutation frequency (MF) and microsatellite instability (MI), we used three different transgenic Arabidopsis lines carrying \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS)-based substrates in their genome. We found that local infection of Arabidopsis with ORMV resulted in an increase of all three frequencies, albeit to differing degrees. The most prominent increase was observed in microsatellite instability. The increase in HRF was the lowest, although still statistically significant. The analysis of methylation of the 35S promoter and transgene expression showed that the greater instability of the transgene was not attributed to these changes. Strand breaks brought about a significant increase in non-treated tissues of infected plants. The expression of genes associated with various repair processes, such as KU70, RAD51, MSH2, DNA POL \u03b1 and DNA POL \u03b4, was also increased. To summarize, our data demonstrate that local ORMV infection destabilizes the genome in systemic tissues of Arabidopsis plants in various ways resulting in large rearrangements, point mutations and microsatellite instability.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) somatic mutations have been identified in nearly all kinds of cancer during the past decade. Normally one need to determine the complete mtDNA sequences from both cancerous and normal tissues of the same patient to score the somatic mutation in cancer. In this study, we intended to explore a strategy to quickly identify somatic mutations in the entire mtDNA genome based on its phylogeny. The principal assumption for this strategy is that somatic mutations, as recently accumulated in cancerous tissue, have younger age and will be located in the terminal branches of mtDNA phylogenetic tree. In contrast, the haplogroup-specific variants, which appear as germline variants and have ancient age, will be located in the basal or intermediate-node branches of the tree, depending on their relative age. When the complete mtDNA sequence of the cancerous tissue is determined and is classified relative to the available mtDNA phylogeny, we only need to screen the variants that are located in the terminal branch in the paracancerous tissue or other normal tissue from the same patient to identify somatic mutations in cancer. We validated this strategy by using paired gastric cancer tissue and paracancerous tissue or blood from 10 Chinese patients (including one with gastric stromal tumor). A total of seven somatic mutations were identified in the cancerous tissues from four patients. Our result suggests that employing mtDNA phylogenetic knowledge facilitates rapid identification of mitochondrial genome somatic mutations in cancer.",

Normal lung and tumor tissue carrying this mutation showed markedly lower 8-oxoG incision activity than the mean for all patients. The predominant polymorphism of OGG1 was Ser326Cys. A significant difference was observed in the frequencies of the OGG1 variants between populations of NSCLC patients and controls. The frequency of the Cys326 allele and the number of Cys326Cys homozygotes was higher among patients than controls. In individuals with either Ser326Cys or Cys326Cys genotype 8-oxoG incision rate was lower than in those with both Ser326 alleles, either in lung or leukocytes. Moreover, 8-oxodG level was higher in lung tissue and leukocytes of patients carrying two Cys326 alleles and in leukocytes of patients with the Ser326Cys genotype. We also screened for polymorphisms of the XRCC1 gene. Only heterozygotes of the XRCC1 variants Arg194Trp, Arg280His and Arg399Gln were found among patients and controls, with the frequency of Arg280His being significantly higher among patients. NSCLC patients with Arg280His or Arg399Gln polymorphism revealed lower 8-oxoG incision activity in their lung tissues, but not in leukocytes. We can conclude that the OGG1 Ser326Cys polymorphisms may have an impact on the efficiency of 8-oxoG incision in humans and the XRCC1 His280 and Gln399 may influence the OGG1 activity in tissues exposed to chronic oxidative/inflammatory stress. Higher frequency of the OGG1 Cys326 allele among NSCLC patients may partially explain the impairment of the 8-oxoG repair observed in their leukocytes.",

We showed that irradiation of DC-precursors in vitro does not influence surface marker expression or cytokine profile of immature DCs nor of mature DCs after LPS treatment. There was no difference of single dose irradiation versus fractionated irradiation protocols on the behavior of the mature DCs. Further, the low dose irradiation did not change the capacity of the DCs to stimulate T-cell proliferation. But the irradiation of the co-culture of DCs and T-cells revealed significantly lower proliferation of T-cells with higher doses.

     "abstract": "One of the key consequences of exposure of human cells to genotoxic agents is the activation of DNA damage responses (DDR). While the mechanisms underpinning DDR in fully differentiated somatic human cells have been studied extensively, molecular signaling events and pathways involved in DDR in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESC) remain largely unexplored. We studied changes in the human genome-wide transcriptome of H9 hESC line following exposures to 1\u00a0Gy of gamma-radiation at 2\u00a0h and 16\u00a0h post-irradiation. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to verify the expression data for a subset of genes. In parallel, the cell growth, DDR kinetics, and expression of pluripotency markers in irradiated hESC were monitored. The changes in gene expression in hESC after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) are substantially different from those observed in somatic human cell lines. Gene expression patterns at 2\u00a0h post-IR showed almost an exclusively p53-dependent, predominantly pro-apoptotic, signature with a total of only 30 up-regulated genes. In contrast, the gene expression patterns at 16\u00a0h post-IR showed 354 differentially expressed genes, mostly involved in pro-survival pathways, such as increased expression of metallothioneins, ubiquitin cycle, and general metabolism signaling. Cell growth data paralleled trends in gene expression changes. DDR in hESC followed the kinetics reported for human somatic differentiated cells. The expression of pluripotency markers characteristic of undifferentiated hESC was not affected by exposure to IR during the time course of our analysis. Our data on dynamics of transcriptome response of irradiated hESCs may provide a valuable tool to screen for markers of IR exposure of human cells in their most naive state; thus unmasking the key elements of DDR; at the same time, avoiding the complexity of interpreting distinct cell type-dependent genotoxic stress responses of terminally differentiated cells.",

     "abstract": "Various in vitro test systems have been developed for genotoxic risk assessment in early drug development. However, these genotoxicity tests often show limited specificity, and provide limited insights into the mode of toxicity of the tested compounds. To identify genes that could serve as specific biomarkers for genotoxicity or oxidative stress, we exposed mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells to various genotoxic and oxidative stress-inducing compounds and performed genome-wide expression profiling. Differentially expressed genes were classified based on the fold-change of expression and their specificity for either genotoxic or oxidative stress. Promoter regions of four selected genes (Ephx1, Btg2, Cbr3 and Perp) were fused to a DsRed fluorescent reporter gene and stably integrated in mouse ES cells. Established stable reporter cell lines displayed significant induction of DsRed expression upon exposure to different classes of genotoxic and oxidative stress-inducing compounds. In contrast, exposure to non-genotoxic carcinogenic compounds did not induce DsRed expression even at cytotoxic doses. Expression of the Cbr3-DsRed reporter was more responsive to compounds that induce oxidative stress while the other three DsRed reporters reacted more specific to direct-acting genotoxic agents. Therefore, the differential response of the Btg2- and Cbr3-DsRed reporters can serve as indicator for the main action mechanism of genotoxic and oxidative stress-inducing compounds. In addition, we provide evidence that inhibition of DNA replication results in preferential activation of the Btg2-DsRed genotoxicity reporter. In conclusion, we have generated sensitive mouse ES cell reporter systems that allow detection of genotoxic and oxidative stress-inducing properties of chemical compounds and can be used in high-throughput assays.",

Cell viability was reduced in response to IKA (IC50 of 221.3\u00a0nM), while the amount of HL-60 cells with a subdiploid DNA content increased significantly after 24\u00a0h. Apoptotic cell death was confirmed by the cleavage of caspase-9, -8 and -3 using immunoblotting. Single cell gel electrophoresis pointed to an early genotoxic effect. Monitoring of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) levels by flow cytometric analysis of Fluo-3-AM fluorescence indicated an increase in cytosolic calcium that correlated with the cleavage of caspases. In addition, IKA triggered the activation of p38 MAP kinase which was partly dependent on elevated [Ca2+]i concentrations and contributed to caspase activation. The data demonstrate that IKA induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells through genotoxicity and caspase activation which was in part correlated to an increase in intracellular calcium levels and activation of p38 MAP kinase.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The prominent damages caused by H2O2 include the ruin of membrane integrity, loss of intracellular neuronal glutathione (GSH), oxidative damage to DNA as well as the subsequent caspase-3 and p53 activation. Icariin is a flavonoid extracted from the traditional Chinese herb Epimedium brevicornum Maxim. We have previously reported that icariin has a good curative effect on patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD animal and cell models. However, the molecular mechanism of how icariin exerts neuroprotective effects is still not well understood. To address this question, we exposed undifferentiated neuronal cell lines (PC12 cells) to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and investigated the possible neuroprotective mechanisms of icariin. Vitamin E was used as a positive control. We observed that H2O2 activated the JNK/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and induced PC12 cells apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. More over, we demonstrated that icariin protected PC12 cells by attenuating LDH leakage, reducing GSH depletion, preventing DNA oxidation damage and inhibiting subsequent activation of caspase-3 and p53, which are the main targets of H2O2-induced cell damage. In addition, we also found that icariin's neuroprotective effect may partly correlate with its inhibitory effect on JNK/p38 MAPK pathways. Therefore, our findings suggest that icariin is a candidate for a novel neuroprotective drug to against oxidative-stress induced neurodegeneration.",

The possible role of genetic factors has also been suggested and MPM has been associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of xenobiotic and oxidative metabolism enzymes. We have identified an association of the DNA repair gene XRCC1 with MPM in the population of Casale Monferrato, a town exposed to high asbestos pollution. To extend this observation we examined 35 SNPs in 15 genes that could be involved in MPM carcinogenicity in 220 MPM patients and 296 controls from two case\u2013control studies conducted in Casale (151 patients, 252 controls) and Turin (69 patients, 44 controls), respectively. Unconditional multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Two DNA repair genes were associated with MPM, i.e. XRCC1 and ERCC1. Considering asbestos-exposed only, the risk increased with the increasing number of XRCC1-399Q alleles (Casale: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.44, 95%CI 1.02\u20132.03; Casale\u00a0+\u00a0Turin: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.34, 95%CI 0.98\u20131.84) or XRCC1 \u221277T alleles (Casale\u00a0+\u00a0Turin: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95%CI 0.97\u20131.81).

This is the first study in which the functional impact of ERCC1 N118N on gene expression and platinum sensitivity was explored. The aim of this study is to investigate if the reduced codon usage frequency of AAT, which contains the variant allele of the silent mutation, has functional impact on ERCC1 in a well-controlled biological system. Specifically, the ERCC1 cDNA clone with either the C or T allele was introduced into an ERCC1 deficient cell line, UV20, and assayed for the effect of the two alleles on ERCC1 transcription, translation and platinum sensitivity. Both ERCC1 mRNA and protein expression levels increased upon cisplatin treatment, peaking at 4\u00a0h post-treatment, however there were no differences between the two alleles (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Cells complemented with ERCC1 showed significantly higher survival proportion than the parental cell line following platinum exposure (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), although no differences were observed between the cells transfected with the wild type or the polymorphic allele. These data suggest that N118N itself is not related to the phenotypic differences in ERCC1 expression or function, but rather this polymorphism may be linked to other causative variants or haplotypes.",

Here we examine ATM kinase activation in cells exposed to either 32P- or 33P-orthophosphate under conditions typically employed in metabolic labelling experiments. We calculate that the absorbed dose of IR delivered to a 5\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05\u00a0cm monolayer of cells incubated in 2\u00a0ml media containing 1\u00a0mCi of the high-energy (1.70\u00a0MeV) \u03b2-particle emitter 32P-orthophosphate for 30\u00a0min is \u223c1\u00a0Gy IR. The absorbed dose of IR following an otherwise identical exposure to the low-energy (0.24\u00a0MeV) \u03b2-particle emitter 33P-orthophosphate is \u223c0.18\u00a0Gy IR. We show that low-energy \u03b2-particles emitted by 33P induce a greater number of ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) and greater ATM kinase signaling than energetic \u03b2-particles emitted by 32P. Hence, we demonstrate that it is inappropriate to use 33P-orthophosphate as a negative control for 32P-orthophosphate in experiments investigating DNA damage responses to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Significantly, we show that ATM accumulates in the chromatin fraction when ATM kinase activity is inhibited during exposure to either radionuclide. Finally, we also show that chromosome aberrations accumulate in cells when ATM kinase activity is inhibited during exposure to \u223c0.36\u00a0Gy \u03b2-particles emitted by 33P. We therefore propose that direct cellular exposure to 33P-orthophosphate is an excellent means to induce and label the IR-induced, ATM kinase-dependent phosphoproteome.",

     "abstract": "Microsatellites mutate frequently by replication slippage. Empirical evidence shows that the probability of such slippage mutations may increase with the length of the repeat region as well as exposure to environmental mutagens, but the mutation rate can also differ between the male and female germline. It has been hypothesized that more intense sexual selection or sperm competition can also lead to elevated mutation rates, but the empirical evidence is inconclusive. Here, we analyzed the occurrence of germline slippage mutations in the hypervariable pentanucleotide microsatellite locus HrU10 across six species of swallow (Aves: Hirundinidae). These species exhibit marked differences in the length range of the microsatellite, as well as differences in the intensity of sperm competition. We found a strong effect of microsatellite length on the probability of mutation, but no residual effect of species or their level of sperm competition when the length effect was accounted for. Neither could we detect any difference in mutation rate between tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) breeding in Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, an industrial site with previous documentation of elevated mutation rates for minisatellite DNA, and a rural reference population. However, our cross-species analysis revealed two significant patterns of sex differences in HrU10 germline mutations: (1) mutations in longer alleles occurred typically in the male germline, those in shorter alleles in the female germline, and (2) male germline mutations were more often expansions than contractions, whereas no directional bias was evident in the female germline. These results indicate some fundamental differences in male and female gametogenesis affecting the probability of slippage mutations. Our study also reflects the value of a comparative, multi-species approach for locus-specific mutation analyses, through which a wider range of influential factors can be assessed than in single-species studies.",

No significant differences were found between chondrocytes and PBL in control subjects. Chromosome loss was the more frequent aneuploidy, mainly monosomy 18. The decreased telomere size and increased chromosome instability in chondrocytes from OA affected joints may imply a local advanced senescence that could contribute to the pathogenesis or progression of the degenerative articular disease. Moreover, the increased chromosomal abnormalities in PBL from OA patients suggest a more general accelerated senescence phenotype that could promote the age-related degenerative joint pathology.",

     "abstract": "Piwil2 (mili in mouse or hili in humans), a member of the PIWI/Argonaute gene family, plays important roles in stem cell self-renewal, RNA silencing, and translational regulation in various organisms. Recent demonstration of stable Piwil2 expression in pre-cancerous stem cells and in various human and animal tumor cell lines suggests its association in tumorigenesis. Here, we show that cisplatin induces chromatin relaxation in Mili-wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), but not in Mili-knockout (KO) MEFs. Moreover, in contrast to Mili-WT MEFs, Mili-KO MEFs showed a discernable H3 hypoacetylation response upon cisplatin treatment. Levels of the histone acetyltransferase (HAT), p300, were dramatically different due to a consistent cisplatin post-treatment decrease in Mili-WT and an increase in Mili-KO MEFs. Concomitant reduction of specific HAT activity of p300 could explain the decrease of H3 acetylation in Mili-KO MEFs. Our data also shows Mili is required for maintaining the euchromatic marks in MEFs upon cisplatin treatment. In addition, Mili-KO MEFs exhibited a significant deficiency in repairing cisplatin-induced DNA damage and displayed higher sensitivity to cisplatin. Further analysis revealed that Piwil2 was also enhanced in two completely different cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines. Interestingly, knockdown of Piwil2 expression in these two cell lines also resulted in their enhanced sensitivity to cisplatin and decreased their efficiency for removing cisplatin-induced DNA intrastrand crosslinks (Pt-GG). The overall data showed that Piwil2 is a key factor in regulating chromatin modifications especially in response to cisplatin. To conclude, the overexpression of Piwil2 in some cancers could lead to cellular cisplatin resistance, possibly due to enhanced chromatin condensation affecting normal DNA repair.",

In the present study, our main aim was to study the impact of these two kinds of alterations of FHIT gene in breast cancer patients of Kashmir.We screened a total of 130 breast cancer patients of Kashmir by PCR-SSCP followed by direct sequencing and methylation specific PCR.Mutational screening of FHIT gene revealed significant amount of mutations [40.7% (53/130)] in five hot spot exons (exon 5\u20139), FHIT promoter was found to be hypermethylated in 59 of 130 [45.3%] breast cancer patients in our population.In the present study we have shown a significant association between the mutational and hypermethylation profile of FHIT gene. Hence, we provide the first evidence to our knowledge that the significant association of FHIT mutation and hypermethylation leads to the complete inactivation of FHIT gene in patients with breast cancer. Silencing of the FHIT gene by promoter hypermethylation occurs in breast carcinomas, especially those with the significant amount of mutations.",

The current study shows the molecular behavior of the MutT protein in vivo and in vitro with special reference to control of spontaneous mutagenesis. A single E. coli cell carries about 70\u201375 molecules of the MutT protein and that this number does not change even when the cells were cultured in anaerobic and hyper-oxidative conditions. Conditional gene silencing analyses revealed that about a half number of MutT molecules are needed for keeping the spontaneous mutation frequency at the normal level. The MutT functions are not needed under anaerobic condition, yet the level of the MutT protein in cell is kept constant, probably for preparing for sudden changes of oxygen pressure. There is a possibility that MutT functions in close association with other proteins, and evidence is presented that MutT protein can interact with some proteins in vivo.",

     "abstract": "The mammalian Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) is involved in critical roles such as growth-related signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation, development, apoptosis and angiogenesis. Also, KLF6 appears to be an emerging key factor during cancer development and progression. Its expression is thoroughly regulated by several cell-damaging stimuli. DNA damaging agents at lethal concentrations induce a p53-independent down-regulation of the klf6 gene.To investigate the impact of external stimuli on human klf6 gene expression, its mRNA level was analyzed using a cancer cell line profiling array system, consisting in an assortment of immobilized cDNAs from multiple cell lines treated with several cell-damaging agents at growth inhibitory concentrations (IC50).Cell-damaging agents affected the klf6 expression in 62% of the cDNA samples, though the expression pattern was not dependent on the cell origin type. Interestingly, significant differences (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in KLF6 mRNA levels were observed depending on the cellular p53 status upon cell damage. KLF6 expression was significantly increased in 63% of p53-deficient cells (122/195). Conversely, KLF6 mRNA level decreased nearly 4 fold in more than 70% of p53+/+ cells. In addition, klf6 gene promoter activity was down-regulated by DNA damaging agents in cells expressing the functional p53 protein whereas it was moderately increased in the absence of functional p53. Consistent results were obtained for the endogenous KLF6 protein level.Results indicate that human klf6 gene expression is responsive to external cell damage mediated by IC50 concentrations of physical and chemical stimuli in a p53-dependent manner. Most of these agents are frequently used in cancer therapy. Induction of klf6 expression in the absence of functional p53 directly correlates with cell death triggered by these compounds, whereas it is down-regulated in p53+/+ cells. Hence, klf6 expression level could represent a valuable marker for the efficiency of cell death upon cancer treatment.",

This study tests the hypothesis that irradiation induces epigenetic aberrations, which could eventually lead to RIGI, and that the epigenetic aberrations induced by low linear energy transfer (LET) irradiation are different than those induced by high LET irradiations. GM10115 cells were irradiated with low LET X-rays and high LET iron (Fe) ions and evaluated for DNA damage, cell survival and chromosomal instability. The cells were also evaluated for specific locus methylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF\u03baB), tumor suppressor in lung cancer 1 (TSLC1) and cadherin 1 (CDH1) gene promoter regions, long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) and Alu repeat element methylation, CpG and non-CpG global methylation and miRNA expression levels. Irradiated cells showed increased micronucleus induction and cell killing immediately following exposure, but were chromosomally stable at delayed times post-irradiation. At this same delayed time, alterations in repeat element and global DNA methylation and miRNA expression were observed. Analyses of DNA methylation predominantly showed hypomethylation, however hypermethylation was also observed. We demonstrate that miRNA expression levels can be altered after X-ray irradiation and that these miRNA are involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation. A higher incidence of epigenetic changes was observed after exposure to X-rays than Fe ions even though Fe ions elicited more chromosomal damage and cell killing. This distinction is apparent at miRNA analyses at which only three miRNA involved in two major pathways were altered after high LET irradiations while six miRNA involved in five major pathways were altered after low LET irradiations. This study also shows that the irradiated cells acquire epigenetic changes suggesting that epigenetic aberrations may arise in the cell without initiating chromosomal instability.",

Levels of c-PAHs were significantly higher in winter than spring, while exposure to PM2.5 was higher in May than in February 2007. We did not observe any significant difference between the two seasons for any biomarker of oxidative stress (8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine, 8-oxodG, 15-F2t-isoprostane, 15-F2t-IsoP, protein carbonyl levels) or any cytogenetic parameter, including the genomic frequency of translocations (FG/100), the percentage of aberrant cells (%AB.C.) or the number of acentric fragments (ace). Analyses of associations between oxidative stress biomarkers and cytogenetic parameters showed a negative relationship between protein oxidation and FG/100, as well as protein oxidation and ace. We further analyzed the effect of air pollution on all subjects regardless of the season. Data from stationary monitors showed that 8-oxodG levels were significantly increased by exposure to PM2.5 over a 2-day period before sampling and by exposure to B[a]P over a 28-day period, days 57\u201384 before sampling. 15-F2t-IsoP levels were increased after exposure to B[a]P over both 2-day and 3-day periods preceding sample collection and after exposure to c-PAHs over a 2-day period before sampling. %AB.C. was significantly affected by exposure to B[a]P over a 14-day period, days 57\u201370 before sampling.

However, the effect of antroquinonol on cell signalling and survival pathways in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells has not been fully demarcated. Here we report that antroquinonol treatment significantly reduced the proliferation of three NSCLC cells. Treatment of A549 cells with antroquinonol increased cell shrinkage, apoptotic vacuoles, pore formation, TUNEL positive cells and increased Sub-G1 cell population with respect to time and dose dependent manner. Antroquinonol treatment not only increased the Sub-G1 accumulation but also reduced the protein levels of cdc2 without altering the expression of cyclin B1, cdc25C, pcdc2, and pcdc25C. Antroquinonol induced apoptosis was associated with disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of Caspase 3 and PARP cleavage in A549 cells. Moreover, antroquinonol treatment down regulated the expression of Bcl2 proteins, which was correlated with the decreased PI3K and mTOR protein levels without altering pro apoptotic and anti apoptotic proteins. Results from the microarray analysis demonstrated that antroquinonol altered the expression level of miRNAs compared with untreated control in A549 cells. The data collectively suggested the antiproliferative effect of antroquinonol on NSCLC A549 cells, which provides useful information for understanding the anticancer mechanism influenced by antroquinonol and is the first report to suggest that antroquinonol may be a promising chemotherapeutic agent for lung cancer.",

The hq mutation results in downregulation of the apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif) gene with conflicting reports of elevated oxidative stress in neurons. Previously, the cerebellum of hq disease mice was reported to have a three-fold elevated frequency of \u22121\u00a0bp deletions at a monobasic run (G11), a common mutation signature of reactive oxygen species [1]. To examine a diversity of mutations types associated with oxidative DNA damage, the frequency and nature of spontaneous cII mutations were determined in the cerebellum of three- and seven-month-old hq disease and Aif-proficient Big Blue\u00ae mice. Unlike the previous report, no elevation in spontaneous mutation frequency was observed in the cerebellum of hq disease compared to Aif-proficient mice. The G11 sequence used in the previous study may be particularly susceptible to oxidative DNA damage leading to replication errors and the previous assay may detect transcriptional errors. We observed intrachromosomal deletions (10\u201321\u00a0bp) associated with oxidative DNA damage exclusively in the cerebellum of four out of five young hq disease mice (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001). The pattern of mutation in the cerebellum of hq disease and Aif-proficient mice was similar. This mutation pattern is typical of previous reports of spontaneous mutations across multiple tissues and ages of wild type mice. Finally, an Aif-proficient mouse had the heaviest mutation shower yet reported with seven point mutations over 21\u00a0bp in a single mutant, consistent with transient hypermutability, a phenomenon relevant to disease and genome evolution.",

     "abstract": "In earlier studies, we showed that abiotic stresses, such as ionizing radiation, heavy metals, temperature and water, trigger an increase in homologous recombination frequency (HRF). We also demonstrated that many of these stresses led to inheritance of high-frequency homologous recombination, HRF. Although an increase in recombination frequency is an important indicator of genome rearrangements, it only represents a minor portion of possible stress-induced mutations.Here, we analyzed the influence of heat, cold, drought, flood and UVC abiotic stresses on two major types of mutations in the genome, point mutations and small deletions/insertions. We used two transgenic lines of Arabidopsis thaliana, one allowing an analysis of reversions in a stop codon-containing inactivated \u03b2-glucuronidase transgene and another one allowing an analysis of repeat stability in a microsatellite-interrupted \u03b2-glucuronidase transgene. The transgenic Arabidopsis line carrying the \u03b2-glucuronidase-based homologous recombination substrate was used as a positive control. We showed that the majority of stresses increased the frequency of point mutations, homologous recombination and microsatellite instability in somatic cells, with the frequency of homologous recombination being affected the most. The analysis of transgenerational changes showed an increase in HRF to be the most prominent effect observed in progeny. Significant changes in recombination frequency were observed upon exposure to all types of stress except drought, whereas changes in microsatellite instability were observed upon exposure to UVC, heat and cold. The frequency of point mutations in the progeny of stress-exposed plants was the least affected; an increase in mutation frequency was observed only in the progeny of plants exposed to UVC. We thus conclude that transgenerational changes in genome stability in response to stress primarily involve an increase in recombination frequency.",

Here we explored cadmium induced radioadaptive response (RAR) and investigated the role of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ATM kinase in this response. Our data showed that the cadmium ions with a sub-lethal concentration could induce RAR in Chang liver cells towards subsequent \u03b3-irradiation and this response could be abrogated by DL-propargylglycine (PPG), the endogenous H2S synthetase inhibitor of cystathionine \u03b3-lyase (CSE), but not by aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA), the inhibitor of cystathionine \u03b2-synthase (CBS). Moreover, the pretreatment of cells with NaHS also stimulated cellular adaptive response to radiation. Both cadmium treatment and irradiation up-regulated the expression of CSE protein in a time-dependent manner but had no influence on the expression of CBS protein. In the primed cells, the time course of CBS expression showed no significant difference with the cells treated with 2Gy irradiation alone, however, the CSE expression was easier to reach the maximum level, indicating a more efficient H2S production by CSE. Moreover, the cadmium-induced RAR was totally suppressed by KU-55933, a specific ATM inhibitor that did not change the CSE expression after radiation. However, exogenous H2S decreased the phosphorylation level of radiation-induced ATM. In conclusion, the present results demonstrate firstly that H2S is involved in the cadmium induced cross-adaptive response to challenging radiation. CSE, rather than CBS, may mainly responsible for the H2S production during this RAR which may also be mediated by ATM pathway. However, the activation of CSE is independent of ATM but could negatively regulate the phosphorylation of ATM.",

We identify that DRB triggers an increase in homologous recombination within the hprt gene as well as increasing RAD51 foci formation in mammalian cells. Furthermore, we find that DRB-induced transcriptional stress is associated with formation of the nuclear foci of the phosphorylated form of H2AX (\u03b3H2AX). We accounted that about 72% of RAD51 foci co-localized with the observed \u03b3H2AX foci. Interestingly, we find that XRCC3 mutated, homologous recombination defective cells are hypersensitive to the toxic effect of DRB and fail to form RAD51 foci.

XRCC3 T241M polymorphism was determined using conventional PCR-sequencing method. Chromosomal aberration assay, arsenic-induced neuropathy and ocular diseases were also evaluated. The data revealed that presence of at least one Met allele (Met/Met or Thr/Met) was protective towards development of arsenic-induced skin lesions [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.45, 95% CI: 0.30\u20130.67], peripheral neuropathy [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.49; 95%CI: 0.30\u20130.82] and conjunctivitis [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.60; 95%CI: 0.40\u20130.92].

     "abstract": "A hallmark of aberrant DNA methylation-associated silencing is reversibility. However, long-term stability of reactivated promoters has not been explored. To examine this issue, spontaneous reactivant clones were isolated from mouse embryonal carcinoma cells bearing aberrantly silenced Aprt alleles and re-silencing frequencies were determined as long as three months after reactivation occurred. Despite continuous selection for expression of the reactivated Aprt alleles, exceptionally high spontaneous re-silencing frequencies were observed. A DNA methylation analysis demonstrated retention of sporadic methylation of CpG sites in a protected region of the Aprt promoter in many reactivant alleles suggesting a role for these methylated sites in the re-silencing process. In contrast, a chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis for methyl-H3K4, acetyl-H3K9, and dimethyl-H3K9 levels failed to reveal a specific histone modification that could explain high frequency re-silencing. These results demonstrate that aberrantly silenced and reactivated promoters retain a persistent memory of having undergone the silencing process and suggest the failure to eliminate all CpG methylation as a potential contributing mechanism.",

     "abstract": "The use of innocuous naturally occurring compounds to overcome drug resistance and cancer recalcitrance is now in the forefront of cancer research. Thymoquinone (TQ) is a bioactive constituent of the volatile oil derived from seeds of Nigella sativa Linn. TQ has shown promising anti-carcinogenic and anti-tumor activities through different mechanisms. However, the effect of TQ on cell signaling and survival pathways in resistant cancer cells has not been fully delineated. Here, we report that TQ greatly inhibits doxorubicin-resistant human breast cancer MCF-7/DOX cell proliferation. TQ treatment increased cellular levels of PTEN proteins, resulting in a substantial decrease of phosphorylated Akt, a known regulator of cell survival. The PTEN expression was accompanied with elevation of PTEN mRNA. TQ arrested MCF-7/DOX cells at G2/M phase and increased cellular levels of p53 and p21 proteins. Flow cytometric analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis revealed a significant increase in Sub-G1 cell population and appearance of DNA ladders following TQ treatment, indicating cellular apoptosis. TQ-induced apoptosis was associated with disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspases and PARP cleavage in MCF-7/DOX cells. Moreover, TQ treatment increased Bax/Bcl2 ratio via up-regulating Bax and down-regulating Bcl2 proteins. More importantly, PTEN silencing by target specific siRNA enabled the suppression of TQ-induced apoptosis resulting in increased cell survival. Our results reveal that up-regulation of the key upstream signaling factor, PTEN, in MCF-7/DOX cells inhibited Akt phosphorylation, which ultimately causes increase in their regulatory p53 levels affecting the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Overall results provide mechanistic insights for understanding the molecular basis and utility of the anti-tumor activity of TQ.",

The MMR pathway can also trigger a DNA damage response upon binding of MutS\u03b1 to specific DNA lesions such as O6methylguanine (O6meG). Limited information is available regarding cellular regulation of these two different pathways. Within this report, we demonstrate that phosphorylated hMSH6 increases in concentration in the presence of a G:T mismatch, as compared to an O6meG:T lesion. TPA, a kinase activator, enhances the phosphorylation of hMSH6 and binding of hMutS\u03b1 to a G:T mismatch, though not to O6meG:T. UCN-01, a kinase inhibitor, decreases both phosphorylation of hMSH6 and binding of hMutS\u03b1 to G:T and O6meG:T. HeLa MR cells, pretreated with UCN-01 and exposed to MNNG, undergo activation of Cdk1 and mitosis despite phosphorylation of Chk1 and inactivating phosphorylation of Cdc25c. These results indicate that UCN-01 may inhibit an alternative cell cycle arrest pathway associated with the MMR pathway that does not involve Cdc25c. In addition, recombinant hMutS\u03b1 containing hMSH6 mutated at an N-terminal cluster of four phosphoserines exhibits decreased phosphorylation and decreased binding of hMutS\u03b1 to G:T and O6meG:T. Taken together, these results suggest a model in which the amount of phosphorylated hMSH6 bound to DNA is dependent on the presence of either a DNA mismatch or DNA alkylation damage. We hypothesize that both phosphorylation of hMSH6 and total concentration of bound hMutS\u03b1 are involved in cellular signaling of either DNA mismatch repair or MMR-dependent damage recognition activities.",

Arrested polymerases form a stable ternary complex at the site of DNA damage that is thought to pose an impediment to the repair of these lesions. Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER) preferentially repairs these DNA lesions through an incompletely defined mechanism. Based on elegant in vitro experiments, it was hypothesized that the transcription elongation factor IIS (TFIIS) may be required to couple transcription to repair by catalyzing the reverse translocation of the arrested polymerase, allowing access of repair proteins to the site of DNA damage. However the role of TFIIS in this repair process has not been tested in vivo. Here, silencing TFIIS using an RNA interference strategy did not affect the ability of cells to recover nascent RNA synthesis following UV exposure or the ability of cells to repair a UV-damaged reporter gene while a similar strategy to decrease the expression Cockayne syndrome group B protein (CSB) resulted in the expected repair defect. Furthermore, RNA interference against TFIIS did not increase the sensitivity of cells to UV light or cisplatin while decreased expression of CSB did. Taken together, these results indicate that TFIIS is not limiting for the repair of transcription-blocking DNA lesions and thus the present work does not support a role for TFIIS in TC-NER.",

The effect was observed in both human primary fibroblast (NHLF) and cancer cells (HeLa) using two-cell co-culture systems. After co-culturing irradiated cells with unirradiated bystander cells for 24\u00a0h, the numbers of 53BP1 foci, corresponding to the number of DNA double-strand breaks in the irradiated cells were less than those in the irradiated cells that were not co-cultured with the bystander cells (0.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0foci/cell vs. 0.90\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.04\u00a0foci/cell) at a statistically significant level.

We also demonstrate that an imbalance between cell proliferation and apoptosis, rather than enhanced cell proliferation or apoptosis suppression alone, may be a driving force for carcinogenesis. Our studies further suggest that compromised functional activity of p53 may be one of the mechanisms responsible for the proliferation/apoptosis imbalance.In sum, the results of our study indicate that evaluation of the extent of cell proliferation and apoptosis before the onset of preneoplastic lesions may be a potential biomarker of breast cancer risk after exposure to breast carcinogens.",

However, the mechanism of carcinogenesis by amitrole remains to be clarified. To clarify the mechanism of carcinogenesis induced by amitrole, we investigated the formation of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2\u2032-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), a characteristic of oxidatively generated DNA damage, by an amitrole metabolite, 3-amino-5-mercapto-1,2,4-triazole (AMT), in the presence of Cu(II). The amount of 8-oxodG was increased by AMT in the presence of Cu(II). AMT-induced 8-oxodG formation was enhanced in deuterium oxide (D2O), which prolongs the half life of singlet oxygen (1O2), more than that in H2O. Sodium azide and 1,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]-octane (DABCO), potent and relatively specific scavengers of 1O2, inhibited AMT-mediated 8-oxodG formation. Bathocuproine, a Cu(I) chelator, also inhibited the 8-oxodG formation. On the other hand, typical OH scavengers did not inhibit the generation of 8-oxodG. AMT plus Cu(II) also induced piperidine-labile DNA lesions frequently at every guanine residue. These results suggest that 1O2 and Cu(I) play an important role in DNA damage induced by AMT. It is concluded that oxidatively generated DNA damage induced by AMT via the generation of 1O2 may contribute to carcinogenicity of amitrole.",

Here, we performed a targeted investigation of selected genes (i) involved in longevity pathways (insulin receptor/insulin-like growth factor-I signaling and energy metabolism, intracellular signaling, apoptosis and stress response) and (ii) in which mutations lead to genetic perturbations in animal models or human diseases. Altogether, we tested 500 nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 343 candidate genes for association with the longevity phenotype in a German sample comprising about 400 centenarians and an equal number of younger control subjects.

MutS1 is distinguished by the N-terminal mismatch binding domain containing the GXFXE motif shared by all MutS1 homologues and MSH6 homologues in eukaryotes.

Functionally active Topoisomerase II (Topo II), through its mechanism of concerted breaking and rejoining of double stranded DNA, is required to carry out this fundamental process. In previous studies we have shown that modifications in DNA sequence by halogenated pyrimidines and by the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine leads to malfunction of Topo II that results in an increased yield of endorreduplicated cells as a result of segregation failure. In the present work we have evaluated the possible influence of the methylating agent Budesonide to modify the frequency of endoreduplicated cells in AA8 Chinese hamster cell population. Our results seem to indicate that when Budesonide was administered for two consecutive cell cycles did induce an increase in the yield of endoreduplicated cells, as previously observed for the hypomethylating agent 5-azaC. We have also examined the possible relationship between extensive hypermethylation induced by Budesonide in DNA and stabilization of cleavable complexes by m-AMSA. Taken as a whole, our results show that the degree of methylation in DNA correlates with the effectiveness of m-AMSA to stabilize the Topo II\u2013DNA complexes and to induce DNA cleavage. These findings evidence for the first time the functional importance of DNA hyper- and hypomethylation changes as epigenetic factors able to modulate Topo II activity for proper chromosome segregation.",

     "abstract": "The well established toxicity of cadmium and cadmium compounds results from their additive effects on several key cellular processes, including DNA repair. Mammalian cells have evolved several biochemical pathways to repair DNA lesions and maintain genomic integrity. By interfering with the homeostasis of redox metals and antioxidant systems, cadmium promotes the development of an intracellular environment that results in oxidative DNA damage which can be mutagenic if unrepaired. Small base lesions are recognised by specialized glycosylases and excised from the DNA molecule. The resulting abasic sites are incised, and the correct sequences restored by DNA polymerases using the opposite strands as template. Bulky lesions are recognised by a different set of proteins and excised from DNA as part of an oligonucleotide. As in base repair, the resulting gaps are filled by DNA polymerases using the opposite strands as template. Thus, these two repair pathways consist in excision of the lesion followed by DNA synthesis. In this study, we analysed in vitro the direct effects of cadmium exposure on the functionality of base and nucleotide DNA repair pathways. To this end, we used recently described dedicated microarrays that allow the parallel monitoring in cell extracts of the repair activities directed against several model base and/or nucleotide lesions. Both base and nucleotide excision/repair pathways are inhibited by CdCl2, with different sensitivities. The inhibitory effects of cadmium affect mainly the recognition and excision stages of these processes. Furthermore, our data indicate that the repair activities directed against different damaged bases also exhibit distinct sensitivities, and the direct comparison of cadmium effects on the excision of uracile in different sequences even allows us to propose a hierarchy of cadmium sensibility within the glycosylases removing U from DNA. These results indicate that, in our experimental conditions, cadmium is a very potent DNA repair poison.",

     "abstract": "DSS1 is a small, highly acidic protein widely conserved among eukaryotes as a component of the 19S proteasome and implicated in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. The BRCA2 tumor suppressor protein functions in homologous recombinational repair (HRR) of DNA double-strand breaks, and does so in part through the actions of a carboxy-proximal region that binds DNA and several other proteins, including DSS1. In the unicellular eukaryote Ustilago maydis, Dss1 interacts with Brh2, a BRCA2-like protein, and regulates its function in mediating HRR. We used RNA interference to deplete DSS1 in human cells, and assayed the effects on double-strand break repair by homologous recombination. Partial depletion of DSS1 protein in human cells reduced the efficiency of HRR to small fractions of normal levels. Residual HRR activity correlated roughly with the residual level of DSS1 expression. The results imply that mammalian DSS1 makes a critical contribution to the function of BRCA2 in mediating HRR, and hence to genomic stability. Activity of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome system can influence HRR. However, treatment with proteasome inhibitors only partially reproduced the effects of DSS1 depletion on HRR, suggesting that the function of DSS1 in HRR involves more than proteolysis per se.",

     "abstract": "Single strand breaks (SSBs) are one of the most frequent DNA lesions caused by endogenous and exogenous agents. The most utilized alkaline-based assays for SSB detection frequently give false positive results due to the presence of alkali-labile sites that are converted to SSBs. Methoxyamine, an acidic O-hydroxylamine, has been utilized to measure DNA damage in cells. However, the neutralization of methoxyamine is required prior to usage. Here we developed a convenient, specific SSB assay using alkaline gel electrophoresis (AGE) coupled with a neutral O-hydroxylamine, O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine (OTX). OTX stabilizes abasic sites (AP sites) to prevent their alkaline incision while still allowing for strong alkaline DNA denaturation. DNA from DT40 and isogenic polymerase \u03b2 null cells exposed to methyl methanesulfonate were applied to the OTX-coupled AGE (OTX-AGE) assay. Time-dependent increases in SSBs were detected in each cell line with more extensive SSB formation in the null cells. These findings were supported by an assay that indirectly detects SSBs through measuring NAD(P)H depletion. An ARP-slot blot assay demonstrated a significant time-dependent increase in AP sites in both cell lines by 1\u00a0mM MMS compared to control. Furthermore, the Pol \u03b2-null cells displayed greater AP site formation than the parental DT40 cells. OTX use represents a facile approach for assessing SSB formation, whose benefits can also be applied to other established SSB assays.",

CRC diagnosis and therapy remain dependent upon descriptive classification and staging systems, based primarily on morphology and histology. The traditional approach of understanding complex biological systems by studying smaller, discrete units of the whole system has been less fruitful for understanding complex diseases. The implicit assumption of traditional methods, that a single or even only a few factors, play a dominant role in a complex disease might be inadequate when studying multifactorial diseases such as cancer. The burgeoning field of systems biology adopts a holistic approach, wherein the integration of individual parts of the system is sought. The cornerstone of a systems biology approach has been the development of a variety of high-throughput \u201comics\u201d sciences, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics.

This information will allow us to more fully understand the heterogeneity within each tumor, as well as to identify novel genes involved in cancer development. However, the new challenge that arises will be to interpret the pathogenic significance of each genetic variant. The enormity and complexity of this challenge can be demonstrated by focusing on just the genes involved in the hereditary colon cancer syndromes, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and hereditary non-polyposis coli (HNPCC). The genes responsible for each disease were identified almost two decades ago \u2013 APC for FAP and the MMR genes for HNPCC \u2013 and a large number of germline variations have been identified in these genes in hereditary cancer patients. However, relating the effect of an individual genotype to phenotype is not always straightforward. This review focuses on the roles of the APC and MMR genes in tumor development and the work that has been done to relate different variants in each gene to functional aberrations and ultimately tumorigenesis.

A better understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis may lead to an improved ability to diagnose, treat, and even prevent this disease.

Numerous tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes are clearly involved in this process, which is associated with genomic instability and a mutator phenotype. Newer, high-throughput techniques have accelerated our ability to identify and characterize critical genomic events that contribute to this process. The most commonly used of these techniques include array-comparative genomic hybridization and single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. These technologies allow the entire genome to be mapped at high resolution using tens or even hundreds of thousands of markers in a single experiment. These and other high-throughput genomic techniques are also beginning to be applied to patient care in predicting prognosis and response to treatment in patients with colorectal cancer.

In addition to point and other small mutations targeting cancer genes, solid tumors often exhibit aneuploidy as well as multiple chromosomal rearrangements of large fragments of the genome. Whether somatic chromosomal alterations and aneuploidy are a driving force or a mere consequence of tumorigenesis remains controversial. Recently it became apparent that not only genetic but also epigenetic alterations play a major role in carcinogenesis. Epigenetic regulation mechanisms underlie the maintenance of cell identity crucial for development and differentiation. These epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been found substantially altered during cancer development and progression. In this review, we discuss approaches designed to analyze genetic and epigenetic alterations in colorectal cancer, especially DNA fingerprinting approaches to detect changes in DNA copy number and methylation.

DNA methylation, which in mammals takes place in the cytosines that precede a guanine (CpG dinucleotide), is the most well-characterized epigenetic mark. The study of aberrant DNA methylation patterns, such as hypermethylation of CpG islands and global genomic hypomethylation, are common issues in the studies on all types of cancer, and as in other areas of molecular oncology, colorectal cancer has become a privileged target. Besides the great variety of technologies available for the analysis of DNA methylation, most methods are based on three principles: methylation-sensitive enzymes, bisulphite conversion of unmethylated cytosines and immunoprecipitation of 5-methylcytosines. By combining each one of these principles with other genomic methodologies, a large range of approaches aimed at the analysis of methylation from one specific CpG site to a large number of sequences on the genome scale and suitable for different research needs have been developed.

Staphylococcal nuclease homology domain containing 1 (SND1), a component of RISC, is frequently up-regulated in human colon cancers and also chemically induced colon cancers in animals. We here showed that SDN1 is involved in miRNA-mediated gene suppression and overexpression of SND1 in colon cancer cells causes down-regulation of APC without altering APC mRNA levels. As for the miRNA expression profile in human colon cancer, miR-34a was among the list of down-regulated miRNA. Expression of miR-34a is tightly regulated by p53, and ectopic expression of miR-34a in colon cancer cells causes remarkable reduction of cell proliferation and induces senescence-like phenotypes. MiR-34a also participates in the positive feedback loop of the p53 tumor suppressor network. This circuitry mechanism for p53 activation is of interest in understanding the tumor suppressive function of miR-34a in colon carcinogenesis. miRNA should also be considered as novel anti-cancer agents in tumor suppressive therapeutic applications.",

For the carrier females gDNA sequencing was informative in 71% of the families, 23% required qPCR studies and 6% required segregation studies combined with enzymatic activity testing. Classical cDNA studies proved to be unreliable in carrier females as there is a significant risk of failure to detect the mutated allele. Four novel HPRT1 mutations were found: c.145C>T (p.Leu49Phe), c.112C>T (p.Pro38Ser), c.89_96dup8 (p.Glu33Argfs) and c.506dupC (p.Arg170Thrfs).In the diagnosis of LND it is very important to consider all the possible alterations of the HPRT1 gene when searching for mutations especially if no affected male is available.

Repair rate (rejoining of strand breaks) after treatment with H2O2 was increased by pre-treatment of Caco-2 cells for 24\u00a0h with ursolic acid or luteolin.

Luteolin protected against this damage in Caco-2 cells after a short period of incubation. We also measured the incision activity of a cell extract from Caco-2 cells treated for 24\u00a0h with test compounds, on a DNA substrate containing specific damage (8-oxoGua), to evaluate effects on base excision repair activity. Preincubation for 24\u00a0h with ursolic acid enhanced incision activity in Caco-2 cells. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that ursolic acid and luteolin not only protect DNA from oxidative damage but also increase repair activity in Caco-2 cells.

In mitomycin C (MMC)-treated cells, MNi originated in early anaphase from lagging chromosome fragments just after chromosome segregation. In \u03b3-ray-treated cells showing multipolar cell division, MN originated in late anaphase from lagging chromosome fragments generated by the abnormal cell division associated with supernumerary centrosomes. In vincristine(VC)-treated cells, MN formation was similar to that in MMC-treated cells, but MNi were also derived from whole chromosomes that did not align properly on the metaphase plate. Thus, the MN formation process induced by MMC, \u03b3-rays, and VC, were strikingly different, suggesting that different mechanisms were involved. MN stability, however, was similar regardless of the treatment and unrelated to MN formation mechanisms. MNi were stable in daughter cells, and MN-harboring cells tended to die during cell cycle progression with greater frequency than cells without MN. Because of their persistence, MN may have significant impact on cells, causing genomic instability and abnormally transcribed genes.",

Thus, the plate-incorporation assay involves plating stationary-phase cells with the mutagen, after which the cells undergo a brief lag phase and, consequently, are exposed to the mutagen and undergo mutagenesis while in the logarithmic (log) phase. In contrast, a liquid-suspension assay involves exposure of either log- or stationary-phase cells to the mutagen for a specified period of time, sometimes followed by a wash, resulting in the cells growing in medium in the absence of the mutagen. To explore global gene expression in Salmonella, and to test for possible effects of growth phase and transcriptional status on mutagenesis, we performed microarray analysis on cells of Salmonella strain TA100 exposed to the drinking-water mutagen MX in either the log or stationary phase. The genes in functional pathways involving amino acid transport and metabolism and energy metabolism were expressed differentially in log-phase cells, whereas genes in functional pathways involving protein trafficking, cell envelope, and two-component systems using common signal transduction were expressed differentially in stationary-phase cells. More than 90% of the ribosomal-protein biosynthesis genes were up-regulated in stationary- versus log-phase cells. MX was equally mutagenic to cells in log- and stationary-phase growth when the results were expressed as mutant frequencies (revertants/survivors/\u03bcM), but it was twice as mutagenic in stationary-phase cells when the results were expressed as mutant yields (revertants/nmole or revertants/\u03bcM). There was a complex transcriptional response underlying these results, with mucA/B being greatly up-regulated in log-phase cells but umuC/D up-regulated in stationary-phase cells.

Previous studies have established methylation profiles of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and demonstrated that methylation of several candidate genes in resected tissues may be associated with time to recurrence. The goals of our study were to test whether specific promoter methylation and mRNA levels of candidate genes, as well as global changes in DNA methylation, can be linked with time to recurrence and clinicopathological variables in a homogenous study group of HCC patients. Forty-three tumorous and 45 non-tumorous liver tissue samples from the surgical margin were obtained from HCV-positive, HBV-negative HCC patients who underwent tumor resection surgery and who were monitored for tumor recurrence thereafter (median follow-up time: 16 months (range, 0\u201379 months)). Methylation-specific PCR was used to assess the promoter methylation status of P16(INK4a), SOCS-1, RASSF1A, APC, GSTP1, RIZ1, and MGMT genes, while the level of LINE-1 methylation was used as marker of global DNA methylation levels. Methylation frequencies in P16(INK4a), RASSF1A, APC, GSTP1, and RIZ1 genes were significantly greater in tumorous versus non-tumorous tissues. Methylation of RIZ1 in non-tumorous tissues was significantly associated with time to recurrence. Additionally, genomic DNA was significantly more hypomethylated in tumorous tissues, and this change was associated with shorter recurrence, but not with clinicopathological features. In conclusion, this study supports the role of aberrant methylation in the pathobiology of HCV-positive HCCs. The finding that RIZ1 methylation and increased levels of LINE-1 hypomethylation in non-tumorous tissues are associated with time to recurrence underscores the importance of assessing the epigenetic state of the liver remnant.",

     "abstract": "Rufloxacin (RFX) is an antibacterial fluoroquinolone that exhibits UVA photosensitization properties. Photosensitization reactions lead to the formation of oxidative damage, mainly via singlet oxygen. Here we explore the phototoxic and photomutagenic potency of RFX using a panel of yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) mutants affected in different DNA repair pathways. Yeast mutants provide a sensitive tool to identify the photodamage and the DNA repair pathways that cope with it. Cell viability test at increasing dose of UVA shows that both the DNA repair deficient and wild type cells are equally sensitive to RFX-induced photosensitization, demonstrating that phototoxic effect is not due to DNA injury. Photomutagenicity of RFX is evaluated by measuring the frequency of forward CanR mutations. The mutation induction is low in wild type cells. A high increase in mutation frequency is observed in strains affected in Ogg1 gene, compared to wild type and other base excision repair deficient strains. The mutation spectrum photomediated by RFX in wild type cells reveals a bias in favour of GC\u00a0>\u00a0TA transversions, whereas transition and frameshift mutations are less represented. Altogether data demonstrates that 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) is by far the major DNA damage produced by RFX photosensitization, leading to mutagenesis. We also explore the role played by DNA mismatch repair, translesion synthesis and post-replication repair in the prevention of mutagenic effects due to RFX exposure. In addition, we show that most of RFX photodegradation products are not mutagenic. This study defines the phototoxic and photomutagenic properties of antibacterial RFX and point out possible unwanted side effects in skin under sunlight.",

     "abstract": "Coffee is among the most frequently consumed beverages worldwide and epidemiological studies indicate that its consumption is inversely related to the incidence of diseases in which reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved (liver cirrhosis, certain forms of cancer and neurodegenerative disorders). It has been postulated that antioxidant properties of coffee may account for this phenomenon. To find out if consumption of paper filtered coffee which is the most widely consumed form in Central Europe and the US protects humans against oxidative DNA-damage, a controlled intervention trial with a cross-over design was conducted in which the participants (n\u00a0=\u00a038) consumed 800\u00a0ml coffee or water daily over 5 days. DNA-damage was measured in peripheral lymphocytes in single cell gel electrophoresis assays. The extent of DNA-migration attributable to formation of oxidised purines (formamidopyrimidine glycosylase sensitive sites) was decreased after coffee intake by 12.3% (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Biochemical parameters of the redox status (malondialdehyde, 3-nitrotyrosine and the total antioxidant levels in plasma, glutathione concentrations in blood, intracellular ROS levels and the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in lymphocytes) were not markedly altered at the end of the trial, also the urinary 8-isoprostaglandine F2\u03b1 concentrations were not affected. Overall, the results indicate that coffee consumption prevents endogenous formation of oxidative DNA-damage in human, this observation may be causally related to beneficial health effects of coffee seen in earlier studies.",

Conventional RT dose intensities are limited by adverse responses in normal tissues and a primary goal is to ameliorate adverse normal tissue effects. The aim of these experiments is to further our understanding regarding the mechanism of radioprotection by the DNA minor groove binder, methylproamine, in a cellular context at the DNA level.We used immunocytochemical methods to measure the accumulation of phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) foci following ionizing radiation (IR) in patient-derived lymphoblastoid cells exposed to methylproamine. Furthermore, we performed pulsed field gel electrophoresis DNA damage and repair assays to directly interrogate the action of methylproamine on DNA in irradiated cells.We found that methylproamine-treated cells had fewer \u03b3H2AX foci after IR compared to untreated cells. Also, the presence of methylproamine decreased the amount of lower molecular weight DNA entering the gel as shown by the pulsed field gel electrophoresis assay.These results suggest that methylproamine acts by preventing the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (dsbs) and support the hypothesis that radioprotection by methylproamine is mediated, at least in part, by decreasing initial DNA damage.",

However, the mechanisms for the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin are still not fully understood. Cisplatin primarily targets DNA, resulting in the formation of DNA double strand breaks and eventually causing cell death. In this study, we applied two-dimensional electrophoresis coupled with LC\u2013MS/MS to analyze the nuclear proteome of HeLa cells treated with cisplatin, in an effort to uncover new mechanistic clues regarding the cellular response to cisplatin. A total of 19 proteins were successfully identified, and these proteins are involved in a variety of basal metabolic and biological processes in cells, including biosynthesis, cell cycle, glycolysis and apoptosis. Six were related to the regulation of mRNA splicing, and we therefore asked whether the Fas gene might undergo alternative splicing following cisplatin treatment. This proved to be the case, as the splicing forms of Fas were modified in cisplatin-treated HeLa cells. This work provides novel information, from the perspective of the nuclear response, for understanding the cytotoxicity caused by cisplatin-induced DNA damage.",

In inflamed areas of the liver, etheno adducts were localized in the nuclei of inflammatory cells and in the epithelial lining of the bile duct. Semi-quantitative image analysis showed higher adduct levels in the liver of O. viverrini-infected hamsters, treated with or w/o NDMA when compared with untreated controls. Levels were found highest in the liver of O. viverrini-infected plus NDMA-treated hamsters. Adducts increased in an age-dependent manner from O. viverrini-infection until CCA development. Increased adduct formation paralleled histopathological changes in plasma alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, bile duct hyperplasia, dysplasia, precancerous lesions, and CCA appearance. Also elevated expression of alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG), which excises 1,N6-ethenoadenine (\u025bA) was linked to higher adduct formation, suggesting imbalanced repair.

Since evidence for its chemoprotective properties is restricted to results from in vitro experiments, we monitored the impact of XN on the formation of amino-3-methyl-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoline (IQ)-induced preneoplastic foci in livers and colons of rats (9/group). Additionally, we studied its effects on IQ-induced DNA damage in colonocytes and hepatocytes in single cell gel electrophoresis assays and on the activities of a panel of drug metabolising enzymes. Consumption of the drinking water supplemented with XN (71\u00a0\u03bcg/kg b.w.) before and during carcinogen treatment led to a significant reduction of the number of GST-p+ foci in the liver by 50% and also to a decrease of the foci area by 44%. DNA migration was decreased significantly in both, colon mucosa and liver cells, but no alterations of the activities of different phases I and II enzymes were found in hepatic tissue. Our findings indicate that XN protects against DNA damage and cancer induced by the cooked food mutagen.

     "abstract": "We investigated the photo-mutagenicity and photo-genotoxicity of N-dialkylnitrosamines and its mechanisms of UVA activation. With simultaneous irradiation of UVA, photo-mutagenicity of seven N-dialkylnitrosamines was observed in Ames bacteria (Salmonella typhimurium TA1535) in the absence of metabolic activation. Mutagenicity of pre-irradiated N-dialkylnitrosamines was also observed with S. typhimurium hisG46, TA100, TA102 and YG7108 in the absence of metabolic activation. UVA-mediated mutation with N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) decreased by adding either the NO or OH radical scavenger. When superhelical DNA was irradiated with N-dialkylnitrosamines, nicked circular DNA appeared. Ten N-dialkylnitrosamines examined produced strand breaks in the treated DNA in the presence of UVA. The level of single-strand breaks in \u03d5X174 DNA mediated by N-nitrosomorpholine (NMOR) and UVA decreased by adding either a radical scavenger or superoxide dismutase. When calf thymus DNA was treated with N-dialkylnitrosamines (NDMA, NDEA, NMOR, N-nitrosopyrrolidine (NPYR) and N-nitrosopiperidine (NPIP)) and UVA, the ratio of 8-oxodG/dG in the DNA increased. Action spectra were obtained to determine if nitrosamine acts as a sensitizer of UVA. Both mutation frequency and NO formation were highest at the absorption maximum of nitrosamines, approximately 340\u00a0nm. The plots of NO formation and mutation frequency align with the absorption curve of NPYR, NMOR and NDMA. A significant linear correlation between the optical density of N-dialkynitrosamines at 340\u00a0nm and NO formation in each irradiated solution was revealed by ANOVA. We would like to propose the hypothesis that the N-nitroso moiety of N-dialkylnitrosamines absorbs UVA photons, UVA-photolysis of N-dialkylnitrosamines brings release of nitric oxide, and subsequent production of alkyl radical cations and active oxygen species follow as secondary events, which cause DNA strand breaks, oxidative and alkylative DNA damages and mutation.",

Embryogenic cells exhibited the highest recombination ability with an average of 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125 recombination events per genome, which is about 10-fold of that observed in root cells, and two orders of that observed in leaf cells. Histological analysis revealed that recombination events occurred in diverse cell types, but preferentially in cells with small size. Examples of this included embryogenic cells in callus, phloem cells in the leaf vein, and cells located in the root apical meristem. Steady state RNA analysis revealed that the expression levels of rice Rad51 homologs are positively correlated with increased recombination rates in embryogenic calli, roots and anthers. Finally, radiation treatment of plantlets from distinct recombination lines increased the recombination frequency to different extents. These results showed that homologous recombination frequency can be effectively measured in rice using a transgene reporter assay.

To assess links between increased ROS levels and mutations, we examined in situ levels of ROS and cII mutation frequency, pattern and spectrum in the heart of harlequin (hq)/Big Blue\u00ae mice. The hq mouse is a model of premature aging with mitochondrial dysfunction and increased risk of oxidative stress-induced heart disease with the means for in vivo mutation detection. The hq mutation produces a significant downregulation in the X-linked apoptosis-inducing factor gene (Aif) impairing both the antioxidant and oxidative phosphorylation functions of AIF. Brain and skin of hq disease mice have elevated frequencies of point mutations in nuclear DNA and histopathology characterized by cell loss. Reports of associated elevations in ROS in brain and skin have mixed results. Herein, heart in situ ROS levels were elevated in hq disease compared to AIF-proficient mice (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) yet, mutation frequency and pattern were similar in hq disease, hq carrier and AIF-proficient mice. Heart cII mutations were also assessed 15 days following an acute exposure to an exogenous ROS inducer (10\u00a0mg\u00a0paraquat/kg). Acute paraquat exposure with a short mutant manifestation period was insufficient to elevate mutation frequency or alter mutation pattern in the post-mitotic heart tissue of AIF-proficient mice. Paraquat induction of ROS requires mitochondrial complex I and thus is likely compromised in hq mice. Results of this preliminary survey and the context of recent literature suggest that determining causal links between AIF deficiency and the premature aging phenotypes of specific tissues is better addressed with assay of mitochondrial ROS and large-scale changes in mitochondrial DNA in specific cell types.",

     "abstract": "Inflammation is a necessary part of the immune response. However, when inflammation persists, the resultant state of chronic inflammation may have a number of secondary consequences associated with increased risk of chronic disease. Among these is an increased rate of mutation. There is evidence to suggest that the accumulation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species may be a causal factor in chronic inflammation. These reactive species are also produced through the oxidative burst associated with the inflammatory process, and may interact with various cellular components including proteins, lipids and, most important for mutagenesis, nucleic acids. DNA strand breaks are commonly produced, leading to chromosomal mutation. Oxidized bases, abasic sites, DNA\u2013DNA intrastrand adducts, and DNA\u2013protein cross-links also occur. Not only do the nucleic acid products act directly as pro-mutagenic lesions, lipid peroxidation products may also lead to secondary DNA damage, including pro-mutagenic exocyclic DNA adducts. While frameshift and chromosomal mutations have been associated with chronic inflammation, much of the evidence reveals base pair substitution mutations associated with polymerase stalling near the lesions, and base pair mis-incorporation. There are also indirect effects of ROS/RNS through inhibition of DNA repair enzymes and/or effects on metabolic activation of known carcinogens. Certain disease states, including the Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with enhanced levels of chronic inflammation, and show evidence of enhanced levels of genetic damage in the colonic mucosa. Mutations may provide at least part of the cause of enhanced susceptibility to chronic diseases associated with chronic inflammation.",

The 5\u2032-flanking regions of genes encoding these cytoprotective proteins contain a specific consensus sequence termed antioxidant response element (ARE) to which Nrf2 binds. Recent studies have demonstrated that Nrf2\u2013ARE signaling is also involved in attenuating inflammation-associated pathogenesis, such as autoimmune diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, emphysema, gastritis, colitis and atherosclerosis. Thus, disruption or loss of Nrf2 signaling causes enhanced susceptibility not only to oxidative and electrophilic stresses but also to inflammatory tissue injuries. During the early-phase of inflammation-mediated tissue damage, activation of Nrf2\u2013ARE might inhibit the production or expression of pro-inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, matrix metalloproteinases, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. It is likely that the cytoprotective function of genes targeted by Nrf2 may cooperatively regulate the innate immune response and also repress the induction of pro-inflammatory genes. This review highlights the protective role of Nrf2 in inflammation-mediated disorders with special focus on the inflammatory signaling modulated by this redox-regulated transcription factor.",

In addition, the AD brain shows chronic inflammation characterized by an abundance of reactive astrocytes and activated microglia. In the healthy brain, astrocytes provide essential services for brain homeostasis and neuronal function, including metabolic support for neurons in the form of lactate, glutamate uptake and conversion into glutamine, and synthesis of glutathione and its precursors. In AD, a large body of evidence now suggests that by transforming from a basal to a reactive state, astrocytes neglect their neurosupportive functions, thus rendering neurons vulnerable to neurotoxins including pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species. This review will explain the normal functions of astrocytes, and how these cells might be activated to turn into inflammatory cells, actively contributing to neurodegeneration and neglecting their neurosupportive roles (\u201cneuro-neglect hypothesis\u201d). Furthermore, it is proposed that astrocytes might be promising target of therapeutic intervention for Alzheimer's disease, if these compromised functions can be normalized with pharmacological agents that are specifically designed to return astrocytes to a quiescent phenotype or supplement factors which activated astrocytes lack to produce.",

A special interest has been devoted to the intestine as a source of signals that can amplify local and systemic inflammation. Sentinel cells in the splanchnic area are normally exposed to more than one stimulus at a given time. In the intestine of the elderly, endogenous molecules produced by the cellular aging process and stress as well as exogenous evolutionarily conserved molecules from bacteria, are integrated into a network of receptors and molecular signalling pathways that result in chronic inflammatory activation. It is thus possible that nutritional interventions which modify the intestinal ecology can diminish the pro-inflammatory effects of the microbiota and thereby reinforce the mucosal barrier or modulate the cellular activation pathways.",

The known HDAC inhibitors suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and trichostatin A (TSA) were used as positive controls.

While the benzofurylquinazolines increased the expression level of the pro-inflammatory gene IL1-\u03b1 as well as p21 and p53 in the PC3 cell line, a phenylpyrrolocarbazole had the converse effect on p53 expression.

A family-based genome-wide association study of copy-number variation identified an association between decreased copy-number at TCR\u03b3 and childhood allergic asthma. TCR\u03b3 encodes the T-cell receptor gamma glycoprotein, a cell-surface protein found on T-cells and involved in cell-mediated immunity. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we sought to determine if copy-number variation at TCR\u03b1, TCR\u03b2 or TCR\u03b3 was associated with childhood allergic asthma in an independent cohort of 94 cases and 455 controls using DNA from buccal swabs. Copy-number variation at these loci is well-known, but appears to be dominated by somatic mutations. Genotyping results indicated that copy-number variants at these genes are largely somatic mutations, as inheritance did not show Mendelian consistency. In these mosaic cell populations, copy-number was significantly reduced among asthmatic children at TCR\u03b3 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0199), but was not associated at TCR\u03b1 or TCR\u03b2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.7972 and 0.8585, respectively). These findings support the association between reduced copy-number at TCR\u03b3 and childhood allergic asthma.

Bone loss is directed by various immune mediators such as the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 1-beta or interferon-gamma. Pre-B cell colony enhancing factor (PBEF)/nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT)/visfatin is a pleiotropic mediator acting as growth factor, cytokine and enzyme involved in energy and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism. PBEF/NAMPT/visfatin has been recently demonstrated to exert several pro-inflammatory functions. We studied serum levels of PBEF/NAMPT/visfatin in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) and their relation with bone mineral density (BMD). Furthermore, we were interested whether PBEF/NAMPT/visfatin affects osteoclastogenesis and involved mediators. PBEF/NAMPT/visfatin serum levels were increased in patients with IBD, correlated positively with disease activity and negatively with BMD, especially in the lumbar spine. Osteoclast precursor cells were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells after stimulation with various growth factors such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and soluble ligand of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK). In these in vitro studies, PBEF/NAMPT/visfatin suppressed osteoclastogenesis and inhibited the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase positive multinucleated cells. These effects were paralleled by the suppression of the osteoclast typical markers RANK, nuclear factor of activated T-cells c1 (NFATc1) and cathepsin-K. This is the first report demonstrating a potential role for this important cytokine/enzyme in inflammation-related bone disease.",

It is also involved in modulation of cell proliferation by binding to various growth factors. Based on its known effects in modulating cell proliferation and oxidative stress, APN may potentially be involved in regulating tissue damage and repair following irradiation. Adiponectin KO mice and their WT littermates were exposed to a single whole-body dose of 3 or 6\u00a0Gy gamma radiation. Radiation-induced alterations were studied in jejunum, blood, bone marrow and thymus at days 1 and 5 post-irradiation and compared with sham-irradiated groups. In WT mice, irradiation did not significantly alter serum APN levels while inducing a significant decrease in serum leptin. Irradiation caused a significant reduction in thymocyte cellularity, with concomitant decrease in CD4+, CD8+ and CD4+CD8+ T cell populations, with no significant differences between WT and APN KO mice. Irradiation resulted in a significantly higher increase in the frequency of micronucleated reticulocytes in the blood of APN KO compared with WT mice, whereas frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow at day 5 was significantly higher in WT compared with APN KO mice. Finally, irradiation induced similar alterations in villus height and crypt cell proliferation in the jejunum of WT and APN KO mice. Jejunum explants from sham-irradiated APN KO mice produced higher levels of IL-6 compared with tissue from WT animals, but the difference was no longer apparent following irradiation. Our data indicate that APN deficiency does not play a significant role in modulating radiation-induced gastrointestinal injury in mice, while it may participate in regulation of damage to the hematopoietic system.",

Variant alleles in either gene significantly modified the likelihood of inflammatory disease in a colonic location, and of developing extra-intestinal manifestations. The JAK2 variant also strongly enhanced the risk of ileocolonic disease, with stricturing or ileal/stricturing behaviour, requiring a bowel resection. We further studied a subset of our control population, stratified for JAK2 rs10758669 and/or STAT3 rs3816769 genotype. Carrying either the JAK2 or STAT3 IBD risk allele was associated with significantly enhanced susceptibility to DNA damage, as estimated by comet assays in peripheral blood leukocytes, with or without a subsequent oxidative challenge. That is, both risk alleles enhance genomic instability. The JAK2 SNP is part of a haplotype previously associated with enhanced susceptibility to myeloproliferative neoplasms, but functional consequences of the STAT3 variant had not been previously demonstrated. It will be of interest to follow up CD patients carrying either JAK2 or STAT3 risk alleles for development of further secondary effects, including cancer.",

As well as demographic characteristics, the self-reported questionnaire included (1) smoking and drinking alcohol, (2) breastfeeding in infancy, (3) early life exposures to allergens and microbes, (4) health conditions lasting 6 months or longer and (5) taking antibiotics and any medications. There was strong evidence for familial associations of the disease, and minor effects of birth order and number of siblings. Being a smoker, especially over a long time period, and exposure to smoking during childhood and adolescence periods increased risk, whereas drinking alcohol at least once per week showed a slight protective effect. Long term use of the oral contraceptive pill increased the risk of developing CD, but breastfeeding and immunisation during infancy showed no significant association. Long term and debilitating illness (lasting 6 months or more), taking antibiotics prior to developing CD, or taking four or more antibiotics or any regular medication in a year during adolescence substantially increased the CD risk. Having a pet during childhood was a protective factor, but regularly feeding an animal was not sufficient to protect. Many of these significant factors are likely to impact on the colonic microflora and/or immune system.

Four hundred and forty-six subjects from two different centres in New Zealand were recruited into the study. An extensive dietary questionnaire (257 food items in 15 groups) recorded self-reported dietary tolerances and intolerances. Across each of the food groups, there were statistically significant differences among responses to foods. A two-dimensional graphical summary enabled stratification of foods according to the probability that they will be either beneficial or detrimental. A small number of foods are frequently considered to be beneficial, including white fish, salmon and tuna, gluten-free products, oatmeal, bananas, boiled potatoes, sweet potatoes (kumara), pumpkin, soya milk, goat's milk and yoghurt. Foods that are typically considered detrimental include grapefruit, chilli or chilli sauce, corn and corn products, peanuts, cream, salami, curried foods, cola drinks, high energy drinks, beer, and red wine. For a number of the food items, the same item that was beneficial for one group of subjects was detrimental to others; in particular soya milk, goat's milk, yoghurt, oatmeal, kiwifruit, prunes, apple, broccoli, cauliflower, linseed, pumpkin seed, sunflower seed, ginger and ginger products, beef, lamb, liver, and oily fish. It was not possible to identify a specific group of food items that should be avoided by all CD patients. The wide range of detrimental items suggests that dietary maintenance of remission is likely to be difficult, and to exclude a substantial number of foods.

The binding of interleukin-23 (IL-23) to its receptor IL-23 R regulates a newly defined effector T-cell subset, Th17 cells, characterised by the production of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and other cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). In this study we developed an assay that measured IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 expression after incubation with specific dietary bioactives in the human T-cell Kit 225. It is anticipated that these changes will reflect differences in IL-23 R production, albeit indirectly.The cell line Kit 225 has similarities to Th17 cells, a subset of T cells producing IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1, and in initial experiments we demonstrated that the cells express both IL-23 receptor subunits, as well as IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 genes.Upon verification that stimulation of Kit 225 cells with 1\u00a0ng/mL IL-23 significantly upregulated IL-17 and TNF-\u03b1 gene expression, and IL-17 production, we supplemented cells with selected food bioactives, caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and linoleic acid (LA), and with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) and sodium salicylate, used as pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory controls, respectively.

All studied compounds are capable of inducing chromosome breakage events, as indicated by the enhanced C\u2212MN frequencies. The less lipophilic compounds are the most genetically active molecules. PHE and only two of the studied analogues, AK-409 and AK-433, the most hydrophilic ones, showed aneugenic potential, by increasing the frequencies of MN containing a whole chromosome. The aneugenic potential of the above referred analogues is associated with amplification of centrosome number, since they caused high multipolar metaphase frequencies.",

     "abstract": "The Fanconi anaemia (FA) FANCG protein is an integral component of the FA nuclear core complex that is required for monoubiquitylation of FANCD2. FANCG is also part of another protein complex termed D1-D2-G-X3 that contains FANCD2 and the homologous recombination repair proteins BRCA2 (FANCD1) and XRCC3. Formation of the D1-D2-G-X3 complex is mediated by serine-7 phosphorylation of FANCG and occurs independently of the FA core complex and FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. FANCG contains seven tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) motifs that mediate protein\u2013protein interactions and here we show that mutation of several of the TPR motifs at a conserved consensus residue ablates the in vivo binding activity of FANCG. Expression of mutated TPR1, TPR2, TPR5 and TPR6 in Chinese hamster fancg mutant NM3 fails to functionally complement its hypersensitivities to mitomycin C (MMC) and phleomycin and fails to restore FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. Using co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we demonstrate that these TPR-mutated FANCG proteins fail to interact with BRCA2, XRCC3, FANCA or FANCF. The interactions of other proteins in the D1-D2-G-X3 complex are also absent, including the interaction of BRCA2 with both the monoubiquitylated (FANCD2-L) and non-ubiquitylated (FANCD2-S) isoforms of FANCD2. Interestingly, a mutation of TPR7 (R563E), that complements the MMC and phleomycin hypersensitivity of human FA-G EUFA316 cells, fails to complement NM3, despite the mutated FANCG protein co-precipitating with FANCA, BRCA2 and XRCC3. Whilst interaction of TPR7-mutated FANCG with FANCF does appear to be reduced in NM3, FANCD2 is monoubiquitylated suggesting that sub-optimal interactions of FANCG in the core complex and the D1-D2-G-X3 complex are responsible for the observed MMC- and phleomycin-hypersensitivity, rather than a defect in FANCD2 monoubiquitylation. Our data demonstrate that FANCG functions as a mediator of protein\u2013protein interactions and is vital for the assembly of multi-protein complexes including the FA core complex and the D1-D2-G-X3 complex.",

     "abstract": "During the last decade, there has been clear progress in using threshold in risk assessment but its acceptance by scientists is still under debate. Contrary to indirect DNA-damaging agents, DNA-reactive agents have been assumed to have a non-threshold mode of action, as they directly induce DNA lesions that potentially can be converted into mutations. However, in recent years there is a growing number of data establishing threshold doses even for these DNA-reactive compounds. Indeed, there are several defence and repair mechanisms that provide protection and that may be responsible for genotoxic thresholds. In this context, we recently showed that DNA-oxidizing agents exhibit a thresholded dose\u2013response in vitro with respect to chromosomal alterations. We have hypothesized the involvement of different cellular responses whose nature and efficiency depend on the stress level. The aim of this study was to develop a more complete understanding of these underlying mechanisms. We investigated global gene expression profiles of human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells after exposure to potassium bromate and hydrogen peroxide (via glucose oxidase). Cells were treated for 1\u00a0h and mRNAs were isolated either immediately at the end of the treatment or after a 23-h recovery period. Our results showed that cells have developed elaborate cellular responses to oxidative stress in order to maintain genomic integrity. Many of altered genes were redox-sensitive transcription factors such as p53, NF-\u03baB, AP-1 and Nrf2. Their downstream target genes and signalling pathways were subsequently activated leading mainly to the induction of antioxidant defenses, inflammation, cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and cell death. Overall, our study allowed the identification of key events involved in the thresholded response observed after DNA-oxidizing agents exposure and shows the usefulness of the combination of standard in vitro genotoxicity assays with gene expression profiling technology to determine modes of action, particularly for critical risk assessment.",

The Rad51C protein is one of the five Rad51 paralogs in vertebrates implicated in homologous recombination. A previously described hamster cell mutant defective in Rad51C (CL-V4B) showed increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and displayed genomic instability. Here, we identified a splice donor mutation at position +5 of intron 5 of the Rad51C gene in this mutant, and generated mice harboring an analogous base pair alteration. Rad51Csplice heterozygous animals are viable and do not display any phenotypic abnormalities, however homozygous Rad51Csplice embryos die during early development (E8.5). Detailed analysis of two CL-V4B revertants, V4B-MR1 and V4B-MR2, that have reduced levels of full-length Rad51C transcript when compared to wild type hamster cells, showed increased sensitivity to mitomycin C (MMC) in clonogenic survival, suggesting haploinsufficiency of Rad51C. Similarly, mouse Rad51Csplice/neo heterozygous ES cells also displayed increased MMC sensitivity. Moreover, in both hamster revertants, Rad51C haploinsufficiency gives rise to increased frequencies of spontaneous and MMC-induced chromosomal aberrations, impaired sister chromatid cohesion and reduced cloning efficiency. These results imply that adequate expression of Rad51C in mammalian cells is essential for maintaining genomic stability and sister chromatid cohesion to prevent malignant transformation.",

Recently, SFR has been shown to promote the mitochondrial formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in human cancer cell lines. The present study was undertaken to see whether SFR-derived ROS might cause DNA damage in cultured human cells, namely T limphoblastoid Jurkat and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). 1\u20133\u00a0h treatments with 10\u201330\u00a0\u03bcM SFR elicited intracellular ROS formation (as assayed with dihydrorhodamine, DHR, oxidation) as well as DNA breakage (as assessed with fast halo assay, FHA). These effects lacked cell-type specificity, since could be observed in both Jurkat and HUVEC. Differential-pH FHA analysis of damaged DNA showed that SFR causes frank DNA single strand breaks (SSBs); no DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) were found within the considered treatment times (up to 3\u00a0h). SFR-derived ROS were formed at the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) level: indeed rotenone or myxothiazol (MRC Complex I and III inhibitors, respectively) abrogated ROS formation. Furthermore ROS were not formed in Jurkat cells pharmacologically depleted of respiring mitochondria (MRC\u2212/Jurkat). Formation of ROS was causally linked to the induction of SSBs: indeed all the experimental conditions capable of preventing ROS formation also prevented the damage of nuclear DNA from SFR-intoxicated cells. As to the toxicological relevance of SSBs, we found that their prevention slightly but significantly attenuated SFR cytotoxicity, suggesting that high-dose SFR toxicity is the result of a complex series of events among which GSH depletion seems to play a pivotal role. In conclusion, the present study identifies a novel mechanism contributing to SFR toxicity which \u2013 since DNA damage is a prominent mechanism underlying the cytotoxic activity of established antineoplastic agents \u2013 might help to exploit the therapeutic value of SFR in anticancer drug protocols.",

Symptoms induced by DSP toxins are mainly gastrointestinal, but the intoxication does not appear to be fatal. Despite this, this toxin presents a potential threat to human health even at concentrations too low to induce acute toxicity, since previous animal studies have shown that OA has very potent tumour promoting activity. However, its concrete action mechanism has not been described yet and the results reported with regard to OA cytotoxicity and genotoxicity are often contradictory. In the present study, the genotoxic and cytotoxic effects of OA on three different types of human cells (peripheral blood leukocytes, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells) were evaluated. Cells were treated with a range of OA concentrations in the presence and absence of S9 fraction, and MTT test and Comet assay were performed in order to evaluate cytotoxicity and genotoxicity, respectively. The possible effects of OA on DNA repair were also studied by means of the DNA repair competence assay, using bleomycin as DNA damage inductor. Treatment with OA in absence of S9 fraction induced not statistically significant decrease in cell viability and significant increase in DNA damage in all cell types at the highest concentrations investigated. However, only SHSY5Y cells showed OA induced genotoxic and cytotoxic effects in presence of S9 fraction. Furthermore, we found that OA can induce modulations in DNA repair processes when exposure was performed prior to BLM treatment, in co-exposure, or during the subsequent DNA repair process.",

     "abstract": "Although titanium dioxide (TiO2) has been considered to be biologically inert, finding use in cosmetics, paints and food colorants, recent reports have demonstrated that when TiO2 is attained by UVA radiation oxidative genotoxic and cytotoxic effects are observed in living cells. However, data concerning TiO2\u2013UVB association is poor, even if UVB radiation represents a major environmental carcinogen. Herein, we investigated DNA damage, repair and mutagenesis induced by TiO2 associated with UVB irradiation in vitro and in vivo using Saccharomyces cerevisiae model. It was found that TiO2 plus UVB treatment in plasmid pUC18 generated, in addition to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs), specific damage to guanine residues, such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG) and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG), which are characteristic oxidatively generated lesions. In vivo experiments showed that, although the presence of TiO2 protects yeast cells from UVB cytotoxicity, high mutation frequencies are observed in the wild-type (WT) and in an ogg1 strain (deficient in 8-oxoG and FapyG repair). Indeed, after TiO2 plus UVB treatment, induced mutagenesis was drastically enhanced in ogg1 cells, indicating that mutagenic DNA lesions are repaired by the Ogg1 protein. This effect could be attenuated by the presence of metallic ion chelators: neocuproine or dipyridyl, which partially block oxidatively generated damage occurring via Fenton reactions. Altogether, the results indicate that TiO2 plus UVB potentates UVB oxidatively generated damage to DNA, possibly via Fenton reactions involving the production of DNA base damage, such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine.",

Early and late pachytene and early diplotene spermatocytes that had completed crossing over were sampled. We studied the kinetics of \u03b3-H2AX chromatin foci removal after irradiation of mice deficient for HR and mice deficient for NHEJ. Analyzing \u03b3-H2AX signals in unirradiated RAD54/RAD54B deficient spermatocytes indicated incomplete meiotic recombination repair due to the pronounced increase of \u03b3-H2AX foci in late prophase primary spermatocytes. In these mice, 8\u00a0h after irradiation, early pachytene spermatocytes showed a reduction of the numbers of \u03b3-H2AX foci by 52% compared to 82% in the wild type, the difference being significant. However, after crossing over (in late pachytene and early diplotene), no effect of RAD54/RAD54B deficiency on the reduction of irradiation-induced foci was observed. In NHEJ deficient SCID mice, repair kinetics in early spermatocytes were similar to those in wild type mice. However, 1\u00a0h after irradiation in late pachytene and early diplotene spermatocytes 1.7 times more foci were found than in wild type mice. This difference might be related to the absence of a DNA-PKcs dependent fast repair component in SCID mice. As subsequent repair is normal, HR likely is taking over. Taken together, the results obtained in RAD54/RAD54B deficient mice and in SCID mice indicate that DSB repair in early pachytene spermatocytes is mainly carried out through HR. In late spermatocytes (late pachytenes and early diplotenes) NHEJ is active. However, probably there is an interplay between these repair pathways and when in late spermatocytes the NHEJ pathway is compromised HR may take over.",

We have previously found that AlkB protein induced as part of the adaptive (Ada) response protects cells from the genotoxic and mutagenic activity of MMS. AlkB is a non-heme iron (II), \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that oxidatively demethylates 1meA and 3meC lesions in DNA, with recovery of A and C. Here, we studied the impact of transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) on MMS-induced mutagenesis in E. coli strain deficient in functional AlkB protein. Measuring the decline in the frequency of MMS-induced argE3\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Arg+ revertants under transient amino acid starvation (conditions for TCR induction), we have found a less effective TCR in the BS87 (alkB\u2212) strain in comparison with the AB1157 (alkB+) counterpart. Mutation in the mfd gene encoding the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd, resulted in weaker TCR in MMS-treated and starved AB1157 mfd-1 cells in comparison to AB1157 mfd+, and no repair in BS87 mfd\u2212 cells. Determination of specificity of Arg+ revertants allowed to conclude that MMS-induced 1meA and 3meC lesions, unrepaired in bacteria deficient in AlkB, are the source of mutations. These include AT\u00a0\u2192\u00a0TA transversions by supL suppressor formation (1meA) and GC\u00a0\u2192\u00a0AT transitions by supB or supE(oc) formation (3meC). The repair of these lesions is partly Mfd-dependent in the AB1157 mfd-1 and totally Mfd-dependent in the BS87 mfd-1 strain. The nucleotide sequence of the mfd-1 allele shows that the mutated Mfd-1 protein, deprived of the C-terminal translocase domain, is unable to initiate TCR. It strongly enhances the SOS response in the alkB\u2212mfd\u2212 bacteria but not in the alkB+mfd\u2212 counterpart.",

An in vitro model of human breast epithelial cell transformation was used to study epigenetic changes induced by estradiol during the neoplastic process. Different stages of tumor initiation and progression are represented in this model being MCF-10F the normal stage; trMCF cells, the transformed stage; bsMCF cells, the invasive stage and, caMCF cells, the tumor stage. Global methylation studies by restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) showed an increased DNA methylation during the in the invasive and tumor stages. Expression studies showed that NRG1 (neuregulin 1), CSS3 (chondroitin sulfate synthase 3) and SNIP (SNAP-25-interacting protein) were downregulated in the invasive and tumor cells. The transformed cells showed low expression of STXBP6 (amysin) compared to the parental cells MCF-10F. The treatment of these cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-dC alone or in combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin increased the expression of NRG1, STXBP6, CSS3 and SNIP confirming that DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of the expression of these genes. The NRG1 exon 1 has a region located between \u2212136 and +79 (considering +1, the translational initiation site) rich in CpG sites that was analyzed by methylation specific PCR (MSP). NRG1 exon 1 showed progressive changes in the methylation pattern associated with the progression of the neoplastic process in this model; NRG1 exon 1 was unmethylated in MCF-10F and trMCF cells, becoming hypermethylated in the invasive (bsMCF) and tumor (caMCF) stages. Studies of human breast tissue samples showed that NRG1 exon 1 was partially methylated in 14 out of 17 (82.4%) invasive carcinomas although it was unmethylated in normal tissues (8 out of 10 normal breast tissue samples). Furthermore, NRG1 exon 1 was partially methylated in 9 out of 14 (64.3%) morphologically normal tissue samples adjacent to invasive carcinomas.",

To directly compare responses in spermatozoa with those in progeny, we analyzed cII MFs directly in spermatozoa and in the offspring produced from identical sperm samples of ENU-exposed males. cII MFs in isolated spermatozoa exposed to ENU as post-meiotic germ cells were not significantly elevated, whereas 11\u201330% of the progeny derived from the identically exposed germ cells exhibited significantly elevated cII MFs, \u223c2-fold to >130-fold, compared to controls. The contradictory responses between spermatozoa and progeny analyses can be attributed to induced pre-mutational lesions that remain intact in spermatozoa but were not detected as mutations. Progeny analyses, by contrast, revealed mutant individuals with elevated cII mutant frequencies because persistent DNA damage in the spermatozoa was fixed as mutations in cells of the early stage embryo. Spermatozoa exposed to a mutagen as spermatogonial stem cells can provide an efficient means to detect the portion of transmissible mutations that were fixed as mutations in spermatozoa. The caveat is that direct analyses of mutations in spermatozoa excludes the contribution of mutations that arise from post-fertilization processes in cells of early stage embryos, and therefore may underestimate the actual frequency of mutant offspring.",

In this analysis, we evaluated functional SNPs of three genes of the glutathione-S-transferase (GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTZ1) enzyme family.Participants were 228 presumed fertile men recruited as part of a community-based study. Semen outcome data from this study included total sperm count and concentration, sperm morphology, and sperm DNA integrity and chromatin maturity.

We used multivariable linear regression to assess the relationship between each genotype and sperm outcomes.Overall, our results did not reveal a consistent pattern between GSTM1 and GSTZ genotypes and increased occurrence of adverse sperm outcomes.

In this study we have investigated whether Cr(III), Cr(VI), Co(II) and Cr in combination with Co could induce chromosome aberrations in human fibroblasts in vitro at the same concentrations that have been found in the peripheral blood of exposed humans. We used 24 colour M-FISH as a sensitive way to detect translocations and aneuploidy and examined the effects of a 24-h exposure and its consequences up to 30 days after the exposure in order to record genomic instability and/or repair.At these physiological doses the metals induced predominantly numerical rather than structural aberrations. Co was the least reactive and Cr(VI) especially in combination with Co the most. All metals at the highest physiological doses caused simple (gain or loss of 3 or less chromosomes) and complex (more than 49 chromosomes) aneuploidy. All metals at the lowest physiological dose caused a significant increase of total aberrations. Cr(VI) was much more effective than Cr(III) in causing chromosome fragments, which were only induced at the highest doses. There was a slow resolution of aneuploidy with time after exposure. This involved a reduction in the proportion of aneuploid cells and a reduction of the number of chromosomes within cells showing complex aneuploidy. We conclude that these metal ions can cause chromosome aberrations at physiological concentrations and that their main effect is aneugenic.",

The hypoxia of cyanotic heart disease results in a down-regulation of antioxidant defenses, making cells vulnerable to oxidant damage, which subsequently leads to the single strand breaks and oxidative DNA damage. Quantification of DNA damage was performed in circulating lymphocytes of Tetralogy of Fallot patients (n\u00a0=\u00a063) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a065). The damage of DNA was assessed by alkaline comet assay in lymphocytes isolated from all children followed by silver staining. The DNA migrates out of the nucleus forming a tail, which represents the extent of DNA damage in individual cells. TOF patients exerted a higher percent of comet tails, which are indicative of DNA damage, when compared to control children (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The mean comet tail length was significantly higher in TOF patients (2.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.29) when compared with healthy controls (1.28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32). The results showed that hypoxia is associated with an increase in the level of oxidants and a simultaneous decrease in the level of antioxidants in patients. Hence, the present study concludes unequivocally that hypoxia causes oxidative DNA damage in TOF patients.",

This RAR could be slightly reduced by pifithrin-\u03b1, an inhibitor of P53, however it was completely suppressed by BAY11-7082, an inhibitor of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB). Further assays using western blotting and luciferase reporter gene found that nuclear NF-\u03baB and its activity could be triggered by the priming irradiation of 0.08\u00a0Gy so that the expressions of them in the primed cells were higher than those in the cells exposed to the challenging dose alone. In contrast, LDR neither influenced the expressions of both P53 and phospho-P53 (ser15) nor enhanced P53 activity; the expression of phospho-P53 and the activity of P53 in the primed cells were lower than that in the non-primly challenged cells.

The ROS induced by curcumin in A549 cells was detected by flow cytometry. Using Western blot and RT-PCR, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) decreased in the presence of curcumin. Sp1 is one of the important transcription factors in hTERT expression. Our data showed that curcumin decreases the expression of Sp1 through proteasome pathway. In addition, NAC blunted the Sp1 reduction and hTERT downregulation by curcumin. Further, reporter assay and DNA affinity precipitation assay confirmed the influence of curcumin on Sp1 in hTERT regulation. This is the first study to demonstrate that curcumin induces ROS production resulting in Sp1 binding activity inhibition and hTERT downregulation.",

Although cytochrome c was released from mitochondria as expected, caspase-9 activation was not observed in UV-exposed cells. Laser scanning confocal microscopy analysis showed that caspase-9 is localized in an unusual punctuated pattern in UV-induced apoptotic cells. In agreement with differences in the status of caspase-9 activation between IR and UV, subcellular protein fractionation experiments showed that pro-apoptotic apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 (Apaf-1), normally a part of the apoptosome assembled in response to the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and B-cell lymphoma extra long (Bcl-xL), an inhibitor of the change in mitochondrial membrane permeability, were redistributed by the IR-exposure but not by the UV-exposure. Instead of the sequestration of the capase-9/apoptosome activation in UV-induced apoptotic cells, the extrinsic apoptotic signaling generated by caspase-8 activation and consequent activation of B-cell lymphoma extra long (Bid) to release cytochrome c from mitochondria was observed. Thus, the post-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway downstream of cytochrome c release cannot operate the apoptosome function in UV-induced apoptosis in thymic 3SB cells. The intracellular redistribution and sequestration of apoptosis-related proteins upon mitochondrion-based apoptotic signaling was identified as a novel cellular mechanism to respond to DNA damage in an agent type-specific manner. This finding suggests that the kind of the critical ultimate apoptosis-inducing DNA lesion complex form resulting from the agent-specific DNA damage responses is important to determine which of apoptosis signals would be activated.",

One consequence, radiation-induced genomic instability (RIGI), is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and is often assessed by measuring delayed chromosomal aberrations. We utilised a technique that facilitates transient immobilization of primary lymphocytes for targeted microbeam irradiation and have reported that environmentally relevant doses, e.g. a single 3He2+ particle traversal to a single cell, are sufficient to induce RIGI. Herein we sought to determine differences in radiation response in lymphocytes isolated from five healthy male donors. Primary lymphocytes were irradiated with a single particle per cell nucleus. We found evidence for inter-individual variation in radiation response (RIGI, measured as delayed chromosome aberrations). Although this was not highly significant, it was possibly masked by high levels of intra-individual variation. While there are many studies showing a link between genetic predisposition and RIGI, there are few studies linking genetic background with bystander effects in normal human lymphocytes. In an attempt to investigate inter-individual variation in the induction of bystander effects, primary lymphocytes were irradiated with a single particle under conditions where fractions of the population were traversed. We showed a marked genotype-dependent bystander response in one donor after exposure to 15% of the population. The findings may also be regarded as a radiation-induced genotype-dependent bystander effect triggering an instability phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Over the past 20 or so years experimental evidence, which questions the fundamentals of some 50 years standing, of both biology and radiobiology has accrued. In order to accommodate this new evidence within a framework that encompasses existing knowledge, attention has to be paid to the organisational or epigenetic, features of the cell. In recent years the high dimensional dynamic attractor has emerged as a potential organisational or regulatory agent that represents phenotype. It is argued here that its limited robustness provides a modus operandi to account for stress induced genomic instability.When radiation deposition events act to overcome the robustness of a normal or \u201chome\u201d attractor in the cell of an established species and cause a transition to a variant attractor or phenotype, the consequences are unrelated to any specific molecular damage to the genomic DNA. Rather they correspond to the loss of evolutionarily acquired stability (genotypic replicative integrity) and robustness. Such processes are termed type B events and give rise to a separate category of effects and risk to those associated with the conventional effects of radiation, type A effects. How type B risks might be assessed is discussed.",

     "abstract": "The finding that mammalian cells and tissues and whole organisms react differently at high than at low doses of ionizing radiation questions the scientific validity of the linear no-threshold concept for low-dose exposures. Indeed, the classical paradigm of radiobiology was based on the concept that all radiation effects on living matter are due to the direct action of radiation. Meanwhile, the discovery of non-targeted and delayed radiation effects has challenged this concept, and one might ask whether a new paradigm has to be developed to provide more realistic protection against low radiation doses. The present overview summarizes recent findings on the low-dose radiation-induced bystander effect, genomic instability, radiation hypersensitivity, hormesis, radioadaptive and transgenerational responses. For these, some common features can be recognized.Most of these phenomena include (1) intra- and intercellular signaling, involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). This signaling may be transient or persistent, and may involve the release of cytokines (bystander effect, genomic instability) or epigenetic changes (translesional responses), (2) a large variability of responses depending on the type of radiation, genotype (DNA repair capacity) and physiological state of the cells and tissues. Many more parameters are involved in responses at low doses than at high doses, and different pathways are activated. At low doses, non-linear responses are obtained that are not compatible with the LNT concept. At present, more work is needed to identify the essential parameters involved and to provide a basis for proper modelling of low-dose radiation health effects for radiation protection purposes.",

     "abstract": "The long-standing conventional paradigm for radiobiology has formed a logical basis for the standard paradigm for radiation risk of cancer and heritable effects and, from these paradigms, has developed the internationally applied system for radiation protection, but with many simplifications, assumptions and generalizations. A variety of additional radiobiological phenomena that do not conform to the standard paradigm for radiobiology may have potential implications for radiation risk and radiation protection. It is suggested, however, that the current state of knowledge is still insufficient for these phenomena, individually or collectively, to be formulated systematically into a new paradigm for radiobiology. Additionally, there is at present lack of direct evidence of their relevance to risk for human health, despite attractive hypotheses as to how they might be involved. Finally, it remains to be shown how incorporation of such phenomena into the paradigm for radiation protection would provide sufficient added value to offset disruption to the present widely applied system. Further research should aim for better mechanistic understanding of processes such as radiation-induced genomic instability (for all radiation types) and bystander effects (particularly for low-fluence high-LET particles) and also priority should be given to confirmation, or negation, of the relevance of the processes to human health risks from radiation.",

For most cancer sites the dose\u2013response in these groups is compatible with linearity over the range observed. The available data on biological mechanisms do not provide general support for the idea of a low dose threshold or hormesis. This large body of evidence does not suggest, indeed is not statistically compatible with, any very large threshold in dose for cancer, or with possible hormetic effects, and there is little evidence of the sorts of non-linearity in response implied by non-DNA-targeted effects.There are also excess risks of various types of non-malignant disease in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and in other groups. In particular, elevated risks of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and digestive disease are observed in the A-bomb data. In contrast with cancer, there is much less consistency in the patterns of risk between the various exposed groups; for example, radiation-associated respiratory and digestive diseases have not been seen in these other (non-A-bomb) groups. Cardiovascular risks have been seen in many exposed populations, particularly in medically exposed groups, but in contrast with cancer there is much less consistency in risk between studies: risks per unit dose in epidemiological studies vary over at least two orders of magnitude, possibly a result of confounding and effect modification by well known (but unobserved) risk factors. In the absence of a convincing mechanistic explanation of epidemiological evidence that is, at present, less than persuasive, a cause-and-effect interpretation of the reported statistical associations for cardiovascular disease is unreliable but cannot be excluded. Inflammatory processes are the most likely mechanism by which radiation could modify the atherosclerotic disease process. If there is to be modification by low doses of ionizing radiation of cardiovascular disease through this mechanism, a role for non-DNA-targeted effects cannot be excluded.",

     "abstract": "A well-established radiobiological paradigm is that the biological effects of ionizing radiation occur in irradiated cells as a consequence of the DNA damage they incur. However, many observations of, so-called, non-targeted effects indicate that genetic alterations are not restricted to directly irradiated cells. Non-targeted effects are responses exhibited by non-irradiated cells that are the descendants of irradiated cells (radiation-induced genomic instability) or by cells that have communicated with irradiated cells (radiation-induced bystander effects). Radiation-induced genomic instability is characterized by chromosomal abnormalities, gene mutations and cell death. Similar effects, as well as responses that may be regarded as protective, have been attributed to bystander mechanisms. The majority of studies to date have used in vitro systems but some non-targeted effects have been demonstrated in vivo and there is also evidence for radiation-induced instability in the mammalian germ line. However, there may be situations where radiation-induced genomic instability in vivo may not necessarily identify genomically unstable somatic cells but the manifestation of responses to ongoing production of damaging signals generated by genotype-dependent mechanisms having properties in common with inflammatory processes. Non-targeted mechanisms have significant implications for understanding mechanisms of radiation action but the current state of knowledge does not permit definitive statements about whether these phenomena have implications for assessing radiation risk.",

Second, it is demonstrated that inclusion of a bystander effect with a dose threshold allows an improved description of the lung cancer mortality risk for the Mayak workers cohort due to incorporation of plutonium. The threshold for the annual lung dose is estimated to 12 (90%CI: 4; 14)\u00a0mGy/year. This threshold applies to the initiation of preneoplastic cells and to hyperplastic growth. There is, however, no evidence for a threshold for the effects of gamma radiation.

They are thought to arise from communication between cells through direct cell\u2013cell contacts and via transmissible molecules secreted into the medium by targeted cells.We have investigated medium-mediated damage response in human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) after exposure to ionizing irradiation. We show that HDF experience an elevated level of double stranded DNA damage repair response when incubated with conditioned growth medium of irradiated cells. The magnitude of this response is much lower than observed for directly irradiated cells and is proportional to the radiation dose, as is its persistence across time. Since secretion of cytokines is one of the possible pathways linking targeted and non-targeted cells a multiplex analysis was performed. Four cytokines \u2013 IL6, IL8, MCP-1 and RANTES \u2013 were identified in the growth medium of irradiated cells after exposure to X-rays (2\u00a0Gy). These cytokines were significantly upregulated and each cytokine showed differential upregulation kinetics. Finally we performed a functional analysis to see if IL6 and MCP-1 could induce \u03b3H2AX foci formation. IL6 caused a significant increase in spot occupancy compared to controls. Although only indicative MCP-1 appears to have the opposite effect as it caused a drop in spot occupancy. The combined addition of these two cytokines produced no significant response was observed. Both IL6 and MCP-1 have an effect on the \u03b3H2AX spot occupancy possibly linking these cytokines to the bystander response.",

The most comprehensive data set for tumor induction by heavy ions is the induction of Harderian gland tumors in mice by high-energy protons, helium, neon, iron and niobium ions after doses of 0.05 to several Gy. We report on an analysis of these data that compares a dose response model motivated by the conventional targeted effects (TE) model to one which includes a dose response term descriptive of non-targeted effects (NTE) in cell culture. Results show that a NTE model provides an improved fit to the Harderian gland data over the TE model.

In the Heiligenberger strain, a link between the radiation-induced congenital anomalies and the development of a genomic instability was also suggested. Moreover, further studies showed that in that strain, both congenital anomalies and genomic instability could be transmitted to the next generation. The aim of the experiments described in this paper was to investigate whether such non-targeted transgenerational effects could also be observed in two other radiosensitive mouse strains (CF1 and ICR), using lower radiation doses.Irradiation of the CF1 and ICR female zygotes with 0.2 or 0.4\u00a0Gy did not result in a decrease of their fertility after birth, when they had reached sexual maturity. Moreover, females of both strains that had been X-irradiated with 0.2\u00a0Gy exhibited higher rates of pregnancy, less resorptions and more living fetuses. Additionally, the mean weight of living fetuses in these groups had significantly increased.Exencephaly and dwarfism were observed in CF1 fetuses issued from control and X-irradiated females. In the control group of that strain, polydactyly and limb deformity were also found. The yields of abnormal fetuses did not differ significantly between the control and X-irradiated groups. Polydactyly, exencephaly and dwarfism were observed in fetuses issued from ICR control females. In addition to these anomalies, gastroschisis, curly tail and open eye were observed at low frequencies in ICR fetuses issued from X-irradiated females. Again, the frequencies of abnormal fetuses found in the different groups did not differ significantly.In both CF1 and ICR mouse strains, irradiation of female zygotes did not result in the development of a genomic instability in the next generation embryos.Overall, our results suggest that, at the moderate doses used, developmental defects observed after X-irradiation of female zygotes of these two sensitive mouse strains should not be transmitted to the next generation. Paradoxically, other studies would be needed to address the question of a potential increase of fertility after doses lower than 0.2\u00a0Gy in both strains.",

The position is argued that non-targeted effects are mechanistically important in coordinating phased hierarchical transitions (i.e. transitions which occur in a regulated sequence). The field of multiple stressors (both radiation and chemical) is highly complex and agents can interact in an additive, antagonist or synergistic manner. The outcome following low dose multiple stressor exposure also is impacted by the context in which the stressors are received, perceived or communicated by the organism or tissue. Modern biology has given us very sensitive methods to examine changes following stressor interaction with biological systems at several levels of organization but the translation of these observations to ultimate risk remains difficult to resolve. Since multiple stressor exposure is the norm in the environment, it is essential to move away from single stressor-based protection and to develop tools, including legal instruments, which will enable us to use response-based risk assessment. Radiation protection in the context of multiple stressors includes consideration of humans and non-humans as separate groups requiring separate assessment frameworks. This is because for humans, individual survival and prevention of cancer are paramount but for animals, it is considered sufficient to protect populations and cancer is not of concern. The need to revisit this position is discussed not only from the environmental perspective but also from the human health perspective because the importance of \u201cpollution\u201d (a generic term for multiple environmental stressors) as a cause of non-cancer disease is increasingly being recognized. Finally a way forward involving experimental assessment of biomarker performance to lead to a theoretical framework allowing modeling is suggested.",

     "abstract": "It is well established that moderate to high doses of radiation can increase the occurrence also of a variety of non-cancer effects in exposed individuals, but for radiation protection purposes it has generally been assumed that there is a threshold of dose below which no significant non-cancer effects (apart from hereditary disease) arise.In recent years, there is growing epidemiological evidence of excess risk of late occurring cardiovascular disease at much lower radiation doses and occurring over much longer intervals after radiation exposure without a clear cut threshold. However, the epidemiological evidence available so far for non-cancer health effects after exposure to moderate or low radiation doses is suggestive rather than persuasive.The mechanisms of radiation-induced vascular disease induction are far away from being understood. However, it seems to be very likely that inflammatory responses are involved. Recent experimental studies by Stewart et al. [25] could demonstrate that high dose exposure to the cardiovascular system is associated with an earlier onset and accelerated development of macrophage-rich, inflammatory atherosclerotic lesions prone to intra-plaque hemorrhage and may also cause a decrease in myocardial perfusion. Both, macro-vascular and micro-vascular radiation effects involve the endothelium and pro-inflammatory signalling cascades. If modulation of inflammatory response is arguably also the most likely cause of radiation-induced cardiovascular disease after low dose exposure, this also implies a role for non-targeted radiation effects.In the absence of a convincing mechanistic explanation of the currently available epidemiological evidence for radiation-induced cardiovascular risk at low radiation doses, caution is required in the interpretation of the statistical associations. On the other hand, the possibility of such a causal explanation cannot be reliably excluded. Further epidemiological and biological evidence from currently ongoing research projects will allow a firmer conclusion to be drawn.",

Although convenient for biochemical analysis, the true interactions in vivo depend upon complex interactions between cells themselves and the surrounding extracellular matrix. This study directly compares the influence of culture conditions on radiation induced cytotoxicity following exposure to low-LET ionizing radiation. Using a three-dimensional (3D) human mammary epithelial tissue model, we have found a protective effect of 3D cell culture on cell survival after irradiation. The initial state of the cells (i.e., 2D versus 3D culture) at the time of irradiation does not alter survival, nor does the presence of extracellular matrix during and after exposure to dose, but long term culture in 3D which offers significant reduction in cytotoxicity at a given dose (e.g. \u223c4-fold increased survival at 5\u00a0Gy). The cell cycle delay induced following exposure to 2 and 5\u00a0Gy was almost identical between 2D and 3D culture conditions and cannot account for the observed differences in radiation responses. However the amount of apoptosis following radiation exposure is significantly decreased in 3D culture relative to the 2D monolayer after the same dose. A likely mechanism of the cytoprotective effect afforded by 3D culture conditions is the down regulation of radiation induced apoptosis in 3D structures.",

The issue of appropriate terminology for the new effects is discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on the inheritance of genomic instability, where there are issues concerning which effects should be considered as transgenerational. Finally, in respect of the question as to whether these new effects are likely to have an impact on human health is addressed. It is concluded that there is a need for a clearer terminology to facilitate research progress, that real health effects cannot be ruled out and that therefore there is a need for new paradigms not only for radiobiology but also for risk assessment and radiological protection.",

However, historically, the mutation rate (\u03bc) has been difficult to measure directly, and increased cell turnover or selection could provide an alternative explanation. We recently developed an assay for \u03bc using PIG-A as a sentinel gene and estimated that its average value is 10.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127 mutations per cell division in B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (BLCLs) from normal donors. Here we have measured \u03bc in human malignancies and found that it was elevated in cell lines derived from T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma in transformed phase, and 2 plasma cell neoplasms. In contrast, \u03bc was much lower in a marginal zone lymphoma cell line and 5 other plasma cell neoplasms. The highest \u03bc value that we measured, 3286\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127, is 2 orders of magnitude above the range we have observed in non-malignant human cells. We conclude that the type of genomic instability detected in this assay is a common but not universal feature of hematologic malignancies.",

G\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T transversions occurred at a frequency of 10% (12/125), which is less than reported in mutation databases for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (24%). Characteristically, in our SNC series, the mutations were scattered over a large number of codons, codon 248 being the most frequent target of base substitution. Codon 135 was the second most frequently mutated codon; this nucleotide position has not been reported before as frequently mutated in head and neck cancer or human cancer in general.

     "abstract": "Many studies have examined bystander effects induced by ionizing radiation, however few have evaluated the ability of chemicals to induce similar effects. We previously reported the ability of two chemicals, mitomycin C (MMC) and phleomycin (PHL) to induce bystander effects in normal human lymphoblastoid cell lines. The focus of the current study was to determine the involvement of the MAPK proteins in bystander effects induced by physical and chemical DNA damaging agents and to evaluate the effects of MAPK inhibition on bystander-induced caspase 3/7 activation. The phosphorylation levels of the MAPK proteins ERK1/2, JNK, and p38, were measured from 1 to 24\u00a0h following direct or bystander exposure to MMC, PHL or radiation. We observed transient phosphorylation, at early time points, of all 3 proteins in bystander cells. We also evaluated the effect of MAPK inhibition on bystander-induced caspase 3/7 activity to determine the role of MAPK proteins in bystander-induced apoptosis. We observed bystander-induced activation of caspase 3/7 in bystander cells. Inhibition of MAPK proteins resulted in a decrease in caspase 3/7 activity at the early time points, and the caspase activity increased (in the case of ERK inhibition) or returned to basal levels (in the case of JNK or p38 inhibition) between 12 and 24\u00a0h. PHL is considered to be a radiomimetic agent, however in the present study PHL behaved more like a chemical and not like radiation in terms of MAPK phosphorylation. These results point to the involvement of MAPK proteins in the bystander effect induced by radiation and chemicals and provide additional evidence that this response is not limited to radiation but is a generalized stress response in cells.",

Although frequent loss of heterozygosity around the Pten locus and plausible involvement of epigenetic silencing have been reported in radiation-induced thymic lymphomas, the proportion of lymphomas with inactivated Pten and the spectrum of causal aberrations have not been extensively characterized. Here, we assessed the mode of Pten inactivation by comprehensive analysis of the expression and alteration of Pten in 23 radiation-induced thymic lymphomas developed in B6C3F1 mice. We found no evidence for methylation-associated silencing of Pten; rather, complex structural abnormalities comprised of missense and nonsense mutations, 1- and 3-bp insertions, and focal deletions were identified in 8 of 23 lymphomas (35%). Sequencing of deletion breakpoints suggested that aberrant V(D)J recombination and microhomology-mediated rearrangement were responsible for the focal deletions. Seven of the 8 lymphomas had biallelic alterations, and 4 of them did not express Pten protein. These Pten aberrations coincided with downstream Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, we demonstrate that Pten inactivation is frequently biallelic and is caused by a variety of structural abnormalities (rather than by epigenetic silencing) and is involved in radiation-induced lymphomagenesis.",

     "abstract": "The instability of common fragile sites (CFSs) contributes to the development of a variety of cancers. The ATR-dependent DNA damage checkpoint pathway has been implicated in maintaining CFS stability, but the mechanism is incompletely understood. The goal of our study was to elucidate the action of the ATR protein in the CFS-specific ATR-dependent checkpoint response. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we demonstrated that ATR protein preferentially binds (directly or through complexes) to fragile site FRA3B as compared to non-fragile site regions, under conditions of mild replication stress. Interestingly, the amount of ATR protein that bound to three regions of FRA3B peaked at 0.4\u00a0\u03bcM aphidicolin (APH) treatment and decreased again at higher concentrations of APH. The total amounts of cellular ATR and several ATR-interacting proteins remained unchanged, suggesting that ATR binding to the fragile site is guided initially by the level of replication stress signals generated at FRA3B due to APH treatment and then sequestered from FRA3B regions by successive signals from other non-fragile site regions, which are produced at the higher concentrations of APH. This decrease in ATR binding to fragile site FRA3B at the higher concentrations of APH may account for the increasing number of chromosome gaps and breaks observed under the same conditions. Furthermore, inhibition of ATR kinase activity by treatment with 2-aminopurine (2-AP) or by over-expression of a kinase-dead ATR mutant showed that the kinase activity is required for the binding of ATR to fragile DNAs in response to APH treatment. Our results provide novel insight into the mechanism for the regulation of fragile site stability by ATR.",

In the present study, using a similar approach, we examined the nuclear protein response to BaP in HeLa cells and found that BaP treatment caused expression changes in many nuclear proteins. Twenty-four of these proteins were successfully identified, several of which are involved in the alternative splicing of mRNA, DNA replication, recombination, and repair. The changed expression levels were further confirmed by immunoblot analysis using specific antibodies for two proteins, Lamin A and mitotic checkpoint protein Bub3. The nuclear localization of these two proteins was also confirmed by confocal microscopy. To determine whether alternative splicing was activated following BaP treatment, we examined Fas and CD44, two genes previously shown to be targets of alternative splicing in respond to DNA damage. While no significant activation of alternative splicing was observed for Fas, CD44 splicing variants were found after BaP treatment. Together, these data show that DNA damage induces dramatic changes in nuclear protein expression, and that alternative splicing might be involved in the cellular response to DNA damage.",

DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol \u03b2) knockout (KO) MEFs are hypersensitive to the cytotoxic effect of alkylating agents, as compared to WT MEFs. To test the hypothesis that Parp1 is preferentially activated by methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) exposure of Pol \u03b2 KO MEFs, we have examined the relationship between Pol \u03b2 expression, Parp1 activation and cell survival following MMS exposure in a series of WT and Pol \u03b2 deficient MEF cell lines. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed elevated Parp1 activation in Pol \u03b2 KO MEFs as compared to matched WT MEFs. Both the MMS-induced activation of Parp1 and the MMS-induced cytotoxicity of Pol \u03b2 KO MEFs are attenuated by pre-treatment with the Parp1/Parp2 inhibitor PJ34. Further, elevated Parp1 activation is observed following knockdown (KD) of endogenous Pol \u03b2, as compared to WT cells. Pol \u03b2 KD MEFs are hypersensitive to MMS and both the MMS-induced hypersensitivity and Parp1 activation is prevented by pre-treatment with PJ34. In addition, the MMS-induced cellular sensitivity of Pol \u03b2 KO MEFs is reversed when Parp1 is also deleted (Pol \u03b2/Parp1 double KO MEFs) and we observe no MMS sensitivity differential between Pol \u03b2/Parp1 double KO MEFs and those that express recombinant mouse Pol \u03b2. These studies suggest that Parp1 may function as a sensor of BER to initiate cell death when BER is aborted or fails. Parp1 may therefore function in BER as a tumor suppressor by initiating cell death and preventing the accumulation of cells with chromosomal damage due to a BER defect.",

Mutational status of all mutations was confirmed using germline DNA extracted from peripheral blood. Consistent with the literature data, no other mutations regarding the rest of the genes of the panel were identified.

     "abstract": "The 22q11.2 region is a hotspot for chromosomal rearrangements mediated by LCR22A-D low-copy repeats. Sequence motifs and homology-driven mechanisms have been suggested to mediate rearrangements. Nevertheless, recent evidence has emphasized the role of functional properties in genome instability, suggesting that replication timing transition regions could be peculiarly prone to genetic damage. In this work, we show that an early-late replication-transition zone is localised within LCR22A, the shared proximal endpoint of the majority of deletions and duplications of 22q11.2 region. Transition zone is characterized by asynchronous replication and by a DNA flexibility peak, features which are relevant for double-strand breaks and rearrangements at fragile sites. This and other flexibility peaks, associated with less relevant replication anomalies, are present in clusters inside LCR22A, B and D. All of them are composed of modules of AT-rich sequences, DNA satellites, and a HIV-1 integration site; moreover, they have coincidental position with boundaries of duplicons inside segmental duplications and with breakpoints of recurrent translocations. Noteworthy, flexibility peaks also lay at breakpoints of translocation partner chromosomes, three of which, 1p21.2, 8q24.13 and 11q23.3, have been positioned inside known common fragile sites. In many cases peaks are associated with potential matrix attachment regions (MARs). We propose that, similarly to fragile sites, replication perturbation and flexibility peaks may mediate strand breakage and rearrangements. Consistently with this view we show that the replication timing transition zone detected inside LCR22A is susceptible to replicative stress by aphidicolin, known inducer of fragile sites. These findings emphasize the significance of mutagenic exposure for the constitutional syndrome origin.",

     "abstract": "Previous work in our laboratory established that a spontaneous mutagenesis process operating in stationary-phase Escherichia coli cells undergoing selection is subject to regulation by the global regulatory mechanism known as catabolite repression (formerly also called glucose-repression). Here, we set out to determine the identity of this hitherto unknown catabolite-repressible spontaneous mutation generation mechanism(s). We used two different spontaneous mutation detection assays, reversion of a Lac\u2212 (lacI33\u03a9lacZ) frameshift marker and forward mutation to valine-resistance, and tested the effects of varying the nature of the carbon source(s) present in the selective plating medium on the mutability of bacterial cells carrying known defects in the recA, umuDC and dinB genes, three well-known SOS response genes, whose products are important for mutagenesis in E. coli. Consistent with the results of our previous Lac\u2212\u00a0\u2192\u00a0Lac+ assay using otherwise SOS-proficient bacterial cells, we found that the overall numbers of spontaneous Lac+E. coli revertants were highest when the selective medium contained lactose and lowest when it contained lactose plus the non-utilizable but strongly catabolite-repressing glucose analogue, methyl-\u03b1-d-glucopyranoside (\u03b1MG). In contrast, we found that the numbers of Lac+ revertants appearing on the lactose and lactose\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b1MG selection plates were greatly diminished and not significantly different when the bacterial cells concerned carried either a \u0394recA or \u0394dinB mutation. Furthermore, introducing the \u0394dinB mutant allele into bacterial cells over-expressing the recA gene reduced the numbers of Lac+ mutations to those being recovered with the \u0394dinB cells. These results appear to suggest that (i) the DinB-dependent mutation generation pathway is alone responsible for spontaneous reversion of the lacI33\u03a9lacZ frameshift marker, and (ii) the varying numbers of Lac+ colonies that we recover on the lactose and lactose\u00a0+\u00a0\u03b1MG plates provide a direct measure of the differential effects of these particular carbon compounds on the overall expression of the dinB gene. Interestingly, the yields of spontaneous ValR mutations arising in wild-type, \u0394recA, \u0394dinB and \u0394umuDC cells were found to be similar, but always tended to be highest when the medium contained only a non-repressing carbon source (glycerol) and lowest when it had been supplemented with a strong catabolite repressor such as glucose or \u03b1MG. Together, our results would seem to establish that stationary-phase E. coli cells exposed to strong selection pressures can accumulate spontaneous mutations via SOS-dependent and SOS-independent mutation generation pathways whose levels of expression are regulated by catabolite repression.",

     "abstract": "Uracil appears in DNA as a result of cytosine deamination and by incorporation from the dUTP pool. As potentially mutagenic and deleterious for cell regulation, uracil must be removed from DNA. The major pathway of its repair is initiated by uracil-DNA glycosylases (UNG), ubiquitously found enzymes that hydrolyze the N-glycosidic bond of deoxyuridine in DNA. This review describes the current understanding of the mechanism of uracil search and recognition by UNG. The structure of UNG proteins from several species has been solved, revealing a specific uracil-binding pocket located in a DNA-binding groove. DNA in the complex with UNG is highly distorted to allow the extrahelical recognition of uracil. Thermodynamic studies suggest that UNG binds with appreciable affinity to any DNA, mainly due to the interactions with the charged backbone. The increase in the affinity for damaged DNA is insufficient to account for the exquisite specificity of UNG for uracil. This specificity is likely to result from multistep lesion recognition process, in which normal bases are rejected at one or several pre-excision stages of enzyme\u2013substrate complex isomerization, and only uracil can proceed to enter the active site in a catalytically competent conformation. Search for the lesion by UNG involves random sliding along DNA alternating with dissociation\u2013association events and partial eversion of undamaged bases for initial sampling.",

     "abstract": "The recognition and subsequent repair of DNA damage are essential reactions for the maintenance of genome stability. A key general sensor of DNA lesions is xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein, which recognizes a wide variety of helix-distorting DNA adducts arising from ultraviolet (UV) radiation, genotoxic chemicals and reactive metabolic byproducts. By detecting damaged DNA sites, this unique molecular sensor initiates the global genome repair (GGR) pathway, which allows for the removal of all the aforementioned lesions by a limited repertoire of excision factors. A faulty GGR activity causes the accumulation of DNA adducts leading to mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, neurological degeneration and other traits of premature aging. Recent findings indicate that XPC protein achieves its extraordinary substrate versatility by an entirely indirect readout strategy implemented in two clearly discernible stages. First, the XPC subunit uses a dynamic sensor interface to monitor the double helix for the presence of non-hydrogen-bonded bases. This initial screening generates a transient nucleoprotein intermediate that subsequently matures into the ultimate recognition complex by trapping undamaged nucleotides in the abnormally oscillating native strand, in a way that no direct contacts are made between XPC protein and the offending lesion itself. It remains to be elucidated how accessory factors like Rad23B, centrin-2 or the UV-damaged DNA-binding complex contribute to this dynamic two-stage quality control process.",

There is increasing evidence that the mutagenic potential of Cd is not restricted to the induction of DNA lesions. Cd has been shown to inactivate several DNA repair enzymes. Here we show that exposure of human cells to sub-lethal concentrations of Cd leads to a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in hOGG1 activity, the major DNA glycosylase activity responsible for the initiation of the base excision repair (BER) of 8-oxoguanine, an abundant and mutagenic form of oxidized guanine. Although there is a slight effect on the level of hOGG1 transcripts, we show that the inhibition of the 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase activity is mainly associated with an oxidation of the hOGG1 protein and its disappearance from the soluble fraction of total cell extracts. Confocal microscopy analyses show that in cells exposed to Cd hOGG1-GFP is recruited to discrete structures in the cytoplasm. These structures were identified as stress granules. Removal of Cd from the medium allows the recovery of the DNA glycosylase activity and the presence of hOGG1 in a soluble form. In contrast to hOGG1, we show here that exposure to Cd does not affect the activity of the second enzyme of the pathway, the major AP endonuclease APE1.",

     "abstract": "Aerobic respiration generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product of cellular metabolism which can damage DNA. The complex nature of oxidative DNA damage requires actions of several repair pathways. Oxidized DNA bases are substrates for two overlapping pathways: base excision repair (BER) and nucleotide incision repair (NIR). In the BER pathway a DNA glycosylase cleaves the N-glycosylic bond between the abnormal base and deoxyribose, leaving either an abasic site or single-stranded DNA break. Alternatively, in the NIR pathway, an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease incises duplex DNA 5\u2032 next to oxidatively damaged nucleotide. The multifunctional Escherichia coli endonuclease IV (Nfo) is involved in both BER and NIR pathways. Nfo incises duplex DNA 5\u2032 of a damaged residue but also possesses an intrinsic 3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u2032 exonuclease activity. Herein, we demonstrate that Nfo-catalyzed NIR and exonuclease activities can generate a single-strand gap at the 5\u2032 side of 5,6-dihydrouracil residue. Furthermore, we show that Nfo mutants carrying amino acid substitutions H69A and G149D are deficient in both NIR and exonuclease activities, suggesting that these two functions are genetically linked and governed by the same amino acid residues. The crystal structure of Nfo-H69A mutant reveals the loss of one of the active site zinc atoms (Zn1) and rearrangements of the catalytic site, but no gross changes in the overall enzyme conformation. We hypothesize that these minor changes strongly affect the DNA binding of Nfo. Decreased affinity may lead to a different kinking angle of the DNA helix and this in turn thwart nucleotide incision and exonuclease activities of Nfo mutants but to lesser extent of their AP endonuclease function. Based on the biochemical and genetic data we propose a model where nucleotide incision coupled to 3\u2032\u00a0\u2192\u00a05\u2032 exonuclease activity prevents formation of lethal double-strand breaks when repairing bi-stranded clustered DNA damage.",

     "abstract": "Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase 1 (PARP1), functioning as DNA nick-sensor, interacts with base excision repair (BER) DNA intermediates containing single-strand breaks. When bound to DNA breaks, PARP1 catalyzes synthesis of poly(ADP-ribose) covalently attached to itself and some nuclear proteins. Autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP1 facilitates its dissociation from DNA breaks and is considered as a factor regulating DNA repair. In the study, using system reconstituted from purified BER proteins, bovine testis nuclear extract and model BER DNA intermediates, we examined the influence of PARP1 and its autopoly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on DNA polymerase \u03b2 (Pol \u03b2)-mediated long patch (LP) BER DNA synthesis that is accomplished through a cooperation between Pol \u03b2 and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease1 (APE1) or flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) and gap-filling activity of Pol \u03b2. PARP1 upon interaction with nicked LP BER DNA intermediated, formed after gap-filling, was shown to suppress the subsequent steps in LP pathway. PARP1 interferes with APE1-dependent stimulation of DNA synthesis by Pol \u03b2 via strand-displacement mechanism. PARP1 also represses Pol \u03b2/FEN1-mediated LP BER DNA synthesis via a \u201cgap translation\u201d mechanism inhibiting FEN1 activity on the nicked DNA intermediate. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP1 abolishes its inhibitory influence on LP BER DNA synthesis catalyzed by Pol \u03b2 both via APE1-mediated strand-displacement and FEN1-mediated \u201cgap translation\u201d mechanism. Thus PARP1 may act as a negative regulator of Pol \u03b2 activity in LP BER pathway and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP1 seems to play a critical role in enablement of Pol \u03b2-mediated DNA synthesis in this process. In contrast, interaction of PARP1 with one nucleotide gapped DNA mimicking the intermediate of short patch (SP) BER slightly inhibits the gap-filling activity of Pol \u03b2 and the overall efficiency of SP BER is practically unaffected by PARP1. Thus, PARP1 differentially influences DNA synthesis in SP- and LP BER pathways.",

     "abstract": "Prominent lesions in DNA are abasic (AP) sites arising spontaneously or as intermediates during base excision repair. An AP site can form a Schiff base intermediate with primary amino groups of proteins. This intermediate can be stabilized by NaBH4 treatment and, therefore, cross-linking of AP site-containing DNA (AP DNA) can be used as a tool in detecting proteins that interact with AP sites. Using AP DNA, we observed in the extracts derived from several human cell lines a predominant cross-linked product with an apparent molecular mass of 95\u00a0kDa. The cross-linked protein was identified as the p80 subunit of Ku antigen (Ku80) (Ilina et al., Biochem. Biophys. Acta 1784 (2008) 1777\u20131785 [1]). Because the cross-linking of Ku80 to AP sites is efficient and selective, this approach may be useful to estimate the amount of Ku antigen in cell extracts in the presence of other cellular proteins. We compared levels of Ku80 detected by dot-ELISA with Ku80 antibodies to the levels of Ku80 cross-linked to AP DNA in extracts derived from HeLa cells and several melanoma cell lines. The level of Ku80 trapping varied considerably depending on the cell lines and correlated with the amount of Ku80 in the extracts estimated by the immunochemical approach. This approach, unlike western blot or estimation of the Ku content based on mRNA levels, is more suitable for tracking Ku forms active in DNA binding including those having aberrations in Ku80, but retaining an ability to heterodimerize with Ku70, that provides efficient loading of Ku antigen onto DNA ends. As a routine test, borohydride trapping (BHT) is also less time and reagent consuming than blotting and EMSA.",

GCV and CdG elicited similar cytotoxicity at low concentrations, whereas PCV was 10\u2013100-fold less cytotoxic in human tumor cells. DNA replication fidelity was evaluated using a supF plasmid-based mutation assay. Only GCV induced a dose-dependent increase in mutation frequency, predominantly GC\u2192TA transversions, which contributed to cytotoxicity and implicated the ether oxygen in mutagenicity. Activation of mismatch repair with hydroxyurea decreased mutations but failed to repair the GC\u2192TA transversions. GCV slowed S-phase progression and CdG also induced a G2/M block, but both drugs allowed completion of one cell cycle after drug treatment followed by cell death in the second cell cycle. In contrast, PCV induced a lengthy early S-phase block due to profound suppression of DNA synthesis, with cell death in the first cell cycle after drug treatment. These data suggest that GCV and CdG elicit superior cytotoxicity due to their effects in template DNA, whereas strong inhibition of nascent strand synthesis by PCV may protect against cytotoxicity. Nucleoside analogs based on the carbohydrate structures of GCV and CdG is a promising area for antitumor drug development.",

In the present work we have characterised the effects of 3-NBA and its metabolite 3-aminobenzanthrone (3-ABA) on cell death and cytokine release in mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells. These effects were related to induced DNA damage and changes in cell signalling pathways. 3-NBA resulted in cell death and caused most DNA damage as judged by the amount of DNA adducts (32P-postlabelling assay), single strand (ss)DNA breaks and oxidative DNA lesions (comet assay) detected. An increased phosphorylation of H2AX, chk1, chk2 and partly ATM was observed using flow cytometry and/or Western blotting. Both compounds increased phosphorylation of p53 and MAPKs (ERK, p38 and JNK). However, only 3-NBA caused an accumulation of p53 in the nucleus and a translocation of Bax to the mitochondria. The p53 inhibitor pifithrin-alpha inhibited 3-NBA-induced apoptosis, indicating that cell death was a result of the triggering of DNA signalling pathways. The highest phosphorylation of Akt and degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 (suggesting activation of NF-\u03baB) were also seen after treatment with 3-NBA. In contrast 3-ABA increased IL-6 release, but caused little or no toxicity. Cytokine release was inhibited by PD98059 and curcumin, suggesting that ERK and NF-\u03baB play a role in this process.

The test system used involved pIF102 and pIF104 plasmids bearing the lactose operon of CC102 or CC104 origin (Cupples and Miller (1989) [17]) which allowed to monitor Lac+ revertants, the latter arose by GC\u00a0\u2192\u00a0AT or GC\u00a0\u2192\u00a0TA substitutions, respectively, as a result of modification of guanine and cytosine. The plasmids were CAA-damaged in vitro and replicated in Escherichia coli of various genetic backgrounds. To modify the levels of AlkA and AlkB proteins, mutagenesis was studied in E. coli cells induced or not in adaptive response. Formation of \u025bC proceeds via a relatively stable intermediate, 3,N4-\u03b1-hydroxyethanocytosine (HEC), which allowed to compare repair of both adducts. The results indicate that all three genes, alkA, alkB and mug, are engaged in alleviation of CAA-induced mutagenesis. The frequency of mutation was higher in AlkA-, AlkB- and Mug-deficient strains in comparison to alkA+, alkB+, and mug+ controls. Considering the levels of CAA-induced Lac+ revertants in strains harboring the pIF plasmids and induced or not in adaptive response, we conclude that AlkB protein is engaged in the repair of \u025bC and HEC in vivo. Using the modified TTCTT 5-mers as substrates, we confirmed in vitro that AlkB protein repairs \u025bC and HEC although far less efficiently than the reference adduct 3-methylcytosine. The pH optimum for repair of HEC and \u025bC is significantly different from that for 3-methylcytosine. We propose that the protonated form of adduct interact in active site of AlkB protein.",

     "abstract": "The primary function of O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) is to maintain genomic integrity in the face of damage by both endogenous and exogenous alkylating agents. However, paradoxically, bacterial and mammalian AGTs have been shown to increase cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of dihaloalkanes and other bis-electrophiles when expressed in bacterial cells. We have extended these studies to mammalian cells using CHO cells that lack AGT expression and CHO cells stably transfected with a plasmid that expresses human AGT. The cytotoxicity of 1,2-dibromoethane, dibromomethane and epibromohydrin was significantly increased by the presence of AGT but cytotoxicity of butadiene diepoxide was not affected. Mutations caused by these agents were assessed using hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) as a reporter gene. There was a small (c. 2\u20133-fold) but statistically significant AGT-mediated increase in mutations caused by 1,2-dibromoethane, dibromomethane and epibromohydrin. Analysis of the mutation spectrum induced by 1,2-dibromoethane showed that the presence of AGT also altered the types of mutations with an increase in total base substitution mutants due to a rise in transversions at both G:C and A:T sites. AGT expression also led to mutations arising from the transcribed strand, which were not seen in cells lacking AGT. Although the frequency of deletion mutations was decreased by AGT expression, the formation of large deletions (\u22653 exons) was increased. This work demonstrates that interaction of AGT with some bis-electrophiles can cause mutagenicity and diminished cell survival in mammalian cells. It is consistent with the hypothesis that DNA\u2013AGT cross-links, which have been characterized in experiments with purified AGT protein and such bis-electrophiles, can be formed in mammalian cells.",

Cases with the PM genotypes of CYP2D6 displayed a significantly increased risk for HNSCC as compared to wild type genotypes. The risk was found to further increase in cases (up to 4.8) carrying combination of PM genotypes of CYP2D6, CYP2C9 (CYP2C9*2) or CYP2C19 (CYP2C19*2), suggesting that synergism amongst the PM genotypes of drug metabolizing CYPs leads to impairment in the detoxification of the tobacco carcinogens. A small increase in the risk in tobacco (chewers or smokers) or alcohol users in cases with CYP2D6*4 allele while no change or even a small decrease in risk in cases with CYP2D6*10 allele when compared to non-tobacco or alcohol users have suggested that CYP2D6 genotypes alone do not appear to interact significantly with environmental risk factors in modifying the susceptibility to HNSCC. Furthermore, most of the cases carrying PM genotypes of CYP2D6 did not respond to the treatment. Moreover, higher prevalence of non-responders among cases carrying combination of CYP2D6*4 or CYP2D6*4, CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C19*2 have demonstrated that interaction of PM genotypes may not only significantly modify the susceptibility to HNSCC but also the treatment response.",

This study demonstrates the importance of a highly conserved flexible loop found in Escherichia coli MutS (residues 658\u2013670) in DNA mismatch repair. This loop is speculated to be analogous to the ABC signature motif of drug transporters based on its proximity to the ATP catalytic site in crystal structures. Our studies show that amino acid residues G666 and S668 control MutS functions subsequent to mismatch recognition by MutS, i.e., nucleotide-mediated exchange and ATP-dependent dissociation from mismatch. G666V mutation affects mismatch-provoked ADP\u2013ATP exchange and results in slower dissociation kinetics of MutS from the mismatch while S668A mutation affects stable clamp formation and dissociation kinetics but does not affect nucleotide exchange. Both mutants harbor defects in ATP hydrolysis and cause a significant mutator phenotype in vivo. The mutator effect of S668A is indistinguishable from that of a MutS-deficient background and is similar to that seen with G658A. Neither mutations affect protein stability or cause a dominant mutator effect. Together with our studies on G658, D661 and F670 [1], this study implicates the signature motif as a primary regulator of MutS function and suggests concerted action of the individual amino acid residues within this motif in mediating communication between the Walker and mismatch recognition domains.",

Low-concentrations of NO, generated by spermidine, were proved to induce cell proliferation, DSB and MN simultaneously. The proliferation or shortened cell cycle in bystander cells gave them insufficient time to repair DSBs.

CHO cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of SN and chromosomal aberrations were analyzed in the first mitosis after treatment. Cytogenetic analysis revealed that 16.9% and 11.7% of the total aberrations induced by SN in cells harvested 18\u00a0h and 3\u00a0h after treatment, respectively, exhibited one or more FISH-detectable telomeric signals. Although there was a significant induction by SN of chromosome breaks at centromeric regions containing ITSs, about 70% of the chromosome breaks exhibiting telomeric signals observed in SN-treated cells occurred outside the centromeric regions of chromosomes. This observation, along with the finding of entirely labeled acentric fragments in both untreated and SN-treated cells show that, although this antibiotic induces breakage at centromeric regions containing ITSs, these chromosome regions are not the preferential target for the clastogenic action of SN. In addition, our results show that heterochromatic ITSs are involved more than expected in the formation of chromatid breaks and exchanges induced by SN, and that these sequences are not preferentially involved in the formation of dicentrics, multicentrics, centric rings, chromosome breaks, acentric fragments and chromatid deletions induced by this antibiotic. These findings indicate that the involvement of heterochromatic ITSs in the chromosome damage induced by SN is not random. Moreover, our results show that SN induces telomeric repeats translocations, although this effect depends on the concentration of the drug, and that this antibiotic increases the size of ITSs, this latter effect not being related to the chromosomal sensitivity of the exposed cells to this compound. The mechanism by which SN induces amplification of heterochromatic ITSs remains to be elucidated.",

To this aim the amount of DNA damage induced by \u03b3-rays and DNA repair capacity were evaluated in unstimulated (G0) and mitogen-simulated (G2) PBMC from 20 healthy subjects and in EBV-transformed LCL obtained from the same individuals. Phosphorylation of histone H2AX, micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations were the end-points investigated.The results obtained show higher basal frequencies of binucleated cells bearing micronuclei and nucleoplasmic bridge (NPB) in LCL with respect to PBMC, suggesting that EBV transformation may be associated with chromosomal instability. After irradiation, higher levels of micronuclei were induced in G0-treated PBMC compared to cycling LCL; conversely, NPB were more frequent in LCL than in PBMC. Moreover, higher levels of chromosomal aberrations were observed in G2-treated PBMC compared to LCL. Concerning \u03b3-H2AX measurements, phosphorylation levels 1\u00a0h after treatment and dephosphorylation kinetics were basically similar in LCL and in PBMC. However, while Spearman's test showed a strong correlation between the results obtained in replicated experiments with PBMC, high inter-experimental variability and poor reproducibility was observed in the experiments performed with LCL, possibly due to the intrinsic instability of LCL.In summary, both the analysis of \u03b3-H2AX and the evaluation of chromosome damage highlighted a larger inter-experimental variability in the results obtained with LCL compared to PBMC. Noteworthy, the two set of results proved to lack any significant correlation at the individual level. These results indicate that LCL may be unsuitable for investigating genotype\u2013phenotype correlations with phenotypic DNA repair assays, especially when low impact functional genetic variants are involved.",

However, the role of SNP309 in hepatocarcinogenesis with respect to TP53 mutations is unknown. In this study, we investigated the distribution of the MDM2 SNP309 genotype and somatic TP53 (the p53 tumor suppressor gene) mutations in 99 human HCC samples from Africa, Europe, China and Japan. Samples exhibited striking geographical differences in their distribution of SNP309 genotypes. The frequency and spectrum of p53 mutations also varied geographically; TP53 mutations were frequent in Africa, where the SNP309 T/T genotype predominated but were rare in Europe and Japan, where the SNP309 G allele was present more frequently.TP53 mutations were detected in 18% (4/22) of SNP309 T/G and G/G and 82% (18/22) of SNP309 T/T genotype holders; this difference was statistically highly significant (P-value\u00a0=\u00a00.0006).Our results indicated that the presence of the SNP309 G allele is inversely associated with the presence of somatic TP53 mutations because they only coincided in 4% of HCC cases. This finding suggests that the SNP309 G allele may functionally replace p53 mutations, and in addition to known etiological factors, may be partly responsible for differential HCC prevalence.",

     "abstract": "The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay has emerged as a biomarker of chromosome damage relevant to cancer. Although it was initially developed to measure micronuclei, it is also useful for measuring nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds. Abnormal nuclear morphologies are frequently observed in malignant tissues and short-term tumour cell cultures. Changes in chromosome structure and number resulting from chromosome instability are important factors in oncogenesis. Telomeres have become key players in the initiation of chromosome instability related to carcinogenesis by means of breakage\u2013fusion\u2013bridge cycles. To better understand the connection between telomere dysfunction and the appearance of abnormal nuclear morphologies, we have characterised the presence of micronuclei, nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds in human mammary primary epithelial cells. These cells can proliferate beyond the Hayflick limit by spontaneously losing expression of the p16INK4a protein. Progressive telomere shortening leads to the loss of the capping function, and the appearance of end-to-end chromosome fusions that can enter into breakage\u2013fusion\u2013bridge cycles generating massive chromosomal instability. In human mammary epithelial cells, different types of abnormal nuclear morphologies were observed, however only nucleoplasmatic bridges and buds increased significantly with population doublings. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation using centromeric and painting specific probes for chromosomes with eroded telomeres has revealed that these chromosomes are preferentially included in the different types of abnormal nuclear morphologies observed, thus reflecting their common origin. Accordingly, real-time imaging of cell divisions enabled us to determine that anaphase bridge resolution was mainly through chromatin breakage and the formation of symmetric buds in daughter nuclei. Few micronuclei emerged in this cell system thus validating the scoring of nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds for measuring chromosome instability in telomere-dysfunction cell environments.",

Miscoding etheno-modified DNA adducts including 1,N6-etheno-2\u2032-deoxyadenosine (\u025bdA) are formed by reaction of HNE with DNA-bases which are excreted in urine, following elimination from tissue DNA. An ultrasensitive and specific immunoprecipitation/HPLC-fluorescence detection method was developed for quantifying \u025bdA excreted in urine.

Based on this pilot study we conclude: (i) high urinary \u025bdA-levels, reflecting massive LPO-derived DNA damage in vivo may contribute to the development of HCC; (ii) \u025bdA-measurements in urine and target tissues should thus be further explored as a putative risk marker to follow malignant progression of inflammatory liver diseases in affected patients; (iii) etheno adducts may serve as biomarkers to assess the efficacy of (chemo-)preventive and therapeutic interventions.",

     "abstract": "Ionizing radiation induces delayed destabilization of the genome in the progenies of surviving cells. This phenomenon, which is called radiation-induced genomic instability, is manifested by delayed induction of radiation effects, such as cell death, chromosome aberration, and mutation in the progeny of cells surviving radiation exposure. Previously, there was a report showing that delayed cell death was absent in Ku80-deficient Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, however, the mechanism of their defect has not been determined. We found that delayed induction of DNA double strand breaks and chromosomal breaks were intact in Ku80-deficient cells surviving X-irradiation, whereas there was no sign for the production of chromosome bridges between divided daughter cells. Moreover, delayed induction of dicentric chromosomes was significantly compromised in those cells compared to the wild-type CHO cells. Reintroduction of the human Ku86 gene complimented the defective DNA repair and recovered delayed induction of dicentric chromosomes and delayed cell death, indicating that defective Ku80-dependent dicentric induction was the cause of the absence of delayed cell death. Since DNA-PKcs-defective cells showed delayed phenotypes, Ku80-dependent illegitimate rejoining is involved in delayed impairment of the integrity of the genome in radiation-survived cells.",

     "abstract": "One of the most controversial issue regarding high-frequency electromagnetic fields (HF-EMF) is their putative capacity to affect DNA integrity. This is of particular concern due to the increasing use of HF-EMF in communication technologies, including mobile phones. Although epidemiological studies report no detrimental effects on human health, the possible disturbance generated by HF-EMF on cell physiology remains controversial. In addition, the question remains as to whether cells are able to compensate their potential effects. We have previously reported that a 1-h exposure to amplitude-modulated 1.8\u00a0GHz sinusoidal waves (GSM-217\u00a0Hz, SAR\u00a0=\u00a02\u00a0W/kg) largely used in mobile telephony did not cause increased levels of primary DNA damage in human trophoblast HTR-8/SVneo cells. Nevertheless, further investigations on trophoblast cell responses after exposure to GSM signals of different types and durations were considered of interest. In the present work, HTR-8/SVneo cells were exposed for 4, 16 or 24\u00a0h to 1.8\u00a0GHz continuous wave (CW) and different GSM signals, namely GSM-217\u00a0Hz and GSM-Talk (intermittent exposure: 5\u00a0min field on, 10\u00a0min field off). The alkaline comet assay was used to evaluate primary DNA damages and/or strand breaks due to uncompleted repair processes in HF-EMF exposed samples. The amplitude-modulated signals GSM-217\u00a0Hz and GSM-Talk induced a significant increase in comet parameters in trophoblast cells after 16 and 24\u00a0h of exposure, while the un-modulated CW was ineffective. However, alterations were rapidly recovered and the DNA integrity of HF-EMF exposed cells was similar to that of sham-exposed cells within 2\u00a0h of recovery in the absence irradiation. Our data suggest that HF-EMF with a carrier frequency and modulation scheme typical of the GSM signal may affect the DNA integrity.",

This enzyme is genetically variable in human populations and polymorphisms in the NAT2 gene have been associated with drug toxicity and efficacy as well as cancer susceptibility. Here, we have focused on the identification of NAT2 variants in Brazilian individuals from two different regions, Rio de Janeiro and Goi\u00e1s, by direct sequencing, and on the characterization of new haplotypes after cloning and re-sequencing. Upon analysis of DNA samples from 404 individuals, six new SNPs (c.29T>C, c.152G>T, c.203G>A, c.228C>T, c.458C>T and c.600A>G) and seven new NAT2 alleles were identified with different frequencies in Rio de Janeiro and Goi\u00e1s. All new SNPs were found as singletons (observed only once in 808 genes) and were confirmed by three independent technical replicates. Molecular modeling and structural analysis suggested that p.Gly51Val variant may have an important effect on substrate recognition by NAT2. We also observed that amino acid change p.Cys68Tyr would affect acetylating activity due to the resulting geometric restrictions and incompatibility of the functional group in the Tyr side chain with the admitted chemical mechanism for catalysis by NATs. Moreover, other variants, such like p.Thr153Ile, p.Thr193Met, p.Pro228Leu and p.Val280Met, may lead to the presence of hydrophobic residues on NAT2 surface involved in protein aggregation and/or targeted degradation. Finally, the new alleles NAT2*6H and NAT2*5N, which showed the highest frequency in the Brazilian populations considered in this study, may code for a slow activity. Functional studies are needed to clarify the mechanisms by which new SNPs interfere with acetylation.",

In order to determine the role of Pol\u03b7 in the biological fate of Me-lex induced lesions, the RAD30 (Pol\u03b7) gene was deleted in the yIG397 parental strain and in its rev3 (Pol\u03b6) derivative, and the strains transformed with plasmid DNA damaged in vitro by Me-lex. While deletion of RAD30 increased the toxicity of Me-lex, the impact on mutagenicity varied depending on the concentration of Me-lex induced DNA damage and the overall TLS capacity of the cells. For the first time the Me-lex induced mutation spectrum in rad30 strain was determined and compared with the spectrum previously determined in WT strain. Overall, the two mutation spectra were not significantly different. The effect on mutation frequency and the features of the Me-lex induced mutation spectra were suggestive of error prone (significant decrease of mutation frequency and significant decrease of AT\u00a0>\u00a0TA at a mutation hotspot in rad30 vs RAD30) but also error free (significant increase of AT\u00a0>\u00a0GC in rad30 vs RAD30) Pol\u03b7 dependent bypass of lesions. In summary, our previous results with Pol\u03b6 and Rev1 mutants, the present results with Pol\u03b7, and the known physical and functional interactions among TLS proteins, lead us to propose that the bypass of Me-lex induced lesions is a multi-DNA polymerases process that is mostly effective when all three yeast TLS polymerases are present.",

Adult lifespan was not detectably different between wild-type and NER-deficient xpa-1 nematodes under control conditions. However, exposure to 6\u00a0J/m2/day of ultraviolet C radiation (UVC) decreased lifespan in xpa-1 nematodes more than a dose of 100\u00a0J/m2/day in wild-type. Similar differential sensitivities were observed for adult size and feeding. Remarkably, global gene expression was nearly identical in young adult wild-type and xpa-1 nematodes, both in control conditions and 3\u00a0h after exposure to 50\u00a0J/m2 UVC. Neither NER genes nor repair activity were detectably inducible in young adults that lacked germ cells and developing embryos (glp-1 strain).

Telomeric dysfunction may be implicated in a variety of diseases. We measured mean telomere length in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) from patients with various rheumatologic diseases. Mean PBL telomere length was measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) assay in a control population (n\u00a0=\u00a0130; age range: 3\u201394 years) and in subjects diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA; n\u00a0=\u00a086; age range: 31\u201382 years), psoriatic arthritis (PA; n\u00a0=\u00a056; age range: 26\u201379 years) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS; n\u00a0=\u00a059; age range: 21\u201375 years). These diseases are associated with chronic systemic inflammatory activity. Telomere length was also quantified in subjects with osteoarthritis (OA; n\u00a0=\u00a034; age range: 43\u201382 years) and osteoporosis (OP; n\u00a0=\u00a035; age range: 59\u201395 years), diseases without a chronic systemic inflammatory component. Telomere length in OA showed no differences from age-matched controls (p\u00a0=\u00a00.234), but was significantly shorter in OP (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

These findings were heavily debated for two main reasons; the lack of reproducibility, and the absence of a plausible scientific rationale for how EMFs could damage DNA. Starting out from a replication of the relevant experiments, we performed this study to clarify the existence and explore origin and nature of ELF-EMF induced DNA effects. Our data confirm that intermittent (but not continuous) exposure of human primary fibroblasts to a 50\u00a0Hz EMF at a flux density of 1\u00a0mT induces a slight but significant increase of DNA fragmentation in the Comet assay, and we provide first evidence for this to be caused by the magnetic rather than the electric field. Moreover, we show that EMF-induced responses in the Comet assay are dependent on cell proliferation, suggesting that processes of DNA replication rather than the DNA itself may be affected. Consistently, the Comet effects correlated with a reduction of actively replicating cells and a concomitant increase of apoptotic cells in exposed cultures, whereas a combined Fpg-Comet test failed to produce evidence for a notable contribution of oxidative DNA base damage. Hence, ELF-EMF induced effects in the Comet assay are reproducible under specific conditions and can be explained by minor disturbances in S-phase processes and occasional triggering of apoptosis rather than by the generation of DNA damage.",

     "abstract": "The repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in male germ cells is slower and differently regulated compared to that in somatic cells. Round spermatids show DSB repair and are radioresistant to apoptosis induction. Mutation induction studies using ionizing irradiation, indicated a high frequency of chromosome aberrations (CA) in the next generation. Since they are in a G1 comparable stage of the cell cycle, haploid spermatids are expected to repair DSBs by the non-homologous end-joining pathway (NHEJ). However, immunohistochemical evidence indicates that not all components of the classical NHEJ pathway are available since the presence of DNA-PKcs cannot be shown. Here, we demonstrate that round spermatids, as well as most other types of male germ cells express both Parp1 and XRCC1. Therefore, we have determined whether the alternative Parp1/XRCC1 dependent NHEJ pathway is active in these nuclei and also have tested for classical NHEJ activity by a genetic method. To evaluate DSB repair in SCID mice, deficient for DNA-PKcs, and to study the involvement of the Parp1/XRCC1 dependent NHEJ pathway in round spermatids, the loss of \u03b3-H2AX foci after irradiation has been determined in nucleus spreads of round spermatids of SCID mice and in nucleus spreads and histological sections of Parp1-inhibited mice and their respective controls. Results show that around half of the breaks in randomly selected round spermatids are repaired between 1 and 8\u00a0h after irradiation. The repair of 16% of the induced DSBs requires DNA-PKcs and 21% Parp1. Foci numbers in the Parp1-inhibited testes tend to be higher in spermatids of all epithelial stages reaching significance in stages I\u2013III which indicates an active Parp1/XRCC1 pathway in round spermatids and a decreased repair capacity in later round spermatid stages. In Parp1-inhibited SCID mice only 14.5% of the breaks were repaired 8\u00a0h after irradiation indicating additivity of the two NHEJ pathways in round spermatids.",

Quiescent G0/G1-phase cultures were exposed to 5, 10, and 25\u00a0cGy and allowed to repair for 24\u00a0h.

Significantly slower focus formation post-irradiation was observed in seven normal strains, similar to most mutant strains examined. There was variation in repair efficiency measured by the fraction of IR-induced foci remaining 24\u00a0h post-irradiation, curiously with the strains having slower focus formation showing more efficient repair after 25\u00a0cGy. Interestingly, the ranges of spontaneous and residual induced foci levels at 24\u00a0h in the normal strains were as least as large as those observed for the repair-defective mutant strains. The inter-individual variation in DSB foci parameters observed in cells exposed to low doses of ionizing radiation in this small survey of apparently normal people suggests that hypomorphic genetic variants in genomic maintenance and/or DNA damage signaling and repair genes may contribute to differential susceptibility to cancer induced by environmental mutagens.",

Twenty-seven polymorphisms in genes related to oxidative stress and one in As(+III)methyltransferase (AS3MT) were studied.Median concentration of 8-oxodG was 4.7\u00a0nmol/L (adjusted for specific weight; range 1.6\u201313, corresponding to 1.7\u00a0\u03bcg/g creatinine, range 0.57\u20134.8) and of total urinary As metabolites (U-As) 290\u00a0\u03bcg/L (range 94\u2013720; 380\u00a0\u03bcg/g creatinine, range 140\u20131100).

Here we have characterized rpoB/Rifr system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida as a test system for studying mutational processes. We found that in addition to the appearance of large colonies which were clearly visible on Rif selective plates already after 24\u00a0h of plating, small colonies grew up on these plates for 48\u00a0h. The time-dependent appearance of the mutant colonies onto selective plates was caused by different levels of Rif resistance of the mutants. The Rifr clusters of the rpoB gene were sequenced and analyzed for 360 mutants of P. aeruginosa and for 167 mutants of P. putida. The spectrum of Rifr mutations characterized for P. aeruginosa grown at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and that characterized for P. putida grown at 30\u00a0\u00b0C were dissimilar but the differences almost disappeared when the mutants of both strain were isolated at the same temperature, at 30\u00a0\u00b0C. The strong Rifr phenotype of P. aeruginosa and P. putida was accompanied only with substitutions of these residues which belong to the putative Rif-binding pocket. Approximately 70% of P. aeruginosa mutants, which were isolated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and expressed weak Rifr phenotype, contained base substitutions in the N-terminal cluster of the rpoB gene. The differences in the spectra of mutations at 30\u00a0\u00b0C and 37\u00a0\u00b0C can be explained by temperature-sensitive growth of several mutants in the presence of rifampicin.

     "abstract": "Aberrant repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) is thought to be important in the generation of gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs). To examine how DNA DSBs might lead to GCRs, we investigated the repair of a single DNA DSB in a structurally unstable cell line. An I-SceI recognition site was introduced into OVCAR-8 cells between a constitutive promoter (EF1\u03b1) and the Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (TK) gene, which confers sensitivity to gancyclovir (GCV). Expression of I-SceI in these cells caused a single DSB. Clones with aberrant repair could acquire resistance to GCV by separation of the EF1\u03b1 promoter from the TK gene, or deletion of either the EF1\u03b1 promoter or the TK gene. All mutations that we identified were interstitial deletions. Treatment of cells with etoposide or bleomycin, agents known to produce DNA DSBs following expression of I-SceI also did not generate GCRs. Because we identified solely interstitial deletions using the aforementioned negative selection system, we developed a positive selection system to produce GCR. A construct containing an I-SceI restriction site immediately followed by a hygromycin phosphotransferase cDNA, with no promoter, was stably integrated into OVCAR-8 cells. DNA DSBs were produced by an I-SceI expression vector. None of the hygromycin resistant clones recovered had linked the hygromycin phosphotransferase cDNA to an endogenous promoter, but had instead captured a portion of the I-SceI expression vector. These results indicate that even in a structurally unstable malignant cell line, the majority of DNA DSBs are repaired by religation of the two broken chromosome ends, without the introduction of a GCR.",

     "abstract": "Berberis lycium Royle (Berberidacea) from Pakistan and its alkaloids berberine and palmatine have been reported to possess beneficial pharmacological properties. In the present study, the anti-neoplastic activities of different B. lycium root extracts and the major constituting alkaloids, berberine and palmatine were investigated in p53-deficient HL-60 cells.The strongest growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects were found in the n-butanol (BuOH) extract followed by the ethyl acetate (EtOAc)-, and the water (H2O) extract.The chemical composition of the BuOH extract was analyzed by TLC and quantified by HPLC. 11.1\u00a0\u03bcg BuOH extract (that was gained from 1\u00a0mg dried root) contained 2.0\u00a0\u03bcg berberine and 0.3\u00a0\u03bcg/ml palmatine. 1.2\u00a0\u03bcg/ml berberine inhibited cell proliferation significantly, while 0.5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml palmatine had no effect. Berberine and the BuOH extract caused accumulation of HL-60 cells in S-phase. This was preceded by a strong activation of Chk2, phosphorylation and degradation of Cdc25A, and the subsequent inactivation of Cdc2 (CDK1). Furthermore, berberine and the extract inhibited the expression of the proto-oncogene cyclin D1. Berberine and the BuOH extract induced the acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin and this correlated with the induction of apoptosis. The data demonstrate that berberine is a potent anti-neoplastic compound that acts via anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic mechanisms independent of genotoxicity.",
