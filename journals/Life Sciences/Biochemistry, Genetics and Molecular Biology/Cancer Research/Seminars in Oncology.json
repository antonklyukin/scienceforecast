     "abstract": "Following Liebeskind et al [1], we have attempted to find consensus ages for the protein-coding and the noncoding genes of the human genome, using publicly-available ortholog databases. For each database separately, we determined its age estimate for the genes it listed, determining this by identifying the earliest ortholog for the gene in question. We assigned these ages to 1 of the 19 major phylostrata defined by Domazet-Loso and Tautz [2], 2 of which were further subdivided. From these various estimates, we found the modal value if 1 was present, defining this as the consensus age for the gene. For the genes where no consensus value could be found, we recorded the median value of the age estimates across the databases interrogated. We present a resource that lists the age, as so defined, of every one of the 19,660 protein-coding genes and of 5,981 of the 16,528 non\u2013protein-coding genes of the human genome, the age being the time when the gene was accreted to the evolving human genome. We calculate the number of genes that accreted to the genome, epoch by epoch, and consider the rate at which they accreted.",

The present manuscript uses those results to derive the ages of the genes on the COSMIC list of somatic mutations in cancer. The lymphoma-associated genes in the COSMIC list are younger than the sarcoma-associated or the carcinoma-associated genes, or the genes shared by lymphomas and carcinomas. Genes that accreted to the evolving genome with the appearance of the fish are major contributors to the sarcoma-, lymphoma-, or carcinoma-associated gene sets, but it is genes accreted during the development of multicellularity that contribute most to the genes common to the classes. Genes arising with the evolution of the fish are also dominant in a list of noncoding genes associated with cancer.

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with limited effective therapeutic options and exceedingly high mortality rates. Currently, cure can only be achieved through resection, however the vast majority of patients present with advanced disease for which upfront surgery is not an option. In an effort to improve surgical candidacy, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy, is often used in an effort to downstage borderline resectable and locally advanced tumors, and some argue for its use even in patients with resectable tumors. Underlying this thinking is the recognition that pancreatic cancer is simultaneously both a locally invasive and systemic disease, even in patients without evidence of metastasis on imaging. Current evidence to date is largely retrospective, but suggests that neoadjuvant therapy can increase R0 (pathologically negative margin) resection rates and improve overall survival. The standard approach to neoadjuvant treatment involves choosing between the two most active combination regimens for metastatic disease, namely modified FOLFIRNOX and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel. Nonrandomized data indicate that these regimens can yield resection rates up to 68% and 36%, in borderline resectable and locally advanced PDAC, respectively. Furthermore, randomized data in patients with resectable PDAC treated with gemcitabine-based neoadjuvant therapy suggests that despite an approximate 10% drop in resection rates, there is a significant improvement in median overall survival. Herein, we will discuss the rationale for neoadjuvant therapy, current and former treatment regimens, common issues faced by clinicians when using these combinations, and several ongoing clinical trials.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is considered to be one of the most aggressive cancers. For unknown reasons, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is slowly rising and so too are mortality rates. Over 75% of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced disease or with metastases; and more than 95% of patients have metastases at diagnosis or will develop metastases during their follow-up. Despite recent improvements in the therapy of pancreatic cancer, initially with demonstration of the activity of the FOLFIRINOX regimen and subsequently the approval of nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine, prognosis remains poor and the 5-year survival rate is less than 5%. To date, neither personalized medicine nor immunotherapy, the 2 recent revolutions of cancer treatment, have delivered major positive results in the treatment of pancreatic cancer; and it is especially clear that immune checkpoint inhibitors will not become a major tool in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. There are many ongoing studies, including those exploring combinations of chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Vaccines or T cells modified with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T cells) could also play a role in the treatment of cancer in the future. The aim of this review is to discuss recent improvements in standard of care, major obstacles to overcome, recent results of new treatment combinations, and the most interesting innovative approaches.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is a lethal disease with a very poor prognosis. In contrast to treatments for many other tumor types, cytotoxic agents are still the first-line drugs for pancreatic cancer in both the palliative and adjuvant settings. Some progress has been made in recent years, but most large phase 3 studies have not shown significant improvements in survival. Because the available drugs and regimens are limited in both type and effect, the selection of chemotherapy based on clinicopathologic characteristics may be consequential for pancreatic cancer. In the present report, we focused on 7 landmark clinical trials for pancreatic cancer. We observed that FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin) and NG (nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine), 2 first-line regimens, exerted opposite effects on metastatic pancreatic cancer patients with different baseline carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels. This suggested that not only the performance status but possibly also CA19-9 levels should be considered when making a therapeutic choice for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Moreover, we found that patients with a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer who have undergone a surgical resection with a negative margin (R0) may benefit more from fluorouracil and/or oral prodrugs of fluorouracil-based adjuvant therapy than from gemcitabine. Conversely, gemcitabine or gemcitabine-based regimens may be more effective for patients with a positive resection margin (R1). Based on these findings, we propose flowcharts for selecting chemotherapy for both advanced and resected pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, we present possible mechanisms and interpretations underlying the selection of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer and propose the tumor burden as a key variable in this process. Regardless of the possible bias and exact treatment selection process, this study offers an opportunity to improve patient outcomes by using agents currently used in the therapy of pancreatic cancer. Although these conclusions are based on indirect evidence, we provide insights and possibilities to drive the selection of chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer.",

The impact of NS has been primarily studied in hematologic malignancies. This review is intended to summarize literature reporting on the association of NS and treatment-related outcomes in pediatric solid tumors.We searched four electronic databases from inception through August 2018 without language restriction, and included studies of children with cancers arising from renal, bone, liver, eye, muscle, vascular, germ cell, and neural crest tissues, reporting on NS as a predictor for toxicity, survival or relapse. Due to data heterogeneity and limited availability of studies, formal statistical analysis was not achievable. Descriptive statistics were summarized in table format.Of 8,991 reports identified, 75 full-text articles were evaluated, 10 of which met inclusion criteria. Up to 62% of patients were over- or undernourished at diagnosis. Abnormal BMI was associated with worse overall survival in Ewing sarcoma (hazard ratio (HR): 3.46, P\u202f=\u202f.022), osteosarcoma (HR: 1.6, P < .005), and a trend toward poorer overall survival in rhabdomyosarcoma (HR: 1.70, P\u202f=\u202f.0596). High BMI in osteosarcoma was associated with increased nephrotoxicity (odds ratio: 2.8, P\u202f=\u202f.01) and postoperative complications. NS was not a significant predictor of outcomes in other included disease categories.Existing literature supports the prognostic significance of NS in pediatric solid tumor patients and underscores the need for prospective studies to better elucidate underlying physiological changes in this population.",

Lenvatinib is approved as a monotherapy for the treatment of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer and in combination with everolimus for the second-line treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Lenvatinib is also under investigation for the treatment of several malignancies including unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. Although lenvatinib is associated with favorable efficacy, it is associated with adverse events (AEs) that the clinician will have to closely monitor for and proactively manage. Most of these AEs are known class effects of VEGF-targeted therapies, including hypertension, diarrhea, fatigue or asthenia, decreased appetite, and weight loss. This review summarizes the safety profile of lenvatinib and offers guidance for the management of both frequent and rare AEs. We discuss the potential mechanisms underlying these AEs and present practical recommendations for managing toxicities. The development of treatment plans that include prophylactic and therapeutic strategies for the management of lenvatinib-associated AEs has the potential to improve patient quality of life, optimize adherence, minimize the need for dose reductions, treatment interruptions, or discontinuations, and maximize patient outcomes.",

Unfortunately, too often use in adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings fails to improve overall survival. Reasons for the modest benefits include the fact that in many cases surgery cures a majority of patients making it difficult to demonstrate gains. We begin by looking at the history of adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies and the principles guiding their development. We summarize accepted adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies in several cancers and tabulate their outcomes. Then, extending our work on the growth and regression rate constants of tumors and the fraction of cells killed we demonstrate that therapies developed in the metastatic setting primarily delay tumor growth rather than kill more cells and argue this is a likely explanation for poor outcomes in adjuvant or neoadjuvant settings. We suggest a rational approach for enhancing success.",

     "abstract": "The molecular pathogenesis of follicular lymphoma (FL) was partially revealed 3 decades ago, with the discovery of the translocation that brings BCL2 under the influence of immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancers in a vast majority of cases. Despite the importance of this seminal observation, it has become increasingly clear that additional genetic alterations need to occur to trigger neoplastic transformation and disease progression. The evolution of FL involves developmental arrest and disruption of the normal function of one or more of epigenetic regulators including KMT2D/MLL2, EZH2, CBP/CREBBP, p300/EP300, and HIST1H1 in >95% of cases. B-cells \u201carrested\u201d in germinal centers acquire dozens of additional genetic aberrations that influence key pathways controlling their physiological development including B Cell Receptor (BCR) signaling, PI3K/AKT, TLR, mTOR, NF-\u03baB, JAK/STAT, MAPK, CD40/CD40L, chemokine, and interleukin signaling. Additionally, most cases of FL do not result from linear accumulation of genomic aberrations, but rather evolve from a common progenitor cell population by diverse evolution, creating multiple FL subclones in one patient. Moreover, one of the subclones might acquire a combination of aberrations involving genes controlling cell survival and proliferation including MDM2, CDKN2A/B, BCL6, MYC, TP53, \u03b22M, FOXO1, MYD88, STAT3, or miR-17-92, and this can lead to the transformation of an initially indolent FL to an aggressive lymphoma (2%-3% risk per year). The complexity of the disease is also underscored by the importance of its interactions with the microenvironment that can substantially influence disease development and prognosis. Interpreting individual aberrations in relation to their impact on normal processes, their frequency, position in the disease evolution, and the consequences of their (co)occurrence, are the basis for understanding FL pathogenesis. This is necessary for the identification of patients with risk of early progression or transformation, for the development of novel targeted therapies, and for personalized treatment approaches. In this review, we summarize recent knowledge of molecular pathways and microenvironmental components involved in FL biology, and discuss them in the context of physiological B-cell development, FL evolution, and targeted therapies.",

The aim of this report was to schematically review all the approved pharmacologic treatment options for patients with mCRPC through 2018, analyzing the efficacy and possible side effects of each therapy to assist clinicians in reaching an appropriate treatment decision. New biomarkers potentially of aid in the choice of treatment in this setting are also briefly reviewed.We performed a literature search of clinical trials of new drugs and treatments for patients diagnosed with mCRPC published through 2018.Two new hormonal drugs, abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide have been approved by FDA in 2011 and 2012, respectively for the treatment of patients with mCRPC and have undergone extensive testing. While these treatments have shown a benefit in progression-free and overall survival, the appropriate sequencing must still be determined so that treatment decisions can be made based on their specific clinical profile. Cabazitaxel has been shown to be an efficient therapeutic option in a postdocetaxel setting, while its role in chemotherapy-na\u00efve patients must still be determined. Sipuleucel-T and radium-223 have been studied in patients without visceral metastases and have achieved overall survival benefits with good safety profiles. The feasibility and efficacy of combinations of new treatments with other known therapies such as chemotherapy are currently under investigation.Drug development efforts continue to attempt to prolong survival and improve quality of life in the mCRPC setting, with several therapeutic options available. Ongoing and future trials are needed to further assess the efficacy and safety of these new drugs and their interactions, along with the most appropriate sequencing.",

The objective of this study was to examine age-related differences in patient-reported symptoms and functional domains in patients with advanced lung cancer receiving immunotherapy drugs.Three randomized controlled trials of anti-programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy in patients with advanced non\u2013small cell lung cancer that included patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were identified. Baseline PRO data were pooled for treatment arms from 2 trials that included the same PRO tools. Age-related differences in baseline mean scores for each of the health-related quality of life functional and symptom scales were assessed for patients \u226570 years and <70 years. Mean change from Baseline at 3 months was also calculated and plotted for each age group. The adequacy of PRO assessments was assessed by comparing clinician-reported AE data in the 3 trials to the item content of the PRO tools included.Across the 3 trials, 75 of patients were under 70 and 26% patients were 70 and older. Comparing baseline scores in the 2 trials with the same PRO tool, older adults reported small differences including lower physical functioning, less pain, insomnia and financial difficulties, and higher social functioning than younger patients at baseline. No large differences in the distributions of mean change from baseline in function or symptom were identified. Several common clinician-reported symptomatic AEs were not assessed by the PRO strategy employed in the 3 trials. Three clinician-reported symptomatic AEs (rash, fever, and pruritus) that were commonly reported in the safety data (9%\u201319%) were not assessed using the PRO tools employed.While several small differences were seen, there did not appear to be large differences at baseline or in the distributions of change from baseline in PRO functional domains between younger and older patients with lung cancer undergoing anti-programmed death receptor -1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy. Relevant symptomatic side effects were not assessed by PRO measures in these trials, and this is a limitation of current PRO assessment strategies.",

For this reason, noninvasive ablative therapies are necessary. Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is an effective modality in addressing early-stage NSCLC. SBRT consists of high-dose radiation delivered over 3\u20135 treatments.

However, a recent pooled analysis from 2 randomized trials (StereoTActic Radiotherapy and Radiosurgery Or Surgery for operable Early-stage non\u2013small cell Lung cancer) comparing surgery to SBRT did show comparable local control and overall survival rates between surgery and SBRT, offering a very effective, noninvasive modality for older adult patients with early-stage NSCLC.

Demographics, efficacy, and safety data from these trials were pooled and aggregated based on age. The relative treatment effects on overall survival (OS) across age groups were evaluated using Kaplan\u2013Meier methodology. A meta-analysis was performed comparing OS across age groups treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies compared with those treated with docetaxel, as a common control arm across trials. A Cox Proportional Hazards model, stratified by clinical trial, was used and a univariate and multivariate adjusted analysis of OS to further identify trends in efficacy across age groups.Among patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies enrolled across the 4 clinical trials, 42% were >65 years of age, 99% had ECOG performance status of 0\u20131, 75% had received 1 prior therapy, and 76% were diagnosed with Stage IV disease. In the pooled analysis of 2,824 patients across both arms, the treatment effects in age-defined subgroups were similar, with a hazard ratios (HR), unadjusted or adjusted, for OS of 0.71 (95% confidence interval 0.63, 0.80) in patients <65 years and 0.66 (0.57, 0.76) in patients \u226565 years of age. In patients \u226570 years, the HR for OS was 0.67 (0.55. 0.82) and in patients \u2265 75 years, the HR was 0.81 (0.58, 1.13). Estimated median OS in patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies versus docetaxel was 14.5 months versus 8.8 months in patients <65 years, 14.2 months versus 9 months in patients \u226565 years, 14.1 versus 9.2 months in patients \u226570 years, and 14.7 versus 9.5 months in the patients \u226575years.Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies were less frequent in patients \u226575 years (23%) compared to patients> 65 year ( 49%) and < 65 years (47%), as were serious adverse events (30%, 32.5%, 15%); however, treatment-emergent adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment (7%, 7%, and 5%) in those subgroups \u226465 years, >65 years, and >75 years, respectively, were similar.Patients 65 and older with advanced and metastatic NSCLC, including those \u226575 years, seem to derive similar survival benefits from treatment with PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies as patients <65 years of age. Patients 75 and older enrolled on these trials appear to tolerate PD-1/PD-L1 blocking antibodies and have a lower incidence of grade 3 or 4 treatment-emergent adverse events compared to the subgroup of patients < 65 years of age.",

We evaluated interactions according to type of treatment\u2013add-on strategy: pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy or head-to-head strategy: pembrolizumab alone versus chemotherapy. Hazard and Odds Ratios (HR/OR) for primary (overall survival, OS) and secondary endpoints (progression-free survival, PFS and objective response rate, ORR) were extracted and cumulated by adopting a random-effect model with 95% confidence interval. Four clinical trials that enrolled 2,754 patients including 1,252 with PD-L1 expression in \u226550% of cells were examined. We did not find a significant interaction (P = 0.16) between an add-on strategy and head-to-head comparisons with pembrolizumab for OS (HRs in favor of immunotherapy of 0.50 and 0.67, respectively). A significant quantitative interaction favoring the add-on strategy was found for PFS and ORR (P < 0.001), with a HR for PFS of 0.36 with the add-on strategy and 0.65 in head-to head comparisons, and an OR for ORR of 5.35 and 1.58, respectively. In absence of planned prospective noninferiority trials addressing this issue, addition of chemotherapy to pembrolizumab appears to decrease tumor size and delay disease progression significantly more than pembrolizumab alone, but has no impact on OS.

     "abstract": "Side effects of immune checkpoint blockade are often said to be infrequent and usually mild. The uniqueness of endocrine immune-related adverse events is their non-reversibility, with incidence and prevalence destined to increase in the coming years, particularly if immunotherapy is used at earlier stages of neoplastic disease. Immune-related hypophysitis is one of these observed endocrine adverse events. It is often difficult to diagnose, sometimes occurring without specific symptoms. It can lead to irreversibly altered functioning of diverse endocrine glands. Radiographically, the differential diagnosis of hypophysitis includes pituitary apoplexy and primary and secondary neoplastic lesions. Immune-related hypophysitis is most common with single-agent anti-CTLA-4, followed by the combination of anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1, while occurs infrequently when anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 agents are administered alone. Hypophysitis with immune checkpoint blockade requires early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment. Patients can present with headache, visual disturbances or other endocrine-related syndromes or they can be asymptomatic. The manifestation of symptoms should prompt blood analysis and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Imaging is important to exclude secondary meningeal or parenchymal lesions. Management should include discontinuation of the immune checkpoint blockade, initiation of corticosteroid therapy and eventually hormone replacement therapy. Hypophysitis impacts treatment of the disease and usually requires long-term management of this irreversible side effect. A multidisciplinary team approach is merited to insure the correct diagnosis and management of immune-related hypophysitis.",

     "abstract": "Cancer control is a wider concept than oncology, and includes comprehensive actions for prevention, early diagnosis, treatment, services organization, and education, aiming to modify hard indicators such as incidence, mortality rates, and survival at a population scale. Based on these concepts, organized national cancer programs appeared in several countries in the second half of the 20th century. But at the same time, scientific efforts began to modify the landscape of cancer control. Evidence of mortality reductions began to appear, cancer-driving mutations became measurable, many novel drugs were registered, the methodology of clinical trials spread through health systems, targeted drugs and immunotherapy entered into the mainstream of therapeutics, and treatment goals started to shift from cure to chronic control. The implementation and impact of organized interventions for cancer control show variations according to the context of diverse countries, and scientists and health decision makers can learn from studying these diverse experiences. Among the salient features of cancer control in Cuba are the simultaneous development of a primary care network with abundant human resources and a national biotechnology industry with capacity to provide both generic and innovating drugs and diagnostic systems. The program intentionally assumes the goal of accelerating the transformation of advanced cancer into a chronic disease susceptible of long-term control. The implications of this strategy for population interventions and for scientific research are discussed.",

     "abstract": "One of the most known oncogenes is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family. It activates multiple signaling cascades that promote carcinogenesis and immune evasion. Therefore, these molecules have been extensively targeted in cancer immunotherapy. Beyond EGFR signaling cascade inhibition, some of these agents are able to induce T-cell activation, transforming a passive therapy into a vaccine-like effect. Nimotuzumab is an IgG1 humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular domain of the EGFR blocking the binding to its ligands. It possesses unique pharmacodynamic properties, which allow treating patients for long-term periods and with very low toxicity. Based on its clinical effect, nimotuzumab has been approved in Cuba and abroad for the treatment of different epithelial tumors. Recently, new potential mechanisms of action of nimotuzumab involving the activation of the innate and adaptive immune response have been reported. This review summarizes the main properties of nimotuzumab in comparison with other EGFR-specific monoclonal antibodies, highlighting its capacity to activate an effective immune response. In addition, differential clinical effects of this antibody and ongoing clinical trials to deeply characterize the biomarkers of clinical benefit are shown.",

After preclinical studies, two sequential phase 1 clinical trials were conducted with HEBERSaVax to assess safety, tolerance, and immunogenicity in patients with advanced solid tumors, at different antigen doses, and combined with two distinct adjuvants. HEBERSaVax was found to be safe and tolerable, with mainly low-grade local adverse effects. Immunized patients produced specific anti-VEGF IgG antibodies that blocked VEGF-VEGF Receptor 2 (KDR) interaction in an in vitro competitive ELISA assay. Gamma-IFN ELISPOT tests done with patient samples were positive after in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with a mutated VEGF molecule.

In these indications, IL2 induces long lasting objective responses in 5% to 20% of patients.

At the Center of Molecular Immunology in Havana, Cuba, a project was launched in 2005 to rationally design IL2 muteins that could be deployed in the therapy of cancer. The basic goal was to uncouple the pleiotropic effect of IL2 on different immune T cells, to obtain a mutein with a therapeutic index that was better than that achieved with wild type (wt) IL2. Using a combination of computational and experimental biology approaches, we predicted and developed two novel IL2 muteins with therapeutic potential. The first, designated no-alpha mutein, is an agonist of IL2R signaling with a reduced ability to expand Treg in vivo. In mice, the no-alpha mutein IL2 has higher antitumor activity and lower toxicity than wt IL2. It represents a potential best-in-class drug that has begun phase I/II clinical trials in solid tumors. The second, designated no-gamma mutein, is an antagonist of IL2R signaling, with some preferential affinity for Tregs. This mutein has antitumor activity in mice that likely derives from its ability to reduce Treg accumulation in vivo. It represents a first-in-class drug that offers a novel strategy to inhibit Treg activity in vivo.",

Preclinical evidence demonstrated that derangements of cyclin D1, CDK4/6, and retinoblastoma expression are common in breast cancer, and suggested a therapeutic benefit from interrupting this axis required for cell cycle progression. Studies of cell lines and animal models of breast cancer have demonstrated the complex interplay between the cell cycle and estrogen receptor and human epidermal growth receptor 2 signaling, which informs our understanding of synergistic use of CDK4/6 inhibitors with endocrine therapy, as well as mechanisms of resistance to endocrine therapy. Interestingly, estrogen receptor activity leads to upregulation of cyclin D1 expression, but the estrogen receptor is also in turn activated by cyclin D1, independent of estrogen binding. Early CDK inhibitors were nonspecific and limited by systemic toxicities, while the current generation of CDK4/6 inhibitors have shown promise in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.

The promise of convenient non-invasive access to the complex and dynamic molecular features of cancer through peripheral blood has galvanized translational researchers around this topic with compelling routes to clinical implementation, particularly in the post-treatment surveillance setting. Although analysis methods must contend with the small quantities of ctDNA present in most patients, and the relative over-abundance of background cfDNA derived from normal tissues, recent technical innovations have led to dramatic improvements in the sensitivity of ctDNA detection. As a result, ever more studies are investigating the clinical utility of ctDNA for applications in (1) treatment response assessment, (2) identification of emerging resistance mechanisms, (3) minimal residual disease detection, and (4) characterization of clonal heterogeneity and selection. In this review, we describe the detection methods currently used in clinical studies to assess low fractions of ctDNA, as well as their utility in the applications previously described. Finally, we address current limitations that have hampered the clinical implementation of ctDNA analysis for post-treatment surveillance and propose steps that could be made to address them.",

     "abstract": "Lysosomes are important cytoplasmic organelles whose critical functions in cells are increasingly being understood. In particular, despite the long-standing accepted concept about the role of lysosomes as cellular machineries solely assigned to degradation, it has been demonstrated that they play active roles in homeostasis and even in cancer biology. Indeed, it is now well documented that during the process of cellular transformation and cancer progression lysosomes are changing localization, composition, and volume and, through the release of their enzymes, lysosomes can also enhance cancer aggressiveness. LAMPs (lysosome associated membrane proteins) represent a family of glycosylated proteins present predominantly on the membrane of lysosomes whose expression can vary among different tissues, suggesting a separation of functions. In this review we focus on the functions and roles of the different LAMP family members, with a particular emphasis on cancer progression and metastatic spread. LAMP proteins are involved in many different aspects of cell biology and can influence cellular processes such as phagocytosis, autophagy, lipid transport, and aging. Interestingly, for all the five members identified so far (LAMP1, LAMP2, LAMP3, CD68/Macrosialin/LAMP4, and BAD-LAMP/LAMP5), a role in cancer has been suggested. While this is well documented for LAMP1 and LAMP2, the involvement of the other three proteins in cancer progression and aggressiveness has recently been proposed and remains to be elucidated. Here we present different examples about how LAMP proteins can influence and support tumor growth and metastatic spread, emphasizing the impact of each single member of the family.",

Regarding the latter, incidence can be linked to mutations in high- or low-penetrance genes. The most relevant risk factor for the development of male breast cancer is a mutation in the BRCA2 gene. Most cases present late because of a lack of awareness of the existence of such a malignancy in males and ignorance of the related risk factors.

     "abstract": "Glucose is a key metabolite used by cancer cells to generate ATP, maintain redox state and create biomass. Glucose can be catabolized to lactate in the cytoplasm, which is termed glycolysis, or alternatively can be catabolized to carbon dioxide and water in the mitochondria via oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic heterogeneity exists in a subset of human tumors, with some cells maintaining a glycolytic phenotype while others predominantly utilize oxidative phosphorylation. Cells within tumors interact metabolically with transfer of catabolites from supporting stromal cells to adjacent cancer cells. The Reverse Warburg Effect describes when glycolysis in the cancer-associated stroma metabolically supports adjacent cancer cells. This catabolite transfer, which induces stromal-cancer metabolic coupling, allows cancer cells to generate ATP, increase proliferation, and reduce cell death. Catabolites implicated in metabolic coupling include the monocarboxylates lactate, pyruvate, and ketone bodies. Monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) are critically necessary for release and uptake of these catabolites. MCT4 is involved in the release of monocarboxylates from cells, is regulated by catabolic transcription factors such as hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1A) and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), and is highly expressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts. Conversely, MCT1 is predominantly involved in the uptake of these catabolites and is highly expressed in a subgroup of cancer cells. MYC and TIGAR, which are genes involved in cellular proliferation and anabolism, are inducers of MCT1. Profiling human tumors on the basis of an altered redox balance and intra-tumoral metabolic interactions may have important biomarker and therapeutic implications. Alterations in the redox state and mitochondrial function of cells can induce metabolic coupling. Hence, there is interest in redox and metabolic modulators as anticancer agents. Also, markers of metabolic coupling have been associated with poor outcomes in numerous human malignancies and may be useful prognostic and predictive biomarkers.",

We investigated the metabolic phenotypes of human DLBCL tumors by using immunohistochemical markers of glycolytic and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism. The lactate importer MCT4 is a marker of glycolysis, whereas the lactate importer MCT1 and TOMM20 are markers of OXPHOS metabolism. Staining patterns were assessed in 33 DLBCL samples as well as 18 control samples (non-neoplastic lymph nodes). TOMM20 and MCT1 were highly expressed in neoplastic lymphocytes, indicating an OXPHOS phenotype, whereas non-neoplastic lymphocytes in the control samples did not express these markers. Stromal cells in DLBCL samples strongly expressed MCT4, displaying a glycolytic phenotype, a feature not seen in stromal elements of non-neoplastic lymphatic tissue. Furthermore, the differential expression of lactate exporters (MCT4) on tumor-associated stroma and lactate importers (MCT1) on neoplastic lymphocytes support the hypothesis that neoplastic cells are metabolically linked to the stroma likely via mutually beneficial reprogramming. MCT4 is a marker of tumor-associated stroma in neoplastic tissue. Our findings suggest that disruption of neoplastic-stromal cell metabolic heterogeneity including MCT1 and MCT4 blockade should be studied to determine if it could represent a novel treatment target in DLBCL.",

     "abstract": "Twenty percent of patients with classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) have aggressive disease defined as relapsed or refractory disease to initial therapy. At present we cannot identify these patients pre-treatment. The microenvironment is very important in cHL because non-cancer cells constitute the majority of the cells in these tumors. Non-cancer intra-tumoral cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been shown to promote tumor growth in cHL via crosstalk with the cancer cells. Metabolic heterogeneity is defined as high mitochondrial metabolism in some tumor cells and glycolysis in others. We hypothesized that there are metabolic differences between cancer cells and non-cancer tumor cells, such as TAMs and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in cHL and that greater metabolic differences between cancer cells and TAMs are associated with poor outcomes.A case-control study was conducted with 22 tissue samples of cHL at diagnosis from a single institution. The case samples were from 11 patients with aggressive cHL who had relapsed after standard treatment with adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) or were refractory to this treatment. The control samples were from 11 patients with cHL who achieved a remission and never relapsed after ABVD. Reactive non-cancerous lymph nodes from four subjects served as additional controls. Samples were stained by immunohistochemistry for three metabolic markers: translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 20 (TOMM20), monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), and monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4). TOMM20 is a marker of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) metabolism. Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) is the main importer of lactate into cells and is a marker of OXPHOS. Monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) is the main lactate exporter out of cells and is a marker of glycolysis. The immunoreactivity for TOMM20, MCT1, and MCT4 was scored based on staining intensity and percentage of positive cells, as follows:\u00a00 for no detectable staining in > 50% of cells; 1+ for faint to moderate staining in > 50% of cells, and 2+ for high or strong staining in > 50% of cells.TOMM20, MCT1, and MCT4 expression was significantly different in Hodgkin and Reed Sternberg (HRS) cells, which are the cancerous cells in cHL compared with TAMs and tumor-associated lymphocytes. HRS have high expression of TOMM20 and MCT1, while TAMs have absent expression of TOMM20 and MCT1 in all but two cases. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes have low TOMM20 expression and absent MCT1 expression. Conversely, high MCT4 expression was found in TAMs, but absent in HRS cells in all but one case. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes had absent MCT4 expression. Reactive lymph nodes in contrast to cHL tumors had low TOMM20, MCT1, and MCT4 expression in lymphocytes and macrophages. High TOMM20 and MCT1 expression in cancer cells with high MCT4 expression in TAMs is a signature of high metabolic heterogeneity between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. A high metabolic heterogeneity signature was associated with relapsed or refractory cHL with a hazard ratio of 5.87 (1.16\u201329.71; two-sided P < .05) compared with the low metabolic heterogeneity signature.Aggressive cHL exhibits features of metabolic heterogeneity with high mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells and high glycolysis in TAMs, which is not seen in reactive lymph nodes. Future studies will need to confirm the value of these markers as prognostic and predictive biomarkers in clinical practice. Treatment intensity may be tailored in the future to the metabolic profile of the tumor microenvironment and drugs that target metabolic heterogeneity may be valuable in this disease.",

     "abstract": "High oxidative stress as defined by hydroxyl and peroxyl activity is often found in the stroma of human breast cancers. Oxidative stress induces stromal catabolism, which promotes cancer aggressiveness. Stromal cells exposed to oxidative stress release catabolites such as lactate, which are up-taken by cancer cells to support mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. The transfer of catabolites between stromal and cancer cells leads to metabolic heterogeneity between these cells and increased cancer cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis in preclinical models. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress and reverses stromal catabolism and stromal-carcinoma cell metabolic heterogeneity, resulting in reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of cancer cells in experimental models of breast cancer. The purpose of this clinical trial was to determine if NAC could reduce markers of stromal-cancer metabolic heterogeneity and markers of cancer cell aggressiveness in human breast cancer.Subjects with newly diagnosed stage 0 and I breast cancer who were not going to receive neoadjuvant therapy prior to surgical resection were treated with NAC before definitive surgery to assess intra-tumoral metabolic markers. NAC was administered once a week intravenously at a dose of 150 mg/kg and 600 mg twice daily orally on the days not receiving intravenous NAC. Histochemistry for the stromal metabolic markers monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) and caveolin-1 (CAV1) and the Ki67 proliferation assay and TUNEL apoptosis assay in carcinoma cells were performed in pre- and post-NAC specimens.The range of days on NAC was 14\u201327 and the mean was 19 days. Post-treatment biopsies showed significant decrease in stromal MCT4 and reduced Ki67 in carcinoma cells. NAC did not significantly change stromal CAV1 and carcinoma TUNEL staining. NAC was well tolerated.NAC as a single agent reduces MCT4 stromal expression, which is a marker of glycolysis in breast cancer with reduced carcinoma cell proliferation.

However, in selected circumstances, first-line systemic treatment may be more appropriate in order to avoid neurocognitive toxicities, and potential options should be evaluated in window of opportunity trials.

While 80%\u201390% of patients diagnosed with ALL will achieve complete remission at some point during treatment, ALL is associated with high relapse rate, with a 5-year overall survival rate of 68%. The initial remission failure and the high rate of relapse can be attributed to intrinsic chemoprotective mechanisms that allow persistence of ALL cells despite therapy. These mechanisms are mediated, at least in part, through the engagement of cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) within the bone marrow microenvironment. This review assembles CAMs implicated in protection of leukemic cells from chemotherapy. Such studies are limited in ALL. Therefore, CAMs that are associated with poor outcomes or are overexpressed in ALL and have been shown to be involved in chemoprotection in other hematological cancers are also included. It is likely that these molecules play parallel roles in ALL because the CAMs identified to be a factor in ALL chemoresistance also work similarly in other hematological malignancies. We review the signaling mechanisms activated by the engagement of CAMs that provide protection from chemotherapy. Development of targeted therapies against CAMs could improve outcome and raise the overall cure rate in ALL.",

Nivolumab and pembrolizumab work by interfering with the interaction between PD-1 and programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), whose unimpeded interaction downregulates T cells allowing cancer cells to evade immune surveillance. These drugs have earned a series of FDA approvals for melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC), urothelial cancer, classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and renal cell cancer. In this review we will summarize the data for efficacy and toxicity for these two agents. We conclude that they represent two valuable but interchangeable alternatives to target their approved indications. We will discuss how this can help global payers seeking to contain the cost of cancer therapeutics that continues to spiral out of control.",

     "abstract": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a relatively rare and heterogeneous group of neoplasms with an annual incidence of ~35 cases per 100,000 people in the United States. The updated World Health Organization (WHO) classification system of gastroenteropancreatic (GEP)-NETs categorizes these tumors according to site of origin, clinical syndrome, and degree of differentiation. Well-differentiated NETs arising from the gastrointestinal tract or lungs (formerly known as carcinoid tumors) are often indolent and slow-growing. In contrast, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs) are aggressive and have a poor prognosis. Due to their insidious onset, most NETs are diagnosed at an advanced stage and a curative approach is not possible. In these patients, medical therapy is limited to disease control, including relief of symptoms that arise from overproduction of peptide hormones by the tumors. Somatostatin analogues (SSAs) have remained the mainstay of symptoms control. In addition to symptoms control, clinical data also support an anti-proliferative effect of SSAs in patients with well- to moderately differentiated NETs. Long-acting SSAs have greatly facilitated their use. This review will focus on two long-acting SSAs, octreotide LAR and lanreotide, and their use in the clinical setting. Information necessary to assess their relative merits is summarized. We conclude these two therapies are interchangeable making value a very important consideration in their use.",

We describe the findings of a pooled analysis of three clinical trials submitted to the US Food and Drug administration (FDA) where treatment of patients with mNSCLC permitted TPP in terms of reduction in the sum of target lesions following initial RECIST-defined progression. We identified patients who received TPP and the characteristics and post-TPP change in tumor burden. All patients had advanced or mNSCLC and had previously received a platinum-based doublet regimen. In total, 535 patients were treated with anti\u2013PD-1 therapy in three clinical trials of which 121 patients (23%) received TPP. Among all 535 patients treated with anti\u2013PD-1 therapy, the partial response (PR) rate (\u226530% reduction in the size of target lesions compared to baseline) following TPP was 1.9% (10 of 535) or 8.3% (10 of 121) in the TPP subgroup. Patients who responded to TPP were more likely to have responded to the initial course of anti\u2013PD-1 therapy, prior to progression. The subgroup of patients who received TPP appeared to have similar baseline characteristics and response to initial treatment compared to the overall population. This suggests that a treatment strategy that includes TPP may not benefit the overall population. The risks of TPP should be weighed against the low likelihood of a PR and the potential for changing to a different therapy with a higher likelihood of benefit.",

We sought to determine the annual US incidence, 5-year survival, and number of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-recommended regimens for indications described in the literature as an \u201cunmet medical need.\u201d We queried Google Scholar to identify publications where authors used the phrase \u201cunmet medical need\u201d to refer to a specific cancer indication. For each indication, we investigated the annual US incidence, 5-year survival, and number of NCCN recommended regimens. We identified 237 cancer indications considered by authors an \u201cunmet medical need.\u201d The term was found most frequently appended to breast cancer indications comprising 30 of the 237 citations (12.7%).

In 55 of 237 (23.2%) instances where an indication was described by the authors as an unmet medical need, the incidence was 1,000 cases per year, there were five regimens recommended by NCCN, and there was a 50% or greater 5-year survival. Forty-three of 237 (18.1%) indications had at least an incidence of 10,000 cases a year, 10 recommended regimens, and a 50% 5-year survival. In conclusion, \u201cunmet medical need\u201d has been used to describe cancer indications that are rare, and have few options and poor survival outcomes. However, the term has also been used to describe indications that occur commonly, have many treatment alternatives, and are clinically indolent with more encouraging expectations for survival.

This multicenter prospective cohort study aimed to assess the clinical benefit of pretherapeutic screening for DPD deficiency using a multiparametric approach. Two parallel cohorts of patients treated with 5-FU\u2013based chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma were compared in a prospective nonrandomized study. In arm A, patients had DPD deficiency screening before treatment, whereas in arm B no pretherapy screening was performed. Dosing was based on 5-FU administration guidelines of each institution. DPD deficiency screening was performed using a combined multiparametric approach (5-FUODPM Tox). The frequency of early grade 4\u20135 toxic events potentially induced by 5-FU was compared in the two groups. At total of 1,142 patients (n = 1,116 evaluable) were enrolled. In arm A, out of 718 evaluable patients, nine grade 4 early toxicities potentially related to 5-FU were reported in nine patients (1.2%) with no toxic death despite one complete DPD deficiency and 24 partial deficiencies. The 24 patients with partial deficiency had safe pharmacokinetics (PK)-monitored 5-FU. In arm B, among 398 evaluable patients, 17 grade 4\u20135 toxic early events potentially related to 5-FU were reported in 12 patients (4.2%). The incidence of early severe toxicity was significantly higher in arm B (P = .0019), confirming the positive impact of pretherapeutic DPD assessment. The percent of patients with a toxicity grade 3 or higher observed in arm A\u00a0was 10.8% (n = 78) compared to 17.55% (n = 69)\u00a0 in arm B (P = .0497). The percentage of death was reduced from 2.5/1,000 in arm B to 0 in arm A. The time to occurrence of all grade \u22653 toxicities was determined in both arms and the difference between the two arms was significant (P = .047). Overall, one patient with complete DPD deficiency confirmed retrospectively died within 13 days from grade 5 multivisceral toxicity. Enrollment was prematurely closed after external experts\u2019 decision. In conclusion, multiparametric pretherapeutic DPD deficiency screening significantly lowered the risk of early severe toxicity and avoided an early toxic death.

Patients were stratified by their pharmacogenetic/phenotypic status: the irinotecan dose was adjusted according to the number of TA tandem repeats in the UGT1A1 promoter, while the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) dose was initially adjusted according to dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) activity at initial screening (5-FUODPM Tox) followed by PK-guided dose optimization (5-FUODPM Protocol). An advanced cetuximab PK/pharmacodynamics (PD) study was performed but dosage remained unchanged. Eighty-five patients receiving second-line chemotherapy were enrolled. Mean irinotecan doses at 3 months were 247 \u00b1 50, 210 \u00b1 53 and 140 \u00b1 21 mg/m2 for those with 6/6 (33), 6/7 (26), and 7/7 (7) TATA repeats in the UGT1A1 promoter region, respectively. The 5-FU dose was initially reduced in four patients with DPD deficiency, but mean 5-FU dose at 3 months was 2,412 \u00b1 364 mg/m2 (1,615\u20133,170 mg/m2). Grade 4 toxicities were not encountered and grade 4 neutropenia occurred in 6.8%, 5.9%, and 0% of patients with 6/6, 6/7, and 7/7 UGT1A1 genotypes. The objective response rate was 25.8% among the 85 patients, 57.3% in patients with tumors wild type (WT) for KRAS, and 25% in those whose tumor harbored a mutant-KRAS. Secondary resection of hepatic metastases was performed in 31.7% of patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for all 85 patients was 181 days and 200, 132, and 121 days for patients with 6/6, 6/7, and 7/7 UGT1A1 genotypes, respectively; these differences were not statistically different. In parallel, a strong relationship was shown between cetuximab AUC and regimen efficacy. We conclude that personalized drug tailoring when administering in FOLFIRI + cetuximab allows for safe and efficient individual dose intensification.",

The differences in the median PFS and OS for the unfunded medicines, relative to the comparator medicine funded in NZ, were then assessed against the American Society of Clinical Oncology Cancer Research Committee (ASCO-CRC) recommended targets for clinically meaningful health gains. Our analysis confirms that, whilst New Zealand funds fewer cancer medicines than Australia, most of the additional medicines funded in Australia do not deliver clinically meaningful health gains as defined by the ASCO-CRC guidance. This suggests that New Zealand is not missing substantive opportunities for improvements to New Zealand\u2019s cancer survival rates through additional medicines funding. A policy of funding more new cancer medicines in order to achieve numerical parity with Australia or other countries would not result in substantive health improvement and would cost significantly more, and investing the millions of dollars needed to achieve funding parity with other countries would not represent good value for money in terms of delivering the best health outcomes for all New Zealanders, rather selective funding of new medicines that demonstrate clear clinical benefit and that are cost-effective and affordable is the sensible approach.",

The MEDLINE database was searched using PubMed in order to find relevant studies on the use of NOACs in patients with active malignancy and VTE. Furthermore, critical reading of references in recently published studies and reviews was performed. NOACs appear to be at least equivalent to coumarin anticoagulants in terms of efficacy and safety and their administration is easier, but data specifically concerning patients with active malignancy or comparing them to LMWH in this specific clinical setting are not yet available. Furthermore, patients with active cancer present several unique characteristics and drawing conclusions from studies involving other patient groups may not be appropriate. Specific studies in cancer patients are still pending that will help decide if NOACs will be the drugs of choice in this group of patients in need of efficient and simple to administer treatments.",

When performing the review of existing data and when writing this paper it became clear to me that both KRd and bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (RVd) are both recommended by established, well-respected expert guidelines. Importantly, the actual data behind guidelines supporting KRd and RVd come from phase II studies; thus, the level of scientific evidence behind KRd and RVd is the same. When reviewing efficacy and safety data for both regimens, I conclude that published peer-reviewed KRd original data are well in line with modern treatment goals for newly diagnosed MM patients: rapid, deep, and sustainable treatment effect with limited toxicity. Taken together, available scientific and clinical evidence favors KRd as the new default therapy for fit patients with a new diagnosis of MM. Original data support KRd independent of cytogenetic risk status; indeed, patients with standard-risk disease (which represents 75% of all newly diagnosed MM patients) have the strongest benefit of KRd.",

A significant proportion of men report having a positive family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative (father, brother, son), which is important in that family history is one of the only established risk factors for the disease and plays a role in decision-making for prostate cancer screening. Familial aggregation of prostate cancer is considered a surrogate marker of genetic susceptibility to developing the disease, but shared environment cannot be excluded as an explanation for clustering of cases among family members. Prostate cancer is both a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease with inherited factors predicted to account for 40%\u201350% of cases, comprised of both rare highly to moderately penetrant gene variants, as well as common genetic variants of low penetrance. Most notably, HOXB13 and BRCA2 mutations have been consistently shown to increase prostate cancer risk, and are more commonly observed among patients diagnosed with early-onset disease. A recurrent mutation in HOXB13 has been shown to predispose to hereditary prostate cancer (HPC), and BRCA2 mutations to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have also identified approximately 100 loci that associate with modest (odds ratios <2.0) increases in prostate cancer risk, only some of which have been replicated in subsequent studies. Despite these efforts, genetic testing in prostate cancer lags behind other common tumors like breast and colorectal cancer. To date, National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines have highly selective criteria for BRCA1/2 testing for men with prostate cancer based on personal history and/or specific family cancer history. Tumor sequencing is also leading to the identification of germline mutations in prostate cancer patients, informing the scope of inheritance. Advances in genetic testing for inherited and familial prostate cancer (FPC) are needed to inform personalized cancer risk screening and treatment approaches.",

Although DNA and RNA analyses have been used extensively to identify novel targets and patients likely to benefit from targeted therapies, these are indirect measures of the levels and functions of most therapeutic targets. More importantly, DNA and RNA analysis is ill-suited for determining the pharmacodynamic effects of target inhibition. Assessing changes in protein levels and function is the most efficient way to evaluate the mechanisms underlying sensitivity and resistance to targeted agents. Understanding these mechanisms is necessary to identify patients likely to benefit from treatment and to develop rational drug combinations to prevent or bypass therapeutic resistance. There is an urgent need for a robust approach to assess protein levels and protein function in model systems and across patient samples. While \u201cshot gun\u201d mass spectrometry can provide in-depth analysis of proteins across a limited number of samples, and emerging approaches such as multiple reaction monitoring have the potential to analyze candidate markers, mass spectrometry has not entered into general use because of the high cost, requirement of extensive analysis and support, and relatively large amount of material needed for analysis. Rather, antibody-based technologies, including immunohistochemistry, radioimmunoassays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and more recently protein arrays, remain the most common approaches for multiplexed protein analysis. Reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) technology has emerged as a robust, sensitive, cost-effective approach to the analysis of large numbers of samples for quantitative assessment of key members of functional pathways that are affected by tumor-targeting therapeutics. The RPPA platform is a powerful approach for identifying and validating targets, classifying tumor subsets, assessing pharmacodynamics, and identifying prognostic and predictive markers, adaptive responses and rational drug combinations in model systems and patient samples. Its greatest utility has been realized through integration with other analytic platforms such as DNA sequencing, transcriptional profiling, epigenomics, mass spectrometry, and metabolomics. The power of the technology is becoming apparent through its use in pathology laboratories and integration into trial design and implementation.",

     "abstract": "Robust pharmacodynamic assay results are valuable for informing go/no\u2010go decisions about continued development of new anti-cancer agents and for identifying combinations of targeted agents, but often pharmacodynamic results are too incomplete or variable to fulfill this role. Our experience suggests that variable reagent and specimen quality are two major contributors to this problem. Minimizing all potential sources of variability in procedures for specimen collection, processing, and assay measurements is essential for meaningful comparison of pharmacodynamic biomarkers across sample time points. This is especially true in the evaluation of pre- and post-dose tumor biopsies, which suffer from high levels of tumor insufficiency due to variations in biopsy collection techniques and significant specimen heterogeneity within and across patients. Developing methods to assess heterogeneous biopsies is necessary in order to evaluate a majority of tumor biopsies collected for pharmacodynamic biomarker studies. Improved collection devices and standardization of methods are being sought in order to improve the tumor content and quality of tumor biopsies. In terms of reagent variability, we have found that stringent initial reagent qualification and quality control of R&D-grade reagents is critical to minimize lot-to-lot variability and prevent assay failures, especially for clinical pharmacodynamic questions, which often demand assay performance that meets or exceeds clinical diagnostic assay standards. Rigorous reagent specifications and use of appropriate assay quality control methodologies help to ensure consistency between assay runs, laboratories and trials to provide much needed pharmacodynamic insights into the activity of investigational agents.",

     "abstract": "Immunotherapy has become a major modality of cancer treatment, with multiple new classes of immunotherapeutics recently entering the clinic and obtaining market approval from regulatory agencies. While the promise of these therapies is great, so is the number of possible combinations not only with each other but also with small molecule therapeutics. Furthermore, the observation of unusual dose-response relationships suggests a critical dependency of drug effectiveness on the dosage regimen (dose and schedule). Clinical pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers will be useful endpoints for confirming drug mechanism of action, evaluating combination therapies for synergy or antagonism, and identifying optimal dosage regimens. In contrast to conventional PD in which drug action occurs entirely within a single target cell (ie, is self-contained within the malignant cell), immunotherapy involves a complex mechanism of action with sequential steps that propagate through multiple cell types, both normal and malignant. Its intercellular pharmacology begins with molecular target engagement either on an immune effector cell or a malignant cell, followed by stimulatory biochemical and biological signals in immune effector cells, and then finally ends with activation of cell death mechanisms in malignant cells lying within a certain distance from the activated effector cells (immune cell\u2013tumor cell proximity). Evaluating such \u201ctrans-cellular pharmacology,\u201d in which different steps of drug action are distributed across multiple cell types, requires novel microscopy and image analysis tools capable of quantifying PD-biomarker responses, mapping the responses onto the cellular geography of the tumor using phenotypic biomarkers to identify specific cell types, and finally analyzing the spatial relationships between biomarkers in the context of each cell\u2019s biological role. We have termed this form of nearest neighbor image analysis of drug action \u201cproximity PD microscopy,\u201d to indicate the importance of the location of the PD-biomarker response within the cellular landscape of a tumor specimen. We discuss herein the major modes of immunotherapy, and lay out a blueprint for using PD assessment to optimize dosage regimens of single agents and guide development of combination immunotherapy regimens, using PD1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibition as a case study.",

In addition, we discuss how MOA-based PD biomarker analyses can be used both as patient selection diagnostic tools and for designing novel drug combinations targeting the specific mutational signature of a given malignancy. We also describe the role of PD analyses in clinical trials, including for MOA confirmation and dosage regimen optimization during phase 0 trials as well as for correlating molecular changes with clinical efficacy when establishing proof-of-concept in phase I/II trials.

     "abstract": "The recent discovery of genes mutated in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) has stimulated new research into the role of these genes in CLL pathogenesis. CLL cases carry approximately 5\u201320 mutated genes per exome, a lower number than detected in many human tumors. Of the recurrently mutated genes in CLL, all are mutated in 10% or less of patients when assayed in unselected CLL cohorts at diagnosis. Mutations in TP53 are of major clinical relevance, are often associated with del17p and gain in frequency over time. TP53 mutated and associated del17p states substantially lower response rates, remission duration, and survival in CLL. Mutations in NOTCH1 and SF3B1 are recurrent, often associated with progressive CLL that is also IgVH unmutated and ZAP70-positive and are under investigation as targets for novel therapies and as factors influencing CLL outcome. There are an estimated 20\u201350 additional mutated genes with frequencies of 1%\u20135% in CLL; more work is needed to identify these and to study their significance. Finally, of the major biological aberration categories influencing CLL as a disease, gene mutations will need to be placed into context with regard to their ultimate role and importance. Such calibrated appreciation necessitates studies incorporating multiple CLL driver aberrations into biological and clinical analyses.",

     "abstract": "There is considerable heterogeneity in the clinical outcome of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). While some patients live for decades without any therapy, others die within years of diagnosis despite multiple treatments. To better counsel newly diagnosed CLL patients about their disease course, the Rai and Binet staging systems were developed four decades ago. A deeper understanding of the biologic and molecular aberrations contributing to the pathogenesis of CLL led to identification of novel prognostic markers such as immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable gene (IGHV) mutation status, leukemia-cell expression of CD38, ZAP-70, and CD49d, and cytogenetic abnormalities detected by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The advent of next-generation sequencing has provided unprecedented insights into the subclonal architecture of CLL and its impact on disease progression and survival. More recently, integrated prognostic scoring systems that incorporate clinical, biologic and genetic characteristics into a single risk score have been developed and appear to improve the accuracy of prognostication for individual patients. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art prognostic factors and will guide the practicing clinician in their care of patients with CLL.",

Additionally, many of these therapies have a high rate of infectious toxicity in a population already at increased risk. Targeting the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway has emerged as a promising therapeutic advance in a variety of B-cell malignancies, including CLL. Bruton agammaglobulinemia tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a tyrosine kinase in the BCR pathway critical to the survival of both normal and malignant B cells and inhibition of this kinase has shown to block the progression of CLL.

While CDKs do play critical roles in cell cycle, including in cancer, the study of CDK inhibitors in the relatively non-proliferative disease chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) revealed alternate mechanisms both for CDKs, as well as for the role of CDK inhibitors in cancer therapy. In this review, we will consider three CDK inhibitors: alvocidib (flavopiridol), dinaciclib, and TG02.

Two biomarkers (NOTCH1 mutations and subset 8 configuration of the B-cell receptor) may help identifying CLL patients at risk of RS to be considered for close monitoring and a careful biopsy policy. In the presence of clinical features suspicious of RS, diagnosis of transformation and choice of the site of biopsy may take advantage of fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT). Molecular lesions of regulators of tumor suppression (TP53), cell cycle (CDKN2A), and cell proliferation (NOTCH1, MYC) overall account for ~90% of RS and may be responsible for the aggressive clinical phenotype observed in this disease because of the combined effect of chemoresistance and rapid disease kinetics. The prognosis of RS is generally highly unfavorable. However, the pattern of survival is not homogeneous and the most important prognostic factor is the clonal relationship between the CLL and the aggressive lymphoma clones. Rituximab-containing polychemotherapy represents the backbone for induction treatment in RS. Younger patients who respond to induction therapy should be offered stem cell transplant (SCT) to prolong survival.",

The term \u201cretinoid\u201d includes a handful of endogenous and a large group of synthetic derivatives of vitamin A. These multifunctional lipid-soluble compounds directly regulate target genes of specific biological functions and critical signaling pathways to orchestrate complex functions from vision to development, metabolism, and inflammation. Many of the retinoid activities on the cellular level have been well characterized and translated to the regulation of processes like differentiation and cell death, which play critical roles in the outcome of malignant transformation of tissues. In fact, retinoid-based differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia was one of the first successful examples of molecularly targeted treatment strategies. The selectivity, high receptor binding affinity and the ability of retinoids to directly modulate gene expression programs present a distinct pharmacological opportunity for cancer treatment and prevention. However, to fully exploit their potential, the adverse effects of retinoids must be averted.

     "abstract": "Esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, with a dismal prognosis. It is increasingly recognized that esophageal cancer is a heterogeneous disease. It can be subdivided into two distinct groups: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, based on histological appearance. In the Western world, the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma was considerably higher than esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) until the 1990s when, due to a dramatic increase, the incidence of EA surpassed that of squamous cell carcinoma. EA typically follows a well-established stepwise evolution from chronic inflammation due to reflux esophagitis (RE) that progresses to metaplasia (Barrett\u02bcs esophagus [BE]) to dysplasia, which often culminates in EA. The pathophysiology of EA is complex and involves diverse factors, including gastroesophageal reflux, gastric acid secretion, dysfunction of the antireflux barrier, gastric emptying disturbances, and abnormalities in esophageal defense mechanisms. The current understanding of the etiology of EA is mainly derived from epidemiological studies of risk factors such as cigarette smoking, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disorders (GERD), and low fruit and vegetable consumption. Numerous studies have been done, but the factors that drive the dynamic increase in the incidence of EA remain elusive. The advent of widespread antibiotic use occurred in the 1950s, preceding the surge of EA. Based on this temporal sequence, it has been hypothesized that antibiotics alter the microbiome to which the esophagus is exposed in patients who have GERD and that chronic exposure to this abnormal microbiome (ie, changes in species diversity or abundance) accounts for the increase in EA. If changes in the proposed factors alter the stepwise progression (RE-BE-dysplasia-EA), they may represent potential targets for chemoprevention. New discoveries will help improve our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of these cancers, and aid in finding novel therapeutic targets.",

     "abstract": "It is becoming increasingly clear that microbiota inhabiting our bodies influence cancer predisposition and etiology. In addition to pathogens with oncogenic properties, commensal and symbiotic microbiota have tumor-suppressive properties. Diet and other environmental factors can modulate the abundance of certain members of microbial communities within the gastrointestinal tract and at other anatomical sites. Furthermore, some dietary factors are metabolized by commensal/symbiotic gut microbiota into bioactive food components believed to prevent cancer. For example, dietary fiber undergoes bacterial fermentation in the colon to yield butyrate, which is a short-chain fatty acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that suppresses the viability and growth of colorectal cancer cell lines. A recent study using gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that fiber can protect against colorectal tumorigenesis in a microbiota- and butyrate-dependent manner that involves the Warburg effect. This and other examples suggest that some of the inter-individual variation observed in epidemiology and intervention studies that have investigated associations between diet and cancer risk might be explained by differences in microbiota among the participants.

Despite the strong evidence for a favorable risk-benefit ratio for a number of agents in several common malignancies such as breast and prostate cancer, the public\u2019s attitude toward cancer chemoprevention remains ambivalent, with the issue of toxicity associated with drugs being perceived as the main barrier to widespread use of preventive therapy by high-risk subjects. Among the strategies to overcome such obstacles to preventive therapies, two novel and potentially safer modes of administering agents are discussed in this paper. The first strategy is to lower the dose of drugs that are in common use in the adjuvant setting based on the notion that prevention of cancer cells from developing should require a lower dose than eradicating established tumor cells. A second approach is to adopt an intermittent administration similar to what is used in the chemotherapy setting in an attempt to minimize risks while retaining benefits. This article provides a detailed discussion of the principles and future development of these two approaches in the direction of a precision preventive medicine.",

Sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane], a naturally occurring isothiocyanate produced by cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, is found to be a highly promising chemoprevention agent against not only a variety of cancers such as breast, prostate, colon, skin, lung, stomach or bladder, but also cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. For reasons of experimental exigency, preclinical studies have focused principally on sulforaphane itself, while clinical studies have relied on broccoli sprout preparations rich in either sulforaphane or its biogenic precursor, glucoraphanin. Substantive subsequent evaluation of sulforaphane pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been undertaken using either pure compound or food matrices. Sulforaphane affects multiple targets in cells. One key molecular mechanism of action for sulforaphane entails activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway although other actions contribute to the broad spectrum of efficacy in different animal models. This review summarizes the current status of pre-clinical chemoprevention studies with sulforaphane and highlights the progress and challenges for the application of foods rich in sulforaphane and/or glucoraphanin in the arena of clinical chemoprevention.",

Several FGFR inhibitors are currently under development. Initial preclinical results have translated into limited successful clinical responses when first-generation, nonspecific FGFR inhibitors were evaluated in patients.

Toxicities can be classified as: (1) on-target, mechanism-driven toxicities that are either related or unrelated to response; and (2) off-target side effects. Off-target toxicities may be specific to the class of agent, eg, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor versus antibody versus cytotoxic; alternatively, they may also be mediated by metabolites or immune reactions. Both on- and off-target toxicities can be amplified or attenuated by drug concentrations or end-organ sensitivity, which in turn can be attributable to genetic polymorphisms regulating metabolism or tissue responsiveness. On-target side effects are important to identify as some are associated with response and, therefore, controlling these side effects is preferable to dose reduction or treatment discontinuation. Side effects caused by relevant target impact may be recognized when different types of agents, eg, small molecule inhibitors and antibodies, with the same target have the same side effect. These on-target effects may also correlate with better outcomes.

Even so, the rate of deeper and earlier responses is higher with second-generation TKIs than it is with imatinib, and, in general, better response is associated with a survival advantage, regardless of TKI type being used. Patients should be monitored carefully for response, and treatment failure should prompt a timely switch to another TKI. Side effect profile and drug cost are other important considerations in therapy choice. In several clinical studies, achieving undetectable and durable disease status allowed some patients to discontinue the TKI and enjoy long-term treatment-free remission. Cure for CML may be possible with TKIs alone or TKIs in combination with other investigational therapies.

Recent research has focused on dual blockade of HER2 (trastuzumab-lapatinib; trastuzumab-pertuzumab) and concomitant blockade of the endocrine driver and other pathways such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway (everolimus-exemestane), HER2 (trastuzumab/lapatinib-endocrine therapy) and the cell cycle through cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition (letrozole-palbociclib).

The patient underwent two tumor biopsies: at diagnosis (when calcium levels were normal) and upon development of hypercalcemia and cachexia. PTHrP expression was higher in melanoma cells when hypercalcemia had occurred than prior to its onset. Metabolic characterization of melanoma cells revealed that, with development of hypercalcemia, there was high expression of monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), which is the main importer of lactate and ketone bodies into cells. MCT1 is associated with high mitochondrial metabolism. Beta-galactosidase (\u03b2-GAL), a marker of senescence, had reduced expression in melanoma cells upon development of hypercalcemia compared to pre-hypercalcemia.In conclusion, PTHrP expression in melanoma is associated with cachexia, increased cancer cell lactate and ketone body import, high mitochondrial metabolism, and reduced senescence.

Staining patterns of MCT1 and TOMM20 in 35 human thyroid samples (15 ATC, 12 papillary thyroid cancer [PTC], and eight non-cancerous thyroid) and nine ATC mouse orthotopic xenografts were assessed by visual and Aperio digital scoring. Staining patterns of areas involved with cancer versus areas with no evidence of cancer were evaluated independently where available. MCT1 is highly expressed in human anaplastic thyroid cancer when compared to both non-cancerous thyroid tissues and papillary thyroid cancers (P<.001 for both). TOMM20 is also highly expressed in both ATC and PTC compared to non-cancerous thyroid tissue (P<.01 for both). High MCT1 and TOMM20 expression is also found in ATC mouse xenograft tumors compared to non-cancerous thyroid tissue (P<.001). These xenograft tumors have high 13C- pyruvate uptake. ATC has metabolic features that distinguish it from PTC and non-cancerous thyroid tissue, including high expression of MCT1 and TOMM20.

However, rare cancers show some of the highest response rates to targeted therapies, probably due to identification of oncogenic drivers with little interpatient variability. Although the low incidence of rare cancers makes large-scale randomized trials involving single histologies difficult to perform, drugs have been successfully developed in rare cancers using clinical trial designs that combine microscopic histologies. Such trials are being pursued within the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), which possesses unique qualifications to perform widespread molecular screening of tumors for patient enrollment onto therapeutic clinical trials. When larger clinical trials are needed to determine optimum treatment strategies in rare cancers, the NCTN\u2019s broad reach in North America and internationally, and their ability to partner with both United States\u2013based and international research organizations, can make these challenging studies feasible.",

     "abstract": "A number of consensuses regarding cancer immunology have recently emerged from both preclinical immunotherapy models and analysis of cancer patients. First and foremost, the natural state of endogenous tumor reactive T cells is characterized by general hyporesponsiveness or anergy. This is likely due to a number of mechanisms that tumors use to induce tolerance as they develop. While many of the newer generation vaccines can effectively transfer antigen to and activate dendritic cells, T-cell tolerance remains a major barrier that is difficult to overcome by vaccination alone. Preclinical models demonstrate that for poorly immunogenic tumors, once tolerance has been established, therapeutic vaccines alone are ineffective at curing animals with a significant established tumor burden. However, combination strategies of vaccination together with inhibitors of immunologic checkpoints and agonists for co-stimulatory pathways are proving capable of overcoming tolerance and generating significant anti-tumor responses even in cases of established metastatic cancer.",

The horizon of immune-based therapies in hematologic malignancies is rapidly expanding with promising results from immune-modulatory drugs, immune-checkpoint blockade, and adoptive cellular therapies, including genetically-modified T cells. Hematologic malignancies present distinct issues (relative to solid tumors) for the application of immune therapies due to differences in cell of origin/developmental niche of tumor cells, and patterns of involvement such as common systemic involvement of secondary lymphoid tissues.

     "abstract": "T and natural killer (NK) lymphocytes are considered the main effector players in the immune response against tumors. Full activation of T and NK lymphocytes requires the coordinated participation of several surface receptors that meet their cognate ligands through structured transient cell-to-cell interactions known as immune synapses. In the case of T cells, the main route of stimulation is driven by antigens as recognized in the form of short polypeptides associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen-presenting molecules. However, the functional outcome of T-cell stimulation towards clonal expansion and effector function acquisition is contingent on the contact of additional surface receptor-ligand pairs and on the actions of cytokines in the milieu. While some of those interactions are inhibitory, others are activating and are collectively termed co-stimulatory receptors. The best studied belong to either the immunoglobulin superfamily or the tumor necrosis factor-receptor (TNFR) family. Co-stimulatory receptors include surface moieties that are constitutively expressed on resting lymphocytes such as CD28 or CD27 and others whose expression is induced upon recent previous antigen priming, ie, CD137, GITR, OX40, and ICOS. Ligation of these glycoproteins with agonist antibodies actively conveys activating signals to the lymphocyte. Those signals, acting through a potentiation of the cellular immune response, give rise to anti-tumor effects in mouse models. Anti-CD137 antibodies are undergoing clinical trials with evidence of clinical activity and anti-OX40 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) induce interesting immunomodulation effects in humans. Antibodies anti-CD27 and GITR have recently entered clinical trials. The inherent dangers of these immunomodulation strategies are the precipitation of excessive systemic inflammation or/and invigorating silent autoimmunity. Agonist antibodies, recombinant forms of the natural ligands, and polynucleotide-based aptamers constitute the pharmacologic tools to manipulate such receptors. Preclinical data suggest that the greatest potential of these agents is achieved in combined treatment strategies.",

This phenotype has positive prognostic value for several types of early stage cancer, suggesting that the attempt by the host to generate an anti-tumor immune response reflects a biologic process associated with improved patient outcomes. In metastatic disease, the presence of this phenotype appears to be associated with clinical response to several immunotherapies, including cancer vaccines, checkpoint blockade, and adoptive T-cell transfer. With the high rate of clinical response to several of these therapies, along with early data indicating that combination immunotherapies may be even more potent, it seems likely that effective immune-based therapies will become a reality for patients with a range of different cancers that physiologically support the T-cell\u2013inflamed tumor microenvironment in a subset of individuals. Therefore, one of the next significant hurdles will be to develop new therapeutic interventions that will enable these immunotherapies to be effective in patients with the non-T-cell\u2013inflamed phenotype.

It is increasingly clear that tumor growth depends on both internal tumor factors, and factors that are external to the tumor, such as microenvironment. We recently showed that parameter values alone are less important than the patterns of all patient parameters together for the identification of prognostic subtypes and have identified a network phenotyping strategy method to quantitatively describe the dependency of the tumor on the environment, to characterize hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) subtypes. We have also shown that information about tumor mass together with patterns of other prognostic factors is related to survival. We now use a different patient cohort to validate this prognostic approach. A main finding is our identification of a common time of total disease duration (TDD) for every HCC patient. Clinical prognosis at the time of baseline patient evaluation is then calculable as the difference between TDD and the time from disease onset to diagnosis (Tonset). We show that the total pattern of all parameter values and the differences in the relationships between this pattern and a reference pattern that, together with the tumor mass, best reflects the patient\u2019s prognosis at baseline. Our approach led us to identify 15 different composite HCC subtypes.

A significant body of data support the critical importance of immune checkpoints in the control of the adaptive immune response to malignancy, and suggest that inhibitors of those checkpoints might have significant utility in treating cancer. This has been borne out by the recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of two different antibodies, one against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and one against programmed death-1 (PD-1). Here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the preclinical justification for the use of CTLA-4 and PD-1 blockade as monotherapy, and as combination therapy in the treatment of cancer. The animal data strongly supported the use of these drugs in patients, and in many cases suggested strategies that directly led to successful registration trials. In contrast, many of the toxicities, and some of the unusual response patterns seen in patients with these drugs, were not predicted by the preclinical work that we cite, highlighting the importance of early-phase trials with patients to inform future drug development. In addition, we review herein the preclinical data surrounding emerging immune checkpoint proteins, including BTLA, VISTA, CD160, LAG3, TIM3, and CD244 as potential targets for inhibition. The current comprehensive review of the literature regarding CTLA-4 and PD-1, as well as a number of novel checkpoint proteins demonstrates a strong preclinical basis for the use of these antibodies singly and in combination to overcome checkpoint inhibition in the treatment of cancer.

Importantly, in the tumor microenvironment the hypoxia response modulates the expression levels for important molecular targets in immunotherapy such as CD137, OX-40, FOXP3, and PD-L1. Modulation by hypoxia of tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and dendritic cells ought to play an important underexplored role in modulating tumor immunity. Overall, low O2 seems to invigorate some anti-tumor effector T-cell functions while conflictingly favoring T-regulatory cells (Tregs) in terms of their differentiation, suppressive functions, and recruitment.

The recent advances in the field of immune checkpoint modulation and the unprecedented clinical activity in advanced melanoma opens the door on novel combinations that may overcome tumor tolerogenic mechanisms that are known to suppress the potent anti-tumor impact of interferon (IFN)-\u03b1. Promising preliminary data suggest that such combinations may move the clinical management of advanced melanoma into the next level, beyond what is currently seen with immune checkpoint blockers alone.",

However, the majority of patients still do not experience clinical benefit upon these therapies. Moreover, immune-related side effects and the costs of these therapies prompt the search for their precise mode of action and for biomarker discovery. Here, we describe different classes of immunologic correlates such as pharmacodynamic changes observed in all treated patients, correlates with response during treatment (surrogate markers) or at the time-point of tumor assessment, as well as predictive markers for response and for immune-related adverse events. This review gives an overview of available data about correlates analyzed in the serum, all in immune cell subsets in the peripheral blood or in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. We will discuss how to prospectively validate and integrate these parameters for routine assessment of patients in daily clinical practice and give an outlook on promising future directions of biomarker research.",

The human herpes virus 8 (HHV8) and Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-related cancers of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) are most closely related to level of immune deficiency. Transplant recipients also have a greatly increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, related to direct carcinogenic effects of the pharmaceuticals used for immune suppression. For those three cancer types, the increased cancer risk is largely reversed when immune deficiency is decreased by treatment of HIV or by reduction of iatrogenic immune suppression. Other infection-related cancers also occur at increased rates, but it is not clear whether reduction of immune deficiency reduces cancer risk. Prostate and breast cancer do not occur at increased rates, providing strong evidence that these cancers are unlikely to be related to infection.

Quantitative knowledge of the HPV type-specific risks for these cancers, as well as for the different cervical cancer precursors (cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, CINs), is useful for estimating the effect of elimination of specific HPV types and clinical benefits of screening for specific HPV types. The present review summarizes both the worldwide presence of specific HPV types in cervical cancer precursors and in invasive cervical cancers, and also the long-term follow-up data from a large randomized clinical trial of HPV-based cervical cancer screening. All 12 HPV types classified as class I (established) carcinogens (HPV types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59) were more common in cervical cancers than among women without cervical lesions. A few rare HPV types also were more common in cervical cancers (eg, HPV26, 67, 68, 69, 73, 82). The follow-up studies found increased long-term risks particularly for HPV types 16, 18, 31, and 33, which had 14-year cumulative incidences for CIN3+above 28%, while HPV35, 45, 52, and 58 had 14-year risks between 14%\u201318% and HPV39, 51, 56, 59, 66, and 68 had risks<10%.

Advantage was taken of a large cohort of advanced, unresectable and untransplantable HCCs to compare the phenotypes resulting from HBV-based compared with HCV-based HCC. The main findings were that HBV-based HCC patients were statistically significantly younger, had a higher percent of males, had larger maximum tumor sizes, and had higher blood alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin levels and platelet counts than HCV-based HCC patients.

Universal hepatitis B vaccination has been shown to reduce the rates of HBV infection and HCC significantly. Once chronic HBV infection is established, antiviral treatment using interferon or nucleos(t)ide analogs is used to prevent disease progression to cirrhosis, HCC, or both. Studies have found viral replication indicated by HBV DNA level to be a strong risk factor for development of HCC. Additionally, periodic surveillance using ultrasonography and serum \u03b1-fetoprotein for earlier detection of HCC is also important so that curative treatments with survival benefit can be possible.

Carcinogenesis may result indirectly from longstanding hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. It also may arise directly from viral proteins and their interaction with the host intracellular machinery. Pegylated interferon plus ribavirin had been the standard antiviral regimen for a decade until recently when the paradigm shifted to the direct-acting antivirals. A large body of evidence has shown undisputedly that antiviral therapy can effectively reduce the occurrence of HCC in patients at any stage of liver fibrosis. Moreover, it is associated with an attenuated risk of recurrence following curative resection of the cancer. Sustained virological eradication is crucial for the effectiveness in clinical outcomes, whereas prolonged interferon maintenance without viral clearance should be regarded as obsolete. Surveillance remains essential after successful antiviral treatment because the risk of HCC is decreased but not eliminated, particularly in older patients or those with liver cirrhosis.

Application of the Network Phenotyping Strategy (NPS) provided quantitative descriptors of these patient coherences. Combination of these descriptors with Fisher information about the patient tumor mass and the histogram of the tumor masses in the whole cohort permitted estimation of the time from disease onset until clinical diagnosis (tbaseline). We found faster growth of smaller tumors having total masses<70 (80% of cohort) which involved about three times more interacting cellular processes than were observed for slower growing larger tumors (20% of cohort) with total masses>70. Combining the clinical survival and tbaseline normalized all HCC patients to a common 1,045 days of mean total disease duration (tbaseline plus post diagnosis survival). We also found a simple relationship between the baseline clinical status, tbaseline, and survival. Every difference between individual patient baseline clinical profiles and special coherent clinical status (HL1) reduced the above common overall survival (OVS) by 65 days. In summary, we showed that HCC patients with any given tumor can best have their tumor biology understood, when account is taken of the total clinical and liver contexts, and with knowing the point in the tumor history when an HCC diagnosis is made. This ability to compute the tbaseline from standard clinical data brings us closer to calculating survival from diagnosis of individual HCC patients.",

A causal link between MCPyV and MCC has been evidenced and this is the first polyomavirus to be clearly implicated as a causal agent underlying a human cancer, and MCPyV was recently classified as a 2A carcinogen. MCC is thus a rare tumor caused by a very common viral skin infection. The aim of this review is to provide a basic overview of the epidemiological, clinical, and pathological characteristics of MCC, to present the current knowledge on MCPyV polyomavirus and its causal association with MCC development, and to describe the therapeutic implications of this causal link.",

It has been discovered that immunotherapy often has delayed response kinetics, leading to the development of immune-related response criteria (irRC) in 2009. The irRC have distinguishing characteristics from traditional Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria that prevent physicians from prematurely discontinuing immunotherapy. In addition to these differences in response criteria, the safety profiles of immunotherapeutic agents are distinct from other NSCLC therapies.

Like normal stem cells (NSCs), CSCs can be identified by markers such as CD133, CD44, and ALDH.

The removal or ablation of known metastases, often present after systemic therapy regimens has the potential to be paradigm shifting rendering many patients without evidence of disease. However, the utility of these therapies has not been proven in phase III studies. Additionally, patient selection for metastasis-directed therapies is based on clinical criteria, with many patients not benefiting from these therapies. Refinements of radiation techniques are continuing, and discoveries are uncovering the biology of breast cancer in the oligometastatic state among patients. Integrated into ongoing studies, and those in development, they have the potential to alter standard management strategies in oligometastatic patients.",

     "abstract": "This review will discuss the evolution of the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer (HNC), over the last few decades. Studies were identified by searching PubMed electronic databases. Surgery followed by radiotherapy (RT) or definitive RT are potentially curative approaches for locally advanced HNC. While chemotherapy itself is not curative, it can improve cure rates when given as an adjunct to RT. The benefit of combining chemotherapy with RT is related to the timing of the chemotherapy. Several prospective randomized trials have demonstrated that concurrent delivery of chemotherapy and RT (CRT) is the most promising approach, given that locoregional recurrence is the leading pattern of failure for patients with locally advanced HNC. Induction chemotherapy before CRT has not been shown to be superior to CRT alone and the added toxicity may negatively impact the compliance with CRT. Sequential chemotherapy administration, in the form of induction chemotherapy followed by RT or CRT, has been successful as a strategy for organ preservation in patients with potentially resectable laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer. Systemic chemotherapy delivered concurrently with RT is used as a standard treatment for locally advanced HNC.",

     "abstract": "The dose distributions that can be achieved with protons are usually superior to those of conventional photon external-beam radiation. There are special cases where proton therapy may offer a substantial potential benefit compared to photon treatments where toxicity concerns dominate. Re-irradiation may theoretically be made safer with proton therapy due to lower cumulative lifetime doses to sensitive tissues, such as the spinal cord. Proton therapy has been used in a limited number of patients with rectal, pancreatic, esophageal, and lung cancers. Chordomas and soft tissue sarcomas require particularly high radiation doses, posing additional challenges for re-irradiation. Lymphoma is another special case where proton therapy may be advantageous. Late toxicities from even relatively low radiation doses, including cardiac complications and second cancers, are of concern in lymphoma patients with high cure rates and long life expectancies. Proton therapy has begun to be used for consolidation after chemotherapy in patients with Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Breast cancer is another emerging area of proton therapy development and use. Proton therapy may offer advantages compared to other techniques in the setting of breast boosts, accelerated partial breast irradiation, and post-mastectomy radiotherapy. In these settings, proton therapy may decrease toxicity associated with breast radiotherapy. As techniques are refined in proton therapy, we may be able to improve the therapeutic ratio by maintaining the benefits of radiotherapy while better minimizing the risks.",

     "abstract": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a form of non-ionizing radiation therapy that uses a drug, called a photosensitizer, combined with light to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) that can exert anti-cancer activity through apoptotic, necrotic, or autophagic tumor cell death. PDT is increasingly being used to treat thoracic malignancies. For early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), PDT is primarily employed as an endobronchial therapy to definitively treat endobronchial or roentgenographically occult tumors. Similarly, patients with multiple primary lung cancers may be definitively treated with PDT. For advanced or metastatic NSCLC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), PDT is primarily employed to palliate symptoms from obstructing endobronchial lesions causing airway compromise or hemoptysis. PDT can be used in advanced NSCLC to attempt to increase operability or to reduce the extent of operation intervention required, and selectively to treat pleural dissemination intraoperatively following macroscopically complete surgical resection. Intraoperative PDT can be safely combined with macroscopically complete surgical resection and other treatment modalities for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) to improve local control and prolong survival. This report reviews the mechanism of and rationale for using PDT to treat thoracic malignancies, details prospective and major retrospectives studies of PDT to treat NSCLC, SCLC, and MPM, and describes improvements in and future roles and directions of PDT.",

This has been driven primarily by advancements in imaging, which allow for precise placement of sources and applicators under image guidance, and volume-based optimization to ensure adequate tumor coverage while sparing adjacent normal tissue. There has been a shift towards high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy for many of the disease sites treated with brachytherapy. Simultaneously, with increasingly conformal treatment, there has been a shift towards utilization of higher doses per fraction, over fewer fractions, for specific disease sites where hypofractionation is believed to confer a radiobiological benefit. Here we review recent data and trends for those disease sites and conditions that are commonly treated with brachytherapy, including prostate, gynecologic, breast, head and neck, and skin cancers and salvage of recurrent disease.",

Lack of early diagnostic biomarkers and resistance to current therapies help explain these disappointing numbers. Thus, more effective and better-targeted therapies are needed quickly. Monoclonal antibodies offer an attractive alternative targeted therapy option for PDA because they are highly specific and potent. However, currently available monoclonal antibody therapies for PDA are still in their infancy with a low success rate and low likelihood of being approved. The challenges faced by these therapies include the following: lack of predictive and response biomarkers, unfavorable safety profiles, expression of targets not restricted to the cancer cells, flawed preclinical model systems, drug resistance, and PDA\u2019s complex nature. Additionally, discovery of novel PDA-specific antigen targets, present on the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix, is needed. Predictive and response markers also need to be determined for PDA patient subgroups so that the most appropriate effective therapy can be delivered. Serologic approaches, recombinant antibody-producing technologies, and advances in antibody engineering techniques will help to identify these predictive biomarkers and aid in the development of new therapeutic antibodies. A combinatorial approach simultaneously targeting antigens on the PDA cell, stroma, and immunosuppressive cells should be employed.",

This review focuses on the development of resistance to rituximab treatments and discusses possible underlying mechanisms of action, postulated mechanisms of resistance in model systems, and suggested means to overcome resistance.

Cancer patients commonly experience venous thromboembolism (VTE), a leading cause of mortality and a source of considerable morbidity and cost. The role of platelets in arterial thrombosis is well established, but emerging evidence supports the concept that platelets are also involved in initiation of VTE. This is particularly true in cancer-associated thrombosis as extensive new evidence shows that thrombocytosis and platelet activation are predictive biomarkers of VTE. The role of therapeutic anti-platelet agents has been proven effective at preventing VTE in non-cancer patients, and there are early data suggesting benefit in cancer patients as well.

     "abstract": "The main function of circulating platelets is to stop bleeding upon vascular injury by the formation of a hemostatic plug. The presence of cancer results in numerical and functional abnormalities of platelets. Thrombocytosis is commonly observed in cancer patients and is associated with decreased survival. Conversely, thrombocytopenia has been shown to have antimetastatic effects in experimental models. Tumor cells also can induce changes in the platelet activation status, both in direct and indirect manners. Direct tumor cell\u2013induced platelet aggregation enables the formation of a cloak of aggregated platelets around circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that shields them from attacks by the immune system and facilitates metastasis to distant sites. Cancer also can induce platelet activation in various indirect ways. Tumor cells shed small extracellular vesicles that expose the transmembrane protein tissue factor (TF)\u2014the initiator of the extrinsic coagulation cascade. The abundant presence of TF in the circulation of cancer patients can result in local generation of thrombin, the most potent platelet activator. Another pathway of indirect platelet activation is by increased formation of neutrophil extracellular traps in the presence of tumor-secreted granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Last, tumor cells may regulate the selective secretion of angiogenic proteins from platelet granules, which enables the tumor to stimulate and stabilize the immature neovasculature in the tumor environment. Since there is little doubt that the cancer-induced platelet alterations are beneficial to tumor growth and dissemination, it could be worthwhile to intervene in the underlying mechanisms for anticancer purposes. Antiplatelet and anticoagulant agents that inhibit platelet activation and thrombin generation can potentially slow cancer progression, although the clinical evidence thus far is not unequivocal.",

Over the past 20 years, VTE has become the second cause of death in cancer patients, where it accounts for increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Incidental VTE is increasingly diagnosed on systematic computed tomography in cancer patients, raising new questions in daily oncology practice. Risk factors for VTE in cancer include patient-, cancer-, and treatment-related parameters, which vary for a single patient throughout the course of cancer disease and necessitate repeated individual risk assessments. The use of biomarkers and risk assessment models allow identification of cancer patients at high risk for VTE. Anticoagulant therapy for the prophylaxis and the treatment of established VTE is efficient and relatively safe when contraindications are respected, but the variety of risk factors and the number of comorbidities remain major challenges for adequate VTE treatment in cancer patients. Several national guidelines for primary prevention and treatment of VTE in cancer patients were issued in the past 10 years. To homogeneize existing Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs), an international consensus working group released specific guidelines for the treatment and prophylaxis of VTE in cancer patients in 2013, so as to make each CPG easier to use at the national level. In cancer patients treated for VTE, the use of low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) is preferred over other anticoagulants in most cases, and LMWHs were shown to be superior to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). For the prophylaxis of VTE, LMWHs have been validated in surgical patients. For medical cancer patients, ongoing or recent clinical trials will inform our practice. However, several questions remain unanswered due to the number of comorbities in a single patient and expert opinion regarding special situations is required. Better adherence worldwide to CPGs necessitates adequate educational and active implementation strategies, which could substantially decrease the burden of VTE and increase survival in cancer patients.",

Treatment of cancer-associated VTE is far more challenging than treating VTE in the non-cancer population, as the clinical course of cancer patients is characterized by increased rates of both recurrent thromboembolic episodes and bleeding complications. This has led to the development of a distinct management approach towards VTE in patients with active cancer. Low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) currently represent the therapeutic agent of choice, as a result of a proven higher efficacy compared to vitamin K antagonists (VKAs). However, as LMWHs require daily subcutaneous injections, weight-adjusted doses, and still confers high risks of recurrent VTE and bleeding complications, management of cancer-associated VTE warrants further optimization. In recent years several novel, target-specific oral anticoagulants have been introduced and evaluated in clinical trials. These new anticoagulants display several advantages compared to conventional anticoagulants. This review will evaluate their trial results up-to-date with a particular focus on the cancer patients included in these trials.

On the other hand, platelets recruited to the tumor microenvironment interact, directly, with tumor cells, favoring their proliferation, and, indirectly, through the release of a wide palette of growth factors, including angiogenic and mitogenic proteins. In addition, the role of platelets is not solely confined to the primary tumor site. Indeed, they escort tumor cells, helping their intravasation, vascular migration, arrest, and extravasation to the tissues to form distant metastasis.

Activated platelets, in response to tissue damage, induce a proinflammatory program involving the aberrant expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, which leads to increased tissue concentrations of the proinflammatory and protumorigenic prostaglandin E2. The central role of platelet activation in cancer development is sustained by the analysis of clinical studies with aspirin showing an anti-cancer efficacy by the drug, even at the low doses used for the prevention of atherothrombosis. Low-dose aspirin acts as an antiplatelet agent by causing an irreversible inactivation of platelet COX-1 activity and the synthesis of thromboxane A2. Further experimental and clinical studies are ongoing to confirm the central role of platelets in the development of inflammation and cancer. The corroboration of this hypothesis will open new opportunities for the prevention and treatment of cancer.

     "abstract": "Previous work has shown that two general processes contribute to hepatocellular cancer (HCC) prognosis: liver damage, monitored by indices such as blood bilirubin, prothrombin time (PT), and aspartate aminostransferase (AST); and tumor biology, monitored by indices such as tumor size, tumor number, presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and blood alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels. These processes may affect one another, with prognostically significant interactions between multiple tumor and host parameters. These interactions form a context that provide personalization of the prognostic meaning of these factors for every patient. Thus, a given level of bilirubin or tumor diameter might have a different significance in different personal contexts. We previously applied network phenotyping strategy (NPS) to characterize interactions between liver function indices of Asian HCC patients and recognized two clinical phenotypes, S and L, differing in tumor size and tumor nodule numbers. Our aim was to validate the applicability of the NPS-based HCC S/L classification on an independent European HCC cohort, for which survival information was additionally available. Four sets of peripheral blood parameters, including AFP\u2013platelets, derived from routine blood parameter levels and tumor indices from the ITA.LI.CA database, were analyzed using NPS, a graph-theory\u2013based approach that compares personal patterns of complete relationships between clinical data values to reference patterns with significant association to disease outcomes. Without reference to the actual tumor sizes, patients were classified by NPS into two subgroups with S and L phenotypes. These two phenotypes were recognized using solely the HCC screening test results, consisting of eight common blood parameters, paired by their significant correlations, including an AFP\u2013platelets relationship. These trends were combined with patient age, gender, and self-reported alcoholism into NPS personal patient profiles. We subsequently validated (using actual scan data) that patients in L phenotype group had 1.5\u00d7 larger mean tumor masses relative to S, P = 6 \u00d7 10-16. Importantly, with the new data, liver test pattern-identified S-phenotype patients had typically 1.7\u00d7 longer survival compared to L-phenotype patients. NPS integrated the liver, tumor, and basic demographic factors. Cirrhosis-associated thrombocytopenia was typical for smaller S tumors. In L tumor phenotype, typical platelet levels increased with the tumor mass. Hepatic inflammation and tumor factors contributed to more aggressive L tumors, with parenchymal destruction and shorter survival. NPS provides integrative interpretation for HCC behavior, identifying two tumor and survival phenotypes by clinical parameter patterns. The NPS classifier is provided as an Excel tool. The NPS system shows the importance of considering each tumor marker and parameter in the total context of all the other parameters of an individual patient.",

Although in the oncologic context IFNs have been thought of more as exogenous pharmaceuticals, the autocrine and paracrine actions of endogenous IFNs probably have even more critical effects on neoplastic disease outcomes. Through high-affinity cell surface receptors, IFNs modulate transcriptional signaling, leading to regulation of more than 2,000 genes with varying patterns of temporal expression. Induction of the gene products by both unphosphorylated and phosphorylated STAT1 after ligand binding results in alterations in tumor cell survival, inhibition of angiogenesis, and augmentation of actions of T, natural killer (NK), and dendritic cells. The interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) signature can be a favorable biomarker of immune response but, in a seemingly paradoxical finding, a specific subset of the full ISG signature indicates an unfavorable response to DNA-damaging interventions such as radiation.

While there are multiple different mechanisms that cancer cells employ, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are one of the key drivers of tumor-mediated immune evasion. MDSCs begin as myeloid cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment, where they are transformed into potent immunosuppressive cells. However, our understanding of the clinical relevance of MDSCs in cancer patients has significantly lagged behind the preclinical literature in part due to the absence of a cognate molecule present in mice, as well as to the considerable heterogeneity of MDSCs. However, if one evaluates the clinical literature through the filter of clinically robust endpoints, such as overall survival, three important phenotypes emerge: promyelocytic, monocytic, and granulocytic. Based on these studies, MDSCs have clear prognostic importance in multiple solid tumors, and emerging data support the utility of circulating MDSCs as a predictive marker for cancer immunotherapy, and even as an early leading marker for predicting clinical response to systemic chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors. More recent preclinical data in immunosuppressed murine models suggest that MDSCs play an important role in tumor progression and the metastatic process that is independent of their immunosuppressive properties. Consequently, targeting MDSCs either in combination with cancer immunotherapy or independently as part of an approach to inhibit the metastatic process appears to be a very clinically promising strategy. We review different approaches to target MDSCs that could potentially be tested in future clinical trials in cancer patients.",

We identified the same HCC subgroups with mean tumor masses 9 cm x n (S) and 22 cm x n (L), P<10-14. The means of survival distribution (not available previously) for this new cohort were also significantly different (S was 12 months, L was 7 months, P<10-5). We characterized nine unique reference patterns of interactions between tumor and clinical environment factors, identifying four subtypes for S and five subtypes for L phenotypes, respectively. In L phenotype, all reference patterns were portal vein thrombosis (PVT)-positive, all platelet/alpha fetoprotein (AFP) levels were high, and all were chronic alcohol consumers. L had phenotype landmarks with worst survival. S phenotype interaction patterns were PVT-negative, with low platelet/AFP levels. We demonstrated that tumor\u2013clinical environment interaction patterns explained how a given parameter level can have a different significance within a different overall context. Thus, baseline bilirubin is low in S1 and S4, but high in S2 and S3, yet all are S subtype patterns, with better prognosis than in L.

     "abstract": "Metabolic synergy or metabolic coupling between glycolytic stromal cells (Warburg effect) and oxidative cancer cells occurs in human breast cancers and promotes tumor growth. The Warburg effect or aerobic glycolysis is the catabolism of glucose to lactate to obtain adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This review summarizes the main findings on this stromal metabolic phenotype, and the associated signaling pathways, as well as the critical role of oxidative stress and autophagy, all of which promote carcinoma cell mitochondrial metabolism and tumor growth. Loss of Caveolin 1 (Cav-1) and the upregulation of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4) in stromal cells are novel markers of the Warburg effect and metabolic synergy between stromal and carcinoma cells. MCT4 and Cav-1 are also breast cancer prognostic biomarkers. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are key mediators of the stromal Warburg effect. High ROS also favors cancer cell mitochondrial metabolism and tumorigenesis, and anti-oxidants can reverse this altered stromal and carcinoma metabolism. A pseudo-hypoxic state with glycolysis and low mitochondrial metabolism in the absence of hypoxia is a common feature in breast cancer. High ROS induces loss of Cav-1 in stromal cells and is sufficient to generate a pseudo-hypoxic state. Loss of Cav-1 in the stroma drives glycolysis and lactate extrusion via HIF-1\u03b1 stabilization and the upregulation of MCT4. Stromal cells with loss of Cav-1 and/or high expression of MCT4 also show a catabolic phenotype, with enhanced macroautophagy. This catabolic state in stromal cells is driven by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, nuclear factor \u03baB (NF\u03baB), and JNK activation and high ROS generation. A feed-forward loop in stromal cells regulates pseudo-hypoxia and metabolic synergy, with Cav-1, MCT4, HIF-1\u03b1, NF\u03baB, and ROS as its key elements. Metabolic synergy also may occur between cancer cells and cells in distant organs from the tumor. Cancer cachexia, which is due to severe organismal metabolic dysregulation in myocytes and adipocytes, shares similarities with stromal-carcinoma metabolic synergy, as well. In summary, metabolic synergy occurs when breast carcinoma cells induce a nutrient-rich microenvironment to promote tumor growth. The process of tumor metabolic synergy is a multistep process, due to the generation of ROS, and the induction of catabolism with autophagy, mitophagy and glycolysis. Studying epithelial\u2013stromal interactions and metabolic synergy is important to better understand the ecology of cancer and the metabolic role of different cell types in tumor progression.",

     "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is comprised of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), immune cells, and other supporting cells. Genetic changes in the carcinoma cells, such as alterations to TP53, NOTCH1, and specific gene expression profiles, contribute to derangements in cancer and microenvironment cells such as increased ROS, overproduction of cytokines, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). CAFs are among the most critical elements of the TME contributing to proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. The adaptive immune response is suppressed in HNSCC through overexpression of cytokines, triggered apoptosis of T cells, and alterations in antigen processing machinery. Overexpression of critical cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), contributes to EMT, immune suppression, and evolution of CAFs. Inflammation and hypoxia are driving forces in angiogenesis and altered metabolism. HNSCC utilizes glycolytic and oxidative metabolism to fuel tumorigenesis via coupled mechanisms between cancer cell regions and cells of the TME. Increased understanding of the TME in HNSCC illustrates that the long-held notion of \u201ccondemned mucosa\u201d reflects a process that extends beyond the epithelial cells to the entire tissue comprised of each of these elements.",

It features in several HCC classification systems and is an HCC prognostic factor. The aim of the present study was to examine the phenotypic tumor differences in HCC patients with normal or abnormal plasma bilirubin levels. A 2,416-patient HCC cohort was studied and dichotomized into normal and abnormal plasma bilirubin groups. Their HCC characteristics were compared for tumor aggressiveness features, namely, blood alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels, tumor size, presence of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) and tumor multifocality. In the total cohort, elevated bilirubin levels were associated with higher AFP levels, increased PVT and multifocality, and lower survival, despite similar tumor sizes. When different tumor size terciles were compared, similar results were found, even among patients with small tumors. A multiple logistic regression model for PVT or tumor multifocality showed increased odds ratios for elevated levels of gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP), bilirubin, and AFP and for larger tumor sizes. We conclude that HCC patients with abnormal bilirubin levels had worse prognosis than patients with normal bilirubin. They also had an increased incidence of PVT and tumor multifocality, and higher AFP levels, in patients with both small and larger tumors. The results show an association between bilirubin levels and indices of HCC aggressiveness.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer is no longer viewed mostly as a disease of abnormally proliferating epithelial cells, but rather as a disease affecting the complex interactions between the cells of the prostate epithelial compartment and the surrounding stromal compartment in which they live. Indeed, the microenvironment in which tumor cells evolve towards an aggressive phenotype is highly heterogeneous, as it is composed of different cell populations such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages, and lymphocytes, either resident or trans-differentiated by bone marrow\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cells recruited at the tumor site. Cancer-associated fibroblasts, the most abundant population within this microenvironment, exert a mandatory role in prostate cancer progression as they metabolically sustain cancer cell survival and growth, recruit inflammatory and immune cells, and promote cancer cells stemness and epithelial mesenchymal transition, thereby favoring metastatic dissemination of aggressive cancers. The interruption of this two-compartment crosstalk, together with the idea that stromal cells are mostly vulnerable, being drug-sensitive, could lead to the development of anticancer therapies that target tumor stromal elements.",

Tumor cells interact with the tumor microenvironment including immune cells. Blood and lymph vessels are the critical components that deliver nutrients to the tumor and also connect the tumor to the macroenvironment. Several factors are then released from the tumor itself but potentially also from the tumor microenvironment, influencing the metabolism of distant tissues and organs. Amino acids, and distinct lipid and lipoprotein species can be essential for further tumor growth. The role of glucose in tumor metabolism has been studied extensively. Cancer-associated cachexia is the most important tumor-associated systemic syndrome and not only affects the quality of life of patients with various malignancies but is estimated to be the cause of death in 15%\u201320% of all cancer patients. On the other hand, systemic metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes are known to influence tumor development. Furthermore, the clinical implications of the tumor macroenvironment are explored in the context of the patient\u2019s outcome with special consideration for pediatric tumors.

The estrogen receptor \u03b2 (ER\u03b2) is the major ER expressed in lung tissues, while inflammatory cells capable of infiltrating the lung are reported to express both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2. Although there is evidence in animals of preferential effects of ER\u03b2 in the lungs of females, human lung tumors from males also contain ER\u03b2-positive cells and express aromatase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to estrogens.

The advent of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has changed how we treat those patients who cannot undergo surgery secondary to comorbidities or patient preference. SABR allows for precise radiation delivery in a short course and at high doses. Adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the standard of care for completely resected high-risk stage IB and stage II NSCLC based on a ~5% improvement in 5-year overall survival.

In this setting the goal of treatment is to prolong survival and to control disease- and treatment-related symptoms. Currently systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the first-line treatment for most patients with stage IV NSCLC, but preferred treatments are now defined by histology and based on the presence of specific molecular abnormalities. In first-line the combination of platinum plus pemetrexed with or without bevacizumab is a reasonable choice in patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as first-line therapy are the recommended for patients with EGFR-sensitizing mutations. A small-molecule TKI of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), crizotinib, showed pronounced clinical activity in the treatment of patients with NSCLC positive for EML4-ALK and it has rapidly entered into daily clinical practice. Currently no agents are specifically approved for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. Second-line treatments include docetaxel, pemetrexed, or erlotinib as single agents. There is a growing evidence that cytotoxics are better than EGFR-TKIs in EGFR wild-type patients. In the setting of the third line, the only approved agent is erlotinib. In elderly patients with good performance status (PS), doublet chemotherapy including platinum should not be excluded, especially for those patients 70\u201375 years of age without comorbidities.

The substitution of irinotecan for etoposide in the frontline treatment of SCLC achieved significant efficacy benefit in Japanese patients, but similar benefit could not be reproduced in other patient populations. Salvage treatment for recurrent or progressive SCLC is particularly challenging, where topotecan remains the only agent with regulatory approval to date.

The NovoTTF-100A\u2122 System is a novel antimitotic cancer therapy recently approved for the treatment of recurrent GBM, based on phase III (EF-11) trial results. The Patient Registry Dataset (PRiDe) is a post-marketing registry of all recurrent GBM patients who received NovoTTF Therapy in a real-world, clinical practice setting in the United States between 2011 and 2013. Data were collected from all adult patients with recurrent GBM who began commercial NovoTTF Therapy in the United States between October 2011 and November 2013. All patients provided written consent before treatment was started. Overall survival (OS) curves were constructed for PRiDe using the Kaplan-Meier method. Median OS in PRiDe was compared for patients stratified by average daily compliance (\u226575% v<75% per day) and other prognostic variables. Adverse events were also evaluated. Data from 457 recurrent GBM patients who received NovoTTF Therapy in 91 US cancer centers were analyzed. More patients in PRiDe than the EF-11 trial received NovoTTF Therapy for first recurrence (33% v 9%) and had received prior bevacizumab therapy (55.1% v 19%). Median OS was significantly longer with NovoTTF Therapy in clinical practice (PRiDe data set) than in the EF-11 trial (9.6 v 6.6 months; HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.86, P = .0003).

First and second versus third and subsequent recurrences, high Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and no prior bevacizumab use were favorable prognostic factors. No unexpected adverse events were detected in PRiDe.

GBM tumors invariably recur, and there is no widely recognized and effective standard treatment for recurrent GBM. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM with potential benefits compared with other options. Recurrent GBM patients from two prior trials with demonstrated radiologic tumor response to single-agent NovoTTF Therapy were analyzed to better characterize tumor response patterns and evaluate the associations between response, compliance, and OS. In addition, a compartmental tumor growth model was developed and evaluated for its ability to predict GBM response to tumor-treating fields (TTFields). The overall response rate across both trials was 15% (4% complete responses): 14% in the phase III trial (14/120) and 20% (2/10) in a pilot study. Tumor responses to NovoTTF Therapy developed slowly (median time to response, 5.2 months) but were durable (median duration, 12.9 months). Response duration was highly correlated with OS (r2 = .92, P<.0001), and median OS for responders was 24.8 months. Seven of 16 responders exhibited initial tumor growth on magnetic resonance imaging. Compliance appeared to be linked with both improved response and survival. The tumor growth model predicted tumor arrest and shrinkage only after several weeks of continuous NovoTTF Therapy, consistent with the observed clinical findings of initial transient tumor growth in some patients. NovoTTF Therapy is a novel antimitotic treatment for recurrent GBM associated with slowly developing but durable tumor responses in approximately 15% of patients. Some responders exhibit initial tumor growth before shrinkage, indicating treatment should not be terminated prior to allowing for the full effect of NovoTTF Therapy to be realized. OS is longer in responders than in nonresponders. High daily compliance rates may be associated with increased likelihood of an objective response and are predictive of improved survival.",

Median overall survival (OS) was compared for recurrent GBM patients receiving at least one full cycle of treatment with NovoTTF-100A System or BPC chemotherapy (modified intention-to-treat [mITT] population) in the recently reported phase III trial. The relationship between NovoTTF-100A System compliance and OS was evaluated in the ITT population. Kaplan-Meier analyses examined treatment-related differences in OS for various patient subgroups.

When used as intended in mITT patients with recurrent GBM, NovoTTF Therapy provides an OS benefit compared with chemotherapy in patients with recurrent GBM. This contrasts with the equivalent efficacy reported previously based on analysis of all randomized ITT subjects, including many who did not receive a full cycle of treatment.

Common treatment modalities for NSCLC include surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and, in recent years, the clinical management paradigm has evolved with the advent of targeted therapies. Despite such advances, the impact of systemic therapies for advanced disease remains modest, and as such, the prognosis for patients with NSCLC remains poor. Standard modalities are not without their respective toxicities and there is a clear need to improve both efficacy and safety for current management approaches. Tumor-treating fields (TTFields) are low-intensity, intermediate-frequency alternating electric fields that disrupt proper spindle microtubule arrangement, thereby leading to mitotic arrest and ultimately to cell death. We evaluated the effects of combining TTFields with standard chemotherapeutic agents on several NSCLC cell lines, both in vitro and in vivo. Frequency titration curves demonstrated that the inhibitory effects of TTFields were maximal at 150 kHz for all NSCLC cell lines tested, and that the addition of TTFields to chemotherapy resulted in enhanced treatment efficacy across all cell lines. We investigated the response of Lewis lung carcinoma and KLN205 squamous cell carcinoma in mice treated with TTFields in combination with pemetrexed, cisplatin, or paclitaxel and compared these to the efficacy observed in mice exposed only to the single agents. Combining TTFields with these therapeutic agents enhanced treatment efficacy in comparison with the respective single agents and control groups in all animal models. Together, these findings suggest that combining TTFields therapy with chemotherapy may provide an additive efficacy benefit in the management of NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "The immune system plays a vital role in regulating the growth of tumors. Some types of inflammatory responses can promote tumor growth, while a tumor-specific adaptive immune response can potentially control tumor growth. Malignancies have the ability to evade the immune system, and proliferate and metastasize. The goal of immunotherapy is to marshal the specificity and long-term memory of the adaptive immune response to achieve durable tumor regression and possible cure, although, to date, this has been achieved in only a small subset of patients. A variety of approaches to immunotherapy have been investigated. These include administration of exogenous cytokines or therapeutic vaccines to increase the frequency of tumor-specific T cells, adoptive transfer of tumor-specific immune effector cells, and, more recently, the application of a variety of immune checkpoint inhibitors and agonists of co-stimulatory receptors to overcome tumor-induced immune-suppressive mechanisms. Some approaches have been more successful than others for reasons that are now becoming apparent, and these observations have led to an exciting resurgence in clinical research to develop more effective immunotherapeutic strategies.",

It is approved for use as monotherapy for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma (rGB). TTFields are delivered through insulated transducer arrays applied onto the shaved scalp and connected to a battery-operated field generator. The occurrence of dermatologic adverse events (dAEs) is primarily due to the continuous contact between the array-related components and the scalp for periods of 3\u20134 days (together with other risk factors). These dAEs may include allergic and irritant dermatitis, mechanical lesions, ulcers, and skin infection. The incidence of dAEs in the phase III trial (n = 116) was 16% (2% grade 2, 0% grade 3/4); the post-marketing surveillance program (n = 570) revealed 156 (21.8%) dAEs with some patients reporting more than one event. Prophylactic strategies for dAEs include proper shaving and cleansing of the scalp and array relocation. Treatment-based strategies are AE-specific and include topical or oral antibiotics, topical corticosteroids, and isolation of affected skin areas from adhesives and pressure. The addition of skin care strategies to the NovoTTF-100A System use will maximize adherence to therapy while maintaining quality of life, all of which contribute to the therapeutic benefit of NovoTTF Therapy in rGB.",

Biologics are more complex to manufacture and take longer to bring to market. Because biologics are considerably more costly than small-molecule drugs, their use has placed an increasing economic demand on healthcare systems worldwide. Biosimilars are designed to be highly similar to existing branded biologics, but because biologics cannot be exactly copied, biosimilars should not be referred to as generic, exact versions of the innovator biologic. Biosimilars have the potential to increase access and provide lower cost options for cancer care as patent protection for some of the most widely used biologics begins to expire. Regulatory requirements for biosimilars are evolving, as are global harmonization and/or standardization strategies that can facilitate their robust clinical development. This review highlights critical factors involved with the integration of biosimilars into oncology treatment paradigms and practices. Clinicians will likely seek out practice guidelines and position statements from established scientific societies to help evaluate key information regarding biosimilars, such as efficacy, safety, comparability, and interchangeability with the reference biologic. Automatic substitution, nomenclature, extrapolation of clinical data from one indication to another, as well as parameters for ongoing pharmacovigilance are evolving considerations.

The median time to development of t-MDS/AML is 3\u20135 years, with the risk decreasing markedly after the first decade. t-MDS/AML is the major cause of non-relapse mortality after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for HL or NHL.

Two types of t-MDS/AML are recognized depending on the causative therapeutic exposure: an alkylating agent/radiation-related type and a topoisomerase II inhibitor\u2013related type. Inter-individual variability in the risk for development of t-MDS/AML suggests a role for genetic variation in susceptibility to genotoxic exposures.

While few of these studies have included subjects aged 65 years and older, it is logical to expect that older patients are at risk of cognitive decline.\u00a0Here, we use breast cancer as an exemplar disease for inquiry into the intersection of aging and cognitive effects of cancer and its therapies. There are a striking number of common underlying potential biological risks and pathways for the development of cancer, cancer-related cognitive declines, and aging processes, including the development of a frail phenotype. Candidate shared pathways include changes in hormonal milieu, inflammation, oxidative stress, DNA damage and compromised DNA repair, genetic susceptibility, decreased brain blood flow or disruption of the blood-brain barrier, direct neurotoxicity, decreased telomere length, and cell senescence. There also are similar structure and functional changes seen in brain imaging studies of cancer patients and those seen with \u201cnormal\u201d aging and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Disentangling the role of these overlapping processes is difficult since they require aged animal models and large samples of older human subjects. From what we do know, frailty and its low cognitive reserve seem to be a clinically useful marker of risk for cognitive decline after cancer and its treatments. This and other results from this review suggest the value of geriatric assessments to identify older patients at the highest risk of cognitive decline. Further research is needed to understand the interactions between aging, genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and frailty phenotypes to best identify the subgroups of older patients at greatest risk for decline and to develop behavioral and pharmacological interventions targeting this group. We recommend that basic science and population trials be developed specifically for older hosts with intermediate endpoints of relevance to this group, including cognitive function and trajectories of frailty. Clinicians and their older patients can advance the field by active encouragement of and participation in research designed to improve the care and outcomes of the growing population of older cancer patients.",

Furthermore, the discussion of outcomes with patients should include risk stratification, as the prospects for survival are quite different depending on whether the patient has high-risk MM or not. The tools for measuring risk subcategory are widely available and now routinely employed in the clinic. The continued search for genetic abnormalities that underlie the biology of MM may allow for even better precision therapy in the future.",

     "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM), a heterogeneous plasma cell dyscrasia with a variety of clinical presentations and outcomes, is undergoing a treatment renaissance. While new drug classes have been discovered, a subset of high-risk MM remains relatively refractory to treatment. Current risk stratifications models, such as Durie-Salmon and the International Staging System, estimate disease burden and prognosis. Cytogenetics and gene expression profiles can help further identify more aggressive disease. Additionally, molecular and immunophenotypic assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) and different imaging studies can identify patients at higher risk for relapse. It is now an opportune time to develop algorithms to combine all of the currently available clinical and genomic information to begin to inform specific therapeutic intervention in individual patients or at least smaller subgroups with similarly behaving disease.",

     "abstract": "Until the advents of novel agents, partial response (PR) or better was the established gold standard to initial therapy of multiple myeloma (MM), and treatment goals were focused on relieving symptoms, prevention of organ damage, and modest improvements in survival. With the introduction of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT), deeper responses, including complete responses (CRs) were more frequent, and contributed to longer survival. In the era of novel therapies, ASCT remains commonly used and its impact on outcome appears superior, albeit less so than when compared with conventional therapy, and its survival benefit is yet to be established in either setting. In addition, in non-transplant candidates, novel therapies have now significantly improved the overall response rates, depth of response, and clinical benefit, to the levels previously only observed with ASCT, which now increasingly challenges the role and timing of ASCT in eligible patients. Nevertheless, the two approaches of treatment, transplant or no transplant, remain commonly accepted. With an improvement in the tolerability of newer regimens and the deferral of ASCT in transplant candidates, the debate has emerged whether the two-pathway approach to the treatment of newly diagnosed myeloma should be re-evaluated. At the same time, treatment goals are also shifting. Many believe that MM can be converted into a chronic disease and that a functional cure maybe a realistic goal, for at least a proportion of patients.

We reviewed the evolution of maintenance therapy from traditional chemotherapy, interferon (IFN), and prednisone to the current use of thalidomide, lenalidomide, and bortezomib in the post-transplant maintenance setting. Based on existing literature, either thalidomide or lenalidomide can be recommended for maintenance therapy post-transplant resulting in improved progression- free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Thalidomide is less tolerated than lenalidomide and does not improve survival in patient subgroups who had achieved at least a very good partial response (VGPR) or who had chromosome 13 deletion. Thalidomide maintenance may be even detrimental in patients with high-risk cytogenetics. Alternatively, lenalidomide maintenance improves PFS in all subgroups of patients including those achieving at least a VGPR and those with high-risk cytogenetics, and improves OS in one other study. Bortezomib maintenance improves PFS and OS as part of induction and maintenance when compared to thalidomide maintenance and it is uncertain as to whether this improvement was due to bortezomib used during induction.

The prevailing literature has focused on the most common type, the clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) subgroup, in which familial and sporadic disease demonstrate similar molecular profiles. ccRCC is dominated by inactivating mutations in VHL, leading to constitutive activation of the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and resultant hypoxia response transcription signature, including changes that markedly affect cellular metabolic programs. Recent studies in ccRCC also have implicated mutations in regulators of chromatin remodeling and histone methylation. Although papillary and chromophobe histologies of RCC are highly distinct genetically, both have disruptions in metabolic signaling, suggesting that modulations of basic bioenergetics pathways may regulate kidney cell fates and phenotypes. Finally, emerging evidence of tumor heterogeneity and convergent evolution is reshaping our understanding of how these tumors evolve, underscoring which genetic events are driver mutations, and prompting further consideration of how to interpret molecular analyses of primary tumors in making assessments related to metastatic disease.

Primary treatment with radiation or surgery is largely successful at controlling localized disease. However, a significant number (up to one third of men) may develop biochemical recurrence (BR), defined as a rise in serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. A general presumption is that BR will lead to overt progression in patients over subsequent years. There are a number of factors that a physician must consider when counseling and recommending treatment to a patient with a rising PSA. These include the following (1) various PSA-based definitions of BR; (2) source of PSA (ie, local or distant disease, residual benign prostate); (3) available modalities to treat the disease with the least morbidity; and (4) timing of therapy.

For metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), response biomarkers have historically been poorly reproducible, inaccurate, inconsistently applied, or only loosely associated with tangible clinical benefits such as survival. However, the field of response assessments for prostate cancer is maturing, in compliance with a rigorous process defined by analytic validation, clinical validation, and clinical qualification. For example, bone imaging with technetium-99m scintigraphy has historically been poorly used in prostate cancer clinical trials and routine patient care, and frequently has led to poor decision-making. However, contemporary clinical trial consensus criteria (Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 [PCWG2]) have standardized the definition of progression on bone scintigraphy and the clinical trials endpoint of radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS). A validated bone scan interpretation form captures the relevant data elements. rPFS and the forms have been undergoing prospective testing in multiple phase III studies. The first of these trials demonstrated a high degree of reproducibility and correlation with overall survival, and rPFS was used by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for approval of abiraterone in chemotherapy-na\u00efve mCRPC. Circulating tumor cells (CTC) are another class of assays with significant promise as response-indicator biomarkers.

The field has recently witnessed several important developments stemming from improvements in histopathological classification schemes, advanced imaging techniques, and a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor progression (in both sporadic and hereditary cancers). Platinum-based chemotherapy remains the mainstay of therapy for high grade carcinomas. In contrast, the treatment of advanced well-differentiated NET depends on site of origin, underlying tumor biology, and whether or not the patient is symptomatic. Somatostatin analogs continue to play a key role in controlling hormone-mediated symptoms. In addition, octreotide has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in midgut carcinoids. Novel somatostatin analogs (for use alone or in the context of peptide receptor radiotherapy or imaging) are on the horizon. Agents targeting VEGF- and mTOR-pathway signaling have been approved for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. In addition, two RET inhibitors have been approved for medullary thyroid cancer, evidence for a fundamentally new treatment paradigm (based on the use of targeted agents). Despite the advances, there remains a serious unmet need for additional treatment options for refractory high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas, paragangliomas/pheochromocytomas, adrenocortical carcinomas, and progressive carcinoid tumors.

The same study reported that ATRX/DAXX genes are mutated in a significant number of tumors, as are genes encoding components of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signal transduction pathway. These findings have implications for the new therapies that have been approved for the treatment of PNETs, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib, as well the mTOR inhibitor everolimus. Small intestinal NETs show a less varied mutational pattern in that the majority of genetic alterations are found on chromosome 18. There seem to be no differences between the sporadic and the familiar type of small intestinal NETs (carcinoids). A wide range of genetic alterations have been described for the different subtypes of NETs, but the mechanisms underlying tumor development are essentially unknown except for MEN-2, in which an activating mutation of the RET proto-oncogene drives tumor progression and affords a direct genotype/phenotype correlation.

The results of a recent randomized phase III trial (PROMID) demonstrated that the median time to progression in patients with midgut carcinoid tumors treated with octreotide LAR (Long-Acting-Repeatable, Novartis, Basel, Switzerland) was more than twice as long compared to that of patients treated with placebo.

T lymphocytes play a critical role in allograft rejection, graft failure, and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). T-cell tolerance occurs by two different mechanisms: (1) depletion of self-reactive T cells during their maturation in the thymus (central tolerance), and (2) suppression/elimination of self-reactive mature T cells in the periphery (peripheral tolerance). Induction of transplant tolerance improves transplantation outcomes. Adoptive immunotherapy with immune suppressor cells including regulatory T cells, natural killer (NK)-T cells, veto cells, and facilitating cells are promising therapies for modulation of immune tolerance. Achieving mixed chimerism with the combination of thymic irradiation and T-cell\u2013depleting antibodies, costimulatory molecule blockade with/without inhibitory signal activation, and elimination of alloreactive T cells with varying methods including pre- or post-transplant cyclophosphamide administration appear to be effective in inducing transplant tolerance.",

Indeed, related haplo-donors are usually extremely motivated, immediately available, and can provide additional stem or immune cells when required, a most important feature in the context of high-risk malignancies. Immunomagneticallly selected CD34+ stem cell grafts enable rapid and sustained trilineage engraftment. However, the associated delay in immune reconstitution results in significant risk for severe infectious complications and malignant relapse. The infusion of T lymphocytes selectively depleted of their anti-host reactive components represents a most interesting approach to accelerate post-transplant T-cell recovery. Such a strategy relies on ex vivo donor cell activation against host antigens and their selective elimination. Immunotoxins and magnetic beads could target antigens such as CD25 with impressive results. Photodepletion of alloreactive T cells represents an appealing alternative to both eliminate anti-host immune T cells and spare resting T cells to fight infections. Interestingly, regulatory T cells can be retained after such treatment, and have been found to transform non-regulatory into regulatory T cells, a finding that may be of utmost importance in both prevention and control of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Efforts to promote efficient antigen presentation and selective allodepletion promise to accelerate immune reconstitution without GVHD and to address the most crucial issues in haplo-mismatched and other types of transplants.",

Further, partial or full donor hematopoietic chimerism following alloSCT may be sufficient to guarantee immunologic tolerance to solid organs from the same donor, obviating any requirement for prolonged pharmacologic immunosuppression. Despite alloSCT's potential, the procedure is beset by two major limitations. The first relates to the procedure's toxicity, including conditioning regimen toxicity, graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infection. The second limitation is the lack of histocompatible donors. A human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling or unrelated donor cannot be identified expeditiously for up to 40% of patients. Historically, alloSCT from partially HLA-mismatched, or HLA-haploidentical, relatives has been complicated by unacceptably high incidences of graft rejection, severe GVHD, and non-relapse mortality. Recently, our groups have developed a method to selectively deplete alloreactive cells in vivo by administering high doses of cyclophosphamide in a narrow window after transplantation. Using high-dose, post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT/Cy), crossing the HLA barrier in alloSCT is now feasible and donors can be found for nearly all patients.

We developed a two-step approach to haploidentical HSCT in which the lymphoid and myeloid portions of the graft are given in two separate steps in order to control and optimize T-cell dosing. The initial results from these trials have included robust immune reconstitution, low rates of toxicity and significant GVHD, and durable disease control in good-risk patients, as well as insights regarding a threshold for T-cell dosing above which graft-versus-tumor (GVT) effects might be expected. Patients who were not in remission at the time of HSCT had higher rates of relapse requiring efforts to further strengthen GVT effects.

Individual alterations of these markers have been associated with disease outcome, with several observations suggesting that their prognostic potential is independent of pathological stage. While many individual molecules in the cell growth receptor signaling, p53, and retinoblastoma (Rb) pathways have been identified, there is a general lack of consensus on which markers can be adopted in the clinical setting.

Non\u2013muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma can be removed by transurethral resection but these cancers tend to recur in most patients. Conventional treatments decrease the recurrence rate but are associated with side effects and frequent failures. Thus, there is an obvious need for the development of highly effective targeted therapies with limited side effects. Accordingly, a double-promoter vector was developed, expressing diphtheria toxin A (DTA) under control of two different regulatory promoter sequences, H19 and IGF2. This vector was then used to transfect and to eradicate tumor cells in bladder cancer models, effectively destroying tumor cells without affecting normal cells. Our studies demonstrate the potential efficacy of the therapeutic vector and should be a solid base for future clinical studies.

For patients with surgically resectable tumors, a partial cystectomy with en-bloc resection of the urachal ligament with the bladder dome and umbilicus is required to appropriately control the tumor. Leaving the umbilicus in place provides inadequate control and has been associated with a higher risk of relapse. A lymph node dissection also may help in the control of this cancer.

     "abstract": "The only hope for a cure from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rests on early diagnosis as it can be attained through semiannual surveillance with abdominal ultrasound (US) of patients at risk. While the strategy of semiannual screening rests on the growth rate of the tumor that in cirrhotic patients takes 6 months to double its volume, on average, the noninvasive radiological diagnosis of HCC is possible in cirrhotic patients with a de novo HCC and patients with chronic hepatitis B. More recently, metabolic diseases related to insulin resistance, including diabetes and obesity, have been recognized to be causally related to HCC as well, in most patients bridging HCC to the histopathological diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). While the endpoint of an early diagnosis is achieved quite easily in most patients with >1 cm HCC by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrating the specific pattern of an intense contrast uptake during the arterial phase (wash-in) and contrast wash-out during the venous/delayed phase, nodules <1 cm in size are more difficult to diagnose, almost invariably requiring an enhanced follow up with three monthly examinations with US until they grow in size or change their echo pattern. Owing to the lack of robust controlled evidence demonstrating a clinical benefit of surveillance, the real support for screening for liver cancer comes from the striking differences in response to therapy between screened populations in whom HCC is diagnosed and treated at early stages and patients with more advanced, incidentally detected tumors. This notwithstanding, numerous barriers work against screening effectiveness, including limited or outdated knowledge, lack of financial incentives, and limited access to appropriate testing and treatment. Though strengthening prediction in individual patients is expected to improve the cost-effectiveness ratio of screening, the benefits of approaches like pretreatment patient stratification by clinical, histologic, and genetic scores remain uncertain, while the worthiness of excluding patients with severe comorbidities and aged individuals is still debated.",

     "abstract": "With the recent dramatic advances in diagnostic modalities, the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is primarily based on imaging. Ultrasound (US) plays a crucial role in HCC surveillance. Dynamic multiphasic multidetector-row CT (MDCT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the standard diagnostic methods for the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC, which can be made based on hemodynamic features (arterial enhancement and delayed washout). The technical development of MDCT and MRI has made possible the fast scanning with better image quality and resolution, which enables an accurate CT hemodynamic evaluation of hepatocellular tumor, as well as the application of perfusion CT and MRI in clinical practice. Perfusion CT and MRI can measure perfusion parameters of tumor quantitatively and can be used for treatment response assessment to anti-vascular agents. Besides assessing the hemodynamic or perfusion features of HCC, new advances in MRI can provide a cellular information of HCC. Liver-specific hepatobiliary contrast agents, such as gadoxetic acid, give information regarding hepatocellular function or defect of the lesion, which improves lesion detection and characterization. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of the liver provides cellular information of HCC and also has broadened its role in lesion detection, lesion characterization, and treatment response assessment to chemotherapeutic agents. In this article, we provide an overview of the state-of-the art imaging techniques of the liver and their clinical role in management of HCC.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in some areas of the world. In most cases, HCC is diagnosed at a late stage. Therefore, the prognosis of patients with HCC is generally poor. The recommended screening strategy for patients with cirrhosis includes the determination of serum \u03b1-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and an abdominal ultrasound every 6 months to detect HCC at an earlier stage. AFP, however, is a marker characterized by poor sensitivity and specificity, and abdominal ultrasound is highly dependent on the operator's experience. In addition to AFP, Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP (AFP-L3), des-\u03b3-carboxy prothrombin (DCP), glypican-3 (GPC-3), osteopontin (OPN), and several other biomarkers (such as squamous cell carcinoma antigen\u2013immunoglobulin M complexes [SCCA-IgM], alpha-1-fucosidase [AFU], chromogranin A [CgA], human hepatocyte growth factor, insulin-like growth factor) have been proposed as markers for the early detection of HCC. For these markers, we describe the mechanisms of production, and their diagnostic and prognosis roles. None of them is optimal; however, when used together, their sensitivity in detecting HCC is increased. Recent research has shown that some biomarkers have mitogenic and migratory activities in the angiogenesis of HCC and are a factor of tumor growth.",

There has been marked progress in the treatment of HCC. However, effective treatments are limited to patients with less advanced HCC. The detection of HCC at an early stage is still a prerequisite for improved prognosis. To address this problem, a variety of screening modalities are used, including measurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasonography (US) at regular intervals in high-risk populations. Unfortunately, poor sensitivity and specificity of AFP and the operator-dependency of US limit the value of either test to diagnose early-stage lesions. Other tests, including Lens culinaris agglutinin-reactive AFP and des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP), are currently being evaluated and may be superior to current tests. Recent developments in gene-expressing microarrays and proteomics promise even more potential diagnostic options.

CSCs have been identified in many tumor types, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the fifth most common and third most deadly malignancy with observable heterogeneity. Numerous studies have shown that hepatic CSCs could be enriched via different cell surface markers, eg, CD13, CD24, CD44, CD90, CD133, EpCAM (CD326), and OV6. They also could be identified through functional assays such as isolating the side population cells by Hoechst dye staining or screening cells with a high activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase. Functional characterization of hepatic CSCs has revealed several deregulated signaling pathways, such as Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, AKT, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2), interleukin (IL)-6/STAT3 pathways to be critical in inducing \u201cstemness\u201d of HCC and in promoting self-renewal, tumorigenicity, and chemoresistance.

Recent development of genomic technologies has enabled survey of molecular aberrations and deregulations directly from patient specimens in a comprehensive manner. This also has provided clues to therapeutic/preventive targets that could also serve as prognostic/predictive biomarkers. Structural alterations and chemical modifications of genomic DNA have been shown to be useful to guide molecular targeted therapies in some cancers.

Various strategies to improve outcomes for this patient group have become the subject of much ongoing clinical research. The introduction of embolic, drug-eluting beads (DEB) for transarterial administration has been shown to significantly reduce liver toxicity and systemic drug exposure compared to conventional regimens. The addition of molecular targeted drugs to the therapeutic armamentarium for HCC has prompted the design of clinical trials aimed at investigating the synergies between TACE and systemic treatments. Combining TACE with agents with anti-angiogenic properties represents a promising strategy, because TACE is thought to cause local hypoxia, resulting in a temporary increase in levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Recently, a large phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (the SPACE study) has shown that the concurrent administration of DEB-TACE and sorafenib has a manageable safety profile and has suggested that time to progression and time to vascular invasion or extrahepatic spread may be improved with respect to DEB-TACE alone.

Our laboratory has focused on a multistep \u201cpush-pull\u201d approach in which we combine strategies to overcome each of the mechanisms of escape. If tumor epitopes are insufficiently immunogenic, we increase their immunogenicity by epitope enhancement, improving their binding affinity to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. If the anti-tumor response is too weak or of the wrong phenotype, we use cytokines, costimulatory molecules, Toll-like receptor ligands, and other molecular adjuvants to increase not only the quantity of the response but also its quality, to push the response in the right direction. Finally, the tumor invokes multiple immunosuppressive mechanisms to defend itself, so we need to overcome those as well, including blocking or depleting regulatory cells or inhibiting regulatory molecules, to pull the response by removing the brakes. Some of these strategies individually have now been translated into human clinical trials in cancer patients. Combinations of these in a push-pull approach are promising for the successful immunotherapy of cancer.",

In addition to gaining motility and invasiveness, tumor cells that undergo EMT also acquire increased resistance to many traditional cancer treatment modalities, including chemotherapy and radiation.

The process of EMT is driven by a group of transcription factors designated as EMT transcription factors, such as Snail, Slug, Twist, and the recently identified T-box family member, Brachyury. In an attempt to determine which of these drivers of EMT is more amenable to targeted therapies and, in particular, T-cell\u2013mediated immunotherapeutic approaches, we have examined their relative expression levels in a range of human and murine normal tissues, cancer cell lines, and human tumor biopsies.

We also demonstrated that Brachyury is immunogenic and that Brachyury-specific CD8+ T cells expanded in vitro are able to lyse Brachyury-positive tumor cells. We thus propose Brachyury as an attractive target for vaccination strategies designed to specifically target tumor cells undergoing EMT.",

One of these antibodies, ipilimumab, also prolonged overall survival in two randomized phase III studies, leading to regulatory approval for marketing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Paradigms for the administration of anti\u2013CTLA-4 and newer immunomodulatory agents have evolved to effectively manage the adverse events and also to consider unique patterns and kinetics of tumor response. Early clinical studies of another antagonist antibody, which blocks the co-inhibitory receptor PD-1 on activated T cells, also are showing promising activity in metastatic melanoma. The clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines, which in broad terms also includes intratumorally administered agents designed to increase tumor immunogenicity, is being investigated in ongoing phase III trials, and various new agents are in earlier development, including newer cytokines and T-cell or DC co-stimulatory antibodies, some of which have already demonstrated clinical activity in advanced disease.

However, a minority of CML patients in chronic phase (CP) and a substantial proportion of patients in advanced phase are either initially refractory to TKIs or eventually develop resistance. Rates of resistance and relapse directly correlate with disease progression. The most frequently identified mechanism of acquired TKI resistance is BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) mutations that impair TKI binding by disrupting the drug contact sites or causing conformational changes that make the contact sites inaccessible. The underlying mechanisms of disease progression are heterogeneous and only poorly understood. So far the most frequent and best characterized include genomic instability, loss of tumor-suppressor functions, and differentiation arrest. Clinical data indicate that both development of a BCR-ABL1 KD mutation during TKI treatment and/or disease progression are associated with a poorer outcome. Thus, therapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment or prevention of resistance and disease progression. They include, for example, TKI dose escalation, treatment interruption to stop selection of resistant cells, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation in eligible patients, as well as the use of novel TKIs with activity against resistant mutations and/or inhibition of alternative pathways.",

Therefore, this review focuses on epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation, post-translational histone modifications, and RNA interference via small noncoding RNAs, which play a critical role in controlling gene expression and are targets of dysregulation in many hematologic malignancies.

     "abstract": "Cytotoxic chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) usually produces only temporary remissions, at the cost of significant toxicity and risk for death. One fundamental reason for treatment failure is that it is designed to activate apoptosis genes (eg, TP53) that may be unavailable because of mutation or deletion. Unlike deletion of apoptosis genes, genes that mediate cell cycle exit by differentiation are present in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and AML cells but are epigenetically repressed: MDS/AML cells express high levels of key lineage-specifying transcription factors. Mutations in these transcription factors (eg, CEBPA) or their cofactors (eg., RUNX1) affect transactivation function and produce epigenetic repression of late-differentiation genes that antagonize MYC. Importantly, this aberrant epigenetic repression can be redressed clinically by depleting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1, a central component of the epigenetic network that mediates transcription repression) using the deoxycytidine analogue decitabine at non-cytotoxic concentrations. The DNMT1 depletion is sufficient to trigger upregulation of late-differentiation genes and irreversible cell cycle exit by p53-independent differentiation mechanisms. Fortuitously, the same treatment maintains or increases self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells, which do not express high levels of lineage-specifying transcription factors. The biological rationale for this approach to therapy appears to apply to cancers other than MDS/AML also. Decitabine or 5-azacytidine dose and schedule can be rationalized to emphasize this mechanism of action, as an alternative or complement to conventional apoptosis-based oncotherapy.",

Promoter CpG methylation is correlated with silencing of tumor-suppressor genes (TSGs) in specific pathways that are also targets of mutation or other mechanisms of inactivation, and is thought to contribute to disease progression and poor prognosis. Epigenetic contributions to myeloid pathogenesis are more complex. Examples include TSG inactivation and oncogenic activation associated with formation of altered chromatin separate from CpG methylation. Epigenetic dysregulation occurs at multiple disease stages and at non-CpG island genomic sites, and also includes genomic hypomethylation and small RNA mechanisms of epigenetic regulation. Identification of recurrent mutations in potential epigenetic regulators, including TET2, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, UTX, and ASXL1, were recently described. Accordingly, therapeutics directed towards epigenetic mechanisms including methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors have had some clinical success when applied to MDS and AML. However, identification of the underlying mechanisms associated with clinical responses and drug resistance remain enigmatic. Remarkably, in spite of significant molecular and translational progress, there are currently no epigenetic biomarkers in widespread clinical use.

These aberrations of the miRNome (defined as the full spectrum of miRNAs in a given genome) occur at several levels, including primary tumors and patient body fluids (such as blood and sputum), suggesting that miRNAs can be effectively used as biological markers with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive implications.

Heterozygous loss of the RPS14 gene on 5q leads to activation of p53 in the erythroid lineage and the macrocytic anemia characteristic of the 5q-syndrome. The megakaryocytic and platelet phenotype of the 5q-syndrome has been attributed to heterozygous deletion of miR145 and miR146a.

The WHO classification-based prognostic scoring system (WPSS) is able to classify MDS patients into five risk groups showing different survivals and probabilities of leukemic evolution. The WPSS is able to predict survival and leukemia progression at any time during follow-up, and can therefore be used for implementing risk-adapted treatment strategies in patients with primary MDS.

     "abstract": "The pathophysiology of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) is multiple, complex, and poorly understood. In some cases of MDS, especially those in which the bone marrow is hypocellular, there is increasing experimental and clinical indication that an immune-mediated damage to hematopoietic precursors and changes in the hematopoiesis-supporting microenvironment contribute to disease development. Increased serum levels of type-1 cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3), and oligoclonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells are observed in human MDS. In some cases, the immunologic attack to the marrow appears to be triggered by MDS-specific antigens, damaging the microenvironment and inducing cell apoptosis especially of normal progenitors. In murine models, dysregulation of osteoprogenitors leads to disrupted hematopoiesis of healthy hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells, eventually resulting in MDS and leukemia. In hypocellular MDS, marrow failure appears to be not only the result of ineffective erythropoiesis of abnormal clones, but also due to inhibition of normal progenitors. Immunosuppressive therapy with cyclosporine, anti-thymocyte globulin, or alemtuzumab may alleviate cytopenias and in some instances induce cytogenetic remission. However, not all patients respond to immunosuppression, and the identification of relevant biomarkers for an immune mechanism is necessary to identify those patients who may benefit from this treatment modality.",

They have been shown to improve transfusion requirements and to change the natural history of the disease. However, with increasing cumulative clinical experience, it has become apparent that these agents are not curative and have their own shortcomings. There is a subgroup of patients who do not respond to frontline therapy and a large, growing cohort of patients that lose response or progress while on hypomethylating agent\u2013based therapy. There are no standard treatment options in this arena and it is therefore a focus of significant research interest. Since the mechanisms of resistance to hypomethylating agents are not known, selection of therapy is largely empiric but must take into account the age, comorbidities, and performance status of the patient, as well as the characteristics of the disease at the time of treatment failure. Higher intensity approaches and allogeneic stem cell transplant can yield improved response rates and long-term disease control but should be limited to a selected cohort of patients who can tolerate the treatment-related morbidities. For the majority of patients who likely will be better candidates for lower intensity therapy, several novel, investigational approaches are becoming available. Among these are newer nucleoside analogues, inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinases, molecules that interact with redox signaling within the cell, immunotherapy approaches, and others. Patients with MDS whose disease has failed to respond to hypomethylating agent therapy should be referred for clinical trials when available. As we learn more about the patterns and mechanisms of failure, the next challenge will be to determine which therapies are suitable for each individual patient.",

     "abstract": "Approximately one third of patients diagnosed with early-stage colon cancer will present with lymph node involvement (stage III) and about one quarter with transmural bowel wall invasion but negative lymph nodes (stage II). Adjuvant chemotherapy targets micrometastatic disease to improve disease-free (DFS) and overall survival (OS). While beneficial for stage III patients, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy is unestablished in stage II disease. This likely relates to the improved outcome of these patients, and the difficulties in developing studies with sufficient power to document benefit in this patient population. However, recent investigation also suggests that molecular differences may exist between stage II and III cancers and within stage II patients. Validated pathologic prognostic markers are useful at identifying stage II patients at high risk for recurrence for whom the benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy may be greater. Such high-risk features include higher T stage (T4 v T3), suboptimal lymph node retrieval, presence of lymphovascular invasion, bowel obstruction, or bowel perforation, and poorly differentiated histology. However, for the majority of patients who do not carry any of these adverse features and are classified as \u201caverage-risk\u201d stage II patients, the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy remains unproven. Emerging understanding of the underlying biology of stage II colon cancer has identified molecular markers that may change this paradigm and improve our risk assessment and treatment choices for stage II disease. Assessment of microsatellite stability (MSI), which serves as a marker for DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system function, has emerged as a useful tool for risk stratification of patients with stage II colon cancer. Patients with high frequency of MSI have been shown to have increased OS and limited benefit from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)\u2013based chemotherapy.

However, data are emerging of factors that may influence disease recurrences and mortality for colorectal cancer survivors.

In high-income countries, palliative care improves outcomes for patients, caregivers, provider organizations, and health systems. Data are not yet available to demonstrate similar benefits in low- and middle-income countries, where access to even the most basic palliative interventions (eg, opioids for pain management) is inadequate and unevenly distributed. This article describes current global disparities in the availability of palliative care. We make the case for international prioritization of palliative care as a critical strategy for improving outcomes for people with cancer and their caregivers worldwide.",

     "abstract": "This article seeks to address the question: Is best supportive care (BSC) in research a euphemism for no care or a standard of good care? The data regarding the ethical and methodological validity of BSC studies are reviewed. Most of the BSC studies published over the past 25 years are really treatment versus no treatment studies represented as BSC studies. By ignoring the best contemporaneous standards of BSC, standardizing practices in multicenter studies, validating participating centers, or documenting treatment delivery, researchers belie the stated intention of studying BSC. Most studies sought to evaluate if there was any benefit of a new anti-tumor treatment versus discontinuation of anti-tumor therapies. Overwhelmingly, and with few exceptions, the impact of BSC practices was not really part of the key research question. To be ethical and methodologically valid, BSC studies must incorporate standards consistent with contemporaneous, proven BSC practice standards. Work is underway to develop widely validated standards of practice for the control arm of best supportive care studies. These can be readily incorporated in to study development and evaluation.",

     "abstract": "Traditionally, anticancer therapy has focused on eradication of neoplastic tissue, predominantly by invasive and/or toxic treatments. In modern studies, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have become more common, and give a true picture of toxicity. Increased consideration of subjective patient perspectives of anticancer treatments has allowed a notable shift within supportive oncology. Disparity exists between physician and patient perspectives of symptom severity, despite several common scoring methods. PROs are vital tools in the overall assessment of chronic illnesses, including cancer and associated treatments. Synergistic assessments of objective and subjective observations of symptoms and function are most accurate. PROs include information collected either in a clinic or by a diary system. Patient self-reporting, like any other assessment of health status, is not an absolute measure. Electronic data collection is an increasingly useful way to monitor PROs. Factors that influence quality of life (QOL) are predominantly subjective experiences, and can occur concurrently with pre-existing symptoms, which increases symptom burden. There are several validated systems for assessing PROs; some are concerned with specific conditions like mucositis (Oral Mucositis Weekly Questionnaire [OMDQ]), whereas others cover chronic illness in general (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System [PROMIS]). The PROMIS framework was developed by the National Health Institute (NHI) to standardize self-reported health measurements within chronic illnesses, including pain, fatigue and emotional distress. The general Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-G) scale was developed to assess many different types of cancer; we will discuss use in oral mucositis as a model. There is more to measuring toxicity than the clinician's objective view of the patient experience. There is still much to be done to validate all the necessary PRO tools so that we can competently measure both toxicity and toxicity-reduction strategies. Current systems to assess PROs continue to have a very positive impact on supportive oncology.",

     "abstract": "In developed countries the survival rate of children with cancer exceeds 75%. Optimal supportive care is necessary to deliver the burdensome treatment protocols. As the intensity of primary treatment has escalated, so have the side effects like myelosuppression and infection. Children who receive aggressive chemotherapy have an approximately 40% chance of experiencing a febrile episode during neutropenia. Patients should be treated with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics even if they have been assessed as low risk. There is no proof of the usefulness of special measures concerning food products during neutropenia. In contrast to adults, most children who receive chemotherapy will have a central venous catheter inserted (\u226580\u201390%). The two most important complications are infections and thrombosis. The Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer (MASCC) guideline in adult oncology is available to prevent and treat nausea and vomiting. In highly emetogenic chemotherapy, the combination of a serotonin receptor antagonist plus a corticosteroid should be used. Pain in children with cancer is mainly therapy- or procedure-related. As in adults, the stepladder of the World Health Organization (WHO) is used as a guideline for adequate treatment of pain. It is of utmost importance that children receive optimal pain management during the initial procedures. Sedation is performed in many different ways. Palliative care starts with information about the incurability of the disease for parents, the patient, and the professionals involved. Children in palliative care for progressive cancer should be at home as much as possible, even in the terminal phase. The organization of health care and the facilities differ at a national level, so the requirements and choices for optimal care vary by country. Palliative care has to be incorporated into the structural base in the training of pediatricians and pediatric nurses. The first goal of palliative care is to reduce distressing symptoms. During the whole period of palliative care stepwise withdrawal and withholding of treatment options are important issues. The multidisciplinary approach should also span the broad field of psychosocial issues covering both the child's and the caregiver's specific psychosocial needs. Continuity of care is also depicted by contacts afterwards during family bereavement.",

Although it is one of the most effective drugs for treating breast cancer, tamoxifen is not effective in all estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients, and it is frequently associated with side effects, such as hot flashes. Relative resistance to tamoxifen treatment may be a result, in part, from impaired drug activation by cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Indeed, recent studies have identified allelic variations in CYP2D6 to be an important determinant of tamoxifen's activity (and toxicity). This article will summarize the current information regarding the influence of the major genotypes and CYP2D6 inhibitors on tamoxifen metabolism, with a focus on its clinical utility and the current level of evidence for CYP2D6 genotyping of patients who are candidates for tamoxifen treatment.",

The traditional approach of surgical resection for early-stage disease, potentially followed by chemotherapy, as well chemotherapy (with or without radiation) in later stages of disease is being supplemented with a personalized approach. The personalized approach has classically been used by the oncologist based on clinical/pathological parameters such as the performance status of the patient and histology of lung cancer. As molecular mechanisms have been explored in lung cancer more recently, the personalized approach also has incorporated molecular abnormalities. In particular, EGFR, K-ras, ALK, MET, CBL, and COX2, have come to the forefront as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Thus, we review the various molecular mechanisms in lung cancer and the role of novel therapeutics.",

With the introduction of a number of novel agents, both traditional chemotherapies and biologically targeted agents, the need to identify subgroups that are likely and not likely to respond to a particular treatment regimen is paramount. This will allow patients who are likely to benefit to receive optimal care, while sparing those unlikely to benefit from unnecessary toxicity and cost. With the identification of several novel biomarkers and a variety of technologies to interrogate the genome, we already are able to rapidly study patient tumor or blood samples and normal tissues to generate a large dataset of aberrations within the cancer. How to digest this complex information to obtain accurate, reliable, and meaningful results that will allow us to provide truly personalized care for CC patients is just starting to be addressed.

PCa has an increased incidence and prevalence in older men. Age-associated incidence is on the rise due to increased screening in the older population. This has led to a sharp rise in the detection of early stage PCa. Given the indolent nature of many prostatic malignancies, a large proportion of older men with PCa will ultimately die from other causes. As a result, physicians and patients are faced with the challenge of identifying optimal treatment strategies for localized PCa, biochemically recurrent PCa and later-stage PCa. Age-related changes can impact tolerance of hormonal therapy and chemotherapy in men with metastatic disease and shift the risk-benefit ratio of these treatments. Tools such as the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) can help estimate remaining life expectancy and can help predict treatment-related morbidity and mortality in older men. Application of CGA in older men with PCa is important to help individualize and optimize treatment strategies. Research that integrates multidisciplinary and multidimensional assessment of PCa and the patient's overall health status is needed.",

A review of CT technology is provided, at a level of detail appropriate for a busy clinician to review. The basis of x-ray CT dosimetry is also discussed, and concepts of absorbed dose and effective dose (ED) are distinguished. Absorbed dose is a physical quantity (measured in milligray [mGy]) equal to the x-ray energy deposited in a mass of tissue, whereas ED uses an organ-specific weighting method that converts organ doses to ED measured in millisieverts (mSv). The organ weighting values carry with them a measure of radiation risk, and so ED (in mSv) is not a physical dose metric but rather is one that conveys radiation risk. The use of CT in a cancer surveillance protocol was used as an example of a pediatric patient who had kidney cancer, with surgery and radiation therapy. The active use of CT for cancer surveillance along with diagnostic CT scans led to a total of 50 CT scans performed on this child in a 7-year period. It was estimated that the patient received an average organ dose of 431 mGy from these CT scans. By comparison, the radiation therapy was performed and delivered 50.4 Gy to the patient's abdomen.

     "abstract": "During the past decade, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have revolutionized the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), providing new treatment options with unprecedented clinical benefit. Recognition of the key role played by the receptor tyrosine kinases KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFR\u03b1) in the pathogenesis of GIST led to the development of imatinib, the first TKI for this indication and the current first-line standard of care for unresectable or metastatic GIST. However, the clinical efficacy of imatinib is limited by two concerns: the rare patient-specific intolerance to the drug, and the fact that the majority of patients will eventually develop treatment-refractory disease that is resistant to this selective TKI. Although sunitinib has been approved worldwide as second-line therapy for GIST following failure of imatinib, the benefits of sunitinib in treating GIST following imatinib failure are most often more limited than first-line therapy, with emergence of treatment-resistant disease in less than 1 year. Other TKIs studied in clinical trials for GIST include a wide range of different agents, such as sorafenib, dasatinib, pazopanib, regorafenib, masitinib, and nilotinib. Each agent differs in its selectivity for individual tyrosine kinases, conferring each with distinct properties that determine clinical safety and efficacy. No agent has yet reached regulatory approval for management of GIST following the failure of both imatinib and sunitinib. This review highlights relevant differences and similarities in the structures and functions, including kinase selectivity and mechanisms of binding, of the currently approved TKIs and certain others in development for the treatment of advanced GIST. In addition, the ability of some TKIs to inhibit alternative targets with potency similar to or greater than their intended primary target (pleiotropic effects) is also discussed.",

In addition, the phase III trial of nilotinib versus best supportive care (with or without a TKI at the investigator\u2019s discretion) indicated that nilotinib may have efficacy in some third-line patients. Furthermore, the Evaluating Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials (ENEST g1 trial), a phase III randomized, open-label study comparing the safety and efficacy of imatinib versus nilotinib in the first-line treatment of patients with GIST, is currently under way.

Of these treatments, surgery is the cornerstone of initial management. Most patients should undergo thyroidectomy with concomitant central neck (level VI) lymph node dissection. On the other hand, thyroidectomy alone may be appropriate for patients with smaller tumors (T1 or T2) and no evidence of suspicious lymphadenopathy. Surgery is also indicated in cases of cervical lymph node metastases and locoregional recurrence. The principal adjuvant therapy is radioactive iodine, which should be considered in patients with a high risk of locoregional recurrence or with metastatic disease. Similarly, suppression of endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone is recommended in patients with an elevated risk of recurrence. External-beam radiotherapy is indicated in patients with gross extrathyroidal extension or residual disease not amenable to surgery.

Inactivation of the HRPT2/CDC73 gene, encoding the putative tumor-suppressor protein parafibromin and discovered in the context of the hyperparathyroidism\u2013jaw tumor (HPT-JT) syndrome, is a common, somatic event in most parathyroid cancers. Approximately 25% of patients with apparently sporadic parathyroid cancer carry germline HRPT2/CDC73 mutation. Germline DNA analysis for HRPT2/CDC73 mutation is recommended in all patients with parathyroid cancer because of the potential benefit for first-degree relatives, who should nevertheless undergo serum calcium screening. The histopathologic diagnosis of parathyroid cancer is nonspecific unless vascular, lymphatic, capsular, or soft tissue invasion is seen, or metastases are clinically evident. Immunohistochemical analysis of parathyroid tumors for loss of parafibromin expression offers promise as a diagnostic tool. En bloc tumor resection offers the highest chance of cure in patients with suspected parathyroid carcinoma.

They represent a heterogeneous group with very varying tumor biology and prognosis. About half of the patients present clinical symptoms and syndromes related to substances released from the tumors (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, insulinoma, glucagonoma, etc) and the other half are so-called nonfunctioning tumors mainly presenting with symptoms such as obstruction, jaundice, bleeding, and abdominal mass. Ten percent to 15% of the pancreatic endocrine tumors are part of an inherited syndrome such as multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN-1), von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), neurofibromatosis, or tuberousclerosis. The diagnosis is based on histopathology demonstrating neuroendocrine features such as positive staining for chromogranin A and specific hormones such as gastrin, proinsulin, and glucagon. Moreover, the biochemical diagnosis includes measurement of chromogranins A and B or specific hormones such as gastrin, insulin, glucagon, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the circulation. In addition to standard localization procedures, radiology (computed tomography [CT] scan, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], ultrasound [US]), somatostatin receptor scintigraphy, and most recently positron emission tomography with specific isotopes such as 11C-5 hydroxytryptamin (11C-5-HTP), fluorodopa and 68Ga-1,4,7,10-tetra-azacyclododecane-N,N\u2032,N\u2033,N\u2034-tetra-acetic acid (DOTA)-octreotate are performed. Surgery is still one of the cornerstones in the management of pancreatic endocrine tumors, but curative surgery is rarely obtained in most cases because of metastatic disease. Debulking and other cytoreductive procedures might facilitate systemic treatment. Cytotoxic drugs, biological agents, such as somatostatin analogs, alpha interferons, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are routinely used. Tumor-targeted radioactive treatment is available in many centres in Europe and is effective in patients with tumors that express high content of somatostatin receptors type 2 and 5. In the future, treatment will be based on tumor biology and molecular genetics with the aim of so-called personalized medicine.",

     "abstract": "Adrenocortical cancer (ACC) is a rare, challenging disease with a broad range of clinical presentations. Often presenting in an advanced stage with a large, locally invasive primary tumor or with Cushing's syndrome, it requires a multidisciplinary approach to treatment. We discuss controversies in the evaluation and management of ACC. We conclude that the role of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) remains unclear and that it should be employed sparingly. Biopsies should be performed only when metastatic disease is present and a primary tumor has not been clearly established. Care should be taken in using the Weiss criteria to make decisions regarding prognosis. Surgery is the preferred intervention initially and at the time of recurrence, and every effort should be made to attempt a surgical resection. The latter should be an open resection; laparoscopic resection should not be performed if there is a high suspicion of ACC. The use of mitotane in patients without evidence of disease remains controversial. Systemic chemotherapy is effective in patients with widely metastatic disease or as an adjunct to a surgical intervention and should focus on regimens that have been shown to effect responses; \u201cnovel targeted therapies\u201d should not be employed as first-line treatment. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation can be very helpful but are still under evaluation; embolization with or without chemotherapy may be used as a surgical adjunct. The role of radiation remains to be defined. Finally, physicians caring for these patients need to recognize that Cushing's disease is a debilitating problem that should be managed aggressively; expecting chemotherapy to solve this complication is not appropriate.",

Metastases are expected to be present at the time of diagnosis in more than 10% of these patients. Measurement of plasma and urinary metanephrine levels is well established in diagnosing PGL. Recently, a dopaminergic phenotype (excess dopamine or methoxytyramine) was recognized as a good indicator of metastatic disease. Vast progress in targeted positron emission tomography (PET) imaging (eg, 18F-FDA, 18F-FDOPA, 18F-FDG) now allows for reliable early detection of metastatic disease. However, once metastases are present, treatment options are limited. Survival of patients with metastatic PGL is variable, and frequently short.

Understanding how these tumors work benefits from an appreciation of adrenal steroid biosynthesis, as it is said that secretion in cancers is an anarchic version of normal adrenal function. Selection of patients in whom we should have a high suspicion of a malignancy is vital, so that biochemical investigation and imaging is deployed appropriately. When an adrenal tumor is found to secrete androgens or estrogens to excess, it can be difficult to confirm that it is a cancer, as there is significant overlap in the secretory patterns and imaging appearances of benign and malignant disease. The most reliable indicator of malignancy in these tumors remains the presence of metastases. Treatment is essentially surgical, although the role of mitotane is one undergoing evaluation.",

When necessary, other diagnostic procedures such as functional imaging and fine-needle biopsy (FNB) can be considered in selected cases. Surgical removal is recommended for clinically relevant hypersecretory masses, as well as for masses suspected to be malignant. Most frequently, adrenal incidentalomas (AIs) are represented by benign cortical adenomas, a subset of which causes a mild hypercortisolism, known as subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCS).

     "abstract": "Much of the recent excitement in the translational field of tumor immunology and immunotherapy has been generated by the recognition that immune checkpoint proteins can be blocked by human antibodies with profound effects in vitro, in animal tumor systems, and in patients. Promising clinical data have already been generated in melanoma and other tumor types with human antibodies directed against cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). The preclinical data that supported the clinical development of these two antibodies will be discussed in detail in this review, showing that many of the therapeutic effects of these two agents were predicted by the animal models, as were the immune-related side effects noted with these drugs. In contrast, much of the early work with anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibodies indicated that it had a potent therapeutic effect only when combined with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)\u2013transduced tumor vaccines, and that the antibody alone was effective only in the most immunogenic tumor models in mice. Intriguingly, in patients, the drug alone clearly has had important therapeutic effects, but the addition of vaccines has not added to its clinical benefit. Murine experiments also suggested that CTLA-4 abrogation might function via important effects on natural T-regulatory cells that were CD4+, CD25+high, and FOXp3+, but this has not been borne out in experiments using peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients treated with anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibodies, and unlike in animals, in humans the exact mechanism(s) by which CTLA-4 abrogation induced an anti-tumor effect is still unclear. Abrogation of PD-1 functions via different immune signaling pathways than CTLA-4 and is likely to have a different spectrum of effects than blocking CTLA-4. For PD-1 blockade, murine experiments have suggested that the antibody alone and combined with adoptive cell transfer or vaccine approaches would be therapeutically beneficial, and that clear effects on T-cell proliferation and activation, as well as T-regulatory cell function would be observed in patients. The clinical development of anti\u2013PD-1 antibody so far has shown that it has a potent effect when administered alone, and trials of vaccines with anti\u2013PD-1 are just being initiated to test the idea that the predicted effects of that antibody observed in animal systems also would be seen in patients. These observations support the idea that animal preclinical therapeutic experiments are an important guide to the conduct of trials employing abrogation of immune checkpoint proteins in T cells in patients. Nonetheless, clinical investigators must be flexible and prepared to find that the biology of those systems may be very different in humans compared to mice.",

Ipilimumab is a novel targeted human immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen4 (CTLA-4), an immune-inhibitory site expressed on activated T cells. Ipilimumab is well tolerated as an outpatient infusion therapy. Multiple studies have confirmed significant antimelanoma activity. A randomized trial has documented a survival benefit when ipilimumab was compared to a gp-100 vaccine only arm. The unique mechanism of action of ipilimumab makes assessment of response by conventional criteria difficult. Benefit from ipilimumab can occur after what would be considered progression with World Health Oganization (WHO) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. New immune response criteria have been proposed. Therapeutic responses peak between 12 and 24 weeks, with slow responses continuing up to and beyond 12 months. The major drug- related adverse side effects (10%\u201315% grade 3 or above) are immune-related and consist most commonly of rash, colitis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and hepatitis. Colonic perforation can occur and patients with diarrhea have to be monitored carefully with strict adherence to treatment algorithms.

The treatment of immune-related side effects with immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, does not appear to impair antitumor response.

This has led to adjuvant therapies that are not used uniformly or widely because of the rather marginal benefits, as no consistent and clinically significant impact on survival has been demonstrated. A new development for interferon-based adjuvant therapy seems to be the observation that better effects are observed in patients with lower tumor load and in patients with an ulcerated primary melanoma. A benefit for patients with more advanced lymphnodal involvement is quite unsure, clearly requiring new drugs to be explored. A new era in the treatment of melanoma treatment has arrived with the anti\u2013cytoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (anti\u2013CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies.

Surgical and radiation therapy improve the outcome of selected melanoma patients with brain metastasis, while systemic treatment using cytotoxic agents still plays a limited role. Temozolomide and fotemustine are preferentially used in melanoma patients with brain metastases in the United States and in Europe, respectively, with modest clinical activity. However, the results obtained with either agent are still limited, and efforts are needed to improve the outcome of these patients who are generally excluded from clinical trials. Among therapeutic agents in development, antibodies that block the interaction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\u2013associated antigen (CTLA-4) with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 and thus enhance antitumor immune responses have shown clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, including durable control of brain metastases.

The complex interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes as an immune response is strongly affected by anti-CD152 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, CTLA-4)-antibodies. However, specific CTLA-4 antibodies can block the CTLA-4 receptor and thus induce an unrestrained T-cell activation. To this stage, treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with the CTLA-4 antibodies ipilimumab and tremelimumab has only been investigated within clinical trials. The results of a phase III trial in patients with advanced disease treated with ipilimumab alone or in combination with a peptide vaccination (gp100) recently presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the Ameircan Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) made groundbreaking news as ipilimumab was demonstrated to be the first drug in melanoma treatment to show a significant prolongation of survival time. Patients undergoing treatment with CTLA-4 antibodies may experience immune-related phenomena and adverse events (irAEs) that differ greatly from the well-known adverse events of cytotoxic drugs and which are due to the CTLA-4 antibodies\u2032 specific mode of action.

Animal studies first provided insight into the ability of an anti\u2013CTLA-4 antibody to cause tumor regression, particularly in combination regimens. Early clinical studies defined ipilimumab pharmacokinetics and possibilities for combinability. Phase II trials of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma showed objective responses, but a greater number of patients had disease stabilization. In a phase III trial, ipilimumab was the first agent to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival in patients with previously treated, advanced melanoma. The adverse event profile associated with ipilimumab was primarily immune-related. Adverse events can be severe and life-threatening, but most were reversible using treatment guidelines. Ipilimumab monotherapy exhibits conventional and new patterns of activity in advanced melanoma, with a delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The observation of some new response patterns with ipilimumab, which are not captured by standard response criteria, led to novel criteria for the evaluation of immunotherapy in solid tumors.

The observations made in these models as well as other data are then used to prioritize agents to determine which are qualified to progress to clinical chemoprevention trials. Organ-specific animal models are employed to determine which agents or classes of agents are likely to be the most effective at nontoxic doses to prevent organ-specific forms of cancer. These results are then used to target specific organs in high-risk populations in clinical trials. The animal models used are either carcinogen-induced with carcinogens specific for particular organ sites or they are transgenic/mutant animals with insertions, deletions, or mutations at targeted gene sites known to enhance cancers in a specific organ. Animal tumor models with characteristics favorable to chemoprevention studies are available for cancers of the lung, colon, skin, bladder, mammary, prostate, head and neck, esophagus, ovary, and pancreas. In addition to single-agent dose-response testing, such models are frequently used for testing combinations of agents, testing different routes of administration, evaluating surrogate endpoint biomarkers, and generating initial pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. For some of the more standard animal models there is significant correlation with human chemopreventive trial results. There are a growing number of positive human chemoprevention trials that have used agents or combinations that were positive in animal testing. There have been fewer negative human clinical trials, but their results again correlate with negative animal results. Clearly the validation of animal models to predict the efficacy of agents in human clinical trials will await further human data on positive and negative outcomes with chemopreventive agents.

     "abstract": "One of the major questions in preclinical testing of potential cancer preventive agents is how to most closely approximate the testing protocol to be employed in phase III prevention trials. The nature of tumors arising in situ in animals allows one to initiate agent exposure from the time of tumor initiation until the time that preinvasive lesions already exist. The large phase III prevention trials have routinely followed participants for 3 to 7 years until a cancer endpoint, which generally implies that the timing of the intervention occurs further along during tumor progression. The objective of preclinical testing is to identify agents for large-scale phase III trials. Accordingly, initiating the tested intervention in preclinical studies later in the tumor progression process is more appropriate for any agent being proposed for phase III clinical trials. Furthermore, cancer, rather than advanced dysplastic lesions or other molecular markers (gene or protein expression), is the preferred primary endpoint. However, simultaneous examination of earlier designated \u201cintermediate\u201d endpoints (hyperplasias, dysplasias, or molecular markers) to determine whether their modulation correlates with that of the primary tumor endpoint would be useful, since these latter endpoints may be employed in phase II prevention trials.",

     "abstract": "With biomolecular evidence accumulating at an exponential rate, there will be a surge in the development of targeted cancer prevention drugs and interventions in the next decade. Promising results from clinical treatment trials identify a spectrum of targeted cancer therapies in several broad categories. These include both small molecule inhibitors of either key receptors or enzyme binding sites, as well as intravenously delivered monoclonal antibodies that block a specific binding interaction between ligands and their receptors. These targeted interventions conform to a basic translational algorithm: biomarker present, biomarker modulated, and biomarker clinically relevant. A review of solid tumor targets provides a manageable list of factors that are critical to cancer cell survival. As such, these targets represent factors that are not only clinically relevant but also may play a critical role in early tumor development prior to the evolution of frank invasive malignancy. This possibility qualifies these targets for consideration in the development of cancer prevention interventions. Among solid tumors, the treatment of breast cancer with targeted drugs has a long record benchmarked by the initial US Food and Drug Administation (FDA) approval of tamoxifen for metastatic breast cancer treatment in 1977. Since then, the list of oncology drug targets has expanded to include aromatase, androgen receptor, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family, and others. It is not surprising that tamoxifen was the first of the modern targeted therapies to be approved for cancer risk reduction and additional approvals are anticipated. The focus of this review is the pharmacologic manipulation of targets within epithelial tumor cells and the implication of those targets for intervening to suppress and eliminate premalignant cells in human tissue. Major obstacles to prevention drug development can be addressed by attention to two important areas. One of these is the refinement of early phase prevention trials to identify drug targets in epithelial cells that are at demonstrated risk of evolving into cancer cells, ie, cells from a developmental niche in cancer ontogeny. Early results suggest that molecular risk signatures may allow the investigational identification of molecular targets in premalignant tissue, with the possibility that chemoprevention agents can be used to eliminate the risk signature. To the extent that this approach can be developed, it will allow for cancer risk reduction in a way that is analogous to the measurement of tumor response to treatment. Even with improvements in the efficiency of clinical trials that come from using molecular risk signatures, there is an ever-growing list of chemoprevention agents that are candidates for evaluation. Improved prevention drug screening methodologies are therefore needed to prioritize agents for clinical testing. In addition to drug targets located in epithelial tumor cells, another list of malignancy-associated targets could be generated by considering targets in tumor-associated stromal and endothelial cells (eg, fibroblast growth factor [FGF], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]), as well as targets related to a systemic reservoir of circulating cells that can be recruited to carcinogenic influence by inflammatory factors such as nuclear factor (NF)\u03baB. The complementarities of target-related processes within tumors cells, in the tumor microenvironment, and beyond suggests that there is great potential for multi-targeted approaches that may be more effective than single agents and also less prone to resistance. Additional options, related to drug dose and schedule, remain to be established. As long as multiple agents can be used in combination for optimal effect with acceptable toxicity, the co-targeting of the epithelial cell compartment along with other compartments of oncogenic activity is expected to expand the dimensions of targeted prevention and enhance the overall opportunity to eliminate precancer or cells at risk of eventually transitioning to invasive cancer.",

Phase II trials vary considerably in their endpoints, cohorts, and designs due to differences in the process of carcinogenesis and ability to sample tissues across different target organs. However, the goal of all such trials is to provide evidence of interference with the development of cancer and to identify safety signals that would limit the benefit from interventions.",

An emphasis on prevention has been increasing in view of a persisting high incidence of disease. Seventy percent of breast cancers are estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, and are therefore presumed to be hormone-responsive and potentially treatable or preventable by anti-estrogenic agents. To date, the large, phase III randomized controlled breast cancer prevention trials have tested and are testing only hormonal drugs designed to antagonize the carcinogenic effect of endogenous estrogen; these agents are either selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) or aromatase inhibitors (AIs). The SERMs, tamoxifen and raloxifene, have been shown in these large trials to reduce the risk of ER-positive breast cancers; prevention trials of AIs are ongoing. Interest is now focusing on developing agents with a broader spectrum of preventive activity, particularly with regard to ER-negative subtypes of breast cancer. A number of phase I and II trials using tissue-derived surrogate endpoint biomarkers (SEBs) as outcomes have been implemented. These smaller trials address prevention not only of ER-negative but also ER-positive breast cancers, since approximately 50% of the latter have been shown to be resistant to the estrogen-targeting drugs used in the large trials. Issues of importance in these smaller trials include choice of agent, selection of appropriate trial participants, trial design, method of access to breast tissue in women without cancer, selection and monitoring of SEBs, and monitoring of drug toxicity.",

ER\u2212 tumors fail to respond to current established targeted therapies, whether for treatment or prevention.

Furthermore, among premenopausal women, the three subsets occur more frequently in women of African descent compared to white women with breast cancer.

By contrast, phase III trials test agents for their efficacy in cancer prevention in thousands of participants who are generally healthy or may be at slightly elevated risk.

Its history developed in tandem with that of the periodic health examination, in which any deviations\u2014subtle or glaring\u2014from a clearly demarcated \u201cnormal\u201d were to be rooted out, given the underlying hypothesis that diseases develop along progressive linear paths of increasing abnormalities. This model of disease development drove the logical deduction that early detection, by \u201cbreaking the chain\u201d of cancer development, must be of benefit to affected individuals. In the latter half of the 20th century, researchers and guidelines organizations began to explicitly challenge the core assumptions underpinning many clinical practices. A move away from intuitive thinking began with the development of evidence-based medicine. One key method developed to explicitly quantify the overall risk\u2013benefit profile of a given procedure was the analytic framework. The shift away from pure deductive reasoning and reliance on personal observation was driven, in part, by a rising awareness of critical biases in cancer screening that can mislead clinicians, including healthy volunteer bias, length-biased sampling, lead-time bias, and overdiagnosis. A new focus on the net balance of both benefits and harms when determining the overall worth of an intervention also arose: it was recognized that the potential downsides of early detection were frequently overlooked or discounted because screening is performed on basically healthy persons and initially involves relatively noninvasive methods. Although still inconsistently applied to early detection programs, policies, and belief systems in the United States, an evidence-based approach is essential to counteract the misleading\u2014even potentially harmful\u2014allure of intuition and individual observation.",

     "abstract": "A common belief is that the earlier that cancer is detected, the better the chance exists for reduced mortality and morbidity. The advent of new and emerging molecular, genetic, and imaging technologies has broadened the possible strategies for early detection and prevention, but a beneficial impact on mortality needs to be supported by clinical evidence. Molecular markers are being identified that are enhancing our ability to predict and detect cancer before it develops and at the earliest signs of impending carcinogenic transformation. Of the innumerable molecular markers in development, a standalone early detection marker with acceptable sensitivity and specificity is available for bladder cancer, although for most cancer sites there are promising avenues of research that will likely produce results in the next decade. The perfect molecular marker would be one that is inherently related to the disease, specifically to the processes of malignant tumorigenesis or to the defense mechanisms of the individual. For example, mutations associated with increased cancer risk often produce gene products that interfere with tumor-suppressor pathways (eg, DNA repair or cell-cycle control) or support oncogenic pathways (eg, through genetic instability or silencing the apoptotic pathway). Finding molecular markers associated with these processes, and where in the process they produce their actions, can lead to interventions based on maintaining support for the normal process and interrupting the action of the products of the mutation. The search for molecular markers for cancer prevention and early detection presents a formidable challenge that requires a systematic and scientifically sound validation process. The search encompasses a broad range of scientific disciplines, including biochemistry, genetics, histology, immunology, informatic technologies, and epidemiology; strategies to identify and understand molecular markers are approached with multidisciplinary teams focused on understanding the mechanistic basis of cancer and the processes and pathways that underlie carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Botanical and nutritional compounds have been used for the treatment of cancer throughout history. These compounds also may be useful in the prevention of cancer. Population studies suggest that a reduced risk of cancer is associated with high consumption of vegetables and fruits. Thus, the cancer chemopreventive potential of naturally occurring phytochemicals is of great interest. There are numerous reports of cancer chemopreventive activity of dietary botanicals, including cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, Allium vegetables such as garlic and onion, green tea, Citrus fruits, soybeans, tomatoes, berries, and ginger, as well as medicinal plants. Several lead compounds, such as genistein (from soybeans), lycopene (from tomatoes), brassinin (from cruciferous vegetables), sulforaphane (from asparagus), indole-3-carbinol (from broccoli), and resveratrol (from grapes and peanuts) are in preclinical or clinical trials for cancer chemoprevention. Phytochemicals have great potential in cancer prevention because of their safety, low cost, and oral bioavailability. In this review, we discuss potential natural cancer preventive compounds and their mechanisms of action.",

     "abstract": "In this review, we briefly summarize some of the key developments in nutritional epidemiology and cancer over the past two decades with a focus on the strengths and limitations of study designs and dietary assessment methods. We present the evidence on dietary fat, meat, fiber, antioxidant nutrients, and calcium in relation to carcinogenesis from large cohort studies and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and refer to the conclusions of the 2007 World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research summary report. One prominent theme that emerged is the lack of concordance of results from RCTs and observational studies. There are multiple potential reasons for these discrepancies, including differences in study population, dose and timing of the exposure, adherence to an intervention, length of follow-up, and the primary endpoint. Therefore, null findings of RCTs do not necessarily indicate a lack of effect for the tested dietary factors on cancer risk, as some of these nutrients may have chemopreventive effects if given at the right time and in the right dose. It is likely that potential benefits from diet are due to a combination of food constituents rather than single components acting in isolation. Future efforts need to recognize the integrative nature of dietary exposures and attempt to study nutrients in the larger context of the foods and diets in which they are consumed.",

A review of the observational epidemiologic evidence and recent randomized exercise intervention trials on the association between physical activity and breast cancer risk is presented. As of March 2010, 73 separate studies out of 91 publications worldwide were identified as having sufficient data for this review. Across these 73 studies, the average reduction in breast cancer risk, when comparing the most to the least physically active women, was 25%. There also was evidence for a dose-response effect found in the majority of studies that examined this trend. The strongest associations were found for recreational and household activities and for activity that was of at least moderate intensity and sustained over a lifetime. Within population subgroups, a stronger effect was seen in women who are normal weight, in women without a family history of breast cancer, and in women who are parous. Women of all races benefitted from physical activity; however, a particularly strong effect on breast cancer risk was observed in non-Caucasian women. Future research should focus on elucidating the exact type, dose, and timing of physical activity required to reduce breast cancer risk. Prospective observational epidemiologic studies of lifetime physical activity patterns and breast cancer risk would help in this regard, as well as randomized controlled exercise intervention trials employing hypothesized biomarkers of breast cancer risk as outcome measures. Additional consideration to the role of sedentary behavior and light-intensity activity also is needed, as well as improved physical activity assessment methods. These additional data will be useful in improving public health recommendations regarding physical activity for breast cancer risk reduction.",

We built a rigorous, sequenced, graph-based strategy of network phenotyping analysis (NPA) to combine data smoothing to minimize stochasticity, multivariate analysis to identify ambiguity and prioritize key variables, and k-partite graphs to visualize coherence. In 890 unresectable HCC patients, we selected 13 baseline clinical variables. After rank ordering by survival, we found data structure that exhibited coherence between variables, implying heterogeneity in which survival varied depending on the associated variable profile. The NPA data compression identified five distinctive clinical phenotypes, based only on gender, age, and levels of serum bilirubin, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGTP). The phenotypic profiles for gender and age were substantially different. Young, male patients had a low survival, while elderly women had a long survival. Novel clusters included young men, with high AFP levels for their level of bilirubin, as well as women of all ages, with high GGTP values for their level of AFP. The identification of phenotypic groups of HCC may be of value in studies designed to understand their underlying pathophysiology.

Classification tables do present the results of models in more clinically relevant terms, but it is not always clear which of two models is preferable on the basis of a particular classification table, or even whether either model should be used at all. Recent years have seen the development of straightforward decision analytic techniques that evaluate prediction models in terms of their consequences.

The term \u201clearning curve\u201d is often used to describe the phenomenon. In supervised machine learning, the performance of classification algorithms often increases with the number of observations used to train the algorithm. We use progressively larger samples of observations to train the algorithm and then plot performance against the number of training observations. This yields the familiar negatively accelerating learning curve. To quantify the learning curve, we fit inverse power law models to the progressively sampled data. We fit such learning curves to four large clinical cancer genomic datasets, using three classifiers (diagonal linear discriminant analysis, K-nearest-neighbor with three neighbors, and support vector machines) and four values for the number of top genes included (5, 50, 500, 5,000). The inverse power law models fit the progressively sampled data reasonably well and showed considerable diversity when multiple classifiers are applied to the same data. Some classifiers showed rapid and continued increase in performance as the number of training samples increased, while others showed little if any improvement. Assessing classifier efficiency is particularly important in genomic studies since samples are so expensive to obtain. It is important to employ an algorithm that uses the predictive information efficiently, but with a modest number of training samples (>50), learning curves can be used to assess the predictive efficiency of classification algorithms.",

Bisphosphonates, a class of antiresorptive drugs, are now the mainstay of the treatment of skeletal-related events in myeloma bone disease and many solid cancers with bone metastases. Current evidence indicates that newer-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, are potent inhibitors of bone resorption.

In this review, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of currently available bone-targeted therapies including bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody in the treatment of bone metastasis due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma bone disease will be summarized.",

     "abstract": "Bisphosphonates are firmly entrenched in the treatment of metastatic bone disease secondary to several tumor types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and myeloma. More recently, an emerging body of preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates might also exhibit antitumor activity. This expanded role for bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting might have profound clinical implications in many cancer types, particularly in the context of prevention of bone metastasis. Increased understanding of the mechanistic basis of the antitumor effects indicates that these might occur via direct mechanisms such as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion, as well as indirect mechanisms such as inhibition of angiogenesis. There is also considerable evidence to suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates might exert additive or synergistic interactions with standard cytotoxic agents. However, mature clinical data with bisphosphonates are limited and, thus far, provide conflicting evidence regarding the antitumor role of bisphosphonates, but have mostly been conducted with first-generation bisphosphonates such as clodronate that are not as effective as next-generation bisphosphonates. Several large randomized clinical trials are ongoing with the next-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid to prospectively confirm an antitumor role for bisphosphonates in various tumor types. This review assesses the current body of preclinical and clinical evidence in favor of an antitumor effect of bisphosphonates in different cancer types.",

     "abstract": "Bisphosphonates are widely used to preserve and improve bone health in patients with cancer. Emerging evidence suggests that in addition to their effects on bone health, bisphosphonates may have anticancer activity. Some of the activity associated with bisphosphonates is observed in non-osteoclast cells; therefore, the bioavailability of bisphosphonates is briefly discussed. Structure-function correlations and the molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie bisphosphonate activity are also examined. In addition to a detailed discussion of the molecular interaction between nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase and the formation of cytotoxic triphosphoric acid 1-adenosin-5\u2032-yl ester 3-(3-methylbut-3-enyl) ester (ApppI), the effects of bisphosphonates on the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF)-\u03b2 pathway, the receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF\u03baB) ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin (OPG) axis, and novel molecular targets are reviewed. Finally, a basis for the observed preclinical and clinical activity of bisphosphonates, including effects on apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell invasion, modulation of immune function, and suppression of tumor-mediated angiogenesis, is provided.",

     "abstract": "Patients with breast cancer (BC) experience bone loss as a result of either cancer treatment or metastatic disease to the bone. In addition, baseline factors universally associated with bone loss have been identified, including history of fracture, menopausal status, oral corticosteroid use, osteoporosis, and smoking. Whereas treatment effects causing suppression of estrogen function or estrogen-deprivation are the predominant cause of bone loss and fractures among patients with earlier-stage disease, metastatic lesions to the bone are the principal drivers of bone loss and associated skeletal complications in patients with advanced disease. Development of fractures and other skeletal-related events (SREs) is associated with adverse clinical outcome. Several studies clearly have demonstrated the efficacy of bisphosphonates (BPs) in the metastatic setting. Recently, the targeted agent denosumab also demonstrated favorable efficacy in preventing SREs in this setting. In addition, clinical evidence has demonstrated that zoledronic acid (ZOL) can prevent bone loss and may provide an anticancer benefit in earlier-stage breast disease, supporting the potential use of early/concomitant intervention with BP therapy in the adjuvant setting. Overall, these data warrant further consideration of the role of bisphosphonates in BC. Ongoing studies will further investigate the bone-protective and potential anticancer benefits of BPs across all stages of breast disease.",

     "abstract": "Advanced multiple myeloma is typically accompanied by osteolytic bone lesions resulting from heightened osteolytic activity of osteoclasts and decreased rates of osteogenesis by osteoblasts. Therefore, patients with myeloma bone disease are at increased risk for skeletal-related events (SREs) such as pathologic fracture, the need for radiotherapy or surgery to bone, spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Each of these can reduce patients' functional independence, quality of life, and survival. Radiotherapy and surgery are often used to palliate bone pain and to stabilize, repair, or prevent bone fractures. Bisphosphonates (BPs) may reduce the risk of SREs. In particular, clodronate, pamidronate, and zoledronic acid (ZOL) have demonstrated efficacy for delaying the onset of potentially life-threatening SREs. Overall, BPs have a well established tolerability profile. The introduction of BPs for multiple myeloma was practice-changing, and patients now experience far fewer serious fractures and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Ongoing studies will help further refine and optimize the timing and duration of BP therapy in patients with myeloma bone disease.",

Maintaining bone health is important during all stages of PC, including patients who experience bone loss from androgen-deprivation therapy and patients who develop bone metastases. Patients with bone metastases often experience severe bone pain and are at increased risk for potentially debilitating skeletal-related events. Bisphosphonates are a well-established treatment option for patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and bone lesions from multiple myeloma. Zoledronic acid (ZOL) is the only bisphosphonate (BP) that has been extensively studied in patients with castration-recurrent PC and is indicated for treating patients with bone metastases from PC in conjunction with standard antineoplastic therapy. This review will examine the breadth of evidence supporting a role for ZOL and emerging therapies in managing patients with PC throughout the disease continuum.",

     "abstract": "Approximately 30% of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and 40% of patients with bladder cancer develop bone metastases that can disrupt normal bone homeostasis and place patients at risk for potentially life-limiting skeletal-related events (SREs). In the absence of bone-directed therapies, patients with RCC may experience up to four SREs per year. In patients with bone metastases from RCC or bladder cancer, zoledronic acid (ZOL) significantly reduced the risk of SREs compared with placebo. In addition to its bone-protective effects, preclinical and early clinical evidence indicates that ZOL prevents tumor progression. For example, retrospective subset analysis in patients with RCC indicated that ZOL extended time to disease progression and demonstrated a trend toward improved overall survival compared with placebo. Additionally, a study in patients with bone metastases from bladder cancer demonstrated that ZOL improved 1-year overall survival compared with placebo. Bone metastases place a heavy burden on patients with RCC or bladder cancer, and early, continuous treatment with ZOL may provide anticancer benefits in addition to important patient quality of life.",

     "abstract": "Bone metastases are a common complication in patients with advanced lung cancer, and most patients with bone metastases from lung cancer develop skeletal-related events (SREs). Skeletal-related events adversely impact patient quality of life and clinical outcome and are associated with increased costs of clinical management, underscoring the need for SRE prevention. Because current practice guidelines do not recommend pretreatment bone scans for all patients at initial presentation, skeletal involvement is not detected in a proportion of patients with early stage asymptomatic bone metastases. In addition, there are no uniform guidelines outlining treatment for patients with bone metastases. Although many bisphosphonates have not been investigated in this setting, zoledronic acid has proven efficacy in delaying the onset and reducing the risk of SREs in patients with bone metastases from lung cancer. Further, recent exploratory analyses in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors suggest that, in addition to normalizing biochemical markers of bone metabolism, zoledronic acid may improve survival in specific patient subsets, including those with lung cancer. Accordingly, several prospectively designed clinical trials assessing anticancer activity of zoledronic acid in the adjuvant setting are ongoing. New insights into the clinical relevance of bone-conserving therapy in patients with lung cancer are discussed.",

     "abstract": "Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, which is increased when cancer cells invade bone, and are used in the treatment of metastatic bone disease to reduce the risk of skeletal-related events. In addition, preclinical studies have shown that bisphosphonates, especially potent nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, have direct anticancer actions. Anticancer activity includes induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of invasion, in addition to synergistic activity with chemotherapy agents, antiangiogenic properties, and modulating effects on the immune system. In terms of potential clinical anticancer activity, early data suggest that zoledronic acid may have a role to play in preventing metastatic disease. The definitive answer is not known as yet; however, with more than 20,000 patients with breast, prostate, or lung cancer currently participating in adjuvant bisphosphonate randomized trials, results should be available in the next few years. This will establish whether bisphosphonates given early in the course of cancer will be able to prevent formation of metastases, in or out of the bone environment. This review will focus on emerging evidence of the anticancer activities of bisphosphonates and possible underlying mechanisms of action.",

In these settings, there is a suggested improvement in cancer-associated outcomes, in addition to their bone-protective benefits. Denosumab is a fully human antibody to the receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand.
