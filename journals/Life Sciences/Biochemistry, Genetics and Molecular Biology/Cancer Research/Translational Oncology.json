     "abstract": "The presence of Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) in the gut is associated with the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). F. nucleatum promotes tumor development by inducing inflammation and host immune response in the CRC microenvironment. Adhesion to the intestinal epithelium by the cell surface proteins FadA, Fap2 and RadD expressed by F. nucleatum can cause the host to produce inflammatory factors and recruit inflammatory cells, creating an environment which favors tumor growth. Furthermore, F. nucleatum can induce immune suppression of gut mucosa by suppressing the function of immune cells such as macrophages, T cells and natural killer cells, contributing the progression of CRC.",

     "abstract": "As a heterogeneous group of clonal disorders, acute myeloid leukemia with internal tandem duplication of fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) mutation usually shows an inferior prognosis. In the present study, we found that homoharringtonine (HHT), a protein translation inhibitor of plant alkaloid in China, exhibited potent cytotoxic effect against FLT3-ITD (+) cell lines and primary leukemia cells, and a remarkable synergistic anti-leukemia action was demonstrated in vitro and in vivo in xenograft mouse models when co-treated with the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor IPI504. Mechanistically, HHT combined with IPI504 synergistically inhibited the growth of leukemia cells by inducing apoptosis and G1 phase arrest. This synergistic action resulted in a prominent reduction of total and phosphorylated FLT3 (p-FLT3) as well as inhibition of its downstream signaling molecules such as STAT5, AKT, ERK and 4E-BP1. Furthermore, co-treatment of HHT and IPI504 led to a synergistic or additive effect on 55.56%(10/18) of acute myeloid leukemia cases tested, including three relapsed/refractory patients. In conclusion, our findings indicate that the combination of HHT and HSP90 inhibitor provides an alternative way for the treatment of FLT3-ITD positive acute myeloid leukemia, especially for relapsed/refractory AML.",

METHODS: Chinese patients aged \u226518\u202fyears with advanced melanoma previously treated with one line of therapy received pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 35 cycles or until confirmed disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or study withdrawal. Primary end points were objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 by blinded independent central review and safety. Key secondary end points included duration of response (DOR) and progression-free survival (PFS) per RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Median age was 52 years (N\u202f=\u202f103); 37.9% had acral and 14.6% had mucosal melanoma. Median follow-up was 7.9\u202fmonths at data cutoff (December 27, 2017).

Both members are essential for growth and survival of several types of human cancer cells; their role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), however, remains elusive. Here we reported that compared to adjacent normal tissues, both SAG and ROC1 are overexpressed in RCC, which is positively correlated with poor patient survival, particularly for SAG. Depletion of SAG or ROC1 inhibited growth and survival of RCC cells by inducing G2/M arrest, senescence, and apoptosis likely due to accumulation of WEE1, p21, p27, NOXA, and BIM. Interestingly, simultaneous BIM knockdown in RCC cells partially rescues growth suppression triggered by depletion of SAG, but not ROC1, suggesting a differential role of BIM. Collectively, our study provides the proof-of-concept evidence that RING components of CRL are attractive candidates for targeted therapy of RCC.",

     "publication date": "05-2019",
     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Type VI collagen (COL6) is associated with several pro-tumorigenic events. COL6 is primarily composed of three alpha-chains (a1-a3) forming a specialized microfibrillar network to support tissue architecture. COL6 homeostasis is lost in the tumor due to increased COL6 synthesis by activated fibroblast and altered proteolytic degradation by matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Consequently, pathology-specific COL6 fragments are released to the circulation. This study evaluates four COL6 fragments measured in serum as potential biomarkers for cancer. METHODS: C6Ma1 (MMP-generated neo-epitope on the a1 chain), C6Ma3 (MMP-generated neo-epitope on the a3 chain), PRO-C6 (C-terminal of the a3 chain) and IC-6 (internal epitope on the a1 chain) were measured by ELISA in serum from patients with various stage 1\u20134 cancer indications (n\u202f=\u202f4\u201311 per indication, total n\u202f=\u202f65) and healthy controls (n\u202f=\u202f13). RESULTS: C6Ma1 and C6Ma3 were significantly elevated in most cancer types compared to controls; PRO-C6 and IC6 were not. No significant differences were seen according to age, gender and TNM stage. Comparing cancer patients to controls, the AUROC was 0.90 (P\u202f<\u202f.0001), 0.87 (P\u202f<\u202f.0001), 0.59 (P\u202f=\u202f.311) and 0.53 (P\u202f=\u202f.747) for C6Ma1, C6Ma3, PRO-C6 and IC-6, respectively. Only C6M and C6Ma3 correlated significantly (Spearman, r\u202f=\u202f0.74, P\u202f<\u202f.0001). CONCLUSIONS: MMP-generated COL6 fragments (C6Ma1, C6Ma3) were elevated in serum from cancer patients compared to controls and had promising diagnostic accuracy. This supports that MMP-mediated COL6 remodeling is important in tumorigenesis and indicate cancer biomarker potential of quantifying COL-6 fragments in serum. Future studies should determine biological and clinical applicability of the COL-6 serum biomarkers in relation to cancer.",

The purpose of this study is to compare the response evaluation of DWI for chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to recurrent tumors of lung cancer with that of CT which is a standard tool in RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours). Forty-one patients who agreed to this project and had CT scan and DWI examinations within a month of each other every six months for at least 2 years after pulmonary resection of primary lung cancer were enrolled in this study. Of the patients, 24 patients had metastases or recurrences, and CT and DWI were performed for assessment of the response evaluation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to recurrent lesions. They were followed up for at least two years after the relapse. The response evaluation by CT using RECIST were PR in five patients, SD in two, and PD in the remaining 17 patients. On the other hand, the response evaluation by DWI were CR in four patients, PR in two patients, SD in one, and PD in the remaining 17 patients. Follow-up studies revealed the response evaluation by DWI were correct. Functional evaluation of DWI is better than that of CT for the response evaluation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to recurrent tumors of lung cancer.",

     "abstract": "The third-generation EGFR inhibitor, osimertinib (AZD9291), selectively and irreversibly inhibits EGFR activating and T790 M mutants while sparing wild-type EGFR. Osimertinib is now an approved drug for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with activating EGFR mutations (first-line) or those who have become resistant to 1st generation EGFR inhibitors through the T790 M mutation (second-line). Unfortunately, all patients eventually relapse and develop resistance to osimertinib. Hence, it is essential to fully understand the biology underlying the development of resistance to osimertinib in order to improve its therapeutic efficacy and overcome resistance. Cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) is a truncated form of caspase-8 and functions as a key inhibitor of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. The current study has demonstrated that osimertinib reduces c-FLIP levels via facilitating its degradation and enhances apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) primarily in NSCLC with activating EGFR mutations. Moreover, modulation of c-FLIP expression levels, to some degree, also alters the sensitivities of EGFR mutant NSCLC cells to undergo osimertinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that c-FLIP suppression is an important event contributing to the antitumor activity of osimertinib against EGFR mutant NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "Survival of epithelial ovarian cancer patients remains poor without significant change over many decades. There is a need to better identify women at high risk (HR) for ovarian cancer. We propose that miRNA dysregulation may play critical roles in the early stages of ovarian cancer development. Circulating miRNAs may represent an important biomarker in this context, and miRNA profiling of serum in women at HR compared to those at low risk (LR) may give insights in tumor initiation pathways. There is also rationale for a specific focus on regulation of the androgen and its related hypoxia pathways in tumor initiation. We hypothesized that subsets of these pathway related miRNAs may be downregulated in the HR state. Serum from four HR and five LR women were sequenced and analyzed for 2083 miRNAs. We found 137 miRNAs dysregulated between the HR and LR groups, of which 36 miRNAs were overexpressed in HR and the vast majority (101 miRNAs or 74%) downregulated in the HR, when compared to LR serum. mRNA targets for the differentially expressed miRNAs were analyzed from three different miRNA-mRNA interaction resources. Functional association analysis of hypoxia and androgen pathway mRNA targets of dysregulated miRNAs in HR serum revealed that all but one of the miRNAs that target 52 hypoxia genes were downregulated in HR compared to LR serum. Androgen pathway analysis also had a similar expression pattern where all but one of the miRNAs that target these 135 identified genes were downregulated in HR serum. Overall, there were 91 differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairings in the hypoxia analysis. In the androgen-related analysis, overall, there were 429 differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA pairs. Our pilot study suggests that almost all miRNAs that are conserved and/or validated are downregulated in the HR compared to LR serum. This study, which requires validation, suggests that, via miRNA dysregulation, involvement of both hypoxia and its related androgen pathways may contribute to the HR state. This pilot study is the first report to our knowledge that studies circulating miRNA profiling of HR and LR women.",

     "abstract": "IKZF1 deletion (\u0394IKZF1) is an important predictor of relapse in both childhood and adult B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Previously, we revealed that COBL is a hotspot for breakpoints in leukemia and could promote IKZF1 deletions. Through an international collaboration, we provide a detailed genetic and clinical picture of B-ALL with COBL rearrangements (COBL-r). Patients with B-ALL and IKZF1 deletion (n\u202f=\u202f133) were included. IKZF1 \u22061-8 were associated with large alterations within chromosome 7: monosomy 7 (18%), isochromosome 7q (10%), 7p loss (19%), and interstitial deletions (53%). The latter included COBL-r, which were found in 12% of the IKZF1 \u22061-8 cohort. Patients with COBL-r are mostly classified as intermediate cytogenetic risk and frequently harbor ETV6, PAX5, CDKN2A/B deletions. Overall, 56% of breakpoints were located within COBL intron 5. Cryptic recombination signal sequence motifs were broadly distributed within the sequence of COBL, and no enrichment for the breakpoint cluster region was found. In summary, a diverse spectrum of alterations characterizes \u0394IKZF1 and they also include deletion breakpoints within COBL. We confirmed that COBL is a hotspot associated with \u0394IKZF1, but these rearrangements are not driven by RAG-mediated recombination.",

In the present study, we aim to investigate the prognostic significance of these biomarkers in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients treated with trastuzumab (T). METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from 197 patients with HER2-positive MBC treated with T were retrospectively collected. All tissue samples were centrally assessed for ER, PgR, Ki67, HER2, and PTEN protein expression; EGFR gene amplification; PI3KCA mutational status; and tumor-infiltrating lympocytes density. Src, CDKN1B, and JAK2 mRNA expression was evaluated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Only 133 of the 197 patients (67.5%) were found to be HER2-positive by central assessment. CDKN1B mRNA expression was strongly correlated with Src (rho\u202f=\u202f0.71) and JAK2 (rho\u202f=\u202f0.54). In HER2-positive patients, low CDKN1B conferred higher risk for progression [hazard ratio (HR)\u202f=\u202f1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-2.32, P\u202f=\u202f.018].

Upon multivariate analyses, only low CDKN1B and JAK2 mRNA expression remained unfavorable factors for PFS in de novo and relapsed (R)-MBC patients, respectively (HR\u202f=\u202f2.36, 95% CI 1.01-5.48, P\u202f=\u202f.046 and HR\u202f=\u202f1.76, 95% CI 1.01-3.06, P\u202f=\u202f.047, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Low CDKN1B and JAK2 mRNA expressions were unfavorable prognosticators in a cohort of T-treated MBC patients.

A total of 52 cases of supratentorial gliomas in adults who received ASL imaging were enrolled in this retrospective study. The cerebral blood flow (CBF) images derived from ASL and anatomical maps were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute coordinate system and matched. The mean CBF (meanCBF), the maximum CBF (maxCBF), and their relative values (rmeanCBF and rmaxCBF, respectively) were assessed in each case. The tumor grades, IDH1 genotypes, and 1p/19q status were diagnosed according to the 2016 WHO criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curves were performed to assess the efficacy of perfusion parameters for grading. Qualitatively, all gliomas were divided into high- and low-perfusion groups. The crosstabs chi-square test of independence was performed to calculate contingency coefficient (C) and Cramer V coefficient to assess the correlation between perfusion and IDH1 genotypes and 1p/19q status of gliomas. The rmaxCBF showed the best diagnostic efficacy; meanwhile, rmeanCBF had the best specificity for grade discrimination. In astrocytoma, there was a mild correlation between IDH1 genotypes and tumor perfusion with the Cramer's V coefficient of 0.378.

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Accumulation of PIK3CA, ESR1, and GATA3 mutations results in resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients; however, the response of these genes to chemotherapy is unclear. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the genetic response of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to chemotherapy in metastatic breast cancer patients. METHODS: The mutation frequency of 1021 genes was examined prior to chemotherapy in ctDNA of 44 estrogen receptor\u2013positive metastatic breast cancer patients. These genes were evaluated again in a subset of patients (n=24) following chemotherapy. Mutation frequency was defined as the percentage of mutations found in ctDNA compared to total cell-free DNA. RESULTS: Prior to chemotherapy, PIK3CA was the most commonly mutated gene, with mutation found in 22 of the metastatic breast cancer patients. Following chemotherapy, 16 patients exhibited progressive disease (PD), and 8 patients experienced no progression (non-PD). PIK3CA mutation frequency increased in 56.25% (9/16) of the PD patients but decreased in 62.5% (5/8) of the non-PD patients. As a result, more PD patients exhibited increased PIK3CA mutation frequency than non-PD patients (56.25% vs 0%, P=.002). Further, ESR1 and GATA3 mutations correlated with PIK3CA mutation. Interestingly, patients receiving the mTOR inhibitor everolimus exhibited a lower progression rate (0% vs 62.5%, P=.001), and the combination of everolimus and chemotherapy effectively suppressed PIK3CA, ESR1, and GATA3 gene mutations. CONCLUSION: Together, these results suggest that mTOR inhibition may be a useful chemotherapy adjuvant to suppress chemotherapy-induced gene mutations that render tumors resistant to endocrine therapy in metastatic breast cancer patients with PD.",

Here, we investigated EBV infection-induced Nrf2 activation in B cells by analyzing translocation of Nrf2 from the cytosol to the nucleus. In addition, we confirmed expression of the target genes in response to increased Nrf2 activation in EBV-transformed B cells. We demonstrated that knockdown of LMP1 and 2A blocks the translocation of Nrf2 to the nucleus and reduces ROS production in EBV-transformed B cells. Further, we showed that inhibition of Akt prevents Nrf2 activation. Moreover, knockdown of Nrf2 induces apoptotic cell death in EBV-transformed B cells. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that Nrf2 promotes proliferation of EBV-transformed B cells through the EBV-related proteins LMP1 and 2A and Akt signaling, implicating Nrf2 as a potential molecular target for EBV-associated disease.",

     "abstract": "Cisplatin is a common anticancer drug, but it comes with significant nephrotoxicity. Further cisplatin-induced oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of the nephrotoxicity. A new compound, BiZn, can potentially prevent this complication. We verified our postulation by in vitro and in vivo models. From our findings, BiZn did not affect cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity on neuroblastoma cells under both in vitro and in vivo settings. However, BiZn significantly reduced the blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels in cisplatin-treated mice. Under the lethal dosage of cisplatin, co-treatment of BiZn significantly increased the survival rate. BiZn stimulated antioxidant proteins metallothionein (MT) and glutathione (GSH) generation from kidney cells and minimized cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Knocking down MT-IIA and inhibiting GSH abolished such protection. In conclusion, pretreatment of BiZn decreased cisplatin-induced renal toxicity without affecting its antitumor activity. BiZn-induced antioxidant proteins MT and GSH may contribute to the renal protection effect.",

We conducted a phase I trial to evaluate dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for the combination therapy. The following dose levels were tested in this single-arm phase I study: docetaxel as an intravenous infusion over 1\u202fhour at 60\u202fmg/m2 once every 3\u202fweeks of a 21-day schedule plus savolitinib (level 1, 200\u202fmg qd; level 2, 400\u202fmg qd; level 3, 600\u202fmg qd; level 4800\u202fmg qd).

     "abstract": "Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease and often relapses after standard chemotherapy. Recently, the neddylation (NEDD8) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways have emerged as promising pharmaceutical targets for AML therapy. However, the interaction of these two pathways remains unclear. Here we evaluated the effects of pevonedistat, an inhibitor of the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE), and sapanisertib (TAK-228), an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as single agents or in combination on AML cell lines. We found that inhibition of neddylation with pevonedistat partially inhibited mTOR signaling transduction and vice versa, inhibition of mTOR signaling with sapanisertib partially inhibited neddylation in AML cell lines. Pevonedistat alone was able to induce cytotoxicity in most AML cell lines as well as in primary AML, whereas sapanisertib alone decreased cell metabolic activity, reduced cell size and arrested cells in G0 phase with only minimal induction of cell death. In addition, pevonedistat was able to induce cell differentiation, arrest cells in G2/M cell cycle phases, and induce DNA re-replication and damage. However, co-treatment with sapanisertib suppressed pevonedistat induced apoptosis, differentiation, S/G2/M arrest, and DNA damage. Taken together, our data demonstrate that pevonedistat and sapanisertib exhibit distinct anti-tumor effects on AML cells, i.e. cytotoxic and cytostatic effects, respectively; however, sapanisertib can attenuate pevonedistat-induced cellular responses in AML cells. Understanding mTOR and neddylation pathway interaction could provide therapeutic strategies for treatment of AML and other malignancies.",

     "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are key components of the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM). A molecular signature in hMSCs from Acute myeloid leukemia patients (hMSC-AML) has been proposed where BMP4 is decreased and could be regulated by WNT signaling pathway. Therefore, the aim of this work was to verify whether the WNT signaling pathway can regulate the BMP4 gene in hMSCs. The results showed differentially expressed genes in the WNT canonical pathway between hMSC-AML and hMSCs from healthy donors and a real-time quantitative assay corroborated with these findings. Moreover, the main WNT canonical pathway regulators were decreased in hMSC-AML, such as LEF-1, \u03b2-catenin and the \u03b2-catenin/TCF-LEF regulatory complex in the nucleus. This result, together with functional assays, suggests that the induction of BMP4 expression by the WNT signaling pathway is decreased in hMSC-AML. Overall, the WNT canonical pathway is able to regulate the BMP4 gene in hMSC-AML and its reduced activation could also lead to the lower expression of BMP4 in hMSC-AML. Due to the important role of the BMM, changes in BMP4 expression through the WNT canonical pathway may be a potential mechanism of leukemogenesis.",

     "abstract": "RRx-001 is a pleiotropic anticancer agent in phase III clinical trials, which polarizes tumor-associated macrophages from a low phagocytic M2 phenotype to a high phagocytic M1 phenotype. One of the ways in which tumors promote M2 polarization and evade macrophage-mediated destruction is through upregulation of CD47 expression. As a myeloid-specific immune checkpoint, CD47 interacts with signal-regulatory protein alpha (SIRP\u03b1) on macrophages and monocytes to prevent phagocytosis. Herein, the effect of RRx-001 on CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 expression was evaluated as well as its activity in vivo in macrophage-depleted tumors. In vitro, RRx-001 was found to decrease the expression levels of CD47 and SIRP\u03b1 on tumor cells and monocytes/macrophages, respectively, reducing the phagocytosis inhibitory function of the CD47/SIRP\u03b1 interaction. In vivo, macrophage depletion by clodronate in an A549 xenograft-bearing mouse model attenuated the ability of RRx-001 to suppress tumor growth, which suggests that the presence of infiltrated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment is a sine qua non condition for the antitumor activity of RRx-001. Furthermore, these in vitro effects translate into significant antitumor activity in mouse models of lung cancer. Importantly, unlike anti-CD47 antibodies, RRx-001, which has been evaluated in close to 300 patients in 9 clinical trials, is not associated with any hematologic toxicities. On the basis of demonstrated antitumor activity and minimal toxicity in phase II clinical trials, RRx-001 has received clearance from the FDA and the EMA for phase III, multicenter studies in subjects with relapsed/refractory solid tumors.",

We randomly assigned 278 patients with stage III or IV NPC (without distant metastases) to receive either TPF or PF induction chemotherapy, followed by cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy every 3 weeks and intensity-modulated radiation therapy for 5 days per week.

However, LCNEC patients often received the chemotherapy regimens similar to non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in advanced stage and the therapeutic effect was unsatisfactory. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the hidden clinical features, prognosis and immunoprofile of the LCNEC, compared with carcinoid and SCLC, to explore whether LCNEC shares similarity with SCLC and potential treatment approaches could be revealed. METHODS: One hundred seventeen pulmonary NETs cases were retrospectively retrieved in this study. The Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator was employed to draw survival curves. Immunohistochemistry was applied to detect NET-related markers expression. RESULTS: In clinical features, compared with carcinoid, LCNEC patients were older, more commonly in male and advanced stage. The parallel phenomena were also found in the high-grade subgroup when compared with the low- to intermediate-grade one. In survival analysis, the 5-year overall survival of LCNECs was 59.1%, which was poorer than that of carcinoids, but better than that of SCLCs. Immunohistochemistry showed that p53 and PTEN functional inactivation, up-regulation of CD117 expression, down-regulation of SSR2A and SSR5 expression were commonly involved in LCNECs when compared with carcinoids, or in the high-grade subgroup when compared with the low- to intermediate-grade one. However, no significant difference was found in the comparison between LCNECs and SCLCs, or NSCLCs and SCLCs. CONCLUSION: In clinical features, survival and immunoprofile, LCNEC showed more similarity with SCLC rather than carcinoid, which might guide novel therapy for pulmonary NETs.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Gender-specific differences have led to the androgen receptor (AR) being considered a possible factor in the pathophysiology of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB), but the exact role remains unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The association of AR mRNA expression with clinicopathological features was retrospectively analyzed in two previously described cohorts. The first cohort consisted of 41 patients with all stages of UCB treated at Aarhus University Hospital, Denmark. The second cohort consisted of 323 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) accumulated by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network. RESULTS: AR mRNA expression is significantly higher in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) when compared to MIBC (P\u202f=\u202f.0004), with no relevant changes within the different stages of MIBC. AR mRNA expression was significantly associated with TCGA molecular subtypes (P\u202f<\u202f.0001). In the total cohort, there was no association between AR expression and gender (P\u202f=\u202f.23). When analyzed separately, females showed a significantly worse disease-free (P\u202f=\u202f.03) and overall survival (P\u202f=\u202f.02) when expressing AR mRNA above median level, while the same was not observed for men. Multivariable Cox's regression analyses revealed AR mRNA expression to be an independent prognostic marker for disease-free survival in women (P\u202f=\u202f.007). CONCLUSIONS: AR mRNA expression is significantly higher in NMIBC than in MIBC, while high AR mRNA expression is associated with worse survival in females with MIBC. Further studies need to investigate the gender-specific role of AR in UCB.",

The antidiabetic drug metformin is also a potent AMPK activator and we investigated whether it augmented panobinostat's antineoplastic activity in bladder cancer cells (UMUC3, J82, T24 and MBT-2). Metformin enhanced panobinostat-induced apoptosis and the combination inhibited the growth of bladder cancer cells cooperatively in vitro and in vivo. As expected, metformin increased the phosphorylation of AMPK and decreased the panobinostat-caused phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein, thus inhibiting the panobinostat-activated mTOR pathway. The AMPK activation was shown to play a pivotal role in the combination's action because the AMPK inhibitor compound C attenuated the combination's anticancer activity. Furthermore, the AMPK activation by metformin enhanced panobinostat-induced histone and non-histone acetylation. This acetylation was especially remarkable in the proteins in the detergent-insoluble fraction, which would be expected if the combination also induced endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

Aurora Kinase A (AKA) is over-expressed in pancreatic cancer (PC) and controls G2-M transition during mitosis and AKA inhibitors have been developed that induce mitotic arrest.

In addition, combination therapy was more effective than single drug in the suppression of tumor growth in AsPC-1 xenograft mouse models.

We looked for correlations between pre- or post- vaccination biomarkers and clinical outcomes to DC therapy in a cohort of patients with stage IV melanoma receiving a vaccine with autologous ex-vivo expanded DCs pulsed with allogeneic tumor cell lysate. METHODS: Serial serum samples were collected at baseline, week 4 and 12 and they were analyzed for a panel of different inflammatory markers using cytometric bead array technology and ELISA. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients were evaluable for response. Patients were separated into responders and non-responders based on clinical benefit. Responders were defined as patients who achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease the latter lasting for at least 6 months. Responders (N = 9) showed a significantly longer Progression-free Survival (PFS; HR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08\u2013062; P < .001) and Overall Survival (OS; HR 0.22; 95% CI 0.08\u20130.59; P < .001). The clinical non-responder phenotype correlated with an elevated pre-vaccination level of cytokines associated with inflammation compared to clinical responders (Apolipoprotein C111; IL-12 p40; MiP1\u03b1; Stem Cell Factor and TNF\u03b1). Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) was also significantly elevated in the pre-vaccine sera of the clinically non-responding group and in addition it was found to correlate with outcomes.

Physiologic tumor models of drug resistance are crucial to understand mechanisms of treatment failure and improve therapy by developing new therapeutics and treatment strategies. Using our aqueous two-phase system microtechnology, we developed colorectal tumor spheroids and periodically treated them with sub-lethal concentrations of three Mitogen Activated Kinase inhibitors (MEKi) used in clinical trials. We used long-term, periodic treatment and recovery of spheroids to mimic cycles of clinical chemotherapy and implemented a growth rate metric to quantitatively assess efficacy of the MEKi during treatment. Our results showed that efficacy of the MEKi significantly reduced with increased treatment cycles. Using a comprehensive molecular analysis, we established that resistance of colorectal tumor spheroids to the MEKi developed through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. We also showed that other potential feedback mechanisms, such as STAT3 activation or amplified B-RAF, did not account for resistance to the MEKi. We combined each of the three MEKi with a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and showed that the combination treatments synergistically blocked resistance to the MEKi. Importantly, and unlike the individual inhibitors, we demonstrated that synergistic concentrations of combinations of MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors effectively inhibited growth of colorectal tumor spheroids in long-term treatments.

However, p53 is inhibited by viral oncoprotein E6, leading to premature proteasomal degradation. We asked whether bortezomib (BZM), a clinically approved inhibitor of the proteasome, can functionally restore p53 and investigated in how far this will result in an enhanced radio- or chemosensitivity of HPV+ HNSCC cell lines. For all four HPV+ cell lines tested, BZM led to functional restoration of p53 and transactivation of downstream protein p21. In HPV+ cells, BZM also restored the radiation-induced p53/p21 transactivation.

     "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) blockade resistance is common in the treatment of RAS wide type colorectal cancer (CRC). During the treatment of cetuximab, acquired resistant genomic alterations always occurs earlier than disease progression observed by medical images. Identification of genomic alterations dynamically might have certain clinical significance. Because of the limitation of repeated tissue biopsy, liquid biopsy is increasingly recognized. Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) is the main detection methods for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), however, the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for ctDNA detection becomes more and more popular. Here we develop a NGS-based ctDNA assay and evaluated its sensitivity and specificity while using ddPCR as control. These two technologies were both used for genomic alteration detection for the peripheral blood samples from cetuximab-treated colorectal cancer patients dynamically. Fifteen patients were enrolled in this study, including eight males and seven females. The sensitivity and specificity of our NGS assay were 87.5% and 100% respectively, and liner regression analysis comparing variant allele frequency (VAF) revealed high concordance between NGS and ddPCR (R2\u202f=\u202f0.98). NGS actually found more mutation information than ddPCR such as the additional dynamic changes of TP53 which were observed in the disease progression patients. Moreover, the variant allele fraction of TP53 was also found by NGS to be changed along with the clinical efficacy evaluation dynamically during the whole treatment process. In conclusion, our newly developed NGS-based ctDNA assay shows similar performance with ddPCR but have more advantages of its high throughput of multigenetic detection for the dynamic monitoring during the treatment of cetuximab in metastasis CRC patients.",

     "abstract": "Non-small cell lung carcinoma patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are offered EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) as first line treatment, but 20\u201340% of these patients do not respond. High expression of alternative receptor tyrosine kinases, such as Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1), potentially mediates intrinsic EGFR TKI resistance. To study this in molecular detail, we used CRISPR-dCas9 Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM) for up-regulation of FGFR1 in physiological relevant levels in the EGFR mutated NSCLC cell lines HCC827 and PC9 thereby generating HCC827gFGFR1 and PC9gFGFR1. The sensitivity to the TKI erlotinib was investigated in vitro and in a BALBc nu/nu mouse xenograft model. FGFR1 up-regulation decreased TKI-sensitivity in both NSCLC cell lines in the presence of the ligand fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). Xenografts were established with PC9gFGFR1 cells and it was demonstrated that there was no significant difference in tumor size between TKI- and vehicle-treated PC9gFGFR1 tumors. This supports decreased TKI-sensitivity in NSCLC cells with FGFR1 up-regulation. Our study points to FGFR1 signaling being an intrinsic resistance mechanism abolishing TKI response in EGFR mutated NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "Heterogeneous response to chemotherapy is a major issue for the treatment of cancer. For most gynecologic cancers including ovarian, cervical, and placental, the list of available small molecule therapies is relatively small compared to options for other cancers. While overall cancer mortality rates have decreased in the United States as early diagnoses and cancer therapies have become more effective, ovarian cancer still has low survival rates due to the lack of effective treatment options, drug resistance, and late diagnosis. To understand chemotherapeutic diversity in gynecologic cancers, we have screened 7914 approved drugs and bioactive compounds in 11 gynecologic cancer cell lines to profile their chemotherapeutic sensitivity. We identified two HDAC inhibitors, mocetinostat and entinostat, as pan-gynecologic cancer suppressors with IC50 values within an order of magnitude of their human plasma concentrations. In addition, many active compounds identified, including the non-anticancer drugs and other compounds, diversely inhibited the growth of three gynecologic cancer cell groups and individual cancer cell lines. These newly identified compounds are valuable for further studies of new therapeutics development, synergistic drug combinations, and new target identification for gynecologic cancers. The results also provide a rationale for the personalized chemotherapeutic testing of anticancer drugs in treatment of gynecologic cancer.",

     "abstract": "The interleukin-24 (IL-24), a member of the IL-10\u2013related cytokine gene family, is well known for its tumor suppressor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumors without damaging normal cells. However, poor tumor penetration remains a key problem for the efficacy of IL-24 as a treatment. iRGD is a novel tumor-specific peptide with unique tumor-penetrating and cell-internalizing properties. To enhance the tumor-penetrating and antitumor effects of IL-24, we engineered a recombinant protein consisting of the IL-24 fused to iRGD, which was named IL-24-iRGD. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antitumor effects of IL-24-iRGD in prostate cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. It was observed that IL-24-iRGD induced cell apoptosis, suppressed cell growth of PC-3 in vitro, and promoted protein penetration into tumors in vivo, whereas it had no effect on normal cell line RWPE-1. Then, PC-3 cells were subcutaneously injected into nude mice, and these tumor-bearing mice were administered with IL-24, IL-24-iRGD, or PBS via the tail vein. The IL-24\u2013 and IL-24-iRGD\u2013treated groups exhibited tumor growth inhibition rates of 38.6% and 65.6%, respectively, when compared with the PBS-treated group. Besides, cell apoptosis was examined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling, and the expression of cleaved caspase-3 was analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrated that IL-24-iRGD induced apoptosis and inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells to a significantly greater extent when compared with IL-24 treatment alone. It may provide an improved strategy for antitumor therapy and the clinical treatment of prostate cancer.",

Using proteomics approaches, we have identified peroxiredoxin-4 (PRDX4) as a cancer-secreted mediator of osteoclastogenesis. We now report characterization of L-plastin in the conditioned media (CM) of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells using immunoblotting and mass spectrometry. The osteoclastogenic potential of MDA-MB-231 CM with siRNA-silenced L-plastin was significantly reduced. L-plastin was detected in cancer-derived exosomes, and inhibition of exosomal release significantly decreased the osteoclastogenic capacity of MDA-MB-231 CM. When added to osteoclast precursors primed with RANKL for 2 days, recombinant L-plastin induced calcium/NFATc1-mediated osteoclastogenesis to the levels similar to continuous treatment with RANKL. Using shRNA, we generated MDA-MB-231 cells lacking L-plastin, PRDX4, or both and injected these cell populations intratibially in CD-1 immunodeficient mice. Micro-CT and histomorphometric analysis demonstrated a complete loss of osteolysis when MDA-MB-231 cells lacking both L-plastin and PRDX4 were injected. A meta-analysis established an increase in L-plastin and PRDX4 mRNA expression in numerous human cancers, including breast and prostate carcinomas.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to detect IDO1 expression in bladder cancer tissues and then to investigate the role of IDO1 in bladder cancer cell EMT and malignant phenotypes as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. By immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction experiments, IDO1 was found to be overexpressed in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared to the noncancerous ones. In addition, knockdown of IDO1 expression was shown to inhibit bladder cancer cell growth, migration, invasion, and EMT. Furthermore, we demonstrated that IDO1 may promote EMT by activation of the interleukin 6/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3/programmed cell death ligand 1 signaling pathway.

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite the availability of current standards of care treatments for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), many patients still die from this disease. Quadruple negative tumors, which are TNBC tumors that lack androgen receptor (AR), represent a more aggressive subtype of TNBC; however, the molecular features are not well understood. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), HER2, and AR was determined in 244 primary and 630 recurrent/metastatic site biopsies. Expression was correlated with a panel of 25 cancer-related genes and proteins by IHC and in situ hybridization (ISH). RESULTS: We observed that 80.2% (65 of 81) of primary TNBC tumors and 75.7% (159 of 210) of recurrent/metastatic TNBC tumors are QNBC. Bivariate fit analysis demonstrated that QNBC (n\u202f=\u202f224) significantly (P\u202f<\u202f.03) correlated with younger aged patients at initial biopsy compared to AR positive TNBC patients (n\u202f=\u202f51). In paired primary tissue samples and primary to recurrent/metastatic samples, at least 70% Luminal, HER2 enriched, and QNBC subtype did not change molecular profile. But, TNBC seems to be the \u201cunstable\u201d subtype. Within the total cohort, discordance in molecular profiles was identified in both synchronous (20%) and asynchronous (21%) intra-individual analyses. Irrespective of sample type, (Synchronous or Asynchronous), QNBC demonstrated higher concordant than TNBC. IHC and ISH results of the cancer related genes, demonstrated that gene/protein expression differ by molecular profile: TNBC (HR-/HER2-, AR+) and QNBC (HR-/HER2-, AR-). IHC in metastatic tumors, showed that the percentage of tumors positive of EGFR were higher, while PTEN and TLE3 were lower in QNBC compared to TNBC. CONCLUSION: Standard treatment of Breast Cancer (BC) relies on reliable assessment by IHC analysis of ER, PR, and HER2. Our analyses suggest that the heterogeneity of TNBC is at least partially associated with the presence or absence of AR expression, suggesting that QNBC should be considered as a clinically relevant BC subtype. IHC analysis of AR appears to be a practical assay to determine the most aggressive TNBC subtypes and identifies tumors that could benefit from available targeted therapies.",

METHODS: Forty-one patients with mCRC with disease progression after treatment with fluoropyrimidines, oxaliplatin, irinotecan, anti-VEGF, and anti-EGFR MoAbs were subjected to UGT1A1 genotyping and received regorafenib combined with FOLFIRI with dose-escalated irinotecan. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 10.0\u202fmonths (1.3-23.5\u202fmonths). The overall disease control rate was 58.5%, whereas the median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were 6.0\u202fmonths and 12.0\u202fmonths, respectively. KRAS mutations were significantly associated with positive EGFR expression (P\u202f=\u202f.026). KRAS mutations significantly correlated with a shorter OS than KRAS wild-type (6.0 vs. 14.4\u202fmonths, P\u202f=\u202f.014) but had no significant association with PFS. Positive EGFR expression had an inverse correlation with PFS (2.5 vs. 14.0\u202fmonths, P\u202f=\u202f.039) and OS (9.6 vs. 19.7\u202fmonths, P\u202f=\u202f.044). Moreover, left-sided tumors associated with superior PFS (2.0 vs. 7.0\u202fmonths, P\u202f<\u202f.0001) and OS (4.0 vs. 13.0\u202fmonths, P\u202f<\u202f.0001), and tumor sidedness was an independent prognostic factor by the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Regorafenib and FOLFIRI concomitant therapy with dose-escalated irinotecan seemed to be potentially practicable with satisfactory oncological results. KRAS mutations and EGFR expression might be predictors of poor oncological outcomes; however, left-sided mCRCs would be more beneficial for concomitant regorafenib and FOLFIRI therapy.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive form of primary malignant brain tumor in adults, with poor prognosis. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key-mediators for cellular communication through transfer of proteins and genetic material. Cancers, such as GBM, use EV release for drug-efflux, pro-oncogenic signaling, invasion and immunosuppression; thus the modulation of EV release and cargo is of considerable clinical relevance. As EV-inhibitors have been shown to increase sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy, and we recently showed that cannabidiol (CBD) is such an EV-modulator, we investigated whether CBD affects EV profile in GBM cells in the presence and absence of temozolomide (TMZ). Compared to controls, CBD-treated cells released EVs containing lower levels of pro-oncogenic miR21 and increased levels of anti-oncogenic miR126; these effects were greater than with TMZ alone. In addition, prohibitin (PHB), a multifunctional protein with mitochondrial protective properties and chemoresistant functions, was reduced in GBM cells following 1 h CBD treatment. This data suggests that CBD may, via modulation of EVs and PHB, act as an adjunct to enhance treatment efficacy in GBM, supporting evidence for efficacy of cannabinoids in GBM.",

     "abstract": "Since a fecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer (CRC) does not offer sufficient diagnostic power for CRC, novel non-invasive biomarkers are hopeful for CRC screening. We conducted the current study to discover non-invasive urinary biomarkers for diagnosing CRC. Among urine samples from 258 patients (CRC, n\u202f=\u202f148; healthy controls, n\u202f=\u202f110), a cohort of 176 patients composed of 88 patients with GC and 88 healthy controls was selected after age- and sex-matching using propensity score. This cohort was then randomly divided into 2 groups: 53 pairs (106 patients) in the training cohort, and 35 pairs (70 patients) in the validation cohort. No significant differences were found for baseline characteristics between the CRC and healthy control groups in both training and validation cohorts. On multivariate analysis in the training cohort, urinary levels of cysteine-rich protein 61 (uCyr61) and trefoil factor 3 (uTFF3) were identified as independent significant diagnostic markers for CRC. Moreover, uCyr61 alone and the combination of uCyr61 and uTFF3 allowed significant differentiation between healthy controls and CRC groups in the training set (uCyr61: area under the curve (AUC)\u202f=\u202f0.745 [95% CI, 0.653\u20130.838]; uCyr61\u202f+\u202fuTFF3: AUC\u202f=\u202f0.753 [95% CI, 0.659\u20130.847]). In the validation cohort, uCyr61 and uTFF3 were significantly higher in the CRC group than in the healthy control group, and they also allowed significant differentiation between healthy control and CRC groups (uCyr61: AUC\u202f=\u202f0.696 [95% CI, 0.571\u20130.822]; uTFF3: AUC\u202f=\u202f0.639 [95% CI, 0.508\u20130.770]; uCyr61\u202f+\u202fuTFF3: AUC\u202f=\u202f0.720 [95% CI, 0.599\u20130.841]), as in the training cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we have compared by means of RNAscope technology STAT3 RNA expression in human DLBCL in a selected group of activated B-cell\u2013like DLBCL (ABC-DLBCL) patients with another group of germinal center B-cell\u2013like DLBCL (GBC-DLBCL) patients. RESULTS: The results have shown that ABC DLBCL tissue samples contained a significantly higher number of STAT3-positive cells as compared with GCB tissue samples. Moreover, by means of confocal immunofluorescence analysis, we have observed that tumor vessels in ABC samples appeared lined by endothelial cells expressing both FVIII and STAT3 signals, while in GCB samples, only few vessels coexpressed FVIII and STAT3. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm other reports showing that STAT3 is highly expressed and activated in ABC-DLBCL and our previously published data demonstrating that, in primary central nervous system lymphoma, tumor vessels appeared lined by endothelial cells expressing both FVIII and STAT3.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Prognostic schemes that rely on clinical variables to predict outcome after resection of colorectal metastases remain imperfect. We hypothesized that molecular markers can improve the accuracy of prognostic schemes. METHODS: We screened the transcriptome of matched colorectal liver metastases (CRCLM) and primary tumors from 42 patients with unresected CRCLM to identify differentially expressed genes. Among the differentially expressed genes identified, we looked for associations between expression and time to disease progression or overall survival. To validate such associations, mRNA levels of the candidate genes were assayed by qRT-PCR from CRCLM in 56 additional patients who underwent hepatectomy. RESULTS: Seven candidate genes were selected for validation based on their differential expression between metastases and primary tumors and a correlation between expression and surgical outcome: lumican; tissue inhibitor metalloproteinase 1; basic helix-loop-helix domain containing class B2; fibronectin; transmembrane 4 superfamily member 1; mitogen inducible gene 6 (MIG-6); and serpine 2. In the hepatectomy group, only MIG-6 expression was predictive of poor survival after hepatectomy. Quantitative PCR of MIG-6 mRNA was performed on 25 additional hepatectomy patients to determine if MIG-6 expression could substratify patients beyond the clinical risk score. Patients within defined clinical risk score categories were effectively substratified into distinct groups by relative MIG-6 expression. CONCLUSIONS: MIG-6 expression is inversely associated with survival after hepatectomy and may be used to improve traditional prognostic schemes that rely on clinicopathologic data such as the Clinical Risk Score.",

Dysregulation of claudin 1 has been shown to induce epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, activation of the ERK signaling pathway by protein kinase C (PKC) was shown to be necessary for EMT induction. Whether PKC is involved in regulating breast cancer progression has not been addressed. The PKC activator 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) was used to investigate the effect of PKC activity on claudin 1 transcription and protein levels, subcellular distribution, and alterations in EMT markers in human breast cancer (HBC) cell lines. As well, tissue microarray analysis (TMA) of a large cohort of invasive HBC biopsies was conducted to investigate correlations between claudin 1 and PKC isomers. TPA upregulated claudin 1 levels in all HBC cell lines analyzed. In particular, a high induction of claudin 1 protein was observed in the MCF7 cell line. TPA treatment also led to an accumulation of claudin 1 in the cytoplasm. Additionally, we demonstrated that the upregulation of claudin 1 was through the ERK signaling pathway. In patient biopsies, we identified a significant positive correlation between claudin 1, PKC\u03b1, and PKC\u03b5 in ER+ tumors. A similar correlation between claudin 1 and PKC\u03b5 was identified in ER\u2212 tumors, and high PKC\u03b5 was associated with shorter disease-free survival.

In RT-qPCR assays, the combination of miR-151-5p, miR-152-3p, and miR-423-3p was identified as the most stable normalization factor across clinical markers, HPV type, and hypoxia status. RNU6 showed poor stability.

     "abstract": "AIM: Transfer of exosomes (Exo) miRNA was described interfering with tumor progression. We here explored for claudin7 (cld7) and EpCAM (EpC), cancer-initiating-cell markers in colorectal and pancreatic cancer, the efficacy of Exo loading with miRNA and miRNA transfer. METHODS: Exo were collected from nontransformed mouse (NIH3T3) and rat lung fibroblasts (rFb), which were transfected with Tspan8 cDNA (NIH3T3-Tspan8, rFb-Tspan8). Exo were loaded by electroporation with miRNA. The transfer of Exo-miRNA was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in a rat pancreatic (ASML) and a human colon (SW948) cancer line. RESULTS: NIH3T3-Tspan8- or rFb-Tspan8-Exo were efficiently loaded with cld7- or EpC-miRNA. Exo targeting in vivo was strongly improved by tailoring with Tspan8. Exo-miRNA transfer into tumor targets promoted cld7, respectively, EpC downregulation by 33%-60%. Cld7 silencing was accompanied by reduced expression of additional cancer-initiating cell markers and NOTCH. EpC silencing reduced vimentin, N-cadherin, and Nanog expression. The Exo-miRNA transfer affected anchorage-independent growth, motility, and invasion. CONCLUSIONS: Exo are efficiently loaded with miRNA, miRNA-delivery being supported by Exo tailoring. Partial cld7 and EpC silencing by Exo miRNA affects metastasis-promoting tumor cell activities. The findings suggest miRNA loading of tailored Exo as an easy approachable and efficient adjuvant therapy.",

     "abstract": "Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary liver tumor in children, but treatment has not changed significantly in the past 20 years. We have previously demonstrated that Proviral Integration site for Moloney murine leukemia (PIM) kinases promote tumorigenesis in hepatoblastoma. Stem cell-like cancer cells (SCLCCs) are a subset of cells thought to be responsible for chemoresistance, metastasis, relapse, and recurrence. The aim of this study was to identify SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma and determine the role of PIM kinases in SCLCCs. Hepatoblastoma cells were separated into CD133-enriched and CD133-depleted populations and the frequency of SCLCCs was assessed. CD133 expression was determined in the presence or absence of the PIM inhibitor, AZD1208. The effects of AZD1208 on proliferation, apoptosis, and motility were assessed in vitro and the effect of AZD1208 on tumor growth was examined in vivo. We identified CD133 as a marker for SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma and showed that PIM kinases promote a SCLCC phenotype. PIM kinase inhibition with AZD1208 decreased proliferation, migration, and invasion and increased apoptosis in both SCLCCs and non-SCLCCs in a long-term passaged hepatoblastoma cell line and patient-derived xenograft. Additionally, tumor growth in mice implanted with hepatoblastoma SCLCCs was decreased with PIM inhibition such that 57% of the tumors regressed. These findings identify CD133 as a marker for SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma and provide evidence that inhibition of PIM kinases decreases stemness and tumorigenicity of SCLCCs in hepatoblastoma, making them potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of hepatoblastoma.",

In this study, we used a small molecule inhibitor of c-Met, crizotinib, in cetuximab-resistant, mutant KRAS-driven colorectal cancer cell lines and assessed radiosensitization. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray containing colorectal tumors was used to study the relationship between KRAS mutations and c-Met expression. For in vivo studies, we used the KRAS mutant cell lines HCT116, DLD1, and LoVo. Colony formation assays were performed to assess the effects of crizotinib and cetuximab. Immunoblot analysis was used to determine the effect of crizotinib on c-Met and downstream pathways and DNA damage response. We then selected noncytotoxic doses of crizotinib to assess clonogenic survival with radiation. To study potential mechanisms of radiosensitization, cell cycle analysis was performed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Analysis of the tissue microarray revealed that KRAS mutant tumors had active c-Met signaling. KRAS mutant cell lines LoVo, HCT116, and DLD1 were resistant to cetuximab but sensitive to crizotinib. Pretreatment with crizotinib for 24\u202fhours radiosensitized LoVo, DLD1, and HCT116 cell lines with enhancement ratios of 1.54, 1.23, and 1.30, respectively. Immunoblot analysis showed that crizotinib blocked radiation-induced c-Met phosphorylation and attenuated downstream signaling pathways. Cell cycle analysis revealed minimal G1 arrest with crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib completely blocked HGF induced cell migration. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of c-Met with crizotinib effectively sensitizes cetuximab-resistant KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines to radiation. Crizotinib has the potential to improve outcomes in locally advanced rectal cancer patients undergoing chemoradiation.",

     "abstract": "The involvement of chronic inflammation in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) progression is well established. Cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) is mutually expressed in various cancers and serves as a protective signal for phagocytic elimination. CD47 signaling blockage is a recent treatment strategy; however, little is known regarding CD47 in CCA. Therefore, the potential use of CD47 targeting in CCA was focused. CD47 was highly expressed in CCA compared to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Disturbance of CD47-signal regulatory protein-\u03b1 (SIRP\u03b1) interaction by blocking antibodies promoted the macrophage phagocytosis. The therapeutic potential of anti-CD47 therapy was demonstrated in liver metastatic model; alleviation of cancer colonization together with dense macrophage infiltrations was observed. The usefulness of anti-CD47 was emphasized by its universal facilitating macrophage activities. Moreover, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-10, in macrophage exposed to CCA-conditioned media suggested that CCA alters macrophages toward cancer promotion. Taken together, interfering of CD47-SIRP\u03b1 interaction promotes macrophage phagocytosis in all macrophage subtypes and consequently suppresses CCA growth and metastasis. The unique overexpression of CD47 in CCA but not HCC offers an exceptional opportunity for a targeted therapy. CD47 is therefore a novel target for CCA treatment.",

METHODS: Newly developed multi-spectral fluorescence endoscope device has the potential to eliminate signal interference due to autofluorescence and multiplex fluorophores in fluorescent probes. The multiplexing capability of the multi-spectral endoscope device was demonstrated in the phantom studies and multi-spectral imaging with endoscopy and macroscopy was performed to analyze fluorescence signals after administration of fluorescent probe that targets cancer in the colon. Because of the limitations in the clinical application using rigid-type small animal endoscope, we developed a flexible channel insert-type fluorescence endoscope, which was validated on the colonoscopy of dummy and porcine model. RESULTS: We measured multiple fluorescent signals simultaneously, and the fluorescence spectra were unmixed to separate the fluorescent signals of each probe, in which multiple fluorescent probes clearly revealed spectral deconvolution at the specific targeting area in the mouse colon. The positive area of fluorescence signal for each probe over the whole polyp was segmented with analyzing software, and showed distinctive patterns and significantly distinguishable values: 0.46\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.04, 0.39\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.08 and 0.73\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.12 for HMRG, CET-553 and TRA-675 probes, respectively.

     "publication date": "02-2019",
     "abstract": "IQGAP2 was recently reported as a tumor suppressor of prostate cancer (PC). Nonetheless, its clinical implications remain unknown. To address this issue, we extracted data related to IQGAP2 mRNA expression and genomic alterations from multiple large datasets within the Oncomine and cBioPortal databases and performed in silico analyses to determine a potential association of IQGAP2 mRNA expression and its genomic alterations with PC progression. In 4 cohorts consisting of 118 normal prostate tissues and 277 PCs, IQGAP2 mRNA expression was significantly elevated particularly in low-grade (primary Gleason score \u22643) PCs; these changes separate PC from normal tissues with area under curve values of 0.7-0.8. Significant reductions in IQGAP2 mRNA levels and gene copy number occurred in more than 70 metastases compared to at least 230 local PCs. This duo-alteration in IQGAP2 expression supports IQGAP2 elevation suppressing and its downregulation facilitating PC progression. Deletion and missense mutations were detected in 23 of 492 primary PCs; these alterations significantly associate with PC recurrence (HR=2.71; 95% CI: 1.35-5.44; P=.005) after adjusting for known risk factors and correlate with reductions in disease-free survival (DFS, P=.002). IQGAP2 (5q13.3) genomic alterations were observed in SPOP-marked PCs and co-occurred with deletion in the RN7SK (16p12.2), SNORA50A (16q21), and SNORA50C (17q23.3) genes; the co-occurrence associated with reductions in DFS (P=4.14e-4). In two independent PC populations, MSKCC (n=130) and TCGA provisional (n=490), reductions in IQGAP2 mRNA expression were significantly associated with DFS. Collectively, this investigation reveals an association of IQGAP2 with PC progression.",

Furthermore, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) secretion induced by IL-6 and OSM may also be subtype-dependent. Utilizing datasets from Oncomine, we show that poor survival of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) breast cancer patients is correlated with both high VEGF expression and high cytokine or cytokine receptor expression in tumors. Importantly, epidermal growth factor receptor-negative (HER2-), but not HER2-positive (HER2+), patient survival is significantly lower with high tumor co-expression of VEGF and OSM, OSMR\u03b2, IL-6, or IL-6R\u03b1 compared to low co-expression. Furthermore, assessment of HER2- breast cancer cells in vitro identified unique signaling differences regulating cytokine-induced VEGF secretion. The levels of VEGF secretion were analyzed by ELISA with siRNAs for hypoxia inducible factor 1 \u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Specifically, we found that estrogen receptor-negative (ER-) MDA-MB-231 cells respond only to OSM through STAT3 signaling, while ER+ T47D cells respond to both OSM and IL-6, though to IL-6 to a lesser extent. Additionally, in the ER+ T47D cells, OSM signals through both STAT3 and HIF1\u03b1. These results highlight that the survival of breast cancer patients with high co-expression of VEGF and IL-6 family cytokines is dependent on breast cancer subtype. Thus, the heterogeneity of human breast cancer in relation to IL-6 family cytokines and VEGF may have important implications in clinical treatment options, disease progression, and ultimately patient prognosis.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Steatohepatitis (SH) and SH-associated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are of considerable clinical significance. SH is morphologically characterized by steatosis, liver cell ballooning, cytoplasmic aggregates termed Mallory-Denk bodies (MDBs), inflammation, and fibrosis at late stage. Disturbance of the keratin cytoskeleton and aggregation of keratins (KRTs) are essential for MDB formation. METHODS: We analyzed livers of aged Krt18\u2212/\u2212 mice that spontaneously developed in the majority of cases SH-associated HCC independent of sex. Interestingly, the hepatic lipid profile in Krt18\u2212/\u2212 mice, which accumulate KRT8, closely resembles human SH lipid profiles and shows that the excess of KRT8 over KRT18 determines the likelihood to develop SH-associated HCC linked with enhanced lipogenesis. RESULTS: Our analysis of the genetic profile of Krt18\u2212/\u2212 mice with 26 human hepatoma cell lines and with data sets of >300 patients with HCC, where Krt18\u2212/\u2212 gene signatures matched human HCC. Interestingly, a high KRT8/18 ratio is associated with an aggressive HCC phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: We can prove that intermediate filaments and their binding partners are tightly linked to hepatic lipid metabolism and to hepatocarcinogenesis. We suggest KRT8/18 ratio as a novel HCC biomarker for HCC.",

     "abstract": "The patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model has been adopted as a major tool for studying tumorigenesis and differentiation in various carcinomas. In addition, it has been used in the development of anticancer agents. PDX models have been among the most meaningful tools used to understand the role of stromal cells and vascular cells in the body, which are major factors in cancer development and the application of therapeutic agents. Also, the establishment of PDX models from liposarcoma patients is considered to be important for understanding lipomagenesis and following drugs development. For these reasons, we developed patient-derived cell (PDC) and PDX models derived from 20 liposarcoma patients. The tissues of these patients were obtained in accordance with the principles of the Samsung Medical Center's ethics policy, and cell culture and xenografting onto the mice were performed under these principles. High-throughput drug screening (HTS) was carried out using established PDCs to select candidate drugs. Among the different candidate anticancer drugs, we tested the effect of bortezomib, which was expected to inhibit MDM2 amplification. First, we confirmed that the PDCs maintained the characteristics of liposarcoma cells by assessing MDM2 amplification and CDK4 overexpression using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Analysis of short tandem repeats and an array using comparative genomic hybridization confirmed that the PDX model exhibited the same genomic profile as that of the patient. Immunohistochemistry for MDM2 and CDK4 showed that the overexpression patterns of both proteins were similar in the PDX models and the PDCs. Specifically, MDM2 amplification was observed to be significantly correlated with the successful establishment of PDX mouse models. However, CDK4 expression did not show such a correlation. Of the anticancer drugs selected through HTS, bortezomib showed a strong anticancer effect against PDC. In addition, we observed that bortezomib suppressed MDM2 expression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, p21 tended to elicit an increase in PDC expression. Treatment of the PDX model with bortezomib resulted in an anticancer effect similar to that seen in the PDCs. These results support that PDCs and PDX models are among the most powerful tools for the development and clinical application of anticancer drugs for the treatment of liposarcoma patients.",

METHODS: One hundred ninety-two cases of renal tumors were collected and identified by pathologic diagnosis within 15\u202fdays after enhanced CT examination (66% male, 70% malignant renal tumors, average age of 62.27\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.26\u202fyears). The InceptionV3 model pretrained by the ImageNet dataset was cross-trained to perform this classification. Five image-level models were established for each of the Slice, region of interest (ROI), and rectangular box region (RBR) datasets. Then, two patient-level models were built based on the optimal image-level models. The network's performance was evaluated through analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and five-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: In the image-level models, the test results of model trained on the Slice dataset [accuracy (ACC)\u202f=\u202f0.69 and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)\u202f=\u202f0.45] were the worst.

We used a gene panel for capturing target regions covering 83 cancer-related genes. A total of 25 refractory metastatic solid tumor patients were enrolled in this study. Among the 25 patients, 7 had FDA-approved drug-responsive or -resistant alterations. However, the effectiveness of targeted therapy was assessed by follow-up in three patients (12%). These included crizotinib for ALK-EML4 fusion in a malignancy of undefined origin patient and everolimus for AKT3 amplification in a uterine sarcoma patient. In addition, we identified a KRAS codon 146 mutation (A146V), which is associated with resistance to anti-EGFR, in a cetuximab-resistant colon cancer patient with wild-type KRAS exons 2 and 12, and EGFR amplification. He received bevacizumab therapy. All three patients showed partial response after targeted therapy. Furthermore, we characterized KRAS A146V biologically using colon cancer cells.

The aim of this study was to identify phosphoproteins that are regulated upon irradiation. The comparative analysis of the phosphoproteome before and after irradiation brought nucleophosmin (NPM1) into focus as a versatile phosphoprotein that has already been associated with tumorigenesis. We could show that knockdown of NPM1 significantly reduces tumor cell survival after irradiation. NPM1 is dephosphorylated stepwise within 1 hour after irradiation at two of its major phosphorylation sites: threonine-199 and threonine-234/237. This dephosphorylation is not the result of a fast cell cycle arrest, and we found a heterogenous intracellular distribution of NPM1 between the nucleoli, the nucleoplasm, and the cytoplasm after irradiation. We hypothesize that the dephosphorylation of NPM1 at threonine-199 and threonine-234/237 is part of the immediate response to irradiation and of importance for tumor cell survival. These findings could make NPM1 an attractive pharmaceutical target to radiosensitize tumor cells and improve the outcome of radiotherapy by inhibiting the pathways that help tumor cells to escape cell death after gamma irradiation.",

We have recently revealed that FLT3-ITD confers resistance to the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitors by protecting the mTORC1/4EBP1/Mcl-1 pathway through Pim kinases induced by STAT5 activation in AML. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has recently been reported as a promising agent for treatment of AML. Here, we show that the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib as well as carfilzomib induces apoptosis through the intrinsic pathway more conspicuously in cells transformed by FLT3-TKD than FLT3-ITD. Mechanistically, bortezomib upregulated the stress-regulated protein REDD1 and induced downregulation of the mTORC1 pathway more distinctively in cells transformed by FLT3-TKD than FLT-ITD, while overexpression of Pim-1 partly prevented this downregulation and apoptosis in FLT3-TKD\u2013transformed cells. Genetic enhancement of the REDD1 induction or pharmacological inhibition of STAT5, Pim kinases, mTORC1, or S6K by specific inhibitors, such as pimozide, AZD1208, PIM447, rapamycin, and PF-4708671, accelerated the downregulation of mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway to enhance bortezomib-induced apoptosis in FLT3-ITD\u2013expressing cells, including primary AML cells, while overexpression of Mcl-1 prevented induction of apoptosis. Thus, FLT3-ITD confers a resistance to the proteasome inhibitors on AML cells by protecting the mTORC1/Mcl-1 pathway through the STAT5/Pim axis, and inhibition of these signaling events remarkably enhances the therapeutic efficacy.",

MITF amplification and downregulation have been observed in a significant proportion of melanoma patients and correlate with clinical outcomes. Here, we have investigated the effect of MITF on melanoma chemokine expression and immune cell attraction. In B16F10 melanoma cells, MITF knockdown reduced expression of CXCL10, with concomitantly decreased attraction of immune cells and accelerated tumor outgrowth. Conversely, overexpression of MITF in YUMM1.1 melanoma cells also led to an increased immune cell attraction in vitro. Subcutaneous YUMM1.1 melanomas overexpressing MITF however showed a reduced immune infiltration of lymphocytes and an increased tumor growth. In human melanoma cell lines, silencing of MITF enhanced chemokine production and immune cell attraction, while overexpression of MITF led to lower immune cell attraction. In summary, our results show that MITF regulates chemokine expression in murine and in human melanoma cells, and affects in vivo immune cell attraction and tumor growth. These results reveal a functional relationship between MITF and immune cell infiltration, which may be exploited for cancer therapy.",

Levels of \u03b1-SMA were measured in the fibroblast model, \u201cscar-in-a-jar\u201d, and in serum from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive lung disorder (COPD) and non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) belonging to two different cohorts. RESULTS: The novel \u03b1-SMA assay was developed and validated as technically robust. Based on the scar-in-a-jar results, \u03b1-SMA was only present in the fibroblasts activated by TGF-\u03b2. In cohort 1, levels of \u03b1-SMA were significantly higher in IPF, COPD and NSCLC patients compared to healthy controls (P = 0.04, P = 0.001 and P <0.0001, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for separation of healthy controls from IPF patients was 0.865, healthy controls from COPD patients was 0.892 and healthy controls from NSCLC patients was 0.983. In cohort 2, levels of \u03b1-SMA were also significantly higher in NSCLC patients compared to healthy controls (P = 0) and the AUROC for separating NSCLC and healthy controls was 0.715. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we developed and validated a robust competitive ELISA assay targeting the N-terminal of \u03b1-SMA. The level of \u03b1-SMA was upregulated when adding TGF-\u03b2, indicating that \u03b1-SMA is increased in activated fibroblasts. The level of \u03b1-SMA in circulation was significantly higher in patients with IPF, COPD and NSCLC compared to healthy controls. This assay could potentially be used as a novel noninvasive serological biomarker for lung disorders by providing a surrogate measure of activated fibroblasts.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Numerous studies investigated relationships between positron emission tomography and proliferation index Ki-67 in breast cancer (BC) with inconsistent results. The aim of the present analysis was to provide evident data about associations between standardized uptake value (SUV) and expression of Ki-67 in BC. METHODS: MEDLINE library, SCOPUS and EMBASE data bases were screened for relationships between SUV and Ki-67 in BC up to April 2018. Overall, 32 studies with 1802 patients were identified. The following data were extracted from the literature: authors, year of publication, number of patients, and correlation coefficients. Associations between SUV and Ki-67 were analyzed by Spearman's correlation coefficient. RESULTS: Associations between SUVmax derived from 18F-FDG PET and Ki-67 were reported in 25 studies (1624 patients). The pooled correlation coefficient was 0.40, (95% CI = [0.34; 0.46]). Furthermore, 7 studies analyzed associations between SUVmax derived from 18F-fluorthymidin (FLT) PET and Ki-67 (178 patients). The pooled correlation coefficient was 0.54, (95% CI = [0.37; 0.70]). CONCLUSION: SUVmax correlated moderately with expression of Ki-67 and, therefore, cannot be used as a surrogate marker for tumor proliferation. Further studies are needed to evaluate associations between PET parameters and histopathological findings like hormone receptor status in breast cancer.",

Preclinical models have shown that the combination of paclitaxel, sorafenib, and radiation therapy (RT) plays a crucial role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and breast cancer. This study aimed to investigate the involvement of mitochondrial cytochrome c\u2013dependent apoptosis in the mechanism of action of a combination of paclitaxel, sorafenib, and RT in RCC and breast cancer. RCC and breast cancer cell lines were exposed to paclitaxel and sorafenib alone or combined in the presence of radiation, and cell viability was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The synergistic anticancer effects of the combination therapy on cell cycle and intracellular signaling pathways were estimated using flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis. RCC and breast cancer cell line xenograft models were used to examine the antitumor activity in vivo. Our results suggest that paclitaxel, sorafenib, and RT synergistically decreased the viability of RCC and breast cancer cells and significantly induced their apoptosis, as shown by caspase-3 cleavage. Paclitaxel, sorafenib, and radiation cotreatment reduced antiapoptotic factor levels in these cells and, thereby, significantly reduced the tumor volume of RCC and breast cancer cell xenografts. The current study suggests that paclitaxel, sorafenib, and radiation cotreatment was more effective than cotreatment with paclitaxel or sorafenib and radiation. These findings may offer a new therapeutic approach to RCC and breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangement represents a landmark in the targeted therapy of non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is a sensitive and specific method to detect ALK protein expression, possibly an alternative to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). In this study, the concordance of FISH and IHC to determine ALK status was evaluated, particularly focusing on discordant cases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ALK status was tested by FISH and the IHC validated method (Ventana ALK (D5F3) CDx Assay) in 95 NSCLCs. Discordant cases were analyzed also by next-generation sequencing (NGS). The response to crizotinib of treated patients was recorded. RESULTS: Seven (7.3%) discordant cases were ALK FISH positive and IHC negative. They showed coexistent split signals pattern, with mean percentage of 15.4%, and 5\u2032 deletions pattern, with mean percentage 31.7%. Two cases had also gene amplification pattern. In three cases (42.8 %), the polysomy was observed. The NGS assay confirmed IHC results. In these patients, the treatment with crizotinib was ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: In our discordant cases, a coexistent complex pattern (deleted, split, and amplified/polysomic) of ALK gene was observed by FISH analysis. These complex rearranged cases were not detectable by IHC, and it could be speculated that more complex biological mechanisms could modulate protein expression. These data highlight the role of IHC and underscore the complexity of the genetic pattern of ALK. It could be crucial to consider these findings in order to best select patients for anti-ALK treatment in daily clinical practice.",

The average incidence of RIPF is 16%-28% after radiotherapy. RIPF includes a heterogeneous group of lung disorders characterized by progressive and irreversible destruction of lung architecture and disruption of gas exchange. The clinical signs of RIPF include increasing dyspnea, deteriorating lung function, and accumulation of interstitial fluid, eventually leading to respiratory failure. No medical therapy for RIPF has been approved for routine clinical use despite the apparent need for an effective treatment. Numerous signaling pathways are involved in the initiation and progression of RIPF. Also, various approaches for RIPF treatments have focused on several aspects of the current understanding of the molecular pathology of RIPF. This review used the mechanistic categories of associated cell signaling pathways, epithelial cell dysfunction and senescence, abnormal lung remodeling, and aberrant innate and adaptive immunity to review the published literature on RIPF to date and then to identify potential areas for the effective treatment of RIPF.",

The aim of this pooled analysis was to evaluate if presurgical CA19-9 level can also predict local control (LC) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). METHODS: Seven hundred patients with PaC from eight institutions who underwent surgical resection \u00b1 adjuvant treatment between 2000 and 2014 were analyzed. Patients were divided based on four presurgical CA19-9 level cutoffs (5, 37, 100, 353 U/ml). Weibull regression model to identify independent predictors of OS on 404 patients with complete information was fitted. RESULTS: Median follow-up was 17 months (range: 2-225 months). Univariate analysis showed a better prognosis in pT1-2, pN0, diameter <30 mm, or grade 1 tumors and in patients undergoing R0 resection, distal pancreatectomy, or adjuvant chemotherapy and with lower CA19-9 levels. Five-year OS, LC, and DMFS were as follows: CA19-9 <5.0: 5.7%, 47.2%, 17.0%; CA19-9 5.1-37.0: 37.9%, 63.3%, 46.0%; CA19-9 37.1-100.0: 27.1%, 59.4%, 39.0%; CA19-9 100.1-353.0: 17.4%, 43.4%, 26.7%; CA19-9 >353.1: 10.9%, 50.2%, and 23.4%, respectively.

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to evaluate associations of combined 18F-FDG-PET and MRI parameters with histopathological features in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: Overall, 22 patients with HNSCC were acquired (10 with G1/2 tumors and 12 with G3 tumors).18F-FDG-PET/CT and MRI was performed and maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) were estimated. Neck MRI was obtained on a 3 T scanner. Diffusion weighted imaging was performed with estimation of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Perfusion parameters Ktrans, Ve, and Kep were derived from dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging. Different combined PET/MRI parameters were calculated as ratios: PET parameters divided by ADC or DCE MRI parameters. The following histopathological features were estimated: Ki 67, EGFR, VEGF, p53, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1\u03b1, and cell count. Spearman's correlation coefficient (p) was used for correlation analysis. P < .05 was taken to indicate statistical significance. RESULTS: In overall sample, cellularity correlated with SUVmax/ADCmin (P\u202f=\u202f.558, P\u202f=\u202f.007), TLG/ADCmin (P\u202f=\u202f.546, P\u202f=\u202f.009), and MTV/ADCmin (P\u202f=\u202f.468, P\u202f=\u202f.028). MTV/Kep correlated with expression of HIF-1\u03b1 (P\u202f=\u202f.450, P\u202f=\u202f0,047). In G1/2 tumors, SUVmax/ADCmin correlated with HIF-1\u03b1 (P\u202f=\u202f\u2212.648, P\u202f=\u202f.043); MTV/Kep (P\u202f=\u202f\u2212.669, P\u202f=\u202f.034) and TLG/Kep (P\u202f=\u202f\u2212.644, P\u202f=\u202f.044) with Ki67. In G3 tumors, cellularity correlated with SUVmax/ADCmin (P\u202f=\u202f.832, P\u202f=\u202f.001), SUVmax/ADCmean (P\u202f=\u202f.741, P\u202f=\u202f.006), and TLG/ADCmin (P\u202f=\u202f.678, P\u202f=\u202f.015). MTV/ADCmin and TLG/ADCmin tended to correlate with HIF-1\u03b1. CONCLUSION: Combined parameters of 18F-FDG-PET and MRI can reflect Ki 67, tumor cellularity and expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in HNSCC.

No predictive biomarkers have yet been found for any available treatment options. Previously, we identified SERPINB7 as a putative biomarker for PDAC and thus, herein, we aimed to validate our previous findings and assessed the predictive value of SERPINB7. Patients who underwent surgery and received gemcitabine (gem) or gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel (gem/nab) as adjuvant therapy, between 2011 and 2017, were included in this study (n\u202f=\u202f57). Expression level of SERPINB7 was assessed in tumor tissue by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and RNA in situ hybridization (RNA ISH). Its association with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) was investigated. While IHC did not show any correlation between survival and the protein level of SERPINB7, RNA ISH revealed that expression of SERPINB7 was associated with a poor DFS (P\u202f=\u202f.01) and OS (P\u202f=\u202f.002) in the gem group but not in the gem/nab.

     "abstract": "Epithelial cells lining the intestinal mucosa constitute a selective-semipermeable barrier acting as first line of defense in the organism. The number of those cells remains constant during physiological conditions, but disruption of epithelial cell homeostasis has been observed in several pathologies. During colitis, epithelial cell proliferation decreases and cell death augments. The mechanism responsible for these changes remains unknown. Here, we show that the pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN\u03b3 contributes to the inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) by inducing the activation of mTORC1. Activation of mTORC1 in response to IFN\u03b3 was detected in IECs present along the crypt axis and in colonic macrophages. mTORC1 inhibition enhances cell proliferation, increases DNA damage in IEC. In macrophages, mTORC1 inhibition strongly reduces the expression of pro-inflammatory markers. As a consequence, mTORC1 inhibition exacerbated disease activity, increased mucosal damage, enhanced ulceration, augmented cell infiltration, decreased survival and stimulated tumor formation in a model of colorectal cancer CRC associated to colitis. Thus, our findings suggest that mTORC1 signaling downstream of IFN\u03b3 prevents epithelial DNA damage and cancer development during colitis.",

Here, we investigate the described correlation in other HPV-driven cancers, namely vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (VSCC). FFPE samples of 99 VSCC were analyzed by PCR for HPV-DNA-expression and by RT-qPCR for SLPI-mRNA-expression. Of 99 VSCC 10 (10.1%) are HPV-positive; 9 were HPV16; 1 HPV18; all were E6/E7 mRNA-positive. 33 of the 99 patients (33.3%) reported a smoking habit; 7 (21.1%) of these were HPV-positive. Of 66 (66.7%) non-smokers 3 (4.5%) were HPV-positive. SLPI-expression was 4.0-fold lower in HPV-positive than HPV-negative patients. Smoking resulted in 2.3-fold higher SLPI expression. The data presented here indicate that SLPI plays a pivotal role in HPV-infection not only in HNSCC but also in VSCC and possibly also in other HPV-driven cancers. This however, needs to be analyzed in future studies. Furthermore these data lead to the hypothesis that the smoking induced SLPI-increase is systemic rather than local, as assumed based on the HNSCC data.",

The ITH may affect diverse phenotypes such as treatment response, drug resistance, and clinical outcomes. It is crucial to consider ITH to understand tumorigenesis. METHODS: Genomic and transcriptomic profiles of prostate cancer patients were investigated to determine which markers are correlated with the degree of tumor heterogeneity. In addition, the correlation between the immune activity and clonality of tumors was examined. RESULTS: Tumor heterogeneity across all prostate cancer samples was variable. However, ITH events were dependent on genomic and clinical features. Interestingly, prostate-specific antigen score increased in tumors with multiple subclones, indicating high-grade tumor heterogeneity. On the other hand, CD8-positive T-cell activation decreased in highly heterogeneous tumors. Intriguingly, PTEN deletion was prominently enriched in high heterogeneity groups, with a strong association with heterozygous loss. Expression of major genes including PTEN, CDC42EP5, RNLS, GP2, NETO2, and AMPD3 was closely related to tumor heterogeneity in association with PTEN deletion. CONCLUSIONS: In prostate cancer, ITH, a potential factor affecting tumor progression, is associated with PTEN deletion and cytotoxic T cell inactivation.",

Vimentin was constitutively phosphorylated at Ser56 but vimentin associated with NEDD9-was not phosphorylated at Ser56. In contrast, NMIIA bound to NEDD9 was phosphorylated on S1943 consistent with its function in invasion and secretion. Treatment of cells with the vimentin-targeting steroidal lactone withaferin A had no effect on vimentin turnover as previously reported, instead causing NEDD9 cleavage and cell death. The NMIIA-selective inhibitor blebbistatin induced cells to form long extensions and attenuated secretion of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9. While the site of vimentin interaction on NEDD9 was not defined, NMIIA was found to interact with NEDD9 at its substrate domain. NEDD9 interactions with vimentin and NMIIA are consistent with these proteins having roles in MMP secretion and cell invasion. These findings suggest that a better understanding of NEDD9 signaling is likely to reveal novel therapeutic targets for the prevention of invasion and metastasis.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) provide histologically accurate cancer models that recapitulate patient malignant phenotype and allow for highly correlative oncologic in-vivo downstream translational studies. Primary PDX engraftment failure has significant negative consequences on programmatic efficiency and resource utilization and is due to either no tumor growth or development of lymphoproliferative tumors. We aimed to determine if secondary engraftment of previously cryopreserved patient tumor tissues would allow salvage of PDX models that failed previous primary engraftment and increase overall engraftment efficiency. METHODS: Patient hepatobiliary and pancreatic cancers that failed primary engraftment were identified. Previously cryopreserved primary patient cancerous tissues were implanted into immunodeficient mice (NOD/SCID). Mice were monitored, growth metrics calculated, and secondary engraftment outcomes were recorded. Established PDX were verified and compared to original patient tissue through multiple generations by a GI pathologist. RESULTS: We identified 55 patient tumors that previously failed primary engraftment: no tumor growth (n\u202f=\u202f46, 84%) or lymphoproliferative tumor (LT) (n\u202f=\u202f9, 16%). After secondary implantation using cryopreserved patient tissues, 29 new histologically validated PDX models were generated with an overall secondary engraftment rate of 53% for all tumor types with greatest yield in pancreatic and biliary tract cancers. Of the secondary engraftment failures (n\u202f=\u202f26), 21 (38%) were due to no growth and 5 (9%) developed LT. CONCLUSION: Secondary PDX engraftment using cryopreserved primary cancerous is feasible after previous failed engraftment attempts and can result in a 50% increase in overall engraftment efficiency with decreases in LT formation. This technique allows for salvage of critical patient PDX models that would otherwise not exist. SYNOPSIS: Patient-derived xenografts have many important translational applications however can be limited by engraftment failure. We demonstrate optimized methodology utilizing cryopreservation of primary tumor tissue that allows for subsequent successful secondary engraftment and creation of PDX models that failed previous primary engraftment and allowed salvage of patient PDX models that would otherwise not exist.",

     "abstract": "Tumor hypoxia contributes to therapy resistance and metastatic progression of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). We postulated that the tumor mitochondrial metabolism, manifested by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage, reflects how hypoxic conditions connect to cancer-induced systemic inflammation and poor outcome. Levels of ROS and mtDNA damage were analyzed in three colorectal cancer (CRC) cell lines cultured for 24\u202fhours under normoxia (21% O2) or hypoxia (0.2% O2) and serum sampled at the time of diagnosis from 35 LARC patients participating in a prospective therapy study. Compared with normoxia, ROS were significantly repressed and mtDNA damage was significantly enhanced in the hypoxic CRC cell lines; hence, a low ratio of ROS to mtDNA damage was an indicator of hypoxic conditions. In the LARC patients, low serum ROS were associated with elevated levels of circulating carcinoembryonic antigen and tumor choline concentration, both indicative of unfavorable biology, as well as adverse progression-free and overall survival. A low ratio of ROS to mtDNA damage in serum was associated with poor local tumor response to the neoadjuvant treatment and, of note, elevated systemic inflammation factors (C-reactive protein, the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and factors involved in tumor necrosis factor signaling), indicating that deficient treatment response locally and detrimental inflammation systemically link to a hypoxic mitochondrial metabolism. In conclusion, serum ROS and damaged mtDNA may be markers of the mitochondrial metabolism driven by the state of oxygenation of the primary tumor and possibly implicated in systemic inflammation and adverse outcome of LARC.",

     "abstract": "High-risk neuroblastoma continues to carry a poor prognosis. Nearly 50% of these tumors relapse following extensive treatment regimens. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a tumor suppressor, has been shown to be downregulated in many human cancers via multiple mechanisms including upregulation of its endogenous inhibitors, I2PP2A or CIP2A. We hypothesized that inhibition of the endogenous PP2A inhibitors or activation of PP2A would decrease tumorigenicity in human neuroblastoma cells. Four human neuroblastoma cell lines were utilized. Expression of PP2A and its endogenous inhibitors I2PP2A and CIP2A was confirmed by immunoblotting. PP2A activation was measured via phosphatase activation assay. Multiple parallel methods including siRNA inhibition of the endogenous PP2A inhibitors and pharmacologic activation of PP2A were utilized. Cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion assays were performed. In vivo studies were utilized to determine the effects of PP2A activation on neuroblastoma tumor growth. Inhibition of the endogenous inhibitors of PP2A or pharmacologic activation of PP2A with the PP2A activator FTY720 led to decreased neuroblastoma cell viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion. Treatment of mice bearing SK-N-AS or SK-N-BE(2) neuroblastoma tumors with FTY720 resulted in a significant decrease in tumor growth compared to vehicle-treated animals. In conclusion, activation of PP2A may provide a novel therapeutic target for neuroblastoma.",

     "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant tumor that arises from the cerebellum of the central nervous system. Clinically, medulloblastomas are treated by surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, all of which result in toxicity and morbidity. Recent reports have identified that DDX3, a member of the RNA helicase family, is mutated in medulloblastoma. In this study, we demonstrate the role of DDX3 in driving medulloblastoma. With the use of a small molecule inhibitor of DDX3, RK-33, we could inhibit growth and promote cell death in two medulloblastoma cell lines, DAOY and UW228, with IC50 values of 2.5 \u03bcM and 3.5 \u03bcM, respectively. Treatment of DAOY and UW228 cells with RK-33 caused a G1 arrest, resulted in reduced TCF reporter activity, and reduced mRNA expression levels of downstream target genes of the WNT pathway, such as Axin2, CCND1, MYC, and Survivin. In addition, treatment of DAOY and UW228 cells with a combination of RK-33 and radiation exhibited a synergistic effect. Importantly, the combination of RK-33 and 5 Gy radiation caused tumor regression in a mouse xenograft model of medulloblastoma. Using immunohistochemistry, we observed DDX3 expression in both pediatric (55%) and adult (66%) medulloblastoma patients. Based on these results, we conclude that RK-33 is a promising radiosensitizing agent that inhibits DDX3 activity and down-regulates WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling and could be used as a frontline therapeutic strategy for DDX3-expressing medulloblastomas in combination with radiation.",

CSF-1R is an important mediator of breast cancer development, metastasis, and survival. We confirm that vigilin decreases in vitro reporter luciferase activity as well as the translation rate of target mRNAs. We further explore the mechanism of suppression of CSF-1R. We show that the 69 nt binding element has profound effects on translation efficiency of CSF-1R mRNA, not seen in the presence of mutation of the element. Also, mutation of the 69 nt element in the CSF-1R mRNA 3\u2032UTR both interferes with direct vigilin binding and obviates effect of vigilin overexpression on translational repression of CSF-1R. We show that stable vigilin binding requires the full length 69 nt CSF-1R element, including the 26 nt pyrimidine-rich core. Furthermore, titration of endogenous vigilin and other proteins which bind the 69 nt element, by exogenously introduced CSF-1R mRNA 3\u2032UTR containing the pyrimidine-rich sequence, increases the adhesion, motility, and invasion of breast cancer cells. This phenotypic effect is not seen when the 69 nt element is deleted. Lastly, we are the first to show that human breast tissues exhibit strong vigilin expression in normal breast epithelium. Our pilot data suggest decreased vigilin protein expression, along with shift from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic location, in the transition to ductal carcinoma in situ.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Translocations of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) can be effectively targeted in advanced non-small cell lung cancer by ALK-TKI inhibitors including Crizotinib. However, the development of acquired resistance often limits the duration of these therapies. While several mechanisms of secondary resistance have been already identified, little is known about molecular determinants of primary resistance. In our brief report we investigated the tumor molecular profile of a patient who failed to respond to Crizotinib. METHODS: Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) were run on tumor specimen as well as search and characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the blood. Confirmation of clinical findings was achieved using a translational cell-line in vitro model. RESULTS: We identified the amplification of MYC as a potential new mechanism of primary resistance to ALK inhibition. Human EML4-ALK rearranged cells infected with a lentiviral vector carrying full-length human MYC cDNA were treated in vitro with crizotinib and alectinib. Overexpression of MYC overexpression was associated with a reduced sensitivity to both ALK-inhibitors. MYC-overexpressing clones displayed also increased levels of both cyclin D and E and their growth was reduced by using Cdk4/6 inhibitors such as Palbociclib. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that the MYC gene may be implicated in the mechanism of primary resistance to ALK inhibitors. We also suggest potential MYC-directed inhibition strategies to overcome primary resistance in advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tumor cell invasion is a hallmark of glioblastoma (GBM) and a major contributing factor for treatment failure, tumor recurrence, and the poor prognosis of GBM. Despite this, our understanding of the molecular machinery that drives invasion is limited. METHODS: Time-lapse imaging of patient-derived GBM cell invasion in a 3D collagen gel matrix, analysis of both the cellular invasive phenotype and single cell invasion pattern with microarray expression profiling. RESULTS: GBM invasion was maintained in a simplified 3D-milieue. Invasion was promoted by the presence of the tumorsphere graft. In the absence of this, the directed migration of cells subsided. The strength of the pro-invasive repulsive signaling was specific for a given patient-derived culture. In the highly invasive GBM cultures, the majority of cells had a neural progenitor-like phenotype, while the less invasive cultures had a higher diversity in cellular phenotypes. Microarray expression analysis of the non-invasive cells from the tumor core displayed a higher GFAP expression and a signature of genes containing VEGFA, hypoxia and chemo-repulsive signals. Cells of the invasive front expressed higher levels of CTGF, TNFRSF12A and genes involved in cell survival, migration and cell cycle pathways. A mesenchymal gene signature was associated with increased invasion. CONCLUSION: The GBM tumorsphere core promoted invasion, and the invasive front was dominated by a phenotypically defined cell population expressing genes regulating traits found in aggressive cancers. The detected cellular heterogeneity and transcriptional differences between the highly invasive and core cells identifies potential targets for manipulation of GBM invasion.",

     "abstract": "The oncogene ERG encodes an ETS family transcription factor and is implicated in blood, vascular, and bone development and in prostate, blood, and bone cancer. The ERG gene is alternatively spliced; of particular interest is its cassette exon 7b which adds 24 amino acids, in frame, to the transcriptional activation domain. Higher exon 7b inclusion rates are associated with increased cell proliferation and advanced prostate cancer. The 24 amino acids encoded by exon 7b show evolutionary conservation from humans to echinoderms, highlighting their functional importance. Throughout evolution, these 24 amino acids are encoded by a distinct short exon. Splice-switching oligonucleotides based on morpholino chemistry were designed to induce skipping of ERG exon 7b in MG63 osteosarcoma and VCaP prostate cancer cells. Induction of exon 7b skipping reduced cell proliferation and invasion, increased apoptosis in vitro, and reduced xenograft growth in vivo. We also show that ERG's exon 7b is required for the induction of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. Together, these findings show that the evolutionarily conserved cassette exon 7b is central to ERG's oncogenic properties.",

RESULTS: CX-4945 dose-dependently decreased viability of HuCCT1, EGI-1, and Liv27 and decreased phospho-AKT/total AKT and phospho-PTEN/total PTEN ratios. CX-4945 significantly increased caspase 3/7 activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner. CX-4945 significantly enhanced the effect of gemcitabine or cisplatin on HuCCT1, EGI-1, and Liv27 cells and inhibited the phosphorylation of DNA repairing enzymes XRCC1 and MDC1. Further, CX-4945 alone significantly inhibited growth of HuCCT1 mouse xenograft tumors. Combining CX-4945 with gemcitabine and cisplatin was more potent than CX-4945 alone or gemcitabine/cisplatin. The effect of CX-4945 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, the PI3K/AKT pathway, and DNA repair was confirmed in the mouse xenografts. CONCLUSION: CX-4945 has an antiproliferative effect on CCA and enhances the effect of gemcitabine and cisplatin through its inhibitory effect on the PI3K/AKT pathway and DNA repair.",

Additionally, we analyzed up to 428 esophageal adenocarcinomas (EACs) in total using an ultra-deep parallel sequencing panel, immunohistochemistry, as well as fluorescence in situ hybridization. In the TCGA cohort, 17.3% has a biallelic intact TP53 gene. This group has a smaller average total size of somatic copy number variations. Some protein coding genes and miRNAs were differentially expressed between the TP53-wild-type and TP53-mutated group to emphasize mdm2, CCND2, TP73, or miRNA 150, 488, or 4662a. In addition, 50% of the TP53\u2013wild-type tumors carry somatic mutations in at least one of the genes involved in the TP53 pathway. Our patient cohort revealed 41.3% TP53\u2013wild-type tumors; 5.6% were MDM2 amplified. In accordance with the TCGA data, we did not find a prognostic relevance of TP53 in our tumor cohort as well.

However, patients show divergent therapy responses, and the molecular determinants of taxane sensitivity have remained elusive. Especially the signaling pathways that promote death of the taxane-treated cells are poorly characterized. Here we describe a novel part of a signaling route in which c-Myc enhances paclitaxel sensitivity through upregulation of miR-203b-3p and miR-203a-3p; two clustered antiapoptosis protein Bcl-xL controlling microRNAs. In vitro, the miR-203b-3p decreases the expression of Bcl-xL by direct targeting of the gene's mRNA 3\u2019UTR. Notably, overexpression of the miR-203b-3p changed the fate of paclitaxel-treated breast and ovarian cancer cells from mitotic slippage to cell death. In breast tumors, high expression of the miR-203b-3p and MYC was associated with better therapy response and patient survival. Interestingly, in the breast tumors, MYC expression correlated negatively with BCL2L1 expression but positively with miR-203b-3p and miR-203a-3p. Finally, silencing of MYC suppressed the transcription of both miRNAs in breast tumor cells. Pending further validation, these results may assist in patient stratification for taxane therapy.",

Our study revealed that establishment of tumors by transplantation of spheroids significantly improved subcutaneous xenograft model of PDAC, which stays the most widely used animal model for testing of new drugs and drug delivery approaches. Spheroid based tumors abundantly produced different extracellular matrix (ECM) components including collagen I, fibronectin, laminin and hyaluronic acid. These tumors were highly reproducible with excellent uniformity in terms of ECM architecture recapitulating clinical PDAC tumors, whereas in more common cell based xenografts a significant intertumor heterogeneity in extracellular matrix production was found. Moreover, spheroid based xenografts demonstrated higher expression of pro-fibrotic and pro-survival PDAC hallmarks in opposite to cell based counterparts. We believe that future development of this model will provide an effective instrument for testing of anti-cancer drugs with improved predictive value.",

It has been reported to play crucial roles in the regulation of calcium homeostasis, apoptosis, vesicle trafficking, cancer development, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Overexpression of sorcin has been reported to be associated with different cancers such as breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, nasopharyngeal cancer, ovarian cancer, etc. Essentially, expression of sorcin has been found to be elevated in cancer cells as compared to normal cells, indicating that it has prominent role in cancer. Moreover, sorcin was found to be the regulator of various proteins that has an association with carcinogenesis including NF-\u03baB, STAT3, Akt, ERK1/2, VEGF, MMPs, caspases, etc. Sorcin was also found to regulate apoptosis, as silencing of the same resulted in increased levels of proapoptotic genes and induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in cancer. Interestingly, mutations in the sorcin gene have been closely linked with poor overall survival in bladder cancer, brain lower-grade glioma, glioblastoma, glioblastoma multiforme, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma. Additionally, overexpression of sorcin was also found to induce MDR against different chemotherapeutic drugs. All these findings mark the importance of sorcin in cancer development and MDR. Therefore, there is urgent need to explore the functional mechanism of sorcin and to analyze whether silencing of sorcin would able to chemosensitize MDR cells.

TP53 was the most frequently mutated gene in the investigation and validation sets (78.6% and 67.4%, respectively). Differential expression analysis between tumor and nontumor adjacent mucosa showed 6698 differentially expressed genes, most of which were overexpressed (74%). Enrichment analysis identified overrepresentation of Wnt pathway, with overexpressed activators and underexpressed inactivators, suggesting activation of canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. Higher WNT7B expression was associated with poor prognosis. Twenty-one gene fusions were identified in 50% of tumors, none of which involving the same genes in different patients; 71% of fusions involved syntenic genes.

Somatic mutations in TP53 are associated with the development of anaplasia and with poorer survival, particularly in advanced-stage disease. Early identification of DAWT harboring TP53 abnormalities could improve risk stratification of initial therapy and monitoring for recurrence. METHODS: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was used to evaluate 21 samples from 4 patients with DAWT. For each patient, we assessed TP53 status in frozen tumor, matched germline DNA, and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) from plasma, serum, and urine collected throughout treatment. RESULTS: Mutant TP53 was detectable in ctDNA from plasma and serum in all patients. We did not detect variant TP53 in the same volume (200 \u03bcl) of urine. One patient displayed heterogeneity of TP53 in the tumor despite both histological sections displaying anaplasia. Concentration of ctDNA from plasma/serum taken prenephrectomy varied significantly between patients, ranging from 0.44 (0.05-0.90) to 125.25 (109.75-140.25) copies/\u03bcl. We observed variation in ctDNA throughout treatment, and in all but one patient, ctDNA levels fell significantly following nephrectomy. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate for the first time that ddPCR is an effective method for detection of mutant TP53 in ctDNA from children with DAWT even when there is intratumoral somatic heterogeneity. This should be further explored in a larger cohort of patients, as early detection of circulating variant TP53 may have significant clinical impact on future risk stratification and surveillance.",

We herein analyzed the proteomes of primary PDAC tumors subjected to additive chemoradiation after surgical resection and achieving short PFS (median 6 months) versus prolonged PFS (median 28 months). Proteomic analysis revealed the overexpression of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 1 Family Member A1 (ALDH1A1) and Monoamine Oxidase A (MAOA) in the short PFS cohort, which were corroborated by immunohistochemistry. In vitro, specific inhibition of ALDH1A1 by A37 in combination with gemcitabine, radiation, and chemoradiation lowered cell viability and augmented cell death in MiaPaCa-2 and Panc 05.04 cells. ALDH1A1 silencing in both cell lines dampened cell proliferation, cell metabolism, and colony formation. In MiaPaCa-2 cells, ALDH1A1 silencing sensitized cells towards treatment with gemcitabine, radiation or chemoradiation. In Panc 05.04, increased cell death was observed upon gemcitabine treatment only. These findings are in line with previous studies that have suggested a role of ALDH1A1 chemoradiation resistance, e.g., in esophageal cancer. In summary, we present one of the first proteome studies to investigate the responsiveness of PDAC to chemoradiation and provide further evidence for a role of ALDH1A1 in therapy resistance.",

Positive PD-L1 staining was significantly associated with later disease stage (stages III and IV) (P value = .0379) and lymph node metastasis (P value = .0466) in the Hong Kong cohort. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression was significantly induced in ESCC cell lines after standard chemotherapy treatments, along with EGFR and ERK activation in both in vitro studies and the in vivo esophageal orthotopic model. The endogenous expression of PD-L1 was reduced by treatment with an EGFR inhibitor (erlotinib) or by the knockdown of EGFR. Moreover, the upregulation of PD-L1 by chemotherapy was also attenuated by the treatment with erlotinib and a MAPK/MEK inhibitor (AZD6244), suggesting that PD-L1 is regulated by the EGFR/ERK pathway in ESCC. The regulation of PD-L1 by the EGFR pathway was further supported by the correlation of PD-L1 and EGFR expression observed in the commercially available tissue microarray set (P value = .028). Taken together, the current study was the first to demonstrate the upregulation of PD-L1 by chemotherapy in ESCC and its regulation through the EGFR/ERK pathway.

Eight independent prognostic factors for both OS and BCSS were identified and integrated for the construction of the nomograms. The calibration curves showed optimal agreement between the predicted and observed probabilities. The C-indexes of the nomograms in the training cohort were higher than those of the TNM staging system for predicting OS (0.724 vs 0.694; P < .001) and BCSS (0.733 vs 0.702; P < .001). Additionally, significant differences in survival were observed in patients stratified into different risk groups within respective TNM categories. CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated novel nomograms that can accurately predict OS and BCSS in young women with breast cancer. These nomograms may help clinicians in making decisions on an individualized basis.",

     "abstract": "TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer and thus an attractive target for novel cancer therapy. Several compounds that can reactive mutant p53 protein have been identified. APR-246 is currently being tested in a phase II clinical trial in high-grade serous ovarian cancer. We have used RNA-seq analysis to study the effects of APR-246 on gene expression in human breast cancer cell lines. Although the effect of APR-246 on gene expression was largely cell line dependent, six genes were upregulated across all three cell lines studied, i.e., TRIM16, SLC7A11, TXNRD1, SRXN1, LOC344887, and SLC7A11-AS1. We did not detect upregulation of canonical p53 target genes such as CDKN1A (p21), 14-3-3\u03c3, BBC3 (PUMA), and PMAIP1 (NOXA) by RNA-seq, but these genes were induced according to analysis by qPCR. Gene ontology analysis showed that APR-246 induced changes in pathways such as response to oxidative stress, gene expression, cell proliferation, response to nitrosative stress, and the glutathione biosynthesis process. Our results are consistent with the dual action of APR-246, i.e., reactivation of mutant p53 and modulation of redox activity. SLC7A11, TRIM16, TXNRD1, and SRXN1 are potential new pharmacodynamic biomarkers for assessing the response to APR-246 in both preclinical and clinical studies.",

From 2008 to 2011, patients with esophageal cancer who had undergone postoperative RT in five different hospitals in China were reviewed. Clinical data, including time interval between surgery to RT, were prospectively collected. Kaplan-Meier method was conducted to estimate the effect of each variable on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with differences assessed by log-rank test. Univariate Cox proportional-hazards models were performed for both PFS and OS for all assumed predictor variables. Statistically significant predictor variables (P < .05) on univariate analysis were then included in multivariate Cox proportional-hazards models, which were performed to compare the effects of RT delay on PFS and OS. A total of 316 patients were finally enrolled in this prospectively multicentric study. Time to RT after surgery varied from 12 days to over 60 days (median, 26 days). Multivariate analysis showed that delay to RT longer than the median does not appear to be a survival cost. There was also no statistically difference in PFS (P = .513) or OS (P = .236) between patients stratified by quartiles (\u226421 days vs \u226735 days). However, patients with particularly long delays (\u226742 days) demonstrated a detrimental impact on OS (P = .021) but not PFS (P = .580). Delaying postoperative RT of esophageal cancer does not impact PFS, but results in a significant reduction on OS if delaying longer than 6 weeks.",

Here, we sequenced the genomes of 16 short-term responders (SR) that had progression-free survival (PFS) of less than 6 months on the first-generation EGFR TKI and compared them to 12 long-term responders (LR) that had more than 24 months of PFS. All patients were diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and harbored EGFR 19del or L858R mutations before treatment. Paired tumor samples collected before treatment and after relapse (or at the last follow-up) were subjected to targeted next-generation sequencing of 416 cancer-related genes. SR patients were significantly younger than LR patients (P < .001). Collectively, 88% of SR patients had TP53 variations compared to 13% of LR patients (P < .001). Additionally, 37.5% of SR patients carried EGFR amplifications compared to 8% of LR patients. Other potential primary resistance factors were also identified in the pretreatment samples of 12 SR patients (75%), including PTEN loss; BIM deletion polymorphism; and amplifications of EGFR, ERBB2, MET, HRAS, and AKT2. Comparatively, only three LR patients (25%) were detected with EGFR or AKT1 amplifications that could possibly exert resistance.

METHODS: 94 hepatic focal lesions, including 38 HCC, 16 metastasis, 12 focal nodular hyperplasia, 13 cholangiocarcinoma, and 15 hemangioma, were examined in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired with 13 b values (b\u202f=\u202f0, 3, \u2026, 500 s/mm2) to measure the adaptive multi-exponential IVIM parameters, namely, pure diffusion coefficient (D), diffusion fraction (fd), pseudo-diffusion coefficient (Di*) and perfusion-related diffusion fraction (fi) of the ith perfusion component. Comparison of the parameters of and their diagnostic performance was determined using Mann-Whitney U test, independent-sample t test, one-way analysis of variance, Z test and receiver-operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: D, D1* and D2* presented significantly difference between HCCs and other hepatic lesions, whereas fd, f1 and f2 did not show statistical differences. In the differential diagnosis of HCCs from other hepatic lesions, D2* (AUC, 0.927) provided best diagnostic performance among all parameters. Additionally, the number of exponential terms in the model was also an important indicator for distinguishing HCCs from other hepatic lesions. In the benign and malignant analysis, D gave the greatest AUC values, 0.895 or 0.853, for differentiation between malignant and benign lesions with three or two exponential terms. Most parameters were not significantly different between hypovascular and hypervascular lesions. For multiple comparisons, significant differences of D, D1* or D2* were found between certain lesion types.

To investigate the genetic mechanisms of tumor relapse and therapy resistance, we characterized genomic alterations in diagnostic and relapsed lesions in patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric solid tumors using targeted deep sequencing. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A targeted sequencing panel covering the exons of 381 cancer genes was used to characterize 19 paired diagnostic and relapsed samples from patients with relapsed/refractory pediatric solid tumors. RESULTS: The mean coverage for all samples was 930.6\u00d7 (SD = 213.8). Among the 381 genes, 173 single nucleotide variations (SNVs)/insertion-deletions (InDels), 100 copy number alterations, and 1 structural variation were detected. A total of 72.6% of SNVs in primary tumors were also found in recurrent lesions, and 27.2% of SNVs in recurrent tumors had newly occurred. Among SNVs/InDels detected only in recurrent lesions, 71% had a low variant allele fraction (<10%). Patients were classified into three categories based on the mutation patterns after cancer treatment. A significant association between the major mutation patterns and clinical outcome was observed. Patients whose relapsed tumor had fewer mutations than the diagnostic sample tended to be older, had longer progression-free survival, and achieved complete remission after relapse. Contrastingly, patients whose genetic profile only had concordant mutations without any change had the worst outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized genomic changes in recurrent pediatric solid tumors. These findings could help to understand the biology of relapsed childhood cancer and to develop personalized treatment based on their genetic profile.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: To validate Gaussian normalized cerebral blood volume (GN-nCBV) by association with overall survival (OS) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients and compare this association with current standard white matter normalized cerebral blood volume (WN-nCBV). METHODS: We retrieved spin-echo echo-planar dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI acquired after maximal resection and prior to radiation therapy between 2006 and 2011 in 51 adult patients (28 male, 23 female; age 23-87 years) with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Software code was developed in house to perform Gaussian normalization of CBV to the standard deviation of the whole brain CBV. Three expert readers manually selected regions of interest in tumor and normal-appearing white matter on CBV maps. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves associating nCBV with 15-month OS were calculated for both GN-nCBV and WN-nCBV. Reproducibility and interoperator variability were compared using within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). RESULTS: GN-nCBV ICC (\u22650.82) and wCV (\u226421%) were superior to WN-nCBV ICC (0.54-0.55) and wCV (\u226546%). The area under the ROC curve analysis demonstrated both GN-nCBV and WN-nCBV to be good predictors of OS, but GN-nCBV was consistently superior, although the difference was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: GN-nCBV has a slightly better association with clinical gold standard OS than conventional WM-nCBV in our glioblastoma patient cohort. This equivalent or superior validity, combined with the advantages of higher reproducibility, lower interoperator variability, and easier automation, makes GN-nCBV superior to WM-nCBV for clinical and research use in glioma patients. We recommend widespread adoption and incorporation of GN-nCBV into commercial dynamic susceptibility contrast processing software.",

     "abstract": "The most common primary central nervous system tumor in adults is the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The highly invasive nature of GBM cells is a significant factor resulting in the inevitable tumor recurrence and poor patient prognosis. Tumor cells utilize structures known as invadopodia to faciliate their invasive phenotype. In this study, utilizing an array of techniques, including gelatin matrix degradation assays, we show that GBM cell lines can form functional gelatin matrix degrading invadopodia and secrete matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), a known invadopodia-associated matrix-degrading enzyme. Furthermore, these cellular activities were augmented in cells that survived radiotherapy and temozolomide treatment, indicating that surviving cells may possess a more invasive phenotype posttherapy. We performed a screen of FDA-approved agents not previously used for treating GBM patients with the aim of investigating their \u201canti-invadopodia\u201d and cytotoxic effects in GBM cell lines and identified a number that reduced cell viability, as well as agents which also reduced invadopodia activity. Importantly, two of these, pacilitaxel and vinorelbine tartrate, reduced radiation/temozolomide-induced invadopodia activity. Our data demonstrate the value of testing previously approved drugs (repurposing) as potential adjuvant agents for the treatment of GBM patients to reduce invadopodia activity, inhibit GBM cell invasion, and potentially improve patient outcome.",

Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the efficacy and safety of RT plus EGFR-TKIs in those patients. Materials and Methods: Relevant literatures published between 2012 and 2017 were searched. Objective response rate(ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall survival (OS), intracranial progression-free survival (I-PFS) and adverse events (AEs) were extracted. The combined hazard ratios (HRs) and relative risks (RRs) were calculated using random effects models. Results: Twenty-four studies (2810 patients) were included in the analysis. Overall, RT plus EGFR-TKIs had higher ORR (RR\u202f=\u202f1.32, 95%CI: 1.13\u20131.55), DCR (RR\u202f=\u202f1.12, 95%CI: 1.04\u20131.22), and longer OS (HR\u202f=\u202f0.72, 95%CI: 0.59\u20130.89), I-PFS (HR\u202f=\u202f0.64, 95%CI: 0.50\u20130.82) than monotherapy, although with higher overall AEs (20.2% vs 11.8%, RR\u202f=\u202f1.34, 95% CI: 1.11\u20131.62). Furthermore, subgroup analyses found concurrent RT plus EGFR-TKIs could prolong OS (HR\u202f=\u202f0.69, 95%CI: 0.55\u20130.86) and I-PFS (HR\u202f=\u202f0.57, 95%CI: 0.44\u20130.75).

Grade 1 lesions were diagnosed in 101 (68.2%) cases, grade 2 in 41 (27.7%) patients, and grade 3 in 6 (4.1%) patients. All tumors were investigated by MRI (1.5 T scanner) by using diffusion weighted imaging (b values of 0 and 1000 s/mm2).

However, the knowledge of genome scale expression of lncRNAs and their potential biological function in gastric cancer is still lacking. Next generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on tumor tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues of six diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) patients. Then we performed a comprehensive analysis on lncRNAs and mRNA. Fifty-eight lncRNAs were upregulated and 54 lncRNAs were downregulated in diffuse gastric cancer tissue compared with adjacent tissue. The numbers of up- and downregulated mRNAs were 306 and 161, respectively. In addition, we inferred the function of lncRNAs by construction of a co-expression network for deregulated mRNAs and lncRNAs. Co-expressed genes of MEF2C-AS1 and FENDRR were enriched to RAS and TGF-beta signaling pathway. MEF2C-AS1 and FENDRR expression were re-evaluated by Real-time Quantitative PCR in 42 DGC patients' tumor and normal tissues, and other 46 DGC patents' and 21 healthy controls' plasma. Validation data showed MEF2C-AS1 and FENDRR were significantly downregulated in tumor tissues compared with normal tissues. And decreased FENDRR are associated with aggressive tumor characteristics including more advanced stage (P = .030), poor differentiation (P = .043) and lymphatic metastasis (P = .001). The expression level MEF2C-AS1 was significantly lower in DGC patients' plasma than that in healthy controls' plasma. In gastric cancer cell lines, knock-down of MEF2C-AS1 or FENDRR reduced the protein levels of FAT3, NTN1 and LYVE1 (the co-expressed genes), which were related with gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion by previous studies. In addition, knock-down of MEF2C-AS1 or FENDRR promoted aggressive tumor behaviors in in-vitro assays. In this study, we provide a valuable resource of lncRNAs which might play important roles in the function of oncogenes or tumor suppressors affecting the development and progression of diffuse gastric cancer.",

Receptor-interacting protein of 140 kDa (RIP140) and ligand-dependent corepressor (LCoR), two transcriptional co-regulators of estrogen receptors, strongly interact in BC cells. Although their role in cancer progression has been outlined in the last few years, their function in BC has not been elucidated yet. In this study, we investigated RIP140 and LCoR localization (cytoplasm vs nucleus) in BC samples from a well-characterized cohort of patients (n\u202f=\u202f320). RIP140 and LCoR were expressed in more than 80% of tumors, (predominantly in the cytoplasm), and the two markers were highly correlated. Expression of RIP140 and LCoR in the nucleus was negatively correlated with tumor size. Conversely, RIP140 and LCoR cytoplasmic expression strongly correlated with expression of two tumor aggressiveness markers: N-cadherin and CD133 (epithelial mesenchymal transition and cancer stem cell markers, respectively). Finally, high RIP140 nuclear expression was significantly correlated with longer overall survival, whereas high total or cytoplasmic expression of RIP140 was associated with shorter disease-free survival. Our study strongly suggests that the role of RIP140 and LCoR in BC progression could vary according to their prevalent sub-cellular localization, with opposite prognostic values for nuclear and cytoplasmic expression. The involvement in BC progression/invasiveness of cytoplasmic RIP140 could be balanced by the anti-tumor action of nuclear RIP140, thus explaining the previous contradictory findings about its role in BC.",

METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for patients with PNETs between 2004 and 2015. Patients were randomly separated into the training set and the validation set. Cox regression model was used in training set to obtain independent prognostic factors to develop a nomogram for predicting overall survival (OS). The discrimination and calibration plots were used to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the nomogram. RESULTS: A total of 3142 patients with PNETs were collected from the SEER database.

The nomogram for predicting OS displayed better discrimination power than the Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage systems 7th edition in the training set and validation set. The calibration curve indicated that the nomogram was able to accurately predict 3- and 5-year OS. CONCLUSIONS: The nomogram which could predict 3- and 5-year OS were established in this study.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The pre- and post-nCR CT and PET data for 14 patients with resectable or borderline resectable pancreatic head adenocarcinoma treated with nCR followed by surgery were retrospectively analyzed. These data were compared with the PTR which were graded according to tumor cell destruction (cellularity), with Grade 0, 1, 2 or 3 (G0, G1, G2 or G3) for complete, moderate, minimal and poor responses, respectively. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was defined using body-weight (SUVbw). PERCIST1.0 was defined using lean-body mass normalized SUV (SUVlb or SUL). RECIST1.1 was defined by contouring the whole pancreas head on the CT image. Pre- and post-SUL-peak and SUVmax, RECIST1.1 and PETRECIST1.0 were correlated with PTR using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient test. RESULTS: The average mean and SD in SUL-peak for all patients analyzed were lower in post-nCR (3.63\u00b11.06) compared to those at pre-nCR (4.29\u00b10.89). Using PERCIST1.0, 62% of patients showed stable metabolic disease (SMD), 23% partial metabolic response (PMR), and 15% progressive metabolic disease (PMD). Using RECIST1.1, 85% of patients showed stable disease (SD), 8% partial response (PR), and 7% progressive diseases (PD). A poor insignificant correlation was established between PRT and PERECIST1.0 (r=0.121), whereas no correlation was seen with RECIST1.1. CONCLUSIONS: PERCIST1.0 appears to increase the chance of detecting patients with progressive disease compared to the conventional anatomical-based assessment of RECIST1.1. The integration of these additional radiographic metrics in assessing treatment response to nCR for pancreatic adenocarcinoma may provide a promising strategy to better select patients that are most suitable for therapeutic intensification.",

CBX1 has been implicated in epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression, but its role in human cancers remains largely unknown. Here we show that CBX1 exhibits oncogenic activities in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and indicates poor outcomes. The expression of CBX1 was noticeably increased, at both mRNA and protein levels, in HCC tissues and cell lines, compared with the nontumorous ones. High CBX1 expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, poor tumor differentiation and tumor vascular invasion. Patients with elevated expression of CBX1 were frequently accompanied with unfavorable overall and disease-free survivals in two independent cohorts consisting of 648 HCC cases. The prognostic value of CBX1 was further confirmed by stratified survival analyses. Multivariate cox regression model suggested CBX1 as an independent factor for overall survival (hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f1.735, 95% confident interval: 1.342\u20132.244, P\u202f<\u202f.001). In vitro data demonstrated that CBX1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and migration, whereas the knockdown of CBX1 resulted in the opposite phenotypes. Mechanistically, CBX1 interacted with transcription factor HMGA2 to activate the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway.

     "abstract": "Antiangiogenic treatment (AAT) used in combination with radiation therapy or chemotherapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of several cancer diseases. The vascularity and oxygenation of tumors may be changed significantly by AAT, and consequently, a noninvasive method for monitoring AAT-induced changes in these microenvironmental parameters is needed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). DW-MRI was conducted with a Bruker Biospec 7.05-T scanner using four diffusion weightings and diffusion sensitization gradients in three orthogonal directions. Maps of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated by using a monoexponential diffusion model. Two cervical carcinoma xenograft models (BK-12, HL-16) were treated with bevacizumab, and two pancreatic carcinoma xenograft models (BxPC-3, Panc-1) were treated with sunitinib. Pimonidazole and CD31 were used as markers of hypoxia and blood vessels, respectively, and fraction of hypoxic tissue (HFPim) and microvascular density (MVD) were quantified by analyzing immunohistochemical preparations. MVD decreased significantly after AAT in BK-12, HL-16, and BxPC-3 tumors, and this decrease was sufficiently large to cause a significant increase in HFPim in BK-12 and BxPC-3 tumors. The ADC maps of treated tumors and untreated control tumors were not significantly different in any of these three tumor models, suggesting that the AAT-induced microenvironmental changes were not detectable by DW-MRI. DW-MRI is insensitive to changes in tumor vascularity and oxygenation induced by bevacizumab or sunitinib treatment.",

The exosomal proteomic cargo can often be traced to the cells from which they originated, reflecting the physiological status of these cells. The similarities between cancer exosomes and the tumor cells they originate from exhibit the potential of these vesicles as an invaluable target for liquid biopsies. Exosomes were isolated from the serum of eight osteosarcoma-bearing dogs, five healthy dogs, and five dogs with traumatic fractures. We also characterized exosomes which were collected longitudinally from patients with osteosarcoma prior and 2 weeks after amputation, and eventually upon detection of lung metastasis. Exosomal proteins fraction were analyzed by label-free mass spectrometry proteomics and were validated with immunoblots of selected proteins. Ten exosomal proteins were found that collectively discriminate serum of osteosarcoma patients from serum healthy or fractured dogs with an accuracy of 85%. Additionally, serum from different disease stages could be distinguished with an accuracy of 77% based on exosomal proteomic composition. The most discriminating protein changes for both sample group comparisons were related to complement regulation, suggesting an immune evasion mechanism in early stages of osteosarcoma as well as in advanced disease.",

Of the six cell lines showing high ABT199 ED50 values, four (SUDHL10, OCI-Ly4, SUDHL2, and BJAB) had no or little BCL2 expression, and SUDHL6 also displayed a low BCL2 expression. There was no association between the ED50 value of doxorubicin, JQ1 and bortezomib, and TP53/MYC/BCL2 genetic abnormalities or cell of origin subtype. A synergistic effect in all or the majority of drug combinations was seen in 11 cell lines, while an antagonistic effect in a high proportion of drug combinations was observed in the remaining 5 cell lines including the 3 (SUDHL10, OCI-Ly4, and SUDHL2) with little BCL2 expression, and additionally OCI-Ly18 and RIVA. Extensive Western blot analyses revealed high MCL1 expression in SUDHL10 and OCI-Ly4 but no apparent alterations in other cell lines.

Novel treatment strategies are demanded after conventional treatment failure. This was a prospective, single-arm, and single-center dose escalation study to investigate the safety and preliminary efficacy of apatinib combined with temozolomide in heavily treated advanced melanoma patients. METHODS: Patients were sequentially admitted to four dose-escalating groups of apatinib and temozolomide (three cases in each group) using a traditional 3\u202f+\u202f3 dose escalation design method. RESULTS: Twelve patients were enrolled between December 2016 and August 2017. Most patients with an acral or mucosal primary origin progressed after immunotherapy or targeted therapy. Dose escalation had been completed without dose-limiting toxicity. Common adverse events included hypertension, hand-foot syndrome, proteinuria, neutropenia, nausea, and fatigue. All adverse events were grade 1 or 2, while the maximum tolerated dose was not reached. Up to January 2018, 1 patient achieved partial response, 9 experienced stable disease, and 2 exhibited progressive disease. The objective response rate and disease control rate were 8.3% and 83%, respectively.

The data revealed new candidates for targeted therapies, such as GREB1 and ROR2. We showed that the development of platinum resistance correlated with upregulation of ROR2, whereas GREB1 was downregulated. Moreover, we demonstrated that high levels of ROR2 in platinum-resistant samples were associated with upregulation of Wnt5a, STAT3 and NF-kB levels, suggesting that a crosstalk between the non-canonical Wnt5a-ROR2 and STAT3/NF-kB signaling pathways. Upregulation of ROR2, Wnt5a, STAT3 and NF-kB was further detected in a platinum-resistant cell-line model.

     "abstract": "Although immunotherapy continues to demonstrate efficacy in a variety of refractory cancers, currently, no any immunotherapeutic strategy is clinically used for gastric cancer (GC) except its microsatellite instable subtype. Thus, it is important to identify molecular biomarkers for predicting the responders to GC immunotherapy. TP53 mutations frequently occur in GC and are associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes in GC. We performed a comprehensive characterization of the associations between TP53 mutations and immune activities in GC based on two large-scale GC cancer genomics data. We compared expression and enrichment levels of 787 immune-related genes and 23 immune gene-sets among TP53-mutated GCs, TP53\u2010wildtype GCs, and normal tissue, and explored the correlations between p53-mediated pathways and immune activities in GC. Strikingly, almost all analyzed immune gene-sets were significantly downregulated in enrichment levels in TP53-mutated GCs compared to TP53\u2010wildtype GCs. These less active immune pathways and cell types in TP53-mutated GCs included 15 immune cell types and function, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, regulatory T cells, immune checkpoint, cytokine and cytokine receptor, human leukocyte antigen, pro\u2010inflammatory, and parainflammation. Moreover, we identified a number of p53-mediated pathways and proteins that were significantly associated with immune activities in GC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the TP53 mutation itself could result in the depressed immune activities in GC and other cancer types. We revealed that chromosomal instability was an important mechanism for the depressed tumor immunity in TP53-mutated cancers. Finally, we showed that immune cell infiltration and immune activities were likely positively associated with survival prognosis in GC. Our findings suggest that p53 may play an important role in activating tumor immunity in GC and other cancer types and that the TP53 mutation status could be useful in stratifying cancer patients responsive to a certain immunotherapy.",

However, other factors potentially associated with CIMP have not been robustly examined. This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of the clinical, pathologic, and molecular characteristics that define CIMP tumors. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search of the literature from January 1999 through April 2018 and identified 122 articles, on which comprehensive data abstraction was performed on the clinical, pathologic, molecular, and mutational characteristics of CIMP subgroups, classified based on the extent of DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes assessed using a variety of laboratory methods. Associations of CIMP with outcome parameters were estimated using pooled odds ratio or standardized mean differences using random-effects model. RESULTS: We confirmed prior associations including female sex, older age, right-sided tumor location, poor differentiation, and microsatellite instability. In addition to the recognized association with BRAF mutations, CIMP was also associated with PIK3CA mutations and lack of mutations in KRAS and TP53. Evidence of an activated immune response was seen with high rates of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (but not peritumoral lymphocytes), Crohn-like infiltrates, and infiltration with Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteria. Additionally, CIMP tumors were associated with advance T-stage and presence of perineural and lymphovascular invasion. CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis highlights key features distinguishing CIMP in colorectal cancer, including molecular characteristics of an active immune response. Improved understanding of this unique molecular subtype of colorectal cancer may provide insights into prevention and treatment.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the expression of CSN2 andCD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and mismatch repair (MMR) status in 267 paraffin-embedded specimens using immunohistochemistry in a training cohort. A number of risk factors were used to form nomograms to evaluate survival, and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy. Further validation was performed in an independent cohort of 238cases. RESULTS: Low CSN2 expression and a low number of CD8 + TILs were significantly associated with diminished disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in CRC patients, and patients with MMR-deficient CRC had enhanced DFS and OS. Moreover, the multivariate Cox analysis identified CSN2, CD8 + TILs, and MMR status as independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS. Using these three markers and four clinicopathological risk variables, two nomograms were constructed and validated for predicting DFS and OS (C-index: training cohort, 0.836 (95% CI:0.804\u20130.868) and 0.841 (0.808\u20130.874), respectively; validation cohort, 0.801 (0.760\u2013843) and 0.843 (0.806\u20130.881), respectively).

Blood samples from 28 patients with mCRC and known KRAS mutation status were included. cfDNA was extracted and quantified with droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) measuring Beta-2 Microglobulin. KRAS mutation detection was performed using ddPCR (Bio-Rad) and next-generation sequencing (NGS, Ion Torrent PGM). Comparing KRAS mutation status in plasma and tissue revealed concordance rates of 79% and 89% for NGS and ddPCR. Strong correlation between the methods was observed. Most KRAS mutations were also detectable in 10-fold diluted samples using the ddPCR. We find that for detection of KRAS mutations in ctDNA ddPCR was superior to NGS both in analysis success rate and concordance to tissue.

Identification of distinct gene expressions between primary CRC and peritoneal seeding metastasis is to predict the metastatic potential of primary human CRC. Three pairs of primary CRC (SNU-2335A, SNU-2404A, and SNU-2414A) and corresponding peritoneal seeding (SNU-2335D, SNU-2404B, and SNU-2414B) cell lines were established to determine the different gene expressions and resulting aberrated signaling pathways in peritoneal metastasis tumor using whole exome sequencing and microarray. Whole exome sequencing detected that mutation in CYP2A7 was exclusively shared in peritoneal seeding cell lines. Microarray identified that there were five upregulated genes (CNN3, SORBS1, BST2, EPSTI1, and KLHL5) and two downregulated genes (TRY6 and STYL5) in the peritoneal metastatic cell lines. CNN3 expression was highly augmented in both mRNA and protein levels in peritoneal metastasis cells. Knockdown of Calponin 3 resulted in augmented level of E-cadherin in peritoneal metastasis cells, and migration and invasiveness decreased accordingly. We suggest that CNN3 takes part in cell projection and movement, and the detection and distribution of CNN3 may render prognostic information for predicting peritoneal seeding metastasis from primary colorectal cancer.",

Log-rank test and Cox model were used to evaluate the survival; and Harrell's C-index was used to compare concordance of Cox models. Our results indicated 7 miRNAs aberrantly expressed in HC. Three of these candidate miRNAs (miRNA-4415, miRNA-200a, and miRNA-30b) were selected for further qRT-PCR validation and all of them were frequently found upregulated in HC tumors; with miR-4451 being the most differentially expressed.

Finally, significantly higher expression of miR-4451 in tumors compared to in fresh adjacent normal tissues indicates an oncogenic role of miR-4451 in this tumor. Upregulated miR-4451 in HC samples were frequently found and is significantly associated with advanced stage and poor survival of HC, which may indicate an association of this miRNA with the carcinogenesis process in this tumor site; and they could serve as a prognostic biomarker as well as help develop potential new targets for therapy.",

METHODS: Nude mice injected with U87MG tumor cells were longitudinally monitored for the development of orthotopic GBMs up to 15 days and observed for changes in sO2 upon administration of combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P, 30 mg/kg), an FDA approved VDA for treating solid tumors. We employed a newly-developed non-negative constrained approach for combined MSOT image reconstruction and unmixing in order to quantitatively map sO2 in whole mouse brains. RESULTS: Upon longitudinal monitoring, tumors could be detected in mouse brains using single-wavelength data as early as 6 days post tumor cell inoculation. Fifteen days post-inoculation, tumors had higher sO2 of 63 \u00b1 11% (n = 5, P < .05) against 48 \u00b1 7% in the corresponding contralateral brain, indicating their hyperoxic status. In a different set of animals, 42 days post-inoculation, tumors had lower sO2 of 42 \u00b1 5% against 49 \u00b1 4% (n = 3, P < .05) in the contralateral side, indicating their hypoxic status. Upon CA4P administration, sO2 in 15 days post-inoculation tumors dropped from 61 \u00b1 9% to 36 \u00b1 1% (n = 4, P < .01) within one hour, then reverted to pre CA4P treatment values (63 \u00b1 6%) and remained constant until the last observation time point of 6 hours.

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Incurable metastatic breast disease presents a major clinical challenge and is the main cause of breast cancer-related death. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical early promoter of metastasis. In the present study, we identified a novel role for the inhibitor of DNA binding 2 (Id2), a member of the basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix protein family, during the EMT of breast cancer. Expression of Id2 was positively correlated with Notch3 in breast cancer cells. Low expression of Id2 and Notch3 was associated with worse distant metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. The present study revealed that Id2 activated Notch3 expression by blocking E2A binding to an E-box motif in the Notch3 promoter. The Id2-mediated up-regulation of Notch3 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels resulted in an attenuated EMT, which was associated with reduced motility and matrix invasion of ER-positive and -negative human breast cancer cells and the emergence of E-cadherin expression and reduction in the mesenchymal marker vimentin in triple-negative breast cancer cells. In summary, our findings identified Id2 as a suppressor of the EMT and positive transcriptional regulator of Notch3 in breast cancer. Id2 and Notch3 may serve as novel prognostic markers in a subpopulation of ER-positive breast cancer patients.",

Although understanding key mechanisms of tumor progression in SRCCs is critical for precise treatment, a comprehensive view of genomic alterations is lacking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed whole-exome sequencing of tumors and matched normal blood as well as RNA sequencing of tumors and matched normal colonic tissues from five patients with SRCC. RESULTS: We identified major somatic alterations and characterized transcriptional changes at the gene and pathway level. Based on high-throughput sequencing, the pattern of mutations and copy number variations was overall similar to that of COAD. Transcriptome analysis revealed that major transcription factors, such as SRF, HNF4A, ZEB1, and RUNX1, with potential regulatory roles in key pathways, including focal adhesion, the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and the MAPK signaling pathway, may play a role in the tumorigenesis of SRCC. Furthermore, significantly upregulated genes in SRCCs were enriched for epithelial-mesenchymal transition genes, and accumulation of mucin in intracytoplasm was associated with the overexpression of MUC2. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the molecular basis of colorectal SRCC exhibits key differences from that of consensus COAD.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by the institutional review board and all patients provided written informed consent. 447 breast cancer patients, totally 455 lesions were included in our study. The size and THC of breast lesions were measured by conventional ultrasound (US) and US-guided Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT) 1\u20132\u202fdays before surgery. Clinical and pathology information of patients was collected. RESULT: The average THC values of ER- or PR- lesions were significantly higher than the positive ones (P\u202f=\u202f.005 and P\u202f=\u202f.01,respectively); The average THC values of axillar LN+ or LVI+ were higher than the negative ones (P\u202f=\u202f.042 and P\u202f=\u202f.043, respectively).

     "abstract": "The prognosis of pancreatic cancer (PC) remains pessimistic because of the difficulty in early diagnosis as well as the little advance in chemotherapy. Although being the first-line chemotherapy drug for PC at present, gemcitabine still has some disadvantages, such as low drug sensitivity and significant side effects. Thus, how to further improve the sensitivity of PC cells to gemcitabine is still a difficult subject in the field of pancreatic cancer-treatment. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is closely related to poor outcome in many malignant tumors and its high expression is linked to chemoresistance in PC. As a downstream gene activated by PI3K/Akt signal pathway, we assumed that the targeted depletion of Plk1 could contribute to the chemosensitization induced by synergistic drug interaction of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 together with gemcitabine. To analyze effect of Plk1 in chemotherapy, we constructed two recombinant adenoviral vectors which carry enhanced green fluorescent protein (rAd-EGFP) and Plk1-shRNA (rAd-shPlk1), respectively. Both inhibition of PI3K/Akt signal pathway through PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and targeted depletion of Plk1 via recombinant adenoviral shRNA can cause chemosensitization, and the targeted depletion of Plk1 can enhance the chemosensitization of LY294002. Thus, the gene therapy like targeted depletion of Plk1 may create new perspectives for chemosensitization of PC.",

Additionally, mild hyperthermia (37\u00b0C-45\u00b0C) has previously shown a synergistic anticancer effect when used with standard-of-care chemotherapeutics such as gemcitabine and Abraxane. However, RF hyperthermia treatment schedules remain unoptimized, and the mechanisms of action of hyperthermia and how they change when treating various tumor phenotypes are poorly understood. Therefore, pretreatment screening of tumor phenotypes to identify key tumors that are predicted to respond more favorably to hyperthermia will provide useful mechanistic data and may improve therapeutic outcomes. Herein, we identify key biophysical tumor characteristics in order to predict the outcome of combinational RF and chemotherapy treatment. We demonstrate that ultrasound imaging using Doppler mode can be utilized to predict the response of combinational RF and chemotherapeutic therapy in a murine 4T1 breast cancer model.",

     "abstract": "Bone metastasis is a complication of advanced breast and prostate cancer. Tumor-secreted Dickkopf homolog 1 (DKK1), an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signaling and osteoblast differentiation, was proposed to regulate the osteoblastic response to metastatic cancer in bone. The objectives of this study were to compare DKK1 expression with the in vivo osteoblastic response in a panel of breast and prostate cancer cell lines, and to discover mechanisms that regulate cancer DKK1 expression. DKK1 expression was highest in MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cells that produce osteolytic lesions, and hence a suppressed osteoblastic response, in animal models of bone metastasis. LnCaP, C4-2B, LuCaP23.1, T47D, ZR-75-1, MCF-7, ARCaP and ARCaPM cancer cells that generate osteoblastic, mixed or no bone lesions had the lowest DKK1 expression. The cell lines with negligible expression, LnCaP, C4-2B and T47D, exhibited methylation of the DKK1 promoter. Canonical Wnt signaling activity was then determined and found in all cell lines tested, even in the MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cell lines despite sizeable amounts of DKK1 protein expression expected to block canonical Wnt signaling. A mechanism of DKK1 resistance in the osteolytic cell lines was investigated and determined to be at least partially due to down-regulation of the DKK1 receptors Kremen1 and Kremen2 in the MDA-MB-231 and PC3 cell lines. Combined DKK1 and Kremen expression in cancer cells may serve as predictive markers of the osteoblastic response of breast and prostate cancer bone metastasis.",

Most techniques for analysis of miRNAs require a large plasma volume to purify a sufficient RNA yield followed by complicated downstream processing.

FirePlex assay was directly applied to 20 \u03bcl plasma of 56 lung cancer patients and 28 cancer free controls for quantifying 11 lung tumor\u2013associated miRNAs. FirePlex assay is easier, less expensive and time-consuming for quantification of plasma miRNAs compared with conventional reverse transcription PCR with an equivalent analytic performance. From the lung tumor\u2013associated miRNAs, a prediction model based on two miRNAs (miRs-205-5p and -210-3p) was developed, producing 78.6% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity for identifying lung cancer. The diagnostic value was independent of stage of lung tumor, and patients\u2019 age and sex (all P > 0.05). Furthermore, based on the same two miRNAs, additional prediction models were developed with 75.0% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity for diagnosis of lung squamous cell carcinoma, and 82.2% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity for lung adenocarcinoma. The direct plasma assay can improve the efficacy of miRNA assessment in a small plasma volume by reducing multiple procedure-associated analytical variables.

By contrast, allograft transplantation could activate the immune system and induce a strong allogenic response. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of allogenic skin transplantation in the inhibition of tumor growth through the activation of allogenic immune response. METHODS: Full-thickness skin transplantation was performed from C57BL/6 (H-2b) donors to BALB/c (H-2d) recipients that were receiving subcutaneous injection of isogenic CT26 colon cancer cells (2\u202f\u00d7\u202f106 cells) at the same time. The tumor size and pathological changes, cell populations and cytokine profiles were evaluated at day 14 post-transplantation. RESULTS: The results showed that as compared to non-transplant group, the allogenic immune response in the skin-grafting group inhibited the growth of tumors, which was significantly associated with increased numbers of intra-tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, increased populations of CD11c+MHC-classII+CD86+ DCs, CD3+CD4+ T cells, CD3+CD8+ T cells, and CD19+ B cells, as well as decreased percentage of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells in the spleens. In addition, the levels of serum IgM and IgG, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 were significantly higher within the tumor in skin transplant groups than that in non-transplant group. CONCLUSIONS: Allogenic skin transplantation suppresses the tumor growth through activating the allogenic immune response, and it may provide a new immunotherapy option for the clinical refractory tumor treatment.",

The potential anti-cancer effect of Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S), has not been widely recognized. It intrigued broad interest to explore the clinical benefits of cancer therapy, with the current understanding of molecular mechanisms of H2S which remains very limited. In this study, we identify that H2S is an effective inhibitor of MGAT5, leading to reduce the expression of exclusively abnormal glycoprotein processes in gastric carcinoma. H2S specifically dissociation of karyopherin subunit alpha-2 (KPNA2) with Jun proto-oncogene (c-Jun) interaction, and blocking c-Jun nuclear translocation, and downregulation of MGAT5 expression at the level of gene and protein. Consequently, H2S impairs growth and metastasis in gastric carcinoma by targeting inhibits MGAT5 activity. In an animal tumor model study, H2S is well tolerated, inhibits gastric carcinoma growth and metastasis. Our preclinical work therefore supports that H2S acts as a novel inhibitor of MGAT5 that block tumorigenesis in gastric carcinoma. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that H2S can effective targeting inhibits MGAT5 activity, and demonstrates promising antitumor efficacy. These findings gain mechanistic insights into the anti-cancer capacity of H2S and may provide useful information for the clinical explorations of H2S in cancer treatment.",

However, tumor cells acquire resistance to this therapy by gaining ability to survive and proliferate under hypoxia induced by antiangiogenic therapy. Combining antiangiogenic therapy with hypoxia-activated prodrugs can overcome this limitation. Here, we have tested the combination of antiangiogenic drug sunitinib in combination with hypoxia-activated prodrug evofosfamide in neuroblastoma. In vitro, neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2) was 40-folds sensitive to evofosfamide under hypoxia compared to normoxia. In IV metastatic model, evofosfamide significantly increased mice survival compared to the vehicle (P=.02). In SK-N-BE(2) subcutaneous xenograft model, we tested two different treatment regimens using 30 mg/kg sunitinib and 50 mg/kg evofosfamide. Here, sunitinib therapy when started along with evofosfamide treatment showed higher efficacy compared to single agents in subcutaneous SK-N-BE(2) xenograft model, whereas sunitinib when started 7 days after evofosfamide treatment did not have any advantage compared to treatment with either single agent. Immunofluorescence of tumor sections revealed higher number of apoptotic cells and hypoxic areas compared to either single agent when both treatments were started together. Treatment with 80 mg/kg sunitinib with 50 mg/kg evofosfamide was significantly superior to single agents in both xenograft and metastatic models. This study confirms the preclinical efficacy of sunitinib and evofosfamide in murine models of aggressive neuroblastoma.

Association of AR with cancer stem cell (CSC) markers in BCa is unknown. Aim of the present study was to evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of AR, CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 in a cohort of Pakistani patients diagnosed with invasive BCa and to correlate the expression with 5- year disease free survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated immunohistochemical expression AR, CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 in formalin fixed paraffin embedded archival blocks of 166 cases of primary invasive BCa (stage I-III) and correlated the expression with clinicopathological variables and outcome using univariable and multivariable analysis. Survival data was computed by Kaplan Meier curves. RESULTS: Expression of AR was observed in 62.7% tumors whereas CD44, CD24 and ALDH1 were expressed in 61.4%, 44% and 30.1% tumors, respectively. AR expression was significantly associated with T1-T2 tumors, lower grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor expression (P < .05) and remained an independent prognostic indicator in multivariable analysis (adjusted HR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13\u20130.81; P = .016). Significant association was observed between concordant expression of AR and CD24 (P = .001) with a favorable impact on survival (P = .007) whereas expression of CSC phenotypes (CD44+, CD44+/CD24\u2212 and ALDH1+) did not correlate with adverse outcome (P > .05). However, AR expression retained the association with better prognosis even in patients whose tumors exhibited a CSC phenotype.

     "abstract": "p53 is a transcription factor that regulates expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis. TP53 harbors mutations that inactivate its transcriptional activity in roughly 30% of breast cancers, and these tumors are much more likely to undergo a pathological complete response to chemotherapy. Thus, the gene expression program activated by wild-type p53 contributes to a poor response. We used an in vivo genetic model system to comprehensively define the p53- and p21-dependent genes and pathways modulated in tumors following doxorubicin treatment. We identified genes differentially expressed in spontaneous mammary tumors harvested from treated MMTV-Wnt1 mice that respond poorly (Trp53+/+) or favorably (Trp53-null) and those that lack the critical senescence/arrest p53 target gene Cdkn1a. Trp53 wild-type tumors differentially expressed nearly 10-fold more genes than Trp53-null tumors after treatment. Pathway analyses showed that genes involved in cell cycle, senescence, and inflammation were enriched in treated Trp53 wild-type tumors; however, no genes/pathways were identified that adequately explain the superior cell death/tumor regression observed in Trp53-null tumors. Cdkn1a-null tumors that retained arrest capacity (responded poorly) and those that proliferated (responded well) after treatment had remarkably different gene regulation. For instance, Cdkn1a-null tumors that arrested upregulated Cdkn2a (p16), suggesting an alternative, p21-independent route to arrest. Live animal imaging of longitudinal gene expression of a senescence/inflammation gene reporter in Trp53+/+ tumors showed induction during and after chemotherapy treatment, while tumors were arrested, but expression rapidly diminished immediately upon relapse.",

MR parameters were obtained from corresponding sample locations, and histograms of normalized MR parameters within the T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery lesion were analyzed in order to evaluate differences between subgroups. For tissue samples, higher tumor scores were related to increased normalized apparent diffusion coefficient (nADC), lower fractional anisotropy (nFA), lower cerebral blood volume (nCBV), higher choline (nCho), and lower N-acetylaspartate (nNAA). Within the T2 lesion, higher tumor grade was associated with higher nADC, lower nFA, and higher Cho to NAA index.

AR was more highly expressed in luminal A and B than HER2-positive and triple negative primary tumors. A similar distribution was found in metastases, and the concordance of AR expression between primary tumors and metastases was greater than 60%. No association between sampling time and AR expression was observed. We found a good concordance of AR expression between primary tumor and metastasis, but the variability remains high between the two types of specimens, regardless of the variation in sampling time.

Especially procedure-related morbidity can be substantial, particularly in elderly patients. Hence, reliable imaging modalities enabling pretherapeutic prediction of tumor grade, growth kinetic, realistic prognosis, and\u2014as a consequence\u2014necessity of surgery are of great value. In this context, a promising diagnostic approach is advanced analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data. Therefore, our study investigated whether histogram profiling of routinely acquired postcontrast T1-weighted images is capable of separating low-grade from high-grade lesions and whether histogram parameters reflect Ki-67 expression in meningiomas. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pretreatment T1-weighted postcontrast volumes of 44 meningioma patients were used for signal intensity histogram profiling. WHO grade, tumor volume, and Ki-67 expression were evaluated. Comparative and correlative statistics investigating the association between histogram profile parameters and neuropathology were performed. RESULTS: None of the investigated histogram parameters revealed significant differences between low-grade and high-grade meningiomas. However, significant correlations were identified between Ki-67 and the histogram parameters skewness and entropy as well as between entropy and tumor volume. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to previously reported findings, pretherapeutic postcontrast T1-weighted images can be used to predict growth kinetics in meningiomas if whole tumor histogram analysis is employed. However, no differences between distinct WHO grades were identifiable in out cohort. As a consequence, histogram analysis of postcontrast T1-weighted images is a promising approach to obtain quantitative in vivo biomarkers reflecting the proliferative potential in meningiomas.",

We investigated the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a true population-based cohort of patients with stage II CC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 573 patients were included. Tumor blocks representing the deepest invasive part of the primary tumor were used for analysis. CD3+ and CD8+ TILs at the invasive front were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on whole tumor sections. The invasive area was manually outlined, and Visiopharm Integrator System software was used for quantification. Data were dichotomized for comparison with clinical data. The prognostic value was investigated in Cox proportional-hazard models for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Low CD3+ or CD8+ TILs were significantly associated with poor RFS and OS (P\u202f=\u202f.0021 and P\u202f\u2264\u202f.0009, respectively, log-rank test).

     "abstract": "Anthracyclines, such as doxorubicin, are used as first-line chemotherapeutics, usually in combination therapies, for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. While these drugs have been successful therapeutic options, their use is limited due to serious drug related toxicities and acquired tumor resistance. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms that mediate doxorubicin's cytotoxic effect will lead to the identification of novel more efficacious combination therapies and allow for reduced doses of doxorubicin to be administered while maintaining efficacy. In our study, we demonstrate that activating transcription factor (ATF) 3 expression was upregulated by doxorubicin treatment in a representative panel of human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and MDA-MB-231. We have also shown that doxorubicin treatment can induce ATF3 expression in ex vivo human breast and ovarian tumor samples. The upregulation of ATF3 in the cell lines was regulated by multiple cellular mechanisms including the activation of JNK and ATM signaling pathways. Importantly, loss of ATF3 expression resulted in reduced sensitivity to doxorubicin treatment in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Through a 1200 FDA-approved compound library screen, we identified a number of agents whose cytotoxicity is dependent on ATF3 expression that also enhanced doxorubicin induced cytotoxicity. For example, the combination of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat or the nucleoside analogue trifluridine could synergistically enhance doxorubicin cytotoxicity in the MCF7 cell line. Synergy in cell lines with the combination of ATF3 inducers and patients with elevated basal levels of ATF3 shows enhanced response to chemotherapy. Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for ATF3 in mediating doxorubicin cytotoxicity and provide rationale for the combination of ATF3-inducing agents with doxorubicin as a novel therapeutic approach.",

METHODS: LA-SCCL patients receiving definitive radiotherapy and baseline tumor marker measurement were eligible for this retrospective study. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine independent factors associated with various survival indexes and a nomogram was created to estimate the 5-year OS probability for individual patient. The identified prognostic factors were recruited into a recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) for OS to stratify patients with distinct outcome. RESULTS: A total of 224 patients were eligible for analysis. Increased cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) was independently associated with inferior OS, progression free survival (PFS) and a borderline decreased local-regional progression free survival (LRPFS). Elevated carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA) served as an unfavorable determinant for OS and increased neuron-specific enolase (NSE) was predictive of poor distant metastasis free survival (DMFS). A nomogram integrating KPS, TNM stage, CEA and CYFRA 21-1 was created, resulting in a c-index of 0.62. RPA identified 4 prognostic classifications, with median OS of 27.6, 19.9, 17.3 and 10.9\u202fmonths for low, intermediate, high and very-high risk groups, respectively.

     "abstract": "The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lobaplatin as a single agent chemotherapy concurrent with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in Asian population with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remains unclear. From June 2016 to December 2017, 17 patients diagnosed with stage III-IVb NPC from an Asian population were prospectively enrolled. Patients were administered lobaplatin with 25-50\u202fmg/m2 escalation of dosage on day 1. Every 21\u202fdays (days 1, 22, and 43) during radiotherapy, cycles were repeated. We administered radiotherapy as 2.12-2.27 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions each week for 6 to 7 weeks. The evaluation of lobaplatin-related toxic effects was based on the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. During the weekly treatment period, complete blood counts and biochemistry were performed. Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were determined by the following events during any cycle in which lobaplatin was administered. Each dose group consisted of at least three cases. We proceeded to the subsequent dose group in the absence of DLT with a dose increment of 5 mg/m2 until DLT occurred. Periods from 1 week prior to the chemotherapy initiation to 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy were defined as DLT observation periods. MTD was determined by the dose that was immediately below the dose that produced DLT. After analysis, DLT occurred in three patients, including a group with two of three patients in 45 mg/m2 lobaplatin and another group with one of five patients in 40 mg/m2 lobaplatin. No grade 3-4 toxicity was observed in patients treated with lobaplatin <40 mg/m2. The tumor response rate at 12\u202fweeks after treatment was 100%. In summary, lobaplatin concurrent with IMRT was active in stage III-IVb NPC, and the MTD for the lobaplatin as single-agent chemotherapy was 40 mg/m2 when combined with IMRT in an Asian population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03188497.",

In prostate cancer (PC), the down-regulation is associated with disease recurrence. Nonetheless, how BChE is expressed in PC and its impact on PC remain unclear. We report here the biphasic changes of BChE expression in PC. In vitro, BChE expression was decreased in more tumorigenic PC stem-like cells (PCSLCs), DU145, and PC3 cells compared to less tumorigenic non-stem PCs and LNCaP cells. On the other hand, BChE was expressed at a higher level in LNCaP cells than immortalized but non-tumorigenic prostate epithelial BPH-1 cells. In vivo, BChE expression was up-regulated in DU145 xenografts compared to LNCaP xenografts; DU145 cell-derived lung metastases displayed comparable levels of BChE as subcutaneous tumors. Furthermore, LNCaP xenografts produced in castrated mice exhibited a significant increase of BChE expression compared to xenografts generated in intact mice. In patients, BChE expression was down-regulated in PCs (n = 340) compared to prostate tissues (n = 86). In two independent PC populations MSKCC (n = 130) and TCGA Provisional (n = 490), BChE mRNA levels were reduced from World Health Organization grade group 1 (WHOGG 1) PCs to WHOGG 3 PCs, followed by a significant increase in WHOGG 5 PCs. The up-regulation was associated with a reduction in disease-free survival (P = .008). Collectively, we demonstrated for the first time a biphasic alteration of BChE, its down-regulation at early stage of PC and its up-regulation at advanced PC.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Breast cancer is now recognized as a clinically heterogeneous disease with a wide spectrum of epidemiological and clinicopathologic features. We aimed to evaluate whether epidemiological and clinicopathologic features are associated with the histological tumor grade of breast carcinomas in Western China. METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from the Western China Clinical Cooperation Group and assessed associations between clinicopathologic factors and histological tumor grade in 8619 female breast cancer patients. Patients were divided into two groups: Group I (tumor grade I/II) and Group II (tumor grade III). Univariable analysis and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyze the relationships between clinicopathologic factors and tumor grade. RESULTS: Patients presenting with positive axillary lymph nodes, large tumor size (>2\u202fcm), lymphovascular invasion, hormone receptor negativity, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) positivity, and triple negativity tended to have an increased risk of a high tumor grade. However, the number of pregnancies or births was inversely correlated with the risk of a high tumor grade. In addition, patients presenting with grade III tumors were more likely to receive aggressive treatment, such as adjuvant chemotherapy, anti\u2013HER-2 therapy, and level III axillary lymph node dissection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested that several clinicopathologic factors were associated with high tumor grade of breast cancer patients in Western China.",

OBJECTIVE: To find potential prognostic protein biomarkers in colorectal cancer, using the proximity extension assays. METHODS: A panel of 92 oncology-related proteins was analyzed with proximity extension assays, in plasma from a cohort of 261 colorectal cancer patients with stage II-IV. The survival analyses were corrected for disease stage and age, and the recurrence analyses were corrected for disease stage. The significance threshold was adjusted for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The plasma proteins expression levels had a greater prognostic relevance in disease stage III colorectal cancer than in disease stage II, and for overall survival than for time to recurrence. Osteoprotegerin was the only biomarker candidate in the protein panel that had a statistical significant association with overall survival (P = .00029). None of the proteins were statistically significantly associated with time to recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Of the 92 analyzed plasma proteins, osteoprotegerin showed the strongest prognostic impact in patients with colorectal cancer, and therefore osteoprotegerin is a potential predictive marker, and it also could be a target for treatments.",

This is especially critical in patients with colorectal cancer, which requires a delicate combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy in order to achieve optimal outcome. In this study, we investigated the potential of phosphatidylserine-recognizing peptide 1 (PSP1) as an apoptosis-targeting probe, which identifies phosphatidylserine on cell surfaces. We first screened colon cancer cell lines for their sensitivity to radiation and selected two cell lines: HCT116 and HT29. Cell binding assay using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and optical imaging showed that HCT116 cells had better binding to PSP1 than HT29 cells. Thus, mouse xenograft model using HCT116 cells was generated and was topically irradiated with either single or fractionated dose of radiation followed by systemic administration of PSP1 for subsequent molecular optical imaging. We confirmed that the PSP1 probe was selectively bound to apoptosis-induced tumor in a radiation dose-dependent manner. We also observed that fractionated radiation regimen, which is recently being used in clinical situation, was more effective in inducing tumor apoptosis than corresponding single-dose radiation treatment. We then evaluated the correlation between tumor targeting of PSP1 and suppression effect of tumor development and found that tumor volume and fluorescence intensity were correlated before (correlation coefficient r2 = 0.534) and after (r2 = 0.848) radiation therapy. Our study shows that PSP1 peptide is an efficient index probe for deciding \u201cgo or no-go\u201d for radiation therapy in colorectal cancer.",

Exploration of drug resistance mechanisms and identification of new therapeutics that overcome the drug resistance can improve patient prognosis. Following a quantitative combination screen of 6060 approved drugs and bioactive compounds in a cisplatin-resistant A2780-cis ovarian cancer cell line, 38 active compounds with IC50s under 1 \u03bcM suppressed the growth of cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer cells. Among these confirmed compounds, CUDC-101, OSU-03012, oligomycin A, VE-821, or Torin2 in a combination with cisplatin restored cisplatin's apoptotic response in the A2780-cis cells, while SR-3306, GSK-923295, SNX-5422, AT-13387, and PF-05212384 directly suppressed the growth of A2780-cis cells. One of the mechanisms for overcoming cisplatin resistance in these cells is mediated by the inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), though not all the EGFR inhibitors are equally active. The increased levels of total EGFR and phosphorylated-EGFR (p-EGFR) in the A2780-cis cells were reduced after the combined treatment of cisplatin with EGFR inhibitors. In addition, a knockdown of EGFR mRNA reduced cisplatin resistance in the A2780-cis cells. Therefore, the top active compounds identified in this work can be studied further as potential treatments for cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer. The quantitative combinational screening approach is a useful method for identifying effective compounds and drug combinations against drug-resistant cancer cells.",

Here, we review the reasons underlying the limitations of DC-based immunotherapy for solid tumors and ask what can be done to improve immune cell-based cancer therapies. Several reports show that, rather than a lack of immune induction, the limited efficacy of DC-based immunotherapy in cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) likely results from inhibition of immune responses by tumor-secreted TGF-\u03b2 and an increase in the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells in and around the solid tumor. Indeed, unlike DC therapy for solid tumors, cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses induced by DC therapy inhibit tumor recurrence after surgery; CTL responses also limit tumor metastasis induced by additional tumor-challenge in RCC tumor-bearing mice. Here, we discuss the mechanisms underlying the poor efficacy of DC-based therapy for solid tumors and stress the need for new and improved DC immunotherapies and/or combination therapies with killer cells to treat resistant solid tumors.",

     "abstract": "Medical oncology is in need of a mathematical modeling toolkit that can leverage clinically-available measurements to optimize treatment selection and schedules for patients. Just as the therapeutic choice has been optimized to match tumor genetics, the delivery of those therapeutics should be optimized based on patient-specific pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties. Under the current approach to treatment response planning and assessment, there does not exist an efficient method to consolidate biomarker changes into a holistic understanding of treatment response. While the majority of research on chemotherapies focus on cellular and genetic mechanisms of resistance, there are numerous patient-specific and tumor-specific measures that contribute to treatment response. New approaches that consolidate multimodal information into actionable data are needed. Mathematical modeling offers a solution to this problem. In this perspective, we first focus on the particular case of breast cancer to highlight how mathematical models have shaped the current approaches to treatment. Then we compare chemotherapy to radiation therapy. Finally, we identify opportunities to improve chemotherapy treatments using the model of radiation therapy. We posit that mathematical models can improve the application of anticancer therapeutics in the era of precision medicine. By highlighting a number of historical examples of the contributions of mathematical models to cancer therapy, we hope that this contribution serves to engage investigators who may not have previously considered how mathematical modeling can provide real insights into breast cancer therapy.",

One of the more frequent and serious treatment-induced toxicities is mucositis and particularly oral mucositis (OM) described as inflammation, atrophy and breakdown of the mucosa or lining of the oral cavity. The sequelae of oral mucositis (OM), which include pain, odynodysphagia, dysgeusia, decreased oral intake and systemic infection, frequently require treatment delays, interruptions and discontinuations that not only negatively impact quality of life but also tumor control and survivorship. One potential strategy to reduce or prevent the development of mucositis, for which no effective therapies exist only best supportive empirical care measures, is the administration of agents referred to as radioprotectors and/or chemoprotectors, which are intended to differentially protect normal but not malignant tissue from cytotoxicity. This limited-scope review briefly summarizes the incidence, pathogenesis, symptoms and impact on patients of OM as well as the background and mechanisms of four clinical stage radioprotectors/chemoprotectors, amifostine, palifermin, GC4419 and RRx-001, with the proven or theoretical potential to minimize the development of mucositis particularly in the treatment of head and neck cancers.",

The majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease when surgery, the best curative option, is no longer feasible. Thus, the prognosis of lung cancer remains poor and heterogeneous and new biomarkers are needed. As the immune system plays a pivotal role in cancer, the study of tumor microenvironment, with regard to the immune component, may provide valuable information for a better comprehension of the pathogenesis and progression of the disease. Through a detailed and critical evaluation of the most recent publications on this topic, we provide evidences of the prognostic and predictive significance of immune markers in tumor and in peripheral blood of lung cancer patients: from the landscape of immune cells (macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and natural killer) and their cytokines, to the analysis of immune-checkpoints (PD-L1 and CTLA4), up to the genetic and epigenetic regulation of the immune response (immune gene signatures and miRNA). We also argue about the lights and shadows related to immune marker use in clinical practice, emphasizing on one hand the importance of their assessment in the choice of therapeutic treatment, on the other, the difficulty in their determination and reproducibility of literature data.

We examined the effect of VEGF-C on achievement of complete remission (CR) in adult de novo AML and immune cell population profiles according to VEGF-C mRNA expression. In comparison of VEGF-C expression between the no-CR and CR groups, the CR group showed a trend toward higher levels of plasma VEGF-C (P = .088), whereas mRNA expression of VEGF-C was downregulated (P = .008). Next, patients with continuous data for VEGF-C were divided into two groups (low vs. high) by a ROC curve analysis. The low- versus high-level groups for plasma VEGF-C (RR of 0.20, P = .030), mRNA expression of VEGF-C (RR of 18.75, P = .003), and the ratio of plasma level to mRNA expression (RR of 0.05, P = .007) were potential predictors of CR on univariate analysis. After adjusting for potential clinical factors including genetic group, multivariate analyses revealed that high VEGF-C mRNA expression was an independent risk factor for failure of induction chemotherapy. Furthermore, patients with high VEGF-C mRNA expression had a lower frequency of NKT and CD8+ cells and showed a trend for a lower frequency of NK cells. These results suggest that interruption of VEGF-C signaling might be a potential therapeutic target for antileukemic treatment in AML patients.",

In this study, we investigated the expression and role of DDR1 in human gastric cancer metastasis. Proliferation, migration, invasion, and tube formation assays were conducted in DDR1-expressing MKN74 gastric cancer cells and corresponding DDR1-silenced cells. The effects of DDR1 on tumor growth and metastasis were examined in orthotopically implanted and experimental liver metastasis models in nude mice. The expression of DDR1 in surgical specimens was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. DDR1 was expressed in human gastric cancer cell lines, and its expression in human gastric tumors was associated with poor prognosis. Among seven gastric cancer cell lines, MKN74 expressed the highest levels of DDR1. DDR1-silenced MKN74 cells showed unaltered proliferation activity. In contrast, migration, invasion, and tube formation were significantly reduced. When examined in an orthotopic nude mouse model, DDR1-silenced implanted tumors significantly reduced angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, thereby leading to reductions in lymph node metastasis and liver metastasis. In a model of experimental liver metastasis, DDR1-silenced cells almost completely inhibited liver colonization and metastasis. DDR1 deficiency led to reduced expression of the genes encoding vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF-C, and platelet-derived growth factor-B. These results suggest that DDR1 is involved in gastric cancer tumor progression and that silencing of DDR1 inhibits multiple steps of the gastric cancer metastasis process.",

But whether high-density CGI methylation of GATA5 is associated with the clinical course of CCA patients has not been clarified. Herein, we observed reduced expression of GATA5 in CCA tissues compared with noncancerous tissues.

Furthermore, GATA5 expression was downregulated after treatment with IL-6 in human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells. Upregulated GATA5 inhibited CCA cell growth and metastasis. Mechanistically, GATA5 suppressed CCA cell growth and metastasis via Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Specific \u03b2-catenin inhibitor or siRNA abolished the discrepancy of the proliferation and metastasis capacity between GATA5-overexpression CCA cells and their control cells, which further confirmed that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin was required in GATA5-inhibited CCA cell growth and metastasis.",

SGC-7901-GFP human gastric cancer cells were tested for DLL4 expression by rosette formation test and immunofluorescence, and then were treated with anti-DLL4 antibody N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-ananyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT, a type of GSI), or a combination of anti-DLL4 antibody and DAPT. The effects of in vitro treatments on cell apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell invasion were analyzed. For in vivo study, an orthotopic mouse model of gastric cancer was established with green fluorescence expressing SGC-7901. Ultrasound targeted microbubble destruction was used to treat tumor-bearing mice with anti-DLL4 antibody conjugated microbubbles, DAPT, and a combination of the two. Real-time fluorescence imaging was performed to assess tumor cell inhibition in each group. Following in vivo treatments, apoptosis of tumor cells and the expression of apoptosis-related genes BAX, Bcl-2, and P53 were detected by TUNEL and immunohistochemical staining. In vivo combined treatment of anti-DLL4 and DAPT led to a higher rate of cell apoptosis and greater inhibition of cell invasion than that observed with DAPT treatment alone. DAPT and anti-DLL4 combination therapy resulted in decreased cell distribution at G1 phase and increased cell distribution at S phase, compared to the untreated control group (P < .01). In vivo combined therapy with anti-DLL4 and DAPT significantly increased tumor growth inhibition and tumor cell apoptosis when compared to DAPT therapy alone (P < .05). In addition, combined treatment significantly increased expression of BAX and P53 and reduced Bcl-2 expression (P < .05). Conversely, treatment with DAPT alone only increased expression of BAX and P53 (P < .05), suggesting that the reduction of Bcl-2 expression may play an important role in the synergetic antitumor and proapoptosis effects of the combined treatment.

Interleukin (IL)-8, a proinflammatory chemokine with tumorigenic and proangiogenic effects, promotes lung cancer cells growth and migration and contributes to cell aggressive phenotypes. Integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 is a receptor of transmembrane heterodimeric cell surface adhesion, and its overexpression correlates with poor survival from non\u2013small cell lung cancer. However, the cross talk between \u03b1v\u03b26 and IL-8 in lung cancer has not been characterized so far. Herein, human lung cancer samples were analyzed, and it revealed that the immunohistochemical and mRNA expression of integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 was significantly correlated with the expression of IL-8. Furthermore, in vitro, integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 increased cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by impairing the expressions of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and inhibited cell apoptosis in human lung cancer cells A549 and H460. In addition, integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 upregulated IL-8 expression through activating MAPK/ERK signaling. The in vivo experiment showed that integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 promoted tumor growth in xenograft model mice by accelerating tumor volume and reducing apoptosis. Meanwhile, lung metastasis model experiment suggested that integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 stimulated tumor metastasis with the increase of lung/total weight and tumor nodules. Simultaneously, integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 upregulated IL-8 expression detected by both Western blots and immunohistochemistry, along with the activation of MAPK/ERK signaling. Overall, these data suggested that, in vitro and in vivo, integrin \u03b1v\u03b26 promoted lung cancer proliferation and metastasis, at least in part, through upregulation of IL-8\u2013mediated MAPK/ERK signaling.

To evaluate the association between PCA mRNA and disease progression, we analyzed PCA3 levels in connection with Gleason score and TNM stage of PCa. The clinical data revealed that expression of PCA3 gene was significantly higher in PCa than in BPH. Moreover, PCA3 mRNA was significantly higher in PCa patients with a Gleason score \u22658 than in those with a Gleason score \u22647 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). The results showed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.790, 0.606, and 0.620 for the copy number of PCA3, PSA level, and significantly free PSA (fPSA) level, respectively. Increased PCA3 in peripheral blood is correlated with PCa, and the detection of PCA3 may significantly reduce adverse screening outcomes. PCA3 gene expression in peripheral blood had a promising clinical application in the early diagnosis of PCa.",

We evaluated the association of a polymorphism at the 3\u2019UTR miRNA binding site of E2F1 gene (rs3213180) with risk of recurrence of SCCOP in a cohort of 1008 patients. Log-rank test and univariate and multivariable Cox models were used to evaluate the associations. Compared with patients with E2F1-rs3213180 GG homozygous genotype, the patients with E2F1-rs3213180GC\u00a0+\u00a0CC variant genotypes had significantly better disease-free survival (log-rank P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and decreased risk of SCCOP recurrence (HR, 0.4, 95% CI, 0.3\u20130.5) after multivariable adjustment. Furthermore, among patients with HPV16-positive tumors, the patients with E2F1-rs3213180 GC\u00a0+\u00a0CC variant genotypes had significantly better disease-free survival rates (log-rank P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and lower recurrence risk than those with E2F1-rs3213180 GG homozygous genotype (HR, 0.2, 95% CI, 0.1\u20130.4). Our findings suggest that E2F1-rs3213180 polymorphism may modulate the risk of recurrence in SCCOP patients, particularly for patients with HPV16-positive tumors of SCCOP.

The prediction of the fracture risk in metastatically involved spines can guide in deciding if preventive solutions, such as medical prophylaxis, bracing, or surgery are indicated for the patient. In this study, finite element models of 22 thoracolumbar vertebrae were built based on CT scans of three spines, covering a wide spectrum of possible clinical scenarios in terms of age, bone quality and degenerative features, taking into account the local material properties of bone tissue. Simulations were performed in order to investigate the effect of the size and location of the tumoral lesion, the bone quality and the vertebral level in determining the structural stability of the neoplastic vertebrae. Tumors with random size and positions were added to the models, for a total of 660 simulations in which a compressive load was simulated. Results highlighted the fundamental role of the tumor size, whereas the other parameters had a lower, but non-negligible impact on the axial collapse of the vertebra, the vertebral bulge in the transverse plane and the canal narrowing under the application of the load. All the considered parameters are radiologically measurable, and can therefore be translated in a straightforward way to the clinical practice to support decisions about preventive treatment of metastatic fractures.",

To solve this problem we have optimized a selection strategy based on PC immunomagnetic isolation that has allowed us to lower to 1% the minimal PC infiltration requirement without loss of purity, enabling to perform genetic analysis. In this study, we have analyzed 153 bone marrow samples of patients suspected of MM, collected from February 2015 to May 2017 by the Genetics service of the Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra. Clinical characteristics of the patients and PC immunophenotyping, conventional cytogenetics and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) analyses have been assessed on these samples.

The converted CSCs, named miPS-LLCcm cells, exhibited the self-renewal, differentiation potential, and potential to form malignant tumors with metastasis. In this study, we further characterized miPS-LLCcm cells both in vivo and in vitro. The tumors formed by subcutaneous injection showed the structures with pathophysiological features consisting of undifferentiated and malignant phenotypes generally found in adenocarcinoma. Metastasis in the lung was also observed as nodule structures. Excising from the tumors, primary cultured cells from the tumor and the nodule showed self-renewal, differentiation potential as well as tumor forming ability, which are the essential characters of CSCs. We then characterized the epigenetic regulation occurring in the CSCs. By comparing the DNA methylation level of CG rich regions, the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were evaluated in all stages of CSCs when compared with the parental iPSCs. In DMRs, hypomethylation was found superior to hypermethylation in the miPS-LLCcm cells and its derivatives. The hypo- and hypermethylated genes were used to nominate KEGG pathways related with CSC. As a result, several categories were defined in the KEGG pathways from which most related with cancers, significant and high expression of components was PI3K-AKT signaling pathway. Simultaneously, the AKT activation was also confirmed in the CSCs. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway should be an important pathway for the CSCs established by the treatment with conditioned medium of LLC cells.",

The main reason for this is related to the unique tumor stroma and poor vascularization of PDAC. As a consequence, chemotherapeutic drugs, such as nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine, cannot efficiently penetrate into the tumor tissue. Non-invasive radiofrequency (RF) mild hyperthermia treatment was proposed as a synergistic therapy to enhance drug uptake into the tumor by increasing tumor vascular inflow and perfusion, thus, increasing the effect of chemotherapy. RF-induced hyperthermia is a safer and non-invasive technique of tumor heating compared to conventional contact heating procedures. In this study, we investigated the short- and long-term effects (~20 days and 65 days, respectively) of combination chemotherapy and RF hyperthermia in an orthotopic PDAC model in mice. The benefit of nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine treatment was confirmed in mice; however, the effect of treatment was statistically insignificant in comparison to saline treated mice during long-term observation. The benefit of RF was minimal in the short-term and completely insignificant during long-term observation.",

Therefore, we explored HER2 3D detection by multiplexed imaging of Affibody-Quantum Dots conjugates (Aff-QD), ratiometric analysis (RMAFI) and thresholding, using BC multicellular tumor spheroids (BC-MTS) (~120 \u03bcm of diameter) as 3D model of BC.

Confocal XY sections were recorded along the Z distance, and processed by automatized RMAFI (anti-HER2 Aff-QD/ NC). Quantifying the NC fluorescence allowed to predict the fraction of non-specific accumulation of the anti-HER2 probe within the thick sample, and resolve the specific HER2 level. HER2 was detected up to 30\u00a0\u03bcm within intact BC-MTS, however, permeabilization improved detection up to 70\u00a0\u03bcm.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and microRNAs (DEMs) were identified. Functional, pathway enrichment, and protein-protein interaction analyses were performed on common DEGs across all datasets. The target genes of the DEMs were identified. DEMs targets that were also DEGs were further scrutinized using overall survival analysis. A total of 236 DEGs and 21 DEMs were identified. There were a total of four DEGs (ECT2, NR5A2, NRP2, and TGFBI), which were also predicted target genes of DEMs. Overall survival analysis showed that high expression levels of three of these genes (ECT2, NRP2, and TGFBI) were associated with poor overall survival for pancreatic cancer patients. The basic expression of DEGs in pancreas stood lower level in various organ tissues. The expression of ECT2 and NRP2 was higher in different pancreatic cancer cell lines than normal pancreas cell line. Knockout of ECT2 by Crispr Cas9 gene editing system decreased proliferation and migration ability in pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaCa2. In conclusion, we think that data mining method can do well in biomarker screening, and ECT2 and NRP2 can play as potential biomarker or therapy target by Crispr Cas9 in pancreatic cancer.",

Our group has recently shown that microRNAs in plasma from the MV\u2014but not the peripheral vein (PV)\u2014have been related to liver metastases in colon cancer (CC) patients. Here we examine the exosomal protein cargo in plasma from the MV and paired PV in 31 CC patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included patients who were initially diagnosed with stage I-III CC and 10 healthy controls. Exosomes from the MV and PV of all patients and controls were isolated by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. High-throughput proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry was used to identify expression levels of exosomal proteins. Findings were confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS: Exosomal ECM1 protein was more highly expressed in patients than in controls and was 13.55 times higher in MV from relapsed than relapse-free patients. High exosomal ECM1 expression was associated with liver metastases. Patients with high exosomal ECM1 expression in MV\u2014but not PV\u2014plasma had shorter time to relapse than those with low ECM1 expression (P = .04). CONCLUSION: High levels of exosomal ECM1 protein can identify CC patients with a higher risk of relapse.

Failure of cancer therapies can also be accredited to inability to systemically eradicate cancer stem cells (CSCs). Recent evidence points to the role of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in expanding the pool of tumor cells with CSCs features. Thus, we assessed expression level as well as heterogeneity of CSCs markers in primary tumors (PT), lymph node metastasis (LNM), and circulating tumor cells (CTCs)\u2013enriched blood fractions in order to correlate them with signs of EMT activation as well as clinicopathological data of breast cancer patients.

Heterogeneity of CSCs markers expression within each PT and LNM was assessed by calculating Gini Index. Percentage of ALDH1-positive cells was elevated in PT in comparison to LNM (P = .005). However, heterogeneity of the four CSCs markers: ALDH1 (P = .019), CD133 (P = .009), OCT-4 (P = .027), and CD44 (P < .001) was decreased in LNM. Samples classified as mesenchymal (post-EMT) showed elevated expression of CSCs markers (OCT-4 and CD44 in PT; OCT-4 in LNM; ALDH1, OCT-4, NANOG, CD44 in CTCs). Patients with mesenchymal-like CTCs had worse prognosis than patients with epithelial-like or no CTCs (P = .0025).

We correlated HBV-related pathogenesis in genetically engineered mice and human carriers with metabolic proteomics and lipogenic gene expression profiles. The immunohistochemistry showed that the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML, a tumor suppressor involved in genome maintenance and fatty acid oxidation), being inversely influenced by the dynamic HBsAg levels from acute phase to seroclearance, appeared as a lipo-metabolic switch linking HBsAg-induced steatosis (lipogenesis) to HBsAg-lost fat-burning hepatocarcinogenesis (lipolysis). Knockdown of PML in HBsAg-transgenic mice predisposed to obesity and drove early steatosis-specific liver tumorigenesis. Proteome analysis revealed that the signaling pathways corresponding to energy metabolism and its regulators were frequently altered by suppression or depletion of PML in the HBsAg-transgenic mice, mainly including oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism. Expression profiling further identified upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (Scd1) and epigenetic methylation of NDUFA13 in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the cell cycle inhibitor CDKN1c in concordance to the increased severity of lipodystrophy and neoplasia in the livers of HBsAg-transgenic mice with PML insufficiency. The defect in lipolysis in PML-deficient HBsAg-transgenic mice made the HBsAg-induced adipose-like liver tumors vulnerable to synthetic lethality from toxic saturated fat accumulation with a Scd1 inhibitor. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the evolution of steatosis-associated hepatic tumors driven by reciprocal interactions of HBsAg and PML, and a potential utility of lipid metabolic reprogramming as a treatment target.",

To further evaluate the effect of DDX3 inhibition on cell cycle progression over time, we performed timelapse microscopy of Fluorescent Ubiquitin Cell Cycle Indicators labeled cells after RK-33 or siDDX3 exposure.

Multivariate survival analysis showed that advanced stage and higher sPD-L1 levels (>25.1674 ng/ml) were independent prognostic factors for shorter PFS. In addition, higher sPD-L1 levels were positively correlated with advanced stage and negatively correlated with peripheral blood monocyte number.

Moreover, the expression of GALNT14 associates with the expression of P-gp, the efflux pump localized on the cell membrane, which could be the underlying mechanism of how GALNT14 induces MDR.

The effect of several parameters, including the method used for tissue lysis, RNAlater treatment, tissue weight at storage, and the time to storage after surgical resection, on the quantity and quality of RNA extracted was examined. Data showed that the highest quantity of RNA was isolated using a combination of manual and mechanical methods of tissue lysis. Additionally, sectioning the tissues into small pieces (<100 mg) and treating them with RNAlater solution prior to storage increased RNA stability. Following these guidelines, high quality RNA was obtained from 100% (8/8) of tumor tissues and 75% (6/8) of normal tissues. High-quality RNA was still stable under repeated freezing and thawing. The application of these results during sample handling and storage in clinical settings will facilitate the genetic diagnosis of diseases and their subsequent treatment.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The molecular mechanisms underlying aggressive versus indolent disease are not fully understood. Recent research has implicated a class of molecules known as long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in tumorigenesis and progression of cancer. Our objective was to discover lncRNAs that differentiate aggressive and indolent prostate cancers. METHODS: We analyzed paired tumor and normal tissues from six aggressive Gleason score (GS) 8-10 and six indolent GS 6 prostate cancers. Extracted RNA was split for poly(A)+ and ribosomal RNA depletion library preparations, followed byRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. We developed an RNA-Seq data analysis pipeline to discover and quantify these molecules. Candidate lncRNAs were validated using RT-qPCR on 87 tumor tissue samples: 28 (GS 6), 28 (GS 3+4), 6 (GS 4+3), and 25 (GS 8-10). Statistical correlations between lncRNAs and clinicopathologic variables were tested using ANOVA. RESULTS: The 43 differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs between aggressive and indolent prostate cancers included 12 annotated and 31 novel lncRNAs. The top six DE lncRNAs were selected based on large, consistent fold-changes in the RNA-Seq results. Three of these candidates passed RT-qPCR validation, including AC009014.3 (P < .001 in tumor tissue) and a newly discovered X-linked lncRNA named XPLAID (P = .049 in tumor tissue and P = .048 in normal tissue). XPLAID and AC009014.3 show promise as prognostic biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered several dozen lncRNAs that distinguish aggressive and indolent prostate cancers, of which four were validated using RT-qPCR. The investigation into their biology is ongoing.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: To build and validate a radiomics-based nomogram for the prediction of pre-operation lymph node (LN) metastasis in esophageal cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 197 esophageal cancer patients were enrolled in this study, and their LN metastases have been pathologically confirmed. The data were collected from January 2016 to May 2016; patients in the first three months were set in the training cohort, and patients in April 2016 were set in the validation cohort. About 788 radiomics features were extracted from computed tomography (CT) images of the patients. The elastic-net approach was exploited for dimension reduction and selection of the feature space. The multivariable logistic regression analysis was adopted to build the radiomics signature and another predictive nomogram model. The predictive nomogram model was composed of three factors with the radiomics signature, where CT reported the LN number and position risk level. The performance and usefulness of the built model were assessed by the calibration and decision curve analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen radiomics features were selected to build the radiomics signature. The radiomics signature was significantly associated with the LN metastasis (P<0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the radiomics signature performance in the training cohort was 0.806 (95% CI: 0.732-0.881), and in the validation cohort it was 0.771 (95% CI: 0.632-0.910). The model showed good discrimination, with a Harrell\u2019s Concordance Index of 0.768 (0.672 to 0.864, 95% CI) in the training cohort and 0.754 (0.603 to 0.895, 95% CI) in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis showed our model will receive benefit when the threshold probability was larger than 0.15. CONCLUSION: The present study proposed a radiomics-based nomogram involving the radiomics signature, so the CT reported the status of the suspected LN and the dummy variable of the tumor position. It can be potentially applied in the individual preoperative prediction of the LN metastasis status in esophageal cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women worldwide, with a developmental process spanning decades. The malignant cells recruit a variety of cells including fibroblasts, endothelial cells, immune cells, and adipocytes, creating the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment has emerged as active participants in breast cancer progression and response to treatment through autocrine and paracrine interaction with the malignant cells. Adipose tissue is abundant in the breast cancer microenvironment; interactions with cancer cells create cancer-associated adipocytes which produce a variety of adipokines that influence breast cancer initiation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and cachexia. Interleukin (IL)-6 has emerged as key compound significantly produced by breast cancer cells and adipocytes, with the potential of inducing proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype, stem cell phenotype, angiogenesis, cachexia, and therapeutic resistance in breast cancer cells. Our aim is to present a brief knowledge of IL-6\u2019s role in breast cancer. This review summarizes our current understanding of the breast microenvironment, with emphasis on adipocytes as key players in breast cancer tumorigenesis. The effects of key adipocytes such as leptin, adipokines, TGF-b, and IL-6 are discussed. Finally, we discuss the role of IL-6 in various aspects of cancer progression.",

However, its effect and molecular mechanism underlying radioresistance have not been fully elucidated in glioma. Here, RT-qPCR assay was used to assess the expressions of miR-320 and forkhead box protein M1 (FoxM1) mRNA in glioma tumor tissues and cells. The effects of miR-320, FoxM1 and sirtuin type 1 (Sirt1) on radiosensitivity in glioma cells were evaluated by clone formation assay, apoptosis assay, histone H2AX phosphorylation level (\u03b3H2AX) detection and caspase 3 activity analysis, respectively. The direct interaction between miR-320 and FoxM1 was detected by luciferase assay. The protein levels of FoxM1, Sirt1 and \u03b3H2AX were measured by western blot assay. We found that miR-320 expression was down-regulated and FoxM1 expression was up-regulated in radioresistant glioma tissues and IR-treated glioma cells. miR-320 overexpression dramatically enhanced radiosensitivity, promoted apoptosis, and improved \u03b3H2AX expression and caspase 3 activity in glioma cells. Luciferase reporter assay and western blot assay further validated that miR-320 suppressed FoxM1 expression by directly targeting 3\u2019 UTR region of FoxM1. Moreover, miR-320 inhibited Sirt1 expression via targeting FoxM1 in glioma cells.

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Despite therapeutic improvements, all patients with nonresectable metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) acquire resistance to treatment probably due to the growth of mutated clones. In contrast to tissue-based studies, liquid biopsies have enabled the opportunity to reveal emerging resistance to treatment by detecting mutated clones and noninvasively monitoring clonal dynamics during therapy. METHODS: The courses of three patients with mCRC who were initially RAS wild-type were monitored longitudinally using liquid biopsy with long-term follow-up of up to 20 sequential samples. Detection of fragmented RAS mutated circulating cell-free DNA (cf)DNA in plasma was performed by BEAMing. In addition, plasma digital droplet PCR was used to detect and quantify BRAF and PIK3CA mutated cfDNA. Changes of mutational load were correlated with imaging data. RESULTS: A combination of liquid biopsy and radiological imaging enabled visualization of the occurrence of clonal redistribution after discontinuation of anti-EGFR mAb therapy, as well as emerging RAS mutations during therapy with anti-EGFR mAb indicating resistance. Furthermore, we found that growth of RAS mutated clones is independent of direct selective pressure by anti-EGFR therapy, which is a significant and new finding of this study. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated the whole spectrum of clonal selection and redistribution of mutated cell clones leading to acquired resistance. Given our observation that the growth of RAS mutated clones can evolve even in the absence of anti-EGFR mAb therapy, there is a clear imperative to monitor RAS mutations in serial blood draws in all RAS wild-type patients in general and independent of the therapy.",

Exosomes can mediate the intercellular transfer of proteins and RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), and promote both tumorigenesis and premetastatic niche formation. In this study, we performed exosomal RNA sequencing to identify candidate exosomal miRNAs that could be associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) and its distant metastasis. The expression profiles of exosomal miRNA, as secreted by isogenic human primary CRC cell line SW480 and highly metastatic cell line SW620, were analyzed and the potential targets related to tumorigenesis and metastatic progression were investigated. We found that 25 miRNAs had been up-regulated and 5 miRNAs had been down-regulated in exosomes purified from SW620 culture supernatant. Candidate miRNAs were further evaluated for CRC diagnosis using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in CRC patients. Higher expression levels of circulating exosomal miR-17-5p and miR-92a-3p were significantly associated with pathologic stages and grades of the CRC patients. CONCLUSIONS: Circulating exosomal miR-17-5p and miR-92a-3p may provide a promising noninvasive prognostic biomarker for primary and metastatic CRC.",

A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) A1166C located in 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of AGTR1 and an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism present in intron 16 of ACE gene have been associated with many diseases, but their association with Breast cancer (BCa) is still debatable. Here, we for the first time investigated the association of these polymorphisms in a North Indian BCa cohort including 161 patients and 152 healthy women. The polymorphisms were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) respectively. The association between these polymorphisms and BCa risk was estimated by calculating Odds Ratio (OR) and chi-square (\u03c72) test. The DD genotype/D allele of ACE (I/D) polymorphism and \u201cAC and CC\u201d genotype/C allele of AGTR1 (A1166C) polymorphism were associated with higher risk of BCa when evaluated independently. Furthermore, interaction analysis of \u201cAC and CC\u201d and DD genotype and combination of \u201cC and D\u201d alleles of both polymorphisms revealed significantly greater BCa risk than that observed independently. Conclusively, women harboring \u201cAC or CC\u201d genotype/C allele for AGTR1 (A1166C) polymorphism and DD genotype/D allele for ACE (I/D) polymorphisms have a predisposition to develop more aggressive disease with advanced staging and larger tumor size.

The correlation of BPE with factors such as fibroglandular tissue (FGT), age, menopausal status, breast cancer, high-risk precondition as well as motion were investigated using linear regression. RESULTS: BPE positively correlated with FGT (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and negatively correlated with menopausal status (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Cancer did not show an effect on BPE (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05). A high-risk precondition showed a significant impact on the formation of BPE (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). However, when corrected for motion, the correlation between BPE and a high-risk precondition became weak and insignificant, and a highly significant association between BPE and motion was revealed (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). CONCLUSION: BPE positively correlated with FGT and negatively correlated with age. Cancer did not have an effect on BPE. A high-risk precondition appears to have a negative effect on BPE.

We pulsed dendritic cells with exosomes derived from tumor cells (DC-TEX) and found that the number of T-regulatory cells decreased and the number of CD8+T cells increased.

Alpha-emitting radionuclides injected intraperitoneally may be an attractive therapeutic option in this situation as they are highly cytotoxic, while their short range in tissues can spare surrounding radiosensitive organs in the abdomen. Herein we evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of a novel \u03b1-emitting compound specifically designed for intracavitary radiation therapy. METHODS: The \u03b1-emitter 224Ra was absorbed on calcium carbonate microparticles. Immunodeficient, athymic nude mice with human ovarian cancer cells growing intraperitoneally were treated with different activity levels of 224Ra-microparticles. Tumor growth, survival, and tolerance of the treatment were assessed. Two tumor models based on the cell lines, ES-2 and SKOV3-luc, with different growth patterns were studied. RESULTS: In both models, intraperitoneal treatment with 224Ra-microparticles gave significant antitumor effect with either considerably reduced tumor volume or a survival benefit. An advantageous discovery was that only a few kilobecquerels per mouse were needed to yield therapeutic effects. The treatment was well tolerated up to a dose of 1000 kBq/kg with no signs of acute or subacute toxicity observed.

Previously, two formulas based on a logistic tumor growth model were proposed to predict tumor cellularity with DWI and DCE. The purpose of this study was to proof these formulas. METHODS: 16 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were included into the study. There were 2 women and 14 men with a mean age of 57.0 \u00b1 7.5 years. In every case, tumor cellularity was calculated using the proposed formulas by Atuegwu et al. In every case, also tumor cell count was estimated on histopathological specimens as an average cell count per 2 to 5 high-power fields. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between the calculated cellularity and histopathologically estimated cell count by using the formula based on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. A moderate positive correlation (r=0.515, P=.041) could be identified by using the formula including ADC and Ve values.

In this study, we performed an exhaustive analysis of immunogenic signatures in TNBC based on 2 large-scale breast cancer (BC) genomic data. We compared enrichment levels of 26 immune cell activities and pathways among TNBC, non-TNBC, and normal tissue, and within TNBCs of different genotypic or phenotypic features. We found that almost all analyzed immune activities and pathways had significantly higher enrichment levels in TNBC than non-TNBC. Elevated enrichment of these immune activities and pathways was likely to be associated with better survival prognosis in TNBC.

We could show that a combination of PAMP can eradicate solid tumours in cancer mice if applied several times. Accordingly, we suggested to combine PAMP containing approved drugs to treat cancer patients using a protocol similar to the old fever induction regimen. In this retrospective phase-1 study we report on the fever induction capacity and safety of applications of bacterial extracts, combinations of bacterial extracts with approved drugs, and combinations of approved drugs in 131 mainly cancer patients. Adverse reactions were those which can be expected during a feverish infection and mild. Over 523 fever inductions, no severe adverse reaction was observed.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of nimotuzumab combined with radiotherapy (RT) in elderly patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The clinical data of 75 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, who were initially treated with nimotuzumab combined with RT, were collected and retrospectively reviewed from December 2008 to April 2014. They were aged 60 to 81 years (median 64 years). The distribution of disease was stage II in 10 (13.3%), stage III in 33 (44.0%), and stage IV in 32 (42.7%). Among these patients, 59 cases received cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Survival outcomes and treatment toxicity were analyzed using IBM SPSS 19.0 software. RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 45 months (range, 13-78 months), the estimated 3-year local recurrence-free survival (LRFS), regional recurrence-free survival (RRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), progression failure-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates were 95.6%, 95.5%, 98.6%, 89.7%, and 89.2%, respectively. In the subgroup, 3-year OS rate in the patients with concurrent chemotherapy was 90.5% and 77.4% in patients without concurrent chemotherapy (Log-Rank = 1.795, P = .180). Univariate analysis showed that T stage and clinical stage were correlated with OS. Multivariate analysis indicated that age, T stage and tumor response at the end of treatment were independent prognosticators. Nine patients experienced grade 3 to 4 acute mucositis and 26 patients experienced grade 3-4 leukocytopenia, with no cases of skin rash and infusion reaction. Twelve patients developed mild liver function damage. No serious gastrointestinal or renal toxicities were observed. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of combined nimotuzumab with RT in elderly NPC patients was encouraging and the toxicities were accepted. In addition, nimotuzumab provides a better option for elderly patients who cannot be tolerate chemotherapy.",

Both in vitro and in vivo binding assays show that EFEMP2 is associated with GALNT14. Moreover, we find that GALNT14 mediates glycosylation of EFEMP2. EFEMP2 significantly increased the invasion ability of breast cancer cells including MCF-7 and MBA-MD-231 cells, and this phenomenon is suppressed by knockdown expression of GALNT14. In addition, the GALNT14-dependent O-glycosylation of EFEMP-2 regulates the stability of EFEMP-2 protein in breast cancer cells.

However, the serum levels of chemokines in BTCs have not yet been explored. METHODS: The sera of healthy donors (n = 8) and patients with BTCs who were enrolled in second line sunitinib trials (n = 27) were collected. The concentrations of three kinds of chemokines (CXCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL12) were measured using ELISA assay. The median concentrations of chemokines were compared between healthy donors and BTC patients and the role of chemokines as a prognostic biomarker was examined. RESULTS: BTC patients generally had higher serum levels of CXCL5 and CXCL12 compared to healthy donors. Patients with cholangiocarcinoma showed significantly higher levels of serum CXCL12 than patients with gallbladder cancer. In survival analysis, only CXCL12 level showed a prognostic impact on overall survival (median OS: 6.9 vs. 0.9 months in low CXCL12 vs. high CXCL12, respectively; P = .008). High CXCL5 levels were also correlated with poor survival without statistical insignificance (median OS: 6.2 vs. 2.0 months in low CXCL5 vs. high CXCL5, respectively; P = .070). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference in OS according to the level of CXCL12, suggesting that serum CXCL12 levels may be a useful surrogate marker for clinical outcome in advanced BTCs.",

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the assay. Anti-TUBB3 antibodies discriminated OC patients and healthy individuals with excellent sensitivity and specificity (91.8% and 90.9%, respectively). In multivariate analysis, anti-TUBB3 antibody level emerged as an independent prognostic factor for progression free and overall survival. The ELISA was then optimized using a biotin-labeled TUBB3 C-terminal peptide424-450 instead of recombinant TUBB3 as the antigen and streptavidin-coated plates. The diagnostic role of the anti-TUBB3 antibodies was studied in an independent series of 99 OC patients and 80 gynecological benign disease patients. ROC-curve analysis showed a valuable diagnostic potential for serum anti-TUBB3 antibodies to identify OC patients with higher sensitivity and specificity (95.3% and 97.6%, respectively). Overall, our results provide evidence that preoperative anti-TUBB3 antibody level is a promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the management of OC patients.",

Pre- and post-nCR mean ADC values in the tumors were compared using Wilcoxon matched pairs test. Correlation of pathological treatment response and ADC values was assessed using Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient test and receiver-operating-curve (ROC) analysis. RESULTS: The average mean and standard deviation (SD) of the ADC values for all the patients analyzed were significantly higher in post-nCR (1.667\u00b10.161\u00d710-3) compared with those prior to nCR (1.395\u00b10.136\u00d710-3 mm2/sec), (P<0.05). The mean ADC values after nCR were significantly correlated with the pathological responses (r=-0.5172); P=0.02. The area under the curve (AUC) of the ADC values for differentiating G1, G2 and G3 pathological responses, using ROC analysis, was found to be 0.6310 and P=0.03.

METHODS: Patients admitted with LAPC underwent diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) scan at 3.0-T (b = 600 s/mm2). The mean signal intensity (SIb = 600) of region-of-interest (ROI) was measured. The Log-rank test was done for tumor location, biliary stent, S-1, and other treatments and the Cox regression analysis was done to identify independent prognostic factors for OS. Prediction error curves (PEC) were used to assess potential errors in prediction of survival. The accuracy of prediction was evaluated by Integrated Brier Score (IBS) and C index. RESULTS: 41 patients were included in this study. The median OS was 11.7 months (2.8-23.23 months). The 1-year OS was 46%. Multivariate analysis showed that pre-treatment SIb = 600 value and administration of S-1 were independent predictors for OS. The performance of pre-treatment SIb = 600 and S-1 treatment in combination was better than that of SIb = 600 or S-1 treatment alone. CONCLUSION: The combination of pre-treatment SIb = 600 and S-1 treatment could predict the OS in patients with LAPC undergoing SBRT and sequential S-1 therapy with improved accuracy compared with that of established clinical and radiologic risk models.",

Inspite of early encouraging results, it however gave only modest clinical benefits. When AAG was administered with discontinuous schedule, the disease showed acceleration in certain cases. Though resistance to AAG has been extensively studied, it is not documented for discontinuous schedules. To simulate clinical situations, we subjected a patient-derived CRC subcutaneous xenograft in mice to three different protocols: 1) AAG (bevacizumab) treatment for 30 days (group A) (group B was the control), 2) bevacizumab treatment for 50 days (group C) and bevacizumab for 30 days and 20 without treatment (group D), and 3) bevacizumab treatment for 70 days (group E) and 70 days treatment with a drug-break period between day 30 and 50 (group F). The tumor growth was monitored, and at sacrifice, the vascularity of tumors was measured and the proangiogenic factors quantified. Tumor phenotype was studied by quantifying cancer stem cells. Interrupting bevacizumab during treatment accelerated tumor growth and revascularization. A significant increase of proangiogenic factors was observed when therapy was stopped. On withdrawal of bevacizumab, as also after the drug-break period, the plasmatic VEGF increased significantly. Similarly, a notable increase of CSCs after the withdrawal and drug-break period of bevacizumab was observed (P<.01). The present study indicates that bevacizumab treatment needs to be maintained because discontinuous schedules tend to trigger tumor regrowth, and increase tumor resistance and CSC heterogeneity.",

Cancer metastasis is a multistep process associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program. Several studies have demonstrated that transcriptional repressor GATA binding 1 (TRPS1) played important roles in development and progression of primary BC. In this study we sought to identify the mechanisms responsible for this function of TRPS1 in the continuum of the metastatic cascade. Here we described that TRPS1 was significantly associated with BC metastasis using public assessable datasets. Clinically, loss of TRPS1 expression in BC was related to higher histological grade. In vitro functional study and bioinformatics analysis revealed that TRPS1 inhibited cell migration and EMT in BC. Importantly, we identified SUZ12 as a novel target of TRPS1 related to EMT program. ChIP assay demonstrated TRPS1 directly inhibited SUZ12 transcription by binding to the SUZ12 promoter. Loss of TRPS1 resulted in increased SUZ12 binding and H3K27 tri-methylation at the CDH1 promoter and repression of E-cadherin. In all, our data indicated that TRPS1 maintained the expression of E-cadherin by inhibiting SUZ12, which might provide novel insight into how loss of TRPS1 contributed to BC progression.",

Nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel (nab-paclitaxel) is a novel albumin-stabilized, cremophor-free and water soluble nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, and the potential role of nab-paclitaxel has not been tested yet in experimental EAC. Here we tested the antiproliferative and antitumor efficacy with survival advantage of nab-paclitaxel as monotherapy and in combinations in in-vitro, and in murine subcutaneous xenograft and peritoneal metastatic survival models of human EAC. Nab-paclitaxel significantly inhibited in-vitro cell proliferation with higher in-vivo antitumour efficacy and survival benefit compared to paclitaxel or carboplatin treatments both in mono- and combination therapies. Nab-paclitaxel treatment increased expression of mitotic-spindle associated phospho-stathmin, decreased expression of proliferative markers and enhanced apoptosis. This study demonstrates that nab-paclitaxel had stronger antiproliferative and antitumor activity in experimental EAC than the current standard chemotherapeutic agents which supports the rationale for its clinical use in EAC.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical relevance of detecting sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in colon cancer patients by measuring the novel metastasis marker PHGR1 mRNA. METHODS: Using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, we measured PHGR1 mRNA levels in SLNs and primary tumors from 206 patients surgically treated for stage I to III colon cancer and 52 normal LNs from patients undergoing surgery for benign colon diseases. The prognostic impact of these findings was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression. RESULTS: Compared to normal LNs, elevated PHGR1 mRNA levels were detected in SLNs from 56 (89%) of the 63 patients with pN+ disease. Furthermore, 68 (48%) of the 143 node-negative (pN0) patients had elevated PHGR1 mRNA levels in SLNs, suggesting occult metastases. With a median follow-up of 7.2 years, a significantly shorter recurrence-free (P=.005) and disease-specific (P=.02) survival was observed in patients with elevated PHGR1 mRNA levels in SLNs. Multivariable modeling showed that the SLN PHGR1 mRNA level was an independent prognostic factor. However, when the survival analyses were restricted to pN0 patients, no significant prognostic information was found. CONCLUSION: Measuring PHGR1 mRNA in SLNs provided independent prognostic information on operable colon cancer patients but not in the pN0 subgroup.",

A total of 172 consecutive patients with chordoma who underwent radical resection were reviewed. R software was used to randomly select 86 chordoma patients as a training set and 86 chordoma patients as a validation set. Potential prognostic factors were also identified, including age, sex, tumor localization, KPS, Enneking stage, tumor size, and tumor metastasis. Overall survival (OS) was calculated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and multivariate Cox regression analyses. NLR, PLR, SII, Enneking stage, tumor differentiation and tumor metastasis were identified as significant factors from the univariate analysis in both the training and validation sets and were subjected to multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. The univariate analysis showed that NLR \u22651.65, PLR \u2265121, and SII \u2265370\u00d7109/L were significantly associated with poor OS. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, SII, Enneking stage and tumor metastasis were significantly associated with OS.

The IHC analysis detailed herein is the comprehensive biological analysis of the tumor specificity of JAA-F11 antibody performed as JAA-F11 is progressing towards preclinical safety testing and clinical trials. Wide tumor reactivity of JAA-F11, relative to the matched mouse IgG3 (control), was observed in 85% of 1269 cases of breast, lung, prostate, colon, bladder, and ovarian cancer. Staining on tissues from breast cancer cases was similar regardless of hormonal or Her2 status, and this is particularly important in finding a target on the currently untargetable triple-negative breast cancer subtype.

The aim of the study was to assess the respective marker gene expression in patients treated with radical cystectomy for muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) and to evaluate the applicability of breast cancer subtypes for MIBC risk stratification. MATERIALS & METHODS: 102 patients treated with radical cystectomy for MIBC were assessed. Using routine FFPE tissue and an IVD validated kit, mRNA expression was measured by single step RT-qPCR. Partition test were employed to define cut-off values for high or low marker gene expression. Association of expression with outcome was assessed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate cox regression analysis. Finally, we performed validation of our results in the MD-Anderson cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a057). RESULTS: Cancer specific survival (CSS) was impaired in patients with high gene expression of Her2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0009) and ESR1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In the multivariate regression model Her2 expression remained significant for the prediction of CSS (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.11, CI 1.11-4.21, P\u00a0=\u00a00.024). Furthermore, molecular stratification by breast cancer subgroups was significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.023) for CSS prediction. Especially the differentiation between Her2-positive and Luminal A (HR\u00a0=\u00a04.41, CI 1.53-18.71, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and Luminal B (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.96, CI 0.99-4.08, P\u00a0=\u00a00.053) respectively was an independent prognostic parameter for CSS. External validation resulted in comparable risk stratification with differences in fractional subgroups distribution. CONCLUSION: Gene expression of Her2, ESR1, PGR, Ki67 and corresponding breast cancer subtypes allow a risk-stratification in MIBC, whereby Her2 overexpressing tumors reveal a particularly poor prognosis.",

Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) facilitates cure of bone marrow failure and leukemia and thus extends life expectancy in FA patients; however, survival of hematologic malignancies increases the risk of OSCC in these patients. We developed a \u201ccytology-on-a-chip\u201d (COC)\u2013based brush biopsy assay for monitoring patients with oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs). Using this COC assay, we measured and correlated the cellular morphometry and Minichromosome Maintenance Complex Component 2 (MCM2) expression levels in brush biopsy samples of FA patients\u2019 OPMD with clinical risk indicators such as loss of autofluorescence (LOF), HSCT status, and mutational profiles identified by next-generation sequencing. Statistically significant differences were found in several cytology measurements based on high-risk indicators such as LOF-positive and HSCT-positive status, including greater variation in cell area and chromatin distribution, higher MCM2 expression levels, and greater numbers of white blood cells and cells with enlarged nuclei. Higher OPMD risk scores were associated with differences in the frequency of nuclear aberrations and differed based on LOF and HSCT statuses. We identified mutation of FAT1 gene in five and NOTCH-2 and TP53 genes in two cases of FA patients\u2019 OPMD. The high-risk OPMD of a non-FA patient harbored FAT1, CASP8, and TP63 mutations. Use of COC assay in combination with visualization of LOF holds promise for the early diagnosis of high-risk OPMD. These minimally invasive diagnostic tools are valuable for long-term surveillance of OSCC in FA patients and avoidance of unwarranted scalpel biopsies.",

     "abstract": "The C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) pathway can promote tumor metastasis but is dependent on cross talk with other signaling pathways. The MET proto-oncogene (c-MET) participates in metastasis and is highly expressed in gastric cancer. However, the relationship between CXCR4 and c-MET signaling and their mechanisms of action in gastric cancer metastasis remain unclear. In this study, in vitro experiments demonstrated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)/CXCR4 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotes migration in gastric cancer cells, which is accompanied by c-MET activation. These phenomena were reversed by c-MET inhibition. Further investigation revealed that c-MET activation correlated with its interaction with caveolin 1 in lipid rafts, induced by CXCL12. In clinical samples, we observed a significant positive association between CXCR4 expression and c-MET phosphorylation (r = 0.259, P = .005). Moreover, samples expressing both receptors were found to indicate significantly poorer patient prognosis (P < .001). These results suggest that CXCL12 induces EMT at least partially through cross talk between CXCR4 and c-MET signaling. In addition, changes in these pathways could have clinical importance for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

In 2 studies (23 patients), relationships between KI 67 and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging were reported. The pooled correlation coefficient between Ktrans and KI 67 was \u22120.68 (95% CI = [\u22120.91; \u22120.44]). Two studies (31 patients) investigated correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and KI 67. The pooled correlation coefficient was \u22120.61 (95% CI = [\u22120.84; \u22120.38]). In 2 studies (117 patients), relationships between 18F-FDG PET and p53 were analyzed. The pooled correlation coefficient was 0.0 (95% CI = [\u22120.87; 0.88]). There were 3 studies (48 patients) that investigated associations between ADC and tumor cell count in HNSCC. The pooled correlation coefficient was \u22120.53 (95% CI = [\u22120.74; \u22120.32]). Associations between 18F-FDG PET and HIF-1\u03b1 were investigated in 3 studies (72 patients). The pooled correlation coefficient was 0.44 (95% CI = [\u22120.20; 1.08]). CONCLUSIONS: ADC may predict cell count and proliferation activity, and SUVmax may predict expression of HIF-1\u03b1 in HNSCC. SUVmax cannot be used as surrogate marker for expression of KI 67 and p53.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) quantifies motion of hydrogen nuclei in biological tissues and hereby has been used to assess the underlying tissue microarchitecture. Histogram-profiling of DWI provides more detailed information on diffusion characteristics of a lesion than the standardly calculated values of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)\u2014minimum, mean and maximum. Hence, the aim of our study was to investigate, which parameters of histogram-profiling of DWI in primary central nervous system lymphoma can be used to specifically predict features like cellular density, chromatin content and proliferative activity. PROCEDURES: Pre-treatment ADC maps of 21 PCNSL patients (8 female, 13 male, 28\u201389 years) from a 1.5T system were used for Matlab-based histogram profiling. Results of histopathology (H&E staining) and immunohistochemistry (Ki-67 expression) were quantified. Correlations between histogram-profiling parameters and neuropathologic examination were calculated using SPSS 23.0. RESULTS: The lower percentiles (p10 and p25) showed significant correlations with structural parameters of the neuropathologic examination (cellular density, chromatin content). The highest percentile, p90, correlated significantly with Ki-67 expression, resembling proliferative activity. Kurtosis of the ADC histogram correlated significantly with cellular density. CONCLUSIONS: Histogram-profiling of DWI in PCNSL provides a comprehensible set of parameters, which reflect distinct tumor-architectural and tumor-biological features, and hence, are promising biomarkers for treatment response and prognosis.",

     "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) targets the liver and is a major driver for liver cancer. Clinical data suggest that HBV infection is associated with reduced response to treatment with the multi-kinase inhibitor sorafenib, the first available molecularly targeted anti-hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) drug. Given that Raf is one of the major targets of sorafenib, we investigated the activation state of the Raf-Mek-Erk pathway in the presence of HBV and in response to sorafenib. Here we show that hepatoma cells with replicating HBV are less susceptible to sorafenib inhibitory effect as compared to cells in which HBV expression is suppressed. However, although HBV replication is associated with increased level of pErk, its blockade only modestly augments sorafenib effect. In contrast, the phosphorylated form of the pro-oncogenic Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 14 (pMAPK14), a protein kinase that was recently linked to sorafenib resistance, is induced in sorafenib-treated hepatoma cells in association with HBV X protein expression. Knocking down pMAPK14 results in augmentation of the therapeutic efficacy of sorafenib and largely alleviates resistance to sorafenib in the presence of HBV. Thus, this study suggests that HBV promotes HCC resistance to sorafenib. Combining pMAPK14 inhibitors with sorafenib may be beneficial in patients with HBV-associated HCC.",

Progestin action is mediated through two progesterone receptor (PR) isoforms, PRA and PRB, with unique transcriptional activity and function. The current study examines hormonal regulation of PR isoforms in the normal postmenopausal human breast and the mechanism by which progestins increase proliferation and breast cancer risk. Archival benign breast biopsies from postmenopausal and premenopausal women, and luminal breast tumor biopsies from postmenopausal women, were analyzed for regulation of PRA and PRB expression by E and E+medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA). In the postmenopausal breast without HRT, PRA and PRB expression was decreased compared to the premenopausal breast. Both E (n = 12) and E+MPA (n = 13) HRT in the postmenopausal breast were associated with increased PRA and PRB expression, increased nuclear cyclin E expression, and decreased nuclear p27 expression compared to no HRT (n = 16). With E+MPA HRT, there was a further decrease in nuclear p27 and increased Receptor Activator of NF-kappa B Ligand (RANKL) expression compared to E-alone HRT. In luminal breast cancers, E+MPA HRT (n = 6) was also associated with decreased nuclear expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 compared to E HRT (n = 6), but was not associated with increased proliferation. These results suggest that p27 mediates progestin-induced proliferation in the normal human breast and that regulation of this proliferative response by E+MPA is lost in breast tumors.",

METHODS: A monoclonal antibody was raised against the neo-epitope tumstatin. A novel competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of tumstatin (TUM), was developed and technically characterized. Levels of TUM were measured in serum of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) belonging to two cohorts. RESULTS: The developed TUM enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was technically robust. In cohort 1, levels of TUM were significantly higher in NSCLC compared to healthy controls, IPF, and COPD (P = 0.007, P = 0.03 and P = 0.001, respectively). The area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) for separation of patients with NSCLC from healthy controls was 0.97, for separation of NSCLC and IPF patients was 0.98, and for separation of NSCLC and COPD patients was 1.0. In cohort 2, levels of TUM were also significantly higher in patients with NSCLC compared to healthy controls (P = 0.002), and the AUROC for separation of NSCLC and healthy controls was 0.73. CONCLUSIONS: We developed a technically robust competitive ELISA targeting the fragment tumstatin.

However, long-term epidemiological observations between the treatment period, cumulative dose, and intensity of metformin and CRC are rarely reported. The aim of this study was to identify the association between the effect of metformin and CRC development in a nationwide cohort study. METHODS: This nationwide population-based study examined a cohort of 1,000,000 patients randomly sampled from individuals enrolled in the Taiwan National Health Insurance system. Patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) between 1997 and 2007 were enrolled. A statistical variables, including the demographic data, treatment period, cumulative dose, and intensity of metformin use, was compared between patients developing CRC and those without CRC. RESULTS: This study included 47,597 patients. The mean follow-time was 7.17 \u00b1 3.21 years. After adjustment, metformin use was an independent protective factor against CRC development (P < .001). Although the protective ability of metformin against CRC development was reduced during long-term therapy, the risk of CRC decreased progressively with a higher cumulative dose or higher intensity of metformin use (both P < .001). CONCLUSION: This study revealed that metformin use significantly reduced the risk of CRC in a dose-dependent manner in patients with type 2 DM in the Taiwanese population. However, a gradual decline in medication adherence may reduce the protective ability of metformin against CRC development during long-term therapy.",

This study sought to explore the presence of C. trachomatis DNA and chlamydial heat shock protein 60 (chsp60) in ovarian tissue, as well as anti-chlamydial IgG antibodies in plasma, in relation to subtypes of EOC. METHODS: This cross-sectional cohort consisted of 69 women who underwent surgery due to suspected ovarian pathology. Ovarian tissue and corresponding blood samples were collected at the time of diagnosis. In ovarian tumor tissue, p53, p16, Ki67 and chsp60 were analyzed immunohistochemically, and PCR was used to detect C. trachomatis DNA. Plasma C. trachomatis IgG and cHSP60 IgG were analyzed with a commercial MIF-test and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: Eight out of 69 women had C. trachomatis DNA in their ovarian tissue, all were invasive ovarian cancer cases (16.7% of invasive EOC).

     "abstract": "Spontaneous tumor hemorrhage (TH) is frequently observed in solid tumors including human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TH implies fast-growing and worse tumor immunological microenvironment; however, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. CLEC1B is a signature gene highly associated with tumor progression. PD-L1 expression is a key biomarker predictive of immune checkpoint therapies, which showed astonishing effect on various types of tumor. We assume that, in HCC, TH may closely associate with the expression of these two molecules. In this study, 136 patients with HCC were enrolled. qRT-PCR showed that CLEC1B expression is significantly lower in HCC tumor tissue. Immunohistochemistry of HCC tissue microarrays demonstrated that PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow expressions were significantly correlated with TH and clinicopathological features indicating worse HCC progression. According to univariate/multivariate analysis, a combination of PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow expression was an independent prognostic factor indicating the poor outcome. The prognostic value of PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow was validated by Cox proportional-hazard analyses. Collectively, tumor with TH is closely associated with CLEC1Blow & PD-L1high expression, which may imply high response of PD-L1/PD-1 immune checkpoint therapies. CLEC1B may be a potential therapeutic target for PD-L1/PD-1 immunotherapy. PD-L1high and CLEC1Blow can be a valuable prognosis factor implying worse clinical outcomes.",

METHODS: We assessed the expression of PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1 by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissue from 90 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. The results were validated in an independent cohort of additional 90 HCC patients. RESULTS: PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1 exhibited in tumor tissue high expression rates of 41.11% (37/90) and 43.33% (43/90), respectively, and their expressions were positively correlated (r = 0.563, P < .01). High expression of PD-L1 was significantly associated with low albumin levels (P < .05); high expression of HIF-1\u03b1 was significantly correlated with high alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels and low albumin levels (P < .05); high expression of both PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1 was also significantly associated with high AFP levels and low albumin levels (P < .05). High expression of PD-L1, HIF-1\u03b1, as well as both PD-L1 and HIF-1 \u03b1 was respectively significantly associated with worse overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P < .05). Patients with co-overexpression of PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1 had the worst prognosis compared with other groups. Additionally, multivariate Cox regression models suggested that high expression of PD-L1, HIF-1\u03b1, as well as both PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1 was an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS (P < .05). Furthermore, the positive correlation and prognostic values of PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1 were validated in an independent data set. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that HCC patients with co-overexpression of PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1 in tumor tissue had a significantly higher risk of recurrence or metastasis and death compared with others. Therefore, more frequent follow-up is needed for patients with co-overexpression of PD-L1 and HIF-1\u03b1. At the same time, a combinational therapy with HIF-1\u03b1 inhibitors in conjunction with PD-L1 blockade may be beneficial for HCC patients with co-overexpression in the future.",

     "abstract": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma, designated as a recalcitrant cancer by the National Cancer Institute, in urgent need of new rational therapeutic targets. Previous studies have determined that the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) is essential for the survival and progression of a fraction of pulmonary neuroendocrine cancer cells, which include both SCLC and a subset of non-SCLC. Previously, to understand how ASCL1 initiates tumorigenesis in pulmonary neuroendocrine cancer and identify the transcriptional targets of ASCL1, whole-genome RNA-sequencing analysis combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing was performed with a series of lung cancer cell lines. From this analysis, we discovered that the gene SCNN1A, which encodes the alpha subunit of the epithelial sodium channel (\u03b1ENaC), is highly correlated with ASCL1 expression in SCLC. The product of the SCNN1A gene ENaC can be pharmacologically inhibited with amiloride, a drug that has been used clinically for close to 50 years. Amiloride inhibited growth of ASCL1-dependent SCLC more strongly than ASCL1-independent SCLC in vitro and slowed growth of ASCL1-driven SCLC in xenografts. We conclude that SCNN1A/\u03b1ENaC is a direct transcriptional target of the neuroendocrine lung cancer lineage oncogene ASCL1 that can be pharmacologically targeted with antitumor effects.",

Frozen section analysis of lymph nodes is a reliable method for detection of macro-metastases. However, this method is far less effective in detecting micro-metastases, requesting improved diagnostic procedures. METHODS: We investigated expression and truncation of ezrin in (i) sentinel lymph node metastases, (ii) unaffected axillary lymph nodes, (iii) primary breast tumors, and (iv) healthy glandular breast tissues using 2D gel electrophoresis, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry in addition to Western blotting. RESULTS: Full-length ezrin (E1; amino acids 1\u2013586) is present in all four investigated tissues. Two truncated ezrin forms, one missing about the first hundred amino acids (E2a) and the other lacking about 150 C-terminal amino acids (E2b) were detectable in primary tumor tissues and in sentinel lymph node metastases but not in glandular tissues. Strikingly, an ezrin truncation (E3) which consists approximately of amino acids 238\u2013586 was found strongly expressed in all sentinel lymph node metastases. Moreover, an N-terminal ezrin fragment (E4) that consists approximately of amino acids 1\u2013273 was identified in sentinel lymph node metastases as well. CONCLUSIONS: We show for the first time the existence of tissue-dependent specific ezrin truncations. The distinguished strong Western blot staining of ezrin E3 in sentinel lymph node metastases underlines its capability to substantiate the occurrence of lymph node (micro)metastases in breast cancer patients.",

The functionality of EphA2-specific T cells in vitro was tested with flow cytometry and real-time cell electronic sensing system assays. The effect in vivo was evaluated in xenograft SCID Beige mouse model of EphA2 positive NSCLC. These EphA2-specifc T cells can cause tumor cell lysis by producing the cytokines IFN-\u03b3 when cocultured with EphA2-positive targets, and the cytotoxicity effects was specific in vitro. In vivo, the tumor signals of mice treated with EphA2-specifc T cells presented the tendency of decrease, and was much lower than the mice treated with non-transduced T cells.

Among PTs, malignant PTs (MPTs) have malignant characteristics and distant metastases occur in about 20% to 30% of MPTs. However, there is no effective treatment for MPTs with distant metastasis, resulting in an abject prognosis. We performed targeted deep sequencing on PTs to identify the associations between genetic alterations and clinical prognosis. METHODS: We performed targeted deep sequencing to evaluate the genetic characteristics of PTs and analyzed the relationships between clinical and genetic characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 17 PTs were collected between 2001 and 2012. Histologic review was performed by pathologists. The samples included three benign PTs, one borderline PT, and 13 MPTs. The most frequently detected genetic alteration occurred in the TERT promoter region (70.6%), followed by MED12 (64.7%). EGFR amplification and TP53 alteration were detected in four MPTs without genetic alterations in MED12 and TERT promoter regions. Genetic alterations of RARA and ZNF703 were repeatedly found in PTs with local recurrence, and genetic alterations of SETD2, BRCA2, and TSC1 were detected in PTs with distant metastasis. Especially, MPT harboring PTEN and RB1 copy number deletion showed rapid disease progression.

Hypoxic regions are frequently found in glioblastoma, and increased levels of hypoxia are associated with poor clinical outcomes of glioblastoma patients. Hypoxia plays important roles in the progression and recurrence of glioblastoma because of drug delivery deficiencies and induction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 in tumor cells, which lead to poor prognosis. We focused on a promising hypoxia-targeted internal radiotherapy agent, 64Cu-diacetyl-bis (N4-methylthiosemicarbazone) (64Cu-ATSM), to address the need for additional treatment for glioblastoma. This compound can target the overreduced state under hypoxic conditions within tumors. Clinical positron emission tomography studies using radiolabeled Cu-ATSM have shown that Cu-ATSM accumulates in glioblastoma and its uptake is associated with high hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 expression. To evaluate the therapeutic potential of this agent for glioblastoma, we examined the efficacy of 64Cu-ATSM in mice bearing U87MG glioblastoma tumors. Administration of single dosage (18.5, 37, 74, 111, and 148 MBq) and multiple dosages (37 MBq \u00d7 4) of 64Cu-ATSM was investigated. Single administration of 64Cu-ATSM in high-dose groups dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival, with slight and reverse signs of adverse events. Multiple dosages of 64Cu-ATSM remarkably inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival. By splitting the dose of 64Cu-ATSM, no adverse effects were observed. Our findings indicate that multiple administrations of 64Cu-ATSM have effective antitumor effects in glioblastoma without side effects, indicating its potential for treating this fatal disease.",

Frequently detected somatic mutations included TP53 (68.5%), KDR (41.3%), and PIK3CA (17.4%). Notably, RB1 mutations were the only mutations significantly different between the UBUC and UTUC groups (19.7% vs. 0%, P\u00a0=\u00a0.020). The most common types of CNVs included amplifications (56/62, 90.3%): 17.7% of patients identified amplifications in NOTCH1. We also identified five translocations in the entire study population, including one case with FGFR3-TACC3 (Chr4) fusion. CONCLUSION: Within a small study population, we identified similar genetic alterations in both UTUC and UBUC patients, indicating a basis for similar management strategies.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: In gastric adenocarcinoma (GC), the major tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) such as p16, PTEN, Rb, E-cadherin, and p53, may play important roles in various regulatory pathways and in tumor suppression. This study evaluated the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of microsatellite and protein expression of 5 TSGs and the results were examined for their correlation with clinicopathological factors. METHODS: LOH analysis was carried out using polymerase chain reactions with 15 polymorphic microsatellite markers of 5 chromosomes containing TSGs in 100 surgically resected tumors. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC). RESULTS: LOH was detected in 83% of GCs. LOH of 9p21, 10q23, 13q14, 16q22, and 17p13 were detected in 26%, 31%, 24%, 22%, and 35% of cases, respectively. Protein expression of p16, PTEN, Rb, E-cadherin, and p53 were found to be 31%, 39%, 28%, 32%, and 46% of cases. Advanced GCs showed significantly higher rates of 17p13 LOH and p53 expression. 9p21 LOH and E-cadherin IHC were correlated with higher tumor grade. Lymph node metastasis was correlated with the LOH of 9p21, 16q22, and 17p13 and IHC of the Rb and p53. A higher stage was correlated with 10q23 and 17p13 in LOH and p53 for IHC. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that LOH and protein expression of various TSGs are important in carcinogenesis and tumor invasion. Additionally, LOH and IHC may be useful clinical indicators for determining the prognosis of patients with GCs. In particular, the 17p13 LOH and p53 for IHC can be applied as simple evaluations in the clinic.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight breast cancer patients, with a total of 93 lesions, were included in our study. Pre\u2013 and post\u2013last chemotherapy, size and total hemoglobin concentration (THC) of each lesion were measured by conventional US and US-guided DOT 1 day before biopsy (time point t0, THC THC0, SIZE S0) and 1 to 2 days before surgery (time point tL, THCL, SL). The relative changes in THC and SIZE of lesions after the first and last NAC cycles were considered as the variables \u0394THC and \u0394SIZE. Receiver operating characteristic curve was performed to calculate \u0394THC and \u0394SIZE cutoff values to evaluate pathologic response of 93 breast cancers to NAC, which were then prospectively used to predicate response of 61 breast cancers to NAC. RESULTS: The cutoff values of \u0394THC and \u0394SIZE for evaluation of breast cancers NAC treatment response were 23.9% and 42.6%. At \u0394THC 23.9%, the predicted treatment response in 61 breast lesions for the time points t1 to t3 was calculated by area under the curve (AUC), which were AUC1 0.534 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.6668), AUC2 0.604 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.1893), and AUC3 0.674(P =. 0.027), respectively; for \u0394SIZE 42.6%, at time points t1 to t3, AUC1 0.505 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.9121), AUC2 0.645 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0115), and AUC3 0.719 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0018).

METHODS: From May 2008 to March 2014, 3022 newly histology-proven, nonmetastatic NPC patients were retrospectively reviewed; among them, 257 patients treated with h-R3 were enrolled in this study. The patients' age range was between 10 and 76 years. The distribution of patients by disease stage was 150 (58.4%) in stage III, 88 (34.2%) in stage IV A, and 19 (7.4%) in stage IV B. All the patients received the treatment of h-R3 plus IMRT, and from them, 239 cases were also treated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Acute and late radiation-related toxicities were graded according to the Acute and Late Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. The accumulated survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Log-rank test was used to compare the survival difference. Multivariate analysis was performed using Cox's proportional-hazard model. RESULTS: All 257 patients had completed combined treatment; 231 patients received h-R3 plus IMRT with induction chemotherapy (IC), while 26 patients received only h-R3 plus IMRT. With a median follow-up of 48 months (range, 13-75 months), the estimated 5-year local recurrence-free survival, regional recurrence-free survival, distant metastases-free survival, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) rates were 94.3%, 94.8%, 91.9%, 83.4%, and 86.2%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that age, T stage, clinical stage, and IC were related with OS. Multivariate analysis indicated that T stage and IC were independent prognostic factors for OS. The incidence of grade 3 to 4 acute mucositis and leukocytopenia was 10.9% and 19.8%, respectively, with no cases of skin rash and infusion reaction. Xerostomia was the most common late complication, and the degree of dry mouth in most survivors was mild to moderate at the last follow-up time. CONCLUSION: h-R3 plus IMRT with or without chemotherapy showed promising outcomes in terms of locoregional control and survival without increasing the incidence of radiation-related toxicities for patients.",

In this study, we investigated inhibitory effects of HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells expressing Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase (CD) and human interferon-\u03b2 (IFN-\u03b2) genes in intravenously (i.v.) injected mice with a metastasis model. In this treatment, pro-drug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) is converted to cytotoxic drug 5-fluorouracil by hNSCs expressing the CD gene, which inhibits DNA synthesis in cancer cells. Moreover, IFN-\u03b2 induces apoptosis and reduces the growth of cancer cells. Upon MTT assay, proliferation of choriocarcinoma (JEG-3) cells decreased when co-cultured with hNSCs expressing CD and IFN-\u03b2 genes. To confirm the cancer-tropic effect of these stem cells, chemoattractant factors (VEGF, CXCR4, and C-kit) secreted from JEG-3 cells were identified by polymerase chain reaction. hNSCs migrate toward JEG-3 cells due to ligand-receptor interactions of these factors. Accordingly, the migration capability of hNSCs toward JEG-3 cells was confirmed using an in vitro Trans-well assay, in vivo subcutaneously (s.c.) injected mice groups (xenograft model), and metastasis model. Intravenously injected hNSCs migrated freely to other organs when compared to s.c. injected hNSCs. Thus, we confirmed the inhibition of lung and ovarian metastasis of choriocarcinoma by i.v. injected HB1.F3.CD or HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells in the presence of 5-FC. Treatment of these stem cells also increased the survival rates of mice. In conclusion, this study showed that metastatic cancer was diminished by genetically engineered hNSCs and noncytotoxic drug 5-FC. This is the first report of the therapeutic potential of i.v. injected hNSCs in a metastasis model; therefore, the results indicate that this stem cell therapy can be used as an alternative novel tool to treat metastatic choriocarcinoma.",

Because of their poor prognosis, new therapeutic strategies are needed. Oncolytic virotherapy (OV) is a promising strategy for treating cancer that incorporates both direct viral replication mediated and immune mediated mechanisms to kill tumor cells. C134 is a next generation \u0394\u03b3134.5 oHSV-1 with improved intratumoral viral replication. It remains safe in the CNS environment by inducing early IFN signaling which restricts its replication in non-malignant cells. We sought to identify how C134 performed in an immunocompetent tumor model that restricts its replication advantage over first generation viruses. To achieve this we identified tumors that have intact IFN signaling responses that restrict C134 and first generation virus replication similarly. Our results show that both viruses elicit a T cell mediated anti-tumor effect and improved animal survival but that subtle difference exist between the viruses effect on median survival despite equivalent in vivo viral replication. To further investigate this we examined the anti-tumor activity in immunodeficient mice and in syngeneic models with re-challenge. These studies show that the T cell response is integral to C134 replication independent anti-tumor response and that OV therapy elicits a durable and circulating anti-tumor memory. The studies also show that repeated intratumoral administration can extend both OV anti-tumor effects and induce durable anti-tumor memory that is superior to tumor antigen exposure alone.",

METHODS: The study included 180 patients diagnosed as of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with their pre-therapy computed tomography (CT) scans. Using a radiomic method, 485 features that reflect the heterogeneity and phenotype of tumors were extracted. Afterwards, these radiomic features were used for predicting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status by a least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based on multivariable logistic regression. As a result, we found that radiomic features have prognostic ability in EGFR mutation status prediction. In addition, we used radiomic nomogram and calibration curve to test the performance of the model. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that the radiomic features had the potential to build a prediction model for EGFR mutation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the training cohort was 0.8618, and the AUC for the validation cohort was 0.8725, which were superior to prediction model that used clinical variables alone. CONCLUSION: Radiomic features are better predictors of EGFR mutation status than conventional semantic CT image features or clinical variables to help doctors to decide who need EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment.",

While plasma cytokine levels have been correlated with other forms of radiation-induced toxicity, their association with RE has been less well studied. We analyzed data from 126 patients treated on 4 prospective clinical trials. Logistic regression models based on combinations of dosimetric factors [maximum dose to 2 cubic cm (D2cc) and generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD)], clinical variables, and pretreatment plasma levels of 30 cytokines were developed. Cross-validated estimates of area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and log likelihood were used to assess prediction accuracy. Dose-only models predicted grade 3 RE with AUC values of 0.750 (D2cc) and 0.727 (gEUD). Combining clinical factors with D2cc increased the AUC to 0.779. Incorporating pretreatment cytokine measurements, modeled as direct associations with RE and as potential interactions with the dose-esophagitis association, produced AUC values of 0.758 and 0.773, respectively. D2cc and gEUD correlated with grade 3 RE with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.094/Gy and 1.096/Gy, respectively. Female gender was associated with a higher risk of RE, with ORs of 1.09 and 1.112 in the D2cc and gEUD models, respectively. Older age was associated with decreased risk of RE, with ORs of 0.992/year and 0.991/year in the D2cc and gEUD models, respectively. Combining clinical with dosimetric factors but not pretreatment cytokine levels yielded improved prediction of grade 3 RE compared to prediction by dose alone.

Herein, we report the expression pattern and clinical relevance of Par3, Par6\u03b2, and PKC\u03b6 in colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC). A total of 393 primary CRACs, 41 primary-metastatic CRAC pairs, 41 adenomas with low-grade dysplasia, and 41 nontumor colorectal tissue samples were examined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays for Par3, Par6\u03b2, and PKC\u03b6 protein expressions. The association Par3, Par6\u03b2, and PKC\u03b6 expressions and clinicopathologic factors, including patient survival, was evaluated. Primary CRACs and adenomas demonstrated higher levels of Par3, Par6\u03b2, and PKC\u03b6 than in nontumor colorectal epithelia. The expressions of Par3, Par6\u03b2, and PKC\u03b6 were higher in primary CRACs as compared to adenomas or in metastatic CRACs. Among primary CRACs, decreased Par3 expression was found to correlate with a high proliferation rate and poor histologic differentiation, decreased PKC\u03b6 expression was correlated with pathologic TNM stage (I-II vs III-IV) and lymph node metastasis, and decreased Par6\u03b2 and PKC\u03b6 expressions were correlated with shortened overall survivals.

The aim of this study was to find a subset of markers that may allow the identification of patients at risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma, and to determine genes differentially expressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. METHODS: Laser capture microdissection technique was applied to procure cells from defined regions. Genome-wide RNA profiling was performed on esophageal adenocarcinoma (n = 21), Barrett's esophagus (n = 20), esophageal squamous carcinoma (n = 9) and healthy esophageal biopsies (n = 18) using the Affymetrix Human Genome U133plus 2.0 array. Microarray results were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in a second and independent cohort and by immunohistochemistry of two putative markers in a third independent cohort. RESULTS: Through unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis, samples were separated into four distinct groups that match perfectly with histology. Many genes down-regulated in esophageal cancers belong to the epidermal differentiation complex or the related GO-group \u201ccornified envelope\u201d of terminally differentiated keratinocytes. Similarly, retinol metabolism was strongly down-regulated. Genes showing strong overexpression in esophageal carcinomas belong to the GO groups extracellular region /matrix such as MMP1, CTHRC1, and INHBA. According to an analysis of genes strongly up-regulated in both esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett's esophagus, REG4 might be of particular interest as an early marker for esophageal adenocarcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides high quality data, which could serve for identification of potential biomarkers of Barrett's esophagus at risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma progression.",

The effect of low-dose docetaxel (DTX) treatment on DC maturation was examined in an ex vivo study, and a phase I clinical trial of combination therapy with direct peritumoral immature DC (iDC) injection with OK-432 and low-dose cyclophosphamide (CTX) plus DTX was designed. Low-dose DTX did not negatively affect iDC viability and instead promoted maturation and IL-12 production. Five patients with metastatic or recurrent HNC were enrolled for the trial. All patients experienced grade 1 to 3 fevers. Intriguingly, elevated CD8+ effector T-cells and reduced Tregs were observed in four patients who completed two treatment cycles. All patients were judged to have progressive disease, but tumor regressions were observed in a subset of targeted metastatic lesions in two of five patients.

The three SFs (in pellets of PE) and conventional tumor markers were analyzed using PE samples in patients with PE (N = 336). The sum of higher\u2013molecular weight (Mw) forms of HNRNPA1 (Sum-HMws-HNRNPA1) and SRSF1 (Sum-HMws-SRSF1) and SRSF3 levels were upregulated in malignant PE (MPE) compared to benign PE (BPE); they were highest in cytology-positive MPE, followed by tuberculous PE and parapneumonic PE.

Sum-HMws-HNRNPA1, Sum-HMws-SRSF1, and SRSF3, but neither LMw-HNRNPA1 nor LMw-SRSF1, showed positive correlations with cancer cell percentages in MPE. The detection accuracy for MPE was high in the order of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA, 85%), Sum-HMws-HNRNPA1 (76%), Sum-HMws-SRSF1 (68%), SRSF3, cytokeratin-19 fragments (CYFRA 21-1), LMw-HNRNPA1, and LMw-SRSF1.

This study is to assess miRNAs expression profiles for identifying brain metastasis-related miRNAs to develop the predictive model by microarray in tumor tissues. METHODS: For this study, we screened the significant brain metastasis-related miRNAs from 77 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with brain metastasis (BM+) or non-brain metastasis (BM\u2212). A predictive model was developed from the training set (n\u00a0=\u00a042) using a random Forest supervised classification algorithm and a Class Centered Method, and then validated in a test set (n\u00a0=\u00a035) and further analysis in GSE62182 (n\u00a0=\u00a073). The independence of this signature in BM prediction was measured by multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: From the training set, the predictive model (including hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-214 and hsa-miR-15a) stratified the patients into two groups with significantly different BM subtypes (90.4% of accuracy). The similar predictive power (91.4% of accuracy) was obtained in the test cohort. As an independent predictive factor, it was closely associated with BM and had high sensitivity and specificity in predicting BM in clinical practice. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that this signature involved in the signaling pathways positively correlated with cancer metastasis. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that the three-miRNA signature could develop a new random Forest model to predict the BM of LUAD patients. These findings emphasized the importance of miRNAs in diagnosing BM, and provided evidence for selecting treatment decisions and designing clinical trials.",

HNSCC has traditionally been associated with alcohol and nicotine use, but more recently the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) has emerged as a favorable prognostic risk factor for oropharyngeal HNSCC. However, further stratification with additional biomarkers to predict patient outcome continues to be essential. One candidate biomarker is the DEK oncogenic protein, which was previously detected in the urine of patients with bladder cancer and is known to be secreted by immune cells such as macrophages. Here, we investigated if DEK could be detected in human plasma and if DEK levels correlated with clinical and pathological variables of HNSCC. Plasma was separated from the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed, untreated HNSCC patients or age-matched normal healthy controls and analyzed for DEK protein using ELISA. Plasma concentrations of DEK protein were lower in p16-negative tumors compared to both normal controls and patients with p16-positive tumors. Patients with lower plasma concentrations of DEK were also more likely to have late stage tumors and a lower white blood cell count. Contrary to previously published work demonstrating a poor prognosis with high intratumoral DEK levels, we show for the first time that decreased concentrations of DEK in patient plasma correlates with poor prognostic factors, including HPV-negative status as determined by negative p16 expression and advanced tumor stage.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most tumor cell lines exhibited low-dose hyperradiosensitivity (LDHRS) to radiation doses lower than 0.3 Gy. Pulsed low\u2013dose rate radiotherapy (PLDR) took advantage of LDHRS and maximized the tumor control process. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed patients receiving PLDR for refractory malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 22 patients were included in our study: 9 females and 13 males. The median age was 61 years old. All the patients previously received multiline treatments and failed with an estimated survival less than 6 months. Thus, palliative PLDR was given. The PLDR was delivered using 10 fractions of 2 Gy/day, with an interval of 3 minutes, for 5 days per week. The dose rate was 6.67 cGy/min. The median follow-up was 1 year (range 8-30 months). Nine patients underwent PLDR for reirradiation due to locally recurrent diseases. The time interval from last irradiation was 11 to 168 months. Ten patients received PLDR due to poor performance status. Three patients were given PLDR for bulky tumor. The irradiated sites included primary disease (seven patients), locally recurrent disease (nine patients), and retroperitoneal adenopathy (six patients). RESULTS: Five patients developed grade 3 or 4 toxicities. No grade 5 toxicities occurred. All the toxicities recovered after treatments. In general, the 1-year local-regional control rate was approximately 40%, and almost all the patients developed progression at the second year after PLDR. The 6-month survival rate was 76%, and the 1-year survival rate was 69%. For the three patients given PLDR for bulky tumor, all of them achieved partial remission 1 month after the PLDR, and one patient achieved complete response at the fourth month. CONCLUSION: PLDR is an effective and safe option not only for reirradiation but also for patients with poor performance status or bulky tumors. A prospective clinical trial (NCT03061162) is ongoing to validate our results.",

However, whether IFN-\u03b3 is involved in the regulation of gastric cancer has not been well elucidated. Herein, we aimed to investigate the effects and mechanism of IFN-\u03b3 on gastric cancer. In this study, we found a vital role of IFN-\u03b3 in enhancing proliferation, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting cell migration and invasion in gastric cancer cells SGC-7901 and MGC-803. Additionally, IFN-\u03b3 activated nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) signaling pathway by upregulating the phosphorylation expression of p65 and I\u03baB\u03b1, and induced the expression of integrin \u03b23 in vitro. Therefore, to further investigate the relationship between IFN-\u03b3 and integrin \u03b23, SGC-7901 cells were transfected with integrin \u03b23 siRNA. And then cells expressed lower cell viability, migration, and invasion rates, while cell apoptosis was significantly enhanced. Meanwhile, expression of integrin \u03b23, MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-\u03baB, including p65 and I\u03baB\u03b1, and the nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB/p65 were dramatically repressed, whereas IFN-\u03b3 significantly improved the effects. Moreover, in vivo, the experiment of xenograft model and pulmonary metastasis model also retarded in integrin \u03b23 siRNA group. And the expression of integrin \u03b23, MMP-2, MMP-9, and NF-\u03baB was repressed. However, the treatment with IFN-\u03b3 improved tumor volume, lung/total weight, tumor nodules, and the protein expression described above compared with integrin \u03b23 siRNA group. Overall, the results indicated that IFN-\u03b3 induces gastric cancer cell proliferation and metastasis partially through the upregulation of integrin \u03b23-mediated NF-\u03baB signaling. Hence, the inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 or integrin \u03b23 may be the key for the treatment of gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "Melanoma is a cancer that exhibits one of the most aggressive and heterogeneous features. The incidence rate escalates. A high number of clones harboring various mutations contribute to an exceptional level of intratumor heterogeneity of melanoma. It also refers to metastases which may originate from different subclones of primary lesion. Such component of the neoplasm biology is termed intertumor and intratumor heterogeneity. These levels of tumor heterogeneity hinder accurate diagnosis and effective treatment. The increasing number of research on the topic reflects the need for understanding limitation or failure of contemporary therapies. Majority of analyses concentrate on mutations in cancer-related genes. Novel high-throughput techniques reveal even higher degree of variations within a lesion. Consolidation of theories and researches indicates new routes for treatment options such as targets for immunotherapy. The demand for personalized approach in melanoma treatment requires extensive knowledge on intratumor and intertumor heterogeneity on the level of genome, transcriptome/proteome, and epigenome. Thus, achievements in exploration of melanoma variety are described in details. Particularly, the issue of tumor heterogeneity or homogeneity given BRAF mutations is discussed.",

Here, we studied a possible association of BNIP3 expression and the prognosis of patients with renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) and examined the functional relevance of BNIP3 in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis of renal carcinoma cells. BNIP3 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in RCC tumor tissue samples of 569 patients using a tissue microarray. Functional characterization of BNIP3 in renal carcinoma cells indicates prosurvival effects. In human RCC tumor samples, high cytoplasmic BNIP3 expression was associated with high-grade RCCs and regional lymph node metastasis. BNIP3 expression correlated negatively with disease-specific survival. Multivariate Cox regression analysis retained BNIP3 expression as an independent prognostic factor in patients without distant metastasis. Together, our studies imply that BNIP3 regulates cell survival in RCCs and its expression is an independent prognostic marker in patients with localized RCCs.",

     "abstract": "Cervical cancer is the third most common cancer in women worldwide. However, the underlying mechanism of occurrence and development of cervical cancer is obscure. In this study, we observed that miR-30e was downregulated in clinical cervical cancer tissues and cervical cancer cells. Next, overexpression of miR-30e reduced the cervical cancer cell growth through MTT, colony formation, EdU, and Transwell assay in SiHa and Caski cells. Subsequently, UDP-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine: polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 7 (GALNT7) was identified as a potential miR-30e target by bioinformatics analysis. Moreover, we showed that miR-30e was able to bind to the 3\u2032UTR of GALNT7 by luciferase reporter assay. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of GALNT7 in cervical cancer cells were downregulated by miR-30e. And we validated that downregulation of GALNT7 repressed the proliferation of SiHa and Caski cells by MTT, colony formation, and Transwell assay. We identified that the restoration of GALNT7 expression was able to counteract the effect of miR-30e on cell proliferation of cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, we found that the expression levels of GALNT7 were frequently upregulated and negatively correlative to those of miR-30e in cervical cancer tissues. In addition, we validated that restoration of GALNT7 rescued the miR-30e\u2013suppressed growth of cervical cancer xenografts in vivo. In conclusion, the current results suggest that miR-30e may function as tumor suppressors in cervical cancer through downregulation of GALNT7. Both miR-30e and its novel target, GALNT7, may play an important role in the process of cervical cancer.",

METHOD: We enrolled 588 NSCLC patients from three independent cohorts. Two sets of 463 patients from two different institutes were used as the training cohort. The remaining cohort with 125 patients was set as the validation cohort. A total of 1014 radiomics features (507 2D features and 507 3D features correspondingly) were assessed. Based on the dichotomized survival data, 2D and 3D radiomics indicators were calculated for each patient by trained classifiers. We used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess the prediction performance of trained classifiers (the support vector machine and logistic regression). Kaplan\u2013Meier and Cox hazard survival analyses were also employed. Harrell's concordance index (C-Index) and Akaike's information criteria (AIC) were applied to assess the trained models. RESULTS: Radiomics indicators were built and compared by AUCs. In the training cohort, 2D_AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.653, 3D_AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.671. In the validation cohort, 2D_AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.755, 3D_AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.663. Both 2D and 3D trained indicators achieved significant results (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05) in the Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression. In the validation cohort, 2D Cox model had a C-Index\u00a0=\u00a00.683 and AIC\u00a0=\u00a0789.047; 3D Cox model obtained a C-Index\u00a0=\u00a00.632 and AIC\u00a0=\u00a0799.409. CONCLUSION: Both 2D and 3D CT radiomics features have a certain prognostic ability in NSCLC, but 2D features showed better performance in our tests. Considering the cost of the radiomics features calculation, 2D features are more recommended for use in the current study.",

Because non-enhancing GBM (Enh\u2212) challenges clinical patient management as latent disease, this study sought to characterize ex vivo metabolic profiles from Enh\u2212 and CE GBM (Enh+) samples, alongside histological and in vivo MR parameters, to assist in defining criteria for estimating total tumor burden. Methods: Fifty-six patients with newly diagnosed GBM received a multi-parametric pre-surgical MR examination. Targets for obtaining image-guided tissue samples were defined based on in vivo parameters that were suspicious for tumor. The actual location from where tissue samples were obtained was recorded, and half of each sample was analyzed for histopathology while the other half was scanned using HR-MAS spectroscopy. Results: The Enh+ and Enh\u2212 tumor samples demonstrated comparable mitotic activity, but also significant heterogeneity in microvascular morphology. Ex vivo spectroscopic parameters indicated similar levels of total choline and N-acetylaspartate between these contrast-based radiographic subtypes of GBM, and characteristic differences in the levels of myo-inositol, creatine/phosphocreatine, and phosphoethanolamine. Analysis of in vivo parameters at the sample locations were consistent with histological and ex vivo metabolic data. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity between ex vivo levels of choline and NAA, and between in vivo levels of choline, NAA and nADC in Enh+ and Enh\u2212 tumor, indicate that these parameters can be used in defining non-invasive metrics of total tumor burden for patients with GBM.",

METHODS: This study included female patients age >40 years with malignant breast lesions identified on contrast-enhanced CBBCT. Contrast enhancement of malignant breast lesions was standardized to breast fat tissue contrast enhancement. All breast lesions were approved via image-guided biopsy or surgery. Immunohistochemical staining was conducted for expression of estrogen (ER), progesterone (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and Ki-67 index. Contrast enhancement of breast lesions was correlated with immunohistochemical breast cancer subtypes (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 positive, triple negative), receptor status and Ki-67 expression. RESULTS: Highest contrast enhancement was seen for Luminal A lesions (93.6 HU) compared to Luminal B lesions (47.6 HU, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002), HER2 positive lesions (83.5 HU, P\u00a0=\u00a0.359) and triple negative lesions (45.3 HU, P\u00a0=\u00a0.005). Contrast enhancement of HER2 positive lesions was higher than Luminal B lesions (P\u00a0=\u00a0.044) and triple negative lesions (P\u00a0=\u00a0.039). No significant difference was evident between Luminal B and triple negative lesions (P\u00a0=\u00a0.439). Lesions with high Ki-67 index showed lower contrast enhancement than those with low Ki-67 index (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0043). ER, PR and HER2 positive lesions demonstrated higher contrast enhancement than their receptor negative counterparts, although differences did not reach statistical significance (P\u00a0=\u00a0.1714; P\u00a0=\u00a0.3603; P\u00a0=\u00a0.2166). CONCLUSIONS: Contrast enhancement of malignant breast lesions on CBBCT correlates with immunohistochemical subtype and proliferative potential.

Novel imaging techniques are able to further characterize tumors and even predict histopathology features. Texture analysis is an emergent imaging technique to extract extensive data from an radiology images. The present study was therefore conducted to identify possible associations between texture analysis and histopathology parameters in thyroid cancer. METHODS: The radiological database was retrospectively reviewed for thyroid carcinoma. Overall, 13 patients (3 females, 23.1%) with a mean age of 61.6 years were identified. The MaZda program was used for texture analysis. The T1-precontrast and T2-weighted images were analyzed and overall 279 texture feature for each sequence was investigated. For every patient cell count, Ki67-index and p53 count were investigated. RESULTS: Several significant correlations between texture features and histopathology were identified. Regarding T1-weighted images, S(0;1)Sum Averg correlated the most with cell count (r\u00a0=\u00a00.82). An inverse correlations with S(5;0)AngScMom, S(5;0)DifVarnc S(5;0), DiffEntrp and GrNonZeros (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.69, \u22120.66, \u22120.69 and \u22120.63, respectively) was also identified. For T2-weighted images, Variance with r\u00a0=\u00a00.63 was the highest coefficient, WavEnLL_S3 correlated inversely with cell count (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.57). WavEnLL_S2 derived from T1-weighted images was the highest coefficient r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.80, S(0;5)SumVarnc was positively with r\u00a0=\u00a00.74. Regarding T2-weighted images WavEnHL_s-1 was inverse correlated with Ki67 index (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.77). S(1;0)Correlat was with r\u00a0=\u00a00.75 the best correlation with Ki67 index. For T1-weighed images S(5;0)SumofSqs was the best with r\u00a0=\u00a00.65 with p53 count. For T2-weighted images S(1;\u22121)SumEntrp was the inverse correlation with r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.72, whereas S(0;4)AngScMom correlated positively with r\u00a0=\u00a00.63.

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common neoplasms, and metastasis is the most important feature for HCC-related deaths. Mounting evidence implies the dynamic regulatory role of SIRT2, a histone deacetylase, in cancer cells. Unfortunately, the role of SIRT2 and the antitumor activity of its inhibition are not known in HCC. The present study aims to evaluate the biological function of SIRT2 in HCC and identify the target of SIRT2 as well as evaluate its therapeutic efficacy. We found that SIRT2 was upregulated in HCC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and this was correlated with reduced patient survival. Although CCK8 and colony-formation assays showed that SIRT2 inhibiton marginally promotes proliferation in HCC cell lines, SIRT2 knockdown decreased the invasion of HCC cells. We demonstrated that downregulation of SIRT2 could inhibit its downstream target phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 and glutaminase, which is related to mitochondrial metabolism and the E-Cadherin pathway. These results demonstrate, for the first time that downregulation of SIRT2 decreases migration as well as invasion in human HCC cells, indicating that inhibiting SIRT2 may be an effective therapeutic strategy for treating HCC.",

     "abstract": "Premenopausal breast cancer is associated with increased animal fat consumption among normal-weight but not overweight women. Our previous findings in obesity-resistant BALB/c mice showed that a diet high in saturated animal fat (HFD) promotes mammary tumorigenesis in both DMBA carcinogenesis and Trp53-null transplant models. Having made these observations in BALB/c mice, which have very modest HFD weight gain, we determined the effects of HFD in FVB mice, which gain significant weight on HFD. Three-week-old FVB mice fed a low-fat diet or HFD were subjected to 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene-induced carcinogenesis. Like BALB/c mice, HFD promoted mammary tumorigenesis. Development of tumors largely occurred prior to mice becoming obese, indicating the role of animal-derived HFD rather than resulting obesity in tumor promotion. Also similar to BALB/c mice, early-occurring adenosquamous mammary tumors were abundant among HFD-fed FVB mice. Tumors from HFD mice also had increased intra-tumor M2 macrophages. Prior to tumor development, HFD accelerated normal mammary gland development and increased mammary M2 macrophages, similarly to BALB/c mice. The promotional effects of puberty-initiated HFD on carcinogen-induced mammary cancer are thus largely weight gain-independent. Like BALB/c mice, HFD promoted adenosquamous tumors, suggesting a role for early age HFD in promoting this subtype of triple negative mammary cancer. M2 macrophage recruitment was common to both mouse strains. We speculate that a similar effect of HFD on immune function may contribute to epidemiological findings of increased breast cancer risk in young, premenopausal, normal-weight women who consume a diet high in saturated animal fat.",

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of the associations. We performed a meta-analysis to further evaluate the associations. Furthermore, we calculated the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) to assess which gene/genes may better predict neuroblastoma risk. We confirmed that CASC15 rs6939340 A\u00a0>\u00a0G, rs4712653 T\u00a0>\u00a0C, rs9295536 C\u00a0>\u00a0A, LIN28B rs221634 A\u00a0>\u00a0T, and LMO1 rs110419 A\u00a0>\u00a0G were associated with significantly altered neuroblastoma susceptibility.

The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of pretreatment biomarkers on disease-specific survival (DSS) adjusted for confounders. METHODS: The study included 818 patients with localized STS. Pretreatment levels of albumin, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, neutrophils, and lymphocytes were tested individually and combined in prognostic scores: neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS), and Aarhus Composite Biomarker Score (ACBS) which includes all five biomarkers. Patients were randomly split into a test cohort and a validation cohort. The prognostic value of biomarkers on DSS was estimated using crude and adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. The different biomarker scores were compared using Akaike's information criteria. RESULTS: In the test cohort of 403 patients, all biomarkers except lymphocyte count were significant prognostic factors for DSS also after adjusting for confounders. NLR, GPS, and ACBS were independently associated with decreased survival; however, ACBS was significantly superior to NLR (P\u00a0=\u00a0.02) and GPS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). These findings were validated in the randomly assigned validation cohort of 415 patients. In the pooled data of 818 patients, the ACBS performed better than GPS and NLR. ACBS 2 was independently associated with decreased DSS compared to ACBS 0, hazard ratio 2.3[95% confidence interval: 1.5-3.5], P\u00a0<\u00a0.001. CONCLUSION: Patients with abnormal values in more than one serum biomarkers had a significant additional risk of dying compared to patients with only one abnormal value.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: From March 2006 to January 2016, 147 patients who met the inclusion criteria were enrolled; 27 patients received sorafenib, and 17 patients received sunitinib. After radical nephrectomy and thrombectomy, the duration of maintenance targeted medication treatment was approximately 1 year. The primary objective was to compare disease-free survival (DFS) between each experimental group and control. Secondary end points included overall survival (OS) and toxic effects. RESULTS: The three groups were well balanced in terms of age, body mass index, gender, performance status, medical history, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, surgical approach, and tumor side and size. However, more patients receiving adjuvant therapy had inferior vena cava tumor thrombus. DFS and OS did not differ significantly between groups (P\u00a0=\u00a0.459 and .871, respectively). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, results of multivariate analysis proved that postoperative adjuvant therapy was not an independent factor for predicting DFS and OS (P\u00a0>\u00a0.05 for both). The subgroup analyses for inferior vena cava tumor thrombus found similar results. The common adverse events were hand-foot syndrome, diarrhea, fatigue, and neutropenia. The adverse effects were mild in both groups, and the incidence was not significantly different between sorafenib and sunitinib. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant treatment postoperatively with sorafenib or sunitinib showed no survival benefit relative to control for patients with nonmetastatic RCC and VTT in a prospective cohort study.",

In this study, we will identify the surface markers and stem cell markers related with cancer stem cells (CSCs) of EC. Tissue samples were obtained from endometrial cancer patients during surgical procedures. Single cells were isolated from the tissues for culturing, transfection into nude mice, and histopathology analysis. RT-PCR demonstrated that the cultured cells strongly expressed stemness-related genes, such as c-Myc, Sox-2, Nanog, Oct 4A, ABCG2, BMI-1, CK-18, Nestin and \u03b2-actin. The expression of surface markers CD24, CD133, CD47, CD29, CD44, CXCR4, SSEA3 and SSEA4, CD24, and CD133 and chemokine markers such as CXCR4 were measured by flow cytometry. Then the double percentage of CD133+CXCR4+ cells constituted 7.2% and 9.3% in EC cells originated from two different patients, respectively. The CD133+CXCR4+ primary endometrial cancer cells grew faster, exhibited high expression of mRNA of stemness-related genes, produced more spheres, and had higher clonogenic ability than other subpopulations. They are also more resistant to anti-cancer drugs than other subpopulations. These findings indicate that CD133+CXCR4+ cells may possess some characteristics of CSCs in primary endometrial cancer. These cell surface markers may be useful for the development of drugs against CSC molecular targets or as a predictive marker for poor prognosis in primary endometrial cancer.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mounting evidence suggests that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are closely related to pathological complete response (pCR) in neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer. Here, we construct lncRNA associated models to predict pCR rate. METHODS: LncRNA expression profiles of breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus by repurposing existing microarray data. The prediction model was firstly built by analyzing the correlation between pCR and lncRNA expression in the discovery dataset GSE 25066 (n\u00a0=\u00a0488). Another three independent datasets, GSE20194 (n\u00a0=\u00a0278), GSE20271 (n\u00a0=\u00a0178), and GSE22093 (n\u00a0=\u00a097), were integrated as the validation cohort to assess the prediction efficiency. RESULTS: A novel lncRNA signature (LRS) consisting of 36 lncRNAs was identified. Based on this LRS, patients with NAC treatment were divided into two groups: LRS-high group and LRS-low group, with positive correlation of pCR rate in the discovery dataset. In the validation cohort, univariate and multivariate analyses both demonstrated that high LRS was associated with higher pCR rate. Subgroup analysis confirmed that this model performed well in luminal B [odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a05.4; 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a02.7-10.8; P\u00a0=\u00a01.47e-06], HER2-enriched (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.5; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.1-5.7; P\u00a0=\u00a0.029), and basal-like (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.5; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.3-16.2; P\u00a0=\u00a05.32e-04) subtypes. Compared with other preexisting prediction models, LRS demonstrated better performance with higher area under the curve. Functional annotation analysis suggested that lncRNAs in this signature were mainly involved in cancer proliferation process. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicated that our lncRNA signature was sensitive to predict pCR rate in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer, which deserves further evaluation.",

     "abstract": "A novel full-inversion-based technique for quantitative ultrasound elastography was investigated in a pilot clinical study on five patients for non-invasive detection and localization of prostate cancer and quantification of its extent. Conventional-frequency ultrasound images and radiofrequency (RF) data (~5 MHz) were collected during mechanical stimulation of the prostate using a transrectal ultrasound probe. Pre and post-compression RF data were used to construct the strain images. The Young's modulus (YM) images were subsequently reconstructed using the derived strain images and the stress distribution estimated iteratively using finite element (FE) analysis. Tumor regions determined based on the reconstructed YM images were compared to whole-mount histopathology images of radical prostatectomy specimens. Results indicated that tumors were significantly stiffer than the surrounding tissue, demonstrating a relative YM of 2.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.8 compared to normal prostate tissue. The YM images had a good agreement with the histopathology images in terms of tumor location within the prostate. On average, 76%\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028% of tumor regions detected based on the proposed method were inside respective tumor areas identified in the histopathology images. Results of a linear regression analysis demonstrated a good correlation between the disease extents estimated using the reconstructed YM images and those determined from whole-mount histopathology images (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.71). This pilot study demonstrates that the proposed method has a good potential for detection, localization and quantification of prostate cancer. The method can potentially be used for prostate needle biopsy guidance with the aim of decreasing the number of needle biopsies. The proposed technique utilizes conventional ultrasound imaging system only while no additional hardware attachment is required for mechanical stimulation or data acquisition. Therefore, the technique may be regarded as a non-invasive, low cost and potentially widely-available clinical tool for prostate cancer diagnosis.",

     "abstract": "Many ovarian cancer patients often show peritoneal metastasis with malignant ascites. However, unmet medical needs remain regarding controlling these symptoms after tumors become resistant to chemotherapies. We developed KHK2805, a novel anti-folate receptor \u03b1 (FOLR1) humanized antibody with enhanced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The primary aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the anti-tumor activity of KHK2805 was sufficient for therapeutic application against peritoneal dissemination and malignant ascites of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer in preclinical models. Here, both the ADCC and CDC of KHK2805 were evaluated in ovarian cancer cell lines and patient-derived samples. The anti-tumor activity of KHK2805 was evaluated in a SCID mouse model of platinum-resistant peritoneal dissemination. As results, KHK2805 showed specific binding to FOLR1 with high affinity at a novel epitope. KHK2805 exerted potent ADCC and CDC against ovarian cancer cell lines. Furthermore, primary platinum-resistant malignant ascites cells were susceptible to autologous ADCC with KHK2805. Patient-derived sera and malignant ascites induced CDC of KHK2805. KHK2805 significantly reduced the total tumor burden and amount of ascites in SCID mice with peritoneal dissemination and significantly prolonged their survival. In addition, the parental rat antibody strongly stained serous and clear cell-type ovarian tumors by immunohistochemistry. Overall, KHK2805 showed cytotoxicity against both ovarian cancer cell lines and patient-derived cells. These translational study findings suggest that KHK2805 may be promising as a novel therapeutic agent for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer with peritoneal dissemination and malignant ascites.",

We aimed to identify baseline peripheral blood biomarkers to predict the outcome of acral melanoma patients treated with IFN-\u03b1-2b. Pretreatment baseline parameters and clinical data were assessed in 226 patients with acral melanoma. Relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied after adjusting for stage, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and ulceration.

     "abstract": "Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Current chemotherapy regimens include a combination of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, but more efficient therapy strategies are needed to increase 5-year survival. Alterations in the signaling pathway of the tumor suppressor gene Rb-1, which encodes a phosphoprotein (pRB) that negatively regulates the G1/S transition of the cell cycle, are present in 70% of all tumors, but its role in esophageal cancer is still unclear. Most of these are alterations leading to up-regulation of the activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) to phosphorylate pRB, which suggests that keeping the wild type pRB phosphorylated might be advantageous. Besides proliferation, pRB also regulates apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) and DNA-damage. We investigated the status of phosphorylation of pRB along esophageal tumorigenesis stages, as well as whether hyperphosphorylation of pRB could suppress apoptosis induced by cisplatin, 5-FU, or TNF-\u03b1 in esophageal cancer cells. pRB phosphorylation increased progressively from normal esophageal tissue to metaplasia and adenocarcinoma, suggesting that pRB phosphorylation increases along esophageal tumor stages. When RB-1 was knocked down or CDK inhibitors reduced the levels of phosphorylated pRB, opposite apoptotic effects were observed, depending on the combination of drugs tested: whereas TNF-\u03b1- and cisplatin-induced apoptosis increased, 5-FU-induced apoptosis decreased. Taken together, these data suggest that pRB plays a role in esophageal adenocarcinoma and that, depending on the type of anti-cancer treatment, combining CDK inhibitors and chemotherapy has the potential to increase the sensitivity of esophageal cancer cells to cell death.",

     "abstract": "Chemokines are small soluble molecules that play critical roles in wound healing, infection, and cancer progression. In particular, overexpression of the C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) in multiple cancer types correlates with poor patient prognosis. Animal studies have shown that CCL2 signals to macrophages and breast cancer cells to promote tumor growth, invasion, and metastasis, indicating that CCL2 is a promising therapeutic target. However, the effectiveness of human-specific neutralizing antibodies has not been fully evaluated. Furthermore, controversies remain on the use of neutralizing antibodies to target CCL2 and could be due to mode of drug delivery. Here, we investigated the effects of continuous delivery of human CCL2-neutralizing antibodies on breast cancer progression. Nude mice bearing MCF10CA1d breast tumor xenografts were implanted with osmotic pumps containing control IgG or anti-CCL2 and analyzed for CCL2 levels and tumor progression over 4 weeks. Despite inhibiting CCL2-induced migration in vitro, CCL2-neutralizing antibodies did not significantly affect tumor growth, invasion, macrophage recruitment, or tumor angiogenesis. CCL2 antibodies did not affect murine CCL2 levels but significantly increased human CCL2 levels in circulating blood and tumor interstitial fluid. CCL2-neutralizing antibodies reduced CCL2 levels in cultured cells short term at high concentrations. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis of CCL2 in cultured fibroblasts and breast cancer cells revealed that the neutralizing antibodies sequestered CCL2 in the media. CCL2 levels were restored once the antibodies were removed. These studies reveal limitations in CCL2-neutralizing antibodies as a therapeutic agent, with important implications for translating CCL2 targeting to the clinic.",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: A standardized method for the oral cavity (oral cavity contours, OCC) and a novel method for the mucosal surface (mucosal surface contours, MSC) were developed for the oral mucosa and prospectively applied to the radiation treatment plans of 92 patients treated with concurrent IMRT and chemotherapy for LANPC. Dose\u2013volume histogram (DVH) data were extracted and then toxicity was analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and logistic regression were carried out for both contouring methods. RESULTS: Grade \u22653 acute oral mucosa toxicity occurred to 20.7% (19/92) of patients in the study. A highly significant dose\u2013volume relationship between oral mucosa irradiation and acute oral mucosa toxicity was supported by using both oral cavity and mucosal surface contouring techniques. In logistic regression, body weight loss was an independent factor related to grade \u22653 acute toxicity for OCC and MSC (P\u00a0=\u00a0.017 and 0.005, respectively), and the independent factor of dosimetric parameters for OCC and MSC were V30Gy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003) and V50Gy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003) respectively. In the receiver operating characteristics curve, the areas under V30Gy of the OCC curves was 0.753 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), while the areas under V50Gy of MSC curves was 0.714 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004); the cut-off value was 73.155% (sensitivity, 0.842; specificity, 0.671) and 14.32% (sensitivity, 0.842; specificity, 0.575), respectively. CONCLUSION: DVH analysis of mucosal surface volumes accurately predicts grade \u22653 acute oral mucosa toxicity in patients with LANPC receiving concurrent IMRT and chemotherapy, but in clinical practice the MSC method appears no better than the OCC one.",

     "abstract": "This study was designed to investigate the effect of single-dose radiation therapy (RT) in combination with evofosfamide (TH-302), a hypoxia-activated prodrug, in a pre-clinical model of pancreatic cancer. AsPC1 tumors were implanted orthotopically in the pancreas of nude mice. Tumors were treated with 15 Gy of RT, using a 1 cm diameter field, and delivered as a continuous arc. Image-guidance to center the field on the tumor was based on CT imaging with intraperitoneal contrast. Evofosfamide (100 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered 3 hours before RT. Tumor volumes were measured using ultrasound, and regrowth curves were plotted. Tumor hypoxia and cell proliferation were measured using pimonidazole and the thymidine analog EdU, respectively. In vitro clonogenic assays were performed. Tumors were shown to contain substantial areas of hypoxia, as calculated by percent pimonidazole staining. Evofosfamide was active in these tumors, as demonstrated by a significant reduction in uptake of the thymidine analog EdU. This effect was visible in oxygenated tissue, consistent with the previously reported bystander effects of evofosfamide. RT produced significant regrowth delay, as did evofosfamide. The combination of both agents produced a growth delay that was at least equal to the sum of the two treatments given separately. The improvement in tumor response when evofosfamide is combined with RT supports the hypothesis that hypoxia is a cause of radioresistance in high dose RT for pancreatic cancer. Assessing the efficacy and safety of stereotactic radiation treatment and evofosfamide is warranted in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.",

Nine (25.7%) had discordance between the plasma and tissue results: five had mutations detected only in their tumor tissue (two Y537S, one Y537C, one D538G, and one Y537S/Y537N/D538G), and four had mutations detected only in their plasma (one Y537S, one Y537N, and two Y537S/Y537N/D538G). Furthermore, longitudinal plasma samples from 19 patients were used to assess changes in the presence of ESR1 mutations during treatment. Eleven patients had cfDNA ESR1 mutations over the course of treatment. A total of eight of 11 patients with MBC with cfDNA ESR1 mutations (72.7%) had the polyclonal mutations.

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Oncolytic adenoviruses show promise in targeting gliomas because they do not replicate in normal brain cells. However, clinical responses occur only in a subset of patients. One explanation could be the heterogenic expression level of virus receptors. Another contributing factor could be variable activity of tumor antiviral defenses in different glioma subtypes. METHODS: We established a collection of primary low-passage cell lines from different glioma subtypes (3 glioblastomas, 3 oligoastrocytomas, and 2 oligodendrogliomas) and assessed them for receptor expression and sensitivity to human adenovirus (HAd) serotypes 3, 5, and 11p. To gauge the impact of antiviral defenses, we also compared the infectivity of the oncolytic adenoviruses in interferon (IFN)-pretreated cells with IFN-sensitive Semliki Forest virus (SFV). RESULTS: Immunostaining revealed generally low expression of HAd5 receptor CAR in both primary tumors and derived cell lines. HAd11p receptor CD46 levels were maintained at moderate levels in both primary tumor samples and derived cell lines. HAd3 receptor DSG-2 was reduced in the cell lines compared to the tumors. Yet, at equal multiplicities of infection, the oncolytic potency of HAd5 in vitro in tumor-derived cells was comparable to HAd11p, whereas HAd3 lysed fewer cells than either of the other two HAd serotypes in 72 hours. IFN blocked replication of SFV, while HAds were rather unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Adenovirus receptor levels on glioma-derived cell lines did not correlate with infection efficacy and may not be a relevant indicator of clinical oncolytic potency. Adenovirus receptor analysis should be preferentially performed on biopsies obtained perioperatively.",

In contrast to most IgG-like BsAbs, the two arms in BiHC have different molecular weights, making it easier to separate hetero- or homodimers. BiHC can be expressed in Escherichia coli and purified via Protein A affinity chromatography.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 90 patients with unilateral breast cancer who then received six or eight cycles of NAC before surgery were analyzed retrospectively. BPE was measured in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI at baseline and after 2nd, 4th, and 6th NAC, respectively. Correlation between BPE and tumor size was analyzed, and the association between pathologic complete remission (pCR) and BPE was also analyzed. RESULTS: The BPE of contralateral normal breast showed a constant reduction throughout NAC therapy regardless of the menopausal status (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 in all). Both the BPEs and the changes of BPE in each of the three monitoring points were significantly correlated with those in tumor size (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05 in all), and the reduction of BPE after 2nd NAC had the largest diagnostic value for pCR (AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.726, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), particularly in hormonal receptor (HR)-negative patients (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.243, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a00.083 to 0.706, P\u00a0=\u00a0.009).

RESULTS: In a screen for MDM2 splice variants in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, extended with data from healthy leukocytes, we found P2-MDM2-10 and MDM2-\u03945 to be the splice variants expressed at highest levels. Contrasting MDM2 full-length protein, we found normal tissue expression levels of P2-MDM2-10 and MDM2-\u03945 to be highest in individuals harboring the promoter SNP309TT genotype. While we detected no protein product coded for by MDM2-\u03945, the P2-MDM2-10 variant generated a protein markedly more stable than MDM2-FL. Both splice variants were significantly upregulated in stressed cells (P\u00a0=\u00a04.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 and P\u00a0=\u00a07.1 \u00d7 10\u22124, respectively). Notably, chemotherapy treatment and overexpression of P2-MDM2-10 or MDM2-\u03945 both lead to increased mRNA levels of the endogenous MDM2-FL (P\u00a0=\u00a0.039 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.070, respectively) but also the proapoptotic gene PUMA (P\u00a0=\u00a0.010 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.033, respectively), accompanied by induction of apoptosis and repression of senescence. CONCLUSION: We found P2-MDM2-10 and MDM2-\u03945 to have distinct biological functions in breast cancer cells. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Alternative splicing may influence the oncogenic effects of the MDM2 gene.",

     "abstract": "The oncofetal mRNA-binding protein, IMP1 or insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP1), binds to and stabilizes c-Myc, \u03b2-TrCP1, and other oncogenic mRNAs, leading to increased expression of the proteins encoded by its target mRNAs. IMP1 is frequently overexpressed in cancer and is strongly correlated with a poor prognosis and reduced survival in melanoma, ovarian, breast, colon, and lung cancer. While IMP1 is an attractive anticancer drug target, there are no small molecule inhibitors of IMP1. A fluorescence anisotropy-based assay was used to screen 160,000 small molecules for their ability to inhibit IMP1 binding to fluorescein-labeled c-Myc mRNA. The small molecule, BTYNB, was identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of IMP1 binding to c-Myc mRNA. In cells, BTYNB downregulates several mRNA transcripts regulated by IMP1. BTYNB destabilizes c-Myc mRNA, resulting in downregulation of c-Myc mRNA and protein. BTYNB downregulates \u03b2-TrCP1 mRNA and reduces activation of nuclear transcriptional factors-kappa B (NF-\u03baB). The oncogenic translation regulator, eEF2, emerged as a new IMP1 target mRNA, enabling BTYNB to inhibit tumor cell protein synthesis. BTYNB potently inhibited proliferation of IMP1-containing ovarian cancer and melanoma cells with no effect in IMP1-negative cells. Overexpression of IMP1 reversed BTYNB inhibition of cell proliferation. BTYNB completely blocked anchorage-independent growth of melanoma and ovarian cancer cells in colony formation assays. With its ability to target c-Myc and to inhibit proliferation of difficult-to-target melanomas and ovarian cancer cells, and with its unique mode of action, BTYNB is a promising small molecule for further therapeutic evaluation and mechanistic studies.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Recently, Atuegwu et al. proposed a mathematical model based on ADCmean and ADCmin to calculation of cellularity. Our purpose was to compare the calculated cellularity according to the formula with the estimated cell count by histopathology in different tumors. METHODS: For this study, we re-analyzed our previous data regarding associations between ADC parameters and histopathological findings. Overall, 134 patients with different tumors were acquired for the analysis. For all tumors, the number of tumor cells was calculated according to Atuegwu et al. 2013. We performed a correlation analysis between the calculated and estimated cellularity. Thereby, Pearson's correlation coefficient was used and P < .05 was taken to indicate statistical significance in all instances. RESULTS: The estimated and calculated cellularity correlated well together in HNSCC (r\u00a0=\u00a00.701, P\u00a0=\u00a0.016) and lymphomas (r\u00a0=\u00a00.661, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), and moderately in rectal cancer (r\u00a0=\u00a00.510, P\u00a0=\u00a0.036). There were no statistically significant correlations between the estimated and calculated cellularity in uterine cervical cancer, meningiomas, and in thyroid cancer. CONCLUSION: The proposed formula for cellularity calculation does not apply for all tumors. It may be used for HNSCC, cerebral lymphomas and rectal cancer, but not for uterine cervical cancer, meningioma, and thyroid cancer. Furthermore, its usefulness should be proved for other tumors.",

METHODS: Seventy-four patients with 75 lesions, including 51 malignant FLLs and 24 benign FLLs, underwent liver 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging for routine examination sequences. IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with 11 b values (0-800\u00a0s/mm2) was also acquired concurrently. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADCtotal) and IVIM-derived parameters, such as the pure diffusion coefficient (D), the pseudodiffusion coefficient (D\u204e), and the perfusion fraction (f), were calculated and compared between the two groups. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to assess their diagnostic value. RESULTS: ADCtotal, D, and f were significantly lower in the malignant group than in the benign group, whereas D\u204e did not show a statistical difference. D had a larger area under the curve value (0.968) and higher sensitivity (92.30%) for differentiation. CONCLUSION: IVIM is a useful method to differentiate malignant and benign FLLs.

Noninvasive PAI with co-registered ultrasound (US) was performed to longitudinally monitor tumor growth, oxygen saturation (%sO2), and hemoglobin concentration (HbT). PAI findings were validated with Doppler sonography measures of percent vascularity (PV). Differences in tumor volumes, %sO2, HbT, and PV values over time were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis of variance with multiple comparisons. Two-tailed Spearman correlation analysis was performed to determine the correlation coefficient (r) for comparisons between %sO2, HbT, and tumor volume. US revealed a significant (P < .0001) increase in tumor volume over the 3-week period from 549 \u00b1 260 mm3 on day 7 to 5055 \u00b1 438 mm3 at 21 days postimplantation.

Corresponding Doppler images also showed a decrease in PV over time. PAI revealed considerable intratumoral spatial heterogeneity with the tumor rim showing two- to three-fold higher %sO2 values compared to the core.

     "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are membrane receptors that play a vital role in various biological processes, in particular, cell survival, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation. These cellular processes are composed of multitiered signaling cascades of kinases starting from ligand binding to extracellular domains of RTKs that activate the entire pathways through tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors and downstream effectors. A previous study reported that, based on proteomics data, RTKs were a major candidate target for osteosarcoma. In this study, activation profiles of six candidate RTKs, including c-Met, c-Kit, VEGFR2, HER2, FGFR1, and PDGFR\u03b1, were directly examined from chemonaive fresh frozen tissues of 32 osteosarcoma patients using a multiplex immunoassay. That examination revealed distinct patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation of RTKs in osteosarcoma cases. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering was calculated using Pearson uncentered correlation coefficient to classify RTKs into two groups\u2014Group A (c-Met, c-Kit, VEGFR2, and HER2) and Group B (FGFR1 and PDGFR\u03b1)\u2014based on tyrosine phosphorylation patterns. Nonactivation of all Group A RTKs was associated with shorter overall survival in stage IIB osteosarcoma patients. Percentages of tumor necrosis in patients with inactive Group A RTKs were significantly lower than those in patients with at least one active Group A RTK. Paired primary osteosarcoma cells with fresh osteosarcoma tissue were extracted and cultured for cytotoxicity testing. Primary cells with active Group A RTKs tended to be sensitive to doxorubicin and cisplatin. We also found that osteosarcoma cells with active Group A RTKs were more proliferative than cells with inactive Group A RTKs. These findings indicate that the activation pattern of Group A RTKs is a potential risk stratification and chemoresponse predictor and might be used to guide the optimum chemotherapy regimen for osteosarcoma patients.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: While mutations in PIK3CA are most frequently (45%) detected in luminal breast cancer, downstream PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activation is predominantly observed in the basal subtype. The aim was to identify proteins activated in PIK3CA mutated luminal breast cancer and the clinical relevance of such a protein in breast cancer patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression levels of 171 signaling pathway (phospho-)proteins established by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) were in silico examined in 361 breast cancers for their relation with PIK3CA status. MAPK1/3 phosphorylation was evaluated with immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (TMA) containing 721 primary breast cancer core biopsies to explore the relationship with metastasis-free survival. RESULTS: In silico analyses revealed increased phosphorylation of MAPK1/3, p38 and YAP, and decreased expression of p70S6K and 4E\u2013BP1 in PIK3CA mutated compared to wild-type luminal breast cancer. Augmented MAPK1/3 phosphorylation was most significant, i.e. in luminal A for both PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations and in luminal B for exon 9 mutations. In 290 adjuvant systemic therapy na\u00efve lymph node negative (LNN) breast cancer patients with luminal cancer, high MAPK phosphorylation in nuclei (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.49; 95% CI, 0.25\u20130.95; P\u00a0=\u00a0.036) and in tumor cells (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.37; 95% CI, 0.18\u20130.79; P\u00a0=\u00a0.010) was related with favorable metastasis-free survival in multivariate analyses including traditional prognostic factors. CONCLUSION: Enhanced MAPK1/3 phosphorylation in luminal breast cancer is related to PIK3CA exon-specific mutations and correlated with favorable prognosis especially when located in the nuclei of tumor cells.",

     "abstract": "Atorvastatin is widely used to lower blood cholesterol and to reduce risk of cardiovascular disease\u2013associated complications. Epidemiological investigations and preclinical studies suggest that statins such as atorvastatin have antitumor activity for various types of cancer. Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a tumor syndrome caused by TSC1 or TSC2 mutations that lead to aberrant activation of mTOR and tumor formation in multiple organs. Previous studies have demonstrated that atorvastatin selectively suppressed growth and proliferation of mouse Tsc2 null embryonic fibroblasts through inhibition of mTOR. However, atorvastatin alone did not reduce tumor burden in the liver and kidneys of Tsc2+/\u2212 mice as assessed by histological analysis, and no combination therapy of rapamycin and atorvastatin has been tried. In this study, we used T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging to track changes in tumor number and size in the kidneys of a Tsc1+/\u2212 mouse model and to assess the efficacy of rapamycin and atorvastatin alone and as a combination therapy. We found that rapamycin alone or rapamycin combined with atorvastatin significantly reduced tumor burden, while atorvastatin alone did not. Combined therapy with rapamycin and atorvastatin appeared to be more effective for treating renal tumors than rapamycin alone, but the difference was not statistically significant. We conclude that combined therapy with rapamycin and atorvastatin is unlikely to provide additional benefit over rapamycin as a single agent in the treatment of Tsc-associated renal tumors.",

     "abstract": "Oxaliplatin, in combination with 5-fluorouracil plus folinate (or capecitabine), has increased survival substantially in stage III colorectal cancer and prolonged life in stage IV patients, but its use is compromised because of severe toxicity. Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the most problematic dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin. Oncologists included for years calcium and magnesium infusion as part of clinical practice for preventing CIPN. Results from a phase III prospective study published in 2014, however, overturned this practice. No other treatments have been clinically proven to prevent this toxicity. There is a body of evidence that CIPN is caused by cellular oxidative stress. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that the manganese chelate and superoxide dismutase mimetic mangafodipir (MnDPDP) is an efficacious inhibitor of CIPN and other conditions caused by cellular oxidative stress, without interfering negatively with the tumoricidal activity of chemotherapy. MnPLED, the metabolite of MnDPDP, attacks cellular oxidative stress at several critical levels. Firstly, MnPLED catalyzes dismutation of superoxide (O2\u2022\u2212), and secondly, having a tremendous high affinity for iron (and copper), PLED binds and disarms redox active iron/copper, which is involved in several detrimental oxidative steps. A case report from 2009 and a recent feasibility study suggest that MnDPDP may prevent or even cure oxaliplatin-induced CIPN. Preliminary results from a phase II study (PLIANT) suggest efficacy also of calmangafodipir, but these results are according to available data obscured by a surprisingly low number of adverse events and a seemingly lower than expected efficacy of FOLFOX.",

Owing to its hypervascularity, anti-angiogenic therapies (AAT) have been used as an adjuvant to the traditional surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation. The benefits of AAT have been transient and the tumors were shown to relapse faster and demonstrated particularly high rates of AAT therapy resistance. Alternative neovascularization mechanisms were shown to be at work in these resilient tumors to counter the AAT therapy insult. Vascular Mimicry (VM) is the uncanny ability of tumor cells to acquire endothelial-like properties and lay down vascular patterned networks reminiscent of host endothelial blood vessels. The VM channels served as an irrigation system for the tumors to meet with the increasing metabolic and nutrient demands of the tumor in the event of the ensuing hypoxia resulting from AAT. In our previous studies, we have demonstrated that AAT accelerates VM in GBM. In this review, we will focus on the origins of VM, visualizing VM in AAT-treated tumors and the development of VM as a resistance mechanism to AAT.",

We evaluated the antitumor activity of an FGFR inhibitor in FGFR2-amplified GC patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis. METHODS: Two GC patients with FGFR2 amplification confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization showed peritoneal seeding and malignant ascites. We used the patient-derived xenograft model; patient-derived cells (PDCs) from malignant ascites were used to assess FGFR2 expression and its downstream pathway using immunofluorescence analysis and immunoblot assay in vitro. Apoptosis and cell cycle arrest after treatment of FGFR inhibitor were analyzed by Annexin V-FITC assay and cell cycle analysis. RESULTS: FGFR2 amplification was verified in both PDC lines. AZD4547 as an FGFR inhibitor decreased proliferation of PDCs, and the IC50 value was estimated to be 250 nM in PDC#1 and 210 nM in PDC#2. FGFR inhibitor also significantly decreased levels of phosphorylated FGFR2 and downstream signaling molecules in FGFR2-amplified PDC lines. In cell cycle analysis, apoptosis was significantly increased in AZD4547-treated cells compared with nontreated cells. The proportion of cells in the sub-G1 stage was significantly higher in AZD4547-treated PDCs than in control cells.

We attempted to search for target antigen candidates and antibodies that allowed highly selective gene transduction into malignant tumors. METHODS: Hybridoma libraries producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were screened that increased transduction efficiency in cancer cell lines after cross-linking with Adv-FZ33. Target antigens of the mAbs were identified by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Of these mAbs, we noted a clone, F2-27, that recognized the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2. Next, we generated an adenovirus vector, Ax3CMTK-FZ33, that expressed a herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK). The therapeutic efficacy of F2-27\u2013mediated HSV-TK gene transduction, followed by ganciclovir (GCV) administration, was studied in vitro. The inhibitory effect of F2-27 on cancer cell invasion was investigated by a three-dimensional spheroid formation assay. RESULTS: In vitro reporter gene expression after Adv-FZ33 infection via F2-27 was 146 times higher than with control mAb in EphA2-expressing cancer cell lines. F2-27\u2013mediated Ax3CMTK-FZ33 infection induced the HSV-TK gene in an F2-27\u2013dependent manner and had a highly effective cytotoxic effect in a GCV-dependent manner. Additionally, F2-27 independently inhibited migration of EphA2-positive breast cancer cell lines in three-dimensional culture.

METHODS: From August 2013 to August 2014, we screened 11,332 (male 7144; female 4188) high-risk individuals in selected communities of Minhang, Shanghai City, for early diagnosis of lung cancer with LDCT combined with multidisciplinary comprehensive treatment pattern including minimally invasive surgery, exploring the medical service network covering prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, and follow-up. RESULTS: Screening resulted in a diagnosis of cancer in 29 participants. Of these participants, 27 had primary lung cancer, 1 had lung metastatic cancer, and 1 had breast cancer. The detection rate of primary lung cancer was 238.26 cases per 100,000 person-years among all the participants.

In a clonogenic survival assay, MK-8776 demonstrated a more pronounced radiosensitizing effect than UCN-01, with lower cytotoxicity. Importantly, radiosensitization by MK-8776 can be achieved at doses as low as 2.5 Gy, which is a clinically applicable irradiation dose. MK-8776, but not UCN-01, exacerbated mitotic catastrophe (MC) and centrosome abnormalities, without affecting repair kinetics of DNA double strand breaks. Furthermore, live-cell imaging revealed that MK-8776 significantly abrogated the radiation-induced G2/M checkpoint, prolonged the mitotic phase, and enhanced aberrant mitosis. This suggests that Chk1 inhibition by MK-8776 activates a spindle assembly checkpoint and increases mitotic defects in irradiated EMT6 cells. In conclusion, we have shown that, at minimally toxic concentrations, MK-8776 enhances radiation-induced cell death through the enhancement of aberrant mitosis and MC, without affecting DNA damage repair.",

Studies that reported data on comparisons of therapeutic efficacy of LRN and ORN were included. The fixed-effects model was used in this meta-analysis if there was no evidence of heterogeneity; otherwise, the random-effects model was used. RESULTS: Thirty-seven articles were included in the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that the overall mortality was significantly lower in the LRN group than that in the ORN group (odds ratio [OR] =0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62-0.95).

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrence or metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is mainly intrahepatic after curative resection, demonstrating that the peritumoral environment is important but often neglected. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in intratumoral liver tissues is a poor prognosis factor whose impact is removed after curative resection. However, PD-L1 expression remains in the peritumoral liver tissues and its distribution and prognostic value are still not clear. METHODS: We assessed the expression of PD-L1 by immunohistochemistry in peritumoral liver tissues from 90 HCC patients who underwent curative hepatectomy. The results were validated in an independent cohort of additional 90 HCC patients. RESULTS: We found PD-L1 positive expression in 31.11% (28/90) of peritumoral tissues. Peritumoral PD-L1 expression was associated with a significantly worse overall survival (OS) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.000) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) compared to the negative expression group. Additionally, peritumoral PD-L1 positivity significantly correlated with vascular invasion and a lower albumin level (\u226435 g/L). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models both revealed peritumoral PD-L1 as an independent prognostic factor for OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.853, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002) and DFS (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.362, P\u00a0=\u00a0.003). The prognostic value of PD-L1 positivity was validated in the independent data set. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest PD-L1 expression in peritumoral hepatocytes is an independent prognostic factor for OS and DFS. This implies that future anti-cancer therapy should target not only residual tumor cells but also the \u201csoil\u201d for promoting tumor growth. Peritumoral PD-L1 could be a good target for adjuvant therapy after hepatectomy.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A micro-molecule peptide TP1623 of 99mTc-human epithelial growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) was prepared and the feasibility of using it as a HER2-positive molecular imaging agent for breast cancer was evaluated. METHODS: TP1623 was chemically synthesized and labeled with 99mTc. The labeling ratio and stability were detected. HER2 expression levels of breast cancer cells (SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231) and cell binding activity were measured. Biodistribution of 99mTC-TP1623 in normal mice was detected. SKBR3/MDA-MB-231-bearing nude mice models with high/low expressions of HER2 were established. Tumor tissues were stained with hematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) and measured by immunohistochemistry to confirm the formation of tumors and HER2 expression. SPECT imaging was conducted for HER2-overexpressing SKBR3-bearing nude mice. The T/NT ratio was calculated and compared with that of MDA-MB-231-bearing nude mice with low HER2 expression. The competitive inhibition image was used to discuss the specific binding of 99mTc- TP1623 and the tumor. RESULTS: The labeling ratio of 99mTc-TP1623, specific activity, and radiochemical purity (RCP) after 6 h at room temperature were (97.39 \u00b1 0.23)%, (24.61 \u00b1 0.06) TBq/mmol, and (93.25 \u00b1 0.06)%, respectively. HER2 of SKBR3 and MDA-MB-231 cells showed high and low expression levels by immunohistochemistry, respectively. The in vitro receptor assays indicated that specific binding of TP1623 and HER2 was retained. Radioactivity in the brain was always at the lowest level, while the clearance rate of blood and the excretion rate of the kidneys were fast. HE staining showed that tumor cells were observed in SKBR3- and MDA-MB-231-bearing nude mice, with significant heteromorphism and increased mitotic count. The imaging of mice showed that targeted images could be made of 99mTc-TP1623 in high HER2-expressing tumors, while no obvious development was shown in tumors in low HER2-expressing nude mice. No development was visible in tumors in competitive inhibition of imaging, which indicates the combination of 99mTc-TP1623 and tumor was mediated by HER2. CONCLUSION: High labeling ratio and specific activity of 99mTc-TP1623 is successfully prepared; it is a molecular imaging agent for HER2-positive tumors that has potential applicative value.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We enrolled 639 NPC patients with stage II to IVB and undetectable pEBV DNA to receive CCRT with or without NACT. Radiotherapy was 2.0 to 2.27 Gy per fraction with five daily fractions per week for 6 to 7 weeks to the primary tumor and 62 to 70 Gy to the involved neck area. NACT was cisplatin (80-100 mg/m2\u00a0day 1) and 5-fluorouracil (800-1000 mg/m2, 120-hour continuous intravenous infusion) every 3 weeks for two or three cycles. CCRT was cisplatin (80-100 mg/m2\u00a0day 1) every 3 weeks for three cycles. RESULTS: For all patients, the 5-year overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and progression-free survival (PFS) rates were 91.9%, 92.2%, 95.0%, and 86.4%, respectively. There was no significant difference in OS (5-year OS 90.8% [NACT + CCRT group] vs 92.7% [CCRT alone]; hazard ratio [HR] 1.24; P\u00a0=\u00a0.486), LRFS (HR 1.13, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-2.14, P\u00a0=\u00a0.715), DMFS (HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.34-1.78, P\u00a0=\u00a0.554), or PFS (HR 1.21, 95% CI 0.75-1.95, P\u00a0=\u00a0.472). CONCLUSION: CCRT with or without NACT produced a good treatment outcome in patients with locoregionally advanced NPC and undetectable pEBV DNA, but NACT before CCRT did not significantly improve survival rates.",

Panitumumab, a fully human and less immunogenic mAb that binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (Erb1; HER1), was evaluated for targeted \u03b1-particle radiation therapy using 212Pb, an in vivo \u03b1 generator. A single dose of 212Pb-panitumumab administered to athymic mice bearing LS-174T intraperitoneal (i.p.) tumor xenografts was found to have greater therapeutic efficacy when directly compared with 212Pb-trastuzumab, which binds to HER2. A dose escalation study determined a maximum effective working dose of 212Pb-panitumumab to be 20\u00a0\u03bcCi with a median survival of 35 days versus 25 days for the untreated controls. Pretreatment of tumor-bearing mice with paclitaxel and gemcitabine 24\u00a0hours prior to injection of 212Pb-pantiumumab at 10 or 20\u00a0\u03bcCi resulted in the greatest enhanced therapeutic response at the higher dose with median survivals of 106 versus 192 days, respectively. The greatest therapeutic impact, however, was observed in the animals that were treated with topotecan 24\u00a0hours prior to RIT and then again 24\u00a0hours after RIT; the best response from this combination was also obtained with the lower 10-\u03bcCi dose of 212Pb-panitumumab (median survival >280 days). In summary, 212Pb-panitumumab is an excellent candidate for the treatment of HER1-positive disseminated i.p. disease. Furthermore, the potentiation of the therapeutic impact of 212Pb-pantiumumab by chemotherapeutics confirms and validates the importance of developing a multimodal therapy regimen.",

Although tumors are initially radio- and chemosensitive, the management of inoperable or metastatic MLS can be challenging. Therefore, our aim was to identify novel targets for systemic therapy. We performed an in vitro high-throughput drug screen using three MLS cell lines (402091, 1765092, DL-221), which were treated with 273 different drugs at four different concentrations. Cell lines and tissue microarrays were used for validation. As expected, all cell lines revealed a strong growth inhibition to conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines and taxanes. A good response was observed to compounds interfering with Src and the mTOR pathway, which are known to be affected in these tumors. Moreover, BIRC5 was important for MLS survival because a strong inhibitory effect was seen at low concentration using the survivin inhibitor YM155, and siRNA for BIRC5 decreased cell viability. Immunohistochemistry revealed abundant expression of survivin restricted to the nucleus in all 32 tested primary tumor specimens. Inhibition of survivin in 402-91 and 1765-92 by YM155 increased the percentage S-phase but did not induce apoptosis, which warrants further investigation before application in the treatment of metastatic MLS. Thus, using a 273-compound drug screen, we confirmed previously identified targets (mTOR, Src) in MLS and demonstrate survivin as essential for MLS survival.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant primary brain tumor, with an average survival rate of 15 months. GBM is highly refractory to therapy, and such unresponsiveness is due, primarily, but not exclusively, to the glioma stem-like cells (GSCs). This subpopulation express stem-like cell markers and is responsible for the heterogeneity of GBM, generating multiple differentiated cell phenotypes. However, how GBMs maintain the balance between stem and non-stem populations is still poorly understood. We investigated the GBM ability to interconvert between stem and non-stem states through the evaluation of the expression of specific stem cell markers as well as cell communication proteins. We evaluated the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of GSCs derived from differentiated GBM cell lines by comparing their stem-like cell properties and expression of connexins. We showed that non-GSCs as well as GSCs can undergo successive cycles of gain and loss of stem properties, demonstrating a bidirectional cellular plasticity model that is accompanied by changes on connexins expression. Our findings indicate that the interconversion between non-GSCs and GSCs can be modulated by extracellular factors culminating on differential expression of stem-like cell markers and cell-cell communication proteins. Ultimately, we observed that stem markers are mostly expressed on GBMs rather than on low-grade astrocytomas, suggesting that the presence of GSCs is a feature of high-grade gliomas. Together, our data demonstrate the utmost importance of the understanding of stem cell plasticity properties in a way to a step closer to new strategic approaches to potentially eliminate GSCs and, hopefully, prevent tumor recurrence.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of MRI texture and shape analysis in grading meningiomas. METHODS: A surgical database was reviewed to identify meningioma patients who had undergone tumor resection between January 2015 and December 2016. Preoperative MR images were retrieved and analyzed. Texture and shape analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate tumor heterogeneity and morphology. Three machine learning classifiers were trained with these features to build classification models. The performance of the features and classification models was assessed. RESULTS: A total of 131 patients were included in this study: 21 with high-grade meningiomas and 110 with low-grade meningiomas. Three texture features were selected: Horzl_RLNonUni, S(2,2)SumOfSqs, and WavEnHL_s-3; three shape features were selected: GeoFv, GeoW4, and GeoW5b. The Mann\u2013Whitney test indicated that all six features were significantly different between high-grade and low-grade meningiomas. AUC values were generally greater than 0.50 (range, 0.73 to 0.88). Sensitivities and specificities ranged from 47.62% to 90.48% and 69.09% to 96.36%, respectively. Among the nine classification models obtained, the one built by training the SVM classifier with all six features achieved the best performance, with a sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, and AUC of 0.86, 0.87, 0.87, and 0.87, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Texture and shape analysis, especially when combined with a SVM classifier, can provide satisfactory performance in the preoperative determination of meningioma grade and is thus potentially useful for clinical application.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIM: Desmoplasia is a characteristic feature and a suspected mechanism of tumor progression in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Main constituents of the stroma involve cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and extracellular matrix (ECM). The aim of this study was to dissect the interaction of CAFs, ECM, and PDAC cells in both an in vitro setting and a large-scale clinical cohort study. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Patients operated for PDAC were identified from our prospectively maintained clinical database. A standard pathology protocol was applied for pancreatoduodenectomy specimens also assessing CAF activation as either CAF grade 0 or CAF grade +. Interaction between a spectrum of pancreatic cancer cell lines (PCCs) and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (NIH 3T3) was assessed in a conditioned medium experimental setup. RESULTS: One hundred eleven patients operated for PDAC from 2001 to 2011 were identified. Univariate analysis disclosed CAF grade + (P = .030), positive M status (P < .001), and lymph node ratio (LNR) > 0.1 (P = .045) to impair overall survival. Independent prognostic factors were CAF grade (P = .050) and positive M status (P = .002). CAF grade correlated with N status (CC = 0.206, P = .030), LNR (CC = 0.187, P = .049), tumor size (CC = \u22120.275, P = .003), and M status (CC = 0.190, P = .045). In the in vitro setting, paracrine effects of pancreatic cancer cell resulted in morphological activation of fibroblasts and tumor cell differentiation\u2013dependent increase of fibroblast growth. Paracrine effects of poorly differentiated PCCs led to an upregulation of Vimentin in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Paracrine effects of fibroblasts on their part promoted cancer cell motility in all PCCs. As the second stromal component, fibroblast-derived ECM resulted in significantly decreased proliferation depending on density and led to upregulation of ZEB1 in poorly differentiated PCCs. CONCLUSION: In PDAC patients, positive CAF grading was identified as a negative prognostic parameter correlating with positive N status, high LNR, positive M status, and smaller tumor size. Whereas bilateral interaction of PCCs and CAFs promotes tumor progression, ECM poses PCC growth restrictions. In summary, our study discloses differential effects of stromal components and may help to interpret heterogeneous results of former studies.",

The purpose of the present study was to investigate possible associations between CBCT findings and histopathological features in breast cancer. METHODS: Overall, 59 female patients, mean age of 64.6 years with histological proven breast cancer were included into the study. In all cases, non-contrast CBCT examination was done. The diagnosis of the identified lesions was confirmed histologically by biopsy. Immunohistochemical staining against estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and Ki-67 was performed for every lesion. Collected data were evaluated by means of descriptive statistics. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to analyze the association between CT density and Ki-67 values. P values <0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance in all instances. RESULTS: The size of the lesion varied from 2.7 to 90.0, mean size, 15.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.0 mm. The mean value of CT density of the lesions was 63.95\u00a0\u00b1\u00a038.18 HU. The density tended to be higher in tubular carcinoma. Correlation analysis identified no significant correlations between CT density and Ki-67 level (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.031, P\u00a0=\u00a0.784). There were no statistically significant differences of CT density between tumors with different receptor status. CONCLUSIONS: No significant associations between CT density and receptor status in breast cancer. Tubular carcinoma tended to have higher CT density in comparison to other subtypes of breast carcinomas.",

We aimed to overcome crizotinib resistance by combining with the MEK inhibitor trametinib or low-dose metronomic (LDM) topotecan in preclinical neuroblastoma models. METHODS: We selected a panel of neuroblastoma cell lines carrying various ALK genetic aberrations to assess the therapeutic efficacy on cell proliferation in vitro. Downstream signals of ALK activation, including phosphorylation of ERK1/2, Akt as well as HIF-1\u03b1 expression were evaluated under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Tumor growth inhibition was further assessed in NOD/SCID xenograft mouse models. RESULTS: All NBL cell lines responded to crizotinib treatment but at variable ED50 levels, ranging from 0.25 to 5.58 \u03bcM. ALK-mutated cell lines SH-SY5Y, KELLY, LAN-5, and CHLA-20 are more sensitive than ALK wild-type cell lines. In addition, we demonstrated that under hypoxic conditions, all NBL cell lines showed marked decrease of ED50s when compared to normoxia except for KELLY cells. Taking into consideration the hypoxia sensitivity to crizotinib, combined treatment with crizotinib and LDM topotecan demonstrated a synergistic effect in ALKF1174L-mutated SH-SY5Y cells. In vivo, single-agent crizotinib showed limited antitumor activity in ALKF1174L-mutated SH-SY5Y and KELLY xenograft models; however, when combined with topotecan, significantly delayed tumor development was achieved in both SH-SY5Y and KELLY tumor models.

The pathobiology of oral mucositis remains incompletely understood due to lack of appropriate models which recapitulate the human condition. Existing rodent models are intraperitoneal and require radiation, chemical or mechanical injury to the chemotherapy protocol to induce oral lesions. We aimed to develop an OM mouse model that is induced solely by chemotherapy and reproduces macroscopic, histopathologic and inflammatory characteristics of the human condition. Female C57BL/6 mice were given intravenous 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) injections every 48 hours, for 2 weeks. A high daily dose of intraperitoneal administration was tested for comparison. Mice were monitored daily for weight loss. Epithelial histomorphometric analyses in tongue, esophageal and intestinal tissues were conducted coupled with assessment of apoptosis, cell proliferation, neutrophilic infiltration and the integrity of adherens junctions by immunohistochemistry. Neutropenia was assessed in peripheral blood and bone marrow. Tissues were analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokines at the protein and mRNA levels. Daily intraperitoneal administration of 5-FU led to rapid weight loss and intestinal mucositis, but no oral inflammatory changes. Intravenous administration triggered atrophy of the oral and esophageal epithelium accompanied by reduction in cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Coincidental with these changes were up-regulation of NF-\u03baB, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, GM-CSF, IL-6 and KC. Despite neutropenia, increased oral neutrophilic infiltration and reduced E-cadherin was observed in oroesophageal mucosae.

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: SIRT1 is a longevity gene that forestalls aging and age-related diseases including cancer, and has recently attracted widespread attention due to its overexpression in some cancers. We previously identified the overexpression of SIRT1 in ovarian carcinoma (OvCa) as a poor prognostic factor. However, mechanistic insights into the function of SIRT1 in OvCa have yet to be elucidated. METHODS: Quantitative real-time reverse PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to examine the expression of SIRT1 in a panel of human OvCa cell lines. si-RNA or sh-RNA and cDNA technologies were utilized to knockdown or overexpress SIRT1, respectively. The effects of SIRT1 on proliferation and chemoresistance were examined using a WST-1 assay, and the underlying mechanisms were confirmed using an apoptotic assay, and the quantification of glutathione (GSH), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The aggressiveness of SIRT1 was analyzed using in vitro invasion and migration assays. RESULTS: SIRT1 was more strongly expressed in OvCa cell lines than in the immortalized ovarian epithelium at the gene and protein levels. Stress up-regulated the expression of SIRT1 in dose- and time-dependent manners. SIRT1 significantly enhanced the proliferation (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), chemoresistance (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), and aggressiveness of OvCa cells by up-regulating multiple antioxidant pathways to inhibit oxidative stress. Further study into the overexpression of SIRT1 demonstrated the up-regulation of several stemness-associated genes and enrichment of CD44v9 via an as-yet-unidentified pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that SIRT1 plays a role in the acquisition of aggressiveness and chemoresistance by OvCa, and has potential as a therapeutic target for OvCa.",

We observed down-regulation of 23 out of 29 subunits of the ATP synthase. Differential expression was validated exemplarily for 12 genes (ATP5A1, ATP5B, ATPAF1, ATP5C1, ATP5D, ATP5O, ATP5F1, ATP5G1, ATP5G2, ATP5G3, ATP5I, ATP5S; screening cohort ccRCC n\u00a0=\u00a018 and normal renal tissue n\u00a0=\u00a010) using real-time PCR.

We observed that altered expression of ATPAF1 and ATP5G1/G2/G3 was correlated with overall survival in patients with ccRCC. In conclusion, down-regulation of many ATP Synthase subunits occurs in ccRCC and is the basis for the reduced activity of the mitochondrial electron chain. Alteration of the expression of ATP5A1, ATPAF1, and ATP5G1/G2/G3 is characteristic for ccRCC and may be prognostic for ccRCC patients' outcome.",

Our objective was to determine the antitumor effect of GSK-3 inhibitor 9-ING-41 in combination with chemotherapy in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of human GBM. We utilized chemoresistant PDX models of GBM, GBM6 and GBM12, to study the effect of 9-ING-41 used alone and in combination with chemotherapy on tumor progression and survival. GBM6 and GBM12 were transfected by reporter constructs to enable bioluminescence imaging, which was used to stage animals prior to treatment and to follow intracranial GBM tumor growth. Immunohistochemical staining, apoptosis assay, and immunoblotting were used to assess the expression of GSK-3\u03b2 and the effects of treatment in these models.

Higher pretreatment CECT tumor density was associated with longer PFS and OS [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a00.968, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002, and HR\u00a0=\u00a00.956, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001, respectively], and CECT density was inversely correlated with tumor growth (P\u00a0=\u00a0.010). Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified two CECT density cut-off values (63.67 HU, sensitivity 0.704, specificity 0.694; and 68.67 HU, sensitivity 0.593, specificity 0.806) which yielded subpopulations with significantly different PFS and OS (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Pretreatment CECT is therefore a promising noninvasive strategy for response prediction in sunitinib-treated mRCC patients, identifying patients who will derive maximum therapeutic benefit.",

Mice were irradiated 30 hours after the second injection in a thermal neutron beam for various lengths of time. The tumor size was monitored daily for 72 days. Despite relatively lower tumor boron concentrations, as compared to EMT6 tumors, a 45 minute neutron irradiation BNCT resulted in complete resolution of the tumors in 50% of treated mice, 50% of which never recurred. Median time to tumor volume tripling was 38 days in BNCT treated mice, 17 days in neutron-irradiated mice given no boron compounds, and 4 days in untreated controls. Tumor response in mice with CT26 colon carcinoma was markedly more pronounced than in previous reports of mice with EMT6 tumors, a difference which increased with dose. The slope of the dose response curve of CT26 colon carcinoma tumors is 1.05 times tumor growth delay per Gy compared to 0.09 times tumor growth delay per Gy for EMT6 tumors, indicating that inherent radiosensitivity of tumors plays a role in boron neutron capture therapy and should be considered in the development of clinical applications of BNCT in animals and man.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The presence of KRAS mutations in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) predicts poor response to agents targeting the EGFR. Even in patients with RAS wild type (WT) tumors, resistance eventually develops due to multiple mechanisms, including the expansion of previously undetected KRAS mutated clones. In this feasibility study, we aimed to detect KRAS exon 2 mutations in serial samples of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of RAS WT patients with mCRC captured by the Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumor cells (ISET) system. METHODS: CTC isolation using the ISET system was performed from prospectively collected blood samples obtained from patients with RAS and BRAF WT mCRC prior to first-line therapy initiation, at first imaging assessment and on disease progression. CTCs were enumerated using hematoxylin & eosin and CD45 double stain on a single membrane spot. DNA was extracted from 5 spots and KRAS exon 2 mutations were detected using a custom quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) assay. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and 28 blood samples were analyzed. In 9 (60%) patients, at least one sample was positive for the presence of a KRAS exon 2 mutation. In 11 out of 28 samples (39.2%) with detectable CTCs a KRAS mutation was detected; the corresponding percentages for baseline and on progression samples were 27% and 37.5%, respectively. The most commonly detected mutations were G13D and G12C (n\u00a0=\u00a03). The presence of KRAS mutated CTCs at baseline was not prognostic for either PFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.950) or OS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.383). CTC kinetics did not follow tumor response patterns. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrate that using a qPCR-based assay, KRAS exon 2 mutations could be detected in CTCs captured by the ISET system from patients with RAS WT primary tumors. However, the clinical relevance of these CTCs remains to be determined in future studies.",

Although more than half of Indian women present with advanced disease, many such patients do well. We have attempted identification of biologically indolent tumors within HR+HER2- tumors based on gene expression using histological grade as a guide to tumor aggression. 144 HR+HER2- tumors were divided into subclasses based on scores derived by using transcript levels of multiple genes representing survival, proliferation, and apoptotic pathways and compared to classification by Ki-67 labeling index (LI). Clinical characters and disease free survival were compared between the subclasses. The findings were independently validated in the METABRIC data set. Using the previously established estrogen receptor (ER) down stream activity equation, 20% of the tumors with greater than 10% HR positivity by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were still found to have inadequate ER function. A tumor aggression probability score was used to segregate the remainder of tumors into indolent (22%) and aggressive (58%) classes. Significant difference in disease specific survival was seen between the groups (P = .02). Aggression probability based subclassification had a higher hazard ratio and also independent prognostic value (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Independent validation of the gene panel in the METABRIC data set showed all 3 classes; indolent (24%), aggressive (68%), and insufficient ER signaling (7%) with differential survival (P = .01). In agreement with other recent reports, biologically indolent tumors can be identified with small sets of gene panels and these tumors exist in a population with predominantly late stage disease.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Prevention of bone metastases is a major issue for breast cancer patients, as it would improve quality of life in a population where long survival is anticipated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Early breast cancer patients, who had been treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy within two randomized trials, were included in the study. We evaluated, by quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction, 819 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples for mRNA expression of RANK, OPG, and RANKL, as well as their ratios, for potential prognostic significance for the development of bone metastases and also for disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival. RESULTS: Median age was 52.7\u00a0years, whereas 54.2% of the patients were postmenopausal and 78.3% estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor positive. After a median follow-up of 119.9\u00a0months, 226 patients (27.6%) had died and 291 patients (35.5%) had disease progression. Low mRNA expression of RANKL was associated with postmenopausal status and greater number of positive lymph nodes (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002 and P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, respectively). In the univariate analysis, low RANKL mRNA expression was found to be an unfavorable factor for DFS [hazard ratio (HR)\u00a0=\u00a01.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.68, Wald's P\u00a0=\u00a0.018] and bone metastasis\u2013free survival (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.67, 95% CI 1.09-2.56, P\u00a0=\u00a0.018), although it did not retain its significance in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Low RANKL mRNA expression in early breast cancer patients is of prognostic significance for increased risk for relapse and bone metastases and might potentially guide clinical decision-making for the use of anti-RANKL agents in the treatment of early breast cancer patients at high risk for metastatic spread, provided that our findings are validated in independent cohorts.",

To evaluate the prognostic value of metabolic parameters derived from serial 18F fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) in patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). METHODS. Thirteen patients with advanced EOC who received surgical staging and adjuvant platinum-based combination chemotherapy were prospectively enrolled. 18F\u2013FDG PET/CT was performed before and after the surgical staging, and after third cycle of chemotherapy. Tumor glucose metabolism at baseline and its change after operation and third cycle of chemotherapy such as changes of maximum standardized uptake values (\u0394SUVmax) via 18F\u2013FDG PET/CT were measured, and assessed regarding their ability to predict recurrence. RESULTS. Median duration of progression-free survival (PFS) was 25 months (range, 13\u201334), and although optimal debulking was performed in 10 patients, 5 (38.5%) patients experienced recurrence. Univariate analyses showed significant associations between recurrence and low \u0394SUVmax after surgical staging, and low SUVmax change after third cycle of chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis identified low \u0394SUVmax after third cycle of chemotherapy as an independent risk factor for recurrence (P\u00a0=\u00a0.047, hazard ratio (HR) 16.375, 95% CI 1.041\u2013257.536). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves showed that PFS significantly differed in groups categorized based on \u0394SUVmax after chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS. 18F\u2013FDG PET/CT allows for prediction of treatment response by the level of FDG uptake in terms of SUV at baseline and after chemotherapy. The metabolic response measured as \u0394SUVmax after third cycle of chemotherapy appears to be promising predictor of recurrence in patients with advanced EOC.",

METHODS AND MATERIALS: To develop a preclinical model that predicts clinical activity of novel agents in 19 RCC patients, we established patient-derived cell (PDC) and xenograft (PDX) models derived from malignant effusions or surgical specimen. RESULTS: Successful PDCs, defined as cells that maintained growth following two passages, were established in 5 of 15 malignant effusions and 1 of 4 surgical specimens. One PDC, clinically refractory to TKIs, was implanted and engrafted in mice, resulting in a comparable histology to the primary tumor. The PDC-PDX model also showed similar genomic features when tested using targeted sequencing of cancer-related genes. When we examined the drug effects of the PDX model, the tumor cells showed resistance to TKIs and everolimus in vitro. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the PDC-PDX preclinical model we developed using malignant effusions can be a useful preclinical model to interrogate sensitivity to targeted agents based on genomic alterations.",

Early diagnosis of lung cancer can significantly improve the survival rate of patients. This study aimed to investigate the micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) manifestations of early lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) in mice and to provide a new perspective for early clinical diagnosis. Early LAC models in 10 mice were established by subcutaneously injecting 1-methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) solution. Micro-CT scan and multiple planar reconstruction (MPR) were used for mouse lungs. Micro-CT features of early LAC, especially the relationships between tumor and bronchus, were analyzed and correlated with pathology. Micro-CT findings of early LAC were divided into three types: non-solid (n = 8, 6%), partly solid (n = 85, 64%) and totally solid (n = 39, 30%). Tumor-bronchus relationships, which could be observed in 110 of 132(83%) LAC, were classified into four patterns: type I (n = 16, 15%), bronchus was truncated at the margin of the tumor; type II (n = 33, 30%), bronchus penetrated into the tumor with tapered narrowing and interruption; type III (n = 38, 35%), bronchus penetrated into the tumor with a patent and intact lumen; type IV (n = 99, 90%), bronchus ran at the border of the tumor with an intact or compressed lumen. Micro-CT manifestations of early LAC correlated well with pathological findings. Micro-CT can clearly demonstrate the features of mouse early LAC and bronchus-tumor relationships, and can also provide a new tool and perspective for the study of early LAC.",

NFATc1 was positive in 51 [52%; 40 (40%) weak (1+), 9 (9%) moderate (2+), and 2 (2%) strong (3+)] of 99 UUTUCs, which was significantly higher than in benign urothelium [30 (36%) of 83; 28 (34%) weak and 2 (2%) moderate] (0 vs 1+/2+/3+, P\u00a0=\u00a0.038; 0/1+ vs 2+/3+, P\u00a0=\u00a0.023). There were no significant associations between NFATc1 expression pattern and tumor grade or pT stage. However, the positive rates of NFATc1 expression tended to be higher in renal pelvic tumors (60%) than in ureteral tumors (42%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.080) as well as in pN+ tumors (75%) than in pN0 tumors (49%; P\u00a0=\u00a0.089).

Thus, compared with nonneoplastic urothelium, a significant increase in the expression of NFATc1 in UUTUC was seen, implying the involvement of NFATc1 signals in the development of UUTUC.

Materials and Methods: Fifty patients with endoscopically proven esophageal cancer and indeterminate T1/T2/T3 stage by CT scan were examined on a 3-T scanner. The MRI protocol included C-VIBE at 150 seconds post\u2013IV contrast, immediately followed by a work-in-progress r-VIBE with identical spatial resolution (1.1 mm \u00d7 1.1 mm \u00d7 3.0 mm). Two independent readers assigned a T stage on MRI according to the 7th edition of UICC-AJCC TNM Classification, and postoperative pathologic confirmation was considered the gold standard. Interreader agreement was also calculated. Results: The T staging agreement between both VIBE techniques and postoperative pathologic T staging was 52% (26/50) for C-VIBE, 80% (40/50) for r-VIBE for reader 1, and 50% (25/50), 82% (41/50) for reader 2, respectively. For the esophageal cancer with invading lamina propria, muscularis mucosae, or submucosa (T1 stage), r-VIBE achieved 86% (12/14) agreement for both readers 1 and 2. For invasion of muscularis propria (T2 stage), r-VIBE achieved 83% (25/30) for both readers 1 and 2, whereas for the invasion of adventitia (T3 stage), r-VIBE could only achieve agreement in 50% (3/6) and 67% (4/6) for readers 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion: Contrast-enhanced free-breathing r-VIBE is superior to breath-hold CVIBE in T staging of potentially resectable esophageal cancer, especially for T1 and T2.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Irinotecan (IRI) is an integral part of colorectal cancer (CRC) therapy, but response rates are unsatisfactory and resistance mechanisms are still insufficiently understood. As fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) mediates essential survival signals in CRC, it is a candidate gene for causing intrinsic resistance to IRI. METHODS: We have used cell line models overexpressing FGFR3 to study the receptor's impact on IRI response. For pathway blockade, a dominant-negative receptor mutant and a small molecule kinase inhibitor were employed. RESULTS: IRI exposure induced expression of FGFR3 as well as its ligands FGF8 and FGF18 both in cell cultures and in xenograft tumors. As overexpression of FGFR3 mitigated IRI-induced apoptosis in CRC cell models, this suggests that the drug itself activated a survival response. On the cellular level, the antiapoptotic protein bcl-xl was upregulated and caspase 3 activation was inhibited. Targeting FGFR3 signaling using a dominant-negative receptor mutant sensitized cells for IRI. In addition, the FGFR inhibitor PD173074 acted synergistically with the chemotherapeutic drug and significantly enhanced IRI-induced caspase 3 activity in vitro. In vivo, PD173074 strongly inhibited growth of IRI-treated tumors. CONCLUSION: Together, our results indicate that targeting FGFR3 can be a promising strategy to enhance IRI response in CRC patients.",

Given that the androgen receptor (AR) has been discussed as a possible factor in the development and progression of bladder cancer, we investigated the predictive value of AR in stage pT1 NMIBC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data and AR mRNA expression in 296 patients with stage pT1 NMIBC who underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder. The mRNA expression of the AR transcript variants 1 (AR1) and 2 (AR2) was measured by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. AR expression was also correlated to KRT5 and KRT20 mRNA expression. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that high AR1 mRNA expression \u226535.47 is associated with statistically significant better recurrence-free survival (RFS) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0007), progression-free survival (PFS) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0420), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0050). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high AR1 mRNA expression is an independent prognostic marker for RFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0029) and CSS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0119). Spearman rank correlation revealed a significant positive association between mRNA expression of AR1 and KRT5 (rs: 0.3171, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) as well as a negative association with multifocal tumors (rs: 0.1478, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0109). No association was noted between AR1 expression and tumor grade, concomitant CIS, gender, tumor size, and KRT20 in patients with stage T1 NMIBC. CONCLUSIONS: AR mRNA expression can predict RFS and CSS in patients with stage T1 NMIBC. Further studies are necessary to refine the relevance of AR mRNA expression compared with immunohistochemically detectable AR expression.",

There is an increasing importance of the role of stroma in ovarian cancer metastasis; however, neither ROR1 nor ROR2 expression in tumor or stromal cells has been analyzed in the same clinical cohort. AIM: To determine ROR1 and ROR2 expression in ovarian cancer and surrounding microenvironment and examine associations with clinicopathological characteristics. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for ROR1 and ROR2 was used to assess receptor expression in a cohort of epithelial ovarian cancer patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0178). Results were analyzed in relation to clinical and histopathological characteristics and survival. Matched patient sample case studies of normal, primary, and metastatic lesions were used to examine ROR expression in relation to ovarian cancer progression. RESULTS: ROR1 and ROR2 are abnormally expressed in malignant ovarian epithelium and stroma. Higher ROR2 tumor expression was found in early-stage, low-grade endometrioid carcinomas. ROR2 stromal expression was highest in the serous subtype. In matched patient case studies, metastatic samples had higher expression of ROR2 in the stroma, and a recurrent sample had the highest expression of ROR2 in both tumor and stroma. CONCLUSION: ROR1 and ROR2 are expressed in tumor-associated stroma in all histological subtypes of ovarian cancer and hold potential as therapeutic targets which may disrupt tumor and stroma interactions.",

Aggressive and metastatic tumors are treated with androgen deprivation therapies (ADT); however, the tumors acquire resistance and develop into lethal castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). With the advent of better therapeutics, the incidences of a more aggressive neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) variant continue to emerge. Although de novo occurrences of NEPC are rare, more than 25% of the therapy-resistant patients on highly potent new-generation anti-androgen therapies end up with NEPC. This, along with previous observations of an increase in the number of such NE cells in aggressive tumors, has been suggested as a mechanism of resistance development during prostate cancer progression. Dovitinib (TKI-258/CHIR-258) is a pan receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor that targets VEGFR, FGFR, PDGFR, and KIT. It has shown efficacy in mouse-model of PCa bone metastasis, and is presently in clinical trials for several cancers. We observed that both androgen receptor (AR) positive and AR-negative PCa cells differentiate into a NE phenotype upon treatment with Dovitinib. The NE differentiation was also observed when mice harboring PC3-xenografted tumors were systemically treated with Dovitinib. The mechanistic underpinnings of this differentiation are unclear, but seem to be supported through MAPK-, PI3K-, and Wnt-signaling pathways. Further elucidation of the differentiation process will enable the identification of alternative salvage or combination therapies to overcome the potential resistance development.",

However, the clinical significance of Aurora A in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains undetermined. METHODS: The expression of Aurora A in NSCLC and paired normal adjacent lung tissues was determined by immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to determine a cutoff score for Aurora A expression in a training set (n\u00a0=\u00a0135). For validation, the ROC-derived cutoff score was subjected to analysis of the association of Aurora A expression with patient outcome and clinicopathological characteristics in a testing set (n\u00a0=\u00a0128) and overall patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0263). The correlation of Aurora A with cisplatin resistance and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was examined in vitro in NSCLC cells by overexpression or knockdown of Aurora A. RESULTS: Aurora A expression was significantly upregulated in tumor tissues compared with paired normal tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). The expression of Aurora A was closely associated with clinical stage, lymph node metastasis, and recurrence and was an independent prognostic parameter in multivariate analysis. High level of Aurora A expression predicted poorer overall survival and disease-free survival in NSCLC patients treated with cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro data showed that overexpression or knockdown of Aurora A resulted in increased or decreased cellular resistance to cisplatin. Furthermore, inhibition of Aurora A reversed the EMT process.

METHODS: Serum samples were collected from International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage IIB to IIIB cervical squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with platinum based Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in our hospital during September 2013 to November 2015. Twenty well-matched samples (10 resistant and 10 sensitive) were chosen to screen the miRNA expression profile using serum samples pooled with microarrays. miRNAs expressed significantly different between two groups were further verified in 131 patients (29 resistant and 102 sensitive) serum samples with TaqMan Real-time PCR. The AUC was used to evaluate the accuracy of the biomarkers for prediction. RESULTS: MiR-136-5, miR-152-3p and miR-206 were expressed significantly different between sensitive and resistant groups. Results of 131 patients verification showed that the levels of miR-206 in sensitive samples and resistant samples were 2.715\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.2115 and 14.64\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.184, respectively, which was significantly different (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), while miR-136-5p and miR-152-3p could not be tested without pre-amplification reactions. Univariate analysis revealed that miR-206 expression was significantly associated with patients' DFS. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that miR-206 expression, tumor differentiation and pelvic lymph nodes metastasis were the independent prognostic factors associated with DFS in this cohort (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008, 0.000, 0.000, respectively). The probability of the prognostic accuracy of miR-206 expression in predicting chemoradiotherapy sensitivity of ACSCC patients was 91.3% (79.3% sensitivity and 92.2% specificity). CONCLUSION: Serum miR-206 is a powerful tool in predicting chemoradiotherapy sensitivity in ACSCC patients.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Blood-based proteomic profiling may aid and expand our understanding of diseases and their different phenotypes. The aim of the presented study was to profile serum samples from patients with malignant melanoma using affinity proteomic assays to describe proteins in the blood stream that are associated to stage or recurrence of melanoma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Multiplexed protein analysis was conducted using antibody suspension bead arrays. A total of 232 antibodies against 132 proteins were selected from (i) a screening with 4595 antibodies and 32 serum samples from melanoma patients and controls, (ii) antibodies used for immunohistochemistry, (iii) protein targets previously related with melanoma. The analysis was performed with 149 serum samples from patients with malignant melanoma. Antibody selectivity was then assessed by Western blot, immunocapture mass spectrometry, and epitope mapping. Lastly, indicative antibodies were applied for IHC analysis of melanoma tissues. RESULTS: Serum levels of regucalcin (RGN) and syntaxin 7 (STX7) were found to be lower in patients with both recurring tumors and a high Breslow's thickness (T-stage 3/4) compared to low thickness (T-stage 1/2) without disease recurrence. Serum levels of methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1-like (MTHFD1L) were instead elevated in sera of T3/4 patients with recurrence. The analysis of tissue sections with S100A6 and MTHFD1L showed positive staining in a majority of patients with melanoma, and S100A6 was significantly associated to T-stage. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a starting point to further study RGN, STX7, MTHFD1L and S100A6 in serum to elucidate their involvement in melanoma progression and to assess a possible contribution to support clinical indications.",

     "abstract": "We present an integrative genome-wide analysis that can be used to predict the risk of progression from leukoplakia to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) arising in the gingivobuccal complex (GBC). We find that the genomic and transcriptomic profiles of leukoplakia resemble those observed in later stages of OSCC and that several changes are associated with this progression, including amplification of 8q24.3, deletion of 8p23.2, and dysregulation of DERL3, EIF5A2, ECT2, HOXC9, HOXC13, MAL, MFAP5 and NELL2. Comparing copy number profiles of primary tumors with and without lymph-node metastasis, we identify alterations associated with metastasis, including amplifications of 3p26.3, 8q24.21, 11q22.1, 11q22.3 and deletion of 8p23.2. Integrative analysis reveals several biomarkers that have never or rarely been reported in previous OSCC studies, including amplifications of 1p36.33 (attributable to MXRA8), 3q26.31 (EIF5A2), 9p24.1 (CD274), and 12q13.2 (HOXC9 and HOXC13). Additionally, we find that amplifications of 1p36.33 and 11q22.1 are strongly correlated with poor clinical outcome. Overall, our findings delineate genomic changes that can be used in treatment management for patients with potentially malignant leukoplakia and OSCC patients with higher risk of lymph-node metastasis.",

     "abstract": "miR-142-3p was reported to be downregulated in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and acted as a novel diagnostic marker. However, the regulatory effect of miR-142-3p on drug resistance of AML cells and its underlying mechanism have not been elucidated. Here, we found that miR-142-3p was significantly downregulated and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) was dramatically upregulated in AML samples and cells, as well as drug-resistant AML cells. P-gp level and autophagy were markedly enhanced in HL-60/ADR and HL-60/ATRA cells. miR-142-3p overexpression improved drug sensitivity of AML cells by inhibiting cell viability and promoting apoptosis, and inhibited P-gp level and autophagy in drug-resistant AML cells, whereas HMGB1 overexpression obviously reversed these effect. HMGB1 was demonstrated to be a target of miR-142-3p, and miR-142-3p negatively regulated HMGB1 expression. In conclusion, our study elucidated that upregulation of miR-142-3p improves drug sensitivity of AML through reducing P-glycoprotein and repressing autophagy by targeting HMGB1, contributing to better understanding the molecular mechanism of drug resistance in AML.",

Here, we investigated F8-TNF in a syngeneic K7 M2\u2013derived orthotopic model of osteosarcoma as a treatment against pulmonary metastases, the most frequent cause of osteosarcoma-related death. Immunofluorescence on human osteosarcoma tissue confirmed the presence of EDA in primary tumors (PTs) as well as metastases. In mice, the efficacy of F8-TNF against PTs and early pulmonary metastases was evaluated. Intratibial PT growth was not affected by F8-TNF, yet early micrometastases were reduced possibly due to an F8-TNF\u2013dependent attraction of pulmonary CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer cells. Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed stronger expression of EDA in early pulmonary metastases compared with PT tissue. To study progressing pulmonary metastases, a hind limb amputation model was established, and the efficacy of F8-TNF, alone or combined with doxorubicin, was investigated. Despite the presence of EDA in metastases, no inhibition of progressive metastatic growth was detected. No significant differences in numbers of CD4+ or CD8+ cells or F4/80+ and Ly6G+ myeloid-derived cells were observed, although a strong association between metastatic growth and presence of pulmonary Ly6G+ myeloid-derived cells was detected. In summary, these findings demonstrate the potential of F8-TNF in activating the immune system and reducing early metastatic growth yet suggest a lack of efficacy of F8-TNF alone or combined with doxorubicin against progressing osteosarcoma metastases.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Gastric cancer studies indicated a potential correlation between circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood and tumor relapse/metastasis. The prevalence and significance of circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) in gastric cancer remain unknown. We investigated the prevalence and prognostic value of CTCs and CTM for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in gastric cancer patients. METHODS:Eighty-one gastric cancer patients consented to provide 5\u00a0ml of peripheral blood before systematic therapy. CTCs and CTM were isolated using isolation by size of epithelial tumor cells and characterized by cytopathologists. For 41 stage IV gastric cancer patients, CTM was investigated as a potential biomarker to predict prognosis. RESULTS:CTCs were detected in 51 patients; the average count was 1.81. In clinical stage I, II, III, and IV patients, the average CTC counts were 1.40, 0.67, 1.24, and 2.71, respectively. CTM were detected in 3 of 33 clinical stage I to IIIb patients, at an average of 0.12 (0-2). CTM were detected in 13 of 53 clinical stage IIIc to IV patients, at an average of 1.26 (0-22). In stage IV patients, CTM positivity correlated with the CA125 level. PFS and OS in CTM-positive patients were significantly lower than in CTM-negative patients (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). CTM positivity was an independent factor for determining the PFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.016) and OS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003) of stage IV patients in multivariate analysis. Using markers of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, single CTCs were divided into three phenotypes including epithelial CTCs, biphenotypic epithelial/mesenchymal CTCs, and mesenchymal CTCs. For CTM, CK\u2212/Vimentin+/CD45\u2212 and CK+/Vimentin+/CD45\u2212 phenotypes were observed, but the CK+/Vimentin\u2212/CD45\u2212 CTM phenotype was not. CA125 was detected in gastric cancer cell lines BGC823 and MGC803. CONCLUSIONS: In stage IV patients, CTM positivity was correlated with serum CA125 level. CTM were an independent predictor of shorter PFS and OS in stage IV patients. Thus, CTM detection may be a useful tool to predict prognosis in stage IV patients.",

In this study, multiple lung adenocarcinomas occurring in the same patient were evaluated using comprehensive histopathologic evaluation supplemented with molecular analysis. The cohort included 18 patients with a total of 52 lung adenocarcinomas. Eleven patients had a new diagnosis of multiple adenocarcinomas in the same lobe (n\u00a0=\u00a05) or different lobe (n\u00a0=\u00a06). Seven patients had a history of lung cancer and developed multiple new tumors. The final diagnosis was made in resection specimens (n\u00a0=\u00a049), fine needle aspiration (n\u00a0=\u00a02), and biopsy (n\u00a0=\u00a01). Adenocarcinomas were non\u2010mucinous, and histopathologic comparison of tumors was performed. All tumors save for one were subjected to ALK gene rearrangement testing and targeted Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). Using clinical, radiologic, and morphologic features, a confident conclusion favoring synchronous/metachronous or metastatic disease was made in 65% of patients. Cases that proved challenging included ones with more than three tumors showing overlapping growth patterns and lacking a predominant lepidic component. Genomic signatures unique to each tumor were helpful in determining the relationship of multiple carcinomas in 72% of patients. Collectively, morphologic and genomic data proved to be of greater value and achieved a conclusive diagnosis in 94% of patients. Assessment of the genomic profiles of multiple lung adenocarcinomas complements the histological findings, enabling a more comprehensive assessment of synchronous, metachronous, and metastatic lesions in most patients, thereby improving staging accuracy. Targeted NGS can identify genetic alterations with therapeutic implications.",

Here we set out to analyze whether global gene expression profiling performed in a group of early-stage NSCLC patients can contribute to classifying tumor subtypes and predicting the disease prognosis. Gene expression profiling was performed with the use of the microarray technology in a training set of 108 NSCLC samples. Subsequently, the recorded findings were validated further in an independent cohort of 44 samples. We demonstrated that the specific gene patterns differed significantly between lung adenocarcinoma (AC) and squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) samples. Furthermore, we developed and validated a novel 53-gene signature distinguishing SCC from AC with 93% accuracy. Evaluation of the classifier performance in the validation set showed that our predictor classified the AC patients with 100% sensitivity and 88% specificity. We revealed that gene expression patterns observed in the early stages of NSCLC may help elucidate the histological distinctions of tumors through identification of different gene-mediated biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of histologically distinct tumors. However, we showed here that the gene expression profiles did not provide additional value in predicting the progression status of the early-stage NSCLC. Nevertheless, the gene expression signature analysis enabled us to perform a reliable subclassification of NSCLC tumors, and it can therefore become a useful diagnostic tool for a more accurate selection of patients for targeted therapies.",

In this study, we aimed to reveal the reliable frequency and the clinical-pathologic characteristics of pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma (PSC) with ALK rearrangement in Chinese population, and to provide insight into the translatability of anti-ALK treatment in this treatment-refractory disease. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using a Ventana anti-ALK (D5F3) rabbit monoclonal antibody was performed in 141 PSC specimens collected from multiple medical centers. IHC-positive cases were then confirmed using ALK fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The incidence rates and clinical-pathologic characteristics of ALK-rearranged PSC were then analyzed. Response to ALK inhibitor crizotinib in a patient with ALK-rearranged PSC was evaluated according to the response evaluation criteria for solid tumors (RECIST) version 1.1. RESULTS: Five of 141 (3.5%) of PSCs showed ALK rearrangement-positive by IHC and then were confirmed by FISH. Two were carcinosarcomas and the other three were pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma (PPC). Strong positive ALK rearrangement was observed in both the epithelioid and sarcomatoid components. The median age of ALK-positive patients was younger than that of ALK-negative patients. PSCs in never-smokers were more likely to harbor ALK rearrangement than those in former or current smokers (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). A 40-year-old woman diagnosed with ALK-rearranged PPC experienced a partial response (\u221232%) to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of ALK rearrangement in PSC in the Chinese population are similar to those of other subtypes of NSCLC. PSCs in younger never-smokers are more often to harbor ALK rearrangement. ALK inhibitors may serve as an effective treatment for ALK-rearranged PSC.",

METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the expression of E-cadherin, CD44, and MSH2 in 223 paraffin-embedded stage II and III CRC specimens using immunohistochemistry in the training cohort. Their prognostic values were assessed using Kaplan\u2013Meier curves and univariate and multivariate COX regression models. Moreover, a number of risk factors were used to form nomograms to evaluate survival, and Harrell's concordance index (C-index) was used to evaluate the predictive accuracy. Further validation of the nomograms was performed in an independent cohort of 115 cases. RESULTS: Low E-cadherin expression and low CD44 expression were significantly associated with diminished overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in stage II and III CRC patients and patients with negative MSH2 expression had better clinical outcomes. Moreover, the multivariate COX analysis identified E-cadherin, CD44 and MSH2 expression as independent prognostic factors for DFS and OS. Using these three markers and three clinicopathological risk variables, two nomograms were constructed and externally validated for predicting OS and DFS (C-index: training cohort, 0.779 (95% CI 0.722\u20130.835) and 0.771 (0.720\u20130.822), respectively; validation cohort, 0.773 (0.709\u20130.837) and 0.670 (0.594\u20130.747), respectively). CONCLUSION: The expression levels of E-cadherin, CD44 and MSH2 were independent prognostic factors for stage II and III CRC patients.

We then tested the antitumor effect of modified DCs both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that in vitro modified DCs could dramatically enhance T-cell proliferation (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and killing of LLCs than control groups (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Moreover, modified DCs could reduce tumor size and prolong the survival of LLC tumor-bearing mice than control groups (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01 and P\u00a0<\u00a0.01, respectively). Mechanistically, modified DCs demonstrated enhanced homing to T-cell\u2013rich compartments and triggered more naive T cells to become cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which exhibited significant infiltration into the tumors. Interestingly, modified DCs also markedly reduced tumor cells harboring stem cell markers in mice (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), suggesting the potential role on cancer stem-like cells.

In this study, a new RCC antigen, PTPL1 associated RhoGAP1 (PARG1), was identified by using serological identification of recombinant cDNA expression cloning with sera from RCC patients. PARG1 protein was found to be differentially expressed in RCC cells among patients. High PARG1 expression is significantly correlated with various clinicopathological factors relating to cancer cell proliferation and invasion, including G3 percentage (P = .0046), Ki-67 score (p expression is also correlated with high recurrence of N0M0 patients (P = .0084) and poor prognosis in RCC patients (P = .0345). Multivariate analysis has revealed that high PARG1 expression is an independent factor for recurrence (P = .0149) of N0M0 RCC patients. In in vitro studies, depletion of PARG1by siRNA in human RCC cell lines inhibited their proliferation through inducing G1 cell cycle arrest via upregulation of p53 and subsequent p21Cip1/Waf1, which are mediated by increased RhoA-ROCK activities. Similarly, PARG1 depletion cells inhibited invasion ability via increasing RhoA-ROCK activities in the RCC cell lines. Conversely, overexpression of PARG1 on human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293T promotes its cell proliferation and invasion. These results indicate that PARG1 plays crucial roles in progression of human RCC in increasing cell proliferation and invasion ability via inhibition of the RhoA-ROCK axis, and PARG1 is a poor prognostic marker, particularly for high recurrence of N0M0 RCC patients.",

A-07, U-25, D-12, or R-18 melanoma xenografts were grown in dorsal window chambers and given daily treatments of sunitinib (40 mg/kg) or vehicle. Morphologic parameters of tumor vascular networks were assessed from high-resolution transillumination images, and tumor blood supply times (BSTs) were assessed from first-pass imaging movies. Tumor hypoxia was assessed with immunohistochemistry by using pimonidazole as hypoxia marker, and the gene expression and the protein secretion rate of angiogenic factors were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. The melanoma lines differed substantially in the expression of VEGF-A, VEGF-C, and platelet-derived growth factor A. Sunitinib treatment reduced vessel densities and induced hypoxia in all melanoma lines, and the magnitude of the effect was associated with the gene expression and protein secretion rate of VEGF-A. Sunitinib treatment also increased vessel segment lengths, reduced the number of small-diameter vessels, and inhibited growth-induced increases in the diameter of surviving vessels but did not change BST.

Pathway enrichment analysis and functional annotation determined that the most frequently methylated pathways in HG BC were enriched for anterior/posterior pattern specification, embryonic skeletal system development, neuron fate commitment, DNA binding, and transcription factor activity. We identified 990 probes comprising a 32-gene panel that completely distinguished LG from HG based on methylation.

GP5 and ZSCAN12, two novel methylated genes in BC, were significantly hypermethylated in HG versus LG BC (P\u00a0\u2264\u00a0.03).

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of preoperative intratumoral 18F-FDG uptake heterogeneity (IFH) derived from positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer. METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated clinicopathological data from patients with pathologically proven endometrioid endometrial cancer who had undergone 18F-FDG PET/CT scans before surgery. Patients were divided into two groups according to their IFH. The main outcome measure was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Between January 2010 and January 2015, data from 72 patients were available for analysis. The median duration of DFS was 23 months (range, 6 to 57 months), and 4 (5.6%) patients experienced recurrence. There were significant differences in tumor size, IFH, and DFS between patients with and without recurrence. In regression analysis, high IFH value [P = .007, hazard ratio (HR) 2.545, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.468-8.674] was the only independent risk factor for recurrence. The Kaplan-Meier survival graphs showed that DFS significantly differed in groups categorized based on IFH (P < .001, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative IFH measured by 18F-FDG PET/CT was associated with recurrence of endometrioid endometrial cancer. The finding supports evidence that FDG-based heterogeneity can be a novel and useful predictor of endometrioid endometrial cancer recurrence.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are considered a pivotal target for the eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, we reported that the CSC markers epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and CD90 are expressed independently in primary HCCs and cell lines, and CD90+ cells share features of metastatic vascular endothelial cells and express the vascular endothelial marker CD105, a co-receptor of transforming growth factor-beta. METHODS: The EpCAM+ cell lines HuH1 and HuH7 were treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or epirubicin in vitro. Gene and protein expression levels were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting, respectively. The expression of CD105 in primary HCC was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The relationship of CD105 expression status and HCC prognosis was evaluated using 85 surgically resected HCC tissues by Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis. RESULTS: 5-FU or epirubicin treatment resulted in the generation of CD90+ and CD105+ cells in vitro in HuH1 and HuH7 cells, which originally contain no CD90+ or CD105+ cells. This phenomenon was validated by qRT-PCR analysis with activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) program regulators Snail family zinc finger 1 (SNAI1) and SNAI2. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that CD105+ cells were morphologically identical to vascular endothelial cells in untreated primary HCCs. However, surgically resected specimens after transcatheter arterial chemoembolization clearly indicated that CD105+ cancer cells survived at the peripheral edge of the tumor. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis indicated that HCCs expressing CD105 showed poor prognosis after surgery with statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our data highlight the role of CD105+ HCC cells with activation of the EMT program generated de novo after cytotoxic therapy on the prognosis of HCC patients.",

     "abstract": "The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) protein kinase plays a central role in the cellular response to DNA damage. Loss or inactivation of both copies of the ATM gene (ATM) leads to ataxia telangiectasia, a devastating childhood condition characterized by neurodegeneration, immune deficiencies, and cancer predisposition. ATM is also absent in approximately 40% of mantle cell lymphomas (MCLs), and we previously showed that MCL cell lines with loss of ATM are sensitive to poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Next-generation sequencing of patient tumors has revealed that ATM is altered in many human cancers including colorectal, lung, prostate, and breast. Here, we show that the colorectal cancer cell line SK-CO-1 lacks detectable ATM protein expression and is sensitive to the PARP inhibitor olaparib. Similarly, HCT116 colorectal cancer cells with shRNA depletion of ATM are sensitive to olaparib, and depletion of p53 enhances this sensitivity. Moreover, HCT116 cells are sensitive to olaparib in combination with the ATM inhibitor KU55933, and sensitivity is enhanced by deletion of p53. Together our studies suggest that PARP inhibitors may have potential for treating colorectal cancer with ATM dysfunction and/or colorectal cancer with mutation of p53 when combined with an ATM kinase inhibitor.",

A promoter variant in MUC5B, rs35705950, was previously found to be strongly associated with the incidence of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and also the overall survival (OS) of such patients. Patients with IPF and patients with radiation pneumonitis (RP) have the similar pathologic process and clinical symptoms. However, the role of rs35705950 in patients receiving thoracic radiotherapy remains unclear. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total, 664 patients with NSCLC receiving definitive radiotherapy (total dose \u226560 Gy) were included in our study. RP was scored via the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. OS was the second end point. MUC5B rs35705950 was genotyped, and Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between MUC5B rs35705950 and the risk of RP or OS. RESULTS: The median patient age was 66 years (range 35-88); most (488 [73.2%]) had stage III of the disease. Until the last follow-up, 250 patients developed grade\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 RP, 82 patients developed grade\u00a0\u2265\u00a03 RP, and 440 patients died. The median mean lung dose was 17.9 Gy (range 0.15-32.74). No statistically significant associations were observed between genotypes of MUC5B rs35705950 and the incidence of RP\u00a0\u2265\u00a0grade 2 either in univariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.009, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.728-1.399, P\u00a0=\u00a0.958) or in multivariate analysis (HR 0.921, 95% CI 0.645-1.315, P\u00a0=\u00a0.65). Similar results were also observed for RP\u00a0\u2265\u00a0grade 3, while TT/GT genotypes in MUC5B were significantly associated with poor OS in both univariate analysis (HR 1.287, 95% CI 1.009-1.640, P\u00a0=\u00a0.042) and multivariate analysis (HR 1.561, 95% CI 1.193-2.042, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001).

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: The relationship between endometrial carcinoma and cellular metabolism is unknown. In endometrial cancer, mutation rate of PTEN has been reported very high. Malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) is one of the isoforms of malate dehydrogenase, which is involved in citric acid cycle in mitochondria. Our study aimed to investigate the role MDH2 played in PTEN-regulated endometrial carcinoma. METHODS: To reveal the expression of MDH2 and the co-localization of PTEN and MDH2, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescent staining were used. Western blot, Real-time PCR, RNA interference and overexpression plasmid DNA transfection were performed to investigate the relationship between PTEN and MDH2 as well as the impact of E2 on the expression of PTEN and MDH2, while CCK8, transwell and flow cytometric analysis were carried out to evaluate the proliferation, migration and invasion and apoptosis of endometrial carcinoma cell lines. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that as a metabolism related enzyme, MDH2 was overexpressed in endometrial carcinoma tissues and related to the grade of the cancer (P\u00a0=\u00a0.038). Western blot, Real-time PCR and immunofluorescent staining revealed MDH2 inhibited the expression of PTEN and was co-localized with PTEN in the cytoplasm of endometrial carcinoma. Proliferation, transwell and apoptosis assay suggested that MDH2 enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion but inhibited the apoptosis of endometrial cancer cell line through suppressing PTEN. Furthermore, E2 inhibited the expression level of PTEN but enhanced MDH2 via GPR30. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that MDH2, stimulated by estrogen, was involved in the development of PTEN-regulated endometrial carcinoma through GPR30-related pathway.",

Recent study reported that the levels of miR-489 in late recurrent HCC patients were evidently higher than that in early recurrent cases, suggesting that miR-489 may function as a tumor suppressive miRNA in HCC. Yet, the clinical value and biological function of miR-489 remain rarely known in HCC. Here, we presented that miR-489 level in HCC tissues was notably reduced compared to matched non-cancerous specimens. Its decreased level was evidently correlated with adverse clinical parameters and poor prognosis of HCC patients. Accordingly, the levels of miR-489 were obviously down-regulated in HCC cells. Ectopic expression of miR-489 in HCCLM3 and MHCC97H cells prominently inhibits the migration and invasion of tumor cells and reduced lung metastases in vivo, while miR-489 knockdown increased these behaviors of HepG2 and MHCC97L cells. Mechanically, miR-489 negatively regulated matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP7) abundance in HCC cells. Herein, MMP7 was found to be a downstream molecule of miR-489 in HCC. An inversely correlation between miR-489 and MMP7 was confirmed in HCC specimens. MMP7 knockdown prohibited cell migration and invasion while MMP7 overexpression showed opposite effects on HCC cells. Furthermore, restoration of MMP7 expression could abrogate the anti-metastatic effects of miR-489 on HCCLM3 cells with enhanced cell migration and invasion. Altogether, miR-489 potentially acts as a prognostic predictor and a drug-target for HCC patients.",

     "abstract": "Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a devastating disease with an extremely poor prognosis. Recent studies have shown that platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and its downstream effector pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, are frequently amplified in DIPG, and potential therapies targeting this pathway have emerged. However, the addition of targeted single agents has not been found to improve clinical outcomes in DIPG, and targeting this pathway alone has produced insufficient clinical responses in multiple malignancies investigated, including lung, endometrial, and bladder cancers. Acquired resistance also seems inevitable. Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which shares many nodes of cross talk with the PI3K/AKT pathway, has been implicated in the development of resistance. In the present study, perifosine, a PI3K/AKT pathway inhibitor, and trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, were combined, and their therapeutic efficacy on DIPG cells was assessed. Growth delay assays were performed with each drug individually or in combination. Here, we show that dual inhibition of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways synergistically reduced cell viability. We also reveal that trametinib induced AKT phosphorylation in DIPG cells that could not be effectively attenuated by the addition of perifosine, likely due to the activation of other compensatory mechanisms. The synergistic reduction in cell viability was through the pronounced induction of apoptosis, with some effect from cell cycle arrest. We conclude that the concurrent inhibition of the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK pathways may be a potential therapeutic strategy for DIPG.",

     "abstract": "Radiotherapy is a critical strategy and standard adjuvant approach to glioblastoma treatment. One of the major challenges facing radiotherapy is to minimize radiation damage to normal tissue without compromising therapeutic effects on cancer cells. Various agents and numerous approaches have been developed to improve the therapeutic index of radiotherapy. Among them, radiosensitizers have attracted much attention because they selectively increase susceptibility of cancer cells to radiation and thus enhance biological effectiveness of radiotherapy. However, clinical translation of radiosensitizers has been severely limited by their potential toxicity to normal tissue. Recent advances in nanomedicine offer an opportunity to overcome this hindrance. In this study, a dual functional mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSN) formulation of the valproic acid (VPA) radiosensitizer was developed, which specifically recognized folic acid\u2013overexpressing cancer cells and released VPA conditionally in acidic turmeric microenvironment. The efficacy of this targeted and pH-responsive VPA nanocarrier was evaluated as compared to VPA treatment approach in two cell lines: rat glioma cells C6 and human glioma U87. Compared to VPA treatment, targeted VPA-MSNs not only potentiated the toxic effects of radiation and led to a higher rate of cell death but also enhanced inhibition on clonogenic assay. More interestingly, these effects were further accentuated by VPA-MSNs at low pH values. Western blot analysis showed that the effects were mediated via enhanced apoptosis-inducing effects. Our results suggest that the adjunctive use of VPA-MSNs may enhance the effectiveness of radiotherapy in glioma treatment by lowering the radiation doses required to kill cancer cells and thereby minimize collateral damage to healthy adjacent tissue.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: The prognosis of glioblastoma (GBM) treated with standard-of-care maximal surgical resection and concurrent adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ)/radiotherapy remains very poor (less than 15 months). GBMs have been found to contain a small population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that contribute to tumor propagation, maintenance, and treatment resistance. The highly invasive nature of high-grade gliomas and their inherent resistance to therapy lead to very high rates of recurrence. For these reasons, not all patients with similar diagnoses respond to the same chemotherapy, schedule, or dose. Administration of ineffective anticancer therapy is not only costly but more importantly burdens the patient with unnecessary toxicity and selects for the development of resistant cancer cell clones. We have developed a drug response assay (ChemoID) that identifies the most effective chemotherapy against CSCs and bulk of tumor cells from of a panel of potential treatments, offering great promise for individualized cancer management. Providing the treating physician with drug response information on a panel of approved drugs will aid in personalized therapy selections of the most effective chemotherapy for individual patients, thereby improving outcomes. A prospective study was conducted evaluating the use of the ChemoID drug response assay in GBM patients treated with standard of care. Methods: Forty-one GBM patients (mean age 54 years, 59% male), all eligible for a surgical biopsy, were enrolled in an Institutional Review Board\u2013approved protocol, and fresh tissue samples were collected for drug sensitivity testing. Patients were all treated with standard-of-care TMZ plus radiation with or without maximal surgery, depending on the status of the disease. Patients were prospectively monitored for tumor response, time to recurrence, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Odds ratio (OR) associations of 12-month recurrence, PFS, and OS outcomes were estimated for CSC, bulk tumor, and combined assay responses for the standard-of-care TMZ treatment; sensitivities/specificities, areas under the curve (AUCs), and risk reclassification components were examined. Results: Median follow-up was 8 months (range 3-49 months). For every 5% increase in in vitro CSC cell kill by TMZ, 12-month patient response (nonrecurrence of cancer) increased two-fold, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.2 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.016). Similar but somewhat less supported associations with the bulk tumor test were seen, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.75 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.07) for each 5% bulk tumor cell kill by TMZ. Combining CSC and bulk tumor assay results in a single model yielded a statistically supported CSC association, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.36 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.036), but a much attenuated remaining bulk tumor association, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.46 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.472). AUCs and [sensitivity/specificity] at optimal outpoints (>40% CSC cell kill and >55% bulk tumor cell kill) were AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.989 [sensitivity\u00a0=\u00a0100/specificity\u00a0=\u00a097], 0.972 [100/89], and 0.989 [100/97] for the CSC only, bulk tumor only, and combined models, respectively. Risk categorization of patients was improved by 11% when using the CSC test in conjunction with the bulk test (risk reclassification nonevent net reclassification improvement [NRI] and overall NRI\u00a0=\u00a00.111, P\u00a0=\u00a0.030). Median recurrence time was 20 months for patients with a positive (>40% cell kill) CSC test versus only 3 months for those with a negative CSC test, whereas median recurrence time was 13 months versus 4 months for patients with a positive (>55% cell kill) bulk test versus negative. Similar favorable results for the CSC test were observed for PFS and OS outcomes. Panel results across 14 potential other treatments indicated that 34/41 (83%) potentially more optimal alternative therapies may have been chosen using CSC results, whereas 27/41 (66%) alternative therapies may have been chosen using bulk tumor results. Conclusions: The ChemoID CSC drug response assay has the potential to increase the accuracy of bulk tumor assays to help guide individualized chemotherapy choices. GBM cancer recurrence may occur quickly if the CSC test has a low in vitro cell kill rate even if the bulk tumor test cell kill rate is high.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The skeleton is the most common site of colonization by metastatic cancers. Zoledronic acid (ZA) has been shown to be effective for the treatment of bone metastases regardless of whether the bone lesions are osteolytic or osteoblastic. Biochemical markers of bone turnover may be useful tools to quantify the degree of bone remodeling in the presence of bone metastases. The aim of this work was to establish the correlation between tumor dispersion (bioluminescence) and biochemical markers of bone turnover in two osteolytic and osteoblastic metastasis models in mice. METHODS: The A549M1 cell line that produces osteolytic metastases and the LADOB cell line extracted from a patient with a lung carcinoma and osteoblastic metastases cells were retrovirally transduced with a luciferase reporter gene for in vivo image analysis. Forty-four-week\u2013old mice were inoculated in the left cardiac ventricle with A549M1 or LADOB cells. Twenty mouse of each group were treated with a single dose of ZA (70 \u03bcg/kg) 5 days after i.c. Ten animals of each group were sacrificed at 21 and 28 days postinoculation in A549M1 and 60 and 75 days in the LADOB assay. Bioluminescence analysis was quantified 7, 14, 21 ,and 28 days postinoculation in A549M1 mice and 33, 45, 60, and 75 days after inoculation in LADOB mice. Osteocalcin (BGP), aminoterminal propeptide of procollagen I (PINP), carboxiterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX), and 5b isoenzyme of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase were measured by ELISA (IDS, UK). RESULTS: Bioluminescence imaging revealed a significant increase of tumor burden on time in both osteolytic and osteoblastic mice models. ZA administration resulted in a significant decrease in tumor burden at 21 and 28 days in the A549M1 animals and 60 and 70 days postinoculation in the LADOB line. Biomarkers levels were significantly increased in the untreated group at every point in the osteolytic model. In the osteoblastic model, 2 months after inoculation, all biomarkers were significantly increased. However, 2.5 months postinoculation, only PINP and CTX were significantly increased. Serum bone remodeling markers decreased in ZA-treated mice as compared with tumor groups in both models. With respect to the correlation between bone turnover markers and tumor burden, in the osteolytic model, PINP and BGP demonstrate a strong correlation with bioluminescence in both tumoral and ZA animals, and only CTX was significantly associated with bioluminescence in the group of animals that were not treated with ZA. CONCLUSIONS: We found that the best biomarkers for the diagnosis of both osteolytic and osteoblastic metastasis are formation markers, especially BGP. Moreover, these markers can be useful in the follow-up of the treatment with ZA in both types of metastasis.",

No significant differences in biological functions, including cell proliferation, antigen uptake, phenotype expression, and migration ability, were observed between BMDC and BMDC/NF cells. Combined bioluminescence imaging and I-124 positron emission tomography/computed tomography clearly revealed the migration of BMDC/NF cells to draining popliteal lymph nodes at day 7 postinjection. Interestingly, marked tumor protection was observed in mice immunized with TC-1 lysate-pulsed BMDC/NF cells.

METHODS: Differentially expressed circRNAs were screened between tumor tissues from five GBM patients and five normal brain samples using Illumina Hiseq. Bioinformatics analysis was used to analyze their potential function. CircBRAF was further detected in different WHO grades glioma tissues and normal brain tissues. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox's analysis were used to analyze the association between circBRAF expression level and prognosis of glioma patients. RESULTS: A total of 1411 differentially expressed circRNAs were identified in GBM patients including 206 upregulated circRNAs and 1205 downregulated circRNAs. Differential expression of circRNAs was closely associated with the biological process and molecular function. The downregulated circRNAs were mainly associated with ErbB and Neurotrophin signaling pathways. Moreover, the expression level of circBRAF in normal brain tissues was significantly higher than that in glioma tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). CircBRAF was significantly lower in glioma patients with high pathological grade (WHO III & IV) than those with low grade (WHO I & II) (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Cox analysis revealed that high circBRAF expression was an independent biomarker for predicting good progression-free survival and overall survival in glioma patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.413, 95% CI 0.201-0.849; HR\u00a0=\u00a00.299, 95% CI 0.135-0.661; respectively). CONCLUSION: The present study identified a profile of dysregulated circRNAs in GBM. Bioinformatics analysis showed that dysregulated circRNAs might be associated with tumorigenesis and development of GBM.

This study aimed to investigate the role of RYBP in LC progression and metastasis. In this study, a total of 149 LC patients were recruited, and the clinical stage of their tumors, metastasis status, survival time, presence of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, and RYBP expression levels were measured. RYBP silencing and overexpression were experimentally performed in LC cell lines and in nude mice, and the expressions of genes in EGFR-related signaling pathways and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were detected. The results showed that RYBP was downregulated in LC compared with adjacent normal tissues, and low RYBP expression was associated with a more severe clinical stage, high mortality, high metastasis risk, and poor survival. Cell proliferation and xenograft growth were inhibited by RYBP overexpression, whereas proliferation and xenograft growth were accelerated by RYBP silencing. EGFR and phosphorylated-EGFR levels were upregulated when RYBP was silenced, whereas EGFR, p-EGFR, p-AKT, and p-ERK were downregulated when RYBP was overexpressed. Low RYBP expression was related to a high metastasis risk, and metastasized tumors showed low RYBP levels. Cell migration and invasion were promoted by silencing RYBP but were inhibited by overexpressed RYBP. In addition, the EMT marker vimentin showed diminished expression, and E-cadherin was promoted by the overexpression of RYBP. In conclusion, our data suggest that RYBP suppresses cell proliferation and LC progression by impeding the EGFR-ERK and EGFR-AKT signaling pathways and thereby inhibiting cell migration and invasion and LC metastasis through the suppression of EMT.",

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study on consecutive patients who were diagnosed with mCRC at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. According to their pretreatment ApoA-I level, patients were divided into low\u2013 and high\u2013ApoA-I groups. Propensity score-matched method was performed to balance baseline characteristics between two groups. Based on whether they accepted bevacizumab as a first-line therapy, patients were further divided into the chemo + bevacizumab group and the chemo group. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were assessed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: The optimal cutoff value for the ApoA-I level was determined to be 1.105 g/l. In the propensity-matched cohort of 508 patients, low ApoA-I was significantly associated with inferior OS (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and PFS (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) than high ApoA-I.

PFS (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) in either the high\u2013 or low\u2013ApoA-I groups could be extended significantly after the administration of bevacizumab, and patients with a high ApoA-I level also had a better OS in the chemo + bevacizumab group than the chemo group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.049). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a low ApoA-I level have poor prognoses, and they did not display an OS benefit from bevacizumab.",

     "abstract": "ARQ 087 is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor with potent activity against the FGFR receptor family, currently in Phase I clinical studies for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. The compound has a very safe profile and induces tumor regressions in FGFR-driven models. The feasibility of combining ARQ 087 with chemotherapy was investigated in FGFR deregulated human xenografts. Nude mice were transplanted subcutaneously with H1581, and when tumor masses reached 150 mg, were randomized to receive vehicle, ARQ 087, paclitaxel, carboplatin as single agents or in combination. Similar experimental conditions were applied in nude mice bearing SNU16 and MFE296 xenografts, with the inclusion of capecitabine in the former xenograft model. In the different xenograft models, the drugs given as single agents ranged from very active to partially active. The double combinations were more active than the single ones, but the triple combinations were the most active. In particular, the combination of ARQ 087 + paclitaxel + carboplatin in H1581 bearing mice was able to induce tumor regression in all the mice, with 6/8 mice tumor free at day 140 after tumor transplant. Of note, no toxic deaths nor premature stopping or delaying of drug administration were observed. The data herein reported demonstrated the feasibility of using xenografts models for poli-chemotherapeutic trials mimicking the best standard of care in treatment of specific tumor type and that ARQ 087, a new pan-FGFR inhibitor, can be safely combined with standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs with apparently no sign of cumulative toxicity and an associated increased antitumor effect.",

     "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) was regarded as the most aggressive and mortal subtype of breast cancer (BC) since the molecular subtype system has been established. Abundant studies have revealed that epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) played a pivotal role during breast cancer metastasis and progression, especially in TNBC. Herein, we showed that inhibition the expression of replication factor C subunit 3 (RFC3) significantly attenuated TNBC metastasis and progression, which was associated with EMT signal pathway. In TNBC cells, knockdown of RFC3 can down-regulate mesenchymal markers and up-regulate epithelial markers, significantly attenuated cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Additionally, silencing RFC3 expression can decrease nude mice tumor volume, weight and relieve lung metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that overexpression of RFC3 in TNBC showed increased metastasis, progression and poor prognosis. We confirmed all of these results by immunohistochemistry analysis in 127 human TNBC tissues and found that RFC3 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis in TNBC. Taken all these findings into consideration, we can conclude that up-regulation of RFC3 promotes TNBC progression through EMT signal pathway. Therefore, RFC3 could be an independent prognostic factor and therapeutic target for TNBC.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remains controversial. Additionally, there is no standardized approach or cutoff value for evaluating TIL levels. The aim of this study was to establish a feasible method and criterion to assess TIL levels for future clinical practice and research use and to explore the relationship between TIL levels and prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study reviewed the records and pathological sections of 202 patients with HNSCC who were surgically treated at Beijing Stomatological Hospital, Capital Medical University, from January 1998 to January 2011. The predictor variable was the TIL level. The main outcome assessment parameters were disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULT: The T stage (P = .008), smoking history (P = .042), alcohol history (P = .048), need for radiotherapy (P = .012) and microscopic extracapsular spread (ECS) (P = .012) were associated with the TIL level. A cutoff value equal to 70% could be taken as a threshold for TIL assessment, with a TIL level higher than 70% associated with a better prognosis (DFS rate: 51.9%, P = .018; DSS rate: 59.3%, P = .049). The Cox regression model showed that the TIL level was an independent prognostic factor for DFS (hazard ratio (HR): 0.786, 95% CI: 0.618-0.999, P = .049). CONCLUSION: The TIL level is closely related to the prognosis of patients with HNSCC. A threshold value of 70% is appropriate for TIL assessment, as patients with a TIL level higher than 70% show a better prognosis. Thus, the TIL level might serve as an independent predictor for HNSCC recurrence.",

DCE MRI parameters can differentiate between malignant and benign lesions and predict tumor grading. The purpose of this study was to correlate DCE MRI findings and various histopathological parameters in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with histologically proven HNSCC (11 cases primary tumors and in 5 patients with local tumor recurrence) were included in the study. DCE imaging was performed in all cases and the following parameters were estimated: Ktrans, Ve, Kep, and iAUC. The tumor proliferation index was estimated on Ki 67 antigen stained specimens. Microvessel density parameters (stained vessel area, total vessel area, number of vessels, and mean vessel diameter) were estimated on CD31 antigen stained specimens. Spearman's non-parametric rank sum correlation coefficients were calculated between DCE and different histopathological parameters. RESULTS: The mean values of DCE perfusion parameters were as follows: Ktrans 0.189 \u00b1 0.056 min\u22121, Kep 0.390 \u00b1 0.160 min\u22121, Ve 0.548 \u00b1 0.119%, and iAUC 22.40 \u00b1 12.57.

This study sought to evaluate the important value of the MLR in ovarian cancer patients. METHODS: A total of 133 ovarian cancer patients and 43 normal controls were retrospectively reviewed. The patients' demographics were analyzed along with clinical and pathologic data. The counts of peripheral neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, and platelets were collected and used to calculate the MLR, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). The optimal cutoff value of the MLR was determined by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We compared the MLR, NLR, and PLR between ovarian cancer and normal control patients and among patients with different stages and different grades, as well as between patients with lymph node metastasis and non\u2013lymph node metastasis. We then investigated the value of the MLR in predicting the stage, grade, and lymph node positivity by using logistic regression. The impact of the MLR on overall survival (OS) was calculated by Kaplan-Meier method and compared by log-rank test. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences in the MLR were observed between ovarian cancer patients and normal controls. However, no difference was found for the NLR and PLR. Highly significant differences in the MLR were found among patients with different stages (stage I-II and stage III-IV), grades (G1 and >G1), and lymph node metastasis status. The MLR was a significant and independent risk factor for lymph node metastasis, as determined by logistic regression. The optimal cutoff value of the MLR was 0.23. We also classified the data according to tumor markers (CA125, CA199, HE4, AFP, and CEA) and conventional coagulation parameters (International Normalized Ratio [INR] and fibrinogen). Highly significant differences in CA125, CA199, HE4, INR, fibrinogen levels, and lactate dehydrogenase were found between the low-MLR group (MLR \u2264 0.23) and the high-MLR group (MLR > 0.23). Correspondingly, dramatic differences were observed between the two groups in OS. CONCLUSION: Our results show that the peripheral blood MLR before surgery could be a significant predictor of advanced stages, advanced pathologic grades, and positive lymphatic metastasis in ovarian cancer patients.",

However, LDCT increases the number of indeterminate pulmonary nodules (PNs), whereas 95% of the PNs are ultimately false positives. Modalities for specifically distinguishing between malignant and benign PNs are urgently needed. We previously identified a panel of peripheral blood mononucleated cell (PBMC)-miRNA (miRs-19b-3p and -29b-3p) biomarkers for lung cancer. This study aimed to evaluate efficacy of integrating biomarkers and clinical and radiological characteristics of smokers for differentiating malignant from benign PNs. We analyzed expression of 2 miRNAs (miRs-19b-3p and -29b-3p) in PBMCs of a training set of 137 individuals with PNs. We used multivariate logistic regression analysis to develop a prediction model based on the biomarkers, radiographic features of PNs, and clinical characteristics of smokers for identifying malignant PNs. The performance of the prediction model was validated in a testing set of 111 subjects with PNs. A prediction model comprising the two biomarkers, spiculation of PNs and smoking pack-year, was developed that had 0.91 area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic for distinguishing malignant from benign PNs. The prediction model yielded higher sensitivity (80.3% vs 72.6%) and specificity (89.4% vs 81.9%) compared with the biomarkers used alone (all P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). The performance of the prediction model for malignant PNs was confirmed in the validation set. We have for the first time demonstrated that the integration of biomarkers and clinical and radiological characteristics could efficiently identify lung cancer among indeterminate PNs.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one patients with suspicious hepatic metastases were enrolled in this retrospective study. Two independent radiologists scored visualization of each lesion on a scale of 1 (poor visualization) to 11 (excellent visualization) on 11 sets of images. These included 6 hepatic arterial sub-phases acquired in one breath-hold, 1 series of the mean of 6 hepatic arterial sub-phases, 3 subtracted arterial sub-phases, and 1 portal venous phase. The phases with good (score 8\u201310) and excellent (score 11) lesion visualization were identified, and the number of lesions seen on each of these phases was compared to the number of lesions that was seen best on the equivalent-to-conventional single arterial phase as well as to those that were see best on the mean of 6 hepatic arterial sub-phases. Inter-reader agreement was also calculated. RESULTS: The MA-CDT-VIBE was successfully acquired in 25 patients with hypervascular metastases (96 lesions) and 6 patients with hypovascular metastases (13 lesions). In case of hypervascular metastases, the 6th/6 arterial sub-phase had excellent lesion visualization (sore of 11) in 56 and 44 lesions for the 2 readers, respectively. Good lesion visualization (score of 8-10) was recorded in 5th/6 arterial subphases, in 81 and 67 lesions for the 2 readers, respectively. In case of hypovascular metastases, the portal venous phase had excellent lesion visualization (sore of 11) in all 13 lesions for the 2 readers. Good lesion visualization (score of 8\u201310) was recorded in 12 and 13 lesions on the 5th/6 and 6th/6 arterial subphases, respectively. More hypervascular lesions scored good (score of 8\u201310) and excellent (score of 11) on the 5th/6 and 6th/6 phases of MA-CDT-VIBE compared with the equivalent-to-conventional single arterial phase (3rd/6) and the set with mean of 6 hepatic arterial sub-phases. The results were statistically significant (t test, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Inter-reader agreement was good for hypervascular lesions (kappa\u00a0=\u00a00.627, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) and excellent for hypovascular lesions (kappa\u00a0=\u00a01.0, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The MA-CDT-VIBE improves lesion conspicuity by providing a wide observation window for hypervascular lesions.

METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of the clinical characteristics and patterns of BMs in patients with SCLC. Associations between the clinical characteristics and hippocampal metastases (HMs)/perihippocampal metastases (PHMs) were evaluated in univariate and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 1594 brain metastatic lesions were identified in 180 patients. Thirty-two (17.8%) patients were diagnosed with BMs at the time of primary SCLC diagnosis. The median interval between diagnosis of primary SCLC and BMs was 9.3 months. There were 9 (5.0%) and 22 (12.2%) patients with HMs and PHMs (patients with BMs located in or within 5 mm around the hippocampus), respectively. In the univariate and multivariate analysis, the number of BMs was the risk factor for HMs and PHMs. Patients with BMs\u00a0\u2265\u00a05 had significantly higher risk of HMs (odds ratio [OR] 7.892, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.469-42.404, P\u00a0=\u00a0.016), and patients with BMs\u00a0\u2265\u00a07 had significantly higher risk of PHMs (OR 5.162, 95% CI 2.017-13.213, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001). Patients with extracranial metastases are also associated with HMs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that patients with nonoligometastatic disease are significantly associated with HMs and PHMs. The incidence of PHMs may be acceptably low enough to perform HS-WBRT for SCLC.

Acriflavine (ACF) is an old antibacterial drug recently also suggested as anticancer agent and HIF inhibitor. We wanted to study the effect of acriflavine on EMT in different human cancer models. Pancreatic cancer cells (Panc-1) were exposed to TGF-\u03b21 or cobalt chloride (to mimick severe hypoxia) to induce EMT. For our third model we exposed HepG2 liver cancer cells to sorafenib which resulted in development of acquired drug resistance with strong features of EMT and aggressive behavior. These models were morphologically and functionally (invasion assay) characterized. Markers of EMT were determined using qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Transcriptome analysis was performed following gene expression determination and combining the iRegulon tool and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). We made the following observations: (1) acriflavine inhibited EMT based on changes in cell morphology, invasive capacities and markers of EMT (at protein and gene expression level). (2) Transcriptome analysis revealed potent inhibition of ATF4 target genes and of the unfolded protein response. We showed that acriflavine blocked eIF2a phosphorylation and reduced ATF4 translation thereby inhibiting the PERK/eIF2a/ATF4 UPR pathway. (3) ACF restored drug sensitivity of cells that obtained acquired resistance. Conclusions: We identified acriflavine as a potent inhibitor of EMT and the UPR, thereby re-sensitizing the cancer cells to antineoplastic drugs.",

Fifty-nine glioma tissue samples and seven glioma cell lines were examined for hypermethylation of the MTSS1 promotor, MTSS1 expression levels and gene dosage. GBM cell lines were treated with demethylating agents and interrogated for functional consequences of MTSS1 expression after transient transfection. Hypermethylation was significantly associated with IDH1/2 mutation. Comparative SNP analysis indicates higher incidence of loss of heterozygosity of MTSS1 in anaplastic astrocytomas and secondary glioblastomas as well as hypermethylation of the remaining allele. Reversal of promoter hypermethylation results in an increased MTSS1 expression. Cell motility was significantly inhibited by MTSS1 overexpression without influencing cell growth or apoptosis. Immunofluorescence analysis of MTSS1 in human astrocytes indicates co-localization with actin filaments. MTSS1 is down-regulated by DNA methylation in glioblastoma cell lines and is part of the G-CIMP phenotype in primary glioma tissues.

Cyclin D1 (CCND1), a key driver of malignant transformation in NSCLC, was overexpressed in many cancers, including NSCLC. The ubiquitin specific peptidase-28 (USP28) was also overexpressed in NSCLC and associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. We searched for miR-3940-5p targets by using TargetScan and miRanda online tools and found that CCND1 and USP28 were potential targets of miR-3940-5p. Based on these findings, we speculated that miR-3940-5p might target CCND1 and USP28 to inhibit NSCLC growth. We determined the expression of miR-3940-5p, CCND1, and USP28 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot assays, respectively, and found downregulation of miR-3940-5p and upregulation of CCND1 and USP28 in NSCLC tissues and cell lines. Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays showed that miR-3940-5p suppressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis in NSCLC cells, and silencing CCND1 and USP28 both recapitulated the effects of miR-3940-5p on NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we verified that CCND1 and USP28 were direct targets of miR-3940-5p and also found that the effects of NSCLC cell proliferation and apoptosis by miR-3940-5p were attenuated by overexpression of CCND1 or USP28. The animal experiments also showed that overexpression of miR-3940-5p inhibited the growth of NSCLC tumors in vivo. These results confirmed our speculation that miR-3940-5p inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in NSCLC cells by targeting CCND1 and USP28.

We proposed a 40-gene signature (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a030.71, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) that exhibits better discrimination for prognosis than Lauren classification (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a012.11, P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). FRZB [RR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.824 (1.115-2.986), P\u00a0=\u00a0.017] and EFEMP1 [RR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.537 (0.969-2.437), P\u00a0=\u00a0.067] were identified as independent prognostic factors only in diffuse GC but not in intestinal GC patients. KRT23 [RR (95% CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.616 (0.938-2.785), P\u00a0=\u00a0.083] was identified as an independent prognostic factor only in intestinal GC patients but not in diffuse GC patients. Similar results were achieved in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: We found that GCs with different Lauren classifications had different molecular characteristics and identified FRZB, EFEMP1, and KRT23 as subtype-specific prognostic factors for GC patients.",

We studied their association with N-terminal pro\u2013brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and troponin T (TnT) during abiraterone therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a single institution, 17 patients were treated with abiraterone acetate 1 g daily with concomitant prednisone and then switched to dexametasone plus canrenone. Blood samples for PSA, NT-proBNP, and TnT were obtained at baseline and after 1, 3, and 6 months. RESULTS: Five patients (29.4%) experienced G3 to 4 cardiac SAEs after a median of 13 weeks (range, 9-32), including pulmonary edema, heart failure, acute coronary syndrome, sinus bradycardia with syncope, and pulmonary edema. At baseline, 4 weeks, and 3 months, median NT-proBNP and TnT levels were higher in patients with subsequent cardiac SAEs (P= .03 and P= .04 for NT-proBNP and TnT at 3 months, respectively). After switching to dexametasone and introducing canrenone, no additional cardiac SAEs were noted. Overall response rate was 67%. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests a higher than expected risk of cardiac SAEs during abiraterone treatment which may well be due to the small sample size and the unrestricted entry criteria. However, baseline and frequent NT-proBNP and TnT monitoring predicted a higher risk for cardiac SAE. Larger studies should confirm our findings.",

     "abstract": "The sterile alpha motif and leucine zipper containing kinase ZAK (AZK, MLT, MLK7), is a MAPK-kinase kinase (MKKK). Like most MAPKKKs which are known to activate the c-Jun. amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, ZAK has been shown to participate in the transduction of Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-mediated non-canonical signaling. A role for ZAK in SMAD-dependent, canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling has not been previously appreciated. Using a combination of functional genomics and biochemical techniques, we demonstrate that ZAK regulates canonical TGF\u03b2RI/II signaling in lung and breast cancer cell lines and may serve as a key node in the regulation of TGFBR kinase activity. Remarkably, we demonstrate that siRNA mediated depletion of ZAK strongly inhibited TGF-\u03b2 dependent SMAD2/3 activation and subsequent promoter activation (SMAD binding element driven luciferase expression; SBE4-Luc). A ZAK specific inhibitor (DHP-2), dose-dependently activated the bioluminescent TGFBR-kinase activity reporter (BTR), blocked TGF-\u03b2 induced SMAD2/3 phosphorylation and SBE4-Luc activation and cancer cell-invasion. In aggregate, these findings identify a novel role for the ZAK kinase in canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling and an invasive cancer cell phenotype thus providing a novel target for TGF-\u03b2 inhibition.",

We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of ND in patients with gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: A single-center cohort of 1026 GC patients undergoing curative resection between 2003 and 2012 was categorized to ND and nutritionally replete (NR) groups. Patients with body mass index <18.5 kg/m2, preoperative albumin <35 g/l, or preoperative weight loss \u22655% of body weight were defined as ND. RESULTS: Of the 1026 patients included in the study, 585 (57.0%) were categorized as ND. Overall survival (OS) at 5 years was 68.5% for ND patients and 44.0% for NR patients (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that ND was a significant predictor of OS (hazard ratio: 1.954; 95% confidence interval: 1.552-2.460; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In stage-stratified analysis, it was still independently associated with OS in tumor-nodes-metastasis stage II and III (P\u00a0=\u00a0.004 and P\u00a0<\u00a0.001, respectively). Of note, the prognostic significance of ND was still maintained when stratified by age, sex, anemia, and adjuvant chemotherapy (all Ps\u00a0<\u00a0.05).

     "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play pivotal roles in the initiation and progression of cancer, including esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR) was reported to be dysregulated and correlated with the progression of ESCC. However, the biological role and the underlying mechanism of HOTAIR in the development of ESCC remain unclear. Herein, we found that HOTAIR was aberrantly upregulated in ESCC cells and that HOTAIR depletion inhibited proliferation and led to G1 cell cycle arrest in ESCC cells. Besides, we found that HOTAIR acted as an endogenous sponge to downregulate miR-1 expression by directly binding to miR-1. Furthermore, HOTAIR overturned the effect of miR-1 on the proliferation and cell cycle profile in ESCC cells, which involved the derepression of cyclin D1 (CCND1) expression, a target of miR-1. Taken together, our study elucidated a novel HOTAIR /miR-1/CCND1 regulatory axis in which HOTAIR acted as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging miR-1 and upregulated CCND1 expression, thereby facilitating the tumorigenesis of ESCC. Investigation of this lncRNA/miRNA/mRNA pathway may contribute to a better understanding of ESCC pathogenesis and facilitate the development of lncRNA-directed therapy against this disease.",

METHODS: Specifically, the therapeutic efficacy of combination of CDDP and HPV16 E6 + E7-CRISPR/Cas9 was assessed in cervical cancer cells and cervical cancer xenograft models. RESULTS: In vitro experiments showed that long-term exposure of SiHa cells to the HPV16 E6 + E7-CRISPR/Cas9 induced apoptosis, and its pro-apoptosis effect became more obvious when combined with CDDP. In vivo study found the efficacy of the combination of HPV16 E6 + E7-CRISPR/Cas9 and CDDP were superior to either of the treatments in term of apoptosis induction and metastasis inhibition.

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a treatment option in the second- or third-line palliative setting in EGFR wild-type (wt) non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, response rates are low, and only approximately 25% will achieve disease control. Early prediction of treatment resistance could accelerate discontinuation of ineffective treatment and reduce unnecessary toxicity. In this study, we evaluated early changes on 18F-fluoro-D-glucose (F-18-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) and in total plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as markers of erlotinib response in EGFR-wt patients. METHODS: F-18-FDG-PET/CT scans and blood samples were obtained prior to erlotinib initiation and were repeated after 1 week (PET/CT) and 1 to 4 weeks (blood sample) of treatment. Level of cfDNA was measured by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction. Percentage change (%\u2206) in SULpeak and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) on FDG-PET/CT and in plasma cfDNA was correlated to radiological response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Fifty patients were prospectively enrolled. A significant correlation was found between CT response and %\u2206TLG (P\u00a0=\u00a0.003). All patients with early metabolic progression showed radiological progression. Increased %\u2206TLG and %\u2206cfDNA were significantly correlated with shorter PFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.004, respectively) and OS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.009 and P\u00a0=\u00a0.009, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated %\u2206cfDNA to be the strongest predictor of OS. CONCLUSION: Early increase in TLG on F-18-FDG-PET/CT correlates with radiological progression, and shorter PFS and OS. Early increase in cfDNA predicts shorter PFS and OS. Both assessments are promising tools for early detection of nonresponders and reduced OS in TKI-treated EGFR-wt NSCLC patients.",

     "abstract": "Succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) is a heterotetrameric complex, among which the catalytic core SDHB loss-of-function mutations lead to mitochondrial enzyme SDH dysfunction and are associated with cancer formation. However, the impact of SDHB loss on colorectal carcinoma and the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, we found a coherent decreased SDHB expression both in human colorectal cancer (CRC) samples and CRC cell lines. Combined clinical analysis in a cohort of 43 CRC patients demonstrated a correlation between reduced SDHB activity and a more advanced clinical phenotype regarding lymphatic and distant metastasis. Applying genetic interference and cellular function approaches, we found that knocking down SDHB promoted cell migration and invasion through enabling epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and inverse results of SDHB overexpression further confirmed our theory. Mechanical exploration revealed that SDHB knockdown could activate TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, more precisely through up-regulation of a tight-junction transcriptional repression complex SNAIL1-SMAD3/SMAD4, thus contributed to the increase in metastasis. In conclusion by identifying SNAIL1-SMAD3/SMAD4 as essential for the TGF\u03b2-mediated tumorigenic capacity in SDHB-deficient CRC cells, this study revealed a critical mechanical vulnerability for potential future therapeutic target of SDHB-associated CRC.",

We compared the behaviors of multispectral (MS) and conventional red-green-blue (RGB) images on assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) immunohistochemistry to explore their impact on outcome in patients with invasive breast cancer (BC). Tissue microarrays containing 240 BC patients were introduced to compare the performance of MS and RGB imaging methods on the quantitative assessment of HER2 status and the prognostic value of 5-year disease-free survival (5-DFS). Both the total and average signal optical density values of HER2 MS and RGB images were analyzed, and all patients were divided into two groups based on the different 5-DFS. The quantification of HER2 MS images was negatively correlated with 5-DFS in lymph node\u2013negative and \u2013positive patients (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), but RGB images were not in lymph node\u2013positive patients (P\u00a0=\u00a0.101).

We selectively genotyped 11 independent, potentially functional SNPs of 9 genes in the JNK and P38\u03b1 pathways first in a discovery group of 355 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with PBC, and we evaluated their associations with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Then, resultant significant SNPs were further validated in a replication group of 355 patients.

We found that platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR-\u03b2) activity was upregulated in three xenograft-derived IGF-1R antibody-resistant cell lines that arose from a highly sensitive fusion-positive RMS cell line (Rh41). Furthermore, we identified four additional fusion-negative RMS cell lines that similarly upregulated PDGFR-\u03b2 activity when selected for IGF-1R antibody resistance in vitro. In the seven cell lines described, we observed enhanced growth inhibition when cells were treated with dual IGF-1R and PDGFR-\u03b2 inhibition in vitro. In vivo studies have confirmed the enhanced effect of targeting IGF-1R and PDGFR-\u03b2 in several mouse xenograft models of fusion-negative RMS. These findings suggest that PDGFR-\u03b2 acts as a bypass resistance pathway to IGF-1R inhibition in a subset of RMS.

However, given the rarity of noncutaneous melanoma, including acral and mucosal subtypes, the efficacy of BRAF inhibitors for this subset of patients has not been extensively investigated. Acquired resistance generally appears 6 to 8 months after treatment with a BRAF inhibitor, and the mechanism of resistance is not well established. METHODS: We examined treatment outcomes for patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma and treated with BRAF inhibitors at Samsung Medical Center between April 2013 and December 2015. We analyzed genomic alterations in selected patients using targeted sequencing. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients with a median age of 49 years (range 23-82 years) with metastatic melanoma and treated with a BRAF inhibitor were identified. Of these patients, 19 (70.3%) had noncutaneous melanoma, including acral and mucosal melanoma. All patients had BRAFV600E mutations. The median progression-free survival of all patients was 9.2 months (95% confidence interval, 1.6-16.7), and the objective response rate was 78.9% in the mucosal/acral melanoma group and 75.0% in the cutaneous melanoma group. Three (11.1%) patients achieved complete response, and 19 (70.4%) showed a partial response. Targeted sequencing in five patients demonstrated NF1 mutations in three patients who did not respond to BRAF inhibitors.

Although p19Arf is sufficient to induce cell death, only its pairing with IFN\u03b2 significantly induced markers of immunogenic cell death. In situ gene therapy with IFN\u03b2, either alone or in combination with p19Arf, could retard tumor progression, but only the combined treatment was associated with a protective immune response. Specifically in the case of combined intratumoral gene transfer, we identified 167 differentially expressed genes when using microarray to evaluate tumors that were treated in vivo and confirmed the activation of CCL3, CXCL3, IL1\u03b1, IL1\u03b2, CD274, and OSM, involved in immune response and chemotaxis. Histologic evaluation revealed significant tumor infiltration by neutrophils, whereas functional depletion of granulocytes ablated the antitumor effect of our approach. The association of in situ gene therapy with cisplatin resulted in synergistic elimination of tumor progression. In all, in situ gene transfer with p19Arf and IFN\u03b2 acts as an immunotherapy involving recruitment of neutrophils, a desirable but previously untested outcome, and this approach may be allied with chemotherapy, thus providing significant antitumor activity and warranting further development for the treatment of lung carcinoma.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the combined prognostic role of three frequent molecular alterations in prostate cancer, namely relative 8q gain, ERG overexpression, and loss of PTEN expression, in a series of 136 patients with prostate cancer treated with prostatectomy and with a long follow-up. Fluorescent in situ hybridization was used to detect the relative copy number of 8q and immunohistochemistry was used for quantitative assessment of ERG and PTEN expression. During a median follow-up period of 117.8 months, 66 (49%) patients had disease recurrence. Relative 8q gain, ERG overexpression, and loss of PTEN expression were observed in 18%, 56%, and 33% of the cases, respectively. No association with patient recurrence-free survival was found for relative 8q gain or ERG overexpression on their own, whereas loss of PTEN expression was associated with worse recurrence-free survival (P\u00a0=\u00a0.006). Interestingly, in the subgroup of patients with normal PTEN expression, we found that the combined relative 8q gain/ERG overexpression is associated with high risk of recurrence (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008), suggesting that alternative mechanisms exist for progression into clinically aggressive disease. Additionally, in intermediate-risk patients with normal PTEN expression in their tumors, the combination of 8q gain/ERG overexpression was associated with a poor recurrence-free survival (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), thus indicating independent prognostic value.

The oncogenic role and prognostic value of PHGDH have been investigated in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer, and colon cancer. Due to the importance of PHGDH in cancer, we attempted to determine the clinical significance of PHGDH in 319 patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated the mRNA and protein expression levels of PHGDH gene, using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and tissue array\u2013based immunohistochemistry, respectively. Significantly increased PHGDH expression in mRNA and protein levels was identified in tumor tissues versus matched adjacent nontumor tissues. More interestingly, immunohistochemical expression of PHGDH was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a0.021) and TNM stage (P\u00a0=\u00a0.016). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that NSCLC patients with low levels of PHGDH outperformed patients with high levels of PHGDH regarding 5-year overall survival. Significantly longer survival in the former suggested the prognostic implication of PHGDH in NSCLC. Multivariate survival analysis using Cox regression model demonstrated that high PHGDH levels and advanced TNM stage (III\u00a0+\u00a0IV) were independent predictors of prognosis in NSCLC. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis confirmed the increase in PHGDH transcripts (data from The Cancer Genome Atlas) and its prognostic value (Kaplan-Meier plotter) in NSCLC. In conclusion, this study suggested the clinical implication of PHGDH in NSCLC. PHGDH may be a promising therapeutic target in NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "Bladder cancer presents as either low- or high-grade disease, each with distinct mutational profiles; however, both display prominent mTORC1 activation. One major negative regulator of mTORC1 is AMPK, which is a critical metabolic regulator that suppresses cellular growth in response to metabolic stress by negatively regulating mTORC1. Alterations in the activation and protein levels of AMPK have been reported in breast, gastric, and hepatocellular carcinoma. To investigate whether AMPK suppression is responsible for mTOR activation in bladder cancer, the levels of AMPK\u03b1 were quantified in a cohort of primary human bladder cancers and adjacent nontumor tissues. The levels of p-AMPK\u03b1, AMPK\u03b11, AMPK\u03b12, and total AMPK\u03b1 were significantly suppressed in both low- and high-grade disease when compared with nontumor tissue. To elucidate the AMPK\u03b1 suppression mechanism, we focused on inflammation, particularly tumor-infiltrating macrophages, due to their reported role in regulating AMPK expression. Treatment of HTB2 cancer cells with varying doses of differentiated U937 macrophage conditioned medium (CM) demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction of AMPK\u03b1 protein. Additionally, macrophage CM treatment of HTB2 and HT1376 bladder cells for various times also reduced AMPK\u03b1 protein but not mRNA levels. Direct TNF\u03b1 treatment also suppressed AMPK\u03b1 at the protein but not RNA level. Finally, staining of the human cohort for CD68, a macrophage marker, revealed that CD68+ cell counts correlated with reduced AMPK\u03b1 levels. In summary, these data demonstrate the potential role for inflammation and inflammatory cytokines in regulating the levels of AMPK\u03b1 and promoting mTORC1 activation in bladder cancer.",

All patients underwent contrast-enhanced imaging (MRI: n= 10 and CT: n= 4) 3 to 4 weeks pre- and posttreatment. Response to treatment was evaluated on the arterial phase using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), World Health Organization, modified RECIST, EASL, tumor volume, and qEASL. Paired t test was used to compare measurements pre- and post-IAT. Patients were stratified into responders (\u226565% decrease in qEASL) and nonresponders (<65% decrease in qEASL). OS was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test and the Cox proportional hazard model.Mean qEASL (cm3) decreased from 93.5 to 67.2 cm3 (P= .004) and mean qEASL (%) from 63.1% to 35.6% (P= .001). No significant changes were observed using other response criteria. qEASL was the only significant predictor of OS when used to stratify patients into responders and nonresponders with median OS of 31.9 versus 11.1 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.97; P= .042) for qEASL (cm3) and 29.9 versus 10.2 months (HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.74; P= .025) for qEASL (%).Three-dimensional (3D) quantitative tumor analysis is a reliable predictor of OS when assessing treatment response after IAT in patients with RCC metastatic to the liver. qEASL outperforms conventional non-3D methods and can be used as a surrogate marker for OS early after therapy.",

In this study, we characterize the role of pericentriolar material 1 (PCM1), a component of centriolar satellites surrounding centrosomes, in GBM cell proliferation and sensitivity to genotoxic agents such as TMZ. We show that PCM1 is expressed around centrioles and ciliary basal bodies in patient GBM biopsies and derived cell lines and that its localization is dynamic throughout the cell cycle. To test whether PCM1 mediates GBM cell proliferation and/or response to TMZ, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to generate primary GBM cell lines depleted of PCM1. These PCM1-depleted cells displayed reduced AZI1 satellite protein localization and significantly decreased proliferation, which was attributable to increased apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, PCM1-depleted lines were more sensitive to TMZ toxicity than control lines. The increase in TMZ sensitivity may be partly due to the reduced ability of PCM1-depleted cells to form primary cilia, as depletion of KIF3A also ablated GBM cells' ciliogenesis and increased their sensitivity to TMZ while preserving PCM1 localization. In addition, the co-depletion of KIF3A and PCM1 did not have any additive effect on TMZ sensitivity. Together, our data suggest that PCM1 plays multiple roles in GBM pathogenesis and that associated pathways could be targeted to augment current or future anti-GBM therapies.",

Recent studies were able to distinguish malignant from benign nodules of the thyroid gland with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Although this differentiation is undoubtedly helpful, presurgical discrimination between well-differentiated and undifferentiated carcinomas would be crucial to define the optimal treatment algorithm. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate if readout-segmented multishot echo planar DWI is able to differentiate between differentiated and undifferentiated subtypes of thyroid carcinomas. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen patients with different types of thyroid carcinomas who received preoperative DWI were included in our study. In all lesions, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)min, ADCmean, ADCmax, and D were estimated on the basis of region of interest measurements after coregistration with T1-weighted, postcontrast images. All tumors were resected and analyzed histopathologically. Ki-67 index, p53 synthesis, cellularity, and total and average nucleic areas were estimated using ImageJ version 1.48. RESULTS: Analysis of variance revealed a statistically significant difference in ADCmean values between differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas (P\u00a0=\u00a0.022). Spearman Rho calculation identified significant correlations between ADCmax and cell count (r\u00a0=\u00a00.541, P\u00a0=\u00a0.046) as well as between ADCmax and total nuclei area (r\u00a0=\u00a00.605, P\u00a0=\u00a0.022).

G0 and early G1 phases, typical of slow-growing cells, can be detected by minichromosome maintenance protein (MCM) expression. We hypothesized that these replication licensing markers may provide clinically relevant information to augment Ki67 in low-grade neuroendocrine neoplasia. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining (IHC), Western blot analysis, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and copy number variations of MCM2, MCM3, and Ki67 were undertaken in SI-NENs (n = 22). MCM and Ki67 expression was compared by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (tissue microarray, independent set [n = 55]). Forty-three pancreatic NENs and 14 normal tissues were included as controls. RESULTS: In SI-NENs, MCM2 (mean: 21.2%: range: 16%-25%) and MCM3 (28.7%: 22%-34%) were detected in significantly more cells than Ki67 (2.3%: 0%-7%, P < .01). MCM2 mRNA correlated with Ki67 IHC (P < .05). MCM3 protein expression was higher in metastases (38-fold) than in normal small intestine (P = .06) and was largely absent in normal neuroendocrine cells. There was considerable variation at the MCM copy number level (0-4 copies). MCM3 expression in proliferating cells significantly predicted overall survival (P < .002). Combinations of Ki67 and MCM2/3 in algorithms differentiated low and higher proliferative lesions (overall survival: 12 vs 6.1 years, P = .06). MCM expression was not informative in pancreatic NENs. CONCLUSION: MCMs are expressed in a higher proportion of NEN cells than Ki67 in slow-growing small intestinal lesions and correlate with survival. Assessment can be used to augment Ki67 to improve prognostic classification in these low-grade tumors.",

Genetically engineered oncolytic viruses, such as herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV), are currently being explored as treatments for pediatric tumors. M002, an oncolytic HSV, has both copies of the \u03b3134.5 gene deleted, enabling replication in tumor cells but thwarting infection of normal, postmitotic cells. We hypothesized that M002 would infect human RMS tumor cells and lead to decreased tumor cell survival in vitro and impede tumor growth in vivo. In the current study, we demonstrated that M002 could infect, replicate in, and decrease cell survival in both embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) cells. Additionally, M002 reduced xenograft tumor growth and increased animal survival in both ARMS and ERMS. Most importantly, we showed for the first time that repeated dosing of oncolytic virus coupled with low-dose radiation provided improved tumor response in RMS. These findings provide support for the clinical investigation of oncolytic HSV in pediatric RMS.",

METHOD AND MATERIALS: All experiments were approved by the local Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. FVB mice with orthotopic PDAC were treated daily with an i.p. injection of losartan (70 mg/kg) or saline (control vehicle) for 5 days. In order to calculate the fractional blood volume, vessel size index, and vessel density index, MRI was performed at 4.7 T following the injection of 3 mg/kg iron ferumoxytol (i.v.). Dynamic PET images were also acquired for 60 minutes using an 18F-5FU tracer dose of 200 \u03bcCi and analyzed for time activity curves normalized to muscle. Statistical analyses compared both cohorts using an unpaired two-tailed t test.

Losartan also induced a significant increase in the intratumoral uptake of 18F-5FU by 53% (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). CONCLUSION: MRI using FDA-approved MNPs provides a noninvasive, translatable means of assaying microvascular parameters induced by losartan in pancreatic cancer.

Expression of this Wnt receptor correlated with metastatic disease and poor disease-free survival. Forced expression of dominant-negative LRP5 (dnLRP5), which lacks the membrane binding domain of the native protein and therefore functions as a soluble receptor-sponge for Wnt ligands, reduced in vitro cellular invasion and in vivo xenograft tumor growth for osteosarcoma cell lines. Here, we use a genetically engineered mouse model of osteosarcomagenesis with and without expression of dnLRP5 to assess to what degree tumorigenesis is affected and whether Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is circumvented or maintained. Each cohort of mice developed osteosarcoma at a similar ultimate prevalence, but after a slightly increased latency in those also expressing dnLRP5. On histology, there was no difference between groups, despite previous reports that the dnLRP5 osteosarcoma cells specifically undergo a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition in vitro. Finally, immunohistochemistry showed the presence of cytosolic and nuclear \u03b2-catenin and nuclear Cyclin D1, markers consistent with preserved Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling despite constitutive blockade of the cell surface receipt of Wnt signaling ligand. These data suggest that canonical Wnt signaling plays a role in OS progression and that while blockade of singular nodes in signaling pathways can have dramatic effects on individual cell lines, real tumors readily evade such focused attacks.",

The study was performed on 85 CRLM tumor samples.

Finally, 28 CRLM tumor samples were used to confirm and validate the results obtained. Based on all the protein peaks detected in the training group, the CART analysis was generated, and four peaks were considered to be the most relevant to construct a diagnostic algorithm. Indeed, the multivariate model yielded a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 86.1%, respectively. In addition, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy to discriminate mild from severe CRLM patients (area under the ROC: 0.903).

Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is frequently up-regulated in HCC and plays an important role in HCC tumorigenesis. Tumors with loss of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), a negative regulator of mTOR signaling, tend to respond well to mTOR inhibitors. We analyzed TSC2 expression status in Korean patients with HCC and evaluated the correlation between TSC2 loss and response to the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus. METHODS: We retrospectively assessed 36 patients with advanced HCC who had received sorafenib at a single center in Korea between 2008 and 2014, and for whom tumor specimens were available for TSC2 immunohistochemical analysis (IHC). Three patient-derived tumor cell lines (PDCs) were analyzed by western blotting to determine TSC2 expression and drug sensitivity to mTOR. RESULTS: Twelve of 36 patients (33.3%) showed low to undetectable levels of TSC2 expression. No significant differences were observed in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival with sorafenib treatment based on TSC2 expression status. Two patients were treated with everolimus after sorafenib failure; one patient, with moderate TSC2 expression, experienced stable disease with a PFS of 5.8 months; the other, with high TSC2 expression, experienced rapid progression. PDC models demonstrated that the TSC2-low HCC PDC line was significantly more sensitive to everolimus than the TSC2-high HCC PDC lines. CONCLUSION: Loss of TSC2 may predict improved response to everolimus in HCC patients, but further studies are needed to confirm the predictive role of TSC2 expression for everolimus treatment.",

Here, the methodologies used for detecting circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from CRC are reviewed. In addition to the traditional CRC biomarkers, the persistent presence of posttherapeutic CTCs indicates resistance to adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; hence, CTCs also play a decisive role in the subsequent relapse of CRC. Moreover, the genetic and phenotypic profiling of CTCs often differs from that of the primary tumor; this difference can be used to select the most effective targeted therapy. Consequently, studying CTCs can potentially individualize treatment strategies for patients with CRC. Therefore, CTC detection and characterization may be valuable tools for refining prognosis, and CTCs can be used in a real-time tumor biopsy for designing individually tailored therapy against CRC.",

Current screening techniques are based on the measurement of serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) levels and digital rectal examination. A decisive diagnosis of PCa is based on prostate biopsies; however, this approach can lead to false-positive and false-negative results. Therefore, it is important to discover new biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCa, preferably noninvasive ones. Metabolomics is an approach that allows the analysis of the entire metabolic profile of a biological system. As neoplastic cells have a unique metabolic phenotype related to cancer development and progression, the identification of dysfunctional metabolic pathways using metabolomics can be used to discover cancer biomarkers and therapeutic targets. In this study, we review several metabolomics studies performed in prostatic fluid, blood plasma/serum, urine, tissues and immortalized cultured cell lines with the objective of discovering alterations in the metabolic phenotype of PCa and thus discovering new biomarkers for the diagnosis of PCa. Encouraging results using metabolomics have been reported for PCa, with sarcosine being one of the most promising biomarkers identified to date. However, the use of sarcosine as a PCa biomarker in the clinic remains a controversial issue within the scientific community. Beyond sarcosine, other metabolites are considered to be biomarkers for PCa, but they still need clinical validation. Despite the lack of metabolomics biomarkers reaching clinical practice, metabolomics proved to be a powerful tool in the discovery of new biomarkers for PCa detection.",

We also examined the effects of FAK inhibition upon two RMS cell lines utilizing parallel approaches including RNAi and small molecule inhibitors. FAK inhibition resulted in decreased cellular survival, invasion, and migration and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, small molecule inhibition of FAK led to decreased tumor growth in a nude mouse RMS xenograft model. The findings from this study will help to further our understanding of the regulation of tumorigenesis in RMS and may provide desperately needed novel therapeutic strategies for these difficult-to-treat tumors.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Identification of high-grade meningiomas in preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is important for optimized surgical strategy and best possible resection. Numerous studies investigated subjectively determined morphological features as predictors of tumor biology in meningiomas. The aim of this study was to identify the predictive value of more reliable, quantitatively measured signal intensities in MRI for differentiation of high- and low-grade meningiomas and identification of meningiomas with high proliferation rates, respectively. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six patients (56 World Health Organization [WHO] grade I, 9 WHO grade II, and 1 WHO grade I) were included in the study. Preoperative MRI signal intensities (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery [FLAIR], T1 precontrast, and T1 postcontrast as genuine and normalized values) were correlated with Ki-67 expression in tissue sections of resected meningiomas. Differences between the groups (analysis of variance) and Spearman rho correlation were computed using SPSS 22. RESULTS: Mean values of genuine signal intensities of meningiomas in FLAIR, T1 native, and T1 postcontrast were 323.9 \u00b1 59, 332.8 \u00b1 67.9, and 768.5 \u00b1 165.3. Mean values of normalized (to the contralateral white matter) signal intensities of meningiomas in FLAIR, T1 native, and T1 postcontrast were 1.5 \u00b1 0.3, 0.8 \u00b1 0.1, and 1.9 \u00b1 0.4. There was no significant correlation between MRI signal intensities and WHO grade or Ki-67 expression. Signal intensities did not differ significantly between WHO grade I and II/III meningiomas. Ki-67 expression was significantly increased in high-grade meningiomas compared with low-grade meningiomas (P < 0.01). Objectively measured values of MRI signal intensities (FLAIR, T1 precontrast, and T1 postcontrast enhancement) did not distinguish between high-grade and low-grade meningiomas. Furthermore, there was no association between MRI signal intensities and Ki-67 expression representing proliferative activity.",

In this study, we sought to present the underrecognized CRC with the residual polyp of origin (CRC RPO\u00a0+) as an entity to be utilized as a model to study colorectal carcinogenesis. We identified all subjects with biopsy-proven CRC RPO\u00a0+ that were evaluated over 10 years at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, and compared their clinical and pathologic characteristics to CRC without remnant polyps (CRC RPO\u00a0\u2212). Overall survival and disease-free survival overlap with an equivalent hazard ratio between CRC RPO\u00a0+ and RPO\u00a0\u2212 cases when age, stage, and grade are adjusted. The somatic genomic profile obtained by whole genome sequencing and the gene expression profiles by RNA-seq for CRC RPO\u00a0+ tumors were compared with that of age -and gender-matched CRC RPO\u00a0\u2212 evaluated by The Cancer Genome Atlas. CRC RPO\u00a0+ cases were more commonly found with lower-grade, earlier-stage disease than CRC RPO\u00a0\u2212. However, within the same disease stage and grade, their clinical course is very similar to that of CRC RPO\u00a0\u2212. The mutation frequencies of commonly mutated genes in CRC are similar between CRC RPO\u00a0+ and RPO\u00a0\u2212 cases. Likewise, gene expression patterns are indistinguishable between the RPO\u00a0+ and RPO\u00a0\u2212 cases. We have confirmed that CRC RPO\u00a0+ is clinically and biologically similar to CRC RPO\u00a0\u2212 and may be utilized as a model of the adenoma to carcinoma transition.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of anatomic and volumetric functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in early assessment of response to trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) in hypovascular liver metastases. METHODS: This retrospective study included 52 metastatic lesions (42 targeted and 10 non-targeted) in 17 patients who underwent MRI before and early after TACE. Two reviewers reported response by anatomic criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor [RECIST], modified RECIST [mRECIST], and European Association for the Study of Liver Disease [EASL]) and functional criteria (volumetric apparent diffusion coefficient and contrast enhancement). Treatment endpoint was RECIST at 6 months. A 2-sample paired t test was used to compare the mean changes after intra-arterial therapy. P < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Reduction in mRECIST and EASL at 1 month was significant in the whole cohort as well as in responders by RECIST at 6 months, and the changes fulfilled partial response criteria for both metrics in responders. Responders also had significant changes in volumetric apparent diffusion coefficient (P = .01 and P = .03) and contrast enhancement (P < .0001 and P < .0001) at 1 month for both readers, respectively. CONCLUSION: At 1 month post treatment, responders did not fulfill RECIST criteria but fulfilled mRECIST and EASL criteria. In addition, volumetric contrast-enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI may be helpful in evaluating early treatment response after TACE in hypovascular liver metastases in patients who have failed to respond to initial chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Earlier detection of transformed cells using target-specific imaging techniques holds great promise. We have developed TAB 004, a monoclonal antibody highly specific to a protein sequence accessible in the tumor form of MUC1 (tMUC1). We present data assessing both the specificity and sensitivity of TAB 004 in vitro and in genetically engineered mice in vivo. METHODS: Polyoma Middle T Antigen mice were crossed to the human MUC1.Tg mice to generate MMT mice. In MMT mice, mammary gland hyperplasia is observed between 6 and 10 weeks of age that progresses to ductal carcinoma in situ by 12 to 14 weeks and adenocarcinoma by 18 to 24 weeks. Approximately 40% of these mice develop metastasis to the lung and other organs with a tumor evolution that closely mimics human breast cancer progression. Tumor progression was monitored in MMT mice (from ages 8 to 22 weeks) by in vivo imaging following retro-orbital injections of the TAB 004 conjugated to indocyanine green (TAB-ICG). At euthanasia, mammary gland tumors and normal epithelial tissues were collected for further analyses. RESULTS: In vivo imaging following TAB-ICG injection permitted significantly earlier detection of tumors compared with physical examination. Furthermore, TAB-ICG administration in MMT mice enabled the detection of lung metastases while sparing recognition of normal epithelia. CONCLUSIONS: The data highlight the specificity and the sensitivity of the TAB 004 antibody in differentiating normal versus tumor form of MUC1 and its utility as a targeted imaging agent for early detection, tumor monitoring response, as well as potential clinical use for targeted drug delivery.",

The complexity of the EGF system with four interacting receptors and more than a dozen activating ligands is a likely explanation. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the combined network of receptors and ligands from the EGF system is a prognostic marker. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gene expression of the receptors EGFR, HER2, HER3, HER4, and the ligands AREG, HB-EGF, EPI, TGF-\u03b1, and EGF was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction in tumor samples from 100 NSCLC patients without EGFR activating mutations. Results were dichotomized into high or low levels of target expression. Coexpression of the ligands and receptors was observed, and a score was developed based on the summed effect of receptors and ligands. Akaike\u2019s information criteria selected the optimal score. Results were correlated with age, sex, stage, histology, performance status, and overall survival. RESULTS: Patients were randomly split 1:1 to create test and validation cohorts. In multivariate analyses, the only individual prognostic marker was EPI (hazard ratio [HR] 0.38 [0.20-0.72], P = .003). The optimal score in the test cohort was validated as a marker of inferior survival in the validation cohort and by bootstrapping. Multivariate analysis confirmed the combined score as a prognostic marker of inferior survival (HR 3.75 [2.17-6.47], P < .00001). CONCLUSION: Our study has developed a model that takes the complexity of the EGF system into account and shows that this model is a strong prognostic marker in NSCLC patients.",

Our goal was to determine how similar the xenografts are compared with their original cell line and to determine whether it is possible to predict the stability of a xenograft model beforehand. We studied a selection of 89 protein markers of interest in 14 human cell cultures and respective subcutaneous xenografts using the reverse-phase protein array technology. We specifically focused on proteins and posttranslational modifications involved in DNA repair, PI3K pathway, apoptosis, tyrosine kinase signaling, stress, cell cycle, MAPK/ERK signaling, SAPK/JNK signaling, NF\u03baB signaling, and adhesion/cytoskeleton. Using hierarchical clustering, most cell culture-xenograft pairs cluster together, suggesting a global conservation of protein signature. Particularly, Akt, NFkB, EGFR, and Vimentin showed very stable protein expression and phosphorylation levels highlighting that 4 of 10 pathways were highly correlated whatever the model. Other proteins were heterogeneously conserved depending on the cell line. Finally, cell line models with low Akt pathway activation and low levels of Vimentin gave rise to more reliable xenograft models. These results may be useful for the extrapolation of cell culture experiments to in vivo models in novel targeted drug discovery.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Certain biomarkers such as the C-reactive protein, serum albumin, and the neutrophils to lymphocyte ratio are of prognostic significance regarding survival in different types of cancers. Data from sarcoma patients are sparse and mainly derived from soft tissue sarcoma and/or metastatic cases. Adjusting for confounders such as comorbidity and age is an essential safeguard against erroneous conclusions regarding the possible prognostic value of these biomarkers. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of a battery of pretreatment biomarkers in the serum of patients with localized bone sarcomas and to adjust for potential confounders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients diagnosed with localized intermediate and high-grade bone sarcoma during 1994 to 2008 were extracted from the Aarhus Sarcoma Registry. The serum levels of albumin, C-reactive protein, hemoglobin, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and sodium were collected from the patient records. The prognostic values of overall and disease-specific mortality were tested for each individual biomarker as well as for the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) and for a new composite score incorporating five biomarkers (Aarhus composite biomarker score: ACBS). Adjustments were made for comorbidity as well as other possible prognostic factors, such as size, histological type, margin, chemotherapy, and soft tissue extension, using the Cox proportional hazard model. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients with high- or intermediate-grade localized bone sarcoma were included. Of these patients, 63 were diagnosed with chondrosarcoma and 109 patients with Ewing/osteosarcoma. The median age was 55 years for chondrosarcoma and 19 years for Ewing/osteosarcoma patients. The overall 5-year mortality was 31% [95% confidence interval (CI): 21-44] and 41% (95% CI: 33-51), whereas the 5-year disease-specific mortality was 21% (95% CI: 12-34) and 39% (95% CI: 31-49) for chondrosarcoma and Ewing/osteosarcoma, respectively. Comorbidities were present in 12% of the Ewing/osteosarcoma patients and in 24% of the chondrosarcoma patients. After adjustment for comorbidity and other confounders, it was found that elevated levels of CRP, low hemoglobin, low sodium, high GPS, and high ACBS were associated with increased overall mortality. Furthermore, elevated levels of CRP, low hemoglobin, high GPS, and high ACBS were associated with increased disease-specific mortality. CONCLUSION: Elevated levels of CRP, low hemoglobin, high GPS, and high ACBS were all independent prognostic factors for both overall and disease-specific mortality. ACBS is a new three-level score of five biomarkers, but its value has to be confirmed in an independent data set.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: It deserves investigation whether induction chemotherapy (IC) followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is inferior to the current standard of IMRT plus concurrent chemotherapy (CC) in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. METHODS: Patients who received IC (94 patients) or CC (302 patients) plus IMRT at our center between March 2003 and November 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Propensity-score matching method was used to match patients in both arms at equal ratio. Failure-free survival (FFS), overall survival (OS), distant metastasis\u2013free survival (DMFS), and locoregional relapse\u2013free survival (LRFS) were assessed with Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox regression. RESULTS: In the original cohort of 396 patients, IC plus IMRT resulted in similar FFS (P = .565), OS (P = .334), DMFS (P = .854), and LRFS (P = .999) to IMRT plus CC. In the propensity-matched cohort of 188 patients, no significant survival differences were observed between the two treatment approaches (3-year FFS 80.3% vs 81.0%, P = .590; OS 93.4% vs 92.1%, P = .808; DMFS 85.9% vs 87.7%, P = .275; and LRFS 93.1% vs 92.0%, P = .763). Adjusting for the known prognostic factors in multivariate analysis, IC plus IMRT did not cause higher risk of treatment failure, death, distant metastasis, or locoregional relapse. CONCLUSIONS: IC plus IMRT appeared to achieve comparable survival to IMRT plus CC in locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Further investigations were warranted.",

The state of OS in the proximal stomach of patients with BE and EAC is unknown. Isoprostanes are a specific marker of OS not previously used to determine OS from BE/EAC tissue samples. PATIENTS AND METHODS: OS was measured in 42 patients with BE (n = 9), EAC (n = 9), or both (n = 24) and 15 control patients. A STAT-8-Isoprostane EIA Kit served to identify 8-Isoprostanes (8-IP), and a Glutathione Assay Kit was used to measure glutathione reduced form (GSH) and glutathione oxidized form. An OxiSelect Oxidative DNA Damage ELISA Kit (8-OHdG) served to measure 8-OH-deoxyguanosine. RESULTS: The 8-IP (P = .039) and 8-OHdG (P = .008) levels were higher, and the GSH level lower (P = .031), in the proximal stomach of the study group than in that of the controls. Helicobacter pylori infection was present in 8% of the study patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the proximal stomach of BE and EAC patients, OS was elevated and antioxidative capacity was reduced. This finding suggests that the gastroesophageal reflux causing BE also induces oxidative stress in the proximal stomach and may contribute to the development of cancer in the proximal stomach and gastric cardia.",

Hierarchical cluster analysis of the measured telomere parameters identified three subgroups from our patient cohort.

Subgroups with higher levels of telomere dysfunction were comprised of tumors with greater numbers of telomeres, telomeric aggregates, and short telomeres (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). Tumors with greater telomere dysfunction were associated with unfavorable tumor characteristics (greater age at diagnosis, unfavorable histology, higher stage of disease, MYCN amplification, and higher MYCN expression) and poor prognostic risk (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Subgroups with greater telomere dysfunction also had higher intratumor heterogeneity. MYCN overexpression in two neuroblastoma cell lines with constitutively low MYCN expression induced changes in their telomere profile that were consistent with increased telomere dysfunction; this illustrates a functional relationship between MYCN and 3D telomere organization. This study demonstrates the ability to classify neuroblastomas based on the level of telomere dysfunction, which is a novel approach for this cancer.",

IDH1 mutant cases had significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) as compared to IDH1 wild-type cases. Combinatorial assessment of MGMT and TERT emerged as independent prognostic markers, especially in the IDH1 wild-type GBMs. Thus, within the IDH1 wild-type group, cases with only MGMT methylation (group 1) had the best outcome (median PFS: 83.3 weeks; OS: not reached), whereas GBMs with only TERT mutation (group 3) had the worst outcome (PFS: 19.7 weeks; OS: 32.8 weeks). Cases with both or none of these alterations (group 2) had intermediate prognosis (PFS: 47.6 weeks; OS: 89.2 weeks). Majority of the IDH1 mutant GBMs belonged to group 1 (75%), whereas only 18.7% and 6.2% showed group 2 and 3 signatures, respectively. Interestingly, none of the other genetic alterations were significantly associated with survival in IDH1 mutant or wild-type GBMs.Based on above findings, we recommend assessment of three markers, viz., IDH1, MGMT, and TERT, for GBM prognostication in routine practice. We show for the first time that IDH1 wild-type GBMs which constitute majority of the GBMs can be effectively stratified into three distinct prognostic subgroups based on MGMT and TERT status, irrespective of other genetic alterations.",

The presence of microvascular invasion (MVI) is regarded as the most important risk factor that contributes to the postoperative recurrence. Our previous study has hinted that serum microRNA-125b (miR-125b) was associated with MVI. The aim of the present study was to identify whether serum miR-125b can serve as a biomarker to reliably predict microvascular invasion (MVI) preoperatively. MiR-125b was quantified in 108 HCC patients\u2019 serum before they received surgery by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Our results revealed that MVI was associated with relapse free survival (RFS) of postoperative HCC patients; surgical margin width was associated with postoperative RFS in MVI present patients, but not in the patients without MVI. Multivariate analysis revealed that miR-125b, tumor size and AFP were the independent predictive factors associated with MVI in this cohort (P = .001, .001, .003, respectively). The probability of the predictive accuracy of miR-125b was 76.95% (51.32% specificity and 87.50% sensitivity), which was almost equal to the classifier established by combination of AFP and tumor size (78.82% probability, 65.63% specificity and 84.21% sensitivity). Furthermore, the combination of tumor size, AFP and miR-125b yielded a ROC curve area of 86.68% (72.37% specificity and 84.38% sensitivity). Our study indicated that serum miR-125b can be used to predict MVI of HCC patients before they received hepatic resection. Therefore, miR-125b can potentially guide individualized treatment, which helps HCC patients, with or without MVI, to benefit from different surgical approach.",

Patient-derived tumor cell (PDC) models with genome analysis can be a valuable platform to develop a method to overcome the clinical barrier on BTCs. Material and Methods: Between January 2012 and June 2015, 40 BTC patients\u2019 samples were collected. PDCs were isolated and cultured from surgical specimens, biopsy tissues, or malignant effusions including ascites and pleural fluid. Genome analysis using targeted panel sequencing as well as digital multiplexed gene analysis was applied to PDCs as well as primary tumors. Results: Extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (N\u00a0=\u00a015, 37.5%), intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (N\u00a0=\u00a010, 25.0%), gallbladder cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a014, 35.0%), and ampulla of Vater cancer (N\u00a0=\u00a01, 2.5%) were included. We identified 15 mutations with diverse genetic alterations in 19 cases of BTC from primary tumor specimens. The most common molecular alterations were in TP53 (8/19, 42.1%), including missense mutations such as C242Y, E285K, G112S, P19T, R148T, R248Q, and R273L. We also detected two NRAS mutations (G12C and Q61L), two KRAS mutations (G12A and G12S), two ERBB2 mutations (V777L and pM774delinsMA) and amplification, and three PIK3CA mutations (N345K, E545K, and E521K). PDC models were successfully established in 27 of 40 samples (67.5%), including 22/24 from body fluids (91.7%) and 5/16 from tissue specimens (31.3%). Conclusions: PDC models are promising tools for uncovering driver mutations and identifying rational therapeutic strategies in BTC. Application of this model is expected to inform clinical trials of drugs for molecular-based targeted therapy.",

The aim of this study was to correlate the presence of CTCs in peripheral blood with the expression of proteins in tumor tissue that have a putative role in regulation of cell growth and metastatic potential. This prospective study included 203 primary breast cancer patients treated by definitive surgery. CTCs were detected by quantitative real-time PCR for the expression of epithelial (CK19) or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition\u2013inducing transcription factor genes (TWIST1, SNAIL1, SLUG, and ZEB1). Expression of APC, ADAM23, CXCL12, E-cadherin, RASSF1, SYK, TIMP3, BRMS1, and SOCS1 proteins in primary breast tumor tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. CTCs with epithelial markers were found in 17 (9.2%) patients. Their occurrence was associated with inhibition of SOCS1 expression (odds ratio [OR] = 0.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.13; P < .001). CTCs with positive epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers were detected in 30 (15.8%) patients; however, no association with analyzed protein expressions was found. Overall, CTCs were detected in 44 (22.9%) patients. Presence of any CTC marker was significantly associated with positive CXCL12 expression (OR = 3.08; 95% CI, 1.15-8.26; P = .025) and lack of SOCS1 expression (OR = 0.10; 95% CI, 0.04-0.25; P < .001) in patient\u2019s tumor tissues. As both CXCL12 and SOCS1 proteins are involved in cytokine signaling, our results provide support for the hypothesis that aberrant signaling cross talk between cytokine and chemokine responses could have an important role in hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells in breast cancer.",

Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that PHGDH protein expression (HR = 2.285, 95% CI = 1.18 to 4.41, P = .014), tumor differentiation (HR = .307, 95% CI = .154 to 0.609, P = .001), and TNM stage (HR = 1.791, 95% CI = 1.125 to 2.85, P = .014) were independent prognostic factors in CRC. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log rank test showed that high PHGDH protein expression contributed to poor outcome in CRC patients (P < .001). In conclusion, these results suggest that assessment of PHGDH expression could be useful in identifying a high-risk subgroup of CRC.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although pazopanib treatment has become the standard chemotherapy in salvage setting for metastatic sarcoma patients, most patients progress after pazopanib treatment in 4 to 6 months. After failure to pazopanib, patients have limited options for treatment. Therefore, subsequent therapy in patients who failed to pazopanib is urgently needed and the use of patient derived cells or patient derived tumors for accompanying testing with various pharmacological inhibitors could offer additional treatment options for these patients. METHODS: Patient derived tumor cells were collected from ascites at the time of progression to pazopanib and a 13-drug panel was tested for drug sensitivity. We confirmed the results using in vitro cell viability assay and immunoblot assay. We also performed the genomic profiling of PDX model. RESULTS: The growth of patient derived tumor cells was significantly reduced by exposure to 1.0 \u03bcM AZD2014 compared with control (control versus AZD2014, mean growth = 100.0% vs 16.04%, difference = 83.96%, 95% CI = 70.01% to 97.92%, P = .0435). Similarly, 1.0 \u03bcM BEZ235 profoundly inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro when compared to control (control versus BEZ235, mean growth = 100.0% vs 7.308%, difference = 92.69%, 95% CI = 78.87% to 106.5%, P < .0001). Despite the presence of CDK4 amplification in the patient-derived tumor cells, LEE011 did not considerably inhibit cell proliferation when compared with control (control vs LEE011, mean growth = 100.0% vs 80.23%, difference = 19.77%, 95% CI = 1.828% to 37.72%, P = .0377). The immunoblot analysis showed that BEZ235 treatment decreased pAKT, pmTOR and pERK whereas AZD2014 decreased only pmTOR. CONCLUSION: Taken together, upregulation of mTOR/AKT pathway in sarcoma patient derived cells was considerably inhibited by the treatment of AZD2014 and BEZ235 with downregulation of AKT pathway (greater extent for BEZ235). These molecules may be considered as treatment option in STS patient who have failed to pazopanib in the context of clinical trials.",

METHODS: GGT activities and mRNA expression levels of GGT1 (one of the GGT subtypes) in five human lung cancer cell lines were examined by fluorescence imaging and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. In vivo imaging of an orthotopic A549 xenograft model in nude mice was performed to confirm its applicability to intraoperative imaging. Furthermore, ex vivo imaging of 73 specimens from lung cancer patients were performed and analyzed to calculate the sensitivity/specificity of gGlu-HMRG for lung cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: GGT activities and mRNA expression levels of GGT1 are diverse depending on cell type; A549, H441, and H460 showed relatively high GGT activities and expression levels, whereas H82 and H226 showed lower values. In the in vivo mouse model study, tiny pleural dissemination and hilar/mediastinal lymph node metastasis (less than 1 mm in diameter) were clearly detected 15 minutes after topical application of gGlu-HMRG. In the ex vivo study of specimens from patients, the sensitivity and specificity of gGlu-HMRG were calculated to be 43.8% (32/73) and 84.9% (62/73), respectively. When limited to female patients, never smokers, and adenocarcinomas, these values were 78.9% (15/19) and 73.7% (14/19), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although GGT activity of lung cancer cells vary, gGlu-HMRG can serve as an intraoperative imaging tool to detect small foci of lung cancer when such cells have sufficient GGT activity.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: A majority of patients with melanoma brain metastases develop multiple lesions, and these patients show particularly poor prognosis. To develop improved treatment strategies, detailed insights into the biology of melanoma brain metastases, and particularly the development of multiple lesions, are needed. The purpose of this preclinical investigation was to study melanoma cell migration within the brain after cell injection into a well-defined intracerebral site. METHODS: A-07, D-12, R-18, and U-25 human melanoma cells transfected with green fluorescent protein were injected stereotactically into the right cerebral hemisphere of nude mice. Moribund mice were killed and autopsied, and the brain was evaluated by fluorescence imaging or histological examination. RESULTS: Intracerebral inoculation of melanoma cells produced multiple lesions involving all regions of the brain, suggesting that the cells were able to migrate over substantial distances within the brain. Multiple modes of transport were identified, and all transport modes were observed in all four melanoma lines. Thus, the melanoma cells were passively transported via the flow of cerebrospinal fluid in the meninges and ventricles, they migrated actively along leptomeningeal and brain parenchymal blood vessels, and they migrated actively along the surfaces separating different brain compartments. CONCLUSION: Migration of melanoma cells after initial arrest, extravasation, and growth at a single location within the brain may contribute significantly to the development of multiple melanoma brain metastases.",

     "publication date": "06-2016",
     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The incidence of brain metastasis due to breast cancer is increasing, and prognosis is poor. Treatment is challenging because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits efficacy of systemic therapies. In this work, we develop a clinically relevant whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) plan to investigate the impact of radiation on brain metastasis development and BBB permeability in a murine model. We hypothesize that radiotherapy will decrease tumor burden and increase tumor permeability, which could offer a mechanism to increase drug uptake in brain metastases. METHODS: Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and high-resolution anatomical MRI were used to evaluate BBB integrity associated with brain metastases due to breast cancer in the MDA-MB-231-BR-HER2 model during their natural development. Novel image-guided microirradiation technology was employed to develop WBRT treatment plans and to investigate if this altered brain metastatic growth or permeability. Histology and immunohistochemistry were performed on whole brain slices corresponding with MRI to validate and further investigate radiological findings. RESULTS: Herein, we show successful implementation of microirradiation technology that can deliver WBRT to small animals. We further report that WBRT following diagnosis of brain metastasis can mitigate, but not eliminate, tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231-BR-HER2 model. Moreover, radiotherapy did not impact BBB permeability associated with metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant WBRT is not curative when delivered after MRI-detectable tumors have developed in this model. A dose of 20 Gy in 2 fractions was not sufficient to increase tumor permeability such that it could be used as a method to increase systemic drug uptake in brain metastasis.",

An emerging concept is that therapeutic outcomes are dictated by the differential redox buffering reserve in subpopulations of malignant cells, indicating the need for noninvasive biomarkers of tumor redox that can be used for dose identification and response assessment in a longitudinal setting. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhanced with the thiol-binding contrast agent Gd-LC6-SH, and hemodynamic response imaging (HRI) in combination with hypercapnia and hyperoxia were investigated as biomarkers of the pharmacodynamics of the small molecule pro-oxidant imexon (IMX). Human multiple myeloma cell lines 8226/S and an IMX-resistant variant, 8226/IM10, were established as contralateral tumors in SCID mice. T1slope, an MRI measure of the washout rate of Gd-LC6-SH, was significantly lower post-IMX therapy in 8226/S tumors compared with vehicle controls, indicating treatment-related oxidization of the tumor microenvironment, which was confirmed by analysis of tumor tissue for thiols. T1slope and ex vivo assays for thiols both indicated a more reduced microenvironment in 8226/IM10 tumors following IMX therapy. HRI with hypercapnia challenge revealed IMX inhibition of vascular dilation in 8226/S tumors but not 8226/IM10 tumors, consistent with decreased immunohistochemical staining for smooth muscle actin in treated 8226/S tumors.

In this study, we investigated if miR-1207-3p is capable of distinguishing between indolent and aggressive PCa and if it contributes to explaining the disproportionate aggressiveness of PCa in men of African ancestry (moAA). A total of 404 patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the prostate were recruited between 1988 and 2003 at the Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA. Patient clinicopathological features and demographic characteristics such as race were identified. RNA samples from 404 postprostatectomy prostate tumor tissue samples were analyzed by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction for the mRNA expression of miR-1207-3p. miR-1207-3p expression in PCa that resulted in overall death or PCa-specific death is significantly higher than in PCa cases that did not. The same positive correlation holds true for other clinical characteristics such as biochemical recurrence, Gleason score, clinical stage, and prostate-specific antigen level. Furthermore, miR-1207-3p expression was significantly less in moAA in comparison to Caucasian men. We also evaluated whether miR-1207-3p is associated with clinical outcomes adjusted for age at diagnosis and tumor stage in the modeling. Using competing risk regression, the PCa patients with a high miR-1207-3p expression (\u2265\u00a06 vs 3) had a high risk to develop PCa recurrence (hazard rate = 2.5, P < .001) adjusting for age at diagnosis and tumor stage.

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer (PC) surveillance is currently offered to individuals with a genetic predisposition to PC, but routinely used radiological screening modalities are not entirely reliable in detecting early-stage PC or its precursor lesions. We recently identified a discriminating PC biomarker signature in a sporadic patient cohort. In this study, we investigated if protein profiling can accurately distinguish PC from non-PC in a pancreatic surveillance cohort of genetically predisposed individuals. METHODS: Serum samples of 66 individuals with a CDKN2A germline mutation who participated in the pancreatic surveillance program (5 cases, 61 controls) were obtained following a standardized protocol. After sample clean-up, peptide and protein profiles were obtained on an ultrahigh-resolution matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization\u2013Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry platform. A discriminant score for each sample was calculated with a previously designed prediction rule, and the median discriminant scores of cases and controls were compared. Individuals with precursor lesions of PC (n = 4) and individuals with a recent diagnosis of melanoma (n = 4) were also separately considered. RESULTS: Cases had a higher median discriminant score than controls (0.26 vs 0.016; P = .001). The only individual with pathologically confirmed precursor lesions of PC could also be clearly distinguished from controls, and having a (recent) medical history of melanoma did not influence the protein signatures. CONCLUSIONS: Peptide and protein signatures are able to accurately distinguish PC cases from controls in a pancreatic surveillance setting. Mass spectrometry\u2013based protein profiling therefore seems to be a promising candidate for implementation in the pancreatic surveillance program as an additional screening modality.",

Solid-phase proximity ligation assay (SP-PLA) is an analytic method with the ability to analyze many proteins at the same time in small amounts of plasma. The aim of this study was to explore the potential use of SP-PLA for biomarker validation in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plasma samples from patients with stage I to IV CRC, with (n = 31) and without (n = 29) disease dissemination at diagnosis or later, were analyzed with SP-PLA using 35 antibodies targeting an equal number of proteins in 5-\u03bcl plasma samples. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), analyzed earlier in this cohort using a different technology, was used as a reference. RESULTS: A total of 21 of the 35 investigated proteins were detectable with SP-PLA. Patients in stage II to III with disseminated disease had lower plasma concentrations of HCC-4 (P = .025). Low plasma levels of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases\u20131 were seen in patients with disseminated disease stage II (P = .003). The level of CEA was higher in patients with disease dissemination compared with those without (P = .007).

METHODS: A total of 310 metastatic or recurrent gastric cancer patients with good performance status who received first-line chemotherapy were enrolled. Prognostic significance was determined using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Incorporating all pretreatment indicators, a prognostic model was established. Overall survival outcomes were compared with different risk groups using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis, no previous gastrectomy [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08-1.85], number of distant metastatic sites (HR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.11-1.96), bone metastasis (HR = 2.20; 95% CI = 1.16\u20134.18), liver metastasis (HR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.31-2.39), and an elevated neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (HR = 1.37; 95% CI = 1.04-1.79) were independent prognostic factors of overall survival.

TIFP values of up to 40 mm Hg have been measured in experimental solid tumors using two conventional invasive techniques: the wick-in-needle and the micropuncture technique. We propose a novel noninvasive method of determining TIFP via ultrasonic investigation with scanning acoustic microscopy at 30-MHz frequency. In our experimental setup, we observed for the impedance fluctuations in the outer tumor hull of A431-vulva carcinoma\u2013derived tumor xenograft mice. The gain dependence of signal strength was quantified, and the relaxation of tissue was calibrated with simultaneous hydrostatic pressure measurements. Signal patterns from the acoustical images were translated into TIFP curves, and a putative saturation effect was found for tumor pressures larger than 3 mm Hg. This is the first noninvasive approach to determine TIFP values in tumors. This technique can provide a potentially promising noninvasive assessment of TIFP and, therefore, can be used to determine the TIFP before treatment approach as well to measure therapeutic efficacy highlighted by lowered TFP values.",

Gene expression profiling of intact human tumors fails to reveal the molecular nature of functionally distinct epithelial cell subpopulations, in particular the tumor cells that fuel tumor growth, metastasis, and disease relapse. We generated primary serum-free cultures of NSCLC and then exposed them to conditions known to promote differentiation: the air-liquid interface (ALI) and serum. The transcriptional network of the primary cultures was associated with stem cells, indicating a poorly differentiated state, and worse overall survival of NSCLC patients. Strikingly, the overexpression of RNA splicing and processing factors was a prominent feature of the poorly differentiated cells and was also observed in clinical datasets. A genome-wide analysis of splice isoform expression revealed many alternative splicing events that were specific to the differentiation state of the cells, including an unexpectedly high frequency of events on chromosome 19. The poorly differentiated cells exhibited alternative splicing in many genes associated with tumor progression, as exemplified by the preferential expression of the short isoform of telomeric repeat-binding factor 1 (TERF1), also known as Pin2. Our findings demonstrate the utility of the ALI method for probing the molecular mechanisms that underlie NSCLC pathogenesis and provide novel insight into posttranscriptional mechanisms in poorly differentiated lung cancer cells.",

Furthermore, they have been implicated in the process of drug resistance, especially endocrinal therapies. In this study, we aimed to define the correlation between the PI3K mutations and the expression of the phosphorylated forms of different downstream molecules in women with estrogen receptor (ER)\u2013positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2\u2013negative (luminal) early breast cancer treated at Cairo university hospitals. METHODS: Next-generation sequencing was used to detect mutations in the PIK3CA hotspots (in exons 9 and 20). Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarray blocks prepared from samples of 35 Egyptian luminal breast cancer patients in the pathology department of Centre L\u00e9on B\u00e9rard (CLB). The intensity and the percentage of stained tumor cells were integrated to define high versus low biomarker expression. The cytoplasmic and nuclear stainings were graded separately. Patients were followed for a median of 4.7 years (2.1 to 6.9 years). Correlation was done between PI3K mutations and the immunohistochemistry expression of pAKT, LKB1, p4EBP1, and pS6 ribosomal protein (pS6RP) with the clinicopathologic features and disease free survival (DFS) of the patients. RESULTS: Median age at diagnosis was 51.3 years (range, 25 to 82 years). Tumors were larger than 20 mm in 79.2% of the cases, whereas 57.9% had axillary lymph node deposits. Only 12.3% of the patients had SBR grade I tumors, 50.8% had grade II, and 36.8% had grade III. ERs were negative in 6 patients (17%) after pathology review. Thirty-two cases were assessable for LKB1 and pAKT, 33 for p4EBP1 and pS6RP, and 24 for PI3K mutations. Nuclear LKB1, cytoplasmic LKB1, nuclear pAKT, cytoplasmic pAKT, nuclear p4EBP1, and cytoplasmic pS6RP expression was high in 65.6%, 62.5%, 62.5%, 68.8%, 42.4%, and 57.6%, respectively. PIK3CA mutations were found in 7 patients (29.2%). PI3K mutations were correlated with nuclear localization of pAKT (i.e., decreased cytoplasmic pAKT, P = .04; and increased nuclear pAKT, P = .10). There was a tendency toward an inverse correlation between PI3K mutations and the expression of pS6RP (P = .10) and p4EBP1 (P = .19). Nuclear LKB1 expression was a marker of good prognosis. It was associated with smaller tumors (P = .05), more ER (P = .08) and progesteron receptor (PgR) positivity (P = .002). In the Kaplan Meier (KM) model, patients with high nuclear LKB1 had longer DFS (hazard ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-1.10; P = .08). Nuclear pAKT high expression also carried a tendency toward longer DFS (hazard ratio = 0.51; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-1.16; P = .13). The expression of p4EBP1, pS6RP, and the PI3K mutational status did not show any prognostic significance in our cohort. CONCLUSION: Among the studied biomarkers, only nuclear expression of LKB1 and pAKT tended to predict better survival in breast cancer patients. PI3K mutation was correlated with the expression of nuclear pAKT but not pS6RP or p4EBP1.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the best standard treatment, optimal cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy, prognosis of advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) remains poor. Recently, CRS plus hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) has been developed to treat peritoneal carcinomatosis (PC). This study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CRS+HIPEC to treat PC from advanced/recurrent EOC. METHODS: Forty-six PC patients from advanced EOC (group A) or recurrent EOC (group B) were treated by 50 CRS+HIPEC procedures. The primary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS); the secondary endpoints were safety profiles. RESULTS: The median OS was 74.0 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.5-139.5] for group A versus 57.5 months (95% CI 29.8-85.2) for group B (P = .68). The median PFS was not reached for group A versus 8.5 months (95% CI 0-17.5) for group B (P = .034). Better median OS correlated with peritoneal cancer index (PCI) < 20 (76.6 months for PCI \u2264 20 group vs 38.5 months for PCI > 20 group, P = .01), complete cyroreduction (residual disease \u2264 2.5 mm) [79.5 months for completeness of cytoreduction (CC) score 0-1 vs 24.3 months for CC 2-3, P = .00], and sensitivity to platinum (65.3 months for platinum-sensitive group vs 20.0 for platinum-resistant group, P = .05). Serious adverse events occurred in five patients (10.0%). Multivariate analysis identified CC score as the only independent factor for better survival. CONCLUSION: For advanced/recurrent EOC, CRS+HIPEC could improve OS with acceptable safety.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma can arise from the primary tumor (\u201cearly recurrence\u201d) or de novo from tumor formation in a cirrhotic environment (\u201clate recurrence\u201d). We aimed to develop one simple gene expression score applicable in both the tumor and the surrounding liver that can predict the recurrence risk. METHODS: We determined differentially expressed genes in a cell model of cancer aggressiveness. These genes were first validated in three large published data sets of hepatocellular carcinoma from which we developed a seven-gene risk score. RESULTS: The gene score was applied on two independent large patient cohorts. In the first cohort, with only tumor data available, it could predict the recurrence risk at 3 years after resection (68 \u00b1 10% vs 35 \u00b1 7%, P = .03). In the second cohort, when applied on the tumor, this gene score predicted early recurrence (62 \u00b1 5% vs 37 \u00b1 4%, P < .001), and when applied on the surrounding liver tissue, the same genes also correlated with late recurrence. Four patient classes with each different time patterns and rates of recurrence could be identified based on combining tumor and liver scores. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis, our gene score remained significantly associated with recurrence, independent from other important cofactors such as disease stage (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: We developed a Global Risk Score that is able to simultaneously predict the risk of early recurrence when applied on the tumor itself, as well as the risk of late recurrence when applied on the surrounding liver tissue.",

     "abstract": "Human brain tumors such as glioblastomas are typically detected using conventional, nonquantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, such as T2-weighted and contrast enhanced T1-weighted MRI. In this manuscript, we tested whether dynamic quantitative T1 mapping by MRI can localize orthotopic glioma tumors in an objective manner. Quantitative T1 mapping was performed by MRI over multiple time points using the conventional contrast agent Optimark. We compared signal differences to determine the gadolinium concentration in tissues over time. The T1 parametric maps made it easy to identify the regions of contrast enhancement and thus tumor location. Doubling the typical human dose of contrast agent resulted in a clearer demarcation of these tumors. Therefore, T1 mapping of brain tumors is gadolinium dose dependent and improves detection of tumors by MRI. The use of T1 maps provides a quantitative means to evaluate tumor detection by gadolinium-based contrast agents over time. This dynamic quantitative T1 mapping technique will also enable future quantitative evaluation of various targeted MRI contrast agents.",

     "abstract": "Studying early response to cancer treatment is significant for patient treatment stratification and follow-up. Although recent advances in positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allow for evaluation of tumor response, a quantitative objective assessment of treatment-related effects offers localization and quantification of structural and functional changes in the tumor region. Radiomics, the process of computerized extraction of features from radiographic images, is a new strategy for capturing subtle changes in the tumor region that works by quantifying subvisual patterns which might escape human identification. The goal of this study was to demonstrate feasibility for performing radiomics analysis on integrated PET/MRI to characterize early treatment response in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) undergoing sunitinib therapy. Two patients with advanced RCC were imaged using an integrated PET/MRI scanner. [18 F] fluorothymidine (FLT) was used as the PET radiotracer, which can measure the degree of cell proliferation. Image acquisitions included test/retest scans before sunitinib treatment and one scan 3 weeks into treatment using [18 F] FLT-PET, T2-weighted (T2w), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) protocols, where DWI yielded an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map. Our framework to quantitatively characterize treatment-related changes involved the following analytic steps: 1) intraacquisition and interacquisition registration of protocols to allow voxel-wise comparison of changes in radiomic features, 2) correction and pseudoquantification of T2w images to remove acquisition artifacts and examine tissue-specific response, 3) characterization of information captured by T2w MRI, FLT-PET, and ADC via radiomics, and 4) combining multiparametric information to create a map of integrated changes from PET/MRI radiomic features. Standardized uptake value (from FLT-PET) and ADC textures ranked highest for reproducibility in a test/retest evaluation as well as for capturing treatment response, in comparison to high variability seen in T2w MRI. The highest-ranked radiomic feature yielded a normalized percentage change of 63% within the RCC region and 17% in a spatially distinct normal region relative to its pretreatment value. By comparison, both the original and postprocessed T2w signal intensity appeared to be markedly less sensitive and specific to changes within the tumor. Our preliminary results thus suggest that radiomics analysis could be a powerful tool for characterizing treatment response in integrated PET/MRI.",

Concerns regarding quality of preclinical data have been raised in recent reports. This report examines the data on the interaction of 10 drugs with radiation and provides recommendations for improving the quality, reproducibility, and utility of future studies. The drugs were AZD6244, bortezomib, 17-DMAG, erlotinib, gefitinib, lapatinib, oxaliplatin/Lipoxal, sunitinib (Pfizer, Corporate headquarters, New York, NY), thalidomide, and vorinostat. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo data were tabulated from 125 published papers, including methods, radiation and drug doses, schedules of administration, assays, measures of interaction, presentation and interpretation of data, dosimetry, and conclusions. RESULTS: In many instances, the studies contained inadequate or unclear information that would hamper efforts to replicate or intercompare the studies, and that weakened the evidence for designing and conducting clinical trials. The published reports on these drugs showed mixed results on enhancement of radiation response, except for sunitinib, which was ineffective. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for improved experimental design, execution, and reporting of preclinical testing of agents that are candidates for clinical use in combination with radiation. A checklist is provided for authors and reviewers to ensure that preclinical studies of drug-radiation combinations meet standards of design, execution, and interpretation, and report necessary information to ensure high quality and reproducibility of studies. Improved design, execution, common measures of enhancement, and consistent interpretation of preclinical studies of drug-radiation interactions will provide rational guidance for prioritizing drugs for clinical radiotherapy trials and for the design of such trials.",

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between SMAD4 expression and the outcome of pancreatic cancer patients by performing a meta-analysis. METHODS: We systematically searched for relevant studies evaluating the relationship between SMAD4 expression and the outcome of pancreatic cancer patients until May 2015. A meta-analysis was performed using STATA 12.0, and pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of the association between SMAD4 expression and the prognosis of pancreatic cancer patients. RESULTS: The analysis included 1762 patients from 14 studies, with 1401 patients from 11 studies and 927 patients from 8 studies included in the univariate and multivariate analyses, respectively. Loss of SMAD4 expression was found to be significantly correlated with poor overall survival, with the combined HR (95% CI) of 1.20 (1.03-1.40). After adjusting for potential confounders using the Cox regression model, the pooled HR (95% CI) was 1.88 (1.31-2.70). In subgroup analysis, study region, number of patients, follow-up duration, and cutoff value were found to affect the significance of the association between loss of SMAD4 expression and poor prognosis. In addition, there was no evidence of publication bias, as suggested by Begg\u2019s and Egger\u2019s test.

     "abstract": "The purpose is to compare quantitative dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metrics with imaging tumor size for early prediction of breast cancer response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and evaluation of residual cancer burden (RCB). Twenty-eight patients with 29 primary breast tumors underwent DCE-MRI exams before, after one cycle of, at midpoint of, and after NACT. MRI tumor size in the longest diameter (LD) was measured according to the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) guidelines. Pharmacokinetic analyses of DCE-MRI data were performed with the standard Tofts and Shutter-Speed models (TM and SSM). After one NACT cycle the percent changes of DCE-MRI parameters Ktrans (contrast agent plasma/interstitium transfer rate constant), ve (extravascular and extracellular volume fraction), kep (intravasation rate constant), and SSM-unique \u03c4i (mean intracellular water lifetime) are good to excellent early predictors of pathologic complete response (pCR) vs. non-pCR, with univariate logistic regression C statistics value in the range of 0.804 to 0.967. ve values after one cycle and at NACT midpoint are also good predictors of response, with C ranging 0.845 to 0.897. However, RECIST LD changes are poor predictors with C = 0.609 and 0.673, respectively. Post-NACT Ktrans, \u03c4i, and RECIST LD show statistically significant (P < .05) correlations with RCB. The performances of TM and SSM analyses for early prediction of response and RCB evaluation are comparable. In conclusion, quantitative DCE-MRI parameters are superior to imaging tumor size for early prediction of therapy response. Both TM and SSM analyses are effective for therapy response evaluation. However, the \u03c4i parameter derived only with SSM analysis allows the unique opportunity to potentially quantify therapy-induced changes in tumor energetic metabolism.",

The outcome measures were overall survival, treatment response, and adverse events. Only four randomized controlled trials met our inclusion criteria. Three of these evaluated responses to nivolumab, whereas one tested pembrolizumab. The result of our analysis suggested that nivolumab may improve the overall response rate in treating melanoma relative to chemotherapy and has few associated adverse events. Similarly, in metastatic melanoma patients, nivolumab had a significant advantage over dacarbazine in terms of 1-year survival, progression-free survival, and objective response rate. Regarding dose levels of nivolumab for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, the outcomes in response to 2 and 10 mg/kg were similar, but both had significant advantages over 0.3 mg/kg. In addition, pembrolizumab showed similar outcomes in response to 2- and 10-mg/kg treatment.

Prostate orthotopic mouse model has been widely used to study human CaP in preclinical settings. Measurement of changes in tumor size obtained from noninvasive diagnostic images is a standard method for monitoring responses to anticancer modalities. This article reports for the first time the usage of a three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound system equipped with photoacoustic (PA) imaging in monitoring longitudinal prostate tumor growth in a PC-3 orthotopic NODSCID mouse model (n = 8). Two-dimensional and 3D modes of ultrasound show great ability in accurately depicting the size and shape of prostate tumors. PA function on two-dimensional and 3D images showed average oxygen saturation and average hemoglobin concentration of the tumor. Results showed a good fit in representative exponential tumor growth curves (n = 3; r2 = 0.948, 0.955, and 0.953, respectively) and a good correlation of tumor volume measurements performed in vivo with autopsy (n = 8, r = 0.95, P < .001). The application of 3D ultrasound imaging proved to be a useful imaging modality in monitoring tumor growth in an orthotopic mouse model, with advantages such as high contrast, uncomplicated protocols, economical equipment, and nonharmfulness to animals. PA mode also enabled display of blood oxygenation surrounding the tumor and tumor vasculature and angiogenesis, making 3D ultrasound imaging an ideal tool for preclinical cancer research.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between PD-L1 expression and overall survival (OS) among 204 patients with advanced NSCLC treated at Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark, from 2007 to 2012. PD-L1 expression was measured using a prototype immunohistochemistry assay with the anti\u2013PD-L1 22C3 antibody (Merck). PD-L1 strong positivity and weak positivity were defined to be traceable to the clinical trial version of the assay. RESULTS: Twenty-five percent of patients had PD-L1 strong-positive tumors, and 50% had PD-L1 weak-positive tumors. No statistically significant association was found between PD-L1 expression and survival; adjusted hazard ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.03; median OS, 9.0 months) for the PD-L1 strong-positive group and 1.07 (0.74-1.55; median OS, 9.8 months) for the PD-L1 weak-positive group compared with the PD-L1\u2013negative group (median OS, 7.5 months).

Results: Droxinostat inhibited proliferation and colony formation of the HCC cell lines examined. Hepatoma cell death was induced through activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and downregulation of FLIP expression. Droxinostat suppressed histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 expression and promoted acetylation of histones H3 and H4. Knockdown of HDAC3 induced hepatoma cell apoptosis and histone H3 and H4 acetylation.

CAC Matrigel invasion assays and tumorigenicity assays in nude mice were performed to examine the effect of NCFs on CAC invasive behaviour and tumorigenicity in 3D spheroids. We investigated the expression pattern of fibroblast activation protein-\u03b1 (FAP-\u03b1) by immunohistochemical staining. CAC monocultures did not form densely-packed 3D spheroids, whereas cocultured CACs and NCFs formed 3D spheroids.

     "abstract": "Mammographic density has been proven as an independent risk factor for breast cancer. Women with dense breast tissue visible on a mammogram have a much higher cancer risk than women with little density. A great research effort has been devoted to incorporate breast density into risk prediction models to better estimate each individual\u2019s cancer risk. In recent years, the passage of breast density notification legislation in many states in USA requires that every mammography report should provide information regarding the patient\u2019s breast density. Accurate definition and measurement of breast density are thus important, which may allow all the potential clinical applications of breast density to be implemented. Because the two-dimensional mammography-based measurement is subject to tissue overlapping and thus not able to provide volumetric information, there is an urgent need to develop reliable quantitative measurements of breast density. Various new imaging technologies are being developed. Among these new modalities, volumetric mammographic density methods and three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging are the most well studied. Besides, emerging modalities, including different x-ray\u2013based, optical imaging, and ultrasound-based methods, have also been investigated. All these modalities may either overcome some fundamental problems related to mammographic density or provide additional density and/or compositional information.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regions of interest corresponding to the contrast-enhancing and hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images were generated. Diffusion-weighted images were processed to provide maps of apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and longitudinal and radial eigenvalues. Histograms of diffusion values were generated and summary statistics calculated. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to assess the association of representative imaging parameters with survival with adjustments for age, Karnofsky performance status, and extent of resection. RESULTS: Although progression-free survival was significantly longer for the TMZ+erl+bev cohort (12.8 vs 7.3 months), there was no significant difference in overall survival between the two populations (17.0 vs 17.8 months). The median contrast-enhancing lesion volumes decreased from 6.3 to 1.9 cm3 from baseline to the postradiotherapy scan for patients in the TMZ+enza cohort and from 2.8 to 0.9cm3 for the TMZ+erl+bev cohort. Changes in the T2 lesion volumes were only significant for the latter cohort (26.5 to 11.9 cm3). The median apparent diffusion coefficient and related diffusion parameters were significantly increased for the TMZ+enza cohort (1054 to 1225 \u03bcm2/s). More of the anatomic parameters were associated with survival for the TMZ+enza cohort, whereas more diffusion parameters were associated with survival for the TMZ+erl+bev cohort. CONCLUSION: The early changes in anatomic and diffusion imaging parameters and their association with survival reflected differences in the mechanisms of action of the treatments that were being given. This suggests that integrating diffusion metrics and anatomic lesion volumes into the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology criteria would assist in interpreting treatment-induced changes and predicting outcome in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who are receiving such combination treatments.",

METHODS: Fifty-one NPC patients treated with IMRT from 2004 to 2009 were analyzed. All patients received neoadjuvant, concurrent, or adjuvant use of cisplatin. Pure tone audiometry was performed during the follow-up period with a median time of 60\u00a0months, ranging from 28 to 84\u00a0months. Correlation of SNHL at low frequencies (pure tone average, 0.5-2\u00a0kHz) with a series of factors was analyzed. RESULTS: Among 102 ears, 12.7% had low-frequency SNHL and 42.2% had high-frequency (4\u00a0kHz) SNHL. The incidence of low-frequency SNHL was greater in patients with age\u00a0>\u00a040, with T-stage 4, or who received cumulative cisplatin dose (CCD)\u00a0>\u00a0200\u00a0mg/m2 (P\u00a0=\u00a0.034, .011, and .003, respectively) and in ears with secretory otitis media (SOM) (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002). Several dosimetric parameters were found to be correlated with SNHL. Univariate analysis showed that the minimum radiation dose to 0.1\u00a0ml highest dose volume (D0.1\u00a0ml) of the cochlea was the best radiation-related predictive parameter. Multivariate analysis indicated that CCD, SOM, and D0.1\u00a0ml of cochlea (P\u00a0=\u00a0.035, .012, and .022, respectively) were the factors associated with SNHL. CONCLUSION: For NPC patients treated with IMRT and chemotherapy, the incidence of treatment-related SNHL was associated with CCD, D0.1\u00a0ml of cochlea, and SOM.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Quantitative ultrasound parameters based on form factor models were investigated as potential biomarkers of cell death in breast tumor (MDA-231) xenografts treated with chemotherapy. METHODS: Ultrasound backscatter radiofrequency data were acquired from MDA-231 breast cancer tumor\u2013bearing mice (n = 20) before and after the administration of chemotherapy drugs at two ultrasound frequencies: 7 MHz and 20 MHz. Radiofrequency spectral analysis involved estimating the backscatter coefficient from regions of interest in the center of the tumor, to which form factor models were fitted, resulting in estimates of average scatterer diameter and average acoustic concentration (AAC). RESULTS: The \u2206AAC parameter extracted from the spherical Gaussian model was found to be the most effective cell death biomarker (at the lower frequency range, r2 = 0.40). At both frequencies, AAC in the treated tumors increased significantly (P = .026 and .035 at low and high frequencies, respectively) 24 hours after treatment compared with control tumors. Furthermore, stepwise multiple linear regression analysis of the low-frequency data revealed that a multiparameter quantitative ultrasound model was strongly correlated to cell death determined histologically posttreatment (r2 = 0.74). CONCLUSION: The Gaussian form factor model\u2013based scattering parameters can potentially be used to track the extent of cell death at clinically relevant frequencies (7 MHz). The 20-MHz results agreed with previous findings in which parameters related to the backscatter intensity (i.e., AAC) increased with cell death. The findings suggested that, in addition to the backscatter coefficient parameter \u2206AAC, biological features including tumor heterogeneity and initial tumor volume were important factors in the prediction of cell death response.",

METHODS: We administered bevacizumab plus FOLFIRI with irinotecan dose escalation to treat 70 mCRC patients. The UGT1A1 *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotypes started with a 180-mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, and UGT1A1 *28/*28 genotype started with a dose of 120 mg/m2. The dose of irinotecan was escalated at increasing intervals of 20 to 30 mg/m2 until grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) occurred. The clinical response rate, toxicity, and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The clinical response and disease control rates of mCRC patients treated with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab were significantly better in patients with UGT1A1 *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotypes than in patients with UGT1A1 *28/*28 (P = .006 and P < .001, respectively). Grade 3/4 AEs were significantly more common in mCRC patients with the UGT1A1 *28/*28 genotype (P < .001). Progression-free survival was significantly higher in UGT1A1 *1/*1 and *1/*28 patients (P = .002). mCRC patients who underwent metastasectomy achieved better overall survival than those who did not undergo metastasectomy (P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that mCRC patients with UGT1A1 *1/*1 and *1/*28 genotypes could receive escalated doses of irinotecan to obtain a more favorable clinical outcome without significant AEs.",

     "abstract": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is characterized by a profound disruption of proapoptotic signaling networks leading to chemo- and radioresistance. A key mediator of DNA damage-induced apoptosis is the BH3-only protein PUMA. Given its central role in proapoptotic signaling, we analyzed a series of more than 600 precision-annotated primary RCC specimens for PUMA protein expression. We found a reduced expression of PUMA in 22.6% of RCCs analyzed. Unexpectedly, however, PUMA deficiency was not associated with more aggressive tumor characteristic as expected. Instead, a reduced PUMA expression was associated with a lower TNM stage, lower histopathologic grade, and more favorable cancer-specific patient survival. A direct correlation in a separate patient cohort revealed a profound disconnection between PUMA expression and apoptosis as exemplified by the fact that the tumor with the highest level of apoptotic cells was PUMA deficient. In a series of in vitro studies, we corroborated these results and discovered the highest propensity to undergo apoptosis in an RCC cell line with virtually undetectable PUMA expression. At the same time, PUMA expression was not necessarily associated with stronger apoptosis induction, which underscores the striking functional heterogeneity of PUMA expression and apoptosis in RCC. Collectively, our findings suggest that PUMA-independent mechanisms of cell death exist and may play an important role in suppressing malignant progression. They underscore the functional heterogeneity of RCCs and suggest that PUMA expression alone may not be a suitable predictive biomarker. A better understanding of alternative proapoptotic pathways, however, may help to design novel therapeutic strategies for patients with advanced RCC.",

     "abstract": "We have recently shown that centrosomal protein 57 (CEP57) is overexpressed in a subset of human prostate cancers. CEP57 is involved in intracellular transport processes, and its overexpression causes mitotic defects as well as abnormal microtubule nucleation and bundling. In the present study, we further characterized the prognostic and functional role of CEP57 in prostate cancer. Unexpectedly, we found that high CEP57 expression is an independent prognostic factor for a more favorable biochemical recurrence-free survival in two large patient cohorts. To reconcile this finding with the ability of CEP57 to cause cell division errors and thus potentially promote malignant progression, we hypothesized that alterations of microtubule-associated transport processes, in particular nuclear translocation of the androgen receptor (AR), may play a role in our finding. However, CEP57 overexpression and microtubule bundling had, surprisingly, no effect on the nuclear translocation of the AR. Instead, we found a significant increase of cells with disarranged microtubules and a cellular morphology suggestive of a cytokinesis defect. Because mitotic dysfunction leads to a reduced daughter cell formation, it can explain the survival benefit of patients with increased CEP57 expression. In contrast, we show that a reduced expression of CEP57 is associated with malignant growth and metastasis. Taken together, our findings underscore that high CEP57 expression is associated with mitotic impairment and less aggressive tumor behavior. Because the CEP57-induced microtubule stabilization had no detectable effect on AR nuclear translocation, our results furthermore suggest that microtubule-targeting therapeutics used in advanced prostate cancer such as docetaxel may have modes of action that are at least in part independent of AR transport inhibition.",

Higher preoperative serum LDH level was associated with worse prognosis. In a multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis, the preoperative serum LDH level could predict overall survival and recurrence independently.

The aim of the present study is to compare the safety and outcomes of endoscopic and open resection of small gastric GISTs. From May 2010 to March 2014, a total of 90 small gastric GIST patients were enrolled in the present study, including 40 patients who underwent surgical resection and 50 patients who underwent endoscopic resection. The clinicopathological characteristics, resection-related factors, and clinical outcomes were recorded and analyzed. The clinicopathological characteristics were comparable between the two groups except for tumor location and DOG-1 expression. Compared with the surgical resection group, the operation time was shorter (P = .000), blood loss was less (P = .000), pain intensity was lower (P < .05), duration of first flatus and defecation was shorter (P < .05), and medical cost of hospitalization was lower (P = .027) in the endoscopic resection group. The complications and postoperative hospital stay were comparable between the two groups. No in situ recurrence or liver metastasis was observed during follow-up. Endoscopic resection of small gastric GISTs is safe and feasible compared with surgical resection, although perforation could not be totally avoided during and after resection.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow aspirates were obtained at the time of first surgery, and ER and HER2 status on DTCs was assessed simultaneously by immunocytochemistry using a triple fluorescence staining method. RESULTS: The median number of DTCs was 13 (range 1-95). The concordance rate between ER status on DTC and PT was 74%. Patients with an ER-positive PT were significantly more likely to have at least one ER-positive DTC (34 out of 42) than patients with an ER-negative PT (6 out of 12; P = .031). Thirty-nine (93%) of the 42 patients with ER-positive PT had at least one ER-negative DTC. The concordance rate between HER2 status on DTC and PT was 52%. The probability of having at least one HER2-positive DTC was not related to the HER2 status of the PT (P = 0.56). Twenty-two (46%) of the 48 patients with a HER2-negative PT had at least one HER2-positive DTC. All the six patients with a HER2-positive PT had at least one HER2-negative DTC. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our study confirms that ER and/or HER2 status may differ between DTC and PT. This discordance could be important for patients lacking ER or HER2 expression on the PT but showing ER-positive or HER2-positive DTC because they might benefit from an endocrine and/or HER2-targeted therapy.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: To analyze diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) findings of meningiomas and to compare them with tumor grade, cell count, and proliferation index and to test a possibility of use of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) to differentiate benign from atypical/malignant tumors. METHODS: Forty-nine meningiomas were analyzed. DWI was done using a multislice single-shot echo-planar imaging sequence. A polygonal region of interest was drawn on ADC maps around the margin of the lesion. In all lesions, minimal ADC values (ADCmin) and mean ADC values (ADCmean) were estimated. Normalized ADC (NADC) was calculated in every case as a ratio ADCmean meningioma/ADCmean white matter. All meningiomas were surgically resected and analyzed histopathologically. The tumor proliferation index was estimated on Ki-67 antigen\u2013stained specimens. Cell density was calculated. Collected data were evaluated by means of descriptive statistics. Analyses of ADC/NADC values were performed by means of two-sided t tests. RESULTS: The mean ADCmean value was higher in grade I meningiomas in comparison to grade II/III tumors (0.96 vs 0.80 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a03 mm2s\u2212\u00a01, P = .006). Grade II/III meningiomas showed lower NADC values in comparison to grade I tumors (1.05 vs 1.26, P = .015). There was no significant difference in ADCmin values between grade I and II/III tumors (0.69 vs 0.63 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a03 mm2s\u2212\u00a01, P = .539). The estimated cell count varied from 486 to 2091 (mean value, 1158.20 \u00b1 333.74; median value, 1108). There were no significant differences in cell count between grade I and grade II/III tumors (1163.93 vs 1123.86 cells, P = .77). The mean level of the proliferation index was 4.78 \u00b1 5.08%, the range was 1% to 18%, and the median value was 2%. The proliferation index was statistically significant higher in grade II/III meningiomas in comparison to grade I tumors (15.43% vs 3.00%, P = .001). Ki-67 was negatively associated with ADCmean (r = \u2212\u00a00.61, P < .001) and NADC (r = \u2212\u00a00.60, P < .001). No significant correlations between cell count and ADCmean (r = \u2212\u00a00.20, P = .164) or NADC (r = \u2212\u00a00.25, P = .079) were found.ADCmin correlated statistically significant with cell count (r = \u2212\u00a00.44, P = .002) but not with Ki-67 (r = \u2212\u00a00.22, P = .129). Furthermore, the association between ADCmin and cell count was stronger in grade II/III tumors (r = \u2212\u00a00.79, P = .036) versus grade I meningiomas (r = \u2212\u00a00.41, P = .008). An ADCmean value of less than 0.85 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a03 mm2s\u2212\u00a01 was determined as the threshold in differentiating between grade I and grade II/III meningiomas (sensitivity 72.9%, specificity 73.1%, accuracy 73.0%). The positive and negative predictive values were 33.3% and 96.8%, respectively. The same threshold ADCmean value was used in differentiating between tumors with Ki-67 level \u2265\u00a05% and meningiomas with low proliferation index (Ki-67 <\u00a05%). This threshold yielded a sensitivity of 70.6%, a specificity of 81.2%, and an accuracy of 77.6%. The positive and negative predictive values were 66.6% and 83.9%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Grade II/III tumors had lower ADCmean values than grade I meningiomas. ADCmean correlated negatively with tumor proliferation index and ADCmin with tumor cell count. These associations were different in several meningiomas. ADCmean can be used for distinguishing between benign and atypical/malignant tumors.",

How various imaging protocols affect quantitative image features is currently a highly active area of research. To assess the variability of image features derived from conventional [three-dimensional (3D)] and respiratory-gated (RG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images of lung cancer patients, image features were computed from 23 lung cancer patients. Both protocols for each patient were acquired during the same imaging session. PET tumor volumes were segmented using an adaptive technique which accounted for background. CT tumor volumes were delineated with a commercial segmentation tool. Using RG PET images, the tumor center of mass motion, length, and rotation were calculated. Fifty-six image features were extracted from all images consisting of shape descriptors, first-order features, and second-order texture features. Overall, 26.6% and 26.2% of total features demonstrated less than 5% difference between 3D and RG protocols for CT and PET, respectively. Between 10 RG phases in PET, 53.4% of features demonstrated percent differences less than 5%. The features with least variability for PET were sphericity, spherical disproportion, entropy (first and second order), sum entropy, information measure of correlation 2, Short Run Emphasis (SRE), Long Run Emphasis (LRE), and Run Percentage (RPC); and those for CT were minimum intensity, mean intensity, Root Mean Square (RMS), Short Run Emphasis (SRE), and RPC. Quantitative analysis using a 3D acquisition versus RG acquisition (to reduce the effects of motion) provided notably different image feature values. This study suggests that the variability between 3D and RG features is mainly due to the impact of respiratory motion.",

PrAgU2/LF was cytotoxic to five out of nine AML cell lines. Cytotoxicity of PrAgU2/LF appeared to be nonapoptotic and was associated with MAPK activation and urokinase activity because all the PrAgU2/LF-sensitive cell lines showed both uPAR expression and high levels of MEK1/2 phosphorylation. Inhibition of uPAR or desensitization of cells to MEK1/2 inhibition blocked toxicity of PrAgU2/LF, indicating requirement for both uPAR expression and MAPK activation for activity. PrAgU2/LF was also cytotoxic to primary blasts from AML patients, with blasts from four out of five patients showing a cytotoxic response to PrAgU2/LF. Cytotoxicity of primary AML blasts was also dependent on uPAR expression and phos-MEK1/2 levels. CD34+ bone marrow blasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells lacked uPAR expression and were resistant to PrAgU2/LF, demonstrating the lack of toxicity to normal hematological cells and, therefore, the tumor selectivity of this approach. Dose escalation in mice revealed that the maximal tolerated dose of PrAgU2/LF is at least 5.7-fold higher than that of the wild-type anthrax lethal toxin, PrAg/LF, further demonstrating the increased safety of this molecule. We have shown, in this study, that PrAgU2/LF is a novel, dual-specific molecule for the selective targeting of AML.",

Presently, there are no effective therapies against IBC and a paucity of model systems. Our aim was to develop a clinically relevant IBC model that would allow investigations on the role of chemokine receptors in IBC metastasis. Primary cultures of tumor cells were isolated from pleural exudates of an IBC patient and grown as spheres or monolayers. We developed a human xenograft model where patient-derived IBC cells, stably transduced with lentiviral vectors expressing fluorescent and bioluminescent markers, were inoculated directly into the left ventricle of mice. Our in vivo data show that these IBC cells (FC-IBC02A) are able to seed and proliferate into various organs, including brain, lungs, lymph nodes, and bone, closely replicating the metastatic spread observed in IBC patients. Moreover, cells were able to generate tumors when grafted in the mammary fat pad of mice. RT-PCR and microscopy studies revealed expression of both CXCR4 and ACKR3 receptors in FC-IBC02A cells. Furthermore, CXCL12 (the endogenous chemokine ligand of these receptors) induced transendothelial migration of these cells and stimulated signaling pathways involved in cell survival and migration - an effect reduced by CXCR4 or ACKR3 antagonists. This new model can be used to develop chemokine-based pharmacological approaches against the IBC metastatic process. This work also provides the first evidence of ACKR3 expression in IBC cells.",

     "abstract": "Although recent progress in understanding the biology and optimizing the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has improved cure rates of childhood ALL to nearly 90%, the cure rate in adult ALL remains less than 50%. The poor prognosis in adult ALL has in part been attributed to larger proportion of high-risk leukemia showing drug resistance. Thus, identifying novel therapeutic targets in ALL is needed for further improvements in treatment outcomes of adult ALL. Genetic aberration of chromatin-modifying molecules has been recently reported in subtypes of ALL, and targeting components of chromatin complexes has shown promising efficacy in preclinical studies. Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homologue 2 (SUV39H2), also known as KMT1B, is a SET-domain\u2013containing histone methyltransferase that is upregulated in solid cancers, but its expression is hardly detectable in normal tissues. Here, we show that SUV39H2 is highly expressed in ALL cells but not in blood cells from healthy donors and also that SUV39H2 mRNA is expressed at significantly higher levels in bone marrow or blood cells from patients with ALL obtained at diagnosis compared with those obtained at remission (P = .007). In four ALL cell lines (Jurkat and CEM derived from T-ALL and RS4;11 and REH derived from B-ALL), SUV39H2 knockdown resulted in a significant decrease in cell viability (~\u00a077%, P < .001), likely through induction of apoptosis. On the other hand, SUV39H2 overexpression made cells more resistant to chemotherapy. We conclude that SUV39H2 is a promising therapeutic target and further investigation of this therapeutic approach in ALL is warranted.",

One of the main reasons for this poor outcome is the tumor\u2019s inherent resistance to chemotherapy. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is overactive in many human cancers, and inhibition of STAT3 signaling is an emerging area of interest in oncology. In this study, the possibility of STAT3 inhibition as a treatment was investigated in pediatric intracranial ependymoma tissues and cell lines. STAT3 activation status was checked in ependymoma tissues. The responses to conventional chemotherapeutic agents and a STAT3 inhibitor WP1066 in primarily cultured ependymoma cells were measured by cell viability assay. Apoptosis assays were conducted to reveal the cytotoxic mechanism of applied agents. Knockdown of STAT3 was tried to confirm the effects of STAT3 inhibition in ependymoma cells. High levels of phospho-STAT3 (p-STAT3) expression were observed in ependymoma tissue, especially in the anaplastic histology group. There was no cytotoxic effect of cisplatin, ifosfamide, and etoposide. Both brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) and bulk tumor cells (BCs) showed considerably decreased viability after WP1066 treatment. However, BTICs had fewer responses than BCs. No additive or synergistic effect was observed for combination therapy of WP1066 and cisplatin. WP1066 effectively abrogated p-STAT3 expression. An increased apoptosis and decreased Survivin expression were observed after WP1066 treatment. Knockdown of STAT3 also decreased cell survival, supporting the critical role of STAT3 in sustaining ependymoma cells. In this study, we observed a cytotoxic effect of STAT3 inhibitor on ependymoma BTICs and BCs. There is urgent need to develop new therapeutic agents for pediatric ependymoma. STAT3 inhibitors may be a new group of drugs for clinical application.",

     "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) causes significant morbidity and remains the most expensive cancer to treat because of the need for repeated resections and lifelong monitoring for patients with non\u2013muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC). Novel therapeutics and stratification approaches are needed to improve the outlook for both NMIBC and muscle-invasive bladder cancer. We investigated the expression and effects of B Lymphoma Mo-MLV Insertion Region 1 (BMI1) in UC. BMI1 was found to be overexpressed in most UC cell lines and primary tumors by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry. In contrast to some previous reports, no association with tumor stage or grade was observed in two independent tumor panels. Furthermore, upregulation of BMI1 was detected in premalignant bladder lesions, suggesting a role early in tumorigenesis. BMI1 is not located within a common region of genomic amplification in UC. The CDKN2A locus (which encodes the p16 tumor suppressor gene) is a transcriptional target of BMI1 in some cellular contexts. In UC cell lines and primary tissues, no correlation between BMI1 and p16 expression was observed. Retroviral-mediated overexpression of BMI1 immortalized normal human urothelial cells (NHUC) in vitro and was associated with induction of telomerase activity, bypass of senescence, and repression of differentiation. The effects of BMI1 on gene expression were identified by expression microarray analysis of NHUC-BMI1. Metacore analysis of the gene expression profile implicated downstream effects of BMI1 on \u03b14/\u03b21 integrin-mediated adhesion, cytoskeleton remodeling, and CREB1-mediated transcription.",

Here, we show that CAP2 expression is much higher in HCC tissues than that in paracarcinoma tissues, at both mRNA and protein levels. Data of immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that CAP2 was markedly up-regulated in 77.3% of HCC cases. High CAP2 expression, defined by the median score of IHC, was present in 53.3% of the patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that high CAP2 expression was associated with poor overall survival (P < .0001), disease-free survival (P = .013) and recurrence probability (P = .004) in a training cohort of 312 HCC patients. The prognostic implication of CAP2 in HCC was further confirmed in a validation cohort of 208 HCC patients and by stratified survival analysis. Multiple Cox regression analysis indicated CAP2 as an independent predictor for overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.615, 95% confidence interval: 1.345-1.938, P < .001). Collectively, we conclude that CAP2 is increased in HCC and is a novel unfavorable biomarker for prognostic prediction for patients with this deadly disease.",

We determined the three-dimensional orientation of chromosome 11 using a mouse chromosome 11 specific multicolor banding probe. We also examined the nuclear position of the small translocation chromosome T(X;11) which contains cytoband 11E2 and parts of E1. Chromosomes can point either with their centromeric or with their telomeric end toward the nuclear center or periphery, or their position is found in parallel to the nuclear border. In T38HT(X;11) nuclei, the most frequently observed orientation pattern was with both chromosomes 11 in parallel to the nuclear border (\u201cPP\u201d). PCT cells showed nuclei with two or more copies of chromosome 11. In PCTs, the most frequent orientation pattern was with one chromosome in parallel and the other pointing with its centromeric end toward the nuclear periphery (\u201cCP\u201d).

We explored the prognostic impact of sex steroid hormone receptor protein and mRNA expression on survival in epithelial ovarian cancer. Methods: Immunohistochemical stainings for ER\u03b1, ER\u03b2, PR, and AR were assessed in relation to survival in 118 serous and endometrioid ovarian cancers. Expression of the genes encoding the four receptors was studied in relation to prognosis in the molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer in an independent data set, hypothesizing that the expression levels and prognostic impact may differ between the subtypes. Results: Expression of PR or AR protein was associated with improved 5-year progression-free (P\u00a0=\u00a0.001 for both) and overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001 for both, log-rank test). ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 did not provide prognostic information. Patients whose tumors coexpressed PR and AR had the most favorable prognosis, and this effect was retained in multivariable analyses. Analyses of the corresponding genes using an independent data set revealed differences among the molecular subtypes, but no clear relationship between high coexpression of PGR and AR and prognosis. Conclusions: A favorable outcome was seen for patients whose tumors coexpressed PR and AR. Gene expression data suggested variable effects in the different molecular subtypes. These findings demonstrate a prognostic role for PR and AR in ovarian cancer and support that tumors should be stratified based on molecular as well as histological subtypes in future studies investigating the role of endocrine treatment in ovarian cancer.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: This investigation sought to elucidate the relationship between hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)\u2013induced metastatic behavior and the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) crizotinib and dasatinib in canine osteosarcoma (OS). Preliminary evidence of an apparent clinical benefit from adjuvant therapy with dasatinib in four dogs is described. METHODS: The inhibitors were assessed for their ability to block phosphorylation of MET; reduce HGF-induced production of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP); and prevent invasion, migration, and cell viability in canine OS cell lines. Oral dasatinib (0.75 mg/kg) was tested as an adjuvant therapy in four dogs with OS. RESULTS: Constitutive phosphorylation of MET was detected in two cell lines, and this was unaffected by 20-nM incubation with either dasatinib or crizotinib. Incubation of cell lines with HGF (MET ligand) increased cell migration and invasion in both cell lines and increased MMP-9 activity in one. Dasatinib suppressed OS cell viability and HGF-induced invasion and migration, whereas crizotinib reduced migration and MMP-9 production but did not inhibit invasion or viability. CONCLUSIONS: Invasion, migration, and viability of canine OS cell lines are increased by exogenous HGF. HGF induces secretion of different forms of MMP in different cell lines. The HGF-driven increase in viability and metastatic behaviors we observed are more uniformly inhibited by dasatinib. These observations suggest a potential clinical benefit of adjuvant dasatinib treatment for dogs with OS.",

In this study, we aimed, using immunohistochemical detection, whether the co-expression of PARP1, \u03b3H2AX, BRCA1, and BRCA2 in breast carcinoma (BCA) tissue can provide more reliable prediction of survival of BCA patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated immunohistochemical expression and prognostic significance of the expression of PARP1, \u03b3H2AX, BRCA1, and BRCA2 in 192 cases of BCAs. RESULTS: The expression of these four molecules predicted earlier distant metastatic relapse, shorter overall survival (OS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) by univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed the expression of PARP1, \u03b3H2AX, and BRCA2 as independent poor prognostic indicators of OS and RFS. In addition, the combined expressional pattern of BRCA1, BRCA2, PARP1, and \u03b3H2AX (CSbbph) was an additional independent prognostic predictor for OS (P < .001) and RFS (P < .001). The 10-year OS rate was 95% in the CSbbph-low (CSbbph scores 0 and 1) subgroup, but that was only 35% in the CSbbph-high (CSbbph score 4) subgroup. CONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that the individual and combined expression patterns of PARP1, \u03b3H2AX, BRCA1, and BRCA2 could be helpful in determining an accurate prognosis for BCA patients and for the selection of BCA patients who could potentially benefit from anti-PARP1 therapy with a combination of genotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study presented a three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR)\u2013based method to separate a breast into four quadrants for quantitative measurements of the quadrant breast volume (BV) and density. METHODS: Breast MR images from 58 healthy women were studied. The breast and the fibroglandular tissue were segmented by using a computer-based algorithm. A breast was divided into four quadrants using two perpendicular planes intersecting at the nipple or the nipple-centroid line. After the separation, the BV, the fibroglandular tissue volume, and the percent density (PD) were calculated. The symmetry of the quadrant BV in the left and right breasts separated by using the nipple alone, or the nipple-centroid line, was compared. RESULTS: The quadrant separation made on the basis of the nipple-centroid line showed closer BVs in four quadrants than using the nipple alone. The correlation and agreement for the BV in corresponding quadrants of the left and the right breasts were improved after the nipple-centroid reorientation. Among the four quadrants, PD was the highest in the lower outer and the lowest in the upper outer (significant than the other three) quadrants (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: We presented a quantitative method to divide a breast into four quadrants. The reorientation based on the nipple-centroid line improved the left to right quadrant symmetry, and this may provide a better standardized method to measure quantitative quadrant density. The cancer occurrence rates are known to vary in different sites of a breast, and our method may provide a tool for investigating its association with the quantitative breast density.",

This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value and safety of CBCT-guided PTLB compared to CCT-guided biopsy, with cases performed in a single hospital. METHODS: A total of 104 PTLB patients were retrospectively analyzed in this study. 35 PTLBs were performed under CBCT guidance, and 69 PTLBs were performed under CCT guidance. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for malignancy as well as procedure time, radiation dose of patients, and complication rate in the two groups were compared. RESULTS: Total procedure time was significantly lower in the CBCT group (32 \u00b1 11 minutes) compared to the CCT group (38 \u00b1 9.7 minutes; P = .009), especially among patients \u2265\u00a070 years of age (CBCT: 33 \u00b1 12 minutes, CCT: 42 \u00b1 13, P = .022). For lesions in the lower lobes, the CBCT-guided group received significantly reduced effective radiation dose (2.9 \u00b1 1.6 mSv) than CCT-guided patients (3.7 \u00b1 0.80; P = .042). Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for malignancy were comparable between the two groups, as were post-biopsy complication rates. CONCLUSION: CBCT guidance significantly reduces the procedure time and radiation exposure for PTLBs compared with CCT, and should be considered in clinical settings that may be difficult or time-consuming to perform under CCT.",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the relevance of clinical-pathologic factors and prognosis in young (\u2264\u00a035) breast cancer patients. METHODS: One hundred thirty-two patients of operable breast cancer who were younger than 35 are analyzed in this study. They were treated in our hospital between January 2006 and December 2012. Patients are classified into four molecular subtypes based on the immunohistochemical profiles of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and Ki-67. Clinical and pathologic factors have been combined to define a specific classification of three risk levels to evaluate the prognosis of these young women. RESULTS: Patients whose ages are less than 30 have poorer prognosis than patients whose ages are between 31 and 35. The status of lymph nodes post-surgery seems to be the only factor related to patient age in young patients. The patients in level of ER\u00a0+ or PR\u00a0+ and HER2\u00a0\u2212/+ status have the worst prognosis in hormone receptor\u2013positive breast cancer. Group 3 in risk factor grouping has the poorer prognosis than the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patient age and axillary lymph nodes post-surgery are the independent and significant predictors of distant disease-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, and overall survival. The absence of PR relates to poor prognosis. The risk factor grouping provides a useful index to evaluate the risk of young breast cancer to identify subgroups of patients with a better prognosis.",

     "abstract": "Although several molecular markers have been proposed as prognostic of disease progression in Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), predictive markers of response to treatment are still unsatisfactory. Here, we propose a genetic polymorphism as a potential predictive factor of poor prognosis in HCC patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). In particular, we show that the guanosine insertion/deletion polymorphism in the promoter region of SERPINE1 gene at the \u2212\u00a0675 bp position, named 4G/4G, predicts poor prognosis in a cohort of 75 patients with HCC undergoing TACE. By a combination of ELISA and SERPINE1 promoter study, we found that the presence of elevated plasma levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in patients with 4G/4G genotype is significantly associated with reduced overall survival compared to patients with 5G/5G or 4G/5G genotype in HCC patients after TACE. Our analysis provided evidence that variation in SERPINE1 gene plays a role in defining the outcome in patients treated with TACE. In addition to a poor disease outcome, the 4G/4G variant represents an unfavorable predictive factor for response to chemotherapy as well.",

The status of gene expression in R-GBM tissue was compared with that of normal brain tissue and conventional GBM tumor tissue. We identified 23 somatic non-synonymous small nucleotide variants with WES. We identified the BRAF V600E mutation and possible functional changes in the mutated genes, ISL1 and NDRG2. Copy number alteration analysis revealed gains of chromosomes 3, 7, and 9. We found loss of heterozygosity and focal homozygous deletion on 9q21, which includes CDKN2A and CDKN2B. In addition, WTS revealed that CDK6, MET, EZH2, EGFR, and NOTCH1, which are located on chromosomes 7 and 9, were over-expressed, whereas CDKN2A/2B were minimally expressed. Fusion gene analysis showed 14 candidate genes that may be functionally involved in R-GBM, including TWIST2, and UPK3BL. The BRAF V600E mutation, CDKN2A/2B deletion, and EGFR/MET copy number gain were observed. These simultaneous alterations are very rarely found in GBM.

Hypermethylation of the promoter represses expression of the IGFBP-3 gene. We undertook this study to assess the impact of IGFBP-3 methylation on survival of early stage gastric cancer patients. METHODS: Of the 482 tissue samples from gastric cancer patients who underwent curative surgery, IGFBP-3 methylation was tested in 138 patients with stage IB/II gastric cancer. We also analyzed IGFBP-3 methylation in 26 gastric cancer cell lines. IGFBP-3 methylation was evaluated by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MethyLight). Statistical analyses, all two-sided, were performed to investigate the prognostic effects of methylation status of the IGFBP-3 promoter on various clinical parameters. RESULTS: Hypermethylation of IGFBP-3 was observed in 26 (19%) of the 138 stage IB/II gastric cancer patients. Clinicopathological factors such as age, Lauren classification, sex, tumor infiltration, lymph node metastasis, and histologic grade did not show a statistically significant association with the methylation status of the IGFBP-3 promoter. Patients with a hypermethylated IGFBP-3 promoter had similar 8-year disease-free survival compared with those without a hypermethylated IGFBP-3 promoter (73% vs 75%, P = .78). In subgroup analyses, females, but not males, seemed to have poorer prognosis for DFS and OS in the subset of patients with IGFBP-3 methylation as compared with those without IGFBP-3 methylation (8-year DFS: 55.6% vs 71.6%, P = .3694 and 8-year overall survival: 55.6% vs 68.4%, P = .491, respectively) even with no statistical significance.

Therefore, better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying melanoma progression and metastasis, as well as identification of novel therapeutic targets that allow inhibition of metastatic spread, are urgently required. The current study provides evidence for aberrant cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) activation in primary and metastatic melanoma lesions by overexpression of its activator protein CDK5R1/p35. Moreover, using melanoma in vitro model systems, shRNA-mediated inducible knockdown of CDK5 was found to cause marked inhibition of cell motility, invasiveness, and anchorage-independent growth, while at the same time net cell growth was not affected. In vivo, CDK5 knockdown inhibited growth of orthotopic xenografts as well as formation of lung and liver colonies in xenogenic injection models mimicking systemic metastases. Inhibition of lung metastasis was further validated in a syngenic murine melanoma model. CDK5 knockdown was accompanied by dephosphorylation and overexpression of caldesmon, and concomitant caldesmon knockdown rescued cell motility and proinvasive phenotype. Finally, it was found that pharmacological inhibition of CDK5 activity by means of roscovitine as well as by a novel small molecule CDK5-inhibitor, N-(5-isopropylthiazol-2-yl)-3-phenylpropanamide, similarly caused marked inhibition of invasion/migration, colony formation, and anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells. Thus, experimental data presented here provide strong evidence for a crucial role of aberrantly activated CDK5 in melanoma progression and metastasis and establish CDK5 as promising target for therapeutic intervention.",

Primary allogeneic one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) was the end point to assess in vitro T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to MoDCs, and secreted IL-12p70 and interferon-\u03b3 in MLR supernatants measured by ELISA to assay for T-helper 1\u2013promoting MoDC phenotype. No single agent enhanced the compromised allostimulatory activity of MoDCs from colon cancer patients, unlike healthy donors. However, MoDCs from nonmetastatic colon cancer patients, after sequential exposure to SKA-IL-4 (48 hours) and SKA-IL-12 (24 hours), displayed increased T-cell stimulatory capacity by MLR and acquired driving T-helper 1 polarization activity, although less markedly than the effects induced by recombinant human cytokines or found in normal subjects. These results point to an immunomodulatory capacity of low-dose SKA-IL-4 and SKA-IL-12 and encourage further investigation to provide clues for the rational development of new and more effective immunotherapeutic strategies against cancer.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An elevated preoperative C-reactive protein/albumin (CRP/Alb) ratio has been reported to be associated with a poor prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prognostic value of the preoperative CRP/Alb ratio and compare it with other systemic inflammatory response markers in patients with gastric cancer (GC). METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in 455 patients with GC undergoing curative resection. We investigated the correlations between the preoperative CRP/Alb ratio and overall survival (OS). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models were used to assess independent prognostic factors. The area under the curve was used to compare the prognostic value of different markers. RESULTS: On multivariate analysis, the CRP/Alb ratio were independently associated with OS in patients with GC (hazard ratio: 1.626; 95% confidence interval: 1.191-2.219; P = .002), along with age (P = .003), preoperative body weight loss (P = .001), tumor location (P = .008), metastatic lymph node ratio (P < .001), and seventh tumor-nodes-metastasis stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer) (P = .007). However, several other systemic inflammation\u2013based prognostic scores (neutrophil lymphocyte ratio, platelet lymphocyte ratio and systemic immune-inflammation index, Glasgow Prognostic Score, modified Glasgow prognostic score, and high-sensitivity modified Glasgow prognostic score) were not. In addition, the CRP/Alb ratio had a higher area under the curve value (0.625) compared with several other systemic inflammation\u2013based prognostic scores (P < .001). CONCLUSION: The preoperative CRP/Alb ratio, a system inflammation-based prognostic score, is a superior predictor of OS in patients undergoing curative resection for GC and may help to identify the high-risk patients for treatment decisions.",

Perfusion maps including cerebral blood volume (CBV) and cerebral blood flow (CBF) were generated using two contrast agent leakage correction methods, along with testing normalization to reference tissue, and application of arterial input function (AIF). Repeatability of CBV and CBF within tumor regions and healthy tissues, identified by structural images, was assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and repeatability coefficients (RCs). Coefficients of variation (CVs) were reported for selected methods.CBV and CBF were highly repeatable within tumor with ICC values up to 0.97. However, both CBV and CBF showed lower ICCs for healthy cortical tissues (up to 0.83), healthy gray matter (up to 0.95), and healthy white matter (WM; up to 0.93). The values of CV ranged from 6% to 10% in tumor and 3% to 11% in healthy tissues. The values of RC relative to the mean value of measurement within healthy WM ranged from 22% to 42% in tumor and 7% to 43% in healthy tissues. These percentages show how much variation in perfusion parameter, relative to that in healthy WM, we expect to observe to consider it statistically significant. We also found that normalization improved repeatability, but AIF deconvolution did not.DSC-MRI is highly repeatable in high-grade glioma patients.",

Herein, we present an in vivo study of [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) designed to evaluate the metabolism within the microenvironment of LAPC4-CR, a unique murine model of castration-resistant prostate cancer. Mice bearing LAPC4-CR subcutaneous tumors were administered [18F]-FDG via intravenous injection. After a 60-minute distribution phase, the mice were imaged on a PET/CT scanner with submillimeter resolution; and the fused PET/CT images were analyzed to evaluate tumor size, location, and metabolism across the cohort of mice. The xenograft tumors showed [18F]-FDG uptake that was independent of tumor size and was significantly greater than uptake in skeletal muscle and liver in mice (Wilcoxon signed-rank P values of .0002 and .0002, respectively). [18F]-FDG metabolism of the LAPC4-CR tumors was 2.1 \u00b1 0.8 ID/cm3*wt, with tumor to muscle ratio of 7.4 \u00b1 4.7 and tumor to liver background ratio of 6.7 \u00b1 2.3. Noninvasive molecular imaging techniques such as PET/CT can be used to probe the microenvironment of tumors in vivo. This study showed that [18F]-FDG-PET/CT could be used to image and assess glucose metabolism of LAPC4-CR xenografts in vivo.

     "abstract": "The ability to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy for women diagnosed with breast cancer, either before or early on in treatment, is critical to judicious patient selection and tailoring the treatment regimen. In this paper, we investigate the role of contrast agent kinetic heterogeneity features derived from breast dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) for predicting treatment response. We propose a set of kinetic statistic descriptors and present preliminary results showing the discriminatory capacity of the proposed descriptors for predicting complete and non-complete responders as assessed from pre-treatment imaging exams. The study population consisted of 15 participants: 8 complete responders and 7 non-complete responders. Using the proposed kinetic features, we trained a leave-one-out logistic regression classifier that performs with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.84 under the ROC. We compare the predictive value of our features against commonly used MRI features including kinetics of the characteristic kinetic curve (CKC), maximum peak enhancement (MPE), hotspot signal enhancement ratio (SER), and longest tumor diameter that give lower AUCs of 0.71, 0.66, 0.64, and 0.54, respectively. Our proposed kinetic statistics thus outperform the conventional kinetic descriptors as well as the classifier using a combination of all the conventional descriptors (i.e., CKC, MPE, SER, and longest diameter), which gives an AUC of 0.74. These findings suggest that heterogeneity-based DCE-MRI kinetic statistics could serve as potential imaging biomarkers for tumor characterization and could be used to improve candidate patient selection even before the start of the neoadjuvant treatment.",

This study is aimed to investigate the feasibility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) on early assessing treatment of HIFU ablation in rabbit with VX2 liver tumor. HIFU ablation was performed on normal liver and VX2 tumor in rabbit, and MRS was performed on normal liver and VX2 tumor before and 2 days after 100% HIFU ablation or 80% ablation in tumor volume. Choline (Cho) and choline/lipid (Cho/Lip) ratios between complete and partial HIFU ablation of tumor were compared. Tissues were harvested and sequentially sliced to confirm the necrosis. In normal liver, the Cho value liver was not obviously changed after HIFU (P > .05), but the Cho/Lip ratio was decreased (P < .05). Cho in liver VX2 tumor was much higher than that in normal liver (P < .001). Cho and Cho/Lip ratio were significantly decreased in tumor after complete HIFU ablation and partial HIFU ablation, and the Cho value in complete HIFU tumor ablation did not show any difference from that in normal liver after HIFU (P > .05); however, the Cho value in partial ablation was still higher than that in normal liver before or in tumor after complete HIFU treatment due to the residual part of tumors, and Cho/Lip ratio is lower than that in complete HIFU treatment (P < .001). The changes in MRS parameters were consistent with histopathologic changes of the tumor tissues after treatment. MRS could differentiate the complete tumor necrosis from residual tumor tissue, when combined with magnetic resonance imaging. We conclude that MRS may be applied as an important, non-invasive biomarker for monitoring the thoroughness of HIFU ablation.",

The aim of this study is to present our monocenter database on cAS-HN so far and a new predictive score for locoregional metastasis (LRM). METHODS: Retrospectively, tumor characteristics and outcome of 103 consecutive patients with cAS-HN were analyzed. The main predictors of LRM (identified by univariate and multivariate statistics) were combined to a LRM risk score. The prognostic values of stratification into high-, medium-, and low-risk groups concerning disease-specific survival (DSS), distant metastasis (DM), and progression-free survival (PFS) were evaluated. RESULTS: LRM (n = 29) and control (n = 74) groups differed significantly concerning several tumor characteristics and outcome (DM, PFS, and DSS). Patients developing LRM showed 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival rates of 32%, 16%, and 11% (mean DSS time of 36.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 20.5-52.8]) compared to 81%, 73%, and 69% (mean DSS time of 292.4 months [95% CI 208.4-376.5]) in controls without LRM (P < .001). The main predictors were American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, tumor extent, and origin of the primary tumor. The LRM risk score revealed significant higher values for the LRM group [7.14 (SD 1.46) vs 4.88 (SD 1.89), P < .001]. The high-risk group showed significantly higher risk for DM and more unfavorable DSS and PFS.

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Brain metastases due to breast cancer are increasing, and the prognosis is poor. Lack of effective therapy is attributed to heterogeneity of breast cancers and their resulting metastases, as well as impermeability of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which hinders delivery of therapeutics to the brain. This work investigates three experimental models of HER2\u00a0+ breast cancer brain metastasis to better understand the inherent heterogeneity of the disease. We use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to quantify brain metastatic growth and explore its relationship with BBB permeability. DESIGN: Brain metastases due to breast cancer cells (SUM190-BR3, JIMT-1-BR3, or MDA-MB-231-BR-HER2) were imaged at 3 T using balanced steady-state free precession and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spin echo sequences. The histology and immunohistochemistry corresponding to MRI were also analyzed. RESULTS: There were differences in metastatic tumor appearance by MRI, histology, and immunohistochemistry (Ki67, CD31, CD105) across the three models. The mean volume of an MDA-MB-231-BR-HER2 tumor was significantly larger compared to other models (F2,12 = 5.845, P < .05); interestingly, this model also had a significantly higher proportion of Gd-impermeable tumors (F2,12 = 22.18, P < .0001). Ki67 staining indicated that Gd-impermeable tumors had significantly more proliferative nuclei compared to Gd-permeable tumors (t[24] = 2.389, P < .05) in the MDA-MB-231-BR-HER2 model. CD31 and CD105 staining suggested no difference in new vasculature patterns between permeable and impermeable tumors in any model. CONCLUSION: Significant heterogeneity is present in these models of brain metastases from HER2\u00a0+ breast cancer. Understanding this heterogeneity, especially as it relates to BBB permeability, is important for improvement in brain metastasis detection and treatment delivery.",

Despite many clinical trials, no single chemotherapy agent has been reliably associated with objective response rates above 10% or median survival longer than 5 to 7 months. Although combination chemotherapy regimens have in recent years provided some improvement, overall survival (8-11 months) remains very poor.

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: This study investigated the association between background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) and pathologic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). METHODS: A total of 46 patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer were analyzed. Each patient had three magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, one pre-treatment and two follow-up (F/U) MRI studies. BPE was measured as the averaged enhancement of the whole fibroglandular tissues. The pre-treatment BPE and the changes in the F/U MRI were compared between patients achieving pathologic complete response (pCR) versus those not. Subgroup analyses based on age, estrogen receptor (ER), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status of their cancers were also performed. RESULTS: The pre-treatment BPE was higher in the pCR group than that in the non-pCR group. Compared to baseline, BPE at F/U-1 was significantly decreased in the pCR group but not in the non-pCR group. In subgroup analysis based on age, these results were seen only in the younger group (<\u00a055 years old), not in the older group (\u2265\u00a055 years old). Older patients had a significantly lower pre-treatment BPE than younger patients. In analysis based on molecular biomarkers, a significantly decreased BPE at F/U-1 was only found in the ER-negative pCR group but not in the non-pCR, nor in the ER-positive groups. CONCLUSIONS: A higher pre-treatment BPE showing a significant decrease early after starting NAC was related to pCR in pre/peri-menopausal patients.",

Availability of cell culture models with acquired resistance could help to identify candidate treatments for an efficient second-line therapy. Six cisplatin- and six gemcitabine-resistant cell lines were established. Cell viability assays were performed to evaluate the sensitivity to 16 different chemotherapeutic substances. The activity of the drug transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter, subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1, a critical mediator of multidrug resistance in cancer) was evaluated using fluorescent ABCB1 substrates. For functional assessment, cells overexpressing ABCB1 were generated by transduction with a lentiviral vector encoding for ABCB1, while zosuquidar was used for selective inhibition. In this study, 8 of 12 gemcitabine- or cisplatin-resistant cell lines were cross-resistant to carboplatin, 5 to pemetrexed, 4 to methotrexate, 3 to oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and paclitaxel, and 2 to cabazitaxel, larotaxel, docetaxel, topotecan, doxorubicin, and mitomycin c, and 1 of 12 cell lines was cross-resistant to vinflunine and vinblastine. In one cell line with acquired resistance to gemcitabine (TCC-SUPrGEMCI20), cross-resistance seemed to be mediated by ABCB1 expression. Our model identified the vinca alkaloids vinblastine and vinflunine, in Europe an already approved second-line therapeutic for metastatic bladder cancer, as the most effective compounds in urothelial cancer cells with acquired resistance to gemcitabine or cisplatin. These results demonstrate that this in vitro model can reproduce clinically relevant results and may be suitable to identify novel substances for the treatment of metastatic bladder cancer.",

     "abstract": "Adequately selecting a therapeutic approach for bladder cancer depends on accurate grading and staging. Substantial inaccuracy of clinical staging with bimanual examination, cystoscopy, and transurethral resection of bladder tumor has facilitated the increasing utility of magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate bladder cancer. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a noninvasive functional magnetic resonance imaging technique. The high tissue contrast between cancers and surrounding tissues on DWI is derived from the difference of water molecules motion. DWI is potentially a useful tool for the detection, characterization, and staging of bladder cancers; it can also monitor posttreatment response and provide information on predicting tumor biophysical behaviors. Despite advancements in DWI techniques and the use of quantitative analysis to evaluate the apparent diffusion coefficient values, there are some inherent limitations in DWI interpretation related to relatively poor spatial resolution, lack of cancer specificity, and lack of standardized image acquisition protocols and data analysis procedures that restrict the application of DWI and reproducibility of apparent diffusion coefficient values. In addition, inadequate bladder distension, artifacts, thinness of bladder wall, cancerous mimickers of normal bladder wall and benign lesions, and variations in the manifestation of bladder cancer may interfere with diagnosis and monitoring of treatment. Recognition of these pitfalls and limitations can minimize their impact on image interpretation, and carefully applying the analyzed results and combining with pathologic grading and staging to clinical practice can contribute to the selection of an adequate treatment method to improve patient care.",

This study aims at defining connections between STAT3 function and the malignant properties of non\u2013small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. To address possible mechanisms by which STAT3 influences invasiveness, the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) was analyzed and correlated with the STAT3 activity status. Studies on both surgical biopsies and on lung cancer cell lines revealed a coincidence of STAT3 activation and strong expression of MMP-1. MMP-1 and tyrosine-phosphorylated activated STAT3 were found co-localized in cancer tissues, most pronounced in tumor fronts, and in particular in adenocarcinomas. STAT3 activity was constitutive, although to different degrees, in the lung cancer cell lines investigated. Three cell lines (BEN, KNS62, and A549) were identified in which STAT3 activitation was inducible by Interleukin-6 (IL-6). In A549 cells, STAT3 activity enhanced the level of MMP-1 mRNA and stimulated transcription from the MMP-1 promoter in IL-6\u2013stimulated A549 cells. STAT3 specificity of this effect was confirmed by STAT3 knockdown through RNA interference. Our results link aberrant activity of STAT3 in lung cancer cells to malignant tumor progression through up-regulation of expression of invasiveness-associated MMPs.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Due to the low specificity of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assay and a high false positive rate, a large number of prostate cancer (PCA) biopsies are performed unnecessarily. Consequently, there is a need for new biomarkers that can identify PCA at any stage of progression while limiting the number of false positives. The use of autoantibody signature\u2013developed biomarkers has proven to be an effective method to solve this problem. RESULTS: Using T7 phage\u2013peptide detection, we identified a panel of eight biomarkers for PCA on a training set. The estimated receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve had an area under the ROC curve of 0.69 when applied to the validation set. Spearman correlations were high, within 0.7 to 0.9, indicating that the biomarkers have a degree of inter-relatedness. The identified biomarkers play a role in processes such as androgen response regulation and cellular structural integrity and are proteins that are thought to play a role in prostate tumorigenesis. CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibodies against PCA can be developed as biomarkers for detecting PCA. The scores from the algorithm developed here can be used to indicate a relative high or low risk of PCA, particularly for patients with intermediate (4.0 to 10 ng/ml) PSA levels. Since most commercially available assays test for PSA or have a PSA component, this novel approach has the potential to improve diagnosis of PCA using a biologic measure independent of PSA.",

CK6 as a single agent only reduced tumor growth rate in the UZLX-GIST3 model (P = .053, MWU compared to control), while in none of the other GIST models an effect on tumor growth rate was observed. CK6 did not result in significant anti-proliferative or pro-apoptotic effects in any of the GIST models, and moreover, CK6 did not induce a remarkable inhibition of KIT activation. Furthermore, no synergistic effect of combining CK6 with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was observed. Conversely, in certain GIST xenografts, anti-tumor effects seemed to be inferior under combination treatment compared to single-agent TKI treatment. In the GIST xenografts tested, the anti-tumor efficacy of CK6 was limited. No synergy was observed on combination of CK6 with TKIs in these GIST models. Our findings highlight the importance of using relevant in vivo human tumor xenograft models in the preclinical assessment of drug combination strategies.",

     "abstract": "Lymph node metastasis (LNM) in many solid cancers is a well-known prognostic factor; however, it has been debated whether regional LNM simply reflects tumor aggressiveness or is a source for further tumor dissemination. Similarly, the metastatic process in head and neck cancer (HNC) has not been fully evaluated. Thus, we aimed to investigate the relative significance of LNM in metastatic cascade of HNC using functional imaging of HNC patients and molecular imaging in in vivo models. First, we analyzed 18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) parameters of 117 patients with oral cancer. The primary tumor and nodal PET parameters were measured separately, and survival analyses were conducted on the basis of clinical and PET variables to identify significant prognostic factors. In multivariate analyses, we found that only the metastatic node PET values were significant. Next, we compared the relative frequency of lung metastasis in primary ear tumors versus lymph node (LN) tumors, and we tested the rate of lung metastasis in another animal model, in which each animal had both primary and LN tumors that were expressing different colors. As a result, LN tumors showed higher frequencies of lung metastasis compared to orthotopic primary tumors. In color-matched comparisons, the relative contribution to lung metastasis was higher in LN tumors than in primary tumors, although both primary and LN tumors caused lung metastases. In summary, tumors growing in the LN microenvironment spread to systemic sites more commonly than primary tumors in HNC, suggesting that the adequate management of LNM can reduce further systemic metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of lung cancer closely recapitulate the human disease but suffer from the difficulty of evaluating tumor growth by conventional methods. Herein, a novel automated image analysis method for estimating the lung tumor burden from in vivo micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) data is described. The proposed tumor burden metric is the segmented soft tissue volume contained within a chest space region of interest, excluding an estimate of the heart volume. The method was validated by comparison with previously published manual analysis methods and applied in two therapeutic studies in a mutant K-ras GEMM of non\u2013small cell lung carcinoma. Mice were imaged by micro-CT pre-treatment and stratified into four treatment groups: an antibody inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), chemotherapy, combination of anti-VEGF and chemotherapy, or control antibody. In the first study, post-treatment imaging was performed 4 weeks later. In the second study, mice were scanned serially on a high-throughput scanner every 2 weeks for 8 weeks during treatment. In both studies, the automated tumor burden estimates were well correlated with manual metrics (r value range: 0.83-0.93, P < .0001) and showed a similar, significant reduction in tumor growth in mice treated with anti-VEGF alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Given the fully automated nature of this technique, the proposed analysis method can provide a valuable tool in preclinical drug research for screening and randomizing animals into treatment groups and evaluating treatment efficacy in mouse models of lung cancer in a highly robust and efficient manner.",

Our group previously reported that in vitro riluzole treatment reduces cell growth in three-dimensional (3D) soft agar colony assays by 80% in cells with wildtype phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation. However, melanoma cell lines harboring constitutive activating mutations of the PI3K pathway (PTEN and NRAS mutations) showed only a 35% to 40% decrease in colony formation in soft agar in the presence of riluzole. In this study, we have continued our preclinical studies of riluzole and its effect on melanoma cells alone and in combination with inhibitors of the PI3 kinase pathway: the AKT inhibitor, API-2, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin. We modeled these combinatorial therapies on various melanoma cell lines in 3D and 2D systems and in vivo. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is more effective at halting melanoma anchorage-independent growth and xenograft tumor progression than either agent alone. PI3K signaling changes associated with this combinatorial treatment shows that 3D (nanoculture) modeling of cell signaling more closely resembles in vivo signaling than monolayer models. Riluzole combined with mTOR inhibition is effective at halting tumor cell progression independent of BRAF mutational status. This makes this combinatorial therapy a potentially viable alternative for metastatic melanoma patients who are BRAF WT and are therefore ineligible for vemurafenib therapy.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)\u2013positive tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) and base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (BOTSCC) have a better clinical outcome than those with corresponding HPV-negative tumors. Moreover, there is a strong positive correlation between absent/low as opposed to strong HLA class I expression and favorable clinical outcome for HPV-positive tumors, while the reverse applies to HPV-negative tumors. The expression of the antigen processing machinery (APM) components TAP1, TAP2, LMP2, and LMP7 in these tumors in relation to HPV status, HLA class I expression, each other, and clinical outcome was therefore investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded TSCC and BOTSCC, derived from 151 patients and previously analyzed for HPV DNA, HLA class I, and LMP10 expression were stained by immunohistochemistry for TAP1, TAP2, LMP2, and LMP7. RESULTS: Absent/low TAP2, LMP2, and LMP7 expression, similar to HLA class I and LMP10, was common in TSCC and BOTSCC, irrespective of HPV status. Expression of TAP1 and TAP2 was correlated, as was LMP2 to LMP7. LMP2 and LMP7 expression was also associated to HLA class I expression. Moreover, absence of LMP7 was linked to increased disease-free survival in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative cases. CONCLUSION: Reduced expression of TAP2, LMP2, and LMP7 was frequent in TSCC and BOTSCC and their expression as well as that of TAP1 was often interrelated. Furthermore, low LMP7 expression correlated to better clinical outcome and may, together with HPV status, potentially be used for prediction of treatment response.",

A meta-analysis could potentially clarify these findings. METHODS: In September 2014, a Pubmed and Google Scholar search was conducted to find publications that reported the prognostic value of SMAD4 expression. A meta-analysis was performed to clarify the association between SMAD4 expression and survival outcomes. RESULTS: 137 studies were found, of which 13 were considered eligible. The studies consisted of a total of 3800 patients. Three different endpoints were taken into account, namely, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS). In addition, the studies were divided into univariate and multivariate analyses. The pooled hazard ratios were given as follows: univariate CSS = 1.75 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-3.32; z= 1.69; P= .09]; multivariate CSS = 2.17 (95% CI: 1.56-3.01; z= 4.65; P= .000); univariate DFS = 2.11 (95% CI: 1.36-3.28; z= 3.32; P= .001); multivariate DFS = 2.15 (95% CI: 1.56-3.01; z= 4.65; P= .000); univariate OS and DFS = 2.30 (95% CI: 1.41-3.73; z= 3.36; P= .001); univariate OS = 2.28 (95% CI: 1.30-4.00; z= 2.89; P= .004).

     "abstract": "Three-dimensional quantitative ultrasound spectroscopic imaging of prostate was investigated clinically for the noninvasive detection and extent characterization of disease in cancer patients and compared to whole-mount, whole-gland histopathology of radical prostatectomy specimens. Fifteen patients with prostate cancer underwent a volumetric transrectal ultrasound scan before radical prostatectomy. Conventional-frequency (~\u00a05\u00a0MHz) ultrasound images and radiofrequency data were collected from patients. Normalized power spectra were used as the basis of quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy. Specifically, color-coded parametric maps of 0-MHz intercept, midband fit, and spectral slope were computed and used to characterize prostate tissue in ultrasound images. Areas of cancer were identified in whole-mount histopathology specimens, and disease extent was correlated to that estimated from quantitative ultrasound parametric images. Midband fit and 0-MHz intercept parameters were found to be best associated with the presence of disease as located on histopathology whole-mount sections. Obtained results indicated a correlation between disease extent estimated noninvasively based on midband fit parametric images and that identified histopathologically on prostatectomy specimens, with an r2 value of 0.71 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The 0-MHz intercept parameter demonstrated a lower level of correlation with histopathology. Spectral slope parametric maps offered no discrimination of disease. Multiple regression analysis produced a hybrid disease characterization model (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.764, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), implying that the midband fit biomarker had the greatest correlation with the histopathologic extent of disease. This work demonstrates that quantitative ultrasound spectroscopic imaging can be used for detecting prostate cancer and characterizing disease extent noninvasively, with corresponding gross three-dimensional histopathologic correlation.",

Recent advances in the understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of mesothelioma may impact therapy to improve survival that may not be evident from available clinical trials that are often small and not randomized. Therapies may affect survival differently based on mesothelioma location (pleural vs peritoneal). Data are conflicting regarding the effect of asbestos exposure on mesothelioma location. OBJECTIVES: We examined survival in a large cohort of mesothelioma subjects analyzed by tumor location and presence and mode of asbestos exposure. METHODS: Data were analyzed from cases (n = 380) diagnosed with mesothelioma from 1992 to 2012. Cases were either drawn from treatment referrals, independent medical evaluation for medical legal purposes, or volunteers who were diagnosed with mesothelioma. Subjects completed an occupational medical questionnaire, personal interview with the examining physician, and physician review of the medical record. RESULTS: This study reports better survival for mesothelioma than historical reports. Survival for peritoneal mesothelioma was longer than that for pleural mesothelioma (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% confidence interval = 0.24-0.54, P < .001) after adjusting for gender and age at diagnosis. Non-occupational cases were more likely to be 1) diagnosed with peritoneal mesothelioma, 2) female, 3) exposed, and 4) diagnosed at a younger age and to have a 5) shorter latency compared to occupational cases (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Peritoneal mesothelioma was more likely associated with non-occupational exposure, thus emphasizing the importance of exposure history in enhancing early diagnosis and treatment impact.",

Molecular subgroup analysis of treatment outcomes in patients who had specimens available for analysis was undertaken. METHODS: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, and PIK3CA mutations were evaluated using peptide nucleic acid\u2013locked nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp reactions. Survival and response rates (RRs) were analyzed according to the mutational status. Sixty-four patients (48.1%) were available for mutational analysis in the chemotherapy alone group and 61 (45.1%) in the chemotherapy plus erlotinib group. RESULTS: 1.6% (2/116) harbored an EGFR mutation (2 patients; exon 20), 9.6% (12/121) harbored a KRAS mutation (12 patients; exon 2), and 9.6% (12/118) harbored a PIK3CA mutation (10 patients, exon 9 and 2 patients, exon 20). The addition of erlotinib to GEMOX in patients with KRAS wild-type disease (n = 109) resulted in significant improvements in overall response compared with GEMOX alone (30.2% vs 12.5%, P = .024). In 95 patients with both wild-type KRAS and PIK3CA, there was evidence of a benefit associated with the addition of erlotinib to GEMOX with respect to RR as compared with GEMOX alone (P = .04). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that KRAS mutational status might be considered a predictive biomarker for the response to erlotinib in BTCs. Additionally, the mutation status of PIK3CA may be a determinant for adding erlotinib to chemotherapy in KRAS wild-type BTCs.",

     "abstract": "In order to identify targets whose inhibition may enhance the efficacy of chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer, we previously conducted an RNAi library screen of 8,800 genes. We identified Mcl-1 (myeloid cell leukemia-1), an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, as a target for sensitizing pancreatic cancer cells to chemoradiation. In the present study we investigated Mcl-1 inhibition by either genetic or pharmacological approaches as a radiosensitizing strategy in pancreatic cancer cells. Mcl-1 depletion by siRNA produced significant radiosensitization in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells in association with Caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage, but only minimal radiosensitization in MiaPaCa-2 cells. We next tested the ability of the recently identified, selective, small molecule inhibitor of Mcl-1, UMI77, to radiosensitize in pancreatic cancer cells. UMI77 caused dissociation of Mcl-1 from the pro-apoptotic protein Bak and produced significant radiosensitization in BxPC-3 and Panc-1 cells, but minimal radiosensitization in MiaPaCa-2 cells. Radiosensitization by UMI77 was associated with Caspase-3 activation and PARP cleavage. Importantly, UMI77 did not radiosensitize normal small intestinal cells. In contrast, ABT-737, an established inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and Bcl-w, failed to radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells suggesting the unique importance of Mcl-1 relative to other Bcl-2 family members to radiation survival in pancreatic cancer cells. Taken together, these results validate Mcl-1 as a target for radiosensitization of pancreatic cancer cells and demonstrate the ability of small molecules which bind the canonical BH3 groove of Mcl-1, causing displacement of Mcl-1 from Bak, to selectively radiosensitize pancreatic cancer cells.",

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Using data sets from 32 non-small cell lung cancer patients scanned twice within 15 minutes (\u201cno change\u201d), measurements were performed by five radiologists in two phases: (1) independent reading of each computed tomography dataset (timepoint): (2) a locked, sequential reading of datasets. Readers performed measurements using several sizing methods, including one-dimensional (1D) longest in-slice dimension and 3D semi-automated segmented volume. Change in size was estimated by comparing measurements performed on both timepoints for the same lesion, for each reader and each measurement method. For each reading paradigm, results were pooled across lesions, across readers, and across both readers and lesions, for each measurement method. RESULTS: The mean percent difference (\u00b1\u00a0SD) when pooled across both readers and lesions for 1D and 3D measurements extracted from contours was 2.8 \u00b1 22.2% and 23.4 \u00b1 105.0%, respectively, for the independent reads. For the locked, sequential reads, the mean percent differences (\u00b1\u00a0SD) reduced to 2.52 \u00b1 14.2% and 7.4 \u00b1 44.2% for the 1D and 3D measurements, respectively. CONCLUSION: Even under a \u201cno change\u201d condition between scans, there is variation in lesion size measurements due to repeat scans and variations in reader, lesion, and measurement method. This variation is reduced when using a locked, sequential reading paradigm compared to an independent reading paradigm.",

Mxi1 antagonizes N-Myc by competing for binding to Max and E-boxes. Unlike N-Myc, Mxi1 mediates transcriptional repression and suppresses cell proliferation. Mxi1 and Mxi1-0 (an alternatively transcribed Mxi1 isoform) share identical Max and DNA binding domains but differ in amino-terminal sequences. Because of the conservation of these critical binding domains, we hypothesized that Mxi1-0 antagonizes N-Myc activity similar to Mxi1. SHEP NB cells and SHEP cells stably transfected with MYCN (SHEP/MYCN) were transiently transfected with vectors containing full-length Mxi1, full-length Mxi1-0, or the common Mxi domain encoded by exons 2 to 6 (ex2-6). After incubation in low serum, parental SHEP/MYCN cell numbers were reduced compared with SHEP cells. Activated caspase-3 staining and DNA fragmentation ELISA confirmed that SHEP/MYCN cells undergo apoptosis in low serum, while SHEP/MYCN cells transfected with Mxi1 or Mxi1-0 do not. However, SHEP/MYCN cells transfected with Mxi1 or Mxi1-0 and grown in normal serum showed proliferation rates similar to SHEP cells. Mxi ex2-6 did not affect cell number in low or normal serum, suggesting that amino terminal domains of Mxi1 and Mxi1-0 are critical for antagonism. In the absence of N-Myc, Mxi1 and Mxi1-0 induce apoptosis independently through the caspase-8\u2013dependent extrinsic pathway, while N-Myc activates the caspase-9\u2013dependent intrinsic pathway. Together, these data indicate that Mxi1 and Mxi1-0 antagonize N-Myc but also independently impact NB cell survival.",

For many decades, researchers have relied upon studying the histopathology of tumors in the hope that it would provide clues to understanding the pathophysiology of cancer. Current preclinical research relies heavily upon two-dimensional culture models. However, these models have had limited success in recreating the complex interactions between cancer cells and the stroma environment in vivo. Thus, there is increasing impetus to shift to three-dimensional models, which more accurately reflect this phenomenon.

Pazopanib (PAZ) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is approved for the treatment of non-adipocytic advanced soft tissue sarcoma. The activity of this agent has not yet been properly explored in preclinical liposarcoma models nor in a randomized phase \u0428 clinical trial in this entity. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PAZ had antitumor activity in DDLPS models in vivo. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We established two patient-derived DDLPS xenograft models (UZLX-STS3 and UZLX-STS5) through implantation of tumor material from sarcoma patients in athymic nude NMRI mice. An animal model of the SW872 liposarcoma cell line was also used. To investigate the efficacy of PAZ in vivo, mice bearing tumors were treated for 2 weeks with sterile water, doxorubicin (1.2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally, twice per week), PAZ [40 mg/kg, orally (p.o.), twice per day], or PAZ plus doxorubicin (same schedules as for single treatments). RESULTS: Patient-derived xenografts retained the histologic and molecular features of DDLPS. PAZ significantly delayed tumor growth by decreasing proliferation and inhibited angiogenesis in all models tested. Combining the angiogenesis inhibitor with an anthracycline did not show superior efficacy. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that PAZ has potential antitumor activity in DDLPS primarily through antiangiogenic effects and therefore should be explored in clinical trials.",

     "abstract": "Several microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with the molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, previous studies analyzing the dysregulation of miRNAs in HCC show heterogeneous results. We hypothesized that part of this heterogeneity might be attributable to variations of miRNA expression deriving from the HCC capsule or the fibrotic septa within the peritumoral tissue used as controls. Tissue from surgically resected hepatitis C\u2013associated HCC from six well-matched patients was microdissected using laser microdissection and pressure catapulting technique. Four distinct histologic compartments were isolated: tumor parenchyma (TP), fibrous capsule of the tumor (TC), tumor-adjacent liver parenchyma (LP), and cirrhotic septa of the tumor-adjacent liver (LC). MiRNA expression profiling analysis of 1105 mature miRNAs and precursors was performed using miRNA microarray. Principal component analysis and consecutive pairwise supervised comparisons demonstrated distinct patterns of expressed miRNAs not only for TP versus LP (e.g., intratumoral down-regulation of miR-214, miR-199a, miR-146a, and miR-125a; P< .05) but also for TC versus LC (including down-regulation within TC of miR-126, miR-99a/100, miR-26a, and miR-125b; P< .05). The tumor capsule therefore demonstrates a tumor-like phenotype with down-regulation of well-known tumor-suppressive miRNAs. Variations of co-analyzed fibrotic tissue within the tumor or in controls may have profound influence on miRNA expression analyses in HCC. Several miRNAs, which are proposed to be HCC specific, may indeed be rather associated to the tumor capsule. As miRNAs evolve to be important biomarkers in liver tumors, the presented data have important translational implications on diagnostics and treatment in patients with HCC.",

This is complicated by the fact that the materials often available are routinely collected formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples in which the mRNA is known to be highly degraded. The purpose of this study was to investigate 22 potential reference genes in sarcoma FFPE samples and to study the variation in expression level within different samples taken from the same tumor and between different histologic types. Methods: Twenty-nine patients treated for sarcoma were enrolled. The samples encompassed 82 (FFPE) specimens. Extraction of total RNA from 7-\u03bcm FFPE sections was performed using a fully automated, bead-base RNA isolation procedure, and 22 potential reference genes were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The stability of the genes was analyzed by RealTime Statminer. The intrasamples variation and the interclass correlation coefficients were calculated. The linear regression model was used to calculate the degradation of the mRNA over time. Results: The quality of RNA was sufficient for analysis in 84% of the samples. Recommended reference genes differed with histologic types. However, PPIA, SF3A1, and MRPL19 were stably expressed regardless of the histologic type included. The variation in \u2206Cq value for samples from the same patients was similar to the variation between patients. It was possible to compensate for the time-dependent degradation of the mRNA when normalization was made using the selected reference genes. Conclusion: PPIA, SF3A1, and MRPL19 are suitable reference genes for normalization in gene expression studies of FFPE samples from sarcoma regardless of the histology.",

     "abstract": "Aim: Attempts have been made to use CTC values for interpretation of treatment response and to guide change of chemotherapy by using a static cut-off of 5 CTC to stratify patients in favourable or unfavourable responders. We propose a new approach to interpret treatment effect using significant changes in CTC values (SCV-limits1) as grouping parameter for responders and non-responders to chemotherapy among metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients. Method: CTC were analysed using the CellSearch System in blood from 47 mBC patients before the start of new chemotherapy and before the third cycle of therapy. The new and old approach to interpret changes in CTC values were compared in relation to progression free survival (PFS). Results: The new approach using significant CTC change (P = .032) and the old approach using static cut-off (P > .001) correlated significantly with PFS using a cohort of 47 patients. Conclusion: We propose a new approach to interpret significant changes between baseline and follow-up CTC values as a tool for assessing treatment effect in mBC. Our approach stratified patients in new risk groups that were stratified significantly with respect to PFS. More patients are needed to balance the size of the risk groups for better comparison to the existing approach based on a 5 CTC cut-off.",

     "abstract": "Acquiring therapy resistance is one of the major obstacles in the treatment of patients with cancer. The discovery of the cancer stem cell (CSC)\u2013specific drug salinomycin raised hope for improved treatment options by targeting therapy-refractory CSCs and mesenchymal cancer cells. However, the occurrence of an acquired salinomycin resistance in tumor cells remains elusive. To study the formation of salinomycin resistance, mesenchymal breast cancer cells were sequentially treated with salinomycin in an in vitro cell culture assay, and the resulting differences in gene expression and salinomycin susceptibility were analyzed. We demonstrated that long-term salinomycin treatment of mesenchymal cancer cells resulted in salinomycin-resistant cells with elevated levels of epithelial markers, such as E-cadherin and miR-200c, a decreased migratory capability, and a higher susceptibility to the classic chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. The formation of salinomycin resistance through the acquisition of epithelial traits was further validated by inducing mesenchymal-epithelial transition through an overexpression of miR-200c. The transition from a mesenchymal to a more epithelial-like phenotype of salinomycin-treated tumor cells was moreover confirmed in vivo, using syngeneic and, for the first time, transgenic mouse tumor models. These results suggest that the acquisition of salinomycin resistance through the clonal selection of epithelial-like cancer cells could become exploited for improved cancer therapies by antagonizing the tumor-progressive effects of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.",

However, its biological and genetic characteristics are largely unknown. We investigated the clinicopathological and molecular features of 34 GBMOs and compared the survival rate of these patients with those of patients with astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (AOA), and conventional GBMs in our hospital. GBMO could be divided into two groups based on the presence of an IDH1 mutation. The IDH1 mutation was more frequently found in secondary GBMO, which had lower frequencies of EGFR amplification but higher MGMT methylation than the wild type IDH1 group, and patients with mutant IDH1 GBMO were on average younger than those with wild-type IDH1. Therefore, GBMO is a clinically and molecularly heterogeneous subtype, largely belonging to a proneural and classical subtype of GBM. The survival rate of GBMO patients itself was worse than that of AOA patients but not significantly better than that of conventional GBM patients. GBMO survival was independent of the dominant histopathological subtype i.e., astrocyte-dominant or oligodendroglioma -dominant, but it was significantly associated with the IDH1 mutation and MGMT methylation status. Therefore, GBMO should be regarded as a separate entity from AOA and must be classified as a subtype of GBM. However, further study is needed to determine whether it is a pathologic variant or a pattern of GBM because GBMO has a similar prognosis to conventional GBMs.",

Previous studies showed that CTC counts could be regarded as an indicator in tumor diagnosis, predicting clinical outcomes and monitoring treatment responses. In this report, we utilize our facile and efficient CTC detection device made of hydroxyapatite/chitosan (HA/CTS) for rare cancer cells isolation and enumeration in clinical use. A biocompatible and surface roughness controllable nanofilm was deposited onto a glass slide to achieve enhanced topographic interactions with nanoscale cellular surface components, anti-EpCAM (epithelial cell adhesion molecule, EpCAM) were then coated onto the surface of nanosubstrate for specific capture of CTCs. This device performed a considerable and stable capture yields. We evaluated the relationship performance between serial CTC changes and the changes of tumor volume/serum tumor marker in gastrointestinal cancer patients undergoing anti-cancer treatments. The present study results showed that changes in the number of CTC were associated with tumor burden and progression. Enumeration of CTCs in cancer patients may predict clinical response. Longitudinal monitoring of individual patients during the therapeutic process showed a close correlation between CTC quantity and clinical response to anti-cancer therapy. Effectively capture of this device is capable of CTCs isolation and quantification for monitoring of cancer and predicting treatment response.",

RNA sequencing previously revealed that there was a group of six large CFS genes which frequently had decreased expression in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) and real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction experiments validated that these six large CFS genes (PARK2, DLG2, NBEA, CTNNA3, DMD, and FHIT) had decreased expression in most of the tumor samples. In this study, we investigated whether the decreased expression of these genes has any clinical significance in OPSCCs. We analyzed the six CFS large genes in 45 OPSCC patients and found that 27 (60%) of the OPSCC tumors had decreased expression of these six genes. When we correlated the expression of these six genes to each patient\u2019s clinical records, for 11 patients who had tumor recurrence, 10 of them had decreased expression of almost all 6 genes. When we divided the patients into two groups, one group with decreased expression of the six genes and the other group with either slight changes or increased expression of the six genes, we found that there is significant difference in the incidence of tumor recurrence between these two groups by Kaplan-Meier plot analysis (P < .05). Our results demonstrated that those OPSCC tumors with decreased expression of this select group of six large CFS genes were much more likely to be associated with tumor recurrence and these genes are potential prognostic markers for predicting tumor recurrence in OPSCC.",

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is frequently detected in tumor tissue from patients with different cancers. Here, we aimed to determine the prevalence and potential prognostic role of HCMV in BMs. METHODS: We obtained archived samples of BMs from 41 patients with breast cancer and 37 with colorectal cancer and paired primary tumor tissues from 13 and 12 patients in each respective group. In addition, primary breast cancer tissues from 15 patients were included. HCMV proteins were detected with an immunohistochemical technique and Western blot. HCMV nucleic acids were detected with TaqMan polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: HCMV proteins were abundantly expressed in 99% of BM specimens, and in 12 of 13 (92%) paired primary breast cancer specimens. All 12 paired colon cancer samples were positive for HCMV proteins. Protein staining was mainly confined to neoplastic cells. Western blot analysis detected an HCMV-IE reactive protein in 53% of breast cancer specimens, and PCR detected the presence of HCMV DNA and transcripts in 92% and 80% of samples, respectively. Patients with high-level expression of HCMV-IE proteins in their tumors had a shorter time to tumor progression and shorter overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of HCMV proteins and nucleic acids is very high in primary and metastatic tumors and may drive the development of metastatic brain tumors; therefore, this virus may represent a potential therapeutic target in metastatic cancer.",

     "abstract": "Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a hematological malignancy with unfavorable prognosis. Novel therapeutic approaches for treating the disease are aimed at the mechanisms regulating growth signals, cellular proliferation, and survival pathways of the malignant clones. Bortezomib (Brt), a proteasome inhibitor with pleiotropic activities was shown to be active in MCL and is currently implemented in therapeutic combinations for this disease. Telomerase activity is essential for survival of malignant cells and as such is considered a valid therapeutic target. This study evaluated the effects of bortezomib on telomerase activity and its regulation in MCL cells in vitro and ex vivo.Our study shows that bortezomib exerts a cytotoxic effect in a dose dependent manner in two MCL cell lines, with differential sensitivity. While the IC50 for HBL-2 cells ranged between 2.5 ng/ml to 1.5 ng/ml during 24-72 h respectively, the IC50 for the NCEB cells was twice. Bortezomib differentially inhibited telomerase activity (TA): in HBL-2 cells there was a decline of 20%-55% during 24-72 h respectively. However in NCEB cells the decline was much smaller, and did not exceed 25%. Inhibition of telomerase activity is shown to be operated by two separate mechanisms: reduction of the hTERT mRNA expression (controlled by the binding of transcription factors) and reduction in phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of hTERT by its kinases, AKT and PKC\u03b1.A decrease in telomerase activity was demonstrated also in mononuclear cells, isolated from three MCL patients following incubation of the cells in the presence of bortezomib for 24-72 h. In one patient the decrease in TA ranged between 17%-37% respectively, in the second patient between 63%-76% and in the third patient between 70-100% for 24-72 h respectively.The current study indicates that a combination of bortezomib and rapamycin, (an m-Tor pathway inhibitor used in MCL treatment) induced synergistic inhibition of telomerase activity. In HBL-2 cells, the combined treatment of bortezomib and rapamycin decreased TA by 80% compared to the expected value (40%) and for NCEB cells a similar trend was observed. In contrast, there was neither additive nor synergistic effect of this combination on cell proliferation.In the light of the crucial role of telomerase in cancer cells, it was important to characterize the possible relations between telomerase and bortezomib and to distinguish the biochemical mechanisms of its regulation and its interactions with other signal transduction inhibitors such as rapamycin. The results of this work encourage the in vivo examination of the therapeutic potential of the combination of bortezomib and rapamycin in Mantle Cell Lymphoma patients.",

     "abstract": "The standard of care for glioblastoma (GB) is surgery followed by concurrent radiation therapy (RT) and temozolomide (TMZ) and then adjuvant TMZ. This regime is associated with increased survival but also increased occurrence of equivocal imaging findings, e.g., tumor progression (TP) versus treatment effect (TE), which is also referred to as pseudoprogression (PsP). Equivocal findings make decisions regarding further treatment difficult and often delayed. Because none of the current imaging assays have proven sensitive and specific for differentiation of TP versus TE/PsP, we investigated whether blood-derived microvesicles (MVs) would be a relevant assay. METHODS: 2.8 ml of citrated blood was collected from patients with GB at the time of their RT simulation, at the end of chemoradiation therapy (CRT), and multiple times following treatment. MVs were collected following multiple centrifugations (300g, 2500g, and 15,000g). The pellet from the final spin was analyzed using flow cytometry. A diameter of approximately 300 nm or greater and Pacific Blue\u2013labeled Annexin V positivity were used to identify the MVs reported herein. RESULTS: We analyzed 19 blood samples from 11 patients with GB. MV counts in the patients with stable disease or TE/PsP were significantly lower than patients who developed TP (P = .014). CONCLUSION: These preliminary data suggest that blood analysis for MVs from GB patients receiving CRT may be useful to distinguish TE/PsP from TP. MVs may add clarity to standard imaging for decision making in patients with equivocal imaging findings.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: The identification of tumor pathologic characteristics is an important part of breast cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment planning but currently requires biopsy as its standard. Here, we investigated a noninvasive quantitative ultrasound method for the characterization of breast tumors in terms of their histologic grade, which can be used with clinical diagnostic ultrasound data. METHODS: Tumors of 57 locally advanced breast cancer patients were analyzed as part of this study. Seven quantitative ultrasound parameters were determined from each tumor region from the radiofrequency data, including mid-band fit, spectral slope, 0-MHz intercept, scatterer spacing, attenuation coefficient estimate, average scatterer diameter, and average acoustic concentration. Parametric maps were generated corresponding to the region of interest, from which four textural features, including contrast, energy, homogeneity, and correlation, were determined as further tumor characterization parameters. Data were examined on the basis of tumor subtypes based on histologic grade (grade I versus grade II to III). RESULTS: Linear discriminant analysis of the means of the parametric maps resulted in classification accuracy of 79%. On the other hand, the linear combination of the texture features of the parametric maps resulted in classification accuracy of 82%. Finally, when both the means and textures of the parametric maps were combined, the best classification accuracy was obtained (86%). CONCLUSIONS: Textural characteristics of quantitative ultrasound spectral parametric maps provided discriminant information about different types of breast tumors. The use of texture features significantly improved the results of ultrasonic tumor characterization compared to conventional mean values. Thus, this study suggests that texture-based quantitative ultrasound analysis of in vivo breast tumors can provide complementary diagnostic information about tumor histologic characteristics.",

Athymic mice (N = 33) were subcutaneously implanted with trastuzumab-sensitive (BT474) or trastuzumab-resistant (HR6) breast cancer cells. Tumor-bearing animals were distributed into four groups: BT474 treated and control, HR6 treated and control. DW- and DCE-MRI were conducted at baseline, day 1, and day 4; trastuzumab (10 mg/kg) or saline was administered at baseline and day 3. Animals were sacrificed on day 4 and tumors resected for histology. Voxel-based DW- and DCE-MRI analyses were performed to generate parametric maps of ADC, Ktrans, and ve. On day 1, no differences in tumor size were observed between any of the groups. On day 4, significant differences in tumor size were observed between treated vs. control BT474, treated BT474 vs. treated HR6, and treated vs. control HR6 (P < .0001). On day 1, ve was significantly higher in the BT474 treated group compared to BT474 control (P = .002) and HR6 treated (P = .004). On day 4, ve and Ktrans were significantly higher in the treated BT474 tumors compared to BT474 controls (P = .0007, P = .02, respectively). A significant decrease in Ki67 staining reinforced response in the BT474 treated group compared to BT474 controls (P = .02).

Gene expression analysis may complement traditional diagnostic methods. We searched gene expression patterns in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and in our tumor and normal samples. The biologic and prognostic potential of the identified genes was analyzed. The GEO data set of primary xenografted ACCs revealed that expression of five genes, engrailed homeobox 1 (EN1), fatty acid binding protein 7 (FABP7), hemoglobin epsilon 1, MYB, and versican (VCAN), was dramatically increased. mRNA expression of EN1, FABP7, MYB, and VCAN distinguished our sporadic ACCs from normal tissues and benign tumors. FABP7 expression appeared to be regulated differently from EN1 and MYB and was crossly correlated with poor prognosis in our ACC cohort. Immunohistochemistry showed that FABP7 protein was predominantly expressed in the nucleus of myoepithelial cells of both tubular and cribriform subtypes. In contrast, in the solid subtype, which is often associated with a lower survival rate, FABP7 protein was uniformly expressed in cancerous cells. One case with cribriform architecture and the highest level of FABP7 mRNA showed strong FABP7 staining in both duct-type epithelial and myoepithelial cells, suggesting that diffuse expression of FABP7 protein might be related to aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. We propose FABP7 as a novel biomarker in ACC. The molecule may be useful in diagnosis and for identifying more effective therapies targeting this protein or upstream molecules that regulate it.",

METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-six NSCLC adenocarcinoma specimens were collected, and highly sensitive amplification refractory mutation system method was implemented for EGFR mutation detection, with clinicopathologic characteristics involved in the final analysis. RESULTS: In the total of 276 samples, 96% (265/276) of tumors obtained evaluable EGFR mutation status, the frequency of mutation was 55.8% (148/265) in all specimens, and three different type samples shared a comparable successful testing rate: 97.4% (38/39) in surgical tumor tissues, 100% (108/108) in lymph node biopsy samples, and 92.2% (119/129) in cytological samples. EGFR mutation was significantly associated with sex, smoking history, lymph node metastasis status (N stage), primary tumor size, testing tissues origin, and sample type (P < .05). Multivariate analysis reconfirmed that smoking history and primary tumor size shared significant correlation with EGFR mutation after adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: Both lymph node biopsy and cytological samples were suitable surrogates for EGFR mutation detection in NSCLC compared with tumor tissues, gene status should be detected widely considering the high EGFR mutation rate, and nonsmoking history together with smaller primary tumor size was an independent indicator of EGFR mutation status.",

Sine oculis homeobox 2 (SIX2) is a transcription factor expressed specifically in the CM, provides a critical mechanism for CM self-renewal, and remains persistently active in WT blastema, although its purpose in this childhood malignancy remains unclear. We hypothesized that SIX2, analogous to its function in development, confers a survival pathway to blastema, the putative WT stem cell. To test its functional significance in WT biology, wild-type SIX2 was overexpressed in the human WT cell line, WiT49. After validating this model, SIX2 effects on anchorage-independent growth, proliferation, invasiveness, canonical WNT pathway signaling, and gene expression of specific WNT pathway participants were evaluated. Relative to controls, WiT49 cells overexpressing SIX2 showed significantly enhanced anchorage-independent growth and early-passage proliferation representing surrogates of cell survival. Interestingly, overexpression of SIX2 generally repressed TCF/LEF-dependent canonical WNT signaling, which activates and coordinates both differentiation and stem pathways, but significantly heightened canonical WNT signaling through the survivin promoter, a mechanism that exclusively maintains the stem state. In summary, when overexpressed in a human WT cell line, SIX2 enhances cell survival and appears to shift the balance in WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling away from a differentiation path and toward a stem cell survival path.",

An important challenge in treatment of NMIBC is both high recurrence and high progression rates. Consequently, more efficacious intravesical treatment regimes are in demand. Inhibition of the cell\u2019s DNA repair systems is a new promising strategy to improve cancer therapy, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a new promising target. PCNA is an essential scaffold protein in multiple cellular processes including DNA replication and repair. More than 200 proteins, many involved in stress responses, interact with PCNA through the AlkB homologue 2 PCNA-interacting motif (APIM), including several proteins directly or indirectly involved in repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs). In this study, we targeted PCNA with a novel peptide drug containing the APIM sequence, ATX-101, to inhibit repair of the DNA damage introduced by the chemotherapeutics. A bladder cancer cell panel and two different orthotopic models of bladder cancer in rats, the AY-27 implantation model and the dietary BBN induction model, were applied. ATX-101 increased the anticancer efficacy of the ICL-inducing drug mitomycin C (MMC), as well as bleomycin and gemcitabine in all bladder cancer cell lines tested. Furthermore, we found that ATX-101 given intravesically in combination with MMC penetrated the bladder wall and further reduced the tumor growth in both the slow growing endogenously induced and the rapidly growing transplanted tumors. These results suggest that ATX-101 has the potential to improve the efficacy of current MMC treatment in NMIBC.",

Thus formed PST-Dox nanoparticles induced apoptosis and exhibited significant cytotoxicity in murine ascites cell lines, Dalton\u2019s lymphoma ascites and Ehrlich\u2019s ascites carcinoma. The mechanism contributing to the augmented cytotoxicity of nanoconjugates at lower doses was validated by measuring the Dox intracellular uptake in human colon, leukemic and breast cancer cell lines. PST-Dox nanoparticles showed rapid internalization of Dox into cancer cells within a short period of incubation. Further, in vivo efficacy was tested in comparison to the parent counterparts - PST001 and Dox, in ascites and solid tumor syngraft mice models. Treatment of ascites tumors with PST-Dox nanoparticles significantly reduced the tumor volume, viable tumor cell count, and increased survival and percentage life span in the early, established and prophylactic phases of the disease. Administration of nanoparticles through intratumoral route delivered more robust antitumor response than the intraperitoneal route in solid malignancies.

Because stem cell factor (SCF) is c-Kit's sole ligand, we analyzed its expression in the tumor cells and their environment. Immunohistochemistry revealed its presence in c-Kit\u2013positive tumor cells, suggesting an activation of autocrine signaling. We observed a significant induction of ERK1/2 in the cells. SCF staining was also found in other types of non-cancerous cells adjacent to tumors within salivary glands, including stromal fibroblasts, neutrophils, peripheral nerve, skeletal muscle, vascular endothelial cells, mucous acinar cells, and intercalated ducts. Quantitative PCR showed that the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression distinguished ACCs from normal salivary tissues and was cross-correlated with short-term poor prognosis. Expression levels of SCF and c-Kit were highly correlated in the cases with perineural invasion. These observations suggest that c-Kit is potentially activated by receptor dimerization upon stimulation by SCF in ACC, and that the highest quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression could be a predictor of poor prognosis. Our findings may support an avenue for c-Kit-targeted therapy to improve disease control in ACC patients harboring the top quartile of c-Kit mRNA expression.",

     "abstract": "Metastatic disease still lacks effective treatments, and remains the primary cause of cancer mortality. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop better strategies to inhibit metastatic cancer. The Rho family GTPase Rac is an ideal target for anti-metastatic cancer therapy, because Rac is a key molecular switch that is activated by a myriad of cell surface receptors to promote cancer cell migration/invasion and survival. Previously, we reported the design and development of EHop-016, a small molecule compound, which inhibits Rac activity of metastatic cancer cells with an IC50 of 1\u00a0\u03bcM. EHop-016 also inhibits the activity of the Rac downstream effector p21-activated kinase (PAK), lamellipodia extension, and cell migration in metastatic cancer cells. Herein, we tested the efficacy of EHop-016 in a nude mouse model of experimental metastasis, where EHop-016 administration at 25\u00a0mg/kg body weight (BW) significantly reduced mammary fat pad tumor growth, metastasis, and angiogenesis. As quantified by UPLC MS/MS, EHop-016 was detectable in the plasma of nude mice at 17 to 23\u00a0ng/ml levels at 12\u00a0h following intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of 10 to 25\u00a0mg/kg BW EHop-016. The EHop-016 mediated inhibition of angiogenesis In Vivo was confirmed by immunohistochemistry of excised tumors and by In Vitro tube formation assays of endothelial cells. Moreover, EHop-016 affected cell viability by down-regulating Akt and Jun kinase activities and c-Myc and Cyclin D expression, as well as increasing caspase 3/7 activities in metastatic cancer cells. In conclusion, EHop-016 has potential as an anticancer compound to block cancer progression via multiple Rac-directed mechanisms.",

However, clinical use of proteasome inhibitors is limited by the development of resistance or severe side effects. In our study we characterized the anti-tumor properties of the novel proteasome inhibitor BSc2118. The sensitivity of tumor lines to BSc2118 was analyzed in comparison to bortezomib using crystal violet staining in order to assess cell viability. The In Vivo distribution of BSc2118 in mouse tissues was tracked by a fluorescent-modified form of BSc2118 (BSc2118-FL) and visualized by confocal microscopy. Inhibition of the 20S proteasome was monitored both in cultured cell lines and in mice, respectively. Finally, safety and efficacy of BSc2118 was evaluated in a mouse melanoma model. BSc2118 inhibits proliferation of different tumor cell lines with a similar potency as compared with bortezomib. Systemic administration of BSc2118 in mice is well tolerated, even when given in a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight. After systemic injection of BSc2118 or bortezomib similar proteasome inhibition patterns are observed within the murine organs. Detection of BSc2118-FL revealed correlation of distribution pattern of BSc2118 with inhibition of proteasomal activity in cells or mouse tissues. Finally, administration of BSc2118 in a mouse melanoma model shows significant local anti-tumor effects. Concluding, BSc2118 represents a novel low-toxic agent that might be alternatively used for known proteasome inhibitors in anti-cancer treatment.",

In mice inoculated intraperitoneally with SKOV3ip1 cells expressing WT1 \u2212\u00a017AA/\u2212\u00a0KTS, disseminated tumor weights and production of ascites were significantly increased compared with those in mice inoculated with cells expressing the control vector.

Immunoblot analysis revealed that WT1 \u2212\u00a017AA/\u2212\u00a0KTS significantly increased the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) compared with the control. Greater numbers of CD31-immunopositive vessels were observed in tumors from mice injected with cells expressing WT1 \u2212\u00a017AA/\u2212\u00a0KTS than in tumors from control mice.

PANC-1, CFPAC-1, and Caco-2 cells were intrinsically resistant to 17-AAG but sensitive to NVP-AUY922. Other cellular models were sensitive to both inhibitors. Human epidermal growth factor receptor receptors and their downstream signaling pathways were downregulated in susceptible cellular models, and concurrently, Hsp70 was induced. Intrinsic resistance to 17-AAG did not correlate with expression of ATP-binding cassette transporters involved in multidrug resistance. Some 17-AAG-resistant, NVP-AUY922\u2013sensitive cell lines lacked NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme and activity. However, colorectal LoVo cells still responded to both drugs in spite of having undetectable levels and activity of NQO1. Pharmacological and biologic inhibition of NQO1 did not confer resistance to 17-AAG in sensitive cell lines. Therefore, even though 17-AAG sensitivity is related to NQO1 protein levels and enzymatic activity, the absence of NQO1 does not necessarily convey resistance to 17-AAG in these cellular models. Moreover, NVP-AUY922 does not require NQO1 for its action and is a more potent inhibitor than 17-AAG in these cells. More importantly, we show in this report that NVP-AUY922 potentiates the inhibitory effects of chemotherapeutic agents, such as gemcitabine or oxaliplatin, and other drugs that are currently being evaluated in clinical trials as antitumor agents.",

MET copy gain (set as more than 3.0 copies per cell) was found in 18.5% of the samples and occurred more frequently in the adenocarcinomas (ADCs) with an increased epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) CN (P = .001 and .030 for EGFR and HER2, respectively) and in the ADCs with EGFR activating mutations (P = .051) but did not correlate with KRAS dosage or mutational status. MET mRNA level was 1.76-fold higher [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29-2.40] in the tumor compared to unaffected lung tissue and associated significantly with MET CN (beta coefficient, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.22-1.87; P < .001). In the multivariable analysis, patients diagnosed with ADC with increased MET CN had a significantly higher risk of disease recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.20-2.57; P = .004). An increased MET CN in combination with histologic type appears to be a prognostic factor in patients with ADC after a curative surgery.",

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 2001 and March 2013, a total of 214 patients with metastatic GIST was treated at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. Among them, 55 (11.6%) patients who received sunitinib were investigated. One group of patients was administered with standard dose of once-daily sunitinib (standard dose group) and the other group was administered with standard total daily dose of sunitinib in fractioned doses (fractioned dose group). RESULTS: Thirty-two male and 23 female patients with a median age of 55 years received sunitinib. The median duration of sunitinib administration was 9.2 months. The clinical benefit was 65.2%. The mean peak blood level of sunitinib in patients with fractioned doses was significantly lower than that in those with once-daily dose (83.4 vs 50.1 ng/ml, P = .01). The rates of adverse effects of hand-foot syndrome, mucositis, and yellow skin were significantly decreased by fractioned doses of sunitinib. However, the progression-free and overall survival did not differ between patients with different treatment regimens. CONCLUSION: The fractioned dose regimen of sunitinib appears to be a safe and effective treatment for patients with IM-resistant/intolerant GISTs. Significantly decreased toxicity of this regimen could be explained by significantly lower peak sunitinib blood level. However, the treatment efficacy is not reduced by this regimen.",

In this study, therefore, both prognostic values of Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) and combination of platelet count and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (COP-NLR) in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were investigated and compared. METHODS: This retrospective study included 375 patients who underwent esophagectomy for ESCC. The cancer-specific survival (CSS) was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the difference was assessed by the log-rank test. The GPS was calculated as follows: patients with elevated C-reactive protein (>\u00a010 mg/l) and hypoalbuminemia (<\u00a035 g/l) were assigned to GPS2. Patients with one or no abnormal value were assigned to GPS1 or GPS0, respectively. The COP-NLR was calculated as follows: patients with elevated platelet count (>\u00a0300 \u00d7 109/l) and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (>\u00a03) were assigned to COP-NLR2. Patients with one or no abnormal value were assigned to COP-NLR1 or COP-NLR0, respectively. RESULTS: The 5-year CSS in patients with GPS0, 1, and 2 was 50.0%, 27.0%, and 12.5%, respectively (P < .001). The 5-year CSS in patients with COP-NLR0, 1, and 2 was 51.8%, 27.0%, and 11.6%, respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis showed that both GPS (P = .003) and COP-NLR (P = .003) were significant predictors in such patients. In addition, our study demonstrated a similar hazard ratio (HR) between COP-NLR and GPS (HR = 1.394 vs HR = 1.367). CONCLUSIONS: COP-NLR is an independent predictive factor in patients with ESCC. We conclude that COP-NLR predicts survival in ESCC similar to GPS.",

No association between LAPTM4B genotypes and gender, age, subtype, Clark level of invasion, Breslow thickness, ulceration, clinical stage, and C-KIT, BRAF gene mutation status was observed. LAPTM4B*2 is associated with the high risk of malignant melanoma and carrying LAPTM4B *2 may be a susceptible factor to Chinese melanoma patients.",

METHODS: We performed a prospective pilot study of dMRI in patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Patients underwent dMRI prior to neoadjuvant chemoradiation. Surgical specimens were graded according to the percent tumor cell destruction. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were used to generate whole-tumor derived ADC histogram distributions and mean ADC values. The primary objective of the study was to correlate ADC parameters with pathologic and CT response. RESULTS: Ten of the 12 patients enrolled on the study completed chemoradiation and had surgery. Three were found to be unresectable at the time of surgery and no specimen was obtained. Out of the 7 patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, 3 had a grade III histopathologic response (>\u00a090% tumor cell destruction), 2 had a grade IIB response (51% to 90% tumor cell destruction), 1 had a grade IIA response (11% to 50% tumor cell destruction), and 1 had a grade I response (>\u00a090% viable tumor). Median survival for patients with a grade III response, grade I-II response, and unresectable disease were 25.6, 18.7, and 6.1\u00a0months, respectively. There was a significant correlation between pre-treatment mean tumor ADC values and the amount of tumor cell destruction after chemoradiation with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.94 (P = .001). Mean pre-treatment ADC was 161 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0mm2/s (n = 3) in responding patients (>\u00a090% tumor cell destruction) compared to 125 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a05\u00a0mm2/s (n = 4) in non-responding patients (>\u00a010% viable tumor). CT imaging showed no significant change in tumor size in responders or non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: dMRI may be useful to predict response to chemoradiation in pancreatic cancer. In our study, tumors with a low ADC mean value at baseline responded poorly to standard chemoradiation and would be candidates for intensified therapy.",

RESULTS: Gene expression profiling studies conducted between MVHP and SSA/P identified CLDN1 as the most statistically significant differentially expressed gene (p<0.05). Validation with qRT-PCR confirmed an up-regulation of CLDN1 in BRAF V600E mutant polyps regardless of polyp type (p<0.0005). Immunohistochemical analysis of CLDN1 expression in BRAF V600E mutant SSA/Ps (n=53) and MVHPs (n=111) and BRAF wild-type MVHPs (n=58), demonstrated a strong correlation between CLDN1 expression and the BRAF V600E mutation in both SSA/P and MVHP samples when compared to wild-type polyps (p<0.0001). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates an up regulation of CLDN1 protein in serrated colorectal polyps including MVHP harbouring the BRAF V600E mutation. Our results demonstrated an apparent heterogeneity on the molecular level within the MVHP group and suggest that MVHP with somatic BRAF V600E mutation and up-regulated expression of CLDN1 are closely related to SSA/P and may in fact represent a continuous spectrum of the same neoplastic process within the serrated pathway of colorectal carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Screening programs are recommended for individuals at risk (IAR) from families with familial pancreatic cancer (FPC). However, reliable imaging methods or biomarkers for early diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC) or its precursor lesions are still lacking. The ability of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) to discriminate multifocal high-grade precursor lesions or PC from normal was examined. The presence of miRNA-21, -155, -196a, -196b and -210 was analyzed in the serum of transgenic KPC mice to test their ability to distinguish mice with different grades of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPanIN1\u20133) or PC from control mice. Serum levels of miR-196a and -196b were significantly higher in mice with PanIN2/3 lesions (n = 10) or PC (n = 8) as compared to control mice (n = 10) or mice with PanIN1 lesions (n = 10; P = .01). In humans, miR-196a and -196b were also diagnostic. Patients with PC, sporadic (n = 9) or hereditary (n = 10), and IAR with multifocal PanIN2/3 lesions (n = 5) had significantly higher serum levels than patients with neuroendocrine pancreatic tumors (n = 10) or chronic pancreatitis (n = 10), IAR with PanIN1 or no PanIN lesions (n = 5), and healthy controls (n = 10). The combination of both miR-196a and -196b reached a sensitivity of 1 and specificity of 0.9 (area under the curve = 0.99) to diagnose PC or high-grade PanIN lesions. In addition, preoperative elevated serum levels of miR-196a and -196b in patients with PC or multifocal PanIN2/3 lesions dropped to normal after potential curative resection. The combination of miR-196a and -196b may be a promising biomarker test for the screening of IAR for FPC.",

In the current study, we examined clonogenic survival, DNA damage, and cell cycle distribution in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines treated with LDR in combination with varying doses and schedules of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), gemcitabine, and sorafenib. Radiosensitization was seen with 1 to 3 \u03bcM 5-FU (enhancement ratio 2.2\u201313.9) and 30 to 100 nM gemcitabine (enhancement ratio 1.9\u20132.9) administered 24 hours before LDR (0.26 Gy/h to 4.2 Gy). Sorafenib radiosensitized only at high concentrations (3\u201310 \u03bcM) when administered after LDR. For a given radiation dose, greater enhancement was seen with LDR compared to standard dose rate therapy. Summarizing our clinical experience with low dose rate radiosensitization, 13 patients (5 with HCC, 8 with liver metastases) were treated a total of 16 times with TARE and concurrent gemcitabine. Six partial responses and one complete response were observed with a median time to local failure of 7.1 months for all patients and 9.9 months for patients with HCC. In summary, HCC is sensitized to LDR with clinically achievable concentrations of gemcitabine and 5-FU in vitro. Encouraging responses were seen in a small cohort of patients treated with TARE and concurrent gemcitabine. Future studies are needed to validate the safety and efficacy of this approach.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Once-weekly gemcitabine concurrent with radiotherapy was highly effective in the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC) but limited by high mucosal toxicity. Pre-clinical investigations suggested that delivering gemcitabine at substantially lower doses twice weekly during radiotherapy improved the therapeutic ratio. We sought to translated these preclinical findings to a phase I trial. METHODS: Twenty-five patients with non-resectable HNC were scheduled to receive gemcitabine twice weekly during the last 2 weeks (total 5 infusions) of hyperfractionated radiotherapy delivering 1.2 Gy twice daily to total 76.8 Gy. Tumor biopsies to measure active intracellular (phosphorylated) gemcitabine were planned after the first drug delivery. Patients were assigned to escalating dose cohorts using the Continuous Reassessment Method. RESULTS: Twenty-one patients evaluable for toxicity were divided into cohorts receiving twice weekly treatment with 10, 20, 33, or 50 mg/m2 gemcitabine. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3-4 confluent mucositis/pharyngitis, and the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) was 20 mg/m2. Median survival was 20 months, with no difference between cohorts receiving lower (10, 20 mg/m2) or higher (33, 50 mg/m2) gemcitabine doses. Tumor biopsies after the first drug delivery showed only a minority of tumor cells in the specimens. CONCLUSION: These findings validate preclinical models that show that gemcitabine is radiation sensitizer at doses far below those used for systemic chemotherapy. However, the improvement in the therapeutic ratio predicted from the preclinical study did not translate into a substantial relative increase in the MTD of the drug in the clinical phase I trial.",

In this study, we have identified and characterized the infiltration of various inflammatory immune cells as well as inflammatory markers in Wilms tumor (WT), the most common renal malignancy in children. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks from tumors and autologous normal kidneys were immunostained for inflammatory immune cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and mast cells) and inflammatory markers such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1, phosphorylated STAT3, phosphorylated extracellular signal\u2013related kinases 1 and 2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, nitrotyrosine, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression. Overall, we found that there was predominant infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor stroma where COX-2 was robustly expressed. The other tumor-associated inflammatory markers were also mostly localized to tumor stroma. Hence, we speculate that COX-2\u2013mediated inflammatory microenvironment may be important in WT growth and potential therapies targeting this pathway may be beneficial and should be tested in clinical settings for the treatment of WTs in children.",

Clinicopathological data were compared using the Pearson chi-square test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the Cox proportional hazards model to test independent prognostic factors and calculate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Cytoplasmic FLI-1 expression positively correlated with N stage, distant metastasis and death (P<\u00a00.05) and also predicted poorer overall survival (OS) (P=\u00a00.014), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (P=\u00a00.010), progression-free survival (PFS) (P=\u00a00.031). In multivariate analysis, FLI-1 expression and clinical stage were both independent prognostic factors of poor OS and DMFS. Prognoses of patients in the training set, the testing set, and the entire set were clearly divided into four risk subgroups by supplementing FLI-1 with clinical stage. These results indicate that FLI-1 expression is an independent prognostic factor for NPC patients and suggest that supplementing FLI-1 with clinical stage could be helpful for more accurate risk definition.",

METHODS: The study was designed as a matched-pair case-control investigation to minimize intergroup heterogeneity. Patients were stratified into gefitinib plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone groups with matching for sex, age, ECOG performance status, progress-free survival (PFS) from previous EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment, EGFR mutation types, and tumor metastasis status. RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were selected from our database using the matched-pair method. The median age was 61 years (95% confidence interval, 57-65 years). During a follow-up period of 14.5 months on average, the overall response rates of the gefitinib-integrated and chemotherapy alone groups were 9.1% and 6.5%, respectively (P > .05), whereas the corresponding disease-control rates were 39.4% and 30.3%, respectively (P > .05). No statistically significant differences in PFS (median, 4.2 vs 3.3 months; P = .06) and overall survival (median, 10.4 vs 7.9 months; P = .44) were observed between two groups. The 6-month survival rates of the gefitinib-integrated and chemotherapy alone groups were 21.2% and 12.1%, respectively (P < .05). Side effects were mild, and all treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that gefitinib-integrated therapy offered a trend to better PFS and an improved 6-month survival rate in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinoma.

     "abstract": "Radiotherapy (XRT) delivered with the antibody cetuximab is a standard treatment option for squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck (SCCNH). Cetuximab acts by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to inhibit cancer progression. However, a significant percentage of patients will not respond to XRT and cetuximab. Statins reduce the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoid derivates that may be required for efficient EGFR signaling. We assessed whether the statin simvastatin could improve this combined therapy. In vitro, simvastatin enhanced the effects of XRT alone and in combination with cetuximab in wound healing, cell proliferation, and clonogenic assays in FaDu cells. These results were reflected in xenoimplanted tumors growing into subcutaneous tissue of athymic mice where concomitant treatment with simvastatin decreased tumor growth. Consistently, lower levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinases 1 and 2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT\u2013protein kinase B, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 oncoproteins and higher levels of caspase-3 and apoptosis in cell cultures and xenografts were observed.

METHODS: Xenografts were imaged in vivo, and tumor sections were stained for hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (Hif-1\u03b1), carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), and glucose transporter 1 (Glut-1). Tracer uptakes and the expression of Hif-1\u03b1 were determined in cell lines under 1% hypoxia. RESULTS: High [18F]EF5 uptake was seen in xenografts expressing high levels of CA IX, Glut-1, and Hif-1\u03b1, whereas low [18F]EF5 uptake was detected in xenografts expressing low amounts of CA IX and Hif-1\u03b1. The uptake of [18F]EF5 between cell lines varied extensively under normoxic conditions. A clear correlation was found between the expression of Hif-1\u03b1 and the uptake of [18F]FDG during hypoxia. CONCLUSIONS: The UT-SCC cell lines studied differed with respect to their hypoxic phenotypes, and these variations were detectable with [18F]EF5. Acute hypoxia increases [18F]FDG uptake in vitro, whereas a high [18F]EF5 uptake reflects a more complex phenotype associated with hypoxia and an aggressive growth pattern.",

     "abstract": "The bone microenvironment (BME) is the main hub of all skeletal related pathological events in osteosarcoma leading to tumor induced bone destruction, and decreasing overall bone quality and bone strength. The role of extra-cellular membrane vesicles (EMVs) as mediators of intercellular communication in modulating osteosarcoma-BME is unknown, and needs to be investigated. It is our hypothesis that osteosarcoma-EMVs contain pro-osteoclastogenic cargo which increases osteoclastic activity, and dysregulated bone remodeling in the osteosarcoma-BME. In this study, EMVs were isolated from the conditioned media of 143B and HOS human osteosarcoma cell cultures using differential ultracentrifugation. Nano-particle tracking analysis determined EMVs in the size range of 50-200 nm in diameter. The EMV yield from 143B cells was relatively higher compared to HOS cells. Transmission electron microscopy confirmed the ultrastructure of 143B-EMVs and detected multivesicular bodies. Biochemical characterization of 143B-EMVs detected the expression of bioactive pro-osteoclastic cargo including matrix metalloproteinases-1 and -13 (MMP-1, -13), transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), CD-9, and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u03b2 ligand (RANKL). Detection of a protein signature that is uniquely pro-osteoclastic in 143B-EMVs is a novel finding, and is significant as EMVs represent an interesting mechanism for potentially mediating bone destruction in the osteosarcoma-BME. This study further demonstrates that 143B cells actively mobilize calcium in the presence of ionomycin, and forskolin, and induce cytoskeleton rearrangements leading to vesicular biogenesis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that 143B osteosarcoma cells generate EMVs mainly by mechanisms involving increased intracellular calcium or cAMP levels, and contain pro-osteoclastic cargo.",

The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility and predictive utility of EGFR mutation detection in peripheral blood. METHODS: Plasma, serum and tumor tissue samples from 164 NSCLC patients were assessed for EGFR mutations using Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS). RESULTS: Compared with matched tumor tissue, the concordance rate of EGFR mutation status in plasma and serum was 73.6% and 66.3%, respectively. ARMS for EGFR mutation detection in blood showed low sensitivity (plasma, 48.2%; serum, 39.6%) but high specificity (plasma, 95.4%; serum, 95.5%). Treated with EGFR-TKIs, patients with EGFR mutations in blood had significantly higher objective response rate (ORR) and insignificantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) than those without mutations (ORR: plasma, 68.4% versus 38.9%, P = 0.037; serum, 75.0% versus 39.5%, P = 0.017; PFS: plasma, 7.9 months versus 6.1 months, P = 0.953; serum, 7.9 months versus 5.7 months, P = 0.889). In patients with mutant tumors, those without EGFR mutations in blood tended to have prolonged PFS than patients with mutations (19.7 months versus 11.0 months, P = 0.102). CONCLUSIONS: EGFR mutations detected in blood may be highly predictive of identical mutations in corresponding tumor, as well as showing correlations with tumor response and survival benefit from EGFR-TKIs. Therefore, blood for EGFR mutation detection may allow NSCLC patients with unavailable or insufficient tumor tissue the opportunity to benefit from personalized treatment. However, due to the high false negative rate in blood samples, analysis for EGFR mutations in tumor tissue remains the gold standard.",

Twenty females and nine males were enrolled, with a median age of 57 years and a median ECOG performance status of 0. Grade 1 lymphopenia and fatigue were the most common adverse effects. Three subjects withdrew for treatment-related toxicities occurring after the DLT observation period, including testicular edema, rash, and an increase in serum lipase accompanied by hyponatremia in one subject each. A true MTD of hydralazine in combination with therapeutic doses of valproic acid was not reached in this trial, and the planned upper limit of hydralazine investigated in this combination was 400 mg/day without grade 3 or 4 toxicities.

One partial response by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria was observed, and five subjects experienced stable disease for 3 to 6 months. The combination of hydralazine and valproic acid is simple, nontoxic, and might be appropriate for chemoprevention or combination with other cancer treatments.

Among the 50 EGFR wild type patients who detected fusion genes, 14 carried EML4-ALK fusion (28%), 2 had TPM3-ROS1 fusion (4%), and 3 harbored KIF5B-RET fusion (6%). No double fusions were found in one sample. Patients with fusion genes were younger than those without fusion genes (p = 0.032), but no significant difference was found in sex and smoking status (p > 0.05). In the thirty-five patients who received first-line chemotherapy, patients with fusion gene positive had disease control rate (DCR) (72.7% VS 50%, p > 0.05) and objective response rate (ORR) (9.1% VS 4.2%, p > 0.05) compared with those having fusion gene negative. The median progression free survival (mPFS) were 4.0 and 2.7 months in patients harbored fusion mutations and wild type, respectively (p > 0.05). We conclude that CB samples could be used to detect ALK, ROS1 and RET fusions in NSCLC. The frequency distribution of three fusion genes is higher in lung adenocarcinoma with wild-type EGFR, compared with unselected NSCLC patient population.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human ovarian carcinoma cells producing high (SKOV3ip1) or low (HeyA8) levels of VEGF were implanted into the peritoneal cavity of female nude mice. Seven days later, mice were randomized into four groups: control (vehicle), paclitaxel [5 mg/kg, weekly intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection], rhLK8 (50 mg/kg, daily i.p. injection), or the combination of paclitaxel and rhLK8. Mice were treated for 4 weeks and examined by necropsy. RESULTS: In mice implanted with SKOV3ip1 cells, rhLK8 treatment had no significant effect on tumor incidence or the volume of ascites but induced a significant decrease in tumor weight compared with control mice. Paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor weight and ascites volume, and combination treatment with paclitaxel and rhLK8 had an additive therapeutic effect. Similarly, in HeyA8 mice, the effect of combination treatment on tumor weight and tumor incidence was statistically significantly greater than that of paclitaxel or rhLK8 alone. Immunohistochemical analysis showed a significant decrease in microvessel density and a marked increase of apoptosis in tumor and tumor-associated endothelial cells in response to combination treatment with paclitaxel and rhLK8. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these results suggest that antiangiogenic therapy with rhLK8 in combination with taxane-based conventional chemotherapy could be effective for the treatment of ovarian carcinomas, regardless of VEGF status.",

Consequently, the purpose of this study was to determine the effects of fasting on delayed-type chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in dogs receiving doxorubicin. This prospective randomized crossover study involved intended administration of two doses of doxorubicin. Cancer-bearing dogs were randomized to be fasted for 24 hours beginning at 6 P.M. the night before the first or second doxorubicin administration, and all treatments were administered within an hour before or after 12 P.M. Dogs were fed normally before the alternate dose. Circulating IGF-1 concentrations were determined from serum samples obtained immediately before each doxorubicin treatment. Data from 35 doses were available from 20 dogs enrolled. Dogs that were fasted exhibited a significantly lower incidence of vomiting, when compared to fed dogs (10% compared to 67%, P = .020). Furthermore, among the 15 dogs that completed crossover dosing, vomiting was abrogated in four of five dogs that experienced doxorubicin-induced vomiting when fed normally (P = .050). No differences in other gastrointestinal, constitutional, or bone marrow toxicities or serum IGF-1 levels were observed.",

     "abstract": "Melanoma is the leading cause of death from skin cancer in industrialized countries. Several melanoma-related biomarkers and signaling pathways have been identified; however, their relevance to melanoma development/progression or to clinical outcome remains to be established. Aberrant activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway is implicated in various cancers including melanoma. We have previously demonstrated Rad6, an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, as an important mediator of \u03b2-catenin stability in breast cancer cells. Similar to breast cancer, \u03b2-catenin-activating mutations are rare in melanomas, and since \u03b2-catenin signaling is implicated in melanoma, we examined the relationship between \u03b2-catenin levels/activity and expression of \u03b2-catenin transcriptional targets Rad6 and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor-M (Mitf-M) in melanoma cell models, and expression of Rad6, \u03b2-catenin, and Melan-A in nevi and cutaneous melanoma tissue specimens. Our data show that Rad6 is only weakly expressed in normal human melanocytes but is overexpressed in melanoma lines. Unlike Mitf-M, Rad6 overexpression in melanoma lines is positively associated with high molecular weight \u03b2-catenin protein levels and \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity. Double-immunofluorescence staining of Rad6 and Melan-A in melanoma tissue microarray showed that histological diagnosis of melanoma is significantly associated with Rad6/Melan-A dual positivity in the melanoma group compared to the nevi group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0029). In contrast to strong \u03b2-catenin expression in normal and tumor areas of superficial spreading malignant melanoma (SSMM), Rad6 expression is undetectable in normal areas and Rad6 expression increases coincide with increased Melan-A in the transformed regions of SSMM. These data suggest a role for Rad6 in melanoma pathogenesis and that Rad6 expression status may serve as an early marker for melanoma development.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Solid tumors are known to have an abnormal vasculature that limits the distribution of chemotherapy. We have recently shown that tumor vessel modulation by low-dose photodynamic therapy (L-PDT) could improve the uptake of macromolecular chemotherapeutic agents such as liposomal doxorubicin (Liporubicin) administered subsequently. However, how this occurs is unknown. Convection, the main mechanism for drug transport between the intravascular and extravascular spaces, is mostly related to interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) and tumor blood flow (TBF). Here, we determined the changes of tumor and surrounding lung IFP and TBF before, during, and after vascular L-PDT. We also evaluated the effect of these changes on the distribution of Liporubicin administered intravenously (IV) in a lung sarcoma metastasis model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A syngeneic methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma cell line was implanted subpleurally in the lung of Fischer rats. Tumor/surrounding lung IFP and TBF changes induced by L-PDT were determined using the wick-in-needle technique and laser Doppler flowmetry, respectively. The spatial distribution of Liporubicin in tumor and lung tissues following IV drug administration was then assessed in L-PDT\u2013pretreated animals and controls (no L-PDT) by epifluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: L-PDT significantly decreased tumor but not lung IFP compared to controls (no L-PDT) without affecting TBF. These conditions were associated with a significant improvement in Liporubicin distribution in tumor tissues compared to controls (P < .05). DISCUSSION: L-PDT specifically enhanced convection in blood vessels of tumor but not of normal lung tissue, which was associated with a significant improvement of Liporubicin distribution in tumors compared to controls.",

Using an orthotopic xenograft model of lung carcinoma, we have investigated the combination of radiotherapy with the anti-angiogenic drug axitinib (AG-013736, Pfizer), which is a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively targets the signal transduction induced by VEGF binding to VEGFR receptors. We have tested the combination of axitinib with radiotherapy in nude mice bearing human NSCLC A549 lung tumors. The therapy effect was quantitatively evaluated in lung tumor nodules. The modulation of radiation-induced pneumonitis, vascular damage and fibrosis by axitinib was assessed in lung tissue. Lung irradiation combined with long-term axitinib treatment was safe resulting in minimal weight loss and no vascular injury in heart, liver and kidney tissues. A significant decrease in the size of lung tumor nodules was observed with either axitinib or radiation, associated with a decrease in Ki-67 staining and a heavy infiltration of inflammatory cells in tumor nodules. The lungs of mice treated with radiation and axitinib showed a complete response with no detectable residual tumor nodules. A decrease in pneumonitis, vascular damage and fibrosis were observed in lung tissues from mice treated with radiation and axitinib. Our studies suggest that axitinib is a potent and safe drug to use in conjunction with radiotherapy for lung cancer that could also act as a radioprotector for lung tissue by reducing pneumonitis and fibrosis.",

Among the predicted and identified PC substrates, an increasing number of proteins having functions in cancer progression indicate that PCs may be potential targets for antineoplastic drugs. In support of this notion, we identified PACE4 as a vital PC involved in prostate cancer proliferation and progression, contrasting with the other co-expressed PCs. The aim of the present study was to test the importance of PCs in ovarian cancer cell proliferation and tumor progression. Based on tissue-expression profiles, furin, PACE4, PC5/6 and PC7 all displayed increased expression in primary tumor, ascites cells and metastases. These PCs were also expressed in variable levels in three model ovarian cell lines tested, namely SKOV3, CAOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. Since SKOV3 cells closely represented the PC expression profile of ovarian cancer cells, we chose them to test the effects of PC silencing using stable gene-silencing shRNA strategy to generate knockdown SKOV3 cells for each expressed PC. In vitro and in vivo assays confirmed the role of PACE4 in the sustainment of SKOV3 cell proliferation, which was not observed with the other three PCs. We also tested PACE4 peptide inhibitors on all three cell lines and observed consequent reduced cell proliferation which was correlated with PACE4 expression. Overall, these data support a role of PACE4 in promoting cell proliferation in ovarian cancer and provides further evidence for PACE4 as a potential therapeutic target.",

     "abstract": "The targeted migration of neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) is a prerequisite for the use of stem cell therapy in the treatment of pathologies. This migration is regulated mainly by C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12). Therefore, promotion of the migratory responses of grafted cells by upregulating CXCL12 signaling has been proposed as a strategy for improving the efficacy of such cell therapies. However, the effects of this strategy on brain tumors have not yet been examined in vivo. The aim of the present study was thus to elucidate the effects of grafted rat green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2013labeled NSPCs (GFP-NSPCs) with CXCL12 enhancement on a model of spontaneous rat brain tumor induced by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was applied to determine the changes in tumor volume and morphology over time. Postmortem histology was performed to confirm the tumor pathology, expression levels of CXCL12 and C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4, and the fate of GFP-NSPCs. The results showed that the tumor volume and hypointense areas of T2-weighted images were both significantly increased in animals treated with combined NSPC transplantation and CXCL12 induction, but not in control animals or in those with tumors that received only one of the treatments. GFP-NSPCs appear to migrate toward tumors with CXCL12 enhancement and differentiate uniquely into a neuronal lineage. These findings suggest that CXCL12 is an effective chemoattractant that facilitates exogenous NSPC migration toward brain tumors and that CXCL12 and NSPC can act synergistically to promote tumor progression with severe hemorrhage.",

We compared expression levels with several clinical parameters, as well as metastasis, recurrence, and overall survival (OS). CXCL12-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3 are highly co-expressed, with low expression correlating with more aggressive subtypes, higher stage disease, and worse clinical outcomes. CXCL12-\u03b4 did not correlate with other isoforms but was prognostic for OS and showed the same trend for metastasis and recurrence-free survival. Effects of CXCL12-\u03b4 remained independently prognostic when taking into account expression of CXCL12, CXCR4, and CXCR7. These results were also reflected when comparing CXCL12-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3 in breast cancer cell lines. We summarized expression of all CXCL12 isoforms in an important chemokine signaling pathway in breast cancer in a large clinical cohort and common breast cancer cell lines, establishing differences among isoforms in multiple clinical, pathologic, and molecular subgroups.

Mice were monitored with bioluminescence imaging.In vitro, treatment with ABT-888 and radiation led to higher rates of cell death after 8\u00a0days (P < .01). Co-treatment with 5\u00a0Gy and 1, 10 or 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/l of ABT-888 led to dose enhancement factors of 1.29, 1.41 and 2.36, respectively.

ABT-888 inhibited PAR protein polymerization resulting in dose-dependent feedback up-regulation of PARP and p-ATM suggesting increased DNA damage. This translated into enhancement in TGI and survival with radiation in vivo. In vitro PAR levels correlated with levels of tumor apoptosis suggesting potential as a predictive biomarker.

One week after DSS treatment, there were typical DSS-induced colitis lesions in both WT and uPA\u2212/\u2212 mice. The affected colon of uPA\u2212/\u2212 mice, however, had features of delayed ulcer re-epithelialization and dysplastic lesions of higher grade developing on the basis of a significantly altered mucosal inflammatory milieu.

We measured Ang2 expression in human tissue and plasma, and tested the effect of dual Ang1/2 (trebananib; AMG386) or Ang2 alone (L1-7) inhibition with VEGFR inhibition on murine RCC growth and blood flow. Ang2 levels were higher in human tumors than normal tissues with RCC ranking highest for Ang2 expression across all tumor types tested. Plasma Ang2 was significantly higher in patients with mRCC compared to controls or patients with stage I disease. Plasma Ang2 decreased with sunitinib treatment and increased at time of disease progression. In the RCC mouse, dual Ang1/2 and Ang2 inhibition improved the activity of sunitinib. Combined Ang1/2 and VEGFR inhibition prevented the resumption of blood flow associated with sunitinib resistance. Thus, Ang2 inhibition, independent of Ang1 inhibition, improves the activity of sunitinib and plasma Ang2 increases in the setting of progression on sunitinib possibly contributing to resistance. Further, arterial spin-labeled perfusion magnetic resonance imaging might be a non-invasive marker of the antiangiogenic activity of Ang inhibitors.",

Fluorophore (Alexa Fluor 350 and Alexa Fluor 647) conjugated WGA was topically applied to the tissue samples and imaged using a custom wide-field fluorescence imaging system. All seven patients had histologically confirmed disease with 6/7 exhibiting squamous cell carcinoma and 1/7 exhibiting dysplasia. Fluorescent data collected from all patients demonstrated that fluorophore conjugated WGA could distinguish between pathologically normal and diseased tissue with the average signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) among all patients being 5.88 (P = .00046). This SNR was statistically significantly higher than the SNR from differences in tissue autofluorescence (P = .0049). A lectin inhibitory experiment confirmed that lectin binding is molecularly specific to overexpressed tumor glycans and that fluorescence is not due to tissue optical properties or tissue diffusion differences. These results illustrate that changes in tumor glycan content of oral neoplasms can be detected with optical imaging using topically applied fluorescently labeled WGA.

METHODS: The synergistic antitumor effect of sunitinib and rapamycin on tumor growth and metastasis was investigated. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in spleens and lungs were assessed. Tumor hypoxia, vessel density and micrometastasis were evaluated. Versican, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), arginase 1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in the lungs and tumors were examined.

Sunitinib plus rapamycin reduced splenomegaly, MDSCs in spleens and lungs, and microvessel density in tumor microenvironment, while exacerbated hypoxia and promoted cancer lung metastasis. Sunitinib plus rapamycin markedly induced versican, IDO, arginase 1, IL-6, and TGF-\u03b2 expression in the lungs, whereas it reduced IDO and IL-10 expression in the primary tumor tissues. IL-6 levels in the circulation were increased after rapamycin and combination therapies.

Optically based techniques could potentially contribute to fast and objective response monitoring in personalized cancer therapy. In the present study, we evaluated the feasibility of dual-modality diffuse reflectance spectroscopy\u2013autofluorescence spectroscopy (DRS-AFS) to monitor the effects of systemic treatment in a mouse model for hereditary breast cancer. METHODS: Brca1\u2212/\u2212; p53\u2212/\u2212 mammary tumors were grown in 36 mice, half of which were treated with a single dose of cisplatin. Changes in the tumor physiology and morphology were measured for a period of 1 week using dual-modality DRS-AFS. Liver and muscle tissues were also measured to distinguish tumor-specific alterations from systemic changes. Model-based analyses were used to derive different optical parameters like the scattering and absorption coefficients, as well as sources of intrinsic fluorescence. Histopathologic analysis was performed for cross-validation with trends in optically based parameters. RESULTS: Treated tumors showed a significant decrease in Mie-scattering slope and Mie-to-total scattering fraction and an increase in both fat volume fraction and tissue oxygenation after 2 days of follow-up. Additionally, significant tumor-specific changes in the fluorescence spectra were seen. These longitudinal trends were consistent with changes observed in the histopathologic analysis, such as vital tumor content and formation of fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that dual-modality DRS-AFS provides quantitative functional information that corresponds well with the degree of pathologic response.

In contrast, 18F-FDG uptake was significantly lower in normoxic portion (little pimonidazole binding or GLUT-1 expression) of larger serosal tumors or subcutaneous xenografts, which was not statistically different from that in the liver. CONCLUSIONS: Glucose demand (18F-FDG uptake) in severely hypoxic ascites carcinomas and hypoxic portion of larger tumors is significantly higher than in normoxic cancer cells. Warburg effect originally obtained from Ehrlich ascites carcinoma may not apply to normoxic cancer cells. Our findings may benefit the better understanding of 18F-FDG PET in oncology application.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preoperative peripheral blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been proposed to predict prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the cutoff value of NLR in several studies is not consistent. This study aims to investigate the correlation of preoperative NLR with clinicopathologic features and the prognosis in patients who have undergone resection for HCC. METHODS: Clinical data of 256 patients with HCC who underwent radical hepatectomy were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into the low-NLR group (NLR \u2264 2.31) and the high-NLR group (NLR > 2.31). A univariate analysis was performed to assess clinicopathologic characteristics that influenced disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients. The significant variables were further analyzed by a multivariate analysis using Cox regression. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to assess the DFS and OS rate. RESULTS: The value of NLR was associated with tumor size, clinical tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), distant metastasis, and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in HCC. NLR > 2.31, size of tumor > 5 cm, number of multiple tumors, III-IV of TNM stage, PVTT, distant metastasis, and AST > 40 U/l were predictors of poorer DFS and OS. NLR > 2.31, size of tumor >\u00a05 cm, III-IV of TNM stage, and AST > 40 U/l were independent predictors of DFS and OS. CONCLUSION: Preoperative NLR > 2.31 was an adverse predictor of DFS and OS in HCC after hepatectomy. This study suggested that NLR might be a novel prognostic biomarker in HCC after curative resection.",

Our results showed that the BO-1509 and LY294002 combination synergistically killed lung cancer cells in culture and also suppressed the growth of lung cancer xenografts in mice, including those derived from gefitinib-resistant cells. We also found that LY294002 suppressed the induction of several DNA repair proteins by BO-1509 and inhibited the nuclear translocation of Rad51. On the basis of the results of the \u03b3H2AX foci formation assays, LY294002 apparently inhibited the repair of DNA damage that was induced by BO-1509. According to the complete blood profile, biochemical enzyme analysis, and histopathologic analysis of major organs, no apparent toxicity was observed in mice treated with BO-1509 alone or in combination with LY294002.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction cancer were enrolled in this study after undergoing radical resection. The patients received the following chemotherapy: docetaxel (60 mg/m2) on day 1, cisplatin (12 mg/m2 per day) on days 1 to 5, and 5-FU (2500 mg/m2) continuous infusion for 120 hours, repeated every 3 weeks for six cycles. The primary end point was disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: The median DFS was 17.0 months. The 1-year DFS was 72%, and the 2-year DFS was 37.5%. The median overall survival was 28.0 months. Using univariate analysis, the technique of lymph node dissection was a predictor for postoperative relapse. The median DFS was 15.0 months in the D1 group and 18.0 months in the D2 group (P = .043). The most frequent grade 3/4 adverse events were neutropenia (56.25%), diarrhea (9.38%), nausea (6.25%), and vomiting (6.25%); 12.5% of patients developed febrile neutropenia.

METHODS: We prepared targeted apoptosis ultrasound probes by nanobubble (NB) binding with Annexin V. In vitro, we investigated the binding rate of NB\u2013Annexin V with breast cancer apoptotic cells after the trastuzumab treatment. In vivo, tumor-bearing mice underwent ultrasound targeted imaging over 7 days. After imaging was completed, the tumors were excised to determine Her-2 and caspase-3 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlation between parameters of imaging and histologic results was then analyzed. RESULTS: For seeking the ability of targeted NB binding with apoptotic tumor cells (Her-2 positive), we found that binding rate in the treatment group was higher than that of the control group in vitro (P = .001). There were no differences of tumor sizes in all groups over the treatment process in vivo (P = .98). However, when using ultrasound imaging to visualize tumors by targeted NB in vivo, we observed that the mean and peak intensities from NBs gradually increased in the treatment group after trastuzumab therapy (P = .001). Furthermore, these two parameters were significantly associated with caspase-3 expression of tumor excised samples (P = .0001).

However, its induction of invasive proliferation has also been reported. We examined the effects of treatment with cilengitide, an integrin inhibitor, on bevacizumab-induced invasive changes in glioma. U87\u0394EGFR cells were stereotactically injected into the brain of nude mice or rats. Five days after tumor implantation, cilengitide and bevacizumab were administered intraperitoneally three times a week. At 18 days after tumor implantation, the brains were removed and observed histopathologically. Next, the bevacizumab and cilengitide combination group was compared to the bevacizumab monotherapy group using microarray analysis. Bevacizumab treatment led to increased cell invasion in spite of decreased angiogenesis. When the rats were treated with a combination of bevacizumab and cilengitide, the depth of tumor invasion was significantly less than with only bevacizumab. Pathway analysis demonstrated the inhibition of invasion-associated genes such as the integrin-mediated cell adhesion pathway in the combination group. This study showed that the combination of bevacizumab with cilengitide exerted its anti-invasive effect. The elucidation of this mechanism might contribute to the treatment of bevacizumab-refractory glioma.",

Here, we provide evidence implicating aberrant Hippo signaling in ccRCC proliferation, invasiveness, and metastatic potential. Nuclear overexpression of the Hippo target Yes-associated protein (YAP) was found in a subset of patients with ccRCC. Immunostaining was particularly prominent at the tumor margins and highlighted neoplastic cells invading the tumor-adjacent stroma. Short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of YAP significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and anchorage-independent growth of ccRCC cells in soft agar and led to significantly reduced murine xenograft growth. Microarray analysis of YAP knockdown versus mock-transduced ccRCC cells revealed down-regulation of endothelin 1, endothelin 2, cysteine-rich, angiogenic inducer, 61 (CYR61), and c-Myc in ccRCC cells as well as up-regulation of the cell adhesion molecule cadherin 6. Signaling pathway impact analysis revealed activation of the p53 signaling and cell cycle pathways as well as inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling on YAP down-regulation. Our data suggest CYR61 and c-Myc as well as signaling through the endothelin axis as bona fide downstream effectors of YAP and establish aberrant Hippo signaling as a potential therapeutic target in ccRCC.",

     "abstract": "MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations from 32 patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) enrolled in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Spatial variations in T1 post-gadolinium and either T2-weighted or fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequences from each tumor MRI study were used to characterize each small region of the tumor by its local contrast enhancement and edema/cellularity (\u201chabitat\u201d). The patient cohort was divided into group 1 (survival < 400 days, n = 16) and group 2 (survival > 400 days, n = 16). RESULTS: Histograms of relative values in each sequence demonstrated that the tumor regions were consistently divided into high and low blood contrast enhancement, each of which could be subdivided into regions of high, low, and intermediate cell density/interstitial edema. Group 1 tumors contained greater volumes of habitats with low contrast enhancement but intermediate and high cell density (not fully necrotic) than group 2. Both leave-one-out and 10-fold cross-validation schemes demonstrated that individual patients could be correctly assigned to the short or long survival group with 81.25% accuracy. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that novel image analytic techniques can characterize regional habitat variations in GBMs using combinations of MRI sequences. A preliminary study of 32 patients from the TCGA database found that the distribution of MRI-defined habitats varied significantly among the different survival groups. Radiologically defined ecological tumor analysis may provide valuable prognostic and predictive biomarkers in GBM and other tumors.",

Thirty-three patients underwent DCE-MRI (to estimate Ktrans, ve, kep, and vp) and DW-MRI [to estimate the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)] at baseline (t1) and after the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (t2). Four analyses were performed and evaluated using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to test their ability to predict pCR. First, a region of interest (ROI) level analysis input the mean Ktrans, ve, kep, vp, and ADC into the logistic model. Second, a voxel-based analysis was performed in which a longitudinal registration algorithm aligned serial parameters to a common space for each patient. The voxels with an increase in kep, Ktrans, and vp or a decrease in ADC or ve were then detected and input into the regression model. In the third analysis, both the ROI and voxel level data were included in the regression model. In the fourth analysis, the ROI and voxel level data were combined with selected clinical data in the regression model. The overfitting-corrected area under the ROC curve (AUC) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was then calculated to evaluate the performance of the four analyses. The combination of kep, ADC ROI, and voxel level data achieved the best AUC (95% CI) of 0.87 (0.77\u20130.98).",

     "abstract": "There are two key challenges hindering effective use of quantitative assessment of imaging in cancer response assessment: 1) Radiologists usually describe the cancer lesions in imaging studies subjectively and sometimes ambiguously, and 2) it is difficult to repurpose imaging data, because lesion measurements are not recorded in a format that permits machine interpretation and interoperability. We have developed a freely available software platform on the basis of open standards, the electronic Physician Annotation Device (ePAD), to tackle these challenges in two ways. First, ePAD facilitates the radiologist in carrying out cancer lesion measurements as part of routine clinical trial image interpretation workflow. Second, ePAD records all image measurements and annotations in a data format that permits repurposing image data for analyses of alternative imaging biomarkers of treatment response. To determine the impact of ePAD on radiologist efficiency in quantitative assessment of imaging studies, a radiologist evaluated computed tomography (CT) imaging studies from 20 subjects having one baseline and three consecutive follow-up imaging studies with and without ePAD. The radiologist made measurements of target lesions in each imaging study using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, initially with the aid of ePAD, and then after a 30-day washout period, the exams were reread without ePAD. The mean total time required to review the images and summarize measurements of target lesions was 15% (P < .039) shorter using ePAD than without using this tool. In addition, it was possible to rapidly reanalyze the images to explore lesion cross-sectional area as an alternative imaging biomarker to linear measure.We conclude that ePAD appears promising to potentially improve reader efficiency for quantitative assessment of CT examinations, and it may enable discovery of future novel image-based biomarkers of cancer treatment response.",

     "abstract": "Standard-of-care therapy for glioblastomas, the most common and aggressive primary adult brain neoplasm, is maximal safe resection, followed by radiation and chemotherapy. Because maximizing resection may be beneficial for these patients, improving tumor extent of resection (EOR) with methods such as intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is currently under evaluation. However, it is difficult to reproducibly judge EOR in these studies due to the lack of reliable tumor segmentation methods, especially for postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Therefore, a reliable, easily distributable segmentation method is needed to permit valid comparison, especially across multiple sites. We report a segmentation method that combines versatile region-of-interest blob generation with automated clustering methods. We applied this to glioblastoma cases undergoing FGS and matched controls to illustrate the method's reliability and accuracy. Agreement and interrater variability between segmentations were assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient, and spatial accuracy was determined using the Dice similarity index and mean Euclidean distance. Fuzzy C-means clustering with three classes was the best performing method, generating volumes with high agreement with manual contouring and high interrater agreement preoperatively and postoperatively. The proposed segmentation method allows tumor volume measurements of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images in the unbiased, reproducible fashion necessary for quantifying EOR in multicenter trials.",

One cross-calibration kit was constructed for both dose calibrators and PET scanners using the same 9-month half-life batch of 68Ge/68Ga in epoxy. Repeat measurements occurred in a local network of PET imaging sites to assess standardized uptake value (SUV) errors over time for six dose calibrators from two major manufacturers and for six PET/CT scanners from three major manufacturers. Bias in activity measures by dose calibrators ranged from \u221250%to 9%and was relatively stable over time except at one site that modified settings between measurements. Bias in activity concentration measures by PET scanners ranged from \u221227% to 13% with a median of 174 days between the six repeat scans (range, 29 to 226 days).

We report the results of an original study initiated in 2007, where cetuximab was tested with radiotherapy (RT) alone in locally advanced pancreatic cancer in a phase II trial (PACER). METHODS: Patients (n = 21) received cetuximab loading dose (400 mg/m2) and weekly dose (250 mg/m2) during RT (50.4 Gy in 28 fractions). Toxicity and disease response end point data were prospectively assessed. A feasibility study of on-trial patient blood and skin sampling was incorporated. RESULTS: Treatment was well tolerated, toxicity was low; most patients (71%) experienced acute toxicities of grade 2 or less. Six months posttreatment, stable local disease was achieved in 90% of evaluable patients, but only 33% were free from metastatic progression. Median overall survival was 7.5 months, actuarial survival was 33% at 1 year and 11% at 3 years, reflecting swift metastatic progression in some patients but good long-term control of localized disease in others. High-grade acneiform rash (P = .0027), posttreatment stable disease (P = .0059), pretreatment cancer antigen 19.9 (CA19.9) level (P = .0042) associated with extended survival. Patient skin and blood samples yielded sufficient RNA and good quality protein, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that cetuximab inhibits EGFR-mediated radioresistance to achieve excellent local control with minimal toxicity but does not sufficiently control metastatic progression in all patients.

Pseudodynamic images were acquired over multiple series using four scanners such that the histogram of pixel intensities varied enough to provoke variable image scaling from series to series. Additional diffusion-weighted images were acquired of an ice-water phantom to generate scanner-specific apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps. The resulting pseudodynamic images and ADC maps were analyzed by eight centers of the Quantitative Imaging Network using 16 different SW tools to measure compartment-specific region-of-interest intensity. RESULTS: Images generated by one of the scanners appeared to have additional intensity scaling that was not accounted for by the majority of tested quantitative image analysis SW tools. Incorrect image scaling leads to intensity measurement bias near 100%, compared to nonscaled images.

Thirty-two NSCLC nonenhanced lung CT scans were obtained from the Reference Image Database to Evaluate Response data set. The tumors were segmented using both manual (radiologist expert) and ensemble (software-automated) methods. A set of features (219 threedimensional and 110 two-dimensional) was computed, quantitative image features were statistically filtered to identify a subset of reproducible and nonredundant features. The variability in the repeated experiment was measured by the test-retest concordance correlation coefficient (CCCTreT). The natural range in the features, normalized to variance, was measured by the dynamic range (DR). In this study, there were 29 features across segmentation methods found with CCCTreT and DR \u2265 0.9 and R2Bet \u2265 0.95. These reproducible features were tested for predicting radiologist prognostic score; some texture features (run-length and Laws kernels) had an area under the curve of 0.9.

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: To explore the effects of computed tomography (CT) slice thickness and reconstruction algorithm on quantification of image features to characterize tumors using a chest phantom. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twentytwo phantom lesions of known sizes (10 and 20 mm), shapes (spherical, elliptical, lobulated, spiculated), densities [\u2212630, \u221210, +100 Hounsfield Unit (HU)] were inserted into an anthropomorphic thorax phantom and scanned three times with relocations. The raw data were reconstructed using six imaging settings, i.e., a combination of three slice thicknesses of 1.25, 2.5, 5 mm and two reconstruction kernels of lung and standard. Lesions were segmented and 14 image features representing lesion size, shape, texture were calculated. Differences in the measured image features due to slice thickness and reconstruction algorithm were compared using linear regression method by adjusting three confounding variables (size, density, shape). RESULTS: All 14 features were significantly different between 1.25 and 5 mm slice images. The 1.25 and 2.5 mm slice thicknesses were better than 5 mm for volume, density mean, density SD gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) energy and homogeneity. As for the reconstruction algorithm, there was no significant difference in uni-dimension, volume, shape index 9, compactness. Lung reconstruction was better for density mean, whereas standard reconstruction was better for density SD. CONCLUSIONS: CT slice thickness and reconstruction algorithm can significantly affect the quantification of image features. Thinner (1.25 and 2.5 mm) and thicker (5 mm) slice images should not be used interchangeably. Sharper and smoother reconstructions significantly affect the density-based features.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the Aegis software implementation for real-time calculation of functional tumor volume (FTV) in the neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment trial setting. METHODS: The validation data set consisted of 689 contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations from the multicenter American College of Radiology Imaging Network 6657 study. Subjects had stage III tumors \u22653 cm in diameter and underwent MRI before, during, after receiving anthracycline-cyclophosphamide chemotherapy. Studies were previously analyzed by the University of California San Francisco core laboratory using the three-timepoint signal enhancement ratio (SER) FTV algorithm; FTV measurement was subsequently implemented on the Hologic (formerly Sentinelle Medical Inc) Aegis platform. All cases were processed using predefined volumes of interest with no user interaction. Spearman rank correlation was evaluated for all study sites and visits. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compare predictive performance of the platforms for recurrence-free survival (RFS) time. RESULTS: Overall agreement between platforms was good; \u03c1 varied from 0.96 to 0.98 for different study visits. Site-by-site analysis showed considerable variation, from \u03c1 = 0.54 to near perfect agreement (\u03c1 = 1.000) for several sites. Mean absolute difference between platforms ranged from 1.67 cm3 pretreatment to 0.2 cm3 posttreatment. The two platforms showed essentially identical performance for predicting RFS using pretreatment or posttreatment FTV. CONCLUSION: Implementation of the SER FTV algorithm on a commercial platform for real-time MRI volume assessments showed very good agreement with the reference core laboratory system, but variations by site and outlier analysis point out sensitivities to implementation-specific differences.",

Image registration of longitudinal scans provides a method of detecting treatment-associated changes within heterogeneous tumors by monitoring alterations in the quantitative value of individual voxels over time, which is unattainable by traditional volumetric-based histogram methods. The concepts involved in the use of image registration for tracking and quantifying breast cancer treatment response using parametric response mapping (PRM), a voxel-based analysis of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) scans, are presented. Application of PRM to breast tumor response detection is described, wherein robust registration solutions for tracking small changes in water diffusivity in breast tumors during therapy are required. Methodologies that employ simulations are presented for measuring expected statistical accuracy of PRM for response assessment. Test-retest clinical scans are used to yield estimates of system noise to indicate significant changes in voxel-based changes in water diffusivity. Overall, registration-based PRM image analysis provides significant opportunities for voxel-based image analysis to provide the required accuracy for early assessment of response to treatment in breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Evaluation of cancer-therapy efficacy at early time points is necessary for realizing the goal of delivering maximally effective treatment. Molecular imaging with carefully selected tracers and methodologies can provide the means for realizing this ability. Many therapies are aimed at inducing apoptosis in malignant tissue; thus, the ability to quantify apoptosis in vivo may be a fruitful approach. Apoptosis rate changes occur on a fast time scale, potentially allowing correspondingly rapid decisions regarding therapy value. However, quantification of tissue status based on apoptosis imaging is complicated by this time scale and by the spatial heterogeneity of the process. Using the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer 2-(5-fluoro-pentyl)-2-methyl-malonic acid (F-18 ML-10), we present methods of voxelwise analysis yielding quantitative measures of apoptosis changes, parametric apoptosis change images, and graphical representation of apoptotic features. A method of deformable registration to account for anatomic changes between scan time points is also demonstrated. Overall apoptotic rates deduced from imaging depend on tumor density and the specific rate of apoptosis, a situation resulting in an ambiguity in the source of observed image-based changes. The ambiguity may be resolved through multimodality imaging. An example of intracellular sodium magnetic resonance imaging coupled with F-18 ML-10 PET is provided.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the variability and repeatability of repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements in normal breast tissues between and within subjects. METHODS: Eighteen normal premenopausal subjects underwent two contrast-enhanced MRI scans within 72 hours or during the same menstrual phase in two consecutive months. A subset of nine women also completed diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Fibroglandular tissue (FGT) density and FGT enhancement were measured on the contrast-enhanced MRI. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were computed from DWI. Between- and within-subject coefficients of variation (bCV and wCV, respectively) were assessed. Repeatability of all measurements was assessed by the coefficient of repeatability (CR) and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: The bCV of FGT density and FGT enhancement at visit 1 and visit 2 ranged from 47% to 63%. The wCV was 13% for FGT density, 22% for FGT enhancement, and 11% for ADC. The CRs of FGT density and FGT enhancement were 0.15 and 0.19, respectively, and for ADC, it was 6.1 x 10-4 mm2/s.

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: There is growing interest in using positron emission tomography (PET) standardized uptake values (SUVs) to assess tumor response to therapy. However, many error sources compromise the ability to detect SUV changes. We explore relationships between these errors and overall SUV variability. METHODS: We used simulations in a virtual clinical trial framework to study impacts of error sources from scanning and analysis effects on assessment of SUV changes. We varied tumor diameter, scan duration, pretherapy SUV, magnitude of change in SUV, image reconstruction filter, and SUV metric. Poisson noise was added to the raw data before image reconstruction. Variance from global sources of error, e.g., scanner calibration, was incorporated. Two thousand independent noisy sinograms per scenario were generated and reconstructed. We used SUVs to create receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to quantify ability to assess response. Integrating area under the ROC curve summarized ability to detect SUV changes. RESULTS: Scan duration and image reconstruction method had relatively little impact on ability to measure response. SUVMAX is nearly as effective as SUVMEAN, especially with increased image smoothing and despite size-matched region of interest placement. For an effective variability of 15%, we found the Positron Emission Tomography Response Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria for measuring response (\u00b130%) similar to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer criteria (\u00b125%). CONCLUSIONS: For typical PET variance levels, tumor response must be 30% to 40% to be reliably determined using SUVs. PET scan duration and image reconstruction method had relatively little effect.",

A plethora of factors in DCE-MRI data acquisition and analysis can affect accuracy and precision of these parameters and, consequently, the utility of quantitative DCE-MRI for assessing therapy response. In this multicenter data analysis challenge, DCE-MRI data acquired at one center from 10 patients with breast cancer before and after the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were shared and processed with 12 software tools based on the Tofts model (TM), extended TM, and Shutter-Speed model. Inputs of tumor region of interest definition, pre-contrast T1, and arterial input function were controlled to focus on the variations in parameter value and response prediction capability caused by differences in models and associated algorithms. Considerable parameter variations were observed with the within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) values for Ktrans and vp being as high as 0.59 and 0.82, respectively. Parameter agreement improved when only algorithms based on the same model were compared, e.g., the Ktrans intraclass correlation coefficient increased to as high as 0.84. Agreement in parameter percentage change was much better than that in absolute parameter value, e.g., the pairwise concordance correlation coefficient improved from 0.047 (for Ktrans) to 0.92 (for Ktrans percentage change) in comparing two TM algorithms. Nearly all algorithms provided good to excellent (univariate logistic regression c-statistic value ranging from 0.8 to 1.0) early prediction of therapy response using the metrics of mean tumor Ktrans and kep (= Ktrans/ve, intravasation rate constant) after the first therapy cycle and the corresponding percentage changes.

To this end, we analyzed the delivery and uptake of ProSense as well as the target protease and its cellular source in a mouse xenograft tumor model. In vivo and ex vivo multi wavelength imaging revealed that ProSense signals accumulated within tumors, with preferential distribution in the vascular leakage area that correlates with vasculature development at the tumor periphery. Immunohistochemically, cathepsin B, which is targeted by ProSense, was specifically localized in macrophages. The codistribution of tenascin C immunoreactivity and gelatinase activity provided evidence of tissue-remodeling at the tumor periphery. Furthermore, in situ zymography revealed extracellular ProSense cleavage in such areas. Colocalization of cathepsin B expression and ProSense signals showing reduction by addition of cathepsin B inhibitor was confirmed in cultured macrophage-derived RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest that increased tissue-remodeling activity involving infiltration of macrophages is a mechanism that may be responsible for the tumor accumulation of ProSense signals in our xenograft model. We further confirmed ProSense signals at the tumor margin showing cathepsin B+ macrophage infiltration in a rat colon carcinogenesis model. Together, these data demonstrate that systemically administered protease-activatable probes can effectively detect cancer invasive fronts, where tissue-remodeling activity is high to facilitate neoplastic cell invasion.",

Recent studies highlight the ability of exosomes to convey tumor-suppressive and oncogenic mRNAs, microRNAs, and proteins to a receiving cell, subsequently activating downstream signaling pathways and influencing cellular phenotype. Here, we show that radiation increases the abundance of exosomes released by glioblastoma cells and normal astrocytes. Exosomes derived from irradiated cells enhanced the migration of recipient cells, and their molecular profiling revealed an abundance of molecules related to signaling pathways important for cell migration. In particular, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) protein levels were elevated, and coculture of nonirradiated cells with exosomes isolated from irradiated cells increased CTGF protein expression in the recipient cells. Additionally, these exosomes enhanced the activation of neurotrophic tyrosine kinase receptor type 1 (TrkA), focal adhesion kinase, Paxillin, and proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src (Src) in recipient cells, molecules involved in cell migration. Collectively, our data suggest that radiation influences exosome abundance, specifically alters their molecular composition, and on uptake, promotes a migratory phenotype.",

Mice fed control diet showed 80% and 62% incidence of PDAC in males and females, respectively. Male mice showed 20% and 26%, and female mice showed 7% and 0% PDAC incidence with 1000- and 2000-ppm metformin treatments, respectively. Both doses of metformin decreased pancreatic tumor weights by 34% to 49% (P < 0.03\u20130.001).

In particular, antiangiogenic therapies targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) pathway are commonly used, although, with limited effects. Here, using human omental microvascular endothelial cells (HOMECs) and ovarian cancer cell lines as an in vitro model, we show that factors secreted from EOC cells increased proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation in HOMECs. However, EOC-induced angiogenic tube-like formation and migration were unaffected by inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of VEGF receptors 1 and 2 (Semaxanib; SU5416) or neutralization of VEGFA (neutralizing anti-VEGFA antibody), although VEGFA165-induced HOMEC migration and tube-like structure formation were abolished. Proteomic investigation of the EOC secretome identified several alternative angiogenesis-related proteins. We screened these for their ability to induce an angiogenic phenotype in HOMECs, i.e., proliferation, migration, and tube-like structure formation. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7 (IGFBP-7) increased all three parameters, and cathepsin L (CL) increased migration and tubule formation. Further investigation confirmed expression of the HGF receptor c-Met in HOMECs. HGF- and EOC-induced proliferation and angiogenic tube structure formation were blocked by the c-Met inhibitor PF04217903. Our results highlight key alternative angiogenic mediators for metastatic EOC, namely, HGF, CL, and IGFBP-7, suggesting that effective antiangiogenic therapeutic strategies for this disease require inhibition of multiple angiogenic pathways.",

     "abstract": "Change of DNA cytosine methylation (5mC) is an early event in the development of cancer, and the recent discovery of a 5-hydroxymethylated form (5hmC) of cytosine suggests a regulatory epigenetic role that might be different from 5-methylcytosine. Here, we aimed at elucidating the role of 5hmC in breast cancer. To interrogate the 5hmC levels of the leucine zipper, putative tumor suppressor 1 (LZTS1) gene in detail, we analyzed 75 primary breast cancer tissue samples from initial diagnosis and 12 normal breast tissue samples derived from healthy persons. Samples were subjected to 5hmC glucosyltransferase treatment followed by restriction digestion and segment-specific amplification of 11 polymerase chain reaction products. Nine of the 11 5\u2032LZTS1 fragments showed significantly lower (fold change of 1.61\u20136.01, P < .05) 5hmC content in primary breast cancer tissue compared to normal breast tissue samples. No significant differences were observed for 5mC DNA methylation. Furthermore, both LZTS1 and TET1 mRNA expressions were significantly reduced in tumor samples (n = 75, P < .001, Student's t test), which correlated significantly with 5hmC levels in samples. 5hmC levels in breast cancer tissues were associated with unfavorable histopathologic parameters such as lymph node involvement (P < .05, Student's t test). A decrease of 5hmC levels of LZTS1, a classic tumor suppressor gene known to influence metastasis in breast cancer progression, is correlated to down-regulation of LZTS1 mRNA expression in breast cancer and might epigenetically enhance carcinogenesis. The study provides support for the novel hypothesis that suggests a strong influence of 5hmC on mRNA expression. Finally, one may also consider 5hmC as a new biomarker.",

     "abstract": "Exploring the re-emergence of embryonic signaling pathways may reveal important information for cancer biology. Nodal is a transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-related morphogen that plays a critical role during embryonic development. Nodal signaling is regulated by the Cripto-1 co-receptor and another TGF-\u03b2 member, Lefty. Although these molecules are poorly detected in differentiated tissues, they have been found in different human cancers. Poor prognosis of glioblastomas justifies the search for novel signaling pathways that can be exploited as potential therapeutic targets. Because our intracranial glioblastoma rat xenograft model has revealed importance of gene ontology categories related to development and differentiation, we hypothesized that increased activity of Nodal signaling could be found in glioblastomas. We examined the gene expressions of Nodal, Cripto-1, and Lefty in microarrays of invasive and angiogenic xenograft samples developed from four patients with glioblastoma. Protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 199 primary glioblastomas, and expression levels were analyzed for detection of correlations with available clinical information. Gene expression ofNodal, Lefty, and Cripto-1 was detected in the glioblastoma xenografts. Most patient samples showed significant levels of Cripto-1 detected by immunohistochemistry, whereas only weak to moderate levels were detected for Nodal and Lefty. Most importantly, the higher Cripto-1 scores were associated with shorter survival in a subset of younger patients. These findings suggest for the first time that Cripto-1, an important molecule in developmental biology, may represent a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target in categories of younger patients with glioblastoma.",

The aim of this study was to profile miR-132 expression in a cohort of patients with primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treated with the Stupp regimen and to correlate microRNA levels with patient outcome. METHODS: miR-132 levels relative to RNU44 were assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 43 GBMs and normal brain tissue. The cohort comprised patients less than 72 years of age with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scores between 0 and 2 who had undergone 6-week concomitant radiation and temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide. Survival data were available for all cases. Tumors were characterized for O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) methylation and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1/2 mutation status. Associations between miR-132 expression and clinical indicators were analyzed. RESULTS: Tumor miR-132 levels ranged from 0.07- to 40.4-fold increase (mean = 5.5-fold increase) relative to normal brain. High-level miR-132 (above the mean) independently predicted for a significantly shorter overall survival (P = .008). miR-132 was a stronger prognostic indicator than ECOG score (P = .012) and age at diagnosis (P = .026) but did not correlate with MGMT methylation status or extent of tumor resection. Cox regression analysis confirmed high miR-132 as the strongest predictor of outcome (P = .010) with a hazard ratio of 2.8. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified high miR-132 expression as a biomarker of poor prognosis in patients with primary GBM treated with the Stupp regimen.",

Three-dimensional (3D) telomere analysis on samples from patients diagnosed with MGUS and MM, as well as from patients who went into relapse. Telomere signal intensity, number of telomere aggregates, nuclear volume, and the overall nuclear telomere distribution (a/c ratio) were analyzed.

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: A few studies in the last several years have shown that metabolomics, the study of metabolites and small intermediate molecules, may help better understand the breast carcinogenesis. However, breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different subtypes. Additionally, there is a significant racial difference in terms of breast cancer incidence and mortality. Few, if any, metabolomics studies in breast cancer have considered race and tumor subtypes in the study design. METHODS: We performed a global metabolomic profiling using mass spectrometry and samples from 60 breast cancer cases and 60 matched controls. RESULTS: A total of 375 named metabolites were observed, with 117 metabolites whose levels were significantly different between African American and Caucasian American women (P < .05 and q < 0.10) and 78 that differed between breast cancer cases and healthy controls (P < .05 and q < 0.10). Most of those differentiated metabolites belong to amino acids, fatty acids, and lysolipids. In the pathway-based analysis, we found that plasma levels of many amino acids were statistically significantly lower in patients with breast cancer, especially those with triple-negative breast cancer, than healthy controls. However, plasma levels of many FAs related to \u03b2-oxidation were statistically significantly higher in patients with breast cancer than healthy controls, suggesting the possibility of altered FA \u03b2-oxidation in patients with breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Because of small sample size, the clinical usage of the metabolites from this study is unclear.

We evaluated the potential of various analytical techniques to predict survival of patients with glioma treated with chemoradiation. rCBV maps were acquired in patients with high-grade gliomas at 0, 1, and 3 weeks into chemoradiation therapy. Various analytical techniques were applied to the same cohort of serial rCBV data for early assessment of survival. Three different methodologies were investigated: 1) percentage change of whole tumor statistics (i.e., mean, median, and percentiles), 2) physiological segmentation (low rCBV, medium rCBV, or high rCBV), and 3) a voxel-based approach, parametric response mapping (PRM). All analyses were performed using the same tumor contours, which were determined using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery images. The predictive potential of each response metric was assessed at 1-year and overall survival. PRM was the only analytical approach found to generate a response metric significantly predictive of patient 1-year survival. Time of acquisition and contour volume were not found to alter the sensitivity of the PRM approach for predicting overall survival. We have demonstrated the importance of the analytical approach in early response assessment using serial rCBV maps. The PRM analysis shows promise as a unified early and robust imaging biomarker of treatment response in patients diagnosed with high-grade gliomas.",

METHODS: Nude mice with subcutaneous xenografts of human non-small cell lung cancer A549 and HTB177 cells and patients with lung cancer were included. In ex vivo study, intratumoral radioactivity of 18F-FDG, 18F-FLT, and the cocktail of 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT detected by autoradiography was compared with hypoxia (by pimonidazole) and proliferation (by bromodeoxyuridine) in tumor section. In in vivo study, first, 18F-FDG PET and 18F-FLT PET were conducted in the same subjects (mice and patients) 10 to 14 hours apart. Second, PET scan was also performed 1 hour after one tracer injection; subsequently, the other was administered and followed the second PET scan in the mouse. Finally, 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT cocktail PET scan was also performed in the mouse. RESULTS: When injected individually, 18F-FDG highly accumulated in hypoxic zones and high 18F-FLT in proliferative cancer cells. In case of cocktail injection, high radioactivity correlated with hypoxic regions and highly proliferative and normoxic regions. PET detected that intratumoral distribution of 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT was generally mismatched in both rodents and patients. Combination of 18F-FLT and 18F-FDG appeared to map more cancer tissue than single-tracer PET. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT PET imaging would give a more accurate representation of total viable tumor tissue than either tracer alone and would be a powerful imaging strategy for cancer management.",

Maraviroc, a small molecule CCR antagonist, is used as a part of combination antiretroviral therapy to treat persons infected by R5 HIV-1. CCR5 is expressed in various cancers, and its level of expression is a negative predictor of patients' survival in gastric cancers. Here, we report MKN45, MKN74, and KATOIII cells, three human gastric cancer cell lines with different stages of differentiation, which express CCR5 as detected by flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and its ligand RANTES. In vitro experiments demonstrate that CCR5 antagonism reduces gastric cancer cell migration induced by macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1 (MIP-1\u03b1), MIP-1\u03b2, and RANTES and adhesion to the ex-planted murine peritoneum. Administration of maraviroc from days 3 to 10 after MKN45 cell inoculation to severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice effectively reduced the extent of peritoneal disease and increased survival. Maraviroc treatment also reduced the tumor burden in a xenograft model. Gene expression and RT-PCR analyses revealed that CCR5 antagonism in vivo modulates the expression of genes known for their role in cancer growth including interleukin-10 receptor B; hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET); the homolog of the atypical cadherin gene, FAT1; Nm23-H1; and lymphotoxin \u03b2 receptor. In summary, we have shown that CCR5 is mechanistically involved in dissemination of gastric cancer cells, suggesting that small molecule inhibitors of CCR5 might be exploited for their anticancer potential.",

Vascular endothelial growth factor plays a critical role in vascular development in HCC. In contrast to the treatment of early-stage HCC, the treatment options for advanced HCC are limited and prognosis is often poor, which contributes to this tumor type being the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Metronomic chemotherapy, which was originally designed to inhibit angiogenesis, involves low-dose chemotherapeutic agents administered in a frequent regular schedule with no prolonged breaks and minimizes severe toxicities. We reviewed the potential effects and impact of metronomic chemotherapy in preclinical studies with HCC models and in patients with advanced HCC, especially when combined with a molecular targeted agent. Metronomic chemotherapy involves multiple mechanisms that include antiangiogenesis and antivasculogenesis, immune stimulation by reducing regulatory T cells and inducing dendritic cell maturation, and possibly some direct tumor cell targeting effects, including the cancer stem cell subpopulation. The total number of preclinical studies with HCC models shows impressive results using metronomic chemotherapy-based protocols, especially in conjunction with molecular targeted agents. Four clinical trials and two case reports evaluating metronomic chemotherapy for HCC indicate it to be a safe and potentially useful treatment for HCC. Several preclinical and clinical HCC studies suggest that metronomic chemotherapy may become an alternative type of chemotherapy for advanced unresectable HCC and postsurgical adjuvant treatment of HCC.",

METHODS: We identified all cases of resected stage III colon cancer from 1995 to 2009 managed in the Capital Health district of Nova Scotia. Tissue microarrays were constructed and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for tumor EphB2 staining assigned into quartiles. Microsatellite status was evaluated by IHC for MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) and MutS homolog 2 (MSH2). Microsatellite stable tumors were defined as both MLH1/MSH2 (+/+); tumors staining otherwise were classified with microsatellite instability (MSI-H). Primary and secondary outcomes were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. RESULTS: We identified 159 cases with sufficient tissue for microarray analysis having a median follow-up of 3.47 years (range, 0.14\u201314). Median age was 61, 52% were male, 40% had an event, and 29% died. MSI-H was present in 18 (13%). Univariate analysis of EphB2 expression on DFS and OS showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.00 (P = .01) and 2.14 (P = .03), respectively. Multivariate analysis of EphB2 expression on DFS and OS showed an HR of 2.24 and 2.23, respectively, with tumor IHC \u2264 50%.

This study aims to determine whether exposure to \u03b2-adrenoceptor blockers (BBs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) is associated with decreased mortality, tumor progression, number of hospitalizations, or weight loss in colorectal cancer. METHODS: Retrospective chart review included patients with advanced colorectal cancer. Survival, stage, hospitalization, cancer progression, cancer treatment, and body weight history were collected. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-two of 425 new stage III to IV colorectal cancer cases reviewed met the study criteria. Those exposed to ACEI/ARB, BB, or both were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and stage III colorectal cancer. Adjusting for age, presence of hypertension and diabetes, and stage, ACEI/ARB + BB exposure was associated with decreased mortality compared to unexposed individuals [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5, confidence interval (CI) = 0.29\u20130.85; Cox regression, P = .01]. Fewer total and cancer-related hospitalizations and decreased cancer progression in the ACEI/ARB + BB group versus the unexposed group (HR = 0.59, CI = 0.36\u20130.99, P = .047) were seen. Exposure did not affect weight changes; furthermore, body weight changes from both prediagnosis and at diagnosis to 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postdiagnosis predicted survival.

From altogether 220 million paired-end sequence reads from seven CRC cell lines, we identified 3391 candidate fused transcripts. By stringent requirements, we nominated 11 candidate fusion transcripts for further experimental validation, of which 10 were positive by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing. Six were intrachromosomal fusion transcripts, and interestingly, three of these, AKAP13-PDE8A, COMMD10-AP3S1, and CTB-35F21.1-PSD2, were present in, respectively, 18, 18, and 20 of 21 analyzed cell lines and in, respectively, 18, 61, and 48 (17%-58%) of 106 primary cancer tissues.

Our goal was to evaluate a voxel-based biomarker, the functional diffusion map (fDM), as an imaging biomarker to detect heterogeneity of tumor response in a radiation dose escalation protocol using a genetically engineered murine GBM model. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-four genetically engineered murine GBM models [Ink4a-Arf-/-/Ptenloxp/loxp/Ntv-a RCAS/PDGF(+)/Cre(+)] were randomized in four treatment groups (n = 6 per group) consisting of daily doses of 0, 1, 2, and 4 Gy delivered for 5 days. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired for tumor delineation and quantification of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, respectively. MRI experiments were performed daily for a week and every 2 days thereafter. For each animal, the area under the curve (AUC) of the percentage change of the ADC (AUCADC) and that of the increase in fDM values (AUCfDM+) were determined within the first 5 days following therapy initiation. RESULTS: Animal survival increased with increasing radiation dose. Treatment induced a dose-dependent increase in tumor ADC values. The strongest correlation between survival and ADC measurements was observed using the AUCfDM+ metric (R2 = 0.88). CONCLUSION: This study showed that the efficacy of a voxel-based imaging biomarker (fDM) was able to detect spatially varying changes in tumors, which were determined to be a more sensitive predictor of overall response versus whole-volume tumor measurements (AUCADC). Finally, fDM provided for visualization of treatment-associated spatial heterogeneity within the tumor.",

This study explored the role of pharmacokinetics, valency, and molecular weight in maximizing drug delivery. Biodistribution of a fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) targeting CovX-body (an FGFR4-binding peptide covalently linked to a nontargeting IgG scaffold; 150 kDa) and enzymatically generated FGFR4 targeting F(ab)2 (100 kDa) and Fab (50 kDa) fragments was measured. Peak tumor levels were achieved in 1 to 2 hours for Fab and F(ab)2versus 8 hours for IgG, and the percentage injected dose in tumors was 0.45%, 0.5%, and 2.5%, respectively, compared to 0.3%, 2%, and 6% of their nontargeting controls. To explore the contribution of multivalent binding, homodimeric peptides were conjugated to the different sized scaffolds, creating FGFR4 targeting IgG and F(ab)2 with four peptides and Fab with two peptides. Increased valency resulted in an increase in cell surface binding of the bivalent constructs. There was an inverse relationship between valency and intratumoral drug concentration, consistent with targeted consumption. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated increased size and increased cell binding decreased tumor penetration. The binding site barrier hypothesis suggests that limited tumor penetration, as a result of high-affinity binding, could result in decreased efficacy. In our studies, increased target binding translated into superior efficacy of the IgG instead, because of superior inhibition of FGFR4 proliferation pathways and dosing through the binding site barrier. Increasing valency is therefore an effective way to increase the efficacy of antibody-based drugs.",

Cell cycle regulatory (P = 9.23 \u00d7 10-73, 14.2% of altered genes, nearly universally downregulated) and DNA replication/repair (P = 6.86 \u00d7 10-30) genes were most prominent in LNCaP. Stress response and proliferation genes were altered in all cell lines. p53-activated genes were only induced in LNCaP. Differences in gene expression exist between cell lines and after varying irradiation regimens that are p53 dependent. As the duration of changes is \u226524 hours, it may be possible to use radiation-inducible targeted therapy to enhance the efficacy of molecular targeted agents.",

     "abstract": "AIM: Targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a potential means of overcoming chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. We investigated the capability of 18F-fluororodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) small-animal positron emission tomography (SA-PET) to predict the effects of a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor (BEZ-235) in a cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancer model. METHODS: In a first experiment, nude rats bearing subcutaneous SKOV3 tumors received BEZ-235 for 3 days given alone or after paclitaxel and were compared to controls (either untreated or that were given the excipients of paclitaxel and BEZ-235). SA-PET was performed at baseline, on day 3, and day 7. In a second experiment aiming at further exploring the kinetics of 18F-FDG tumor uptake during the first 48 hours following drug cessation, untreated controls were compared to rats receiving BEZ-235, which were imaged at baseline, on day 3, on day 4, and on day 5. SA-PET results were compared to cell proliferation assessment (Ki-67), PI3K/mTOR downstream target expression studies (pAKT and phospho-eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1), and apoptosis evaluation (cleaved caspase-3). RESULTS: In the first experiment, BEZ-235, compared to untreated controls, induced a marked decrease in 18F-FDG uptake on day 3, which was correlated to a significant decrease in cell proliferation and to a significant PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition. No tumor necrosis or apoptosis occurred. Four days following treatment cessation, tumor recovery (in terms of PI3K/mTOR inhibition and cell proliferation) occurred and was identified by 18F-FDG SA-PET. Paclitaxel plus BEZ-235 showed results similar to BEZ-235 alone. In the second experiment, PI3K/mTOR pathways exhibited partial recovery as early as 24 hours following treatment cessation, but both 18F-FDG SA-PET and cell proliferation remained unchanged. CONCLUSIONS:18F-FDG SA-PET is a surrogate marker of target inhibition during treatment with BEZ-235 and predicts tumor recovery 4 days after drug withdrawal, but not during the first 48 hours following drug cessation, when a lag between PI3K/mTOR pathway recovery and metabolic recovery is observed. 18F-FDG SA-PET could be used for therapy monitoring of PI3K/mTOR inhibitors, but our results also raise questions regarding the potential impact of the delay between PET imaging and the last drug intake on the accuracy of FDG imaging.",

     "abstract": "Intestinal commensal bacteria have recently been shown to trigger macrophages to produce diffusible clastogens (or chromosome-breaking factors) through a bystander effect (BSE) that mediates DNA damage and induces chromosomal instability in neighboring cells. Colon macrophages appear central to colon carcinogenesis and BSE through the expression of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). The former induces netrin-1, a regulator of intestinal epithelial cell apoptosis, and the latter generates trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), an endogenous mutagen. To test whether colon macrophages are key effectors for BSE, we depleted these cells in interleukin-10 knockout mice colonized with Enterococcus faecalis using encapsulated liposomal clodronate (ELC), a bisphosphonate that causes macrophage apoptosis. We observed that E. faecalis polarizes colon macrophages to an M1 phenotype. In addition, depleting these cells suppressed COX-2 and TNF-\u03b1, blocked the formation of 4-HNE protein adducts, and inhibited up-regulation of netrin-1\u2014all markers for BSE. Finally, treatment with ELC prevented colitis, \u03b2-catenin activation, and cancer formation. These results show that selected human commensals can polarize colon macrophages to the M1 phenotype and, when activated, serve as the key effector for bacterial-induced BSE. Our findings suggest that depleting M1-polarized macro-phages is a mechanism for the chemopreventive activity of bisphosphonates and that it represents a new strategy for preventing colon cancer induced by intestinal commensals.",

The potential of gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid-based dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in assessing the microenvironment and microenvironment-associated aggressiveness of cervical carcinomas was investigated in this preclinical study. CK-160 and TS-415 cervical carcinoma xenografts were used as tumor models. DCE-MRI was carried out at 1.5 T, and parametric images of Ktrans and ve were produced by pharmacokinetic analysis of the DCE-MRI series. Pimonidazole was used as a marker of hypoxia. A Millar catheter was used to measure tumor interstitial fluid pressure (IFP). The concentrations of glucose, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and lactate were measured by induced metabolic bioluminescence imaging. High incidence of lymph node metastases was associated with high hypoxic fraction and high lactate concentration in CK-160 tumors and with high IFP and high lactate concentration in TS-415 tumors. Low Ktrans was associated with high hypoxic fraction, low glucose concentration, and high lactate concentration in tumors of both lines and with high incidence of metastases in CK-160 tumors. Associations between ve and microenvironmental parameters or metastatic propensity were not detected in any of the tumor lines. Taken together, this preclinical study suggests that Ktrans is a potentially useful biomarker for poor outcome of treatment in advanced cervical carcinoma. The possibility that Ktrans may be used to identify patients with cervical cancer who are likely to benefit from particularly aggressive treatment merits thorough clinical investigations.",

     "abstract": "Human pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase 1) is a small secretory protein that catalyzes the cleavage of RNA. This highly cationic enzyme can enter human cells spontaneously but is removed rapidly from circulation by glomerular filtration. Here, this shortcoming is addressed by attaching a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) moiety to RNase 1. The pendant has no effect on ribonucleolytic activity but does increase persistence in circulation. The RNase 1-CPEG conjugates inhibit the growth of tumors in a xenograft mouse model of human lung cancer. Both retention in circulation and tumor growth inhibition correlate with the size of the pendant PEG. A weekly dose of the 60-kDa conjugate at 1 \u03bcmol/kg inhibited nearly all tumor growth without affecting body weight. Its molecular efficacy is ~5000-fold greater than that of erlotinib, which is a small molecule in clinical use for the treatment of lung cancer. These data demonstrate that the addition of a PEG moiety can enhance the in vivo efficacy of human proteins that act within cells and highlight a simple means of converting an endogenous human enzyme into a cytotoxin with potential clinical utility.",

Abnormalities in the tumor-associated lymph vessels are a central brick in the development and prolonged sustaining of an increased TIFP. In the current study, vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) was used to enhance tumor-associated lymphangiogenesis as a new mechanism to actively reduce the TIFP by increased lymphatic drainage of the tumor tissue. Human A431 epidermoid vulva carcinoma cells were inoculated in NMRI nu/nu mice to generate a xenograft mouse model. Seven days after tumor cell injection, VEGF-C was peritumorally injected to induce lymphangiogenesis. Tumor growth and TIFP was lowered significantly over time in VEGF-C-treated tumors in comparison to control or VEGF-A-treated animals. These data demonstrate for the first time that actively induced lymphangiogenesis can lower the TIFP in a xenograft tumor model and apparently reduce tumor growth. This model represents a novel approach to modulate biomechanical properties of the tumor interstitium enabling a lowering of TIFP in vivo.",

We have completed a comprehensive fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)-based screen for all 27 members of the ETS transcription factor family on two melanoma tissue microarrays, representing 223 melanomas, 10 nevi, and 5 normal skin tissues. None of the melanoma cases demonstrated ETS fusions; however, 6 of 114 (5.3%) melanomas were amplified for ETV1 using a break-apart FISH probe. For the six positive cases, locus-controlled FISH probes revealed that two of six cases were amplified for the ETV1 region, whereas four cases showed copy gains of the entire chromosome 7. The remaining 26 ETS family members showed no chromosomal aberrations by FISH. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed an average 3.4-fold (P value = .00218) increased expression of ETV1 in melanomas, including the FISH ETV1-amplified cases, when compared to other malignancies (prostate, breast, and bladder carcinomas).

Therefore, we investigated whether inhibition of SFK through dasatinib (DSB) can enhance the effect of radiotherapy in two in vivo human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) models. Response to DSB and/or radiotherapy was assessed with tumor growth delay assays in two HNSCC xenograft models, SCCNij153 and SCCNij202. Effects on EGFR signaling were evaluated withWestern blot analysis, and effects on DNA repair, hypoxia, and proliferation were investigated with immunohistochemistry. DSB and radiotherapy induced a significant growth delay in both HNSCC xenograft models, although to a lesser extent in SCCNij202. DSB did not inhibit phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) or phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (pERK1/2) but did inhibit (phosphorylated) DNA-dependent protein kinase. Moreover, DSB reduced repair of radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks as shown by an increase of p53-binding protein 1 (53BP1) staining 24 hours after radiation. This effect on DNA repair was only observed in the cell compartment where phosphorylated SFK (pSFK) was expressed: for SCCNij153 tumors in both normoxic and hypoxic areas and for SCCNij202 tumors only in hypoxic areas. No consistent effects of DSB on hypoxia or proliferation were observed. In conclusion, DSB enhances the effect of radiotherapy in vivo by inhibition of radiation-induced DNA repair and is a promising way to improve outcome in HNSCC patients.",

     "publication date": "08-2013",
     "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have been proposed as a monitoring tool in patients with solid tumors. So far, automated approaches are challenged by the cellular heterogeneity of CTC, especially the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Recently, Yu and colleagues showed that shifts in these cell populations correlated with response and progression, respectively, to chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer. In this study, we assessed which non-hematopoietic cell types were identifiable in the peripheral blood of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients and whether their distribution during treatment courses is associated with clinical characteristics. METHODS: Subsequent to few enrichment steps, cell suspensions were spun onto glass slides and further characterized using multi-immunofluorescence staining. All non-hematopoietic cells were counted and individual cell profiles were analyzed per patient and treatment. RESULTS:We detected a remarkable variation of cells with epithelial, mesenchymal, liver-specific, and mixed characteristics and different size ranges. The distribution of these subgroups varied significantly between different patient groups and was associated with therapeutic outcome. Kaplan-Meier logrank test showed that a change in the ratio of epithelial to mesenchymal cells was associated with longer median time to progression (1 vs 15 months; P = .03; hazard ratio = 0.18; 95%confidence interval = 0.01-2.75). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that different CTC populations are identifiable in peripheral blood of HCC patients and, for the first time in HCC, that these individual cell type profiles may have distinct clinical implications. The further characterization and analysis of patients in this ongoing study seems to be warranted.",

SNX2112 inhibited proliferation, induced G2/M block, and enhanced cytotoxicity, chemosensitivity, and radiosensitivity between 25 and 250 nM in vitro. SNX2112 showed combinatorial activity with paclitaxel in wild-type (wt) TP53-deficient and cisplatin in mutant (mt) TP53 HNSCC lines. SNX2112 decreased expression or phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), c-MET, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT), extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2, inhibitor \u00eaB kinase, and signal transducer and transcription factor 3 (STAT3), corresponding downstream nuclear factor \u00eaB, activator protein-1, and STAT3 reporter genes, and target oncogenes and angiogenic cytokines. Furthermore, SNX2112 enhanced re-expression of TP53 and targets p21WAF1 and PUMA, while TP53 inhibitor Pifithrin or siRNA attenuated the antiproliferative activity of SNX2112 in wtTP53 HNSCC in vitro. Prodrug SNX5422 similarly down-modulated key signal targets, enhanced TP53 expression and apoptosis, and inhibited proliferation, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis in a wtTP53-deficient HNSCC xenograft model. Thus, HSP90 inhibitor SNX5422/2112 broadly modulates multiple key nodes within the dysregulated signaling network, with corresponding effects upon the malignant phenotype.

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The full potential of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), in the treatment of unresectable intrahepatic malignancies, has yet to be realized as our experience is still limited. Thus, we evaluated SBRT outcomes for primary and metastatic liver tumors, with the goal of identifying factors that may aid in optimization of therapy. METHODS: From2005 to 2010, 62 patients with 106 primary and metastatic liver tumors were treated with SBRT to a median biologic effective dose (BED) of 100 Gy (42.6-180). The majority of patients received either three (47%) or five fractions (48%). Median gross tumor volume (GTV) was 8.8 cm3 (0.2-222.4). RESULTS: With a median followup of 18 months (0.46-46.8), freedom from local progression (FFLP) was observed in 97 of 106 treated tumors, with 1- and 2-year FFLP rates of 93% and 82%. Median overall survival (OS) for all patients was 25.2 months, with 1- and 2-year OS of 81%and 52%. Neither BED nor GTV significantly predicted for FFLP. Local failure was associated with a higher risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) = 5.1, P = .0007]. One Child-Pugh Class B patient developed radiationinduced liver disease. There were no other significant toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: SBRT provides excellent local control for both primary and metastatic liver lesions with minimal toxicity. Future studies should focus on appropriate selection of patients and on careful assessment of liver function to maximize both the safety and efficacy of treatment.",

     "abstract": "Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is strongly associated with poor prognosis in neuroblastoma (NB). In addition to MYCN amplification, many studies have focused on identifying patients with a poor prognosis based on gene expression profiling. The majority of prognostic signatures today are comprised of large gene lists limiting their clinical application. In addition, although of prognostic significance,most of these signatures fail to identify cellular processes that can explain their relation to prognosis. Here, we determined prognostically predictive genes in a data set containing 251 NBs. Gene Ontology analysis was performed on significant genes with a positive hazard ratio to search for cellular processes associated with poor prognosis. An enrichment in ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) was found. Genes involved in the stabilization and formation of the central small nucleolar RNP (snoRNP) complex were scrutinized using a backward conditional Cox regression resulting in an snoRNP signature consisting of three genes: DKC1, NHP2, and GAR1. The snoRNP signature significantly and independently predicted prognosis when compared to the established clinical risk factors. Association of snoRNP protein expression and prognosis was confirmed using tissue microarrays. Knockdown of snoRNP expression in NB cell lines resulted in reduced telomerase activity and an increase in anaphase bridge frequency. In addition, in patient material, expression of the snoRNP complex was significantly associated with telomerase activity, occurrence of segmental aberrations, and expression-based measurements of chromosomal instability. Together, these results underscore the prognostic value of snoRNP complex expression in NB and suggest a role for snoRNPs in telomere maintenance and genomic stability.",

Expression levels of DNA repair enzymes have been shown to predict the responsiveness of cancers to certain chemotherapeutic agents. The RECQ helicases repair damaged DNA including damage caused by topoisomerase I inhibitors, such as irinotecan. Altered expression levels of these enzymes in colorectal cancer (CRC) may influence the response of the cancers to irinotecan. Thus, we assessed RECQ helicase (WRN, BLM, RECQL, RECQL4, and RECQL5) expression in primary CRCs, matched normal colon, and CRC cell lines. We found that BLM and RECQL4 mRNA levels are significantly increased in CRC (P = .0011 and P < .0001, respectively), whereas RECQL and RECQL5 are significantly decreased (P = .0103 and P = .0029, respectively). RECQ helicase expression patterns varied between specific molecular subtypes of CRCs. The mRNA and protein expression of the majority of the RECQ helicases was closely correlated, suggesting that altered mRNA expression is the predominant mechanism for deregulated RECQ helicase expression. Immunohistochemistry localized the RECQ helicases to the nucleus. RECQ helicase expression is altered in CRC, suggesting that RECQ helicase expression has potential to identify CRCs that are susceptible to specific chemotherapeutic agents.",

     "abstract": "Past studies have shown that the inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase (PIB5PA), is commonly downregulated or lost in melanomas, which contributes to elevated activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt in melanoma cells. In this report, we provide evidence that PIB5PA deficiency plays a role in resistance of melanoma cells to RAF/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Ectopic expression of PIB5PA enhanced apoptosis induced by the RAF inhibitor PLX4720 in BRAFV600E and by the MEK inhibitor U0126 in both BRAFV600E and wild-type BRAF melanoma cells. This was due to inhibition of PI3K/Akt, as co-introduction of an active form of Akt (myr-Akt) abolished the effect of overexpression of PIB5PA on apoptosis induced by PLX4720 or U0126. While overexpression of PIB5PA triggered activation of Bad and down-regulation of Mcl-1, knockdown of Bad or overexpression of Mcl-1 recapitulated, at least in part, the effect of myr-Akt, suggesting that regulation of Bad and Mcl-1 is involved in PIB5PA-mediated sensitization of melanoma cells to the inhibitors. The role of PIB5PA deficiency in BRAF inhibitor resistance was confirmed by knockdown of PIB5PA, which led to increased growth of BRAFV600E melanoma cells selected for resistance to PLX4720. Consistent with its role in vitro, overexpression of PIB5PA and the MEK inhibitor selumetinib cooperatively inhibited melanoma tumor growth in a xenograft model. Taken together, these results identify loss of PIB5PA as a novel resistance mechanism of melanoma to RAF/MEK inhibitors and suggest that restoration of PIB5PA may be a useful strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of the inhibitors in the treatment of melanoma.",

Previous studies have shown that miR-92a has an oncogenic function in several cancers and that its up-regulation is correlated with malignant clinicopathologic behaviors of colorectal cancer. It also has been suggested that circulating miR-92a in patients' plasma can be a potential biomarker for colorectal cancer. However, the precise roles of intracellular and extracellular miR-92a are not yet understood. In this study, we examined the expression levels of miR-92a in colorectal tumors (38 cancer specimens and 56 adenoma specimens) and paired adjacent nontumorous tissues. Increased expression of miR-92a was frequently observed in the cancers compared with that in the adenomas and was correlated with advanced clinical stages, tumor depth, and size. We also demonstrated that the levels of miR-92a within microvesicles (MVs) in the plasma of mice bearing colon cancer xenografts were significantly increased compared with those in control mice. One of the roles of intracellular and extracellular miR-92a was shown to be down-regulation of Dickkopf-3 (Dkk-3), a presumed tumor suppressor gene. Within the colon cancer cells, suppression of Dkk-3 by miR-92a contributed to the cell proliferation. Extracellular miR-92a packed within MVs secreted by colon cancer cells was delivered into endothelial cells and contributed to the proliferation and motility of these cells through down-regulation of the same target gene, Dkk-3. These data suggest that intracellular and extracellular miR-92a had important roles in tumor growth and the tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer.",

Here, we have investigated the effect of prolonged therapy with oral metronomic topotecan and pazopanib on tumor behavior in a neuroblastoma mouse xenograft model. SK-N-BE(2) xenograft-bearing mice were treated with either of the following regimens (daily, orally): vehicle (control), 150 mg/kg pazopanib, 1.0 mg/kg topotecan, and combination of topotecan and pazopanib. Planned durations of treatment for each regimen were 28, 56, and 80 days or until the end point, after which animals were sacrificed. We found that only combination-treated animals survived until 80 days. Combination halted tumor growth for up to 50 days, after which gradual growth was observed. Unlike single agents, all three durations of combination significantly lowered microvessel densities compared to the control. However, the tumors treated with the combination for 56 and 80 days had higher pericyte coverage compared to control and those treated for 28 days. The proliferative and mitotic indices of combination-treated tumors were higher after 28 days of treatment and comparable after 56 days and 80 days of treatment compared to control. Immunohistochemistry,Western blot, and real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that combination treatment increased the hypoxia and angiogenic expression. Immunohistochemistry for Glut-1 and hexokinase II expression revealed a metabolic switch toward elevated glycolysis in the combination-treated tumors. We conclude that prolonged combination therapy with metronomic topotecan and pazopanib demonstrates sustained antiangiogenic activity but also incurs resistance potentially mediated by elevated glycolysis.",

Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect EGFR exon 20 mutations of patients with NSCLC after chemotherapy. The same is being analyzed with patients' characteristics. METHODS: Peripheral blood samples were collected from 273 patients with NSCLC, including 143 with adenocarcinoma (ADC) and 130 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), after chemotherapy. DNA was extracted from whole blood for nested PCR amplification and purification. Sequencing was carried out in an automated 3730 sequencer, followed by analysis of EGFR exon 20 mutations from nested PCR products. RESULTS: The mutations of EGFR exon 20 were mainly point mutations in rs1050171 (c.2361A>G) and rs56183713 (c.2457G>A). The point mutation was 28.21%, 28.46%, and 27.97% in patients with NSCLC, ADC and SCC, respectively. Men had an equivalent mutation (27.18%) to women (30.77%). The mutation in smokers and nonsmokers was 27.68% and 29.17%, respectively. In unselected patients, there was no correlation between EGFR exon 20 mutations and patients' characteristics of age, gender, smoking history, histologic type, or tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system. In subgroup analyses, the EGFR mutation of patients with SCC was correlated with TNM stage [P = .013; odds ratio = 1.758; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.125-2.747]. CONCLUSIONS: The data indicate that the chemotherapy may induce EGFR-TKI-resistant mutation in NSCLC cells and EGFR-TKI should be used in the early stage of NSCLC but not after chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Although angiogenesis has been proposed as a therapeutic target for the treatment of ovarian granulosa cell tumor (GCT), its potential has not been evaluated in controlled studies. To do so, we used the Ptentm1Hwu/tm1Hwu; Ctnnb1tm1Mmt/+;Amhr2tm3(cre)Bhr/+ (PCA) mouse model, which develops GCTs that mimic the advanced disease in women. A monoclonal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) antibody was administered weekly to PCA mice beginning at 3 weeks of age. By 6 weeks of age, anti-VEGFA therapy significantly decreased tumor weights relative to controls (P < .05) and increased survival, with all treated animals but none of the controls surviving to 8 weeks of age. Analyses of PCA tumors showed that anti-VEGFA treatment resulted in significant decreases in tumor cell proliferation and microvessel density relative to controls (P < .05). However, treatment did not have a significant effect on apoptosis or tumor necrosis. The VEGFA receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signaling effector p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), whose activity is associated with cell proliferation, was significantly less phosphorylated (i.e., activated) in tumors from the treated group (P < .05). Conversely, no significant difference was found in the activation of protein kinase B, a VEGFR2 signaling effector associated with cell survival. Together, these results suggest that anti-VEGFA therapy is effective at inhibiting GCT growth in the PCA model and acts by reducing microvascular density and cell proliferation through inhibition of the VEGFR2-MAPK pathway. Findings from this preclinical model therefore support the investigation of targeting VEGFA for the adjuvant treatment of GCT in women.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Conventional frequency quantitative ultrasound in conjunction with textural analysis techniques was investigated to monitor noninvasively the effects of cancer therapies in an in vivo preclinical model. METHODS: Conventional low-frequency (\u223c7 MHz) and high-frequency (\u223c20 MHz) ultrasound was used with spectral analysis, coupled with textural analysis on spectral parametric maps, obtained from xenograft tumor-bearing animals (n = 20) treated with chemotherapy to extract noninvasive biomarkers of treatment response. RESULTS: Results indicated statistically significant differences in quantitative ultrasound-based biomarkers in both low- and high-frequency ranges between untreated and treated tumors 12 to 24 hours after treatment. Results of regression analysis indicated a high level of correlation between quantitative ultrasound-based biomarkers and tumor cell death estimates from histologic analysis. Applying textural characterization to the spectral parametric maps resulted in an even stronger correlation (r2 = 0.97). CONCLUSION: The results obtained in this research demonstrate that quantitative ultrasound at a clinically relevant frequency can monitor tissue changes in vivo in response to cancer treatment administration. Using higher order textural information extracted from quantitative ultrasound spectral parametric maps provides more information at a high sensitivity related to tumor cell death.",

     "abstract": "Bladder cancer is the fifth most frequent tumor in men and ninth in women in the United States. Due to a high likelihood of recurrence, effective chemoprevention is a significant unmet need. Estrogen receptors (ERs), primarily ER\u03b2, are expressed in normal urothelium and urothelial carcinoma, and blocking ER function with selective ER modulators such as tamoxifen inhibits bladder cancer cell proliferation in vitro. Herein, the chemoprotective potential of tamoxifen was evaluated in female mice exposed to the bladder-specific carcinogen, N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN). Carcinogen treatment resulted in a 76% tumor incidence and increased mean bladder weights in comparison to controls. In contrast, mice receiving tamoxifen concurrent (8\u201320 weeks) or concurrent and subsequent (8\u201332 weeks) to BBN administration had no change in bladder weight and only 10% to 14% incidence of tumors. Non-muscle-invasive disease was present in animals treated with tamoxifen before (5\u20138 weeks) or after (20\u201332 weeks) BBN exposure, while incidence of muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma was reduced. ER\u03b2 was present in all mice and thus is a potential mediator of the tamoxifen chemoprotective effect. Surprisingly, ER\u03b1 expression, which was detected in 74% of the mice exposed to BBN alone but not in any controlmice, was correlated with tumor incidence, indicating a possible role for this receptor in carcinogen-induced urothelial tumorigenesis. Thus, these data argue that both ER\u03b1 and ER\u03b2 play a role in modulating carcinogen-induced bladder tumorigenesis. Administration of tamoxifen should be tested as a chemopreventive strategy for patients at high risk for bladder cancer recurrence.",

The proliferation/death rate was obtained using the number of tumor cells from the first two time points in conjunction with the logistic model of tumor growth, which was then used to predict tumor cellularity at the conclusion of NAC. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and the experimental number of tumor cells measured at the end of NAC was 0.81 (P = .0043). The proliferation rate estimated after the first cycle of therapy was able to separate patients who went on to achieve pathologic complete response from those who did not (P = .021) with a sensitivity and specificity of 82.4% and 72.7%, respectively.

To classify MB according to genetic features in practice, we analyzed 74 MBs using representative markers of each group. Based on immunohistochemistries (IHC), cytogenetic alterations, and a CTNNB1 mutation study, the patients were divided into the following three groups: cases showing nuclear \u03b2-catenin and/or CTNNB1 mutation and/or monosomy 6 were included in the WNT group (14/74, 18.9%); cases expressing GAB1 were included in the SHH group (15/74, 20.2%); cases that did not show positivity for markers of the WNT or SHH group were included in the non-WNT/SHH group (45/74, 60.6%). Immunoexpression of NPR3 seemed to lack sensitivity for classifying group 3, showing diffuse positivity in only two cases. KCNA1 was not specific to group 4 because it was expressed in all groups. Cases in the WNT group showed a slightly better survival than those in the SHH or non-WNT/SHH group, although additional cases are required for statistical significance. Isochromosome 17q (P = .002) and the large cell/anaplastic variant (P = .002) were demonstrated to be poor prognostic indicators in multivariate analysis. The representative IHC and cytogenetic data facilitated the division of MBs into the WNT and SHH groups; however, more specific markers should be added for the identification of group 3 and group 4 in practice.",

     "abstract": "Current in vivo models for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) have limitations in simulating some essential tumorigenic phenotypes, such as invasion. Most mouse models of human HNSCC are inadequate because tumor cells are injected directly into the connective tissue, thereby bypassing the basement membrane of the surface epithelium, the first barrier to invasion. In this manuscript, we establish the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay as an in vivomodel of human HNSCC tumor progression. Using the CAM model of HNSCC, we investigated the role of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a histone methyltransferase, in multiple aspects of HNSCC tumor progression. We found that knockdown of EZH2 reduced tumor size, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis of tumors produced by grafting human HNSCC cells onto the CAM. In addition, we demonstrate that EZH2 expression mediates a mesenchymal phenotype in HNSCC cell lines and mouse tumors. These findings demonstrate the advantages of the newly proposed CAM model of human HNSCC and highlight the emerging role of EZH2 in HSNCC tumor progression.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CRCC) is the most common malignant tumor of the kidney, and the clinical outcome of CRCC is related with the metastatic potential of CRCC. A significant proportion of metastatic CRCC remains incurable. Recently, immunotherapy against specific targets such as programmed death 1 (PD1) has been adapted for fatal cases of CRCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, we aimed to evaluate the potential of tumor-infiltrating PD1-positive lymphocytes or FoxP3-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs) as predictors of the metastatic potential or prognosis of CRCC and investigate possible correlations with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in 199 cases of CRCC. RESULTS: PD1 positivity, high Treg number, and EBV infection all predicted poor overall survival (OS) by univariate analysis. PD1 positivity and high Treg numbers were also significantly correlated with more distant metastatic relapse (DMR) and poor relapse-free survival (RFS) by univariate analysis. PD1 positivity and high Treg number were independent prognostic indicators for OS. In addition, PD1 positivity was an independent predictor of RFS and DMR. EBV infection was an independent predictor of OS of CRCC. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that intratumoral infiltration of PD1-positive or FoxP3-positive lymphocytes can be used as significant prognostic indicators of CRCC and PD1 positivity could be very helpful in the prediction of latent distant metastasis of CRCCs. Therefore, evaluation of the infiltration of PD-positive cells or Tregs in CRCC may be useful diagnostic tools for the selection of patients who could benefit from PD1- or Treg-based immunotherapy.",

We aimed to determine the usefulness of plasma mSEPT9 for screening CRC and gastric cancer (GC) and its diagnostic role in postoperative CRC patients. METHODS: A total of 350 peripheral blood samples from 101 CRC patients, 153 GC patients, and 96 healthy persons were collected. In addition, we obtained 35 follow-up blood samples from 27 CRC patients after curative radical surgery. Plasma mSEPT9, serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and serum CA19-9 were evaluated with clinicopathologic features. RESULTS: The sensitivity of plasma mSEPT9 was 36.6% for detecting CRC and 17.7% for detecting GC, and the specificity was 90.6%. During follow-up periods, mSEPT9 showed negative conversion in eight of nine CRC patients (88.9%) whose plasma mSEPT9 had been positive before radical surgery. The patients with plasma mSEPT9 had a tendency of presence of distant metastasis and lower disease-free survival in both CRC and GC. In GC patients, plasma mSEPT9 was more frequently observed in intestinal (23.5%) and mixed type (40.0%) than diffuse type (7.3%; P =.009). Combined analysis of mSEPT9, CEA, and CA19-9 increased the sensitivity for diagnosing GC to 32.7% (P = .002). CONCLUSION: Considering the high incidence of plasma mSEPT9 in intestinal or mixed type GCs similar to CRCs, GC should be examined through the plasma mSEPT9 screening test. In addition, plasma mSEPT9 is proposed as a follow-up marker in CRC patients, but further validation is required.",

DNA methylation of RAS-association domain family member 1 (RASSF1A), estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1), cadherin 1, type 1, E-cadherin (CDH1), TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 (TIMP3) and spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) genes was detected in the tumors of 124, 19, 15, 15, and 6 patients with mean levels of 48.45%, 3.81%, 2.36%, 27.55%, and 10.81%, respectively.

Attached to the AGO-OVAR2.11 study investigating the multityrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib in recurrent platinum refractory ovarian cancers, this translational research project assesses the potential value of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble VEGF receptor-3 (sVEGFR-3), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) levels for progression-free survival (PFS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Longitudinal serum samples were taken while the patient was on study drugs. Serum concentration of VEGF, sVEGFR-3, and Ang-2 was determined by ELISA. The slope of the markers was correlated to the PFS. RESULTS: Patients showing a decrease in VEGF concentration had a median PFS of 10.5 months [confidence interval (CI), 2.89\u201312.25] compared to 2.9 months (CI, 1.48\u20135.32) in the case of an increase (P = .17). The stratified log-rank test showed a trend for longer PFS if a decrease of Ang-2 was observed (P = .089). Dichotomized in absolute decrease or increase, the PFS was 8.4 months (CI, 2.89\u201312.26) versus 2.7 months (CI, 1.05\u20135.32), respectively. Patients with a reduction of the sVEGFR-3 concentration had a median PFS of 4.76 months (CI 2.86\u201310.65) versus 8.61 months (CI, 1.05-not estimable) in patients with an increase of sVEGFR-3. This observation was statistically not significant in the log-rank test (P = .81). CONCLUSION: Ang-2 could potentially identify a patient population that might have a better PFS when under anti-angiogenic treatment, like the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib.",

     "publication date": "06-2013",
     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant liver tumor, usually arises in the setting of liver cirrhosis (LC), and has a poor prognosis. The recently discovered Th2-cytokine interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a possible mediator in pancreatic and gastric carcinogeneses. IL-33 binds to its receptor and to soluble ST2 (sST2), which thereby acts as a regulator. The role of IL-33 and sST2 in HCC has not been elucidated yet. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study with 130 patients and 50 healthy controls (HCs). Sixty-five patients suffered from HCC and 65 patients had LC without HCC. We assessed serum IL-33 and sST2 levels and their association with established prognostic scores, liver function parameters, and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: No significant difference in IL-33 serum levels was found in HCC compared to LC and HCs. IL-33 levels did not correlate with OS, liver function parameters, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, or the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score. sST2 levels were significantly elevated in LC and HCC patients compared to HCs (P < .0001). Mean sST2 levels in LC were higher than in HCC (P < .0001), but a significant association with OS was only observed in the HCC group (P = .003). sST2 in HCC correlated with the CLIP score, the MELD score, and liver function parameters. CONCLUSION: In the present study, the serum concentration of sST2 was associated with OS of HCC. Therefore, sST2 may be considered as a new prognostic marker in HCC and is worth further evaluation.",

The limitation of this approach is in the identification of a target molecule present in sufficient concentration for visualization and the development of a labeling reagent that can penetrate tumor tissue with the fast kinetics required for use in a clinical setting. The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTP\u00b5 is a transmembrane protein that is continuously proteolyzed in the tumor microenvironment to generate a high concentration of extracellular fragment that can be recognized by the SBK2 probe. We conjugated the SBK2 peptide to a gadolinium chelate [SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3] to test whether the SBK2 probe could be developed as an MR molecular imaging probe. When intravenously injected into mice bearing flank tumors of human glioma cells, SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 labeled the tumors within 5 minutes with a high level of contrast for up to 2 hours post-injection. The contrast enhancement of SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 was significantly higher than that observed with a current MRI macrocyclic gadolinium chelate (Gadoteridol, ProHance) alone or a scrambled control. These results demonstrate that SBK2-Tris-(Gd-DOTA)3 labeling of the PTP\u00b5 extracellular fragment is a more specific MR molecular imaging probe than ProHance or a scrambled control. Consequently, the SBK2 probe may be more useful than the current gold standard reagent for MRI to identify tumors and to co-register tumor borders during surgical resection.",

     "publication date": "06-2013",
     "abstract": "PURPOSE: There is accumulating evidence that galanin receptors (GALRs) may be tumor suppressors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Promoter methylation status and gene expression were assessed in a large panel of primary tumors, based on the hypothesis that CpG hypermethylation might silence the galanin gene. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Galanin expression was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The methylation status of the galanin promoter was studied using bisulfate sequencing and methylation-specific PCR. UM-SCC-54 was stably transfected to express galanin. RESULTS: Galanin expression was absent in 3/12 (25.0%) UM-SCC cell lines, whereas three nonmalignant cell lines had stable expression. Galanin methylation was found in 24/100 (24.0%) cases. HNSCC tumor specimens was significantly correlated with the GALR1 methylation status (P = 1.88E-06). The presence of galanin promoter hypermethylation was statistically correlated with a decrease in disease-free survival (log-rank test, P = 6.02E-05). A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that methylation of galanin and methylation of the gene pair galanin and GALR1 had an odds ratio for recurrence of 8.95 [95% confidence interval (CI), 2.29\u201335.03] and 23.84 (95% CI, 2.74\u2013207.17), respectively. UM-SCC-54 cells that are GALR1-proficient but have hypermethylated galanin exhibited suppressed cell proliferation following exogenous expression of galanin. CONCLUSIONS: Association of frequent promoter hypermethylation and gene silencing with poor survival, combined with growth suppression of HNSCC cells after forced gene expression, supports the hypothesis that galanin acts as a tumor suppressor. These data suggest that galanin and GALR1 are potential therapeutic targets and prognostic factors.",

Few studies have employed these methods to study cancer cells because proliferative iron-labeled cancer cells will lose the label as they divide. In this study, we evaluate the potential for retention of the iron nanoparticle label, and resulting MRI signal, to serve as a marker for slowly dividing cancer cells. Green fluorescent protein-transfected MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were labeled with red fluorescent micron-sized superparamagnetic iron oxide (MPIO) nanoparticles. Cells were examined in vitro at multiple time points after labeling by staining for iron-labeled cells and by flow cytometric detection of the fluorescent MPIO. Severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) mice were implanted with 5 x 105 MPIO-labeled or unlabeled cells in the mammary fat pad and MRI was performed weekly until 28 days after injection. Microscopy was performed to validate MRI. In vitro assays revealed a very small percentage of cells that retained MPIO at 14 days after labeling. Regions of signal loss were observed in MRI of primary tumors that developed from iron-labeled cancer cells. Small focal regions of signal loss were detected in images of the axillary and brachial nodes in six of eight mice, at day 14 or later, with microscopy confirming the presence of iron-labeled cancer cells. Our data suggest an interesting role for cell tracking with iron particles since label retention leads to persistent signal void, allowing proliferative status to be determined.",

The goal of this study was to compare the radiosensitizing activities of the allosteric mTOR inhibitor rapamycin with that of the competitive mTOR inhibitor PP242. On the basis of immunoblot analyses, whereas rapamycin only partially inhibited mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity and had no effect on mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), PP242 inhibited the activity of both mTOR-containing complexes. Irradiation alone had no effect on mTORC1 or mTORC2 activity. Clonogenic survival was used to define the effects of the mTOR inhibitors on in vitro radiosensitivity. In the two tumor cell lines evaluated, PP242 treatment 1 hour before irradiation increased radiosensitivity, whereas rapamycin had no effect. Addition of PP242 after irradiation also enhanced the radiosensitivity of both tumor lines. To investigate the mechanism of radiosensitization, the induction and repair of DNA double-strand breaks were evaluated according yH2AX foci. PP242 exposure did not influence the initial level of yH2AX foci after irradiation but did significantly delay the dispersal of radiationinduced yH2AX foci. In contrast to the tumor cell lines, the radiosensitivity of a normal human fibroblast cell line was not influenced by PP242. Finally, PP242 administration to mice bearing U251 xenografts enhanced radiationinduced tumor growth delay. These results indicate that in a preclinical tumor model PP242 enhances tumor cell radiosensitivity both in vitro and in vivo and suggest that this effect involves an inhibition of DNA repair.",

In total DLBCL patients, DBC1 and AR expression were significantly associated with high clinical stage, elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, and high international prognostic index scores, and they predicted shorter overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) by univariate analysis. DBC1 expression was also an independent prognostic indicator by multivariate analysis (OS, P = .017; RFS, P = .004). Especially, both DBC1 and AR expression significantly correlated with shorter OS and RFS in non-germinal center B cell (non-GCB)-type DLBCL by univariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, DBC1 expression was an independent prognostic predictor for OS (P = .035) and AR expression significantly correlated with RFS (P = .005). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that the expression of DBC1 and AR are significant prognostic indicators for DLBCL patients, especially for unfavorable non-GCB-type DLBCL.",

     "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) provides a specialized environment for the folding and modification of trans-membrane proteins, including receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which are vital for the growth and survival of malignancies. To identify compounds which disrupt the function of the ER and thus could potentially impair cancer cell survival signaling, we adapted a set of glycosylation-sensitive luciferase reporters for the development and optimization of a cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS). Secondary screens for false-positive luciferase activation and tertiary lectin-based and biochemical analyses were also devised for compound triage. Through a pilot screen of 2802 compounds from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) chemical libraries, we identified aclacinomycin (Acm) as a compound that preferentially affects ER function. We report that Acm reduces plasma membrane expression of glycoproteins including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Met but does not inhibit N-linked glycosylation or generalized protein translation. Fluorescence microscopy co-localization experiments were also performed and demonstrated Acm accumulation in the ER in further support of the overall HTS design. The consequences of Acm treatment on cell survival were analyzed through clonogenic survival analysis. Consistent with the reduction of EGFR levels, pretreatment with Acm sensitizes the EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines HCC827 and HCC2935 to ionizing radiation and did not affect the sensitivity of the RTK-independent and KRAS-mutant A549 NSCLC cell line. Thus, Acm and similar compounds targeting the ER may represent a novel approach for radiosensitizing tumor cells dependent on RTK function.",

On the basis of a literature search, the potential serum markers neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (LCN2), metallopeptidase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 16 (CXCL16), IGFBP4, and iC3a, which were first tested in transgenic KrasLSL.G12D/+;p53R172H/+;Pdx1-Cre mice, were identified.

Identifying agents that target these cells will advance the development of more effective therapies. Recent converging evidence shows that c-Met expression marks tumor-initiating stem-like cells and that c-Met signaling drives human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cell stemness in vitro. However, the degree to which tumor-propagating stem-like cells depend on c-Met signaling in histologically complex cancers remains unknown. We examined the effects of in vivo c-Met pathway inhibitor therapy on tumor-propagating stem-like cells in human GBM xenografts. Animals bearing pre-established tumor xenografts expressing activated c-Met were treated with either neutralizing anti- hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) monoclonal antibody L2G7 or with the c-Met kinase inhibitor PF2341066 (Crizotinib). c-Met pathway inhibition inhibited tumor growth, depleted tumors of sphere-forming cells, and inhibited tumor expression of stem cell markers CD133, Sox2, Nanog, and Musashi. Withdrawing c-Met pathway inhibitor therapy resulted in a substantial rebound in stem cell marker expression concurrent with tumor recurrence. Cells derived from xenografts treated with anti-HGF in vivo were depleted of tumor-propagating potential as determined by in vivo serial dilution tumor-propagating assay. Furthermore, daughter xenografts that did form were 12-fold smaller than controls. These findings show that stem-like tumor-initiating cells are dynamically regulated by c-Met signaling in vivo and that c-Met pathway inhibitors can deplete tumors of their tumor-propagating stem-like cells.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly cancer that possesses an intrinsic resistance to pro-apoptotic insults, such as conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and diffusely invades the brain parenchyma, which renders it elusive to total surgical resection. We found that fusicoccin A, a fungal metabolite from Fusicoccum amygdali, decreased the proliferation and migration of human GBM cell lines in vitro, including several cell lines that exhibit varying degrees of resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli. The data demonstrate that fusicoccin A inhibits GBM cell proliferation by decreasing growth rates and increasing the duration of cell division and also decreases two-dimensional (measured by quantitative video microscopy) and three-dimensional (measured by Boyden chamber assays) migration. These effects of fusicoccin A treatment translated into structural changes in actin cytoskeletal organization and a loss of GBM cell adhesion. Therefore, fusicoccin A exerts cytostatic effects but low cytotoxic effects (as demonstrated by flow cytometry). These cytostatic effects can partly be explained by the fact that fusicoccin inhibits the activities of a dozen kinases, including focal adhesion kinase (FAK), that have been implicated in cell proliferation and migration. Overexpression of FAK, a nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinase, directly correlates with the invasive phenotype of aggressive human gliomas because FAK promotes cell proliferation and migration. Fusicoccin A led to the down-regulation of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation, which occurred in both normoxic and hypoxic GBM cell culture conditions. In conclusion, the current study identifies a novel compound that could be used as a chemical template for generating cytostatic compounds designed to combat GBM.",

Thus, hampering the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 cross talk by a CXCR4 antagonist like Plerixafor (AMD3100) should overcome tumor cell dormancy bymobilization of tumor cells from \u201csanctuary\u201d niches. Our aim was to elucidate the direct effects exerted by SDF-1\u03b1 and Plerixafor on proliferation, chemosensitivity, and apoptosis of CXCR4-expressing tumor cells. METHODS: The ability of SDF-1\u03b1 and Plerixafor to regulate intracellular signaling, proliferation, and invasion was investigated using two colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and SW480) with either high endogenous or lentiviral expression of CXCR4 compared to their respective low CXCR4-expressing counterparts as a model system. Efficacy of Plerixafor on sensitivity of these cell lines against 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan, or oxaliplatin was determined in a cell viability assay as well as stroma-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays. RESULTS: SDF-1\u03b1 increased proliferation, invasion, and ERK signaling of endogenously and lentivirally CXCR4-expressing cells. Exposure to Plerixafor reduced proliferation, invasion, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling. Combination of chemotherapy with Plerixafor showed an additive effect on chemosensitivity and apoptosis in CXCR4-overexpressing cells. An SDF-1-secreting feeder layer provideda\u201cprotective niche\u201d for CXCR4-overexpressing cells resulting in decreased chemosensitivity.

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: The inherent treatment resistance of glioblastoma (GBM) can involve multiple mechanisms including checkpoint kinase (Chk1/2)-mediated increased DNA repair capability, which can attenuate the effects of genotoxic chemotherapies and radiation. The goal of this study was to evaluate diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) as a biomarker for Chk1/2 inhibitors in combination with radiation for enhancement of treatment efficacy in GBM. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We evaluated a specific small molecule inhibitor of Chk1/2, AZD7762, in combination with radiation using in vitro human cell lines and in vivo using a genetically engineered GBM mouse model. DW-MRI and T1-contrast MRI were used to follow treatment effects on intracranial tumor cellularity and growth rates, respectively. RESULTS: AZD7762 inhibited clonal proliferation in a panel of GBM cell lines and increased radiosensitivity in p53-mutated GBM cell lines to a greater extent compared to p53 wild-type cells. In vivo efficacy of AZD7762 demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on GBM tumor growth rate and a reduction in tumor cellularity based on DW-MRI scans along with enhancement of radiation efficacy. CONCLUSION: DW-MRI was found to be a useful imaging biomarker for the detection of radiosensitization through inhibition of checkpoint kinases. Chk1/2 inhibition resulted in antiproliferative activity, prevention of DNA damage-induced repair, and radiosensitization in preclinical GBM tumor models, both in vitro and in vivo. The effects were found to be maximal in p53-mutated GBM cells. These results provide the rationale for integration of DW-MRI in clinical translation of Chk1/2 inhibition with radiation for the treatment of GBM.",

Besides its ability to block histone deacetylases (HDACs) by promoting histone hyperacetylation, panobinostat interferes with several cell death pathways providing a potential efficacy against tumors. We have previously demonstrated that panobinostat has a potent apoptotic activity in vitro and causes a significant growth delay of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumor xenografts in nude mice models. Here, we show that treatment with panobinostat is able to induce noncanonical apoptotic cell death in HepG2 and in Hep3B cells, involving the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by up-regulation of the molecular chaperone binding immunoglobulin protein/glucose-regulated protein 78, activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1-activating transcription factor 4 (tax-responsive enhancer element B67) and inositol requiring 1\u03b1-X-box binding protein 1 factors, strong increase and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein/growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153, and involvement of c-Jun N-terminal kinase. These signaling cascades culminate into the activation of the ER-located caspase-4/12 and of executioner caspases, which finally lead to cell demise.

The documented expression of several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) by these tumors makes them attractive targets for therapeutic intervention using tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, we possess limited knowledge of the effects of TKIs on hemangiosarcoma as well as other soft tissue sarcomas. We report here on the use of the TKIs imatinib and dasatinib in canine hemangiosarcoma and their effects on platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b2 (PDGFR-\u03b2) and Src inhibition. Both TKIs reduced cell viability, but dasatinib was markedly more potent in this regard, mediating cytotoxic effects orders of magnitude greater than imatinib. Dasatinib also inhibited the phosphorylation of the shared PDGFR-\u03b2 target at a concentration approximately 1000 times less than that needed by imatinib and effectively blocked Src phosphorylation. Both inhibitors augmented the response to doxorubicin, suggesting that clinical responses likely will be improved using both drugs in combination; however, dasatinib was significantly (P < .05) more effective in this context. Despite the higher concentrations needed in cell-based assays, imatinib significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < .05) in a tumor xenograft model, highlighting that disruption of PDGFR-\u03b2/PDGF signaling may be important in targeting the angiogenic nature of these tumors. Treatment of a dog with spontaneously occurring hemangiosarcoma established that clinically achievable doses of dasatinib may be realized in dogs and provides a means to investigate the effect of TKIs on soft tissue sarcomas in a large animal model.",

The present study explores the impact of inhibitor and IR schedule on the radiosensitizing ability of NVP-BEZ235 in four human glioblastoma cell lines. Two different drug-IR treatment schedules were compared. In schedule I, cells were treated with NVP-BEZ235 for 24 hours before IR and the drug was removed before IR. In schedule II, the cells were exposed to NVP-BEZ235 1 hour before, during, and up to 48 hours after IR. The cellular response was analyzed by colony counts, expression of marker proteins of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, cell cycle, and DNA damage. We found that under schedule I, NVP-BEZ235 did not radiosensitize cells, which were mostly arrested in G1 phase during IR exposure. In addition, the drug-pretreated and irradiated cells exhibited less DNA damage but increased expressions of phospho-AKT and phospho-mTOR, compared to controls. In contrast, NVP-BEZ235 strongly enhanced the radiosensitivity of cells treated according to schedule II. Possible reasons of radiosensitization by NVP-BEZ235 under schedule II might be the protracted DNA repair, prolonged G2/M arrest, and, to some extent, apoptosis. In addition, the PI3K pathway was downregulated by the NVP-BEZ235 at the time of irradiation under schedule II, as contrasted with its activation in schedule I. We found that, depending on the drug-IR schedule, the NVP-BEZ235 can act either as a strong radiosensitizer or as a cytostatic agent in glioblastoma cells.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs are endogenous posttranscriptional modulators that negatively control the expression of their target genes and play an important role in the development and progression of many malignancies, including colorectal carcinoma. In particular, expression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) is greatly increased in chemotherapy-resistant (CR) colon cancer cells that are enriched in undifferentiated cancer stem/stem-like cells (CSCs/CSLCs). We hypothesize that miR-21 plays a critical role in regulating differentiation of CR colon cancer cells. Indeed, we observed that downregulation of miR-21 in CR colon cancer cells (HCT-116 or HT-29) by antisense miR-21 induced differentiation, as evidenced by marked increases in cytokeratin-20 (CK-20) expression and alkaline phosphatase activity. These changes were accompanied by a significant reduction in the expression of colon CSC/CSLC marker CD44, colonosphere formation, and T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor (TCF/LEF) activity but increased the expression of proapoptotic programmed cell death 4 gene. Induction of differentiation greatly increased sensitivity of CR colon cancer cells to the growth inhibitory properties of all three regimens tested: 5-fluorouracil + oxaliplatin (FUOX), difluorinated curcumin (CDF), and the combination of CDF and FUOX. However, the magnitude of inhibition of growth by either CDF (75%) alone or CDF + FUOX (80%) was much higher than that observed with only FUOX (40%). Growth inhibition by CDF and CDF + FUOX in differentiating CR colon cancer cells was associated with a 98% to 99% reduction in the expression of CD44 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). However, down-regulation of CK-20 in CR colon cancer cells produced no significant change in cellular growth in the absence or presence of FUOX, when compared with the corresponding controls. The current observation suggests that CDF and CDF + FUOX are highly effective in inhibiting growth and reducing colon CSCs/CSLCs in anti-miR-21-induced differentiating CR colon cancer cells and supports our contention that differentiation enhances susceptibility of CR cancer cells to conventional and nonconventional therapeutic regimen.",

In the present work, the biologic effect of the drugs was screened by viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration, and invasion in vitro assays or in vivo by chick chorioallantoic membrane assay. Intracellular signaling was assessed by Western blot and the RTK targets were identified using phospho-RTK arrays. The amplified status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR2 genes was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In a panel of 10 glioblastoma cell lines, we showed that cediranib was the most potent. In addition, cediranib and sunitinib synergistically sensitize the cells to temozolomide. Cediranib efficacy was shown to associate with higher cytostatic and unique cytotoxic effects in vitro and both antitumoral and antiangiogenic activity in vivo, which could associate with its great capacity to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and AKT pathways. The molecular status of KIT, PDGFRA, and VEGFR2 did not predict glioblastoma cell responsiveness to any of the RTK inhibitors. Importantly, phospho-RTK arrays revealed novel targets for cediranib and sunitinib therapy. In conclusion, the novel targets found may be of value as future biomarkers for therapy response in glioblastoma and lead to the rational selection of patients for effective molecular targeted treatment.",

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the MAPK pathway regulates Notch signaling and that Notch signaling plays a role in PTC cell proliferation. Conditional induction of MAPK signaling oncogenes RET/PTC3 or BRAFT1799A in normal rat thyroid cell line mediated activation of Notch signaling, upregulating Notch1 receptor and Hes1, the downstream effector of Notch pathway. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of MAPK reduced Notch signaling in PTC cell. Thyroid tumor samples from transgenic mice expressing BRAFT1799A and primary human PTC samples showed high levels of Notch1 expression. Down-regulation of Notch signaling by \u03b3-secretase inhibitor (GSI) or NOTCH1 RNA interference reduces PTC cell proliferation. Moreover, the combination of GSI with a MAPK inhibitor enhanced the growth suppression in PTC cells. This study revealed that RET/PTC and BRAFT1799A activate Notch signaling and promote tumor growth in thyroid follicular cell. Taken together, these data suggest that Notch signaling may be explored as an adjuvant therapy for thyroid papillary cancer.",

We also examined the effects of FAK inhibition upon hepatoblastoma cells using a number of parallel approaches to block FAK including RNAi and small molecule FAK inhibitors. FAK inhibition resulted in decreased cellular survival, invasion, and migration and increased apoptosis. Further, small molecule inhibition of FAK led to decreased tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft model of hepatoblastoma.

     "abstract": "The signaling mediated by the chemokine receptor CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2) plays an important role in promoting the progression of many cancers, including pancreatic cancer, one of the most lethal human malignancies. CXCR2 possesses a consensus PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1 (PDZ) motif at its carboxyl termini, which might interact with potential PDZ scaffold/adaptor proteins. We have previously reported that CXCR2 PDZ motif-mediated protein interaction is an important regulator for neutrophil functions. Here, using a series of biochemical assays, we demonstrate that CXCR2 is physically coupled to its downstream effector phospholipase C-\u03b23 (PLC-\u03b23) that is mediated by PDZ scaffold protein Na+/H+ exchange regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) into a macromolecular signaling complex both in vitro and in pancreatic cancer cells. We also observe that disrupting the CXCR2 complex, by gene delivery or peptide delivery of exogenous CXCR2 C-tail, significantly inhibits the biologic functions of pancreatic cancer cells (i.e., proliferation and invasion) in a PDZ motif-dependent manner. In addition, using a human pancreatic tumor xenograft model, we show that gene delivery of CXCR2 C-tail sequence (containing the PDZ motif) by adeno-associated virus type 2 viral vector potently suppresses human pancreatic tumor growth in immunodeficient mice. In summary, our results suggest the existence of a physical and functional coupling of CXCR2 and PLC-\u03b23 mediated through NHERF1, forming a macromolecular complex that is critical for efficient and specific CXCR2 signaling in pancreatic cancer progression. Disrupting this CXCR2 complex could represent a novel and effective treatment strategy against pancreatic cancer.",

To investigate the complex molecular changes occurring during resistance formation, we performed a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the resistant tumors in vivo. We observed a multitude of differentially expressed genes, e.g., PAS domain containing protein 1, annexin A3 (ANXA3), neurotensin, or plasminogen activator tissue (PLAT), when comparing resistant to in vivo passaged tumor samples. Furthermore, tumor cells from in vivo and in vitro conditions showed a significant difference in target gene expression. We assigned the differentially expressed genes to functional pathways like axon guidance, steroid biosynthesis, and complement and coagulation cascades. Most of these genes were involved in anti-coagulation. Up-regulation of anticoagulatory ANXA3 and PLAT and down-regulation of PLAT inhibitor serpin peptidase inhibitor clade A were validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. In contrast, coagulation factor F3 was upregulated, accompanied by the expression of an altered gene product.

RESULT: Complete concordance between IHC and FISH results on biopsy versus surgical samples was noted in 80% and 95% of cases, respectively. At comprehensive comparison, including IHC and FISH data on biopsy and surgical samples, 89% of biopsies were predictive of HER2 status in surgical samples, whereas 11% showed variable inconsistencies.

The percentage of cases, which were FISH amplified with IHC score 1+ or 2+ on biopsies, were similar (25% and 33%, respectively) and they also shared a similar grade of amplification. These data suggest that both IHC score 1+ and 2+ on biopsy material represent \u201cequivocal cases\u201d that may merit further investigation. CONCLUSIONS: The predictive value of HER2 IHC in biopsies is high. FISH analysis should be considered for IHC score 2+ and 1+ biopsy cases. Approximately 8% of cases will not be accurately predicted by biopsy evaluation.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Ultrasound elastography is a new imaging technique that can be used to assess tissue stiffness. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of ultrasound elastography for monitoring treatment response of locally advanced breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant therapy. METHODS: Fifteen women receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy had the affected breast scanned before, 1, 4, and 8 weeks following therapy initiation, and then before surgery. Changes in elastographic parameters related to tissue biomechanical properties were then determined and compared to clinical and pathologic tumor response after mastectomy. RESULTS: Patients who responded to therapy demonstrated a significant decrease (P < .05) in strain ratios and strain differences 4 weeks after treatment initiation compared to non-responding patients. Mean strain ratio and mean strain difference for responders was 81 \u00b1 3% and 1 \u00b1 17% for static regions of interest (ROIs) and 81 \u00b1 3% and 6 \u00b1 18% for dynamic ROIs, respectively. In contrast, these parameters were 102\u00b12%, 110\u00b117%, 101\u00b14%, and 109\u00b130% for non-responding patients, respectively. Strain ratio using static ROIs was found to be the best predictor of treatment response, with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity obtained 4 weeks after starting treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that ultrasound elastography can be potentially used as an early predictor of tumor therapy response in breast cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "In this study, we attempt to target the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells using a recombinant anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx). LeTx consists of protective antigen (PrAg) and lethal factor (LF). PrAg binds cells, is cleaved by furin, oligomerizes, binds three to four molecules of LF, and undergoes endocytosis, releasing LF into the cytosol. LF cleaves MAPK kinases, inhibiting the MAPK pathway. We tested potency of LeTx on a panel of 11 human AML cell lines. Seven cell lines showed cytotoxic responses to LeTx. Cytotoxicity of LeTx was mimicked by the specific mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitor U0126, indicating that LeTx-induced cell death is mediated through the MEK1/2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) branch of the MAPK pathway. The four LeTx-resistant cell lines were sensitive to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. Co-treatment of AML cells with both LeTx and LY294002 did not lead to increased sensitivity, showing a lack of additive/synergistic effects when both pathways are inhibited. Flow cytometry analysis of MAPK pathway activation revealed the presence of phospho-ERK1/2 only in LeTx-sensitive cells. Staining for Annexin V/propidium iodide and active caspases showed an increase in double-positive cells and the absence of caspase activation following treatment, indicating that LeTx-induced cell death is caspase-independent and nonapoptotic. We have shown that a majority of AML cell lines are sensitive to the LF-mediated inhibition of the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that LeTx-induced cytotoxicity in AML cells is nonapoptotic and dependent on phospho-ERK1/2 levels.",

An optically detectable analogue of choline (propargyl choline) was synthesized and evaluated in 2D and 3D models and clinically isolated paired biopsies (n = 22 biopsies). Fluorescence contrast between clinically abnormal and normal tissues based on uptake and intracellular retention of propargyl choline was measured and correlated with pathologic diagnosis. Results in 2D and 3D models demonstrated a rapid uptake of propargyl choline in cancer cells, uniform permeation in tissue models, and specific detection of intracellular entrapped propargyl choline using the click chemistry reaction with an azide-modified Alexa 488 dye. Fluorescence imaging measurements following topical delivery of propargyl choline in clinically isolated biopsies showed that the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of neoplastic tissues was four-fold to five-fold higher than the MFI of clinically and pathologically normal samples. This difference in fluorescence contrast was measured on the basis of comparison of paired biopsy sets isolated from individual patients as well as comparison of clinically abnormal and normal biopsies independent of anatomic locations in the head and neck cavity and across diverse patients. In conclusion, a novel imaging approach based on monoalkyne-modified choline was developed and validated using cell and tissue models. Results in clinically isolated tissue biopsies demonstrate a significant fluorescent contrast between neoplastic and normal tissues and illustrate high specificity of the optical imaging approach.",

To test this hypothesis, we compared the responses of rodent hepatic and subcutaneous engrafts of rhabdomyosarcoma-1 (R1) to a vascular disrupting agent Combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P). METHODS: Twelve WAG/Rij rats, each bearing three R1 implanted in the right and left hepatic lobes and subcutaneously in the thoracic region, received CA4P intravenously at 5 mg/kg (n = 6) or solvent (n = 6). Therapeutic responses were compared interindividually and intraindividually among tumors of different sites till 48 hours after injection using in vivo MRI, postmortem digital microangiography, and histopathology. RESULTS: MRI revealed that the subcutaneous tumors (STs) significantly increased in volume than hepatic tumors (HTs) 48 hours after CA4P (P < .05). Relative to vehicle controls and treated group at baseline, necrosis ratio, apparent diffusion coefficient, and enhancement ratio changed slightly with the STs but significantly with HTs (P < .05) after CA4P treatment. Vessel density derived from microangiography was significantly lower in STs compared to HTs without CA4P treatment. CA4P treatment resulted in decreased vessel density in HTs, while it did not affect vessel density in STs. MRI and microangiography outcomes were supported by histopathologic findings. CONCLUSIONS: MRI and microangiography allowed quantitative comparison of therapeutic responses to CA4P in rats with multifocal tumors. The discovered diverse effects of the same drug on tumors of the same origin but different locations emphasize the presence of cancer heterogeneity and the importance of individualization of drug delivery.",

This resulted in the identification and molecular characterization of different subpopulations of CTCs in the same patient. Three-dimensional (3D) telomeric analysis was carried out on isolated CTCs of 19 patients that consisted of four different tumor types, namely, prostate, colon, breast, melanoma, and one lung cancer cell line. With telomeric analysis of the filter-isolated CTCs, the level of chromosomal instability (CIN) of the CTCs can be determined. Our study shows that subpopulations of CTCs can be identified on the basis of their 3D telomeric properties.",

     "abstract": "In the context of radiotherapy, collateral effects of ablative doses of ionizing radiation (AIR) on stromal components of tumors remains understudied. In this work, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from freshly resected human lung tumors were exposed to AIR (1x 18 Gy) and analyzed for their release of paracrine factors. Inflammatory mediators and regulators of angiogenesis and tumor growth were analyzed by multiplex protein assays in conditioned medium (CM) from irradiated and non-irradiated CAFs. Additionally, the profile of secreted proteins was examined by proteomics. In functional assays, effects of CAF-CM on proliferative and migratory capacity of lung tumor cells (H-520/H-522) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and their tube-forming capacity were assessed. Our data show that exposure of CAFs to AIR results in 1) downregulated release of angiogenic molecules such as stromal cell-derived factor-1, angiopoietin, and thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2); 2) upregulated release of basic fibroblast growth factor from most donors; and 3) unaffected expression levels of hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. CM from irradiated and control CAFs did not affect differently the proliferative or migratory capacity of tumor cells (H-520/H-522), whereas migratory capacity of HUVECs was partially reduced in the presence of irradiated CAF-CM. Overall, we conclude that AIR mediates a transformation on the secretory profile of CAFs that could influence the behavior of other cells in the tumor tissue and hence guide therapeutic outcomes.

The molecular and cellular machinery studies showed that GL3 functions as a topoisomerase II (Top 2) poison through direct binding to the enzyme, and the advanced cell-killing activities of GL3 were ascribed to its potent effects on trapping Top 2-DNA cleavage complex, Moreover, GL3-triggered DNA double-strand breaks and apoptotic cell death were in a Top 2-dependent manner, because the catalytic inhibitor aclarubicin attenuated these biologic consequences caused by Top 2 poisoning in GL3-treated cells. Taken together, among a series of 4\u03b2-anilino-4\u2032-O-demethyl-4-desoxypodophyllotoxin analog, GL3 stood out by its improved anticancer activity and well-defined Top 2 poisoning mechanisms, which merited the potential value of GL3 as an anticancer lead compound/drug candidate deserving further development.",

     "abstract": "The mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide (ATO) has been shown to be complex, influencing numerous signal transduction pathways and resulting in a vast range of cellular effects. Among these mechanisms of action, ATO has been shown to cause acute vascular shutdown and massive tumor necrosis in a murine solid tumor model like vascular disrupting agent (VDA). However, relatively little is understood about this VDA-like property and its potential utility in developing clinical regimens. We focused on this VDA-like action of ATO. On the basis of the endothelial cell cytotoxicity assay and tubulin polymerization assay, we observed that higher concentrations and longer treatment with ATO reduced the level of \u03b1- and \u03b2-tubulin and inhibited the polymerization of tubulin. The antitumor action and quantitative tumor perfusion studies were carried out with locally advanced murine CT26 colon carcinoma grown in female BALB/c mice. A single injection of ATO intraperitoneally displayed central necrosis of the tumor tissue by 24 hours. T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance image revealed a significant decrease in tumor enhancement in the ATO-treated group. Similar to other VDAs, ATO treatment alone did not delay the progression of tumor growth; however, ATO treatment after injection of other cytotoxic agent (irinotecan) showed significant additive antitumor effect compared to control and irinotecan alone therapy. In summary, our data demonstrated that ATO acts as a VDA by means of microtubule depolymerization. It exhibits significant vascular shutdown activity in CT26 allograft model and enhances antitumor activity when used in combination with another cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent.",

We treated the patient with two cycles of ipilimumab, followed by stereotactic ablative radiotherapy to two of seven hepatic metastases, and two additional cycles of ipilimumab. RESULTS: Subsequent positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan indicated that all metastases, including unirradiated liver lesions and an unirradiated axillary lesion, had completely resolved, consistent with a complete response by RECIST.

The present study investigated tissue response to docetaxel or zoledronic acid (ZA) in a mouse model of bony metastasis. Intratibial implantations of breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were monitored throughout this study using several modalities: molecular resonance imaging (MRI) tumor volume and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) bone volume, bioluminescence imaging (BLI) reporting cancer cell apoptosis, and fluorescence using Osteosense 800 and CatK 680-FAST. Docetaxel treatment resulted in tumor cell kill reflected by ADC and BLI increases and tumor volume reduction, with delayed bone recovery seen in \u00b5CT prefaced by increased osteoblastic activity (Osteosense 800). In contrast, the ZA treatment group produced similar values in MRI, BLI, and Osteosense 800 fluorescence imaging readouts when compared to controls. However, \u00b5CT bone volume increased significantly by the first week post-treatment and the CatK 680-FAST signal was slightly diminished by 4 weeks following ZA treatment.

Pathway bifurcation of AKT and mTOR was noted in both mouse and human prostate tumors. We demonstrated for the first time that cotargeting mTOR and AKT with ridaforolimus/MK-8669 and M1K-2206, respectively, delivers additive antitumor effects in vivo when compared to single agents.

Thirty-six cases (16.1%) exhibited the BRAFV600E mutation, including 66.7% of PXAs, 23.5% of GGs, 15.6% of PAs, and 9.7% of the malignant gliomas; the latter included 14.3% of AAs, 8.6% of GBs, and 4.5% of ODGs.

Patients' age, sex, histologic grade, and progression-free survival were also not correlated with the BRAFV600E mutation. The BRAFV600E mutation in brain tumors did not have prognostic value but is certainly a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target, not only for pediatric low-grade gliomas but also for malignant gliomas, even though the rate of mutation was not high.

The \u201cgold standard\u201d pO2 electrode measurements of hypoxia in vivo are unsatisfactory because they are invasive and have limited spatial coverage. Here, we present an approach to identify areas of tumor hypoxia using the signal versus time curves of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data as a surrogate marker of hypoxia. We apply an unsupervised pattern recognition (PR) technique to determine the differential signal versus time curves associated with different tumor microenvironmental characteristics in DCE-MRI data of a preclinical cancer model. Well-perfused tumor areas are identified by rapid contrast uptake followed by rapid washout; hypoxic areas, which are regions of reduced vascularization, are identified by delayed contrast signal buildup and washout; and necrotic areas exhibit slow or no contrast uptake and no discernible washout over the experimental observation. The strength of the PR concept is that it captures the pixel-enhancing behavior in its entirety\u2014during both contrast agent uptake and washout\u2014and thus, subtleties in the temporal behavior of contrast enhancement related to features of the tumor microenvironment (driven by vascular changes) may be detected. The assignment of the tumor compartments/microenvironment to well vascularized, hypoxic, and necrotic is validated by comparison to data previously obtained using complementary imaging modalities. The proposed novel analysis approach has the advantage that it can be readily translated to the clinic, as DCE-MRI is used routinely for the identification of tumors in patients, is widely available, and easily implemented on any clinical magnet.",

Five SNPs distributed in CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 gene cluster were selected for genotyping. The association between genotype and lung cancer risk was evaluated by computing the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) from multivariate unconditional logistic regression analyses with adjustment for gender and age.

Identification and characterization of genomic alterations associated with advanced disease can provide new markers of progression and better therapeutic approaches. METHODS: We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect the copy number gain of chromosome 16p13.3 in 75 PCa samples including 10 lymph node (LN) metastases and their matched primary tumors, 9 samples of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), and 46 additional primary PCa specimens with clinicopathologic parameters. RESULTS: We detected the gain in 5 of 10 LN metastases and 3 of 5 matched primary tumors, 3 of 9 CRPC samples, and 9 of 46 (20%) primary tumors where the 16p13.3 alteration was associated with high Gleason score and elevated preoperative prostate-specific antigen levels. The level of 16p13.3 gain was higher in LN metastasis and CRPC specimens compared to primary PCa. Chromosome mapping revealed the gain spans PDPK1 encoding the 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Knockdown of PDK1 in three PCa cell lines reduced migration without affecting growth and re-expressing PDK1 rescued motility.

Their promoter methylation profile was also evaluated. Drug-related genes were upregulated. Cisplatin resistance matched with high levels of BRCA1 and ERCC1 in both cell lines; docetaxel sensitivity of CAEP cells was associated to levels of TUBB3 lower than RAL cells. Although CAEP cells were more sensitive to gemcitabine, both cell lines showed high levels of RRM1. Stemness-related genes were downregulated in the control condition but became upregulated in docetaxel-resistant cells, indicating the selection of a population with stemness features.

These results highlight specific biomarkers consistent with the different responses of the two cell lines to standard pharmacological treatments and indicate specific molecular traits for their chemoresistance.",

     "abstract": "The use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by tumor reduction surgery, also called interval debulking surgery (IDS), is considered an alternative therapeutic regimen for selected patients with advanced stage epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Although minimal residual disease has been proven to be a prognostic factor in traditional cytoreduction for advanced stage EOC, predictive factors after IDS still remain unexplored. The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic value of post-neoadjuvant histologic changes with clinical outcome. Three pathologists evaluated 67 cases for the following parameters: fibrosis, necrosis, residual tumor, and inflammation. The Cohen's kappa statistic was used to measure agreement among pathologists. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the association between histologic parameters and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). There was substantial to almost perfect agreement among the three pathologists in all four histologic parameters (k ranged from 0.65 to 0.97). Fibrosis was associated with longer RFS (P = 0.0257) with a median of [20]months for tumors with fibrosis (3+) versus 12 months for tumors with fibrosis (1+, 2+) and longer OS (P = 0.0249) with a median of 51 months for tumors with fibrosis (3+) versus 32 months for tumors with fibrosis (1+, 2+). Our results revealed that patients with tumors exhibiting fibrosis (1+, 2+), as well as necrosis (0, 1+), had significant shorter RFS and OS (P = 0.059 and P = 0.0234, respectively). We suggest that the assessment of fibrosis and necrosis should be implemented in pathologic evaluation and prospectively validated in future studies.",

As an attempt to meet the crucial need for identification of the subpopulation of patients that will benefit from more individualized therapies, rapidly evolving therapies should allow a profiling of the tumors and/or of the CTCs. We established a triple fluorescence staining using eight cell lines to visualize the CTCs (cytokeratin detection) and then to define their individual ER\u03b1 and ErbB2 status. Afterward, we used this method for blood samples from 26 metastatic breast cancer patients. We identified major differences of ER\u03b1 levels between the cell lines and even within one cell line. For the metastatic patients, we detected and characterized CTCs in 38.5% of the patients with a total of 92 CTCs. We could demonstrate that at least 69.6% of the CTCs exhibit an ER\u03b1 and/or ErbB2 status different from the status of the primary tumor and that the CTCs from only 30% of the patients had no change of receptor status. Strikingly, heterogeneities of the status, aggregation, and size clearly appear within the CTCs. The data we generated outline the importance of a profiling not only of tumors but also of CTCs to establish individualized treatments. CTCs may then appear as new prognosis and treatment marker for both metastatic and adjuvant breast cancers.",

The MnSOD mimetic activity protects healthy cells against oxidative stress-induced detrimental effects, e.g., myelosuppressive effects of chemotherapy drugs. The contrast property depends on in vivo dissociation of Mn2+ from mangafodipir\u2014about 80% dissociates after injection. The SOD mimetic activity, however, depends on the intact Mn complex. Complexed Mn2+ is readily excreted in the urine, whereas dissociated Mn2+ is excreted slowly via the biliary route. Mn is an essential but also a potentially neurotoxic metal. For more frequent therapeutic use, neurotoxicity due to Mn accumulation in the brain may represent a serious problem. Replacement of 4/[5] of Mn2+ in mangafodipir with Ca2+ (resulting in calmangafodipir) stabilizes it from releasing Mn2+ after administration, which roughly doubles renal excretion of Mn. A considerable part of Mn2+ release from mangafodipir is governed by the presence of a limited amount of plasma zinc (Zn2+). Zn2+ has roughly 103 and 109 times higher affinity than Mn2+ and Ca2+, respectively, for fodipir. Replacement of 80% of Mn2+ with Ca2+ is enough for binding a considerable amount of the readily available plasma Zn2+, resulting in considerably less Mn2+ release and retention in the brain and other organs. At equivalent Mn2+ doses, calmangafodipir was significantly more efficacious than mangafodipir to protect BALB/c mice against myelosuppressive effects of the chemotherapy drug oxaliplatin. Calmangafodipir did not interfere negatively with the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin in CT2[6] tumor-bearing syngenic BALB/c mice, contrary calmangafodipir increased the antitumor activity.",

     "abstract": "Although radiotherapy represents one of the most effective treatment modalities for patients with cancer, inherent and/or acquired resistance of cancer cells to radiotherapy is often an impediment to effective treatment. Diverse strategies have been developed to improve the efficacy of radiotherapy. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) operates in numerous vital biologic processes by controlling the protein turnover in cells. Ubiquitination is central to the UPS pathway, and it relies on the E3 ubiquitin ligases to catalyze the covalent attachment of ubiquitin to its protein substrates. Cullin-based RING ligases (CRLs) are the largest family of E3 ligases that are responsible for the ubiquitination and destruction of numerous cancer-relevant proteins. Its deregulation has been linked to many human cancers, making it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. This review discusses how targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome system, particularly CRLs, is an exciting new strategy for radiosensitization in cancer and, specifically, focuses on MLN4924, a recently discovered small-molecule inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme, which is being characterized as a novel radiosensitizing agent against cancer cells by inactivating CRL E3 ubiquitin ligases.",

An endoscope was used to visualize adenomas in CPC;Apc mice weekly for 10 weeks. The lesion surface areas were measured using a distance gauge and digitally generated grid. Coronal scans were performed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to localize adenomas, and tumor volumes were measured from regions of interest drawn on consecutive axial scans. Rapamycin (5 mg/kg) was administered intraperitoneally daily for 5 weeks. Endoscopy and MRI were performed weekly to monitor adenoma regression. Caliper measurements and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were performed on adenomas postmortem. Dimensions from n = 30 adenomas in n = 7 animals were measured. Adenoma surface areas on endoscopy correlated with volumes on MRI and with postmortem caliper measurements, R2 = 0.84 and R2 = 0.81, respectively. The mean adenoma doubling times on endoscopy and MRI were 0.95 \u00b1 0.14 and 1.21 \u00b1 0.16 weeks, respectively. The minimum detectable adenoma surface area and volume on endoscopy and MRI was 0.69 mm2 and 1.76 mm3, respectively. On histology, the rapamycin-treated adenomas showed limited regions of dysplasia. Rapamycin therapy resulted in much lower mammalian target of rapamycin signaling and cell proliferation. Lower expression of phospho-S6 and reduced numbers of Ki67-positive cells were seen on IHC compared to vehicle-treated lesions. Endoscopy can be validated by MRI as a robust methodology for quantitative monitoring of therapy, representing a promising approach for future preclinical efforts to assess utility of novel colorectal cancer prevention strategies.",

In contrast to reports that suggest an inverse relationship between smoking and global DNA CpG methylation, hypermethylation of promoters of a number of genes was detected in saliva collected from patients with HNSCC. Using a sensitive methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) assay to determine specific methylation events in the promoters of RASSF1A, DAPK1, and p16 genes, we demonstrate that we can detect tumor presence with an overall accuracy of 81% in the DNA isolated from saliva of patients with HNSCC (n = 143) when compared with the DNA isolated from the saliva of healthy nonsmoker controls (n = 31). The specificity for this MSP panel was 87% and the sensitivity was 80% (with a Fisher exact test P < .0001). In addition, the test panel performed extremely well in the detection of the early stages of HNSCCs, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 87%, and a high \u03ba concordance value of 0.8, indicating an excellent overall agreement between the presence of HNSCC and a positive MSP panel result.

     "abstract": "Phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on tyrosine 845 by c-Src has been shown to be important for cell proliferation and migration in several model systems. This cross talk between EGFR and Src family kinases (SFKs) is one mechanism for resistance to EGFR inhibitors both in cell models and in the clinic. Here, we show that phosphorylation of tyrosine 845 on EGFR is required for proliferation and transformation using several cell models of breast cancer. Overexpression of EGFR-Y845F or treating cells with the SFK inhibitor dasatinib abrogated tyrosine 845 phosphorylation, yet had little to no effect on other EGFR phosphorylation sites or EGFR kinase activity. Abrogation of Y845 phosphorylation inhibited cell proliferation and transformation, even though extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt remained active under these conditions. Importantly, cotransfection of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase 3 and p38 MAPK restored cell proliferation in the absence of EGFR tyrosine 845 phosphorylation. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel role for p38 MAPK signaling downstream of EGFR tyrosine 845 phosphorylation in the regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation and transformation and implicate SFK inhibitors as a potential therapeutic mechanism for overcoming EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance in breast cancer.",

METHODS: PCXs from two pancreatic cancer cell lines were developed subcutaneously in nude mice and injected intraperitoneally with a low dose of cyclopamine for 1 week. 18F-FDG PET-CT was performed using a new-generation clinical PET-CT scanner with minor modifications of the scanning protocol to adapt for small-animal imaging. The data set was reconstructed and quantified using a three-dimensional workstation. RESULTS: MiaPaCa-2 cells, which respond to cyclopamine, showed decreased 18F-FDG uptake without a change in tumor size. For hip tumors, the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was reduced by -24.5 \u00b1 9.2%, the average SUV (SUVavg) by -33.5 \u00b1 7.0%, and the minimum SUV (SUVmin) by -54.4 \u00b1 11.5% (P < .05). For shoulder tumors, SUVmax was reduced by -14.7 \u00b1 7.5%, SUVavg by -12.6 \u00b1 6.3, and SUVmin by -30.3 \u00b1 16.7% (P < .05). Capan-1 cells, which do not respond to cyclopamine, did not show significant SUV changes.

     "abstract": "Pomegranate juice (PJ) is a natural product that inhibits prostate cancer progression. A clinical trial on patients with recurrent prostate cancer resulted in none of the patients progressing to a metastatic stage during the period of the trial. We have previously found that, in addition to causing cell death of hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells, PJ also markedly increases adhesion and decreases migration of the cells that do not die. However, because PJ is a very complex mixture of components and is found in many different formulations, it is important to identify specific components that are effective in inhibiting growth and metastasis. Here, we show that the PJ components luteolin, ellagic acid, and punicic acid together inhibit growth of hormone-dependent and hormone-refractory prostate cancer cells and inhibit their migration and their chemotaxis toward stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF1\u03b1), a chemokine that is important in prostate cancer metastasis to the bone. These components also increase the expression of cell adhesion genes and decrease expression of genes involved in cell cycle control and cell migration. Furthermore, they increase several well-known tumor-suppression microRNAs (miRNAs), decrease several oncogenic miRNAs, and inhibit the chemokines receptor type 4 (CXCR4)/SDF1\u03b1 chemotaxis axis. Our results suggest that these components may be more effective in inhibiting prostate cancer growth and metastasis than simply drinking the juice. Chemical modification of these components could further enhance their bioavailability and efficacy of treatment. Moreover, because the mechanisms of metastasis are similar for most cancers, these PJ components may also be effective in the treatment of metastasis of other cancers.",

To explore the impact of scheduling drug-IR administration, in the present study, we analyzed the response of lung carcinoma A549 and glioblastoma SNB19 cells to simultaneous drug-IR treatment followed by a long-term drug administration. Cellular response was evaluated at different time intervals after IR-alone, drug-alone, or combined drug-IR treatments by colony counts and expression profiles of Hsp90 and its clients, along with several apoptotic markers and cell cycle-related proteins, as well as by IR-drug-induced cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and repair. A short 30-minute exposure to either Hsp90 inhibitor did not affect the radiosensitivity of both tumor cell lines. Increasing the duration of post-IR-drug treatment progressively enhanced the sensitivity of SNB19 cells to IR. In contrast, the response of A549 cells to drug-IR combination was largely determined by the cytotoxic effects of both drugs without radiosensitization. Combined drug-IR treatment induced more severe DNA damage in both tumor cell lines than each treatment alone and also protracted the kinetics of DNA damage repair in SNB19 cells. In addition to large cell cycle disturbances, drug-IR treatment also caused depletion of the antiapoptotic proteins Akt and Raf-1 in both cell lines, along with a decrease of survivin in A549 cells in case of NVP-AUY922. The data show that simultaneous Hsp90 inhibition and irradiation may induce cell type-specific radiosensitization as well as cytotoxicity against tumor cells.",

Result: Positive expression of \u03b2-catenin and cyclin D1 was found in 72.5% (158 of 218 cases) and 59.4% (129 of 217 cases) of CRC patients, respectively.

     "abstract": "Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) and their ligands control critical biologic processes, such as cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Aberrant expression of these receptor kinases in tumor cells alters multiple downstream signaling cascades that ultimately drive the malignant phenotype by enhancing tumor cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. As observed in human glioblastoma (hGBM) and other cancers, this dysregulation of RTK networks correlates with poor patient survival. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Met, two well-known receptor kinases, are coexpressed in multiple cancers including hGBM, corroborating that their downstream signaling pathways enhance a malignant phenotype. The integration of c-Met and EGFR signaling in cancer cells indicates that treatment regimens designed to target both receptor pathways simultaneously could prove effective, though resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors continues to be a substantial obstacle. In the present study, we analyzed the antitumor efficacy of EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and gefitinib and c-Met inhibitor PHA-665752, along with their respective small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) alone or in combination with human umbilical cord blood stem cells (hUCBSCs), in glioma cell lines and in animal xenograft models. We also measured the effect of dual inhibition of EGFR/c-Met pathways on invasion and wound healing. Combination treatments of hUCBSC with tyrosine kinase inhibitors significantly inhibited invasion and wound healing in U251 and 5310 cell lines, thereby indicating the role of hUCBSC in inhibition of RTK-driven cell behavior. Further, the EGFR and c-Met localization in glioma cells and hGBM clinical specimens indicated that a possible cross talk exists between EGFR and c-Met signaling pathway.",

There was a significant decrease in the methylation ratio of the MGMT promoter determined by MS-MLPA, which was not detectable with MSP, and MGMT protein expression changes were not remarkable. However, there was no epigenetic variability in MMR genes, and a relatively homogeneous expression of MMR proteins was observed in initial and recurrent tumors.

Optical properties related to tissue microstructure and biochemical composition were obtained. Clinical and pathologic tumor response was evaluated using whole-mount pathology after mastectomy. Patients who responded to treatment demonstrated an initial increase followed by a drop in optical parameters measured in the whole breast, whereas nonresponding patients demonstrated only a drop in the same parameters 1 week after treatment initiation.

We sought to determine whether circulating neoplastic DNA results from alterations in the balance of angiogenesis activators and inhibitors. METHODS: Sixty patients with invasive ovarian carcinomas with somatic TP53 mutations that had been characterized for circulating neoplastic DNA had carcinoma analyzed for microvessel density using immunohistochemistry with CD31 and for the expression of VEGF, ANGPT1, ANGPT2, PTGS2, PLAU, THBS1, CSF1, PIK3CA, HIF1A, IL8, MMP2, and MMP9 message by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of each gene was calculated relative to GAPDH expression for each neoplasm. Patient plasma had been tested for circulating neoplastic DNA using a ligase detection reaction. RESULTS: MMP2 expression was significantly correlated with free plasma neoplastic DNA (P = .007). Microvessel density was not correlated with plasma neoplastic DNA or BRCA1/2 mutation status. The expression pattern of other angiogenic factors did not correlate with plasma neoplastic DNA but correlated with each other. BRCA1/2 mutated carcinomas had significantly different expression profiles of angiogenesis activators and inhibitors in comparison to sporadic carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: MMP2 expression is associated with the presence of circulating neoplastic DNA in women with ovarian carcinoma. These data are consistent with the proinvasive properties of MMP2 and suggest that the presence of circulating neoplastic DNA indicates a more aggressive malignant phenotype. Carcinomas with germ line BRCA1/2 mutations had a lower angiogenic profile than those without mutations.",

     "abstract": "Oxidative stress participates in doxorubicin (Dx)-induced cardiotoxicity. The metal complex MnDPDP and its metabolite MnPLED possess SOD-mimetic activity, DPDP and PLED have, in addition, high affinity for iron. Mice were injected intravenously with MnDPDP, DPDP, or dexrazoxane (ICRF-187). Thirty minutes later, mice were killed, the left atria were hung in organ baths and electrically stimulated, saline or Dx was added, and the contractility was measured for 60 minutes. In parallel experiments, 10 \u00b5M MnDPDP or MnPLED was added directly into the organ bath. The effect of MnDPDP on antitumor activity of Dx against two human tumor xenografts (MX-1 and A2780) was investigated. The in vitro cytotoxic activity was studied by co-incubating A2780 cells with MnDPDP, DPDP, and/or Dx. Dx caused a marked reduction in contractile force. In vivo treatment with MnDPDP and ICRF-187 attenuated the negative effect of Dx. When added directly into the bath, MnDPDP did not protect, whereas MnPLED attenuated the Dx effect by approximately 50%. MnDPDP or ICRF-187 did not interfere negatively with the anti-tumor activity of Dx, either in vivo or in vitro. Micromolar concentrations of DPDP but not MnDPDP displayed an in vitro cytotoxic activity against A2780 cells. The present results show that MnDPDP, after being metabolized to MnPLED, protects against acute Dx cardiotoxicity. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments show that cardioprotection takes place without interfering negatively with the anticancer activity of Dx. Furthermore, the results suggest that the previously described cytotoxic in vivo activity of MnDPDP is an inherent property of DPDP.",

Death receptor 6 (DR6) has been reported to be associated with suppression of antitumor immunity and tumor progression in several malignancies. However, expression of DR6 by malignant ovarian epithelial tumors at an early stage is unknown. The goals of this study were to determine whether DR6 is expressed by malignant ovarian epithelial tumors at an early stage and to examine whether DR6 expression is associated with ovarian cancer (OVCA) progression in a laying hen model of spontaneous OVCA. Expression of DR6 was examined in normal and malignant ovaries, normal ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells, or malignant epithelial cells and in serum of 3-year-old hens. The population of microvessels expressing DR6 was significantly higher in hens with early-stage OVCA than hens with normal ovaries (P < .01) and increased further in late-stage OVCA. The results of this study showed that, in addition to microvessels, tumor cells in the ovary also express DR6 with a significantly higher intensity than normal OSE cells. Similar patterns of DR6 expression were also observed by immunoblot analysis and gene expression studies. Furthermore, DR6 was also detected in the serum of hens. In conclusion, DR6 expression is associated with OVCA development and progression in laying hens. This study may be helpful to examine the feasibility of DR6 as a useful surrogate marker of OVCA, a target for antitumor immunotherapy and molecular imaging and thus provide a foundation for clinical studies.",

We asked if the severity of these telomere changes correlates with the clinical behavior of the disease. We retrospectively evaluated three-dimensional telomere organization by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) of diagnostic biopsies from 16 patients who were good responders and compared them with 16 diagnostic biopsies of 10 patients with refractory or relapsing HL (eight initial biopsies, four confirming progressions, and four confirming relapses). The H cells from patients with refractory/relapsing disease contained a significantly higher percentage of very small telomeres (P = .027) and telomere aggregates (P = .032) compared with H cells of patients entering rapid remission. These differences were even more significant (P = .002 and P = .013, respectively) when comparing the eight initial diagnostic biopsies of refractory/relapsing HL with diagnostic biopsies of eight patients with ongoing long-lasting remission (mean of 47 months).

The mechanisms that mediate TIS in cancer cells are not well defined. Herein, we characterize a robust senescence response both in vitro and in vivo to the quinone diaziquone (AZQ), previously identified in a high-throughput senescence-induction small-molecule screen. Using AZQ and several other agents that induce senescence, we screened a series of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and found that p27Kip1 was induced in all investigated prostate cancer cell lines. The ubiquitin-ligase Skp2 negatively regulates p27Kip1 and, during TIS, is translocated to the cytoplasm before its expression is decreased in senescent cells. Overexpression of Skp2 blocks the effects of AZQ on senescence and p27Kip1 induction. We also find that stable long-term short hairpin RNA knockdown of Skp2 decreases proliferation but does not generate the complete senescence phenotype. We conclude that Skp2 participates in regulating TIS but, alone, is insufficient to induce senescence in cancer cells.",

Our objective was to analyze DDC messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression in laryngeal tissues and to evaluate the clinical implication of this molecule in laryngeal cancer. In this study, total RNA was isolated from 157 tissue samples surgically removed from 100 laryngeal cancer patients. A highly sensitive real-time polymerase chain reaction methodology based on SYBR Green I fluorescent dye was developed for the quantification of DDC mRNA levels. In addition, Western blot analysis was performed for the detection of DDC protein. DDC mRNA expression was revealed to be significantly downregulated in primary laryngeal cancer samples compared with their nonmalignant counterparts (P = .001). A significant negative association was also disclosed between DDC mRNA levels and TNM staging (P = .034). Univariate analysis showed that patients bearing DDC-positive tumors had a significantly decreased risk of death (hazard ratio = 0.23, P = .012) and local recurrence (hazard ratio = 0.32, P =.006), whereas DDC expression retained its favorable prognostic significance in the multivariate analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves further demonstrated that DDC-positive patients experienced longer overall and disease-free survival periods (P = .006 and P = .004, respectively). Moreover, DDC protein was detected in both neoplastic and noncancerous tissues. Therefore, our results suggest that DDC expression status could qualify as a promising biomarker for the future clinical management of laryngeal cancer patients.",

Interferon response genes were found to be significantly coordinately regulated in two independent studies. We distilled a signature of 10 interferon response genes from two data sets. This signature exhibited strongly significant gene-versus-gene correlation of expression levels across samples in a third external medulloblastoma data set. Our medulloblastoma IFN signature identified a previously unrecognized patient subgroup partially overlapping the WNT and SHH subtypes proposed by others. We conclude that significant traces of differential activation of antiviral transcriptional response can be found in three independent medulloblastoma patient cohorts. This IFN activation signal often coincides with reduced proliferation scores. Our proposed 10-gene type I IFN response gene signature could help to assess antiviral states in further gene expression data sets of medulloblastomas or other cancers.",

We hypothesize not only that the presence of CD133 could be the source of tumor resistance but also that maintenance of this molecule by hypoxia dictates cellular and molecular behavior. From a series of human glioblastoma biopsies investigated, only one, IN699 (from a pediatric glioblastoma), generated greater than 4% of the total cell volume as CD133+ve cells. Using this pediatric glioblastoma, containing unprecedented high levels of the putative brain tumor stem cell marker CD133, as a study model, we report biologic and molecular characteristics of the parent culture and of CD133+ve and CD133-ve populations derived therefrom under atmospheric and hypoxic culture conditions. Immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry were performed with antigenic markers known to characterize neural stem cells and associated glioma behavior. Behavioral analysis was carried out using proliferation, adhesion, migration, and invasion assays. Cell cycle analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization were used to assess copy number profiles for parental cells and CD133+ve and CD133-ve fractions, respectively. With regard to invasion and proliferation, CD133+ve and CD133-ve fractions were inversely proportional, with a significant increase in invasive propensity within the CD133-ve cells (P < .005) and a significant increase in proliferation within CD133+ve cells (P < .005). Our observations indicate identical genomic imbalances between CD133+ve and CD133-ve fractions.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic role of Bax in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated with triplet chemotherapy COI regimen (capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan). METHODS: Pretreatment tissue blocks were available for 23 consecutive patients, selected for good performance status (ECOG \u2264 1) and consenting for treatment with first-line COI at a single institution. Bax levels were classified as positive or negative by immunohistochemistry (bax N20; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and related to outcome in terms of response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: Bax-negative and -positive samples were 26% and 74%, respectively. Bax expression was associated with significantly higher response rate (87% vs 33%), progression-free survival (8.7 vs 4.9 months, P = .016), and overall survival (23.8 vs 12.7 months, P = .025). In multivariate analysis including Bax and performance status, low Bax independently predicted worse outcome, along with suboptimal performance status. CONCLUSIONS: In advanced gastric cancer, Bax expression was related to clinical benefit with COI regimen. Whether Bax is a prognostic or mixed prognostic/predictive factor warrants prospective confirmation. It is to be defined if Bax predicts sensitivity to platinum analogs or to whatever chemotherapy regimen.",

Our goal is to develop an optical imaging approach using molecularly targeted contrast agents to assess several centimeters of mucosal surface for mapping expression of multiple biomarkers simultaneously with high spatial resolution. The ability to image biomarker expression level and heterogeneity in vivo would be extremely useful for clinical cancer research, patient selection of personalized medicine, and monitoring therapy. In this proof-of-concept ex vivo study, we examined correlation of neoplasia with two clinically relevant biomarkers: epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and metabolic activity. Two hundred eighty-six unique locations in nine samples of freshly resected oral mucosa were imaged after topically applying optical imaging agents EGF-Alexa 647 (to target EGFR) and 2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucose (to target metabolic activity). Quantitative features were calculated from resulting fluorescence images and compared with tissue histopathology maps. The EGF-Alexa 647 signal correlated well with EGFR expression as indicated by immunohistochemistry. A classification algorithm for presence of neoplasia based on the signal from both contrast agents resulted in an area under the curve of 0.83. Regions with a posterior probability from 0.80 to 1.00 contained more than 50% neoplasia 99% (84/85) of the time. This study demonstrates a proof-of-concept of how noninvasive optical imaging can be used as a tool to study expression levels of multiple biomarkers and their heterogeneity across a large mucosal surface and how biomarker characteristics correlate with presence of neoplasia. Applications of this approach include predicting regions with the highest likelihood of disease, elucidating the role of biomarker heterogeneity in cancer biology, and identifying patients who will respond to targeted therapy.",

Current guidelines in women's health outline the need for both the Papanicolaou test as well as high-risk HPV testing. Testing for HPV is expensive, is time-consuming, and requires experienced technicians. METHODS: Two sets of near-infrared Raman microspectroscopy experiments were conducted using a Raman confocal microscope system. First, Raman spectra were acquired from four different cell culture lines, two positive for HPV (HeLa, SiHa), one negative for HPV, but malignant (C33A), and one normal, HPV-negative line (NHEK). The three malignant lines were all derived from cervical cells. Second, Raman spectra were acquired from deidentified patient samples that were previously tested for the presence of high-risk HPV. RESULTS: The spectra from the cell culture lines and the patient samples contained many statistically significant differences. Using sparse multinomial logistic regression to classify the data led to classification accuracies of 89% to 97% for the cell culture samples and 98.5% for the patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: Raman micro-spectroscopy can be used to detect HPV and differentiate among specific HPV strains. This technique may provide health providers with a new method for quickly testing cell samples for the presence of HPV.",

Twenty-eight patients underwent FNA of breast lesions under ultrasonographic guidance. After smearing slides for cytology, residual cells were rinsed with TRIzol to recover RNA. RNA yield ranged from 0.78 to 88.40 \u00b5g per sample. FNA leftovers from 23 nonpalpable breast cancers were selected for gene expression profiling using oligonucleotide microarrays. Clusters generated by global expression profiles partitioned samples in well-distinguished subgroups that overlapped with clusters obtained using \u201cbiologic scores\u201d (cytohistologic variables) and differed from clusters based on \u201ctechnical scores\u201d (RNA/complementary RNA/microarray quality). Microarray profiling used to measure the grade of differentiation and estrogen receptor and ERBB2/HER2 status reflected the results obtained by histology and immunohistochemistry. Given that proliferative status in the FNA material is not always assessable, we designed and performed on FNA leftover a multiprobe genomic signature for proliferation genes that strongly correlated with the Ki67 index examined on histologic material. These findings show that cells residual to cytologic smears of FNA are suitable for obtaining high-quality RNA for high-throughput analysis even when taken from small nonpalpable breast lesions.",

In the Mia-PaCa-2 pancreatic tumor xenograft model in SCID mice, both the small-molecule Gd-DTPA-BMA and the macromolecule Galbumin MRI contrast agents produced dose-dependent decreases in tumor T1. By contrast, the decreases in tumor T1 provided by Gd-LC6-SH at 0.05 and 0.1 mmol/kg were not significantly different at longer times after injection. SCID mice bearing Mia-PaCa-2 or NCI-N87 tumor xenografts were treated with either the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine or the thiol-oxidizing anticancer drug Imexon, respectively. In both models, there was a significantly greater increase in tumor R1 (=1/T1) 60 minutes after injection of Gd-LC6-SH in drug-treated animals relative to saline-treated controls. In addition, Mercury Orange staining for nonprotein sulfhydryls was significantly decreased by drug treatment relative to controls in both tumor models. In summary, these studies show that thiol-bearing complexes of gadolinium such as Gd-LC6-SH can serve as redox-sensitive MRI contrast agents for detecting differences in tumor redox status and can be used to evaluate the effects of redox-active drugs.",

Expression levels of CD133, a putative GSC marker, and CD111 (nectin-1), an adhesion molecule that is the most efficient method for HSV entry, increased significantly under hypoxia in all three xenolines. Despite increased CD111 expression under hypoxic conditions, oHSV infectivity, cytotoxicity and viral recovery were not improved or were diminished in all three xenolines under hypoxia. In contrast, wild-type HSV-1 equally infected xenoline cells in normoxia and hypoxia, suggesting that the 34.5 mutation plays a role in the decreased C101 infectivity in hypoxia. Importantly, CD133+ cells were not more resistant to oHSV than CD133- tumor cells regardless of oxygen tension. Furthermore, CD133 expression decreased as viral dose increased in two of the xenolines suggesting that up-regulation of CD133 in hypoxia was not the cause of reduced viral efficacy. Our findings that oHSV infectivity and cytotoxicity were diminished under hypoxia in several GBM xenolines likely have important implications for clinical applications of oHSV therapies, especially considering the vital role of hypoxia in the microenvironment of GBM tumors.",

     "abstract": "Tumor cells grow in nutrient- and oxygen-deprived microenvironments and adapt to the suboptimal growth conditions by altering their metabolic pathways. This adaptation process commonly results in a tumor phenotype that displays a high rate of aerobic glycolysis and aggressive tumor characteristics. The glucose regulatory molecule, 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3), is a bifunctional enzyme that is central to glycolytic flux and is downstream of the metabolic stress sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which has been suggested to modulate glycolysis and possibly activate isoforms of PFKFB, specifically PFKFB3 expressed in tumor cells. Our results demonstrated that long-term low pH exposure induced AMPK activation, which resulted in the up-regulation of PFKFB3 and an increase in its serine residue phosphorylation. Pharmacologic activation of AMPK resulted in an increase in PFKFB3 as well as an increase in glucose consumption, whereas in contrast, inhibition of AMPK resulted in the down-regulation of PFKFB3 and decreased glycolysis. PFKFB3 overexpression in DB-1 tumor cells induced a high rate of glycolysis and inhibited oxygen consumption, confirming its role in controlling glycolytic flux. These results show that low pH is a physiological stress that can promote a glycolytic phenotype commonly associated with tumorigenesis. The implications are that the tumor microenviroment contributes to tumor growth and treatment resistance.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: The overall goal of this study was to assess the utility of three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for monitoring the temporal and spatial development of experimental brain metastasis in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Brain metastatic human breast cancer cells (231-BR or 231-BR-HER2) were injected intracardially in nude mice for delivery to the brain. Mouse brains were imaged in vivo at different time points using a balanced steady-state-free precession (bSSFP) pulse sequence at 1.5 T. Brains were categorized into four regions: cortex, central brain, olfactory, and posterior. The number of metastases and their volumes were quantified for both cell lines. RESULTS: There was no difference in the mean number of metastases for either cell line. The volumes of metastases in mice injected with 231-BR-HER2 cells were significantly larger than those for mice injected with 231-BR cells. The growth rate for 231-BR-HER2 metastases was 67.5% compared with 54.4% for the 231-BR metastases. More than 50% of metastases were located in the cortex and 25% to 30% of metastases were identified in the central brain for each time point and for mice injected with either cell line. The volumes of metastases were significantly larger in mice with fewer metastases at end point. SIGNIFICANT CONCLUSIONS: MRI provided a comprehensive accounting of the number and size of experimental brain metastases in the whole mouse brain at multiple time points. This approach has provided new information about the temporal and spatial development of metastases in the brain not possible by other histopathologic or imaging methods.",

     "abstract": "As a short-lived radical that diffuses across membranes, rather than interacting with membrane-bound receptors, nitric oxide (NO) represents a significant departure from synthetically derived radiosensitizers. An endogenous compound, NO may equal or surpass its molecular cousin, oxygen, as a hypoxic radiosensitizer, through pleiotropic phenotypic effects on tumor perfusion, cell signaling, mitochondrial respiration, the fixation of radiation-induced damage, and the radioprotection of normal tissue. However, unlike oxygen, in the context of radiosensitization, the clinical role and utility of NOare poorly understood, with often contradictory and controversial reported effects: whether NO functions as a radiosensitizer may ultimately be contextual to the tumor microenvironment. This may make NO manipulation an ideal candidate for a personalized radiosensitization approach tailored to specific patient and tumor types/microenvironmental characteristics. Effective delivery of NO both systemically and directly to the tumor may be critical to the success of this approach. Compounds that release NO or NO precursors have the potential to drive innovation and result in a new fertile branch of the radiosensitizer tree.",

In a previous study, we found a possible influence of the chromosome 5 status in the development of liver metastases in stage II colon cancers. We have here investigated the role of the APC gene, located in chromosome arm 5q, in a series of 183 colon adenocarcinomas through a combined analysis of gene expression, mutation, allelic loss and promoter methylation, and metastasis occurrence. Point mutations were found in 73% of cases and allelic losses were found in 39%; 59% of tumors presented with a biallelic inactivation, with a very strong interdependence of the two APC hits (P=2.1\u00d710-9). No associationwas found between expression, number and type of APC alterations, and metastatic evolution.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Luciferase-expressing MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic carcinoma cells were orthotopically injected in nude mice. BLI was compared to pathologic tumor volume, and photon emission was assessed over time. BLI was correlated to positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) to estimate tumor dimensions. BLI and cone-beam CT (CBCT) were used to compare tumor centroid location and estimate setup error. BLI and CBCT fusion was performed to guide irradiation of tumors using the small animal radiation research platform (SARRP). DNA damage was assessed by \u03b3-H2Ax staining. BLI was used to longitudinally monitor treatment response. RESULTS: Bioluminescence predicted tumor volume (R = 0.8984) and increased linearly as a function of time up to a 10-fold increase in tumor burden. BLI correlated with PET/CT and necropsy specimen in size (P < .05). Two-dimensional BLI centroid accuracy was 3.5 mm relative to CBCT. BLI-guided irradiated pancreatic tumors stained positively for \u03b3-H2Ax, whereas surrounding normal tissues were spared. Longitudinal assessment of irradiated tumors with BLI revealed significant tumor growth delay of 20 days relative to controls. CONCLUSIONS: We have successfully applied the SARRP to a bioluminescent, orthotopic preclinical pancreas cancer model to noninvasively: 1) allow the identification of tumor burden before therapy, 2) facilitate image-guided focal radiation therapy, and 3) allow normalization of tumor burden and longitudinal assessment of treatment response.",

     "abstract": "Attempts to enhance a patient's immune response and ameliorate the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer (OVCA) have largely been unsuccessful owing to the suppressive tumor microenvironment. Leukocyte immunoglobulin-like transcript 3 (ILT3) inhibitory receptors have been implicated in immunosuppression in several malignancies. The expression and role of ILT3 in the progression of ovarian tumors are unknown. This study examined the expression and association of ILT3 in ovarian tumors in laying hens, a spontaneous preclinical model of human OVCA. White Leghorn laying hens were selected by transvaginal ultrasound scanning. Serum and normal ovaries or ovarian tumors were collected. The presence of tumors and the expression of ILT3 were examined by routine histology, immunohistochemistry, Western blot analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition to stromal immune cell-like cells, the epithelium of the ovarian tumors also expressed ILT3 with significantly high intensity than normal ovaries. Among different subtypes of ovarian carcinomas, serous OVCA showed the highest ILT3 staining intensity, whereas endometrioid OVCA had the lowest intensity. Similar to humans, an immunoreactive protein band of approximately 55 kDa for ILT3 was detected in the ovarian tumors in hens. The patterns of ILT3 protein and messenger RNA expression by ovarian tumors in different subtypes and stages were similar to those of immunohistochemical staining. The results of this study suggest that laying hens may be useful to generate information on ILT3-associated immunosuppression in OVCA. This animal model also offers the opportunity to develop and test anti-ILT3 immunotherapy to enhance antitumor immunity against OVCA in humans.",

In addition, both factors are key components in cancer cell- related signaling. However, little information is available for uPA and PAI-1-associated signaling pathways in primary cancers and corresponding lymph node metastases. The aim of this study was to compare the expression of uPA and PAI-1-associated signaling proteins in 52 primary breast cancers and corresponding metastases. Proteins were extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples of the primary tumors and metastases. Protein lysates were subsequently analyzed by reverse phase protein array for the expression of members of the PI3K/AKT (FAK, GSK3-\u03b2, ILK, pGSK3-\u03b2, PI3K, and ROCK) and the MAPK pathways (pp38, pSTAT3, and p38). A solid correlation of uPA expression existed between primary tumors and metastases, whereas PAI-1 expression did not significantly correlate between them. The correlations of uPA and PAI-1 with signaling pathways found in primary tumors did not persist in metastases. Analysis of single molecules revealed that some correlated well between tumors and metastases (FAK, pGSK3-\u03b2, ILK, Met, PI3K, ROCK, uPA, p38, and pp38), whereas others did not (PAI-1 and GSK3-\u03b2).Whether the expression of a protein correlated between tumor and metastasis or not was independent of the pathway the protein is related to. These findings hint at a complete deregulation of uPA and PAI-1-related signaling in metastases, which might be the reason why uPA and PAI-1 reached clinical relevance only for lymph node- negative breast cancer tissues.",

We explored the prognostic impact of ether-a-g\u00f2-g\u00f2-related gene 1 channels and some hypoxia markers, in patients with nonmetastatic (stage I, II, and III) CRC. METHODS: The expression of hERG1, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), glucose transporter 1, carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), and p53 was tested by immunohistochemistry in 135 patients. The median follow-up was 35 months. Clinicopathologic parameters and overall survival were evaluated. RESULTS: hERG1 displayed a statistically significant association with Glut-1, VEGF-A, CA-IX, and EGF-R; p53 with VEGF-A and CA-IX; Glut-1 with the age of the patients; and EGF-R with TNM and mucin content. TNM and CA-IX were prognostic factors at the univariate analysis; TNM, hERG1, and Glut-1, at the multivariate analysis. Risk scores calculated from the final multivariate model allowed to stratify patients into four different risk groups: A) stage I-II, Glut-1 positivity, any hERG1; B) stage I-II, Glut-1 and hERG1 negativity; C) stage I-II, Glut-1 negativity, hERG1 positivity; D) stage III, any Glut-1 and any hERG1. CONCLUSIONS: hERG1 positivity with Glut-1 negativity identifies a patient group with poor prognosis within stage I-II CRC. The possibility that these patients might benefit from adjuvant therapy, independently from the TNM stage, is discussed. IMPACT: More robust prognostic and predictive markers, supplementing standard clinical and pathologic staging, are needed for node-negative patients.",

     "abstract": "Alterations in the gene expression profile in epithelial cells during breast ductal carcinoma (DC) progression have been shown to occur mainly between pure ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) to the in situ component of a lesion with coexisting invasive ductal carcinoma (DCIS-IDC) implying that the molecular program for invasion is already established in the preinvasive lesion. For assessing early molecular alterations in epithelial cells that trigger tumorigenesis and testing them as prognostic markers for breast ductal carcinoma progression, we analyzed, by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, eight genes previously identified as differentially expressed between epithelial tumor cells populations captured from preinvasive lesions with distinct malignant potential, pure DCIS and the in situ component of DCIS-IDC. ANAPC13 and CLTCL1 down-regulation revealed to be early events of DC progression that anticipated the invasiveness manifestation. Further down-regulation of ANAPC13 also occurred after invasion appearance and the presence of the protein in invasive tumor samples was associated with higher rates of overall and disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, tumors with low levels of ANAPC13 displayed increased copy number alterations, with significant gains at 1q (1q23.1-1q32.1), 8q, and 17q (17q24.2), regions that display common imbalances in breast tumors, suggesting that down-regulation of ANAPC13 contributes to genomic instability in this disease.",

In this study, serum samples from four patients with advanced Pca were collected at the time of the initial diagnosis and 3 months after AAT. Proteomic changes were analyzed with two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flightmass spectrometry. Altogether, nine proteinswere differentially expressed in the samples collected at diagnosis and in the samples collected after AAT. Among them, the expression of transthyretin (TTR) was 1.58-fold lower and clusterin (CLU) was 1.51-fold higher in the sera of post-AAT patients compared with those in the sera from pre-AAT patients. The significant changes in serum TTR and CLU in post-AAT patients were further confirmed by a large-scale ELISA. Immunohistochemistical staining revealed that the expression levels of TTR and CLU were significantly higher in Pca tissue than in normal and benign prostate hyperplasia tissue. The expression levels of TTR and CLU in Pca tissue were found to be associatedwith the grade and stage of Pca. Overall, this study indicated that TTR and CLU might be used to monitor the efficacy of AAT therapy and serve as biomarkers for the prognosis of Pca.",

In addition to their traditional roles, IGF-1R activation has been associated with increased radioresistance both in vitro and in vivo, although the molecular mechanisms behind this process are still unclear. Recently, IGF-1R has been associated to new partners as major vault proteins, BCL-2, BAX, or Ku70/80, related to radiochemotherapy resistance, regulation of apoptosis, and nonhomologous end-joining DNA repair. Here, we review these novel associations of IGF-1R trying to explain the resistance to radiotherapy mediated by IGF-1R.

MR data were evaluated from 51 patients with newly diagnosed grade 3 gliomas. Anatomic, diffusion, and metabolic imaging data were considered. Variations in metabolite levels, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and fractional anisotropy (FA) were evaluated in regions of gadolinium enhancement and T2 hyperintensity as well as regions with abnormal metabolic signatures. Contrast enhancement was present in only 21 of the 51 patients. When present, the enhancing component of the lesion had higher choline-to-N-acetylaspartate index (CNI), higher choline, lower N-acetylaspartate, similar creatine, similar ADC and FA, and higher lactate/lipid than the nonenhancing lesion. Regions with CNI \u2265 4 had higher choline, lower N-acetylaspartate, higher lactate/lipid, higher ADC, and lower FA than normal-appearing white matter and regions with intermediate CNI values. For lesions that exhibited gadolinium enhancement, the metabolite levels and diffusion parameters in the region of enhancement were consistent with it corresponding to the most abnormal portion of the tumor. For nonenhancing lesions, areas with CNI \u2265 4 were the most abnormal in metabolic and diffusion parameters. This suggests that the region with the highest CNI might provide a good target for biopsies for nonenhancing lesions to obtain a representative histologic diagnosis of its degree of malignancy. Metabolic and diffusion parameter levels may be of interest not only for directing tissue sampling but also for defining the targets for focal therapy and assessing response to therapy.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to characterize the reproducibility of measurement for tumor volumes and their longest tumor diameters (LDs) and estimate the potential impact of using changes in tumor volumes instead of LDs as the basis for response assessments. METHODS: We studied patients with advanced lung cancer who have been observed longitudinally with x-ray computed tomography in a multinational trial. A total of 71 time points from 10 patients with 13 morphologically complex target lesions were analyzed. A total of 6461 volume measurements and their corresponding LDs were made by seven independent teams using their own work flows and image analysis tools. Interteam agreement and overall interrater concurrence were characterized. RESULTS: Interteam agreement between volume measurements was better than between LD measurements (\u0131 = 0.945 vs 0.734, P = .005). The variability in determining the nadir was lower for volumes than for LDs (P = .005). Use of standard thresholds for the RECIST-based method and use of experimentally determined cutoffs for categorizing responses showed that volume measurements had a significantly greater sensitivity for detecting partial responses and disease progression. Earlier detection of progression would have led to earlier changes in patient management in most cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that measurement of changes in tumor volumes is adequately reproducible. Using tumor volumes as the basis for response assessments could have a positive impact on both patient management and clinical trials. More authoritative work to qualify or discard changes in volume as the basis for response assessments should proceed.",

Toxicities were seen in normal cells in tissue culture. In vivo normal tissue injury occurred at doses twice the effective dose. The current study was conducted to define, in greater detail, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacodynamics, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of twice-weekly intraperitoneal HuArg I [Co]-PEG5000 in Balb/c mice. Animal weight and survival were monitored, serum arginine levels measured, and complete blood cell counts, chemistries, necropsies, and histologies were performed. In addition, methods to ameliorate the HuArg I [Co]-PEG5000 adverse effects were tested. Supplemental l-citrulline was given concurrently with the arginase drug. The HuArg I [Co]-PEG5000 MTD in mice was 5 mg/kg twice weekly, and DLTs included weight loss and marrow necrosis. No other organ damage or changes in blood cell counts or chemistries were observed. Arginase reduced serum arginine levels from 60 \u00b5M to 4 to 6 \u00b5M. Supplemental l-citrulline given per os or daily subcutaneously reduced and delayed toxicities, and l-citrulline given twice daily subcutaneously completely prevented animal toxicities. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that HuArg I [Co]-PEG5000, particularly with supplemental l-citrulline, may be an attractive therapeutic agent for argininosuccinate synthetase-deficient tumors.",

The present translational study tested if pretreatment with mangafodipir lowers AEs during curative (adjuvant) FOLFOX6 chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer (Dukes' C). The study was originally scheduled to include 20 patients, but because of the unforeseen withdrawal of mangafodipir from the market, the study had to be closed after 14 patients had been included. The withdrawal of mangafodipir was purely based on commercial considerations from the producer and not on any safety concerns. The patients were treated throughout the first 3 of 12 scheduled cycles. Patients were randomized to a 5-minute infusion of either mangafodipir or placebo (7 in each group). AEs were evaluated according to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events and the Sanofi-NCI criteria. The primary end points were neutropenia and neurosensory toxicity. There were four AEs of grade 3 (severe) and one AE of grade 4 (life threatening) in four patients in the placebo group, whereas there were none in the mangafodipir group (P < .05). Of the grade 3 and 4 events, two were neutropenia and one was neurosensory toxicity. Furthermore, white blood cell count was statistically, significantly higher in the mangafodipir group than in the placebo group (P < .01) after treatment with FOLFOX. This small feasibility study seems to confirm what has been demonstrated preclinically, namely, that pretreatment with mangafodipir lowers AEs during adjuvant 5-fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in colon cancer patients.",

Thus, we investigated whether blockage of the ETR pathways using the dual ETR antagonist macitentan combined with taxol or cisplatinum can produce therapy for orthotopically growing multidrug-resistant (MDR) human ovarian carcinoma. In several studies, nude mice were injected in the peritoneal cavity with HeyA8-MDR human ovarian cancer cells. Ten days later, mice were randomized to receive vehicle (saline), macitentan (oral, daily), taxol (intraperitoneal, weekly), cisplatinum (intraperitoneal, weekly), macitentan plus taxol, or macitentan plus cisplatinum. Moribund mice were killed, and tumors were collected, weighed, and prepared for immunohistochemical analysis. The HeyA8-MDR tumors did not respond to taxol, cisplatinum, or macitentan administered as single agents. In contrast, combination therapy with macitentan and taxol or macitentan and cisplatinum significantly decreased the tumor incidence and weight and significantly increased the survival of mice and their general condition. Multiple immunohistochemical analyses revealed that treatment with macitentan and macitentan plus taxol or cisplatinum inhibited the phosphorylation of ETRs, decreased the levels of pVEGFR2, pAkt, and pMAPK in tumor cells after 2 weeks of treatment and induced a first wave of apoptosis in tumor-associated endothelial cells followed by apoptosis in surrounding tumor cells. Our study shows that ovarian cancer cells, which express the endothelin axis and are multidrug resistant, are exquisitely sensitive to treatment with a dual ET antagonist and can be resensitized to both taxol and cisplatinum. This combined therapy led to a significant reduction in tumor weight.",

However, this information can contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the association of MHC class I antigen and APM component defects with malignant transformation of cells and to identify animal models to validate targeted therapies to correct these defects. To overcome this limitation in the present study, we have investigated the expression of the catalytic subunits of proteasome (Y, X, and Z) and of immunoproteasome (LMP2, LMP7, and LMP10) as well as of MHC class I heavy chain (HC) in 25 primary feline mammary carcinomas (FMCs) and in 23 matched healthy mammary tissues. We found a reduced expression of MHC class I HC and of LMP2 and LMP7 in tumors compared with normal tissues. Concordantly, proteasomal cleavage specificities in extracts from FMCs were different from those in healthy tissues. In addition, correlation analysis showed that LMP2 and LMP7 were concordantly expressed in FMCs, and their expression was significantly correlated with that of MHC class I HC. The abnormalities we have found in the APM in FMCs may cause a defective processing of some tumor antigens.",

Correlation between ALT and patient survival was demonstrated for high-grade astrocytomas. Transcription from subtelomeres produces telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), a natural inhibitor of telomerase activity (TA). This led us to evaluate correlations of TERRA and TMM with tumor grade and outcome in astrocytoma patients. SYBR Green real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays for quantitation of total and chromosome 2p and 18p specific TERRA levels were developed. Tumor samples from 46 patients with astrocytoma grade 2 to 4, tissue controls, and cell lines were assessed. TMMs were evaluated by measuring TA and by detecting long telomeres due to ALT. In glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) grade 4, total TERRA levels were similar to cell lines but 14-, 31-, and 313-fold lower compared with grade 3, grade 2, and nonmalignant tissue, respectively. Total TERRA levels differed from chromosomal levels. Low 2p TERRA levels correlated with dense promoter methylation of subtelomeric CpG islands, indicating that TERRA expression in gliomas may be chromosome specific and epigenetically regulated. Total TERRA levels correlated with diagnosis, with low or absent TA and the presence of ALT, and were tentatively associated with favorable patient prognosis in our cohort (P = .06).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We identified 523 cases of invasive breast carcinoma from our database. The clinicopathologic findings and the biologic markers including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) status were reviewed. IHC stains for cytokeratin 5/6 (CK5/6), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), p53, and Glut-1 were performed on tissue microarray using standard procedures. BLBC was defined as ER-,PR-, Her2-, and CK5/6+ and/or EGFR+. RESULTS: Of informative cases, 14.7% were categorized as BLBC versus 85.3% as non-BLBC. Glut-1 was expressed in 42 (76.4%) of 55 BLBCs, whereas only 55 (23.8%) of 231 non-BLBCs showed immunostaining for Glut-1 (P < .001). Overall, Glut-1 expression was significantly associated with high histologic grade, ER negativity, PR negativity, CK5/6 positivity, EGFR expression, and high p53 expression (P < .001). However, there was no correlation between Glut-1 immunostaining and patient's outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Glut-1 is significantly associated with BLBC and might be a potential therapeutic target for this aggressive subgroup of breast cancer, and this warrants further investigations.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: P21-activated kinase 4 (PAK), a subfamily of serine/threonine kinases originally known as a regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and cell motility, has recently been revealed to play a key role in oncogenic signaling pathways. We studied the frequency and clinical features of PAK4-overexpressed metastatic gastric cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: PAK4 overexpression was screened by Western blot in 18 human gastric cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical staining of PAK4 protein was performed in tumor specimens of 49 metastatic gastric cancer patients who received palliative capecitabine/cisplatin as first-line treatment. RESULTS: PAK4 protein overexpression was detected strongly in five gastric cell lines (AGS, MGK-28, MKN-74, SNU-216, SNU-601) and weakly in four cell lines (KATOIII, MKN-1, SNU-620, and SNU-719). PAK4 knockdown by small interfering RNA induced apoptosis in PAK4-overexpressed AGS gastric cancer cells. Immunohistochemical staining revealed PAK4 overexpressions in 4 (8.1%) of 49 metastatic gastric cancer specimens. None of the four patients with PAK4(+) responded to capecitabine/cisplatin chemotherapy, and PAK4(+) gastric cancer patients had a trend of poorer survival compared with PAK(-)(P = .876). CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated PAK4 overexpression in a subset of gastric cancer patients, implicating a role in gastric cancer tumorigenesis. Its prognostic significance and efficacy as a drug target should be further studied.",

Two separate conjugations of Gd@C60(OH)x with the antibody ZME-018 and a murine antibody mixture (MuIgG) were performed in a 1:5 mAb/Gd@C60 ratio. Characterization of the immunoconjugates was established using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for Gd3+ and UV-Vis spectrometry (for Gd@C60 + C60). Once conjugated, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed little change in the specific binding of ZME-018. Each immunoconjugate was exposed to two cancer cell lines, A375m (antigen positive), and T24, bladder carcinoma (antigen negative). Internalization levels of the immunoconjugate were determined at various time points during 24 hours by harvesting and digesting the cells with 70% HNO3 for Gd3+ ion analysis by ICP-MS.

It also becomes exposed on tumors cells responding to therapy. In the present study, we optically imaged exposed PS in vivo using PGN635, a novel monoclonal antibody that binds PS. The F(ab\u2032)2 fragment of PGN635 was labeled with the near-infrared (NIR) dye, IRDye800CW. In vivo dynamic NIR imaging was performed after injection of 800CW-PGN635 into mice bearing radiation-treated or untreated U87 glioma xenografts growing subcutaneously or orthotopically. NIR optical imaging revealed a clear tumor contrast in nonirradiated subcutaneous U87 gliomas after injection of 800CW-PGN635. The tumor contrast was visible as early as 4 hours later and was maximal 24 hours later (tumor-to-normal tissue ratio [TNR] = 2.8 \u00b1 0.7). Irradiation enhanced the tumor contrast at 24 hours (TNR = 4.0 \u00b1 0.3). Similar results were observed for orthotopic gliomas. Localization of 800CW-PGN635 to tumors was antigen specific because 800CW-Aurexis, a control probe of irrelevant specificity, did not localize to the tumors, and preadministration of unlabeled PGN635 blocked the uptake of 800CW-PGN635. Fluorescence microscopy confirmed that 800CW-PGN635 was binding to PS-positive vascular endothelial cells in nonirradiated gliomas. Irradiation of the gliomas increased PS exposure on both tumor vascular endothelial cells and tumor cells and gave rise to an increase in tumor contrast with 800CW-PGN635 that was predictive of the reduction in tumor growth. 800CW-PGN635 may be a useful new imaging probe for detection of exposed PS in tumors responding to therapy.",

     "abstract": "Classic cancer research for several decades has focused on understanding the biology of tumor cells in vitro. However, extending these findings to in vivo settings has been impeded owing to limited insights on the impact of microenvironment on tumor cells. We hypothesized that tumor cell biology and treatment response would be more informative when done in the presence of stromal components, like endothelial cells, which exist in the tumor microenvironment. To that end, we have developed a system to grow three-dimensional cultures of GFP-4T1 mouse mammary tumor and 2H11 murine endothelial cells in hanging drops of medium in vitro. The presence of 2H11 endothelial cells in these three-dimensional cocultures was found to sensitize 4T1-GFP tumor cells to chemotherapy (Taxol) and, at the same time, protect cells from ionizing radiation. These spheroidal cultures can also be implanted into the dorsal skinfold window chamber of mice for fluorescence imaging of vascularization and disease progression/treatment response. We observed rapid neovascularization of the tumor-endothelial spheroids in comparison to tumor spheroids grown in nude mice. Molecular analysis revealed pronounced up-regulation of several proangiogenic factors in the tumor tissue derived from the tumor-endothelial spheroids compared with tumor-only spheroids. Furthermore, the rate of tumor growth from tumor-endothelial spheroids in mice was faster than the tumor cell-only spheroids, resulting in greater metastasis to the lung. This three-dimensional coculture model presents an improved way to investigate more pertinent aspects of the therapeutic potential for radiation and/or chemotherapy alone and in combination with antiangiogenic agents.",

At 20 years of follow-up, serum-inducible TrpRS phosphorylation found years before healthy donors (3/15) diagnosed with PC, CRC, or leukemia. I have examined a specificity of serum-inducible TrpRS phosphorylation and found, surprisingly, that serine phosphorylation of unfolded TrpRS is stimulated by anti-TrpRS rabbit antisera but is unaffected by rabbit nonimmune sera and antisera to other antigens. Anti-TrpRS immunoglobulin G (IgG) inhibits phosphorylation of full-length TrpRS and stimulates phosphorylation of its 20-kDa fragment. Phosphorylation of this fragment is stimulated also by CS but not NS. 2-Mercaptoethanol and cyclic AMP exerted synergistic inhibitory effect on TrpRS phosphorylation. Anti-TrpRS sera and casein act as chaperones increasing TrpRS phosphorylation through refolding. Histone-specific protein kinase activity in CS (n = 44) and anti-TrpRS sera was lower than that in NS (n = 11), rabbit nonimmune sera and antisera to other antigens. TrpRS inhibitors, tryptamine, and tryptophanol stimulate in vivo accumulation of enzymatically inactive, nonphosphorylated, aggregated and anti-TrpRS IgG refoldable TrpRS. Phosphorylation of postsurgical tissues (n = 18) reveals TrpRS in ovarian cancer (OVC) and CC but not in normal placenta and liver. In OVC, TrpRS phosphorylation increase correlates with elevated tryptophan-dependent ATP-inorganic pyrophosphate exchange.

Furthermore, we found that escapee cells formed significantly less neurospheres in vitro, suggesting that IL-13R\u03b12-targeted therapy preferentially targeted the \u201cstem-like\u201d cell population and possibly indicating decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. We therefore tested escapee cells for in vivo tumorigenicity and found that they were significantly less tumorigenic in both subcutaneous and intracranial mouse models compared to matching parental cells.

Proposed here is an expansion on the idea of ecological therapy of cancer, incorporating 1) literature on species invasion, i.e., a right cancerous clone needs to be at the right place at the right time to actually invade its environment, and 2) the literature on niche construction, that is, the idea that once a tumor is formed, cancer cells they modify their microenvironment (niche construction) by changing pH through glycolysis, secreting growth factors and recruiting tumor-associated macrophages to promote cell growth, activating fibroblasts, evading predation from immune system, making the cancer that much more difficult to eradicate. Paleontological literature suggests that the largestmass extinctions occurred when environmental stress that would weaken the population was coupled with some pulse destructive event that caused extensive mortality. To have the same effect on cells in the tumor, rather than, or at least in addition to, killing the cells, one would also need to target the niche that they created for themselves.",

     "abstract": "Numerous epidemiological studies have consistently demonstrated that individuals who eat more fruits and vegetables (which are rich in carotenoids) and who have higher serum \u03b2-carotene levels have a lower risk of cancer, especially lung cancer. However, two human intervention trials conducted in Finland and in the United States have reported contrasting results with high doses of \u03b2-carotene supplementation increasing the risk of lung cancer among smokers. The failure of these trials to demonstrate actual efficacy has resulted in the initiation of animal studies to reproduce the findings of these two studies and to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for the harmful or protective effects of carotenoids in lung carcinogenesis. Although these studies have been limited by a lack of animal models that appropriately represent human lung cancer induced by cigarette smoke, ferrets and A/J mice are currently the most widely used models for these types of studies. There are several proposed mechanisms for the protective effects of carotenoids on cigarette smoke-induced lung carcinogenesis, and these include antioxidant/prooxidant effects, modulation of retinoic acid signaling pathway and metabolism, induction of cytochrome P450, and molecular signaling involved in cell proliferation and/or apoptosis. The technical challenges associated with animal models include strain-specific and diet-specific effects, differences in the absorption and distribution of carotenoids, and differences in the interactions of carotenoids with other antioxidants. Despite the problems associated with extrapolating from animal models to humans, the understanding and development of various animal models may provide useful information regarding the protective effects of carotenoids against lung carcinogenesis.",

We also report that radiation causes \u03b15\u03b21 up-regulation in Panc-1, MiaPaCa-2, and BxPC-3 tumor xenografts and that upregulated \u03b15\u03b21 colocalizes with upregulated early or late endosomes in Panc-1 or BxPC-3 tumors, respectively, although it may colocalize significantly with both endosome types in MiaPaCa-2 tumors.

     "abstract": "The estrogen receptor (ER) pathway and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway play pivotal roles in breast cancer progression. Targeted therapies able to intercept ER or signaling downstream to EGFR and its kin, HER2, are routinely used to treat distinct groups of breast cancer patients. However, patient responses are limited by resistance to endocrine therapy, which may be due to compensatory HER2/EGFR signaling. This raises the possibility that simultaneous interception of HER2 and ER may enhance therapeutic efficacy. To address the question, we treated breast cancer cells with both fulvestrant (ICI 182780), an ER antagonist with no agonist effects, and lapatinib, an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor specific to EGFR and HER2. Our results indicate that the combination of drugs is especially effective when applied to HER2-overexpressing, ER-positive cancer cells. Interestingly, fulvestrant activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway of these cells, but complete inhibition of MAPK signaling was observed on cotreatment with lapatinib. Taken together, our observations reinforce the possibility that the effectiveness of combining anti-ER and anti-HER2/EGFR drugs may be especially effective on a relatively small subtype of HER2-overexpressing, ER-positive tumors of the breast.",

All experiments were performed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays, covering 22,277 probe sets. Genes were filtered and analyzed using analysis of variance, t test, fold-change calculations, and unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis. Further processing included functional analysis and overrepresentation calculations based on Gene Ontology, Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The molecular phenotypes of VSCC patients exhibited significant and discrete transcriptional differences from the healthy controls, whereas principal component analysis documented that this separation is mediated by a consistent set of gene expression differences. We detected 1077 genes (306 upregulated and 771 downregulated) that were differentially expressed between VSCC patients and healthy controls by at least twofold (P < .01), whereas a novel subset of patients was revealed displaying a distinct pattern of 125 upregulated genes involved in multiple cellular processes. Functional analysis of the 1077 genes documented their involvement in more than 50 signaling pathways, such as PTEN, oncostatin M, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling, affecting extracellular matrix remodeling and invasion.

Here we use immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of Slit2 in normal donor prostate (NDP), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (HGPIN), normal tissue adjacent to prostatic adenocarcinoma (NAC), primary prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa), and metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma (Mets). METHODS: Tissue microarrays were immunostained for Slit2. The staining intensities were quantified using automated image analysis software. The data was statistically analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with subsequent Tukey tests for multiple comparisons or a nonparametric equivalent. Eleven cases of NDP, 35 cases of NAC, 15 cases of BPH, 35 cases of HGPIN, 106 cases of PCa, and 37 cases of Mets were analyzed. RESULTS: Specimens of PCa and HGPIN had the highest absolute staining for Slit2. Significant differences were seen between PCa and NDP (P < .05), PCa and NAC (P < .05), HGPIN and NDP (P < .05), and HGPIN and NAC (P < .05). Whereas the average Mets staining was not significantly different from NDP or NAC, several individual Mets cases featured intense staining. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this represents the first study comparing the immunohistochemical profiles of Slit2 in PCa and Mets to specimens of HGPIN, BPH, NDP, and NAC. These findings suggest that Slit2 expression can be increased in HGPIN, PCa, and Mets, making it a potentially important biomarker for prostate cancer.",

We previously reported an association between high expression of RBM3 and prolonged survival in breast and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Because the function of RBM3 has not been fully elucidated, the aim of this study was to use gene set enrichment analysis to identify the underlying biologic processes associated with RBM3 expression in a previously analyzed EOC cohort (cohort 1, n = 267). This revealed an association between RBM3 expression and several cellular processes involved in the maintenance of DNA integrity. RBM3-regulated genes were subsequently screened in the HPA to select for putative prognostic markers, and candidate proteins were analyzed in the ovarian cancer cell line A2780, whereby an up-regulation of Chk1, Chk2, and MCM3 was demonstrated in siRBM3-treated cells compared to controls. The prognostic value of these markers was assessed at the messenger RNA level in cohort 1 and the protein level in an independent EOC cohort (cohort 2, n = 154). High expression levels of Chk1, Chk2, and MCM3 were associated with a significantly shorter survival in both cohorts, and phosphorylated Chk2 was an adverse prognostic marker in cohort 2. These results uncover a putative role for RBM3 in DNA damage response, which might, in part, explain its cisplatin-sensitizing properties and good prognostic value in EOC. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that Chk1, Chk2, and MCM3 are poor prognostic markers in EOC.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a transient process occurring during developmental stages and carcinogenesis, characterized by phenotypic and molecular alterations, resulting in increased invasive and metastatic capabilities of cancer cells and drug resistance. Moreover, emerging evidence suggests that EMT is associated with increased enrichment of cancer stem-like cells in neoplastic tissues. We interrogated the molecular alterations occurring in breast cancer using proposed EMT markers such as E-cadherin, vimentin, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) D, and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) to decipher their roles in the EMT and breast cancer progression. METHODS: Fifty-seven invasive ductal adenocarcinomas of the breast were assessed for the expression of E-cadherin, vimentin, EGFR, NF-\u03baB, and PDGF-D using immunohistochemical analysis. Tumors were categorized into three groups: A (ER+, and/or PR+, HER-2/neu-), B (ER+, and/or PR+, HER-2/neu+), and C (triple-negative: ER-, PR-, and HER-2/neu-). Immunostained slides were microscopically evaluated and scored using intensity (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+) and percentage of positive cells, and data were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Membranous E-cadherin was positive in all 57 cases (100%), whereas cytoplasmic E-cadherin was predominantly positive in groups B and C compared with group A (21%, 7%, and 0%, respectively). All group A cases were negative for vimentin and EGFR. There was statistically significant increased expression of vimentin (P < .0002), EGFR (P < .0001), and NF-\u03baB (P < .02) in triple-negative cases when compared with groups A and B. CONCLUSIONS: Vimentin, EGFR, and NF-\u03baB were significantly increased in triple-negative tumors, which is consistent with the aggressiveness of these tumors. These markers could be useful as markers for EMT in breast cancers and may serve as predictive markers for designing customized therapy in the future.",

The reduction in CSCs according to phenotypic markers was accompanied by a decrease in functional CSC activity measured by tumor sphere frequency and the ability to form tumors in mice. In contrast, another patient tumor sample displayed enrichment of CSC after irradiation, signifying radioresistance, in agreement with others. CSC response to radiation did not correlate with the level of reactive oxygen species in CSC versus non-CSC.

In this study, Ac-TZ14011-FITC was validated for CXCR4 staining in human breast cancer cell lines MDAMB231 and MDAMB231CXCR4+ during flow cytometric analysis. Its efficacy was compared to commercially available antibodies. Competition experiments validated the staining specificity. Confocal imaging revealed that CXCR4 staining was predominantly found on the cell membrane and/or in vesicles formed after endocytosis. Next to being able to differentiate \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d CXCR4-expressing tumor cells, the fluorescent peptide demonstrates potential in fluorescent immunohistochemistry of tumor tissue. Ac-TZ14011-FITC was able to differentiate MDAMB231 from MDAMB231CXCR4+ tumor cells and tissue, proving its applicability in the detection of differences in CXCR4 expression levels.",

     "abstract": "The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway is one of the most altered in cancer, leading to a range of cellular responses including enhanced proliferation, survival, and metabolism, and is thus an attractive target for anticancer drug development. Stimulation of the PI3K pathway can be initiated by alterations at different levels of the signaling cascade including growth factor receptor activation, as well as mutations in PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT genes frequently found in a broad range of cancers. Given its role in glucose metabolism, we investigated the utility of [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([18F]FDG PET) as a pharmacodynamic biomarker of PI3K pathway-induced glucose metabolism. PTEN deletion in human colon carcinoma cells led to constitutive AKT activation but did not confer a phenotype of increased cell proliferation or glucose metabolism advantage in vivo relative to isogenic tumors derived from cells with a wild-type allele. This was not due to the activation context, that is, phosphatase activity, per se because PIK3CA activation in xenografts derived from the same lineage failed to increase glucose metabolism. Acute inhibition of PI3K activity by LY294002, and hence decreased activated AKT expression, led to a significant reduction in tumor [18F]FDG uptake that could be explained at least in part by decreased membrane glucose transporter 1 expression. The pharmacodynamic effect was again independent of PTEN status. In conclusion, [18F]FDG PET is a promising pharmacodynamic biomarker of PI3K pathway inhibition; however, its utility to detect glucose metabolism is not directly linked to the magnitude of activated AKT protein expression.",

Antitumor activity of CVX-045 was evaluated in human xenograft models alone and in combination with standard chemotherapies and targeted molecules. In A549 and A431 xenograft models, CVX-045 demonstrated significant (P < .05) antiangiogenic activity, reducing tumor microvessel density and increasing the levels of necrosis within treated tumors. In an HT-29 xenograft model, CVX-045 in combination with 5-fluorouracil significantly (P < .01) decreased tumor growth rate compared with vehicle, CVX-045, or 5-fluorouracil alone. Cotreatment of CVX-045 plus CPT-11 delayed progression of tumor growth from day 28 to 60. In contrast CVX-045 alone treatment did not delay the progression of tumor growth, and CPT-11 alone delayed progression of tumor growth to day 39. Cotreatment of CVX-045 with sunitinib extended the time to reach tumor load from day 26 to 40. In summary, CVX-045 exhibits significant antiangiogenic activity in several tumor models and enhances antitumor activity in combination with chemotherapy or targeted therapies.

Here we discuss an in-depth analysis of one of the reported gain-of-function ALK mutations\u2014ALKI1250T\u2014identified in the germ line DNA of one patient. Our analyses were performed in cell culture-based systems and subsequently confirmed in a Drosophila model. The results presented here indicate that the germ line ALKI1250T mutation is most probably not a determinant for tumor initiation or progression and, in contrast, seems to generate a kinase-dead mutation in the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). Consistent with this, stimulation with agonist ALK antibodies fails to lead to stimulation of ALKI1250T and we were unable to detect tyrosine phosphorylation under any circumstances. In agreement, ALKI1250T is unable to activate downstream signaling pathways or to mediate neurite outgrowth, in contrast to the activated wild-type ALK receptor or the activating ALKF1174S mutant. Identical results were obtained when the ALKI1250T mutant was expressed in a Drosophila model, confirming the lack of activity of this mutant ALK RTK. We suggest that the ALKI1250T mutation leads to a kinase-dead ALK RTK, in stark contrast to assumed gain-of-function status, with significant implications for patients reported to carry this particular ALK mutation.",

We found that human head and neck cancer (UMSCC1) xenografts responded significantly better in a schedule where cetuximab was administered after gemcitabine when compared with the schedule of cetuximab followed by gemcitabine. Wilcoxon two-sample tests suggested that the difference in tumor volumes in two schedules became significant on day 7 (P > .05 on day 4, and P < .05 on days 7 and 10), and the difference in activity of Akt in two schedules became significant on day 4 (P < .05 on days 4, 6, and 10). Using Akt reporter activity and cubic spline interpolation, the distinction between the two schedules could be detected 2 days before using the tumor volume, suggesting that molecular imaging of Akt may allow early prediction of therapy responsiveness. We did not observe a significant difference between the two schedules in the caspase-3 activity.

The alkylating agent temozolomide provides the greatest chemotherapeutic benefits currently available; however, glioblastoma patients cannot be cured. Novel drugs that efficiently combat glioblastomas are therefore of great interest. We report here that JLK1486, an 8-hydroxyquinoline-substituted benzylamine, could represent a novel chemical scaffold to reach this goal. Indeed, JLK1486 mediated anticancer activity in vivo (through intravenous as well as oral routes of administrations) in an orthotopic xenograft model and displayed efficiency similar to that of temozolomide. The therapeutic benefits of JLK1486 seem to relate to its ability to activate various transcription factors (including Myt1, STAT1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3) in glioma cells. These transcription factors are implicated in the control of glioma cell proliferation, and the resultant global effect of their activation by JLK1486 was cytostatic, not cytotoxic. Thus, the current study opens the door for the development of novel compounds to combat glioblastoma using 8-hydroxyquinoline benzylamine analogs.",

Most HCC and PC require extracellular sources of L-arg and undergo cell cycle arrest and apoptosis when L-arg is restricted. Systemic, enzyme-mediated depletion of L-arg has been investigated in mouse models and human trials. Non-human enzymes elicit neutralizing antibodies, whereas human arginases display poor pharmacological properties in serum. Co2+ substitution of the Mn2+ metal cofactor in human arginase I (Co-hArgI) was shown to confer more than 10-fold higher catalytic activity (kcat/Km) and 5-fold greater stability. We hypothesized that the Co-hArgI enzyme would decrease tumor burden by systemic elimination of L-arg in a murine model. Co-hArgI was conjugated to 5-kDa PEG (Co-hArgI-PEG) to enhance circulation persistence. It was used as monotherapy for HCC and PC in vitro and in vivo murine xenografts. The mechanism of cell death was also investigated. Weekly treatment of 8 mg/kg Co-hArgI-PEG effectively controlled human HepG2 (HCC) and Panc-1 (PC) tumor xenografts (P = .001 and P = .03, respectively). Both cell lines underwent apoptosis in vitro with significant increased expression of activated caspase-3 (P < .001). Furthermore, there was evidence of autophagy in vitro and in vivo. We have demonstrated that Co-hArgI-PEG is effective at controlling two types of L-arg-dependent carcinomas.

Growth assays in vitro revealed that the IC50 values were \u223c30 \u00b5M, \u223c3 nM, and \u223c6 nM, for EGCG, paclitaxel and docetaxel, respectively. Isobolograms generated from the data clearly indicated that EGCG in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel had an additive effect in blocking tumor cell growth. EGCG combined with taxane also had an additive effect to increase the expression of apoptotic genes, (p53, p73, p21, and caspase 3) and the percent apoptosis observed in vitro and in tumor modeling studies in severe combined immunodeficient mice. The tumor modeling studies clearly showed that EGCG plus taxane injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) induced a significant increase in apoptosis rates (TUNEL assays) and eliminated preexisting tumors generated from PC-3ML cells implanted i.p., increasing disease-free survival rates to greater than 90%. More importantly, the combination therapy (i.p. biweekly) blocked metastases after intravenous injection of PC-3ML cells through the tail vein. In mice treated with EGCG plus taxane, the disease-free survival rates increased from 0% (in untreated mice) to more than 70% to 80% in treated mice.

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer remains the single most prevalent cancer in men. Standard therapies are still limited and include androgen ablation that initially causes tumor regression. However, tumor cells eventually relapse and develop into a hormone-refractory prostate cancer. One of the current challenges in this disease is to define new therapeutic targets, which have been virtually unchanged in the past 30 years. Recent studies have suggested that the family of enzymes known as the proprotein convertases (PCs) is involved in various types of cancers and their progression. The present study examined PC expression in prostate cancer and validates one PC, namely PACE4, as a target. The evidence includes the observed high expression of PACE4 in all different clinical stages of human prostate tumor tissues. Gene silencing studies targeting PACE4 in the DU145 prostate cancer cell line produced cells (cell line 4-2) with slower proliferation rates, reduced clonogenic activity, and inability to grow as xenografts in nude mice. Gene expression and proteomic profiling of the 4-2 cell line reveals an increased expression of known cancer-related genes (e.g., GJA1, CD44, IGFBP6) that are downregulated in prostate cancer. Similarly, cancer genes whose expression is decreased in the 4-2 cell line were upregulated in prostate cancer (e.g., MUC1, IL6). The direct role of PACE4 in prostate cancer is most likely through the upregulated processing of growth factors or through the aberrant processing of growth factors leading to sustained cancer progression, suggesting that PACE4 holds a central role in prostate cancer.",

In the current study, we examine the immunologic impact of this intervention. Toward this goal, the infiltration and activation of lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor mass were assessed using flow cytometry. Moreover, the levels of IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 in homogenized tumor supernatants were determined. Moreover, mixed lymphocytes reaction using splenocytes of tumor-bearing mice was used to assess DC functionality on siRNA/lipopolyplexes intervention. Our results demonstrated up to an approximately fivefold induction in the infiltration of CD3+ cells in tumor mass on STAT3 knockdown with high levels of CD4+, CD8+, and NKT cells. Consistently, DC infiltration in tumor milieu increased up to approximately fourfold. Those DCs were activated, in an otherwise suppressive microenvironment, as evidenced by a high expression of costimulatory molecules CD86 and CD40. ELISA analysis revealed a significant increase in IFN-\u03b3, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1. Moreover, mixed lymphocytes reaction demonstrated alloreactivity of these DCs as assessed by high T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production. Our results suggest a bystander immune response after local STAT3 silencing by siRNA. This strategy could be beneficial as an adjuvant therapy along with current cancer vaccine formulations.",

However, cytoreductive surgery combined with hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is available for a selected group of PC patients, which significantly increases overall survival rates up to 30%.

Tumor targeting is expected to improve the treatment efficacy of colorectal cancer (CRC) further through 1) more sensitive preoperative tumor detection, thus reducing overtreatment; 2) better intraoperative detection and surgical elimination of residual disease using tumor-specific intraoperative imaging; and 3) tumor-specific targeted therapeutics. This review focuses, in particular, on the development of tumor-targeted imaging agents. A large number of biomarkers are known to be upregulated in CRC. However, to date, no validated criteria have been described for the selection of the most promising biomarkers for tumor targeting. Such a scoring system might improve the selection of the correct biomarker for imaging purposes. In this review, we present the TArget Selection Criteria (TASC) scoring system for selection of potential biomarkers for tumor-targeted imaging. By applying TASC to biomarkers for CRC, we identified seven biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen, CXC chemokine receptor 4, epidermal growth factor receptor, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, matrix metalloproteinases, mucin 1, and vascular endothelial growth factor A) that seem most suitable for tumor-targeted imaging applications in colorectal cancer. Further cross-validation studies in CRC and other tumor types are necessary to establish its definitive value.",

Protein and phosphorylated protein spots of interest were identified by mass spectrometry and validated by Western blot analysis as candidate markers for pancreatic cancer. We found that the expression and phosphorylation of Src family proteins were significantly higher in circulating MNCs from mice bearing pancreatic cancer than in circulating MNCs from healthy mice. TAMs in mice with pancreatic tumors also had higher Src family protein expression and phosphorylation than resident macrophages in the pancreas of healthy mice. The expression and phosphorylation of Src family proteins were correlated with tumor weight; however, increased Src expression and phosphorylation also occurred in MNCs from mice with chronic pancreatitis. This is the first report to explore novel pancreatic tumor markers in circulating MNCs.

Temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard chemotherapeutic to treat glioma patients. The present work aims to characterizeTMZ-induced effects on caveolin-1 expression in glioma cells. METHODS: Human astroglioma (U373 and T98G) and oligodendroglioma (Hs683) cell lines were used in vitro as well as in vivo orthotopic xenografts (Hs683 and U373) into the brains of immunocompromisedmice. In vitro TMZ-induced effects on protein expression and cellular localization were determined by Western blot analysis and on the actin cytoskeleton organization by means of immunofluorescence approaches. In vivo TMZ-induced effects in caveolin-1 expression in human glioma xenografts were monitored by means of immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: TMZ modified caveolin-1 expression and localization in vitro and in vivo after an administration schedule that slightly, if at all, impaired cell growth characteristics in vitro. Caveolin-1 by itself (at a 100-ng/ml concentration) was able to significantly reduce invasiveness (Boyden chambers) of the three human glioma cell lines. The TMZ-inducedmodification in caveolin-1 expression in flotation/raft compartments was paralleled by altered Cyr61 and \u03b21 integrin expression, two elements that have already been reported to collaborate with caveolin-1 in regulating glioma cell biology, and all these features led to profound reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. An experimental Src kinase inhibitor, AZD0530, almost completely antagonized the TMZ-induced modulation in caveolin-1 expression. CONCLUSION: TMZ modifies caveolin-1 expression in vitro and in vivo in glioma cells, a feature that directly affects glioma cell migration properties.",

SOCS-1 silencing with short hairpin RNA affected tumor growth and cell cycle regulation with arrest at the S phase with large-sized nuclei, reduced cell motility, and decreased melanoma cell invasion through Matrigel. A clonogenic assay showed that SOCS-1 acted as a modulator of resistance to anoikis. In addition, downregulation of SOCS-1 decreased the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (mainly the phosphorylated-R), Ins-R\u03b1, and fibroblast growth factor receptor. In vivo, silencing of SOCS-1 inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth and metastatic development in the lungs. Because SOCS-1 is expressed in most melanoma cell lines and bears a relation with tumor invasion, thickness, and stage of disease, the present results on the effects of SOCS-1 silencing in melanoma suggest that this regulating protein can be a target of cancer therapy.",

In the current study, kidney tumors were treated with this dose of sunitinib to modify the tumor microenvironment and enhance the effect of kidney tumor irradiation. The addition of soy isoflavones to this combined antiangiogenic and radiotherapy approach was investigated based on our studies demonstrating that soy isoflavones can potentiate the radiation effect on the tumors and act as antioxidants to protect normal tissues from treatment-induced toxicity. DCE-MRI was used to monitor vascular changes induced by sunitinib and schedule radiation when the uptake and washout of the contrast agent indicated regularization of blood flow. The combination of sunitinib with tumor irradiation and soy isoflavones significantly inhibited the growth and invasion of established kidney tumors and caused marked aberrations in the morphology of residual tumor cells. DCE-MRI studies demonstrated that the three modalities, sunitinib, radiation, and soy isoflavones, also exerted antiangiogenic effects resulting in increased uptake and clearance of the contrast agent. Interestingly, DCE-MRI and histologic observations of the normal contralateral kidneys suggest that soy could protect the vasculature of normal tissue from the adverse effects of sunitinib. An antiangiogenic approach that only partially destroys inefficient vessels could potentially increase the efficacy and delivery of cytotoxic therapies and radiotherapy for unresectable primary renal cell carcinoma tumors and metastatic disease.",

In view of normal functions of IL-22 signaling, we hypothesized that the aberrant expression of IL-22RA1 may contribute to the deregulation of various cell signaling pathways, thereby promoting cell growth in MCL. In this study, we first demonstrated the expression of IL-22RA1 in all three MCL cell lines and eight frozen tumors examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. In support of the concept that IL-22 signaling is biologically important in MCL, we found that MCL cells treated with recombinant IL-22 had a significant increase in cell growth that was associated with STAT3 activation. To investigate the mechanism underlying the aberrant expression of IL-22RA1, we analyzed the gene promoter of IL-22RA1, and we found multiple binding sites for NF-\u03baB, a transcriptional factor strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of MCL. Pharmacologic inhibition of NF-\u03baB resulted in a substantial reduction in the level of IL-22RA1 protein expression in MCL cells.

     "abstract": "Neovascularization is essential for tumor growth. We have previously reported that the chemokine receptor CXCR2 is an important regulator in tumor angiogenesis. Here we report that the mobilization of bone marrow (BM)-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is impaired in CXCR2 knockout mice harboring pancreatic cancers. The circulating levels of EPCs (positive for CD34, CD117, CD133, or CD146) are decreased in the bone marrow and/or blood of tumor-bearing CXCR2 knockout mice. CXCR2 gene knockout reduced BM-derived EPC proliferation, differentiation, and vasculogenesis in vitro. EPCs double positive for CD34 and CD133 increased tumor angiogenesis and pancreatic cancer growth in vivo. In addition, CD133+ and CD146+ EPCs in human pancreatic cancer are increased compared with normal pancreas tissue. These findings indicate a role of BM-derived EPC in pancreatic cancer growth and provide a cellular mechanism for CXCR2 mediated tumor neovascularization.",

     "abstract": "Currently, there is no adequate technology to detect early stage ovarian cancers. Most of the cancers in the ovary are detected when the cancer has already metastasized to other parts of the body. As a result, ovarian cancer has the highest mortality of all gynecologic cancers with a 5-year survival rate of 30% or less. Thus, there is an urgent need to improve the current diagnostic techniques. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is an emerging modality with a great potential to assist ultrasound for detecting ovarian cancer noninvasively. In this article, we report the first study of coregistered ultrasound and PAI of 33 ex vivo human ovaries. An assessment of the photoacoustic images has revealed light absorption distribution in the ovary, which is directly related to the vasculature distribution and amount. Quantification of the light absorption levels in the ovary has indicated that, in the postmenopausal group, malignant ovaries showed significantly higher light absorption than normal ones (P = .0237). For these two groups, we have obtained a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 83%. This result suggests that PAI is a promising modality for improving ultrasound diagnosis of ovarian cancer.",

     "abstract": "RON belongs to the c-MET family of receptor tyrosine kinases. As its well-known family member MET, RON and its ligand macrophage-stimulating protein have been implicated in the progression and metastasis of tumors and have been shown to be overexpressed in cancer. We generated and tested a large number of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human RON. Our screening yielded three high-affinity antibodies that efficiently block ligand-dependent intracellular AKT and MAPK signaling. This effect correlates with the strong reduction of ligand-activated migration of T47D breast cancer cell line. By cross-competition experiments, we showed that the antagonistic antibodies fall into three distinct epitope regions of the RON extracellular Sema domain. Notably, no inhibition of tumor growth was observed in different epithelial tumor xenografts in nude mice with any of the antibodies. These results suggest that distinct properties beside ligand antagonism are required for anti-RON mAbs to exert antitumor effects in vivo.",

Within this scope, we investigated the effect of SRC/STAT pathway components on LA-SCCHN patient outcome. SRC, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, ANXA1, CAV1, IGFBP2, EPHA2, EPHB2, and MSN relative gene expression, as well as Stat protein activation, were assessed on LA-SCCHN tumor tissues from 35 patients treated with combined radiotherapy (RT) and CTX-based regimens. Stat1, Stat3, and Stat5 proteins were usually found activated in neoplastic nuclei (70.4%, 85.7%, and 70.8%, respectively). Activated Stat3 and Stat5 were associated with each other (P = .017) and with a CAV1high/MSNhigh/IGFBP2low profile. All patients with tumors expressing high STAT5A/EPHA2 experienced a complete response on RT-CTX-based treatments (12/15 complete responders, P < .0001) and a longer progression-free survival (P = .024). Few tumors expressed high ANXA1/CAV1/EPHA2 and low IGFBP2, a putative dasatinib response-related profile, whereas high ANXA1 was associated with shorter overall survival (P = .003). In conclusion, Stat activation is common in LA-SCCHN, where overexpression of STAT5A and EPHA2 may predict for response to RT-CTX treatments. The STAT5A/EPHA2 profile seems of particular interest for validation in larger cohorts and in multiple tumor types because markers for the positive selection of patients to benefit from CTX-containing treatments are currently lacking.",

With an improved understanding of the molecular basis for this disease, the opportunity to develop novel treatments with more tolerable toxicity profiles that target key molecular pathways, now exists. Recently, the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/MET signaling pathway has been implicated in medulloblastoma pathogenesis. Several therapeutic strategies targeting this pathway exist, including small molecule inhibitor therapy against the MET receptor tyrosine kinase. We examined the in vitro efficacy of targeting the MET receptor using the highly specific small molecule inhibitor PHA665752 as a novel treatment strategy in medulloblastoma. MET inhibition using PHA665752 was effective at reducing the proliferative capacity of the D283, ONS76, and MED8A medulloblastoma cell lines as assessed by MTS assay. Furthermore, PHA665752 treatment reduced D283 and ONS76 cell motility and impaired the growth of D283 cells in soft agar. Pretreatment of D283, ONS76, and MED8A cells with PHA665752 blocked exogenous recombinant human HGF-induced up-regulation of the downstream RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway in D283, ONS76 and MED8A cell lines. Similarly, PHA665752 prevented HGF-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT signaling in ONS76 and MED8A cells. These results highlight the efficacy of targeting the MET receptor tyrosine kinase therapeutically in medulloblastoma and provide support for further preclinical testing of small molecule inhibitors targeting the MET receptor in medulloblastoma.",

We performed intercrosses between twist-null/+ and Apc1638N/+ mice and studied their progeny. The Apc1638N/+;twistnull/+ mice developed bone abnormalities observed by macroscopic skeletal analyses and in vivo imaging. Complementary histologic, cellular, and molecular analyses were used to characterize the identified bone tumors, including cell culture and immunofluorescence of bone differentiation markers. Spontaneous localized malignant bone tumors were frequently identified in Apc1638N/+;twist-null/+ mice by in vivo imaging evaluation and histologic analyses. These tumors possessed several features similar to those observed in human localized osteosarcomas. In particular, the murine tumors presented with fibroblastic, chondroblastic, and osteoblastic osteosarcoma histologies, as well as mixtures of these subtypes. In addition, cellular analyses and bone differentiation markers detected by immunofluorescence on tumor sections reproduced most murine and human osteosarcoma characteristics. For example, the early bone differentiation marker Runx2, interacting physically with hypophosphorylated pRb, was undetectable in these murine osteosarcomas, whereas phosphorylated retinoblastoma was abundant in the osteoblastic and chondroblastic tumor subtypes. These characteristics, similar to those observed in human osteosarcomas, indicated that our animal model may be a powerful tool to further understand the development of localized osteosarcoma.",

Although CCR7 has been implicated in targeting the metastasis of cancers to lymph nodes, the role of CCR7 in the metastasis of breast cancer, along with the molecular mechanisms that are controlled by CCR7 that target breast cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes, has yet to be defined. To explore the cellular and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer cell migration to the lymph nodes, we used the mouse MMTV-PyVmT mammary tumor cells (PyVmT) transfected with CCR7 and the human CCR7-expressing MCF10A and MCF7 mammary cell lines. We found that the CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21, controlled cell migration using the \u03b21-integrin heterodimeric adhesion molecules. To define a physiological significance for CCR7 regulation of migration, we used the FVB syngeneic mouse model of metastatic breast cancer. When CCR7-negative PyVmT cells transfected with control vector were orthotopically transferred to the mammary fat pad of FVB mice, tumors metastasized to the lungs (10/10 mice) but not to the lymph nodes (0/10). In contrast, CCR7-expressing PyVmT (CCR7-PyVmT) cells metastasized to the lymph nodes (6/10 mice) and had a reduced rate of metastasis to the lungs (4/10 mice). CCR7-PyVmT tumors grew significantly faster than PyVmT tumors, which mirrored the growth in vitro, of CCR7-PyVmT, MCF7, and MCF10A mammospheres. This model provides tools for studying lymph node metastasis, CCR7 regulation of tumor cell growth, and targeting of breast cancer cells to the lymph nodes.",

In a phase 0 exploratory study, we used dynamic, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging to assess the extremes of lymphatic architecture and transport in healthy human subjects and in subjects clinically diagnosed with unilateral lymphedema (LE), a disease that can be prevalent in cancer survivors. METHODS AND RESULTS: Active lymphatic propulsion was imaged after intradermal injections of 25 \u00b5g of indocyanine green (total maximum dose \u2264400 \u00b5g) bilaterally in the arms or legs of control and subjects. Images show well-defined lymphatic structures with propulsive dye transport in limbs of healthy subjects. In LE subjects, we observed extravascular dye accumulation, networks of fluorescent lymphatic capillaries, and/or tortuous lymphatic vessels in all symptomatic and some asymptomatic limbs. Statistical models indicate that disease status and/or limb significantly affect parameters of apparent lymph propagation velocity and contractile frequency. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical research studies demonstrate the potential of NIR fluorescence imaging as a diagnostic measure of functional lymphatics and as a new tool in translational research studies to decipher the role of the lymphatic system in cancer and other diseases.",

We conducted a prospective trial to determine the safety profile and recommended phase 2 dose of erlotinib and capecitabine given concurrently with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) in resected pancreatic cancer patients. The pharmacokinetic profile of this combination was also evaluated. METHODS: Patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma received erlotinib and capecitabine concurrently with IMRT delivered at 1.8 Gy daily in 28 fractions (total = 50.4 Gy). The starting dose level (DL 1) was erlotinib 150mgdaily and capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily without interruption. The next lower dose level (DL -1) was erlotinib 100 mg daily and capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily (Monday to Friday). Plasma samples were obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis. RESULTS: Thirteen patients were enrolled in total. At DL 1, six of the seven treated patients were evaluable for toxicities. Four completed planned treatment, but all required treatment interruption or dose reduction. The dose-limiting toxicities were neutropenia, diarrhea, and rash. Six patients were subsequently enrolled to and completed planned treatment in DL-1. Themost common toxicities were fatigue, elevated liver enzymes, and anorexia. The pharmacokinetic parameters of erlotinib and OSI-420 were not significantly different in the presence or absence of capecitabine and were consistent with historical controls. CONCLUSIONS: When administered concurrently with IMRT, erlotinib 100 mg daily and capecitabine 800 mg/m2 twice daily (Monday to Friday) can be administered safely in resected pancreas cancer patients, and is the recommended regimen for efficacy studies using this regimen.",

Parallel experiments with murine peritoneal macrophages produced identical results. Neither activated microglia nor activated macrophages lysed nontumorigenic murine or human cells.

In this study, we have evaluated the therapeutic potential of sulforaphane (SFN), an antioxidant derived from broccoli, in BEAC. METHODS: BEAC cells were treated with SFN, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutic, paclitaxel, or telomerase-inhibiting agents (MST-312, GRN163L), and live cell number determined at various time points. The effect on drug resistance/chemosensitivity was evaluated by rhodamine efflux assay. Apoptosis was detected by annexin V labeling and Western blot analysis of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Effects on genes implicated in cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by Western blot analyses. To evaluate the efficacy in vivo, BEAC cells were injected subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient mice, and after the appearance of palpable tumors, mice were treated with SFN. RESULTS: SFN induced both time- and dose-dependent decline in cell survival, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. The treatment with SFN also suppressed the expression of multidrug resistance protein, reduced drug efflux, and increased anticancer activity of other antiproliferative agents including paclitaxel. A significant reduction in tumor volume was also observed by SFN in a subcutaneous tumor model of BEAC. Anticancer activity could be attributed to the induction of caspase 8 and p21 and down-regulation of hsp90, a molecular chaperon required for activity of several proliferation-associated proteins. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that a natural product with antioxidant properties from broccoli has great potential to be used in chemoprevention and treatment of BEAC.",

We have previously shown that lupulone induces apoptosis in SW480 cells, through a cross talk between the TRAIL-death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. In SW620 cells, lupulone induced apoptosis only through TRAIL-death receptor activation. Both cell lines exhibit the same p53 mutations. Because p53 plays a central role in the response to cellular stresses by upregulating the transcription of several genes controlling apoptosis, we aimed to study the involvement of p53 on lupulone-triggered apoptosis. Our data show that in SW620 cells, lupulone upregulated p53 gene expression and caused a cloistering of p53 in the nucleus, allowing p53 to play a proapoptotic role by activating the TRAIL-death receptor pathway. In contrast, in lupulone-treated SW480 cells, p53 was translocated to the cytoplasm where it initiated a survival response associated with the up-regulation of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins in an attempt to preserve mitochondrial integrity. These prosurvival effects of p53 in lupulone-treated SW480 cells were reversed by pifithrin-\u03b1, an inhibitor of p53 function, which caused a blocking of p53 in the nucleus leading to the down-regulation of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1, the up-regulation of proapoptotic Bax protein and TRAIL-death receptors leading to enhanced cell death. Our data support different functions of the same mutated p53 in colon adenocarcinoma and derived metastatic cells in response to the chemopreventive agent lupulone.",

     "abstract": "In an attempt to develop better therapeutic approaches for metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the combination of the antiangiogenic drug sunitinib with gemcitabine was studied. Using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), we have previously determined that a sunitinib dosage of 20 mg/kg per day increased kidney tumor perfusion and decreased vascular permeability in a preclinical murine RCC model. This sunitinib dosage causing regularization of tumor vessels was selected to improve delivery of gemcitabine to the tumor. DCE-MRI was used to monitor regularization of vasculature with sunitinib in kidney tumors to schedule gemcitabine. We established an effective and nontoxic schedule of sunitinib combined with gemcitabine consisting of pretreatment with sunitinib for 3 days followed by four treatments of gemcitabine at 20 mg/kg given 3 days apart while continuing daily sunitinib treatment. This treatment caused significant tumor growth inhibition resulting in small residual tumor nodules exhibiting giant tumor cells with degenerative changes, which were observed both in kidney tumors and in spontaneous lung metastases, suggesting a systemic antitumor response. The combined therapy caused a significant increase in mouse survival. DCE-MRI monitoring of vascular changes induced by sunitinib, gemcitabine, and both combined showed increased tumor perfusion and decreased vascular permeability in kidney tumors. These findings, confirmed histologically by thinning of tumor blood vessels, suggest that both sunitinib and gemcitabine exert antiangiogenic effects in addition to cytotoxic antitumor activity.

METHODS: (64Cu-DOTA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m was synthesized, characterized, and administered to female Balb/c mice subcutaneously inoculated with highly metastatic 4T1.2neu/R breast cancer cells. (64Cu-DOTA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m (150 \u00b5g, 150 \u00b5Ci, m = 2, n = 2) was administered through the tail vein at weeks 2 and 6 after implantation, and PET/computed tomography and NIR fluorescence imaging were performed 24 hours later. Results were compared with the detection capabilities of F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18FDG-PET). RESULTS: Primary tumors were visualized with 18FDG and (64Cu-DOTA)n-trastuzumab-(IRDye800)m, but resulting metastases were identified only with the dual-labeled imaging agent. 64Cu-PET imaging detected lung metastases, whereas ex vivo NIR fluorescence showed uptake in regions of lung, skin, skeletal muscle, and lymph nodes, which corresponded with the presence of cancer cells as confirmed by histologic hematoxylin and eosin stains. In addition to detecting the agent in lymph nodes, the high signal-to-noise ratio from NIR fluorescence imaging enabled visualization of channels between the primary tumor and the axillary lymph nodes, suggesting a lymphatic route for trafficking cancer cells. Because antibody clearance occurs through the liver, we could not distinguish between nonspecific uptake and liver metastases.

We examined the activity of AEE788, a dual inhibitor of human epidermal receptor (HER) 1/2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 1/2, in medulloblastoma preclinical models. Established lines (Daoy and D283), chemoresistant (DaoyPt), and ectopically HER2-overexpressing (DaoyHER2) cells expressed diverse levels of total and activated AEE788 target receptors. In vitro, AEE788 inhibited cell proliferation (IC50 from 1.7 to 3.8 \u00b5M) and prevented epidermal growth factor- and neuregulin-induced HER1, HER2, and HER3 activation. Inhibition of Akt paralleled that of HER receptors. In vivo, AEE788 growth inhibited Daoy, DaoyPt, and DaoyHER2 xenografts by 51%, 45%, and 72%, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis of mock- and HER2-transfected xenografts revealed that the latter showed, along with high HER2 expression, high VEGFR2 staining in tumor and endothelial cells and increased expression of the endothelial marker CD31. AEE788 reduced the activation of target receptors and angiogenesis. In 21 primary medulloblastoma, HER2 expression significantly correlated (P < .01) with VEGFR2 (r = 0.56) and VEGF (r = 0.61). In conclusion, AEE788 shows similar growth-suppressive activities in chemosensitive and chemoresistant medulloblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Ectopic HER2 overexpression sensitizes cells to AEE788 in vivo, but not in vitro, possibly through host-mediated processes. Together with the experimental data, the finding that HER2 positively correlates with VEGFR2 and VEGF in human medulloblastoma specimens indicates HER2-overexpressing medulloblastoma as the subset that most likely might benefit from AEE788 treatment.",

Forced expression of ARTN in endometrial carcinoma cells decreased sensitivity to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Accordingly, depletion of ARTN by small interfering RNA or functional inhibition of ARTN with antibodies significantly increased sensitivity of endometrial carcinoma cells to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Forced expression of ARTN in endometrial carcinoma cells abrogated doxorubicin-induced G2-M arrest and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. ARTN increased CD24 expression in endometrial carcinoma cells by transcriptional up-regulation, and CD24 was partially correlated to ARTN expression in endometrial carcinoma. Forced expression of CD24 in endometrial carcinoma cells stimulated cell proliferation and oncogenicity, enhanced cell invasion, and decreased sensitivity to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. Depletion of CD24 in endometrial carcinoma cells abrogated ARTN-stimulated resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel. ARTN-stimulated resistance to doxorubicin and paclitaxel in endometrial carcinoma cells is therefore mediated by the specific regulation of CD24. Functional inhibition of ARTN may therefore be considered as an adjuvant therapeutic approach to improve the response of endometrial carcinoma to specific chemotherapeutic agents.",

     "abstract": "A third of patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) present ascites. The cellular fraction of ascites often consists of EOC cells, lymphocytes, and mesothelial cells, whereas the acellular fraction contains cytokines and angiogenic factors. Clinically, the presence of ascites correlates with intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal tumor spread. We have used OV-90, a tumorigenic EOC cell line derived from the malignant ascites of a chemonaive ovarian cancer patient, as a model to assess the effect of ascites on migration potential using an in vitro wound-healing assay. A recent report of an invasion assay described the effect of ascites on the invasion potential of the OV-90 cell line. Ascites sampled from 31 ovarian cancer patients were tested and compared with either 5% fetal bovine serum or no serum for their nonstimulatory or stimulatory effect on the migration potential of the OV-90 cell line. A supervised analysis of data generated by the Affymetrix HG-U133A GeneChip identified differentially expressed genes from OV-90 cells exposed to ascites that had either a nonstimulatory or a stimulatory effect on migration. Ten genes (IRS2, CTSD, NRAS, MLXIP, HMGCR, LAMP1, ETS2, NID1, SMARCD1, and CD44) were upregulated in OV-90 cells exposed to ascites, allowing a nonstimulatory effect on cell migration. These findings were validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, the gene expression of IRS2 and MLXIP each correlated with prognosis when their expression was assessed in an independent set of primary cultures established from ovarian ascites. This study revealed novel candidates that may play a role in ovarian cancer cell migration.",

Recently, the SEPT9 isoform SEPT9_v1 has been implicated in oncogenesis, and methylation of the SEPT9 promoter region was reported in HNSCC. These findings led us to hypothesize that SEPT9_v1 could be differently expressed in HNSCC. To determine whether SEPT9_v1 is expressed in HNSCC, tissue microarray immunohistochemical analysis was performed using a SEPT9_v1-specific antibody. Tissue microarrays stained with a polyclonal SEPT9_v1-specific antibody was used to determine protein expression levels in HNSCC tissue samples, some with known clinical outcomes. This analysis showed that SEPT9_v1 is in fact highly expressed in HNSCC compared with normal epithelium, and high expression levels directly correlated with poor clinical outcomes. Specifically, a high SEPT9_v1 expression was associated with decreased disease-specific survival (P = .012), time to indication of surgery at primary site (P = .008), response to induction chemotherapy (P = .0002), and response to chemotherapy (P = .02), as well as advanced tumor stage (P = .012) and N stage (P = .0014). The expression of SEPT9_v1 was also strongly correlated with smoking status (P = .00094). SEPT9_v1 is highly expressed in HNSCC, and a high expression of SEPT9_v1 is associated with poor clinical outcomes. These data indicate that SEPT9_v1 warrants additional investigation as a potential biomarker for HNSCC.",

Relapsed cancers including neuroblastoma are generally chemotherapy-resistant and carry a very poor prognosis. We investigated the side populations of three pairs of neuroblastoma cell lines derived from single patients at the time of their initial presentation and then at relapse after multimodality therapy. We found that the size of the side populations in the relapsed cell lines was significantly increased compared with its paired pretreatment cell line. In addition, these side population cells showed increased proliferation and were significantly more efficient at forming colonies in soft agar than their prerelapse pair. Gene expression analysis of the stem cell genes NANOG and POU5F1 (Oct3/4) showed increased expression in the unsorted relapsed cell lines compared with pretreatment lines as well as in the side populations of the relapsed versus prerelapse cell line pairs. The increased size, proliferative ability, and colony-forming efficiency of the side populations of the postrelapse cell lines demonstrated in this study suggest that a population of stemlike cells is not being efficiently targeted by conventional therapy and implies that strategies to specifically target the stem cell fraction of neuroblastomas are needed to improve outcomes in this devastating childhood disease.",

Docetaxel is an antitumor agent that leads to mitotic arrest, apoptosis, and mitotic catastrophe cell death. Gene expression analysis was performed to detect altered regulation in gene expression pathways related to docetaxel treatment effects. Histopathology was used as a measure of alterations in apoptosis and proliferation due to docetaxel. Experiments were performed using MCF7 mouse xenografts, randomized into a docetaxel (30 mg/kg) treatment group and a control group given saline. MRI/MRS was performed 1 day before treatment and 1, 3, and 6 days after treatment. Parametric images of the extracellular extravascular volume fraction (ve) transfer constant (Ktrans) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were calculated from the DCE-MRI and DW-MRI data. Biopsies were analyzed by HR MAS MRS, and histopathology and gene expression profiles were determined (Illumina). A significant increase in the ADC 3 and 6 days after treatment and a significant decrease in total choline and a higher ve were found in treated tumors 6 days after treatment. No significant difference was found in the Ktrans between the two groups. Our results show that docetaxel induces apoptosis and decreases proliferation in MCF7 xenografts.

Tumor models were declared sensitive (murine melanoma B16/BL6 and human lung H596) or relatively insensitive (human colon HCT116 and cervical KB31), according to the IC50 values (concentration inhibiting cell growth by 50%) for inhibition of proliferation in vitro (<10 nM and >1 \u00b5M, respectively). Everolimus strongly inhibited growth of the sensitive models in vivo but also significantly inhibited growth of the insensitive models, an effect attributable to its known anti-angiogenic/vascular properties. However, although tumor FDG and FLT uptake was significantly reduced in the sensitive models, it was not affected in the insensitive models, suggesting that endothelial-directed effects could not be detected by these PET tracers. Consistent with this hypothesis, in a well-vascularized orthotopic rat mammary tumor model, other antiangiogenic agents also failed to affect FDG uptake, despite inhibiting tumor growth. In contrast, the cytotoxic patupilone, a microtubule stabilizer, blocked tumor growth, and markedly reduced FDG uptake. These results suggest that FDG/FLT-PET may not be a suitable method for early markers of response to antiangiogenic agents and mTOR inhibitors in which anti-angiogenic/vascular effects predominate because the method could provide false-negative responses.

     "abstract": "Enhanced expression and activity of cSrc are associated with ovarian cancer progression. Generally, cSrc does not contain activating mutations; rather, its activity is increased in response to signals that affect a conformational change that releases its autoinhibition. In this report, we analyzed ovarian cancer tissues for the expression of a cSrc-activating protein, AFAP-110. AFAP-110 activates cSrc through a direct interaction that releases it from its autoinhibited conformation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a concomitant increase of AFAP-110 and cSrc in ovarian cancer tissues. An analysis of the AFAP-110 coding sequence revealed the presence of a nonsynonymous, single-nucleotide polymorphism that resulted in a change of Ser403 to Cys403. In cells that express enhanced levels of cSrc, AFAP-110403C directed the activation of cSrc and the formation of podosomes independently of input signals, in contrast to wild-type AFAP-110. We therefore propose that, under conditions of cSrc overexpression, the polymorphic variant of AFAP-110 promotes cSrc activation. Further, these data indicate amechanismby which an inherited genetic variation could influence ovarian cancer progression and could be used to predict the response to targeted therapy.",

Here, we investigate the resistance of breast CSC to CPA alone in a xenograft model. CPA treatment led to a 48% reduction in tumor volume during a 2-week period. Cells bearing the CD44+ CD24\u2212 phenotype were reduced by 90% (2.5% to 0.24%) in CPA-treated tumors, whereas cells with aldehyde dehydrogenase activity were reduced by 64% (4.7% to 1.7%). A subsequent functional analysis showed that CPA-treated tumors were impaired in their ability to form tumors, indicating loss of functional tumor-initiating activity. These results are consistent with a CSC phenotype that is sensitive to CPA and indicate that some patient CSC may not display the expected resistance to therapy.

In an attempt to create clinically relevant models for studying treatments directed against pancreatic cancer, we have defined a methodology to measure the effect of varying doses of radiation in established human pancreatic cancer orthotopic xenografts using two different pancreatic cancer cell lines (Panc-1 and BXPC3) infected with a lentiviral vector expressing CMV promoter-driven luciferase to allow bioluminescence imaging of live animals in real time. Quantifiable photon emission from luciferase signaling in vivo correlated well with actual tumor growth. Bioluminescence imaging of the established pancreatic xenografts was used to direct delivery of radiation to the orthotopic tumors and minimize off-target adverse effects. Growth delay was observed with schedules in the range of 7.5 Gy in five fractions to 10 Gy in four fractions, whereas doses 3 Gy or higher produced toxic adverse effects. In conclusion, we describe a model in which the effects of ionizing radiation, alone or in combination with other therapeutics, in orthotopic xenografts, can be studied.",

Frozen tumor tissue sections were fluorescence-stained for nuclei (Hoechst 33342), hypoxia (anti-EF5 antibodies), and proliferation (anti-Ki-67 antibodies). EF5 binding adjacent to Ki-67+ cells, overall EF5 binding, the ratio of these values, and the proliferation indexwere evaluated. Patients were classified using recursive partitioning analysis and followed up until recurrence and/or death. Recursive partitioning analysis was statistically significant for survival (P = .0026). Overall EF5 binding, EF5 binding near Ki-67+ cells, and proliferation index did not predict recurrence. Two additional survival analyses based on ratios of the overall EF5 binding to EF5 binding near Ki-67+ cells were performed. High and low ratio values were determined by two cutoff points: (a) the 50% value for the ratio [EF5/Ki-67Binding]/[Tumorbinding] = RatioEF5 50% and (b) the median EF5 value (75.6%) of the ratio [EF5/Ki-67Binding]/[Tumorbinding] = Ratiopatients median. On the basis of the RatioEF5 50%, recurrence (P = .0074) and survival (P = .0196) could be predicted. Using the Ratiopatients median, only survival could be predicted (P = .0291). In summary, patients had a worse prognosis if the [EF5/Ki-67Binding]/[Tumorbinding] ratio was high. A hypothesis for the mechanisms and translational significance of these findings is discussed.",

Dissemination through lymphatic vessels represents an early step in regional tumor progression, and the presence of lymphatic metastasis is associated with a poor prognosis. In patients who have undergone a radical hysterectomy, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI), assessed on hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides, is a major factor for adjuvant therapy in patients with cervical cancer. With the advent of a lymphatic endothelial cell-specific marker, such as D2-40, it is now possible to distinguish between blood and lymphatic space invasion (LSI). In this study, the utility of D2-40 was assessed for the detection of lymphatic vessel density (LVD) and identification of LSI. The expressions of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-3 (VEGFR-3), VEGF-C, tyrosine receptor kinase-2, and angiopoietin-1 were assessed by immunohistochemical methods on 50 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix. Clinicopathologic characteristics, including pelvic lymph node metastasis, were correlated with the above histochemical findings. We found that lymphangiogenesis, measured by an increase in peritumoral LVD, was significantly associated with positive lymph node status ( .005). VEGFR-3 expression was significantly associated with LVD (P < .05). D2-40 staining verified LSI (P = .03) and surpassed that of hematoxylin and eosin-identified LVSI (P = 54). In conclusion, lymphangiogenic markers, specifically LVD quantified by D2-40 and VEGFR-3, are independently associated with LSI and lymph node metastasis in patients with early squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy.",

We demonstrate that MPM/SHG of intrinsic tissue emissions allows visualization of unfixed, unsectioned, and unstained tissues at a resolution comparable to that of routinely processed histologic sections. In addition to permitting discrimination between normal and neoplastic tissues according to pathological criteria, the method facilitates morphometric assessment of specimens and detection of very early cellular changes in the ovarian surface epithelium. A red shift in cellular intrinsic fluorescence and collagen structural alterations have been identified as additional cancer-associated changes that are indiscernible by conventional pathologic techniques. Importantly, the feasibility of in vivo laparoscopic MPM/SHG is demonstrated by using a \u201cstick\u201d objective lens. Intravital detection of neoplastic lesions has been further facilitated by low-magnification identification of an indicator for cathepsin activity followed by MPM laparoscopic imaging. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MPM may be translatable to clinical settings as an endoscopic approach suitable for high-resolution optical biopsies as well as a pathology tool for rapid initial assessment of ovarian cancer samples.",

These alterations cause androgen-dependent ERG transcription factor expression in PC patients. We and others have shown that chemokine receptor CXCR4 expression is upregulated in PC tumor cells, and its ligand, CXCL12, is expressed in bone stromal cells. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis functions in PC progression to enhance invasion and metastasis. To address the regulation of CXCR4 expression, we identified several putative ERG consensus-binding sites in the promoter region of CXCR4. We hypothesized that androgen-dependent regulation of the ERG transcription factor could induce CXCR4 expression in PC cells. Results of the current study show that 1) prostate tumor cells coexpress higher ERG and CXCR4 compared with benign tissue, 2) CXCR4 expression is increased in the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive cell line, 3) ERG transcription factor binds to the CXCR4 gene promoter, 4) synthetic androgen (81881) upregulates both ERG and CXCR4 in TMPRSS2-ERG fusion-positive VCaP cells, 5) small interfering RNA-mediated down-regulation of ERG resulted in the loss of androgen-dependent regulation of CXCR4 expression in VCaP cells, and 6) 81881-activated TMPRSS2-ERG expression functionally activates CXCR4 in VCaP cells.

These properties have rendered it to be a clinically active drug, with subsequent registration in renal cell carcinoma (Motzer et al. [2008].

Although everolimus has a high specificity for its molecular target, the ubiquitous nature of mTOR and the multifactorial influence that mTOR signaling has on cell physiology have made studies difficult on the identification and validation of a biomarker set to predict and monitor drug sensitivity for clinical use. In this review, a summary of the preclinical and clinical data relevant to biomarker development for everolimus is presented, and the advantages and problems of current biomarkers are reviewed. In addition, alternative approaches to biomarker development are proposed on the basis of examples of a combination of markers and functional noninvasive imaging.

To evaluate the possible role played by KGF in affecting the behavior of different subtypes of melanoma carrying activating mutations or overexpression of the SCF receptor c-KIT, we used human melanoma cell lines, characterized by different expression levels of c-KIT and opposing responsivity to SCF, and HaCaT keratinocytes. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay and ELISA test on KGF-treated keratinocytes showed enhanced expression and secretion of SCF in response to KGF and dependent on functional KGF receptor.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the expression patterns of additional lipid metabolic enzymes in human breast and prostate cancers. This was accomplished by analysis of published expression databases, with confirmation by immunoblot assays. Our results indicate that the fatty acid-activating enzyme, long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4), is differentially expressed in human breast cancer as a function of estrogen receptor alpha (ER) status. In 10 separate studies, ACSL4 messenger RNA (mRNA) was overexpressed in ER-negative breast tumors. Of 50 breast cancer cell lines examined, 17 (89%) of 19 ER-positive lines were negative for ACSL4 mRNA expression and 20 (65%) of 31 ER-negative lines expressed ACSL4 mRNA. The inverse relationship between ER expression and ACSL4 expression was also observed for androgen receptor status in both breast and prostate cancers. Furthermore, loss of steroid hormone sensitivity, such as that observed in Raf1-transfected MCF-7 cells and LNCaP-AI cells, was associated with induction of ACSL4 expression. Ablation of ACSL4 expression inMDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells had no effect on cell proliferation; however, sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of triacsin C was increased three-fold in the cells lacking ACSL4.",

We investigated the effects of curcumin on NF-\u03baB activity, on cell viability, and as a chemosensitizing agent with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin (CDDP) in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). Oligonucleotide microarray analysis of 46 cases, consisting of Barrett metaplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and EAC, showed increased expression of NF-\u03baB and I\u03baB kinase subunits and decreased effector caspase expression in EAC compared with Barrett metaplasia. Stromal expression of both I\u03baB and phospho-I\u03baB was detected in several EAC samples by tissue microarray analysis. Curcumin alone inhibited NF-\u03baB activity and induced apoptosis in both Flo-1 and OE33 EAC cell lines as determined by Western blot analysis, NF-\u03baB reporter assays, and Caspase-Glo 3/7 assays. It also increased 5-FU- and CDDP-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. These data suggest that activation of NF-\u03baB and inhibition of apoptosis may play a role in the progression from Barrett metaplasia to EAC. In addition, curcumin, a well-known inhibitor of NF-\u03baB activity, was shown to increase apoptosis and enhance both 5-FU- and CDDP-mediated chemosensitivity, suggesting that it may have potential application in the therapy of patients with EAC.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNA are small noncoding transcripts involved in many cellular mechanisms, including tumorigenesis. miR-210, in particular, is induced by hypoxia and correlates with adverse outcomes in certain cancers. Because pancreatic adenocarcinomas exhibit extremely hypoxic signatures, we hypothesized that miR-210 may serve as a diagnostic marker for screening or surveillance for pancreatic cancer. Plasma samples were obtained from newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer patients and age-matched noncancer controls. miRNA was extracted directly from plasma and reverse-transcribed to complementary DNA. A known quantity of synthetic Caenorhabditis elegans miR-54 (celmiR-54) was added for normalization. miR-210 and cel-miR-54 were then measured using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. An initial cohort of 11 pancreatic cancer patients and 14 age-matched controls was used as the test set and a second cohort of 11 pancreatic cancer patients and 11 controls was used as the validating set in this study. miR-210 was reliably detected and quantified, with a statistically significant four-fold increase in expression in pancreatic cancer patients compared with normal controls (P < .00004) in the test set. This difference was confirmed in the validation group (P < .018). In summary, circulating miR-210 levels are elevated in pancreatic cancer patients and may potentially serve as a useful biomarker for pancreatic cancer diagnosis.",

     "publication date": "04-2010",
     "abstract": "The immunomodulatory effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) have been reported in several photosensitizers. Pheophorbide a (Pa), a chlorophyll derivative, shows antitumor effects on a number of human cancers in a PDT approach (Pa-PDT); however, the potential effect of Pa-PDT on the anticancer immunity has never been studied. In the present work, the underlying action mechanism of Pa-PDT was systemically investigated with a human hepatoma cell line HepG2. We found that Pa-PDT significantly inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells with a half maximal inhibitory concentration/endoplasmic reticulum of 0.35 \u00b5M at 24 hours by the induction of apoptosis, as shown by externalization of phosphatidylserine, release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, and activation of the caspases cascade in the treated cells. Interestingly, using two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, a 57-kDa disulfide-isomerase-like ER resident protein (ERp57) that belongs to the HLA class I-restricted antigen-processing machinery was found to be mediated during the Pa-PDT treatment. This activation of antigen presentation was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunostaining. Furthermore, a cross-presentation of antigen with HLA class I proteins and 70-kDa heat shock protein was found in Pa-PDT-treated cells, as shown by the confocal microscopic observation and immunoprecipitation assay. Nevertheless, the immunogenicity of HepG2 cells was increased by Pa-PDT treatment that triggered phagocytic capture by human macrophages. Our findings provide the first evidence that Pa-PDT can trigger both apoptosis and cancer immunity in the tumor host.",

     "publication date": "04-2010",
     "abstract": "Under physiological conditions, transferrin receptor 2 (TfR2) is expressed in the liver and its balance is related to the cell cycle rather than to intracellular iron levels. We recently showed that TfR2 is highly expressed in glioblastoma cell lines. Here, we demonstrate that, in these cells, TfR2 appears to localize in lipid rafts, induces extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation after transferrin binding, and contributes to cell proliferation, as shown by RNA silencing experiments. In vitro hypoxic conditions induce a significant TfR2 up-regulation, suggesting a role in tumor angiogenesis. As assessed by immunohistochemistry, the level of TfR2 expression in astrocytic tumors is related to histologic grade, with the highest expression observed in glioblastomas. The level of TfR2 expression represents a favorable prognostic factor, which is associated with the higher sensitivity to temozolomide of TfR2-positive tumor cells in vitro. The endothelial cells of glioblastoma vasculature also stain for TfR2, whereas those of the normal brain vessels do not. Importantly, TfR2 is expressed by the subpopulation of glioblastoma cells with properties of cancer-initiating cells. TfR2-positive glioblastoma cells retain their TfR2 expression on xenografting in immunodeficient mice. In conclusion, our observations demonstrate that TfR2 is a neoantigen for astrocytomas that seems attractive for developing target therapies.",

BALB/c mice bearing intradermal EMT6 tumors were given 0.3 mg/kg Pc 4 injected IT or IV through the tail vein. Photosensitizer concentration was evaluated by chloroform extraction and localization assessed by fluorescence imaging and spectroscopy in vivo. Tumors were irradiated at 667 nm, 50 mW/cm2, and 100 J/cm2. Cures were defined as no palpable tumor 90 days after irradiation. Tumor Pc 4 concentrations 1 hour after IT administration were 35,000-fold higher than measured 24 hours after IV administration (0.112 vs 0.317 x 10-5\u00b5g Pc 4/mg tumor). Exquisite tumor selectivity was observed 1 hour after IT injection. Fluorescence imaging of freshly sectioned tumors revealed no regions devoid of sensitizer at this time point, with pixel intensities in a midline section within a factor of 3 of the peak intensity. For identical photosensitizer doses, IT administration significantly improved tumor responses to irradiation, with more than 70% of tumors cured with IT-Pc 4-PDT. In this model, IT-Pc 4 administration provides improved tumor control, greater selectivity, and opportunity for a short drug-light interval.",

     "abstract": "In carcinogenesis, determination of gene and protein expression profiles is important for prevention and treatment. Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) in a single dose administered before carcinogenic initiation induced by diethylnitrosamine (DEN) prevents the appearance of preneoplastic lesions. On the basis of this approach, the main purpose of this work was to compare the gene expression profiles induced by DEN or a previously administered single dose of CAPE. Using a modified hepatocarcinogenesis-resistant hepatocyte model, male Fischer-344 rats were administered with one intraperitoneal dose of CAPE (20 mg/kg) 12 hours before DEN administration (200 mg/kg). Livers were removed and processed for microarray analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction 12 hours after CAPE dosing and 24 hours after DEN administration with or without CAPE. CAPE alone did not alter the expression profile. DEN treatment modified the expression of 665 genes, and CAPE plus DEN induced changes in 1371 genes. DEN treatment increased the expression of genes associated with oxidative stress such as glutathione reductase, genes involved in cell cycle regulation including p53, and modified cytochrome P450. CAPE plus DEN diminished the expression of cytochrome involved in DEN bioactivation such as CYP2B1 as well as the expression of regulators of oxidative stress such as glutathione reductase, GST-\u03ba and GST-\u03b8, and cell cycle regulators such as p53. Using CAPE as a tool, we uncovered new approaches for studying the altered expression of reactive genes and identifying proteins that will help to propose well-sustained and concrete hypothesis of DEN mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis initiation.",

     "abstract": "Carcinogenesis is a multistage process, involving oncogene activation and tumor suppressor gene inactivation as well as complex interactions between tumor and host tissues, leading ultimately to an aggressive metastatic phenotype. Among many genetic lesions, mutational inactivation of p53 tumor suppressor, the \u201cguardian of the genome,\u201d is the most frequent event found in 50% of human cancers. p53 plays a critical role in tumor suppression mainly by inducing growth arrest, apoptosis, and senescence, as well as by blocking angiogenesis. In addition, p53 generally confers the cancer cell sensitivity to chemoradiation. Thus, p53 becomes the most appealing target for mechanism-driven anticancer drug discovery. This review will focus on the approaches currently undertaken to target p53 and its regulators with an overall goal either to activate p53 in cancer cells for killing or to inactivate p53 temporarily in normal cells for chemoradiation protection. The compounds that activate wild type (wt) p53 would have an application for the treatment of wt p53-containing human cancer. Likewise, the compounds that change p53 conformation from mutant to wt p53 (p53 reactivation) or that kill the cancer cells with mutant p53 using a synthetic lethal mechanism can be used to selectively treat human cancer harboring a mutant p53. The inhibitors of wt p53 can be used on a temporary basis to reduce the normal cell toxicity derived from p53 activation. Thus, successful development of these three classes of p53 modulators, to be used alone or in combination with chemoradiation, will revolutionize current anticancer therapies and benefit cancer patients.",

     "doi": "https://doi.org/10.1593/tlo.09280",
     "publication date": "02-2010",
     "abstract": "Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) can be controlled for years with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib but because imatinib poorly penetrates the blood-brain barrier (BBB), on occasion, the CML clone will thrive and evolve to an accelerated phase in the resulting imatinib sanctuary within the central nervous system. In this, CML resembles glioblastoma in that imatinib, which otherwise may be effective, cannot get to the tumor. Although a common street drug of abuse, methamphetamine is Food and Drug Administration-approved and marketed as a pharmaceutical drug to treat attention-deficit disorders. It has shown the ability to open the BBB in rodents. We have some clinical hints that it may do so in humans as well. This short note presents three new points potentially leading to better tyrosine kinase inhibition behind the BBB: 1) Pharmaceutical methamphetamine may have a useful role in treating both CML and glioblastoma by allowing higher imatinib concentrations behind the BBB. 2) The old antidepressant and monoamine oxidase inhibitor selegiline, used to treat Parkinson disease, is catabolized to methamphetamine. Selegiline, as a nonscheduled drug,may therefore be an easier way to open the BBB, allowing more effective chemotherapy with tyrosine kinases. 3) Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with a spectrum of inhibition only partially overlapping that of imatinib and a mechanism of tyrosine kinase inhibition that is different from that of imatinib. The two should be additive. In addition, dasatinib crosses the BBB poorly, and it can therefore be expected to benefit from methamphetamine-assisted entry.",

The handheld optical devices developed to date using the NIR technology are predominantly developed for spectroscopic applications. A novel handheld probe-based optical imaging device has been recently developed toward area imaging and tomography applications. The three-dimensional (3D) tomographic imaging capabilities of the device have been demonstrated from previous fluorescence studies on tissue phantoms. In the current work, fluorescence imaging studies are performed on tissue phantoms, in vitro, and in vivo tissue models to demonstrate the fast two-dimensional (2D) surface imaging capabilities of this flexible handheld-based optical imaging device, toward clinical breast imaging studies. Preliminary experiments were performed using target(s) of varying volume (0.23 and 0.45 cm3) and depth (1\u20132 cm), using indocyanine green as the fluorescence contrast agent in liquid phantom, in vitro, and in vivo tissue models. The feasibility of fast 2D surface imaging (\u223c5 seconds) over large surface areas of 36 cm2 was demonstrated from various tissue models. The surface images could differentiate the target(s) from the background, allowing a rough estimate of the target's location before extensive 3D tomographic analysis (future studies).",

Using 102 tumor samples representing a large spectrum of these tumors, we performed expression profiling and defined differentially expression genes that are likely to be involved in tumors that are locally aggressive and in tumors with metastatic potential. We described a set of 12 genes (SNRPD3, MEGF9, SPTAN-1, AFAP1L2, ENDOD1, SERPIN5, ZWINTAS, TOP2A, UBE2C, ABCF1, MCM2, and ARL6IP5) showing opposite expression when these two conditions were compared. These genes are mainly related to cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions and cell proliferation and might represent helpful tools for a more precise classification and diagnosis as well as potential drug targets.",

     "abstract": "Barrett esophagus is an epithelial metaplasia that predisposes to adenocarcinoma. Better markers of cancer risk are urgently needed to identify those patients who are likely to benefit most from emerging methods of endoscopic ablation. Disease progression is associated with genomic DNA changes (segmental gains, losses, or loss of heterozygosity). Although these changes are not easily assayed directly, we hypothesized that the underlying DNA damage should activate a DNA damage response (DDR), detectable by immunohistochemical (IHC) assays of checkpoint proteins and the resulting replicative phase cell cycle delays. Surgical specimens and endoscopic biopsies (N = 28) were subjected to IHC for the cell cycle markers cyclin A and phosphorylated histone H3 (P-H3), the DDR markers \u03b3H2AX and phosphorylated ATM/ATR substrates (P-ATM/ATRsub), and the DNA damage-responsive tumor suppressors p16 and p53. Correlations were made with histologic diagnoses. The fractions of cells that stained for cyclin A, P-H3, and \u03b3H2AX increased in parallel in dysplastic tissue, consistent with checkpoint-mediated cell cycle delays. Foci of nuclear \u03b3H2AX and P-ATM/ATRsub were demonstrated by standard and confocal immunofluorescence. Staining for p16 was more prevalent in early-stage disease with lower staining for \u03b3H2AX and P-H3. Staining for p53 was moderately increased in some early-stage disease and strongly increased in some advanced disease, consistent with checkpoint-mediated induction and mutational inactivation of p53, respectively. We suggest that IHC for DDR-associated markers may help stratify risk of disease progression in Barrett.",

Inhibition of TXSA induced a proapoptotic disposition of glioma cells and increased the sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, significantly prolonging the survival time of intracerebral glioma-bearing mice.

In this article, we test the antitumor efficacy of NPI-0052 against glioma, as a single agent and in combination with temozolomide and radiation using five different glioma lines. The intrinsic radiation sensitivities differed for all the lines and correlated with their PTEN expression status. In vitro, NPI-0052 showed a dose-dependent toxicity, and its combination with temozolomide resulted in radiosensitization of only the cell lines with a mutated p53. The effect of NPI-0052 as a single agent on glioma xenografts in vivo was only modest in controlling tumor growth, and it failed to radiosensitize the glioma xenografts to fractionated radiation. We conclude that NPI-0052 is not a suitable drug for the treatment of malignant gliomas despite its efficacy in other cancer types.",

     "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors (VEGFRs) drive angiogenesis, and several VEGFR inhibitors are already approved for use as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy. Although there is a clear benefit with these drugs in a variety of tumors, the clinical response varies markedly among individuals. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient method to identify patients who are likely to respond to antiangiogenic therapy and to monitor its effects over time. We have recently developed a molecular imaging tracer for imaging VEGFRs known as scVEGF/99mTc; an engineered single-chain (sc) form of VEGF radiolabeled with technetium Tc 99m (99mTc). After intravenous injection, scVEGF/99mTc preferentially binds to and is internalized by VEGFRs expressed within tumor vasculature, providing information on prevalence of functionally active receptors. We now report that VEGFR imaging readily detects the effects of pazopanib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor under clinical development, which selectively targets VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-Kit in mice with HT29 tumor xenografts. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that the changes in VEGFR imaging reflect a dramatic pazopanib-induced decrease in the number of VEGFR-2+/CD31+ endothelial cells (ECs) within the tumor vasculature followed by a relative increase in the number of ECs at the tumor edges. We suggest that VEGFR imaging can be used for the identification of patients that are responding to VEGFR-targeted therapies and for guidance in rational design, dosing, and schedules for combination regimens of antiangiogenic treatment.",
