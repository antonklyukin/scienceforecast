     "abstract": "Initially understood for its physiological maintenance of self-tolerance, the immune checkpoint molecule has recently been recognized as a promising anti-cancer target. There has been considerable interest in the biology and the action mechanism of the immune checkpoint therapy, and their incorporation with other therapeutic regimens. Recently the small-molecule inhibitor (SMI) has been identified as an attractive combination partner for immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and is becoming a novel direction for the field of combination drug design. In this review, we provide a systematic discussion of the biology and function of major immune checkpoint molecules, and their interactions with corresponding targeting agents. With both preclinical studies and clinical trials, we especially highlight the ICI\u202f+\u202fSMI combination, with its recent advances as well as its application challenges.",

     "publication date": "04-2019",
     "abstract": "It is becoming generally accepted in recent literature that the Warburg effect in cancer depends on inhibition of M2PYK, the pyruvate kinase isozyme most commonly expressed in tumors. We remain skeptical. There continues to be a general lack of solid experimental evidence for the underlying idea that a bottle neck in aerobic glycolysis at the level of M2PYK results in an expanded pool of glycolytic intermediates (which are thought to serve as building blocks necessary for proliferation and growth of cancer cells). If a bottle neck at M2PYK exists, then the remarkable increase in lactate production by cancer cells is a paradox, particularly since a high percentage of the carbons of lactate originate from glucose. The finding that pyruvate kinase activity is invariantly increased rather than decreased in cancer undermines the logic of the M2PYK bottle neck, but is consistent with high lactate production. The \u201cinactive\u201d state of M2PYK in cancer is often described as a dimer (with reduced substrate affinity) that has dissociated from an active tetramer of M2PYK. Although M2PYK clearly dissociates easier than other isozymes of pyruvate kinase, it is not clear that dissociation of the tetramer occurs in vivo when ligands are present that promote tetramer formation. Furthermore, it is also not clear whether the dissociated dimer retains any activity at all. A number of non-canonical functions for M2PYK have been proposed, all of which can be challenged by the finding that not all cancer cell types are dependent on M2PYK expression. Additional in-depth studies of the Warburg effect and specifically of the possible regulatory role of M2PYK in the Warburg effect are needed.",

Therefore, HSP90 represents an attractive therapeutic target for many cancers, including colorectal cancer. Although monotherapy has limited clinical efficacy, preclinical and early-phase clinical studies indicate improved antitumor activity when HSP90 inhibitors are combined with chemotherapies or targeted agents. This may be further improved with a biomarker-guided approach based on oncogenic HSP90 clients, or stratification based on the consensus molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer, suggesting a synergistic activity with 5-fluorouracil in preclinical models of the chemorefractory mesenchymal subtype. Furthermore, HSP90 inhibition may activate mechanisms to turn non-immunogenic tumors hot and improve their recognition by the immune system, suggesting synergy with immune checkpoint blockade.",

Other crucial requirements on amino acids pool come from the serine, one\u2011carbon cycle, glycine synthesis pathway and folate metabolism forming major sources of interproducts for synthesis of nucleobases necessary for rapidly proliferating cells. Considering the lack of some amino acids biosynthetic pathways and/or their extraordinary importance for prostate cancer cells, there is a widespread potential for targeted therapeutic applications with no effect on non-malignant cells.

     "abstract": "While cancer is commonly described as \u201ca disease of the genes\u201d, it is also a disease of metabolism. Indeed, carcinogenesis and malignancy are highly associated with metabolic re-programming, and there is clinical evidence that interrupting a cancer's metabolic program can improve patients' outcomes. Notably, many of the metabolic adaptations observed in cancer are similar to the same perturbations observed in diabetic patients. For example, metformin is commonly used to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic patients, and has been demonstrated to reduce cancer incidence. Treatment with PI3K inhibitors can induce hyperinsulinemia, which can blunt therapeutic efficacy if unchecked. While commonalities between metabolism in cancer and diabetes have been extensively reviewed, here we examine a less explored and emergent convergence between diabetic and cancer metabolism: the generation of lactic acid and subsequent acidification of the surrounding microenvironment. Extracellular lactic acidosis is integral in disease manifestation and is a negative prognostic in both disease states. In tumors, this results in important sequela for cancer progression including increased invasion and metastasis, as well as inhibition of immune surveillance. In diabetes, acidosis impacts the ability of insulin to bind to its receptor, leading to peripheral resistance and an exacerbation of symptoms. Thus, acidosis may be a relevant therapeutic target, and we describe three approaches for targeting: buffers, nanomedicine, and proton pump inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Due to its complexity in nature, effective BC treatment can encounter many challenges. The human RALBP1 gene encodes a 76-kDa splice variant protein, RLIP (ral-binding protein1, RalBP1), a stress-protective mercapturic acid pathway (MAP) transporter protein, that also plays a key role in regulating clathrin-dependent endocytosis (CDE) as a Ral effector. Growing evidence shows that targeting RLIP may be an effective strategy in cancer therapy, as RLIP is over-expressed in multiple cancers and is known to induce resistance to apoptosis and chemotherapeutic drugs. Recent studies demonstrated that RLIP is expressed in human BC tissues, as well as BC cell lines. Knockdown of RLIP resulted in apoptotic death of BC cells in vitro, and targeted inhibition and depletion of RLIP resulted in regression of BC in xenograft studies of nude mice. Signaling studies showed that RLIP depletion inhibited endocytosis and differentially regulated signaling to Akt, Myc, and ERK1/2. However, the proliferation and multi-specific transport mechanisms that promote RLIP-mediated cell death in BC are not well understood. In this review, we will discuss a missing but an essentially determining and connecting piece of the puzzle on the understanding of proliferation and transport mechanisms by focused analyses of the apoptotic, drug- and radiation-sensitivity regulated by RLIP, a stress-responsive non-ATP-binding cassette (ABC), high capacity MAP transporter, in breast cancer.",

Activation of the CXCLs/CXCR2 axis activates multiple signalling pathways, including the PI3K, p38/ERK, and JAK pathways, and regulates cell survival and migration. The CXCLs/CXCR2 axis plays a vital role in the tumour microenvironment and in recruiting neutrophils to inflammatory sites. Extensive infiltration of neutrophils during chronic inflammation is one of the most important pathogenic factors in various inflammatory diseases. Chronic inflammation is considered to be closely correlated with initiation of cancer. In addition, immunosuppressive effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) against T cells attenuate the anti-tumour effects of T cells and promote tumour invasion and metastasis. Over the last several decades, many therapeutic strategies targeting CXCR2 have shown promising results and entered clinical trials.

Despite recent studies reporting AFM imaging for the analyses of biomolecules, the application of AFM-based cancer-specific biomolecule/cell detection has remained largely underexplored, especially for the early diagnosis of cancer. In this paper, we review the recent attempts, including our efforts, to analyze and detect cancer-specific biomolecules and cancer cells. We particularly focus on two AFM-based cancer diagnosis techniques: (i) AFM imaging-based biomolecular and cellular detection, (ii) AFM cantilever-based biomolecular sensing and cell analysis. It is shown that AFM-based biomolecular detection has been applied for not only early diagnosing cancer, by measuring the minute amount of cancer-specific proteins, but also monitoring of cancer progression, by correlating the amount of cancer-specific proteins with the progression of cancer. In addition, AFM-based cell imaging and detection have been employed for diagnosing cancer, by detecting cancerous cells in tissue, as well as understanding cancer progression, by characterizing the dynamics of cancer cells. This review, therefore, highlights AFM-based biomolecule/cell detection, which will pave the way for developing a fast and point-of-care diagnostic system for biomedical applications.",

Tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) are notoriously known for orchestrating the invasion-metastasis cascade via systemic pathways that we have previously proposed (1), resulting in a paradigm shift of our understanding about the pathobiology of metastases. In principle, exosomes serve as transport medium for proteins, mRNAs and miRNAs to transmit targeted cues from the primary cell to distant sites via horizontal transfer or cell-receptor interaction. In this chapter, we seek to explore in-depth the mechanisms engendering TDE in the metastatic cascade, along with experimental models to augment our understanding. The aforementioned has also paved way for parallel advancements in the therapeutic armamentarium, as evident from pronounced efforts to exploit the metastatic process for therapeutic targeting. In this light, we aim to examine potential anti-metastatic therapeutic opportunities derived from exosomal research. Lastly, exosomes may play a crucial role in the contemporary era of \u201cliquid biopsies\u201d, given the array of molecular information with diagnostic and predictive indications. We thus intend to end this chapter off by exploring future applications of exosomes that could illuminate shortcomings and propel advancements in biomarker research.",

     "abstract": "Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a reversible developmental genetic programme of transdifferentiation of polarised epithelial cells to mesenchymal cells. In cancer, EMT is an important factor of tumour cell plasticity and has received increasing attention for its role in the resistance to conventional and targeted therapies. In this paper we provide an overview of EMT in human malignancies, and discuss contribution of EMT to the development of the resistance to Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with the tumours bearing specific mutations in EGFR have a good clinical response to selective EGFR inhibitors, but the resistance inevitably develops. Several mechanisms responsible for the resistance include secondary mutations in the EGFR gene, genetic or non-mutational activation of alternative survival pathways, transdifferentiation of NSCLC to the small cell lung cancer histotype, or formation of resistant tumours with mesenchymal characteristics. Mechanistically, application of an EGFR inhibitor does not kill all cancer cells; some cells survive the exposure to a drug, and undergo genetic evolution towards resistance. Here, we present a theory that these quiescent or slow-proliferating drug-tolerant cell populations, or so-called \u201cpersisters\u201d, are generated via EMT pathways. We review the EMT-activated mechanisms of cell survival in NSCLC, which include activation of ABC transporters and EMT-associated receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, immune evasion, and epigenetic reprogramming. We propose that therapeutic inhibition of these pathways would eliminate pools of persister cells and prevent or delay cancer recurrence when applied in combination with the agents targeting EGFR.",

Recent studies show that the alterations of NIK or the components of its regulatory complex are manifold including regulation on the transcript level, copy number changes, mutations as well as protein modifications. High NIK activity is associated with different human malignancies and has adverse effects on tumor patient survival.

However, a lack of clear understanding about the origin, existence, maintenance, and metastatic roles of CSCs limit efforts towards the development of CSC-targeted therapy. In this review, we describe novel avenues of current CSC biology. In addition to cell fusion and horizontal gene transfer, CSCs are originated by mutations in somatic or differentiated cancer cells, resulting in de-differentiation and reprogramming. Recent studies also provided evidence for the existence of distinct or heterogeneous CSC populations within a single heterogeneous tumor. Our analysis of the literature also opens the doors for a novel hypothesis that CSC populations with specific phenotypes, metabolic profiles, and clonogenic potential metastasize to specific organs.",

While Kaiso's biological role in normal tissues has yet to be fully elucidated, Kaiso has been increasingly implicated in multiple human cancers including colon, prostate, ovarian, lung, breast and chronic myeloid leukemia. In the majority of human cancers investigated to date, high Kaiso expression correlates with aggressive tumor characteristics including proliferation and metastasis, and/or poor prognosis. More recently, interest in Kaiso stems from its apparent correlation with racial disparities in breast and prostate cancer incidence and survival outcomes in people of African Ancestry.

     "abstract": "In the last decade, it has become clear that anti-cancer therapy is more successful when it can also induce an immunogenic form of cancer cell death (ICD). ICD is an umbrella term covering several cell death modalities, including apoptosis and necroptosis. In general, ICD is characterized by the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and/or cytokines/chemokines, leading to the induction of strong anti-tumor immune responses. In experimental cancer therapy, new observations indicate that the immunogenicity of dying cancer cells can be improved by the use of biomaterials. In this review, after a brief overview of the basic principles of the concept of ICD and discussion of the potential use of DAMPs as biomarkers of therapy efficacy, we discuss an emerging role of nanomaterials as a promising strategy to modulate the immunogenicity of cancer cell death. We address how nanocarriers can be used to increase the immunogenicity of ICD and then turn our attention to their dual action. Nanocarriers can be used to increase the immunogenicity of dying cancer cells and to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy. Future studies will show whether biomaterials are truly an optimal strategy to modulate the immunogenicity of dying cancer cells and will provide the insights needed for the development of novel treatment strategies for cancer.",

In the recent years, using extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from blood as biomarkers has gained widespread popularity, mainly because they are thought to be easy to isolate and carry a vast variety of biological cargos that can be analyzed for biomarker purposes. However, our current knowledge on the plasma EV concentration in normophysiological states is sparse. Here, we provide the very first mean estimate of the plasma EV concentration based on values obtained from a thorough literature review. The different estimates obtained from the literature are correlated to the isolation techniques used to obtain them, illustrating how some methodologies may over- or underestimate the plasma EV concentration. We also show that the estimated plasma EV concentration (approximately 1010 EVs per mL) defines EVs as a minority population compared to other colloidal particles of the systemic circulation, namely the lipoproteins, which are known contaminants in EV isolates and carry biomarker molecules themselves. Lastly, we introduce the possibility of regarding EVs and lipoproteins as a continuum of lipid-containing particles to which biomarker molecules can be associated. Using such a holistic approach, increased strength of plasma-derived cancer biomarkers may soon be revealed.",

To this end, PROTACs have been developed as a group of engineered bi-functional chemical glues that induce the ubiquitination-mediated degradation of substrates via recruiting E3 ligases, such as CRL4 (CRBN) and CRL2 (pVHL). We summarize the recent major advances in the CRL4 research field towards understanding its involvement in tumorigenesis and further discuss its clinical implications. The anti-tumor effects using the PROTAC approach to target the degradation of undruggable targets are also highlighted.",

     "abstract": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a very recently discovered class of small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), with approximately 20,000 piRNA genes already identified within the human genome. These short RNAs were originally described as key functional regulators for the germline maintenance and transposon silencing. However, due to our limited knowledge regarding their function, piRNAs were for a long time assumed to be the \u201cdark matter\u201d of ncRNAs in our genome. However, recent evidence has now changed our viewpoint of their biological and clinical significance in various diseases, as newly emerging data reveals that aberrant expression of piRNAs is a unique and distinct feature in many diseases, including multiple human cancers. Furthermore, their altered expression in cancer patients has been significantly associated with clinical outcomes, highlighting their important biological functional role in disease progression. Functionally, piRNAs maintain genomic integrity by silencing transposable elements, and are capable of regulating the expression of specific downstream target genes in a post-transcriptional manner. Moreover, accumulating evidences demonstrates that analogous to other small ncRNAs (e.g. miRNAs) piRNAs have both oncogenic and tumor suppressive roles in cancer development. In this article, we discuss emerging insights into roles of piRNAs in a variety of cancers, reveal new findings underpinning various mechanisms of piRNAs-mediated gene regulation, and highlight their potential clinical significance in the management of cancer patients.",

FOXP3 was initially discovered in regulatory T cells and supposed to play a significant role in the process of regulatory T cell differentiation. Increasing evidence has shown that FOXP3 is also expressed in tumor cells. However, the results of tumor FOXP3 is inconsistent and even the opposite. In some types of human cancers, the expression of FOXP3 is upregulated, and it can promote the development of cancers, leading to a poor prognosis. While in some other types of cancers, it is a different story. The reason for the contradictory data is unknown. The discovery of FOXP3 isoforms, interaction between tumor cells and lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment, subcellular location, and mutation of FOXP3 may provide some clues. In this review, we first summarize and analyze the recent development. The final section focuses on the regulation of FOXP3 expression.",

     "abstract": "The transition from mitosis to interphase, referred to as mitotic exit, is a critical mitotic process which involves activation and inactivation of multiple mitotic kinases and counteracting protein phosphatases. Loss of mitotic exit checkpoints is a common feature of cancer cells, leading to mitotic dysregulation and confers cancer cells with oncogenic characteristics, such as aberrant proliferation and microtubule-targeting agent (MTA) resistance. Since MTA resistance results from cancer cells prematurely exiting mitosis (mitotic slippage), blocking mitotic exit is believed to be a promising anticancer strategy. Moreover, based on this theory, simultaneous inhibition of mitotic exit and additional cell cycle phases would likely achieve synergistic antitumor effects. In this review, we divide the molecular regulators of mitotic exit into four categories based on their different regulatory functions: 1) the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C, a ubiquitin ligase), 2) cyclin B, 3) mitotic kinases and phosphatases, 4) kinesins and microtubule-binding proteins. We also review the regulators of mitotic exit and propose prospective anticancer strategies targeting mitotic exit, including their strengths and possible challenges to their use.",

Research to date strongly supports EVs as playing a key role in drug-resistance. Further studies including tailored clinical studies are now warranted to determine how best to prevent this occurring, in the interest of patients and also for economic benefit.

It is characterized by, often severe, loss of muscle, with or without loss of fat mass. Insight in the pathophysiology of this complex metabolic syndrome and direct treatment options are still limited, which creates a research demand. Results from recent studies point towards a significant involvement of muscle mitochondrial networks. However, data are scattered and a comprehensive overview is lacking. This paper aims to fill existing knowledge gaps by integrating published data sets on muscle protein or gene expression from cancer-induced cachexia animal models. To this end, a database was compiled from 94 research papers, comprising 11 different rodent models. This was combined with four genome-wide transcriptome datasets of cancer-induced cachexia rodent models. Analysis showed that the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial fusion, fission, ATP production and mitochondrial density is decreased, while that of genes involved ROS detoxification and mitophagy is increased. Our results underline the relevance of including post-translational modifications of key proteins involved in mitochondrial functioning in future studies on cancer-induced cachexia.",

Individual CTCs \u2013 and a binary framework of EMT \u2013 have been long considered to be sufficient and necessary condition for metastasis. However, recent studies have shown that collective migration and invasion through tumor buds and clusters of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) as possibly being the prevalent mode of metastasis, although individual CTCs may still contribute to metastasis. These strands and clusters have been proposed to often exhibit a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal (E/M) phenotype where cells retain epithelial traits of cell-cell adhesion and simultaneously gain mesenchymal characteristics of migration and invasion. To highlight the crucial questions regarding metastasis, we define EMT in a non-binary and context-specific manner, suggest that it can be viewed as a trans-differentiation process, and illustrate the implications of hybrid E/M phenotype(s) and cluster-based dissemination in metastasis.",

The extracellular matrix (ECM) component of solid tumors has been implicated in metastatic progression; however, the ECM exists as a complex macromolecular substrate and it is unclear how its molecular composition promotes cancer progression. ECM homeostasis is regulated by various secreted proteins including cross-linkers (e.g., lysyl oxidases and transglutaminases), modifying enzymes (e.g., sulfatases and extracellular kinases), proteases (e.g., matrix metalloproteinases, heparanase, and cathepsins) and protease inhibitors (e.g., tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, cystatins, and serpins); each of which can alter the structural, mechanical, and biochemical properties of the ECM.

The use of circulating miRNAs for the early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is of particular interest as it can offer a potential complementary approach to screening colonoscopy. However, the development of circulating miRNAs as \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d biomarkers for development into clinical screening tests has been hampered by several issues. In this article, we summarize the status of this field for the clinical utilization of miRNA biomarkers as liquid biopsies in colorectal cancer (CRC) and discuss their applications as screening tests for patients with colorectal adenoma (CRA) and CRC. Herein, we undertook a systematic search for citations in PubMed and the Cochrane Database from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2017 as electronic sources for this study. All published studies were screened with no restriction on language, date, or country. We used database-specific combinations of the following index terms and text words, including: microRNA, colorectal cancer, serum, plasma, and exosomes. Based upon these searches, we summarize the progress and salient features of the current state of knowledge of miRNA diagnostic biomarkers in CRC, and focuses on the articles that attempt to optimize ideal methodologies to further advance their as liquid biopsies for clinical use. We conclude that the field of noncoding RNAs, particularly for the clinical use of miRNAs as liquid biopsy assays is maturing rapidly, and it is highly promising that these genomic signatures will likely be developed into clinically-viable tests for the early detection and clinical management of patients with colorectal cancer in the not so distant future.",

Identification of AR-associated signaling pathways is of great significance for in-depth understanding of their roles in pathogenesis of TNBC. To meet this objective, preclinical and clinical studies were conducted to clarify the biological interactions of AR signaling and combination strategies based on AR-targeted therapy. Biologically, AR signaling in TNBC which not only interacts with a network of key pathways, involving PI3K/AKT/mTOR, cell cycle, and DNA damage repair pathways, but mediates pivotal processes of tumor initiation and immunogenic modulation, may present an opportunity to overcome the insensitivity of single AR-targeted therapy. Research in investigating androgen-blockade based combination therapy in this aggressive tumor has demonstrated promising benefit in preclinical studies, and comparable clinical trials of combined strategies with CDK4/6 inhibitors, PI3K inhibition, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy, are ongoing. Accordingly, clinical interpretation of AR-related biological interactions, aiming at combined blockade of the signaling pathways may pave a new way for endocrine-based therapy in the treatment of TNBC.",

Because of its essential role in nutrient supplementation, the study of plasma membrane inorganic phosphate transporters in cancer biology has received much attention in recent years. Several studies suggest that these transporters are up-regulated in tumor cells and thus have been considered to be important promoters of tumor progression. Altered expression levels of inorganic phosphate transporters, such as NaPi-IIb (SLC34A2) and PiT-1 (SLC20A1), have been demonstrated. The purpose of this review article was to gather the relevant experimental records on inorganic phosphate transporters in tumors and to demonstrate the importance of these proteins in clinical applications. In this work, we demonstrate that for decades, the potential use of the inorganic phosphate transporter as an antigen for the diagnosis of tumor subtypes remained unknown. With the advancement in molecular biology techniques, phosphate transporters have been identified as being associated with cancer. In addition to their altered expression in cancer, several studies have demonstrated other functions of inorganic phosphate transporters, such as transceptors, rearrangements with oncogenes and modifications in the expression of ABC transporters, aiding in the process of proliferation and drug resistance.",

Furthermore, PDA cells display high levels of basal autophagy and macropinocytosis. KRAS is the driving oncogene in PDA and many of the metabolic changes are downstream of its activation. Together, these unique pathways for nutrient utilization and acquisition result in metabolic plasticity enabling cells to rapidly adapt to nutrient and oxygen fluctuations. This remarkable adaptability has been implicated as a cause of the intense therapeutic resistance.

While once considered a vestigial organelle, we now know that peroxisomes play a central role in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species, bile acids, ether phospholipids (e.g. plasmalogens), very-long chain, and branched-chain fatty acids. Immune system evasion is a hallmark of cancer, and peroxisomes have an emerging role in the regulation of cellular immune responses. Investigations of individual peroxisome proteins and metabolites support their pro-tumorigenic functions. However, a significant knowledge gap remains regarding how individual functions of proteins and metabolites of the peroxisome orchestrate its potential role as a pro-tumorigenic organelle. This review highlights new advances in our understanding of biogenesis, enzymatic functions, and autophagic degradation of peroxisomes (pexophagy), and provides evidence linking these activities to tumorigenesis.

During the past decade, there has been significant progress in the understanding of molecular mechanisms in DLBCL, largely owing to collaborative efforts in large-scale gene expression profiling and deep sequencing, which have identified genetic alterations critical in lymphomagenesis through activation of key signaling transduction pathways in DLBCL. These discoveries have not only led to the development of targeted therapies, including several currently in clinical trials, but also laid a solid foundation for the future identification of more effective therapies for patients not curable by R-CHOP.

     "abstract": "Cell polarity is a fundamental property used to generate asymmetry and structure in all cells. Cancer is associated with loss of cell and tissue structure. While observations made in model system such as Drosophila, identify polarity regulators as tumor suppressors that cause inappropriate cell division, studies in mammalian epithelia do not always support such a causative contribution. Our analysis of published cancer dataset shows that many polarity genes, including PARD6B, SCRIB, PRKCI, DLG1, DLG2, DLG5 and LLGL2, are frequently amplified in multiple cancers raising the possibility that mammalian epithelia may have evolved to use polarity proteins in multiple ways where they may have tumor promoting functions. In this review, we reinterpret the published results and propose a modified perspective for the role of polarity regulators in cancer biology. In addition to the traditional form of cell polarity, which is involved establishment of maintenance of normal cell structure and asymmetry, we propose that some mammalian polarity proteins also regulate subcellular polarity (intracellular asymmetry), which can improve cellular fitness to carry out functions such as proliferation, apoptosis, stress adaptation, stemness and organelle biology. Here, we define subcellular polarity and discuss evidence that supports a role for subcellular polarity in biology.",

Recently, patient-derived organoid cultures have emerged as a novel technique to fill this critical need. Organoids maintain tumor tissue heterogeneity and drug-resistance responses, and thus are useful for high-throughput drug screening. Among various biological tissues used to produce organoid cultures, circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are promising, due to relative ease of ascertainment. CTC-derived organoids could help to acquire relevant genetic and epigenetic information about tumors in real time, and screen and test promising drugs. This could reduce the need for tissue biopsies, which are painful and may be difficult depending on the tumor location.

Accumulating evidence suggests that immunosurveillance represents a critical barrier that emerging tumor cells have to overcome in order to sustain the course of tumor development. Virtually all of the agents with cancer preventive activity have been shown to have an immune modulating effect. A number of immunoprevention studies aimed at triggering antitumor immune response against early lesions have been performed, some of which have shown promising results. Furthermore, the recent success of immune checkpoint blockade therapy reinforces the notion that cancers including CRC can be effectively intervened via immune modulation including immune normalization, and has stimulated various immune-based combination prevention studies.

It is time to re-visit and comb through our cutting-edge knowledge on fusion genes to accelerate clinical translation of these internal markers.

Molecular chaperones by buffering critical elements of signaling pathways empower tumor evolution leading to chemoresistance of cancer cells. Controversially, the same molecular chaperones, which are indispensable for p53 in reaching its tumor suppressor potential, are beneficial in adopting an oncogenic gain of function phenotype when TP53 is mutated. On the molecular level, heat shock proteins by unwinding the mutant p53 protein expose aggregation-prone sites leading to the sequestration of other tumor suppressor proteins causing inhibition of apoptosis and chemoresistance. Therefore, within this review therapeutic approaches combining classical immuno- and/or chemotherapy with specific inhibition of selected molecular chaperones shall be discussed.",

     "abstract": "Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used antineoplastic agent for a wide range of cancers, including hematological malignancies, soft tissue sarcomas and solid tumors. However, DOX exhibits a dose-related toxicity that results in life-threatening cardiomyopathy. In addition to the heart, there is evidence that DOX toxicity extends to other organs. This general toxicity seems to be related to mitochondrial network structural, molecular and functional impairments. Several countermeasures for these negative effects have been proposed, being physical exercise, not only one of the most effective non-pharmacologic strategy but also widely recommended as booster against cancer-related fatigue.It is widely accepted that mitochondria are critical sensors of tissue functionality, both modulated by DOX and exercise. Therefore, this review focuses on the current understanding of the mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms underlying the protective effect of exercise against DOX-induced toxicity, not only limited to the cardiac tissue, but also in other tissues such as skeletal muscle, liver and brain. We here analyze recent developments regarding the beneficial effects of exercise targeting mitochondrial responsive phenotypes against redox changes, mitochondrial bioenergetics, apoptotic, dynamics and quality control signalling affected by DOX treatment.",

     "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cells are an important subset of lymphocytes which play a critical role in host immunity against cancers. With MHC-independent recognition, short lifespan and potent cytotoxicity, NK cells make a promising candidate for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered cancer immunotherapy. Due to innate biological properties of NK cells, CAR-NK may outperform CAR-T therapy in terms of less side effects and more universal access, which may become a great reformation in CAR-based cancer immunotherapy. The CARs used in peripheral blood (PB) NK cells as well as NK cell line like NK-92 are the most important outfits defining antigenic specificity. The constructs of CARs used in NK cells from different sources vary, which all undergo generational optimization. The anti-tumor effects of CAR-NK have been validated in numerous preclinical trials for cancers, including hematologic malignancies and many solid tumors, which provide evidence for potential clinical application of CAR-NK. Additionally, this review concludes the challenges faced in the application of CAR-NK. Although CAR-NK is considered as one of the most possible \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d products, the improvement for the efficiency of expansion and transduction as well as the solution for underlying safety issues is still needed.

Molecular information can help in classifying cancer subtypes and in providing clinicians with novel targeted therapeutic opportunities. In this regard, classification of breast cancer into intrinsic subtypes based on molecular profiling represents a valuable prototype.The High Mobility Group A (HMGA) chromatin architectural factors (HMGA1a, HMGA1b, and HMGA2) have a relevant and causal role in breast cancer onset and development, by influencing virtually all cancer hallmarks. The regulation of HMGA expression is under the control of major pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival, as well as in other cancer-related processes, thereby suggesting, for the HMGA members, a high degree of homology and overlapping activities. Despite of this evidence, HMGA proteins display also specific functions.In this review, we provide an overview of (i) the pathways involved in HMGA transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, (ii) the utilization of HMGA as molecular markers, and (iii) the biological role of HMGA in the context of breast cancer. We focus on the potential significance of HMGA in governing the onset and development of this tumour, as well as on the potential of these factors as novel specific targets for preventing and treating strategies. The emerging picture is a highly interconnected triad of proteins that could mutually influence each other, either in a competitive or cooperative manner, and that, in our opinion, should be considered as a unified and integrated protein system.",

     "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade therapy targeting CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1 is a promising strategy in the treatment of different types of cancers. However, the clinical success rates of these therapies are still moderate and varied among cancer types. Therefore, identification of alternative and novel checkpoint molecules or interrupting tolerogenic pathways is urgently needed for successful tumor immunotherapy. Immunoglobulin-like transcript 4 (ILT4) is as an immunosuppressive molecule predominantly expressed in myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and granulocytes. Recent studies revealed that ILT4 is also enriched in tumor cells and stroma cells in the tumor microenvironment of various malignancies, modulating the biological behaviors of tumor cells and promoting their immune escape. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for ILT4-mediated tumor development and progression are still poorly understood. In this review, we explore the functional role of ILT4 as a novel checkpoint molecule in cancers. We specifically discuss the mechanisms mediated by ILT4 for controlling tumor malignant behaviors, impairing effector anti-tumor immune responses, and sustaining the tumor suppressive microenvironment. We also highlight the potential role of ILT4 as a novel immune checkpoint target for tumor immunotherapy. Improved understanding of these issues is critical for elucidation of the role of ILT4 in tumor pathogenesis and should open new avenues for cancer immunotherapy specifically targeting this novel and alternative checkpoint molecule.",

Stimulation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) by dedicated ligands and consequent activation of the cAMP\u00b7PKA pathway finely couple energy production and metabolism to cell growth and survival. Compartmentalization of PKA signaling at mitochondria by A-Kinase Anchor Proteins (AKAPs) ensures efficient transduction of signals generated at the cell membrane to the organelles, controlling important aspects of mitochondrial biology. Emerging evidence implicates mitochondria as essential bioenergetic elements of cancer cells that promote and support tumor growth and metastasis. In this context, mitochondria provide the building blocks for cellular organelles, cytoskeleton and membranes, and supply all the metabolic needs for the expansion and dissemination of actively replicating cancer cells. Functional interference with mitochondrial activity deeply impacts on cancer cell survival and proliferation. Therefore, mitochondria represent valuable targets of novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of cancer patients. Understanding the biology of mitochondria, uncovering the molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial activity andmapping the relevant metabolic and signaling networks operating in cancer cells will undoubtly contribute to create a molecular platform to be used for the treatment of proliferative disorders.Here, we will highlight the emerging roles of signaling pathways acting downstream to GPCRs and their intersection with the ubiquitin proteasome system in the control of mitochondrial activity in different aspects of cancer cell biology.",

Tumor cells express more phosphate cotransporters and store more inorganic phosphate than normal cells, and dysregulated phosphate homeostasis is associated with the genesis of various human tumors. High dietary phosphate consumption causes the growth of lung and skin tumors in experimental animal models. Additional studies show that excessive phosphate burden induces growth-promoting cell signaling, stimulates neovascularization, and is associated with chromosome instability and metastasis. Studies have also shown phosphate is a mitogenic factor that affects various tumor cell growth. Among epidemiological evidence linking phosphate and tumor formation, the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study found that high dietary phosphate levels were independently associated with lethal and high-grade prostate cancer. Further research is needed to determine how excessive dietary phosphate consumption influences initiation and promotion of tumorigenesis, and to elucidate prognostic benefits of reducing phosphate burden to decrease tumor cell growth and delay metastatic progression. The results of such studies could provide the basis for therapeutic modulation of phosphate metabolism for improved patient outcome.",

Breast tumours can be detected by assessing several features in mammographic images but one of the most common are the presence of small deposits of calcium known as microcalcifications, which in many cases may be the only detectable sign of a breast tumour. In addition to their efficacy in the detection of breast cancer, the presence of microcalcifications within a breast tumour may also convey useful prognostic information. Breast tumours with associated calcifications display an increased rate of HER2 overexpression as well as decreased survival, increased risk of recurrence, high tumour grade and increased likelihood of spread to the lymph nodes. Clearly, the presence of microcalcifications in a tumour is a clinically significant finding, suggesting that a detailed understanding of their formation may improve our knowledge of the early stages of breast tumourigenesis, yet there are no reports which attempt to bring together recent basic science research findings and current knowledge of the clinical significance of microcalcifications.

Expression of some RGD cadherins is associated with aggressive forms of cancer during the late stages of metastasis, and CDH17 and VE-cadherin have emerged as critical actors in cancer metastasis. After binding to \u03b12\u03b21 integrin, these cadherins promote integrin \u03b21 activation, and thereby cell adhesion, invasion and proliferation, in liver and lung metastasis. Activation of \u03b12\u03b21 integrin provokes an affinity increase for type IV collagen, a major component of the basement membrane and a critical partner for cell anchoring in liver and other metastatic organs. Activation of \u03b12\u03b21 integrin by RGD motifs breaks an old paradigm of integrin classification and supports an important role of this integrin in cancer metastasis. Recently, synthetic peptides containing the RGD motif of CDH17 elicited highly specific and selective antibodies that block the ability of CDH17 RGD to activate \u03b12\u03b21 integrin. These monoclonal antibodies inhibit metastatic colonization in orthotopic mouse models of liver and lung metastasis for colorectal cancer and melanoma, respectively. Hopefully, blocking the cadherin RGD ligand capacity will give us control over the integrin activity in solid tumors metastasis, paving the way for development of new agents of cancer treatment.",

Nearly 20% of all cancers are attributable to pathogenic organisms. Pathogenic infections result in deregulation of gene expression both by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, thereby causing malignant transformation. Another characteristic of pathogen-induced cancers is the occurrence of chronic inflammation due to activation of the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. This review focuses on the epigenetic changes induced by oncoviruses, parasites, cancer-causing bacteria and \u2018endogenous pathogens\u2019 to trigger host cell proliferation indefinitely as well as the inflammation associated with pathogen-induced cancers. The opportunity of targeting components of both pathogen and host epigenetic machinery to limit tumor progression is also discussed.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most lethal primary brain tumor and poor survival of glioblastoma patients is attributed to the presence of glioma stem cells (GSCs). These therapy-resistant, quiescent and pluripotent cells reside in GSC niches, which are specific microenvironments that protect GSCs against radiotherapy and chemotherapy. We previously showed the existence of hypoxic peri-arteriolar GSC niches in glioblastoma tumor samples. However, other studies have described peri-vascular niches, peri-hypoxic niches, peri-immune niches and extracellular matrix niches of GSCs. The aim of this review was to critically evaluate the literature on these five different types of GSC niches. In the present review, we describe that the five niche types are not distinct from one another, but should be considered to be parts of one integral GSC niche model, the hypoxic peri-arteriolar GSC niche. Moreover, hypoxic peri-arteriolar GSC niches are structural and functional look-alikes of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches in the bone marrow. GSCs are maintained in peri-arteriolar niches by the same receptor-ligand interactions as HSCs in bone marrow. Our concept should be rigidly tested in the near future and applied to develop therapies to expel and keep GSCs out of their protective niches to render them more vulnerable to standard therapies.",

     "abstract": "The focus of basic and applied research on core stem cell transcription factors has paved the way to initial delineation of their characteristics, their regulatory mechanisms, and the applicability of their regulatory proteins for protein-induced pluripotent stem cells (protein-IPSC) generation and in further clinical settings. Striking parallels have been observed between cancer stem cells (CSCs) and stem cells. For the maintenance of stem cells and CSC pluripotency and differentiation, post translational modifications (i.e., ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation) are tightly regulated, as these modifications result in a variety of stem cell fates. The identification of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) involved in the regulation of core stem cell transcription factors and CSC-related proteins might contribute to providing novel insights into the implications of DUB regulatory mechanisms for governing cellular reprogramming and carcinogenesis. Moreover, we propose the novel possibility of applying DUBs coupled with core transcription factors to improve protein-iPSC generation efficiency. Additionally, this review article further illustrates the potential of applying DUB inhibitors as a novel therapeutic intervention for targeting CSCs. Thus, defining DUBs as core pharmacological targets implies that future endeavors to develop their inhibitors may revolutionize our ability to regulate stem cell maintenance and differentiation, somatic cell reprogramming, and cancer stem cells.",

     "abstract": "Cullin 3-RING ligases (CRL3) play pivotal roles in the regulation of various physiological and pathological processes, including neoplastic events. The substrate adaptors of CRL3 typically contain a BTB domain that mediates the interaction between Cullin 3 and target substrates to promote their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. The biological implications of CRL3 adaptor proteins have been well described where they have been found to play a role as either an oncogene, tumor suppressor, or can mediate either of these effects in a context-dependent manner. Among the extensively studied CRL3-based E3 ligases, the role of the adaptor protein SPOP (speckle type BTB/POZ protein) in tumorigenesis appears to be tissue or cellular context dependent. Specifically, SPOP acts as a tumor suppressor via destabilizing downstream oncoproteins in many malignancies, especially in prostate cancer. However, SPOP has largely an oncogenic role in kidney cancer. Keap1, another well-characterized CRL3 adaptor protein, likely serves as a tumor suppressor within diverse malignancies, mainly due to its specific turnover of its downstream oncogenic substrate, NRF2 (nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2). In accordance with the physiological role the various CRL3 adaptors exhibit, several pharmacological agents have been developed to disrupt its E3 ligase activity, therefore blocking its potential oncogenic activity to mitigate tumorigenesis.",

Infection with c may cause chronic gastritis which via a quite well described process known as Correas cascade can progress through sequential development of atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia to gastric cancer. H. pylori is currently the only bacterium that is classified as a class 1 carcinogen by the WHO, although the exact mechanisms by which this bacterium contributes to gastric carcinogenesis are still poorly understood. Only a minority of H. pylori-infected patients will eventually develop gastric cancer, suggesting that host factors may be important in determining the outcome of H. pylori infection. This is supported by a growing body of evidence suggesting that the host genetic background contributes to risk of H. pylori infection and gastric carcinogenesis. In particular single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes that influence bacterial handling via pattern recognition receptors appear to be involved, further strengthening the link between host risk factors, H. pylori incidence and cancer. Many of these genes influence cellular pathways leading to inflammatory signaling, inflammasome formation and autophagy. In this review we summarize known carcinogenic effects of H. pylori, and discuss recent findings that implicate host genetic pattern recognition pathways in the development of gastric cancer and their relation with H. pylori.",

This has led to the emergence of EVs as a key player in tumor growth and metastasis through the formation of \u201ctumor niches\u201d in target organs. Recent data have also been shown that EVs may transform the microenvironment of primary tumors thus favoring the selection of cancer cells with a metastatic behavior.

However, cancer EVs may induce malignant transformation in resident mesenchymal stem cells, suggesting that the metastatic process is not exclusively due to circulating tumor cells.

Immunocheckpoint inhibitors, such as anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-PD-ligand(L)1 agents, are in course of investigation in TNBC, used alone or in combination with other systemic or local approaches. However, the high cost of these drugs and the lack of validated predictive biomarkers support the development of strategies aimed to overcome resistance and optimize the efficacy of these approaches.Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAMs) derive from peripheral blood monocytes recruited into the TNBC microenvironment and, in response to several stimuli, undergo M1 (classical) or M2 (alternative) activation. In TNBC, TAMs promote tumor growth and progression by several mechanisms that include the secretion of inhibitory cytokines, the reduction of effector functions of Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) and the promotion of Regulatory T cell (Treg). Interestingly, TAMs have been shown to directly and indirectly modulate PD-1/PD-L1 expression in tumor environment. On this scenario, several TAM-centered strategies have been proposed, such as the suppression of TAM recruitment, the depletion of their number, the switch of M2 TAMs into antitumor M1 phenotype and the inhibition of TAM-associated molecules. In this review, we will illustrate the activity of TAMs and associated molecules in TNBC, focusing on their role in modulating the expression of PD-1/PD-L1 and on the emerging TAM-tailored strategies for TNBC patients.",

Different from the dysregulated growth control and ample genetic mutations associated with human cancers, AD displays damage and death of brain neurons in the absence of genomic alterations.

Hence, we performed a thorough review by summarizing the physiological roles of these key cancer-related signaling pathways in AD pathogenesis, comprising of the crosstalk of these pathways with neurofibrillary tangle and senile plaque formation to impact AD phenotypes.

They are small vesicles with phospholipid membrane carrying proteins, DNA and different classes of RNAs and are heavily involved in intercellular communication acting as vectors of information to target cells. For the last decade, the interest in EV research has exponentially increased though thorough studies of their roles in various pathologies that was not previously possible due to technical limitations. This review focuses on research evaluating the role of EV production in gastrointestinal (GI) cancer development in conjunction with GI microbiota and inflammatory diseases. We also discuss recent studies on the promising role of EVs and their content as biomarkers for early diagnosis of GI cancers.The bMVs have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of GI chronic inflammatory diseases, however, possible role of bMVs in tumorigenesis remains underestimated. We propose that EVs from eukaryotic cells as well as from different microbial, fungi, parasitic species and edible plants in GI tract act as mediators of intracellular and inter-species communication, particularly facilitating tumor cell survival and multi-drug resistance.In conclusion, we suggest that matching sequences from EV proteomes (available from public databases) with known protein sequences of microbiome gut bacteria will be useful in identification of antigen mimicry between evolutionary conservative protein sequences.

     "abstract": "The recent expanding technical possibilities to detect tumor derived mutations in blood, so-called circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), has rapidly increased the interest in liquid biopsies. This review and meta-analysis explores the clinical value of ctDNA in malignancies of the upper gastro-intestinal tract.PubMed, Cochrane and Embase databases were searched to identify studies reporting the diagnostic, prognostic or predictive value of ctDNA in patients with esophageal, gastric and pancreatic cancer, until January 2017. The diagnostic accuracy and, using random-effect pair-wise meta-analyses, the prognostic value of ctDNA was assessed.A total of 34 studies met the inclusion criteria. For esophageal and gastric cancer, amplification of oncogenes in blood, such as HER2 and MYC, can be relevant for diagnostic purposes, and to predict treatment response in certain patient subpopulations. Given the limited number of studies assessing the role of ctDNA in esophageal and gastric cancer, the meta-analysis estimated the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of ctDNA in pancreatic cancer only (n\u00a0=\u00a010). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of ctDNA as a diagnostic tool in pancreatic cancer were 28% and 95%, respectively. Patients with pancreatic cancer and detectable ctDNA demonstrated a worse overall survival compared to patients with undetectable ctDNA (HR 1.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15\u20133.22, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).The presence of ctDNA is significantly associated with a poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic cancer. The use of ctDNA in clinical practice is promising, although standardization of sequencing techniques and further development of high-sensitive detection methods is needed.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p53 has a variety of roles in responses to various stress signals. In such responses, p53 activates specific transcriptional targets that control cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, angiogenesis, autophagy, metabolism, migration, aging, senescence, and apoptosis. Since p53 has been identified as the most frequently altered gene in human cancers, regulation and stabilization of its normal functions are important. Stability of p53 is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). Furthermore, it is readjusted by deubiquitination via deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that can eliminate ubiquitin from p53. Diverse DUBs directly or indirectly affect the ubiquitination of p53 and, consequently, regulate various cellular processes associated with p53. As maintenance of p53 is regulated by a variety of DUBs, the interaction of DUBs and p53 can affect diseases such as cancer. Currently, DUBs have a central role in our understanding of various cancers, and some have potential in the development of effective therapeutic strategies. This review summarizes the current knowledge of p53 and of the interconnection between p53 and DUBs.",

Moreover, it is known that enteric neurons are involved in intestinal inflammation. However, the role of the ENS in colorectal cancer (CRC) carcinogenesis remains poorly understood, even though processes like perineural invasion and neoneurogenesis are important factors in CRC. Here we summarize how enteric neurons are affected during CRC and discuss the influence of enteric neurons, either direct or indirect, on the development and/or progression of CRC.

These regions can reside within exons of protein-coding genes, despite the vast majority of them localizes within introns or intergenic regions. Several studies have undoubtedly demonstrated that most of these regions are actively transcribed in normal cells/tissues, where they contribute to regulate many cellular processes. Interestingly, these non-coding RNAs exhibit aberrant expression levels in human cancer cells and their expression profiles have been used as prognostic factors in human malignancies, as well as to unambiguously distinguish among distinct cancer types. In this review, we first describe their identification, then we provide some updated information about their genomic localization and classification. More importantly, we discuss about the available literature describing an overview of the mechanisms through which some transcribed UCRs (T-UCR) contribute to cancer progression or to the metastatic spread. To date, the interplay between T-UCRs and microRNAs is the most convincing evidence linking T-UCRs and tumorigenesis. The limitations of these studies and the future challenges to be addressed in order to understand the biological role of T-UCRs are also discussed herein.

The human genome encodes approximately 600 putative E3 ligases and 80 deubiquitinating enzymes and in the majority of cases these enzymes exhibit specificity in sustaining either pro-tumorigenic or tumour repressive responses. In this review, we highlight the known oncogenic and tumour suppressive effects of ubiquitin modifying enzymes in cancer relevant pathways with specific focus on PI3K, MAPK, TGF\u03b2, WNT, and YAP pathways.

     "abstract": "Current anticancer paradigms largely target driver mutations considered integral for cancer cell survival and tumor progression. Although initially successful, many of these strategies are unable to overcome the tremendous heterogeneity that characterizes advanced tumors, resulting in the emergence of resistant disease. Cancer is a rapidly evolving, multifactorial disease that accumulates numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations. This results in wide phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity within the tumor, the complexity of which is further amplified through specific interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. In this context, cancer may be perceived as an \u201cecomolecular\u201d disease that involves cooperation between several neoplastic clones and their interactions with immune cells, stromal fibroblasts, and other cell types present in the microenvironment. This collaboration is mediated by a variety of secreted factors. Cancer is therefore analogous to complex ecosystems such as microbial consortia.In the present article, we comment on the current paradigms and perspectives guiding the development of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics and the potential application of systems biology to untangle the complexity of neoplasia. In our opinion, conceptualization of neoplasia as an ecomolecular disease is warranted. Advances in knowledge pertinent to the complexity and dynamics of interactions within the cancer ecosystem are likely to improve understanding of tumor etiology, pathogenesis, and progression. This knowledge is anticipated to facilitate the design of new and more effective therapeutic approaches that target the tumor ecosystem in its entirety.",

However, there are processes where the relative concentration of NO in different environments may also serve to limit melanoma proliferation. This review serves to outline the roles of NO in melanoma development and proliferation. As demonstrated by multiple in vivo murine models and observations from human tissue, NO may promote melanoma formation and proliferation through its interaction via inhibitory immune cells, inhibition of apoptosis, stimulation of pro-tumorigenic cytokines, activation of tumor associated macrophages, alteration of angiogenic processes, and stimulation of melanoma formation itself.",

It can be categorized based on the gene expression profile, which identifies the distinct molecular subtype. More recently, stromal tissue has been recognized as an important modulator of tumor cell growth, pathogenesis, and progression. Immune cells could drive important clinical characteristics that affect BC outcomes. Subgroups of patients who have tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the stroma may have better response to chemotherapy and favorable long-term prognosis. Accumulating evidence shows that the immune system plays a crucial role in the outcomes of some BC subgroups, especially more aggressive, proliferative ones such as triple-negative and HER2-positive BC. This review article will present data on the role of lymphocyte infiltration in BC prognosis and response to therapy. This review will also introduce the reader to the challenges of applying this promising prognostic and predictive biomarker in clinical practice.",

     "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as important players of cancer initiation and progression through cell-cell communication. They have been recognized as critical mediators of extracellular communications, which promote transformation, growth invasion, and drug-resistance of cancer cells. Interestingly, the secretion and uptake of EVs are regulated in a more controlled manner than previously anticipated. EVs are classified into three groups, (i) exosomes, (ii) microvesicles (MVs), and (iii) apoptotic bodies (ABs), based on their sizes and origins, and novel technologies to isolate and distinguish these EVs are evolving. The biologically functional molecules harbored in these EVs, including nucleic acids, lipids, and proteins, have been shown to induce key signaling pathways in both tumor and tumor microenvironment (TME) cells for exacerbating tumor development. While tumor cell-derived EVs are capable of reprogramming stromal cells to generate a proper tumor cell niche, stromal-derived EVs profoundly affect the growth, resistance, and stem cell properties of tumor cells. This review summarizes and discusses these reciprocal communications through EVs in different types of cancers. Further understanding of the pathophysiological roles of different EVs in tumor progression is expected to lead to the discovery of novel biomarkers in liquid biopsy and development of tumor specific therapeutics. This review will also discuss the translational aspects of EVs and therapeutic opportunities of utilizing EVs in different cancer types.",

In fact, a growing body of studies has been focusing on the resistance mechanisms or the method to overcome it. The limitation of sorafenib efficacy has been partially but not fully elucidated.

It was thought that the main function of tumor cell-associated immune checkpoint molecules would be the modulation (down- or upregulation) of antitumor immune responses. In recent years, however, it has become clear that the expression of immune checkpoint molecules on tumor cells has important consequences on the biology of the tumor cells themselves. In particular, a causal relationship between the expression of these molecules and the acquisition of malignant traits has been demonstrated. Thus, immune checkpoint molecules have been shown to promote the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumor cells, the acquisition of tumor-initiating potential and resistance to apoptosis and antitumor drugs, as well as the propensity to disseminate and metastasize. Herein, we review this evidence, with a main focus on PD-L1, the most intensively investigated tumor cell-associated immune checkpoint molecule and for which most information is available. Then, we discuss more concisely other tumor cell-associated immune checkpoint molecules that have also been shown to induce the acquisition of malignant traits, such as PD-1, B7-H3, B7-H4, Tim-3, CD70, CD28, CD137, CD40 and CD47.

In addition to glucose-derived pyruvate, lactate, fatty acids and amino acids supply substrates to the TCA cycle to sustain mitochondrial metabolism. Here, we discuss how the metabolic flexibility afforded by these multiple mitochondrial inputs allows cancer cells to adapt according to the availability of the different fuels and the microenvironmental conditions such as hypoxia and acidosis.

These inequalities in incidence and/or clinical outcome can only be explained by a multitude of factors, with genetic basis being one of them. Several investigations have provided convincing evidence to support epigenetic regulation of cancer-associated genes, which results in the differential transcriptome and proteome, and may be linked to a pre-disposition of individuals of certain race/ethnicity to early or more aggressive cancers. Recent technological advancements and the ability to quickly analyze whole genome have aided in these efforts, and owing to their relatively easy detection, methylation events are much well-characterized, than the acetylation events, across human populations. The early trend of investigating a pre-determined set of genes for differential epigenetic regulation is paving way for more unbiased screening. This review summarizes our current understanding of the epigenetic events that have been tied to the racial differences in cancer incidence and mortality. A better understanding of the epigenetics of racial diversity holds promise for the design and execution of novel strategies targeting the human epigenome for reducing the disparity gaps.",

They alkylate the DNA bases and give rise to the formation of monoadducts and subsequently interstrand crosslinks (ICL). ICL are critical cytotoxic DNA lesions that link the DNA strands covalently and block DNA replication and transcription. As a result, S phase progression is inhibited and cells are triggered to undergo apoptosis and necrosis, which both contribute to the effectiveness of CNU-based cancer therapy. However, tumor cells resist chemotherapy through the repair of CNU-induced DNA damage. The suicide enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) removes the precursor DNA lesion O6-chloroethylguanine prior to its conversion into ICL. In cells lacking MGMT, the formed ICL evoke complex enzymatic networks to accomplish their removal. Here we discuss the mechanism of ICL repair as a survival strategy of healthy and cancer cells and DNA damage signaling as a mechanism contributing to CNU-induced cell death.

Moreover, the survival of these patients is generally poor, with reports of a 1-year survival rate of 20%. Therefore, a better knowledge about the determinants of brain metastasization is essential for the improvement of the clinical outcomes. Here, we summarize the current data about the metastatic cascade, ranging from the output of cancer cells from the primary tumour to their colonization in the brain, which involves the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, invasion of mammary tissue, intravasation into circulation, and homing into and extravasation towards the brain. The phenotypic change in malignant cells, and the importance of the microenvironment in the formation of brain metastases are also inspected. Finally, the importance of genetic and epigenetic changes, and the recently disclosed effects of microRNAs in brain metastasization of breast cancer are highlighted.",

     "abstract": "Based on the prominent role estrogen receptor (ER) plays in breast cancer, endocrine therapy has been developed to block the ER pathway and has shown great effectiveness. Fulvestrant, the first selective ER down-regulator (SERD), was demonstrated to completely suppress ER\u03b1 and notably efficient. However, resistance to fulvestrant occurs, either intrinsic or acquired during the treatment. Several potential mechanisms inducing fulvestrant resistance have been proposed, composed of activated ER\u03b1-independent compensatory growth factor signaling, stimulated downstream kinases, altered cell cycle mediators, etcetera. Experimentally, combinations of fulvestrant with targeted treatments were reported to eliminate the resistance and improve the effect of fulvestrant. Meanwhile, some clinical trials associated with the targeted combination therapies are in progress. This review focuses on the underlying mechanisms that contribute to fulvestrant resistance in ER-positive breast cancer and provides an overview of combined fulvestrant with targeted agents to shed light on optimal therapies for patients with ER-positive breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (CaP) is often androgen-sensitive malignancy and regresses upon inhibition of androgen signaling. However, CaP, nearly always develops androgen resistance and progresses to aggressive and lethal androgen-independent CaP, which lacks satisfactory therapy. For metastatic CaP, patients are often treated with Taxotere (docetaxel), a cytoskeleton-targeted chemotherapy drug, that provides transient palliative benefit but to which patients rapidly develop drug-resistance. Combination chemotherapy may be used instead, but is more toxic and adds little clinically relevant benefit over docetaxel. Therefore, novel strategies to enhance docetaxel efficacy are needed to effectively treat patients with metastatic CaP. The mercapturic acid pathway, which metabolizes genotoxic and pro-apoptotic toxins, is over-expressed in CaP and plays an important role in carcinogenesis, metastasis and therapy-resistance of CaP. Vicenin-2, a flavonoid derived from Tulsi (holy basil) as an active compound, inhibits the growth of CaP and increases the anti-tumor activity of docetaxel in-vitro and in-vivo. Taken together, the combination of vicenin-2 and docetaxel could be highly effective in the treatment of advanced and metastatic CaP due to their multi-targeting anti-tumor potential.",

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells hijack hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches in the bone marrow and become leukemic stem cells (LSCs) at the expense of normal HSCs. LSCs are quiescent and resistant to chemotherapy and can cause relapse of the disease. HSCs in niches are needed to generate blood cell precursors that are committed to unilineage differentiation and eventually production of mature blood cells, including red blood cells, megakaryocytes, myeloid cells and lymphocytes. Thus far, three types of HSC niches are recognized: endosteal, reticular and perivascular niches. However, we argue here that there is only one type of HSC niche, which consists of a periarteriolar compartment and a perisinusoidal compartment. In the periarteriolar compartment, hypoxia and low levels of reactive oxygen species preserve the HSC pool. In the perisinusoidal compartment, hypoxia in combination with higher levels of reactive oxygen species enables proliferation of progenitor cells and their mobilization into the circulation. Because HSC niches offer protection to LSCs against chemotherapy, we review novel therapeutic strategies to inhibit homing of LSCs in niches for the prevention of dedifferentiation of leukemic cells into LSCs and to stimulate migration of leukemic cells out of niches. These strategies enhance differentiation and proliferation and thus sensitize leukemic cells to chemotherapy. Finally, we list clinical trials of therapies that tackle LSCs in HSC niches to circumvent their protection against chemotherapy.",

This review addresses the structural and functional features of EMPs, detailing their tissue distribution and functions in the human body, their expression pattern in a variety of tumors, and highlighting the underlying mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis. The implications in cancer biology, patient prognosis prediction, and potential application in disease therapy are discussed. For example, EMP1 was reported to be a biomarker of gefitinib resistance in lung cancer and contributes to prednisolone resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients. EMP2 functions as an oncogene in human endometrial and ovarian cancers; however, characteristics of EMP2 in urothelial cancer fulfill the criteria of a suppressor gene. Of particular interest, EMP3 overexpression in breast cancer is significantly related to strong HER-2 expression. Co-expression of HER-2 and EMP3 is the most important indicator of progression-free and metastasis-free survival for patients with urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract.

Tumor glycolysis is pivotal for the efficient management of cellular bioenergetics and uninterrupted cancer growth. Mounting evidence suggests that tumor glycolysis also plays a key role in instigating immunosuppressive networks that are critical for cancer cells to escape immune surveillance (\u201cimmune evasion\u201d). Recent data show that induction of cellular stress or metabolic dysregulation sensitize cancer cells to antitumor immune cells implying that metabolic reprogramming and immune evasion harmonize during cancer progression. However, the molecular link between these two hallmarks of cancer remains obscure. In this review the molecular intricacies of tumor glycolysis that facilitate immune evasion has been discussed in the light of recent research to explore immunotherapeutic potential of targeting cancer metabolism.",

Certainly, while cancer spreading is an early event, metastasis occurs much later during tumour progression and frequently arises several years after primary tumour resection.

     "abstract": "Mitochondria are the sites of pyruvate oxidation, citric acid cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, ketogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. Attenuation of mitochondrial function is one of the most significant changes that occurs in tumor cells, directly linked to oncogenesis, angiogenesis, Warburg effect, and epigenetics. In particular, three mitochondrial enzymes are inactivated in cancer: pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase-2 (HMGCS2). These enzymes are subject to regulation via acetylation/deacetylation. SIRT3, the predominant mitochondrial deacetylase, directly targets these enzymes for deacetylation and maintains their optimal catalytic activity. SIRT3 is a tumor suppressor, and deacetylation of these enzymes contributes to its biological function. PDH catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate into acetyl CoA, SDH oxidizes succinate into fumarate, and HMGCS2 controls the synthesis of the ketone body \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. As the activities of these enzymes are decreased in cancer, tumor cells accumulate lactate and succinate but produce less amounts of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate. Apart from their role in cellular energetics, these metabolites function as signaling molecules via specific cell-surface G-protein-coupled receptors. Lactate signals via GPR81, succinate via GPR91, and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate via GPR109A. In addition, lactate activates hypoxia-inducible factor HIF1\u03b1 and succinate promotes DNA methylation. GPR81 and GPR91 are tumor promoters, and increased production of lactate and succinate as their agonists drives tumorigenesis by enhancing signaling via these two receptors. In contrast, GPR109A is a tumor suppressor, and decreased synthesis of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate as its agonist suppresses signaling via this receptor, thus attenuating the tumor-suppressing function of GPR109A. In parallel with the opposing changes in lactate/succinate and \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate levels, tumor cells upregulate GPR81 and GPR91 but downregulate GPR109A. As such, these three metabolite receptors play a critical role in cancer and represent a new class of drug targets with selective antagonists of GPR81 and GPR91 for cancer treatment and agonists of GPR109A for cancer prevention.",

We distinguish between two frameworks for understanding heterogeneous tumors, both of which can inform treatment strategies: (1) The tumor as diverse ecosystem, a Darwinian population of sometimes-competing, sometimes-cooperating cells; (2) The tumor as tightly integrated, self-regulating organ, which may hijack developmental signals to restore functional heterogeneity after treatment. While the first framework dominates literature on cancer evolution, the second framework enjoys support as well. Throughout this review, we illustrate how mathematical models inform understanding of tumor progression and treatment outcomes.

     "abstract": "By the time the process of oncogenesis has produced an advanced cancer, tumor cells have undergone extensive evolution. The cellular phenotypes resulting from this evolution have been well studied, and include accelerated growth rates, apoptosis resistance, immortality, invasiveness, and immune evasion. Yet with all of our current knowledge of tumor biology, the details of early oncogenesis have been difficult to observe and understand. Where different oncogenic mutations may work together to enhance the survival of a tumor cell, in isolation they are often pro-apoptotic, pro-differentiative or pro-senescent, and therefore often, somewhat paradoxically, disadvantageous to a cell. It is also becoming clear that somatic mutations, including those in known oncogenic drivers, are common in tissues starting at a young age. These observations raise the question: how do we largely avoid cancer for most of our lives? Here we propose that evolutionary forces can help explain this paradox. As humans and other organisms age or experience external insults such as radiation or smoking, the structure and function of tissues progressively degrade, resulting in altered stem cell niche microenvironments. As tissue integrity declines, it becomes less capable of supporting and maintaining resident stem cells. These stem cells then find themselves in a microenvironment to which they are poorly adapted, providing a competitive advantage to those cells that can restore their functionality and fitness through mutations or epigenetic changes. The resulting oncogenic clonal expansions then increase the odds of further cancer progression. Understanding how the causes of cancer, such as aging or smoking, affect tissue microenvironments to control the impact of mutations on somatic cell fitness can help reconcile the discrepancy between marked mutation accumulation starting early in life and the somatic evolution that leads to cancer at advanced ages or following carcinogenic insults.

     "abstract": "It is generally accepted that the initiation and progression of cancers is the result of somatic clonal evolution. Despite many peculiarities, evolution within populations of somatic cells should obey the same Darwinian principles as evolution within natural populations, i.e. variability of heritable phenotypes provides the substrate for context-specific selection forces leading to increased population frequencies of phenotypes, which are better adapted to their environment. Yet, within cancer biology, the more prevalent way to view evolution is as being entirely driven by the accumulation of \u201cdriver\u201d mutations. Context-specific selection forces are either ignored, or viewed as constraints from which tumor cells liberate themselves during the course of malignant progression. In this review, we will argue that explicitly focusing on selection forces acting on the populations of neoplastic cells as the driving force of somatic clonal evolution might provide for a more accurate conceptual framework compared to the mutation-centric driver gene paradigm. Whereas little can be done to counteract the \u201cbad luck\u201d of stochastic occurrences of cancer-related mutations, changes in selective pressures and the phenotypic adaptations they induce can, in principle, be exploited to limit the incidence of cancers and to increase the efficiency of existing and future therapies.

A central challenge in studying tumor evolution is the difficulty in collecting longitudinal samples from cancer patients. Consequently, most studies have inferred tumor evolution from single time-point samples, providing very indirect information. These data have led to several competing models of tumor evolution: linear, branching, neutral and punctuated. Each model makes different assumptions regarding the timing of mutations and selection of clones, and therefore has different implications for the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of cancer patients. Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests that models may change during tumor progression or operate concurrently for different classes of mutations.

     "abstract": "The origin and progression of cancer is widely viewed as \u201csomatic evolution\u201d driven by the accumulation of random genetic changes. This theoretical model, however, neglects fundamental conditions for evolution by natural selection, which include competition for survival and a local environmental context. Recent observations that the mutational burden in different cancers can vary by 2 orders of magnitude and that multiple mutations, some of which are \u201concogenic,\u201d are observed in normal tissue suggests these neglected Darwinian dynamics may play a critical role in modifying the evolutionary consequences of molecular events. Here we discuss evolutionary principles in normal tissue focusing on the dynamical tension between different evolutionary levels of selection. Normal somatic cells within metazoans do not ordinarily evolve because their survival and proliferation are governed by tissue signals and internal controls (e.g. telomere shortening) that maintain homeostatic function. The fitness of each cell is, thus, identical to the whole organism, which is the evolutionary level of selection. For a cell to evolve, it must acquire a self-defined fitness function so that its survival and proliferation is determined entirely by its own heritable phenotypic properties. Cells can develop independence from normal tissue control through randomly accumulating mutations that disrupt its ability to recognize or respond to all host signals. A self-defined fitness function can also be gained non-genetically when tissue control signals are lost due to injury, inflammation, or infection. Accumulating mutations in cells without a self-defined fitness function will produce no evolution - consistent with reports showing mutations, including some that would ordinarily be oncogenic, are present in cells from normal tissue. Furthermore, once evolution begins, Darwinian forces will promote mutations that increase fitness and eliminate those that do not. Thus, cancer cells will typically have a mutational burden similar to adjacent normal cells and many (perhaps most) mutations observed in cancer cells occurred prior to somatic evolution and may not contribute to the cell's malignant phenotype.

     "abstract": "A cell's phenotype is the observable actualization of complex interactions between its genome, epigenome, and local environment. While traditional views in cancer have held that cellular and tumor phenotypes are largely functions of genomic instability, increasing attention has recently been given to epigenetic and microenvironmental influences. Such non-genetic factors allow cancer cells to experience intrinsic diversity and plasticity, and at the tumor level can result in phenotypic heterogeneity and treatment evasion. In 2006, Takahashi and Yamanaka exploited the epigenome's plasticity by \u201creprogramming\u201d differentiated cells into a pluripotent state by inducing expression of a cocktail of four transcription factors. Recent advances in cancer biology have shown not only that cellular reprogramming is possible for malignant cells, but it may provide a foundation for future therapies. Nevertheless, cell reprogramming experiments are frequently plagued by low efficiency, activation of aberrant transcriptional programs, instability, and often rely on expertise gathered from systems which may not translate directly to cancer. Here, we review a theoretical framework tracing back to Waddington's epigenetic landscape which may be used to derive quantitative and qualitative understanding of cellular reprogramming. Implications for tumor heterogeneity, evolution and adaptation are discussed in the context of designing new treatments to re-sensitize recalcitrant tumors. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Evolutionary principles \u2014 heterogeneity in cancer?, edited by Dr. Robert A. Gatenby.",

Autophagy has been widely recognized as a main biological event involved in both the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and in the response of several anticancer drugs. A thorough analysis of scientific literature underlines the reciprocal interplay between mutant p53 proteins and autophagy regulation. In this review, we analytically summarize recent findings, which indicate that gain-of-function (GOF) mutant p53 proteins counteract the autophagic machinery by various molecular mechanisms including the regulation of AMPK and Akt/mTOR pathways, autophagy-related genes (ATGs), HIF-1\u03b1 target genes, and the mitochondrial citrate carrier CIC. Moreover, we report that mutant p53 protein stability is affected by lysosome-mediated degradation through macroautophagy or chaperone-mediated autophagy, suggesting the use of autophagy stimulators to counteract mutant p53 oncogenic activity. Finally, we discuss the functional role of the interplay between mutant p53 proteins and autophagy in cancer progression, a fundamental knowledge to design more effective therapies against cancers bearing mutant TP53 gene.",

According to WHO, >\u00a014 million people per year are diagnosed with cancer and about 8 million die. Anti-cancer strategy includes chemo-, immune- and radiotherapy or their combination. Unfortunately, these widely used strategies often have insufficient efficacy and significant toxic effects on healthy cells. Consequently, the improvement of treatment approaches is an important goal. One of promising schemes to enhance the effect of therapy is the restriction of calorie intake or some nutrients. The combination of caloric restriction or its chemical mimetics along with anti-cancer drugs may suppress growth of tumor cells and enhance death of cancer cells. That will allow the dose of therapeutic drugs to be decreased and their toxic effects to be reduced. Here the possibility of using this combinatory therapy as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying this approach will be discussed.",

These processes are often found upregulated in human cancers, many of which display increased levels of WRN. Therefore, directed inhibition of this RecQ helicase could be beneficial to selective cancer therapy. Inhibition of WRN is feasible by the use of small-molecule inhibitors or application of RNA interference and EGS/RNase P targeting systems. Remarkably, helicase depletion leads to a severe reduction in cell viability due to mitotic catastrophe, which is triggered by replication stress induced by DNA repair failure and fork progression arrest. Moreover, we present new evidence that WRN depletion results in early changes of RNA polymerase III and RNase P activities, thereby implicating chromatin-associated tRNA enzymes in WRN-related stress response. Combined with the recently discovered roles of RecQ helicases in cancer, current data support the targeting prospect of these genome guardians, as a means of developing clinical phases aimed at diminishing adaptive resistance to present targeted therapies.",

In the presence of severe toxic or prolonged ER stress, the pro-survival function of UPRER is transformed into a lethal signal transmitted to and executed through mitochondria. Mitochondria are key for both apoptotic and autophagic cell death. Thus ER is vital in sensing and coordinating stress pathways to maintain overall physiological homeostasis. However, this function is deregulated in cancer, resulting in resistance to apoptosis induction in response to various stressors including therapeutic agents.

     "abstract": "Lonidamine (LND) was initially introduced as an antispermatogenic agent. It was later found to have anticancer activity sensitizing tumors to chemo-, radio-, and photodynamic-therapy and hyperthermia. Although the mechanism of action remained unclear, LND treatment has been known to target metabolic pathways in cancer cells. It has been reported to alter the bioenergetics of tumor cells by inhibiting glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration, while indirect evidence suggested that it also inhibited l-lactic acid efflux from cells mediated by members of the proton-linked monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) family and also pyruvate uptake into the mitochondria by the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC). Recent studies have demonstrated that LND potently inhibits MPC activity in isolated rat liver mitochondria (Ki 2.5\u00a0\u03bcM) and cooperatively inhibits l-lactate transport by MCT1, MCT2 and MCT4 expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes with K0.5 and Hill coefficient values of 36\u201340\u00a0\u03bcM and 1.65\u20131.85, respectively. In rat heart mitochondria LND inhibited the MPC with similar potency and uncoupled oxidation of pyruvate was inhibited more effectively (IC50\u00a0~\u00a07\u00a0\u03bcM) than other substrates including glutamate (IC50\u00a0~\u00a020\u00a0\u03bcM). LND inhibits the succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity of respiratory Complex II without fully blocking succinate dehydrogenase activity. LND also induces cellular reactive oxygen species through Complex II and has been reported to promote cell death by suppression of the pentose phosphate pathway, which resulted in inhibition of NADPH and glutathione generation. We conclude that MPC inhibition is the most sensitive anti-tumour target for LND, with additional inhibitory effects on MCT-mediated l-lactic acid efflux, Complex II and glutamine/glutamate oxidation.",

Importantly, aspirin assumes pleiotropic effects by targeting multiple molecules. It could further target the unique tumor biology of pancreatic cancer and modify the cancer microenvironment, thus showing remarkable therapeutic potentials. Besides, aspirin could reverse the chemoradiation resistance by repressing tumor repopulation and exert synergistic potentials with metformin on pancreatic cancer chemoprevention. Moreover, aspirin secondarily benefits pancreatic cancer patients through modestly reducing cancer pain and the risk of venous thromboembolism. Furthermore, new aspirin derivatives and delivery systems might help to improve risk-to-benefit ratio. In brief, aspirin is a promising chemopreventive agent and exerts significant therapeutic potentials in pancreatic cancer.",

As intrinsic factors for metabolic plasticity, K-ras activation and mutations in other tumor suppressor genes induce abnormal mitochondrial metabolism and enhance glycolysis, with alterations in glutamine and lipid metabolism. As extrinsic factors, the acidic and oxygen/nutrient-deprived microenvironment also induces cancer cells to reprogram their metabolic pathway and hijack stromal cells (mainly cancer-associated fibroblasts and immunocytes) to communicate, thereby adapting to metabolic stress. Therefore, a better understanding of the metabolic features of PDA will contribute to the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",

TIF-IA is a transcription factor that connects RNA polymerase I with the UBF/SL-1 complex to initiate the transcription of pre-ribosomal RNA. Its function is conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to mammals, and its activity is promoted by the phosphorylation of various oncogenic kinases in cancer cells. The depletion of TIF-IA induces cell death in lung cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts but not in several other normal tissue types evaluated in knock-out studies. Furthermore, the nuclear accumulation of TIF-IA under UTP down-regulated conditions requires the activity of LKB1 kinase, and LKB1-inactivated cancer cells are susceptible to cell death under such stress conditions. Therefore, TIF-IA may be a unique target to suppress ribosome biogenesis without significantly impacting the survival of normal tissues.",

Despite the fall in diagnoses and mortality, the reported incidence of metastatic disease has increased 72% since 2004. Prostate cancer arises in cohesive groups as intraepithelial neoplasia, migrates through muscle and leaves the gland via perineural invasion for hematogenous dissemination. Current technological advances have shown cohesive-clusters of tumor (also known as microemboli) within the circulation. Circulating tumor cell (CTC) profiles are indicative of disseminated prostate cancer, and disseminated tumor cells (DTC) are found in cohesive-clusters, a phenotypic characteristic of both radiation- and drug-resistant tumors. Recent reports in cell biology and informatics, coupled with mass spectrometry, indicate that the integrin adhesome network provides an explanation for the biophysical ability of cohesive-clusters of tumor cells to invade thorough muscle and nerve microenvironments while maintaining adhesion-dependent therapeutic resistance. Targeting cohesive-clusters takes advantage of the known ability of extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion to promote tumor cell survival and represents an approach that has the potential to avoid the progression to drug- and radiotherapy-resistance.

Hence, we performed this thorough review by summarizing the tumorigenic role of each component along the AMPK signaling, comprising of both its upstream and downstream effectors. Moreover, their functional interplay with the AMPK heterotrimer and exclusive efficacies in carcinogenesis were chiefly explained among genetically altered mice models. Importantly, the pharmaceutical investigations of AMPK relevant medications have also been highlighted. In summary, in this review, we not only elucidate the potential functions of AMPK signaling pathway in governing tumorigenesis, but also potentiate the future targeted strategy aiming for better treatment of aberrant metabolism-associated diseases, including cancer.",

This review begins with a brief introduction of PTN and the regulation of its expression. PTN receptors are described with special emphasis on RPTP\u03b2/\u03b6, which also interacts with and/or affects the function of other important targets for cancer therapy, such as vascular endothelial growth factor A, \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 and cell surface nucleolin.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy is the major cause of treatment failure. Previous research has focused mainly on strategies to reverse MDR by targeting the MDR1 gene encoded P-glycoprotein (Pgp) with small molecular compound inhibitors. However, prior Pgp inhibitors have shown very limited clinical success because these agents have relatively low potency and high toxicity. Therefore, identification of more specific and potent new inhibitors would be useful. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that cancer stem cells (CSCs), deregulated non-coding RNA (ncRNA), autophagy, and tumor heterogeneity also contribute significantly to drug sensitivity/resistance in ovarian cancer. This review summarizes these novel mechanisms of MDR and evaluates several new concepts to overcome MDR in the treatment of ovarian cancer. These new strategies include overcoming MDR with more potent and specific Pgp inhibitors, targeting CSCs and ncRNA, modulating autophagy signaling pathway, and targeting tumor heterogeneity.",

     "abstract": "Despite significant clinical advancements, cancer remains a leading cause of mortality throughout the world due largely to the process of metastasis and the dissemination of cancer cells from their primary tumor of origin to distant secondary sites. The clinical burden imposed by metastasis is further compounded by a paucity of information regarding the factors that mediate metastatic progression. Linear chromosomes are capped by structures known as telomeres, which dictate cellular lifespan in humans by shortening progressively during successive cell divisions. Although telomere shortening occurs in nearly all somatic cells, telomeres may be elongated via two seemingly disjoint pathways: (i) telomerase-mediated extension, and (ii) homologous recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Both telomerase and ALT are activated in various human cancers, with more recent evidence implicating both pathways as potential mediators of metastasis. Here we review the known roles of telomere homeostasis in metastasis and posit a mechanism whereby metastatic activity is determined by a dynamic fluctuation between ALT and telomerase, as opposed to the mere activation of a generic telomere elongation program. Additionally, the pleiotropic nature of the telomere processing machinery makes it an attractive therapeutic target for metastasis, and as such, we also explore the therapeutic implications of our proposed mechanism.",

The recently solved PGRMC1 structure revealed that heme-binding involves coordination by a tyrosinate ion at Y113, and induces dimerization which is stabilized by hydrophobic stacking of heme on adjacent monomers. Dimerization is required for association with cytochrome P450 (cyP450) enzymes, which mediates chemoresistance to doxorubicin and may be responsible for PGRMC1's anti-apoptotic activity. Here we review the multiple attested involvement of PGRMC1 in diverse functions, including regulation of cytochrome P450, steroidogenesis, vesicle trafficking, progesterone signaling and mitotic spindle and cell cycle regulation. Its wide range of biological functions is attested to particularly by its emerging association with cancer and progesterone-responsive female reproductive tissues. PGRMC1 exhibits all the hallmarks of a higher order nexus signal integration hub protein. It appears capable of acting as a detector that integrates information from kinase/phosphatase pathways with heme and CO levels and probably redox status.",

Because of their important regulatory roles in many key physiological processes, dysregulation of signalings controlled by these receptors is associated with many diseases including cancer. Over years, studies of orphan NRs have become an area of great interest because their specific physiological and pathological roles have not been well-defined, and some of them are promising drug targets for diseases. The recently identified synthetic small molecule ligands, acting as agonists or antagonists, to these orphan NRs not only help to understand better their functional roles but also highlight that the signalings mediated by these ligand-independent NRs in diseases could be therapeutically intervened. This review is a summary of the recent advances in elucidating the emerging functional roles of orphan NRs in cancers, especially prostate cancer. In particular, some orphan NRs, ROR\u03b3, TR2, TR4, COUP-IFII, ERR\u03b1, DAX1 and SHP, exhibit crosstalk or interference with androgen receptor (AR) signaling in either normal or malignant prostatic cells, highlighting their involvement in prostate cancer progression as androgen and AR signaling pathway play critical roles in this process.

Hypoxia is the consequence not only of the chaotic proliferation of cancer cells that places them at distance from the nearest capillary but also of the abnormal structure of the new vasculature network resulting in transient blood flow.

Most of the current work aims at understanding the role of chronic hypoxia in tumor growth, response to treatment and metastasis. Only recently, cycling hypoxia, with spatial and temporal fluctuations in oxygen levels, has emerged as another key feature of the tumor environment that triggers different responses in comparison to chronic hypoxia. Either type of hypoxia is associated with distinct effects not only in cancer cells but also in stromal cells. In particular, cycling hypoxia has been demonstrated to favor, to a higher extent than chronic hypoxia, angiogenesis, resistance to anti-cancer treatments, intratumoral inflammation and tumor metastasis. These review details these effects as well as the signaling pathway it triggers to switch on specific transcriptomic programs. Understanding the signaling pathways through which cycling hypoxia induces these processes that support the development of an aggressive cancer could convey to the emergence of promising new cancer treatments.",

Here we performed a systematic review on DNA methylation-based biomarkers published in CRC, and discussed the current state of findings and future challenges. Based on the findings, we then provide a perspective on future studies. Genome-wide studies on DNA methylation revealed novel biomarkers as well as distinct subgroups that exist in CRC. For diagnostic purposes, the most independently validated genes to study further are VIM, SEPT9, ITGA4, OSM4, GATA4 and NDRG4. These hypermethylated biomarkers can even be combined with LINE1 hypomethylation and the performance of markers should be examined in comparison to FIT further to find sensitive combinations. In terms of prognostic markers, myopodin, KISS1, TMEFF2, HLTF, hMLH1, APAF1, BCL2 and p53 are independently validated. Most prognostic markers published lack both a multivariate analysis in comparison to clinical risk factors and the appropriate patient group who will benefit by adjuvant chemotherapy. Methylation of IGFBP3, mir148a and PTEN are found to be predictive markers for 5-FU and EGFR therapy respectively. For therapy prediction, more studies should focus on finding markers for chemotherapeutic drugs as majority of the patients would benefit. Translation of these biomarkers into clinical utility would require large-scale prospective cohorts and randomized clinical trials in future. Based on these findings and consideration we propose an avenue to introduce methylation markers into clinical practice in near future. For future studies, multi-omics profiling on matched tissue and non-invasive cohorts along with matched cohorts of adenoma to carcinoma is indispensable to concurrently stratify CRC and find novel, robust biomarkers. Moreover, future studies should examine the timing and heterogeneity of methylation as well as the difference in methylation levels between epithelial and stromal tissues.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is one of the most malignant human tumors. Perineural invasion, whereby a cancer cell invades the perineural spaces surrounding nerves, is acknowledged as a gradual contributor to cancer aggressiveness. Furthermore, perineural invasion is considered one of the root causes of the recurrence and metastasis observed after pancreatic resection, and it is also an independent predictor of prognosis. Advanced research has demonstrated that the neural microenvironment is closely associated with perineural invasion in pancreatic cancer. Therapy targeting the molecular mechanism of perineural invasion may enable the durable clinical treatment of this formidable disease. This review provides an overview of the present status of perineural invasion, the relevant molecular mechanisms of perineural invasion, pain and hyperglycemia associated with perineural invasion in pancreatic cancer, and the targeted therapeutics based on these studies.",

     "abstract": "The connexins constitute a family of integral membrane proteins that form intercellular channels, enabling adjacent cells to directly exchange ions and small molecules. The connexin channels assemble into distinct plasma membrane domains known as gap junctions. Intercellular communication via gap junctions has an important role in regulating cell growth and differentiation, as well as in maintaining tissue homeostasis. Connexin43 (Cx43), the most ubiquitously expressed connexin isoform in human tissues, has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor and is frequently downregulated during cancer development. Cx43 has a short half-life, and modulation of the Cx43 turnover rate represents an important mechanism by which the level of gap junctional intercellular communication is regulated under basal conditions. Moreover, many growth factors, oncogenes, and tumor promoters are potent inducers of Cx43 endocytosis and endolysosomal degradation, resulting in loss of gap junctions. Emerging evidence indicates that the ubiquitin system has a major role in these processes. Recent studies have shown that ubiquitination is also involved in the autophagy-mediated degradation of Cx43 in a process mediated by the proto-oncogenic E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4. Moreover, ubiquitination of connexins has been implicated in modulating the level of intercellular communication via gap junctions in response to oxidative stress. This review article provides an overview of our current understanding of the role of the ubiquitin system in the regulation of connexins and discusses how the malfunction of these processes may contribute to the loss of intercellular communication via gap junctions during carcinogenesis.",

However, some cancer cells survive and become variants, being poorly immunogenic and able to enter a steady-state phase. These cells become functionally dormant or remain hidden clinically throughout. Neoplastic cells seem to be able to instruct immune cells to undergo changes promoting malignancy. Radiotherapy may act as a trigger of the immune response. After radiotherapy a sequence of reactions occurs, starting in the damage of oncogenic cells by multiple mechanisms, leading to the immune system positive feedback against the tumor. The link between radiotherapy and the immune system is evident. T cells, macrophages, Natural Killer cells and other immune cells seem to have a key role in controlling the tumor. T cells may be dysfunctional and remain in a state of T cell exhaustion, nonetheless, they often retain a high potential for successful defense against cancer, being able to be mobilized to become highly functional. The lack of clinical trials on a large scale makes data a little robust, in spite of promising information, there are still many variables in the studies relating to radiation and immune system.

     "abstract": "There are numerous reports that melatonin inhibits the hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF-1\u03b1, and the HIF-1\u03b1-inducible gene, VEGF, both in vivo and in vitro. Through the inhibition of the HIF-1-VEGF pathway, melatonin reduces hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. Herein we discuss the interaction of melatonin with HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b1-inducible genes in terms of what is currently known concerning the HIF-1\u03b1 hypoxia response element (HIF-1\u03b1-HRE) pathway.The von Hippel\u2013Lindau protein (VHL), also known as the VHL tumor suppressor, functions as part of a ubiquitin ligase complex which recognizes HIF-1\u03b1 as a substrate. As such, VHL is part of the oxygen sensing mechanism of the cell. Under conditions of hypoxia, HIF-1\u03b1 stimulates the transcription of numerous HIF-1\u03b1-induced genes, including EPO, VEGF, and PFKFB3; the latter is an enzyme which regulates glycolysis. Data from several studies show that ROS generated in mitochondria under conditions of hypoxia stimulate HIF-1\u03b1. Since melatonin acts as an antioxidant and reduces ROS, these data suggest that the antioxidant action of melatonin could account for reduced HIF-1, less VEGF, and reduced glycolysis in cancer cells (Warburg effect). A direct or indirect inhibitory action (via the reduction in ROS) of melatonin on proteasome activity would account for much of the published data.",

The misexpression of PLK-1 causes the abnormalities including aneuploidy, mitotic defects, leading to tumorigenesis through inhibiting the p53 and pRB genes.

Extensive functional analyses of p53 and its tumor-associated mutants have illuminated many of the common defects shared by most cancer cells. As the central character in a tale that continues to unfold, p53 has become increasingly familiar and yet remains surprisingly inscrutable. New relationships periodically come to light, and surprising, novel activities continue to emerge, thereby revealing new dimensions and aspects of its function. What lies at the very core of this complex protagonist? What is its prime motivation? As every avid reader knows, the elements of character are profoundly shaped by adversity \u2014 originating from within and without. And so it is with p53. This review will briefly recap the coordinated responses of p53 to viral infection, and outline a hypothetical model that would explain how an abundance of seemingly unrelated phenotypic attributes may in the end reflect a singular function.

Recent studies demonstrate that programmed cell death is not confined to caspase-dependent apoptosis, but includes necroptosis, a form of necrotic death governed by Receptor-Interacting Protein 1 (RIP1), RIP3, and Mixed Lineage Kinase Domain-Like (MLKL) protein. Necroptosis serves as a critical cell-killing mechanism in response to severe stress and blocked apoptosis, and can be induced by inflammatory cytokines or chemotherapeutic drugs. Genetic or epigenetic alterations of necroptosis regulators such as RIP3 and cylindromatosis (CYLD), are frequently found in human tumors. Unlike apoptosis, necroptosis elicits a more robust immune response that may function as a defensive mechanism by eliminating tumor-causing mutations and viruses. Furthermore, several classes of anticancer agents currently under clinical development, such as SMAC and BH3 mimetics, can promote necroptosis in addition to apoptosis. A more complete understanding of the interplay among necroptosis, apoptosis, and other cell death modalities is critical for developing new therapeutic strategies to enhance killing of tumor cells.",

     "abstract": "Cancer constitutes a set of diseases with heterogeneous molecular pathologies. However, there are a number of universal aberrations common to all cancers, one of these being the epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs). The silencing of TSGs is thought to be an early, driving event in the oncogenic process. With this in consideration, great efforts have been made to develop small molecules aimed at the restoration of TSGs in order to limit tumor cell proliferation and survival. However, the molecular forces that drive the broad epigenetic reprogramming and transcriptional repression of these genes remain ill-defined. Undoubtedly, understanding the molecular underpinnings of transcriptionally silenced TSGs will aid us in our ability to reactivate these key anti-cancer targets. Here, we describe what we consider to be the five most logical molecular mechanisms that may account for this widely observed phenomenon: 1) ablation of transcription factor binding, 2) overexpression of DNA methyltransferases, 3) disruption of CTCF binding, 4) elevation of EZH2 activity, 5) aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs. The strengths and weaknesses of each proposed mechanism is highlighted, followed by an overview of clinical efforts to target these processes.",

While encouraging, more needs to be done to induce durable effects in a higher proportion of patients. Increasing anti-tumor effector T cell quantity or quality alone does not necessarily correlate with therapeutic outcome. Instead, the tumor microenvironment is a critical determinant of anti-cancer responsiveness to immunotherapy and can confer profound resistance. Yet, the tumor-promoting environment \u2013 due to its enormous plasticity \u2013 also delivers the best opportunities for adjuvant therapy aiming at recruiting, priming and sustaining anti-tumor cytotoxicity. While the tumor environment as an entity is increasingly well understood, current interventions are still broad and often systemic. In contrast, tumors grow in a highly compartmentalized environment which includes the vascular/perivascular niche, extracellular matrix components and in some tumors lymph node aggregates; all of these structures harbor and instruct subsets of immune cells. Targeting and re-programming specific compartments may provide better opportunities for adjuvant immunotherapy.",

     "abstract": "The senescent phenotype was first described in 1961 as a phenomenon characterized by the cessation of cellular division. After years of debate as to whether it represented a tissue culture artifact or an important biological process, it is now appreciated that senescence plays an important role in tumorigenesis. Further, senescence is integral to normal biological processes such as embryogenesis and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. Now with defined roles in development, wound healing, tumor promotion and tumor suppression, it is not surprising that attention has turned to refining our understanding of the mechanisms behind, and consequences of, the induction of senescence. One emerging role for senescence lies in the ability of senescence to orchestrate an inflammatory response: factors secreted by senescent cells have been identified in multiple contexts to modulate various aspects of the immune response. As with many of the previously described roles for senescence, the type of inflammation established by the senescence phenotype is varied and dependent on context. In this review, we discuss the current state of the field with a focus on the paradoxical outcomes of the senescence-induced inflammatory responses in the context of cancer. A more complete understanding of senescence and an appreciation for its complexities will be important for eventual development of senescence-targeted therapies.",

     "abstract": "The tumor-promoting role of macrophages has been firmly established in most cancer types. However, macrophage identity has been a matter of debate, since several levels of complexity result in considerable macrophage heterogeneity. Ontogenically, tissue-resident macrophages derive from yolk sac progenitors which either directly or via a fetal liver monocyte intermediate differentiate into distinct macrophage types during embryogenesis and are maintained throughout life, while a disruption of the steady state mobilizes monocytes and instructs the formation of monocyte-derived macrophages. Histologically, the macrophage phenotype is heavily influenced by the tissue microenvironment resulting in molecularly and functionally distinct macrophages in distinct organs. Finally, a change in the tissue microenvironment as a result of infectious or sterile inflammation instructs different modes of macrophage activation. These considerations are relevant in the context of tumors, which can be considered as sites of chronic sterile inflammation encompassing subregions with distinct environmental conditions (for example, hypoxic versus normoxic). Here, we discuss existing evidence on the role of macrophage subpopulations in steady state tissue and primary tumors of the breast, lung, pancreas, brain and liver.",

Tumor-derived cytokines and growth factors induce an altered hematopoiesis that modifies the myeloid cell differentiation process, promoting proliferation and expansion of cells with immunosuppressive skills, namely myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). MDSCs promote tumor growth not only by shaping immune responses towards tumor tolerance, but also by supporting several processes necessary for the neoplastic progression such as tumor angiogenesis, cancer stemness, and metastasis dissemination. Thus, MDSC targeting represents a promising tool to eliminate host immune dysfunctions and increase the efficacy of immune-based cancer therapies.",

Significant effort is required to develop reliable, broadly applicable immunotherapies for cancer patients. A major innovation was transplantation with hematopoietic stem cells from genetically distinct donors for patients with hematologic malignancies. In this setting, donor T cells induce long-term remission by keeping cancer cells in check through powerful allogeneic graft-versus-leukemia effects. More recently, a long awaited breakthrough for patients with solid tissue cancers was achieved, by means of therapeutic blockade of T cell inhibitory receptors. In untreated cancer patients, T cells are dysfunctional and remain in a state of T cell \u201cexhaustion\u201d. Nonetheless, they often retain a high potential for successful defense against cancer, indicating that many T cells are not entirely and irreversibly exhausted but can be mobilized to become highly functional.

Such vaccines could induce enhanced tumor-specific immune response since neo-antigens are mutation-derived antigens that can be recognized by high affinity T cells, not limited by central tolerance. Alternatively, the use of personalized vaccines based on whole autologous tumor cells, overcome the need for the identification of specific tumor antigens. Whole autologous tumor cells could be administered alone, pulsed on dendritic cells as lysate, DNA, RNA or delivered to dendritic cells in-vivo through encapsulation in nanoparticle vehicles.

BEX1 expression is lost in a subgroup of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Expression of BEX1 controls cell surface receptor signaling and restores imatinib response in resistant cells. BEX2 is overexpressed in a group of breast cancer patients and also in gliomas. Increased BEX2 expression led to enhanced NF-\u03baB signaling as well as cell proliferation. Although BEX2 acts as tumor promoter in a subset of breast cancer, BEX3 expression displayed an opposite role. Overexpression of BEX3 resulted in inhibition of tumor formation in breast cancer mouse xenograft models. The role of BEX4 and BEX5 in cancer has not yet been defined.

The transition between each state is likely a dynamic rather than a static, permanent change. This is referred to as \u201cphenotype switching\u201d. Wnt signaling pathways drive phenotypic changes and promote therapy resistance in melanoma, as well as play roles in the modulation of the immune microenvironment. Three Wnt signaling pathways play a role in melanoma progression, canonical (\u03b2-catenin dependent), polar cell polarity (PCP), and the Wnt/Ca2\u00a0+ pathway. Here we summarize phenotype plasticity and its role in therapy resistance and immune evasion. Targeting the Wnt signaling pathways may be an effective way to overcome tumor plasticity in melanoma.",

     "abstract": "The function of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) in cellular trafficking, membrane fusion and vesicle release in synaptic nerve terminals is well characterised. Recent studies suggest that SNAREs are also important in the control of tumourigenesis through the regulation of multiple signalling and transportation pathways. The majority of published studies investigated the effects of knockdown/knockout or overexpression of particular SNAREs on the normal function of cells as well as their dysfunction in tumourigenesis promotion. SNAREs are involved in the regulation of cancer cell invasion, chemo-resistance, the transportation of autocrine and paracrine factors, autophagy, apoptosis and the phosphorylation of kinases essential for cancer cell biogenesis. This evidence highlights SNAREs as potential targets for novel cancer therapy. This is the first review to summarise the expression and role of SNAREs in cancer biology at the cellular level, their interaction with non-SNARE proteins and modulation of cellular signalling cascades. Finally, a strategy is proposed for developing novel anti-cancer therapeutics using targeted delivery of a SNARE-inactivating protease into malignant cells.",

Efforts have been made towards the development of the viable solution for its treatment with constrained accomplishment because of its complex biology. It is well established that pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs), albeit present in a little count, contribute incredibly to PC initiation, progression, and metastasis. Customary chemo and radiotherapeutic alternatives, however, expands general survival, the related side effects are the significant concern. Amid the most recent decade, our insight about molecular and cellular pathways involved in PC and role of CSCs in its progression has increased enormously. Presently the focus is to target CSCs. The herbal products have gained much consideration recently as they, usually, sensitize CSCs to chemotherapy and target molecular signaling involved in various tumors including PC. Some planned studies have indicated promising results proposing that examinations in this course have a lot to offer for the treatment of PC. Although preclinical studies uncovered the importance of herbal products in attenuating pancreatic carcinoma, limited studies have been conducted to evaluate their role in clinics. The present review provides a new insight to recent advances in pancreatic cancer biology, treatment and current status of herbal products in its anticipation.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is a complex and multifactorial disease. Various factors such as genetic, immunological, epigenetic and environmental constitute minor risk factors with their additive effects contributing to the advent of colorectal cancer. In order to evaluate the role of innate and adaptive immunity in the susceptibility, the presentation and the development of colorectal cancer, we considered an immunogenetic approach on polymorphisms in the TLR4 gene and NOD2/CARD15 gene (receptors of innate immunity) as well as in cytokine genes of the TH17 pathway IL17A, IL17F and cytokine receptor IL23R. Then, we evaluated the expression of microRNAs regulated by TLR4 and NOD2/CARD15 or targeting TLR4, IL17 and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF) induced by IL17. Through a case\u2013control study, we showed that the polymorphism of IL17A is associated with its susceptibility to colorectal cancer. Considering the tumor location, we found that the mutated alleles of IL17A, IL17F and IL23R are rather associated with colon cancer and not with rectum cancer. This result confirms that the colon and rectum are two different physiological entities. This study shows that TLR4, IL17A/F and IL23R polymorphisms are involved in the presentation of the disease with regard to tumor architecture, histology, and differentiation, advanced stage of the disease and lymph node and metastasis. Overall, these polymorphisms are associated with a poor prognosis of the disease. Furthermore, in order to evaluate the involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in the occurrence of colorectal cancer, we aimed at analyzing the tumor compared to a normal adjacent tissue and the expression of miRNAs (miR21, miR146a, miR135a, miR147b and miR155) that regulate immunity genes especially the cytokines of the TH17 pathway. This research has shown that microRNAs 21, 135a and 146a are associated with colorectal cancer. Indeed, these three miRs are overexpressed in cancer tissue compared to healthy tissue. These results clearly confirm the involvement of epigenetics in colorectal cancer. In other words, this study reveals the importance of immunity and specifically the TH17 pathway in the development and presentation of colorectal cancer. These results suggest that TLR4, IL17A, IL17F and IL23R polymorphisms as well as the expression of microRNAs that regulate inflammation and the TH17 pathway are associated with the evolution and progression of the colorectal tumor that could be considered as biomarkers in colorectal cancer.",

     "abstract": "Twenty years have passed since the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Breast tumor kinase (BRK) was cloned. While BRK is evolutionarily related to the Src family kinases it forms its own distinct sub-family referred here to as the BRK family kinases. The detection of BRK in over 60% of breast carcinomas two decades ago and more remarkably, its absence in the normal mammary gland attributed to its recognition as a mammary gland-specific potent oncogene and led BRK researchers on a wild chase to characterize the role of the enzyme in breast cancer. Where has this chase led us? An increasing number of studies have been focused on understanding the cellular roles of BRK in breast carcinoma and normal tissues. A majority of such studies have proposed an oncogenic function of BRK in breast cancers. Thus far, the vast evidence gathered highlights a regulatory role of BRK in critical cellular processes driving tumor formation such as cell proliferation, migration and metastasis. Functional characterization of BRK has identified several signaling proteins that work in concert with the enzyme to sustain such a malignant phenotype. As such targeting the non-receptor tyrosine kinase has been proposed as an attractive approach towards therapeutic intervention. Yet much remains to be explored about (a) the discrepant expression levels of BRK in cancer versus normal conditions, (b) the dependence on the enzymatic activity of BRK to promote oncogenesis and (c) an understanding of the normal physiological roles of the enzyme. This review outlines the advances made towards understanding the cellular and physiological roles of BRK, the mechanisms of action of the protein and its therapeutic significance, in the context of breast cancer.",

Activating germline or somatic mutations of genes encoding Hh pathway components are found in Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and Medulloblastoma (MB). Ligand-dependent Hedgehog hyperactivation, due to autocrine or paracrine mechanisms, is also observed in a large number of malignancies of the breast, colon, skin, bladder, pancreas and other tissues. The key tumorigenic role of Hedgehog has prompted effort aimed at identifying inhibitors of this signaling. To date, only the antagonists of the membrane transducer Smo have been approved for therapy or are under clinical trials in patients with BCC and MB linked to Ptch or Smo mutations. Despite the good initial response, patients treated with Smo antagonists have eventually developed resistance due to the occurrence of compensating mechanisms. Furthermore, Smo antagonists are not effective in tumors where the Hedgehog hyperactivation is due to mutations of pathway components downstream of Smo, or in case of non-canonical, Smo-independent activation of the Gli transcription factors. For all these reasons, the research of Hh inhibitors acting downstream of Smo is becoming an area of intensive investigation. In this review we illustrate the progresses made in the identification of effective Hedgehog inhibitors and their application in cancer, with a special emphasis on the newly identified downstream inhibitors. We describe in detail the Gli inhibitors and illustrate their mode of action and applications in experimental and/or clinical settings.",

Here we critically re-appraise this paradigm in light of recent high-throughput, quantitative genome-wide studies on thousands of human samples of various tumors and new investigations of the role of Runx3 in mouse cancer models. Collectively, these studies unequivocally demonstrate that RUNX3 is not a bona fide cell-autonomous TSG. Accordingly, RUNX3 is not recognized as a TSG and is not included among the 2000 cancer genes listed in the \u201cCancer Gene Census\u201d or \u201cNetwork for Cancer Genes\u201d repositories. In contrast, RUNX3 does play important functions in immunity and inflammation and may thereby indirectly influence epithelial tumor development.",

     "abstract": "Microtubules, an important cytoskeletal protein involved in mitotic and non-mitotic functions of cells, are important targets in cancer therapy. Microtubule-stabilizing drugs like the taxanes are critical adjuvant and palliative first-line therapies for the treatment of early, advanced and metastatic solid tumors of different lineages. Their adverse on- and off-target effects and high susceptibility to multidrug resistance, however, are major challenges encountered in the clinic in the treatment of solid cancers. Although biochemical resistance to microtubule-stabilizing drugs has been well characterized, molecular mechanisms that contribute to clinical resistance to taxanes in solid tumors still remain poorly understood and uncontrolled. The heterogeneous tumor microenvironment leads to greater diversity of resistance mechanisms to taxanes. Tumor hypoxia, a prominent feature of solid tumors, results in a broad range of effects on a number of cellular pathways and is one of the major contributors to the development of resistance to not only microtubule-stabilizing drugs but also other anticancer drugs. In this review, we highlight the potential role of hypoxia in the development of resistance to taxanes through mechanisms that involve altering the cell cycle, changing the properties of microtubules, and inducing the overexpression of gene products that contribute to drug resistance. Hypoxia-induced challenges described in this review are not limited to microtubule-stabilizing drugs alone, but in many cases also impact on treatment with non-microtubule-targeting anticancer drugs.",

In the last two decades, several galectin family members have emerged as versatile modulators of tumor progression. This has initiated the development and preclinical assessment of galectin-targeting compounds. With the first compounds now entering clinical trials it is pivotal to gain insight in the diagnostic and prognostic value of galectins in cancer as this will allow a more rational selection of the patients that might benefit most from galectin-targeted therapies. Here, we present a systematic review of galectin expression in human cancer patients. Malignant transformation is frequently associated with altered galectin expression, most notably of galectin-1 and galectin-3. In most cancers, increased galectin-1 expression is associated with poor prognosis while elevated galectin-9 expression is emerging as a marker of favorable disease outcome. The prognostic value of galectin-3 appears to be tumor type dependent and the other galectins require further investigation. Regarding the latter, additional studies using larger patient cohorts are essential to fully unravel the diagnostic and prognostic value of galectin expression. Furthermore, to better compare different findings, consensus should be reached on how to assess galectin expression, not only with regard to localization within the tissue and within cellular compartments but also regarding alternative splicing and genomic variations. Finally, linking galectin expression and function to aberrant glycosylation in cancer cells will improve our understanding of how these versatile proteins can be exploited for diagnostic, prognostic and even therapeutic purposes in cancer patients.",

Aspirin's ability to act on multiple key metabolic and signaling pathways via inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, as well as through COX-independent mechanisms, makes it particularly relevant in the fight against cancer. A growing body of evidence indicates that aspirin may not only reduce cancer risk, but also prevent metastasis and angiogenesis while slowing the rate of mutation-inducing DNA damage. These emerging benefits of aspirin are offset to some extent by the known risks of treatment, such as cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal bleeding. However, it has been shown that pre-treatment risk assessment of individual patients and the use of proton pump inhibitors or Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy concomitantly with aspirin treatment can reduce these potential risks. Thus, the significant benefits of aspirin treatment, coupled with recent data concerning its risks, may prove to tip the balance in favor of aspirin use in cancer prevention.",

Reversal of this process by deubiquitination is a central step in the maintenance and regulation of cellular homeostasis. It now appears that the regulation of ubiquitin pathways by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) could be used as targets for anticancer therapy. Recent success in inducing apoptosis in cancerous cells by USP17, a cytokine-inducible DUB encoding two hyaluronan binding motifs (HABMs) showing direct interaction with hyaluronan (HA), could prove a promising step in the development of DUBs containing HABMs as agents in anticancer therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the importance of hyaluronan (HA) in cancer, the role played by DUBs in apoptosis, and a possible relationship between DUBs and HA in cancerous cells, suggesting new strategies for applying DUB enzymes as potential anticancer therapeutics.",

Initial animal models indicated a degree of compensatory overlap between ID genes such that deletion of multiple ID genes was required to generate easily recognizable phenotypes. More recently, new model systems have revealed alterations in mice harboring deletions in single ID genes suggesting complex gene and tissue specific functions for members of the ID gene family. Because ID genes are highly expressed during development and their function is associated with a primitive, proliferative cellular phenotype there has been significant interest in understanding their potential roles in neoplasia. Indeed, numerous studies indicate an oncogenic function for ID1, ID2 and ID3. In contrast, the inhibitor of differentiation 4 (ID4) presents a paradigm shift in context of well-established role of ID1, ID2 and ID3 in development and cancer. Apart from some degree of functional redundancy such as HLH dependent interactions with bHLH protein E2A, many of the functions of ID4 are distinct from ID1, ID2 and ID3: ID4 proteins a) regulate distinct developmental processes and tissue expression in the adult, b) promote stem cell survival, differentiation and/or timing of differentiation, c) epigenetic inactivation/loss of expression in several advanced stage cancers and d) increased expression in some cancers such as those arising in the breast and ovary. Thus, in spite of sharing the conserved HLH domain, ID4 defies the established model of ID protein function and expression. The underlying molecular mechanism responsible for the unique role of ID4 as compared to other ID proteins still remains largely un-explored. This review will focus on the current understanding of ID4 in context of development and cancer.",

Under normal conditions, PI3K/AKT activation is tightly controlled and dependent on both extracellular growth signals and the availability of amino acids and glucose. Genetic aberrations leading to PI3K/AKT hyper-activation are observed at considerable frequency in all major nodes in most tumors. In colorectal cancer the most commonly observed pathway changes are IGF2 overexpression, PIK3CA mutations and PTEN mutations and deletions. Combined, these alterations are found in about 40% of large bowel tumors. In addition, but not mutually exclusive to these, KRAS mutations are observed at a similar frequency. There are however additional, less frequent and more poorly understood events that may also push the PI3K/AKT pathway into overdrive and thus promote malignant growth. Here we discuss aberrations of components at the genetic, epigenetic, transcriptional, post-transcriptional, translational and post-translational level where perturbations may drive excessive PI3K/AKT signaling. Integrating multiple molecular levels will advance our understanding of this cancer critical circuit and more importantly, improve our ability to pharmacologically target the pathway in view of clonal development, tumor heterogeneity and drug resistance mechanisms. In this review, we revisit the PI3K/AKT pathway cancer susceptibility syndromes, summarize the known aberrations at the different regulatory levels and the prognostic and predictive values of these alterations in colorectal cancer.",

They also cause D-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria and Ollier and Maffucci syndromes. IDH1/2 mutations are associated with prolonged survival in glioma and in ICC, but not in AML. The reason for this is unknown. In their wild-type forms, IDH1 and IDH2 convert isocitrate and NADP+ to \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG) and NADPH. Missense mutations in the active sites of these enzymes induce a neo-enzymatic reaction wherein NADPH reduces \u03b1KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG). The resulting D-2HG accumulation leads to hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 degradation, and changes in epigenetics and extracellular matrix homeostasis. Such mutations also imply less NADPH production capacity. Each of these effects could play a role in cancer formation. Here, we provide an overview of the literature and discuss which downstream molecular effects are likely to be the drivers of the oncogenic and survival-prolonging properties of IDH1/2 mutations. We discuss interactions between mutant IDH1/2 inhibitors and conventional therapies.

Two distinct ubiquitination systems have been reported to regulate AKT signaling: K63-linked ubiquitination, which promotes the oncogenic activation of AKT, and K48-linked ubiquitination, which triggers the proteasomal degradation of phosphorylated AKT. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for the gross disposal and recycling of intracellular proteins in mammalian cells.

An increasing number of reports demonstrate that aberrant lysine methylation plays a central role in carcinogenesis that is often correlated with abnormal expression of PKMTs. Recent whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing projects have also discovered several somatic mutations in PKMTs that frequently appear in various tumors. These include chromosomal translocations that lead to aberrant expression or mistargeting of PKMTs and nonsense or frameshift mutations, which cause the loss of the protein function. Another type of mutations are missense mutations which may lead to the loss of enzyme activity, but may also alter the properties of PKMTs either by changing the product or substrate specificity or by increasing the enzymatic activity finally leading to a gain-of-function phenotype. In this review, we provide an overview of the roles of EZH2, SETD2, NSD family, SMYD family, MLL family and DOT1L PKMTs in cancer focusing on the effects of somatic cancer mutations in these enzymes. Investigation of the effect of somatic cancer mutations in PKMTs is pivotal to understand the general role of this important class of enzymes in carcinogenesis and to improve and develop more individualized cancer therapies.",

Of these the best characterised is TBX2, whose expression is upregulated in cancers including breast, pancreatic, ovarian, liver, endometrial adenocarcinoma, glioblastomas, gastric, uterine cervical and melanoma. Understanding the role and regulation of TBX2, as well as other T-box factors, in contributing directly to tumour progression, and especially in suppression of senescence and control of invasiveness suggests that targeting TBX2 expression or function alone or in combination with currently available chemotherapeutic agents may represent a therapeutic strategy for cancer.",

PEITC targets multiple proteins to suppress various cancer-promoting mechanisms such as cell proliferation, progression and metastasis. Pre-clinical evidence suggests that combination of PEITC with conventional anti-cancer agents is also highly effective in improving overall efficacy.

     "abstract": "MYC is one of the most frequently deregulated oncogenes in human malignancies. It encodes a leucine zipper transcription factor that modulates a broad spectrum of cellular genes responsible for enhancing cell proliferation, cellular metabolism, growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, genomic instability, stem cell self-renewal and reduced differentiation. MYC functions predominantly as an amplifier of expression of already active genes, potentiating the pre-existing transcriptional program, although it can also repress certain transcriptional targets. In mouse models, MYC induces lymphomas, but requires cooperation with other lesions, including inactivation of the p53 pathway, structural alterations of BCL2 family members, or increased PI3K activity. In human B-cell tumors, MYC rearrangements involving the 8q24 region and immunoglobulin heavy or light genes are a hallmark of Burkitt lymphoma (BL), but can also occur in other lymphoid malignancies, that include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (BCLU), plasma cell myeloma (PCM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) and plasmablastic lymphoma. For non-BL lymphoid malignancies, MYC fusions represent secondary genetic events and exist in the context of complex karyotypes. Regardless of the mechanism deregulating MYC, lymphomas over-expressing MYC are addicted to this oncogene, highlighting the potential clinical utility of MYC targeting strategies. Several promising approaches for pharmaceutical intervention have been suggested which are now in preclinical or clinical development. Herein, we therefore review the molecular pathogenetic mechanisms associated with MYC deregulation in human B-cell lymphomas and their implications for therapies targeting MYC.",

Familial thyroid cancer has become a well-recognized, unique, clinical entity in patients with thyroid cancer originating from follicular cells, that is, nonmedullary thyroid carcinoma. Hereditary nonmedullary thyroid cancer may occur as a minor component of familial cancer syndromes (familial adenomatous polyposis, Gardner's syndrome, Cowden's disease, Carney's complex type 1, Werner's syndrome, and papillary renal neoplasia) or as a primary feature (familial nonmedullary thyroid cancer [FNMTC]).Although there is some controversy, some epidemiologic and clinical kindred studies have shown that FNMTC is associated with more aggressive disease than sporadic cases, with higher rates of multicentric tumours, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal invasion, and shorter disease-free survival. This way, preventing screening will allow earlier detection, more timely intervention, and hopefully improved outcomes for patients and their families. On the other hand, in the last years, an important number of genetic studies on FNMTC have been published, trying to determine its genetic contribution. However, the genetic inheritance of FNMTC remains unclear; but it is believed to be autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. This paper provides an extensive overview of FNMTC from several points of view. Firstly, the impact of early detection on prognosis, secondly, the management and follow-up of FNMTC patients, and finally, the role of susceptibility loci, microRNAs (miRNAs) and telomerases in recently identified isolated cases of FNMTC.",

Therefore, alternative additional therapies are required. The etiology of ovarian cancer remains largely unknown, but risk factors point toward an important role for oxidative stress. Both healthy and tumor cells can cope with oxidative stress by activating the transcription factor Nrf2 (also known as Nfe2l2), the master regulator of antioxidant and cytoprotective genes. Indeed, for most ovarian cancers, aberrant activation of Nrf2 is observed, which is often associated with a copy number loss within the Nrf2-inhibitory complex KEAP1\u2013CUL3\u2013RBX1. A key role for Nrf2 in ovarian carcinogenesis has been validated by siRNA studies. However, to exploit the Nrf2 pathway for therapeutic interventions, potential side-effects should be minimized. In this review, we explore ovarian cancer specific factors with links to aberrant activity of Nrf2, to be exploited in future combination strategies, synergistic with direct Nrf2 inhibitory drugs. Particularly, we propose to stratify patients based on common ovarian cancer mutations (KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2, BRCA1 and its link with estradiol, TP53) for future NRF2 targeting strategies.",

Glioma cells recruit GAMs and MDSCs to the tumour site and block their maturation. Glioma cell-derived factors subsequently skew these cells towards an immunosuppressive, tumour-promoting phenotype. Finally, GAMs and MDSCs enhance immune suppression in the glioma microenvironment and promote glioma growth, invasiveness, and neovascularization. The local and distant cross-talk between glioma cells and GAMs and MDSCs is regulated by a plethora of soluble proteins and cell surface-bound factors, and possibly via extracellular vesicles and platelets.

Loss\u2010of\u2010function mutations in PINK1 were discovered subsequently to cause autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease. Substantial work during the past decade has revealed that PINK1 regulates several primary cellular processes of significance in cancer cell biology, including cell survival, stress resistance, mitochondrial homeostasis and the cell cycle. Mechanistically, PINK1 has been shown to interact on a number of levels with the pivotal oncogenic PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR signalling axis and to control critical mitochondrial and metabolic functions that regulate cancer survival, growth, stress resistance and the cell cycle. A cytoprotective and chemoresistant function for PINK1 has been highlighted by some studies, supporting PINK1 as a target in cancer therapeutics. This article reviews the function of PINK1 in cancer cell biology, with an emphasis on the mechanisms by which PINK1 interacts with PI3-kinase/Akt signalling, mitochondrial homeostasis, and the potential context-dependent pro- and anti-tumorigenic functions of PINK1.",

There are many inherent differences between the cytoskeletal networks of malignant and normal cells, providing an ideal target to attain preferential damage. Further, numerous microfilament-directed agents, and an intermediate filament-directed agent of particular interest (withaferin A) have demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy, suggesting that cytoskeletal filaments may be exploited to supplement chemotherapeutic approaches currently used in the clinical setting. Therefore, this review is intended to expose academics and clinicians to the tremendous variety of cytoskeletal filament-directed agents that are currently available for further chemotherapeutic evaluation. The mechanisms by which microfilament directed- and intermediate filament-directed agents damage malignant cells are discussed in detail in order to establish how the drugs can be used in combination with each other, or with currently approved chemotherapeutic agents to generate a substantial synergistic attack, potentially establishing a new paradigm of chemotherapeutic agents.",

     "abstract": "We reviewed the anti-cancer effects of DCA, an orphan drug long used as an investigational treatment for various acquired and congenital disorders of mitochondrial intermediary metabolism. Inhibition by DCA of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases and subsequent reactivation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxidative phosphorylation is the common mechanism accounting for the drug's anti-neoplastic effects. At least two fundamental changes in tumor metabolism are induced by DCA that antagonize tumor growth, metastases and survival: the first is the redirection of glucose metabolism from glycolysis to oxidation (reversal of the Warburg effect), leading to inhibition of proliferation and induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis. These effects have been replicated in both human cancer cell lines and in tumor implants of diverse germ line origin. The second fundamental change is the oxidative removal of lactate, via pyruvate, and the co-incident buffering of hydrogen ions by dehydrogenases located in the mitochondrial matrix. Preclinical studies demonstrate that DCA has additive or synergistic effects when used in combination with standard agents designed to modify tumor oxidative stress, vascular remodeling, DNA integrity or immunity. These findings and limited clinical results suggest that potentially fruitful areas for additional clinical trials include 1) adult and pediatric high grade astrocytomas; 2) BRAF-mutant cancers, such as melanoma, perhaps combined with other pro-oxidants; 3) tumors in which resistance to standard platinum-class drugs alone may be overcome with combination therapy; and 4) tumors of endodermal origin, in which extensive experimental research has demonstrated significant anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic effects of DCA, leading to improved host survival.",

     "abstract": "Tumor-associated neovasculature is a critical therapeutic target; however, despite significant progress made in the clinical efficacy of anti-vessel drugs, the effect of these agents remains transient: over time, most patients develop resistance, which inevitably leads to tumor progression. To develop more effective treatments, it is imperative that we better understand the mechanisms involved in tumor vessel formation, how they participate to the tumor progression and metastasis, and the best way to target them.Several mechanisms contribute to the formation of tumor-associated vasculature: i) neoangiogenesis; ii) vascular co-option; iii) mosaicism; iv) vasculogenic mimicry, and v) postnatal vasculogenesis. These mechanisms can also play a role in the development of resistance to anti-angiogenic drugs, and could serve as targets for designing new anti-vascular molecules to treat solid as well as hematological malignancies. Bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cell (EPC)-mediated vasculogenesis represents an important new target, especially at the early stage of tumor growth (when EPCs are critical for promoting the \u201cangiogenic switch\u201d), and during metastasis, when EPCs promote the transition from micro- to macro-metastases. In hematologic malignancies, the EPC population could be related to the neoplastic clone, and both may share a common ontogeny. Thus, characterization of tumor-associated EPCs in blood cancers may provide clues for more specific anti-vascular therapy that has both direct and indirect anti-tumor effects. Here, we review the role of vasculogenesis, mediated by bone marrow-derived EPCs, in the progression of cancer, with a particular focus on the role of these cells in promoting progression of hematological malignancies.",

Since its identification, it has attracted only a limited interest, mainly in the sPLA2 biology field, as it is viewed uniquely as a regulator of sPLA2 activities. Recent discoveries outline novel important functions of this gene in cancer biology. Indeed, PLA2R1 gain or loss of function experiments in vitro and in vivo shows that this receptor promotes several tumor suppressive responses including senescence, apoptosis and inhibition of transformation. Supporting a tumor suppressive role of PLA2R1, its expression decreases in numerous cancers, and known oncogenes such as HIF2\u03b1 and c-MYC repress its expression. PLA2R1 promoter methylation, a classical way to repress tumor suppressive gene expression in cancer cells, is observed in leukemia, in kidney and in breast cancer cells. Mechanistically, PLA2R1 activates the kinase JAK2 and orients its activity towards a tumor suppressive one. PLA2R1 also promotes accumulation of reactive oxygen species which induce cell death and senescence. This review compiles recent data demonstrating an unexpected tumor suppressive role of PLA2R1 and outlines the future work needed to improve our knowledge of the functions of this gene in cancer.",

The generation of immune suppressive cells like myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that can counteract T cell responses represents one such strategy. There is an accumulation of immature myeloid cells or MDSCs in bone marrow (BM) and lymphoid organs under pathological conditions such as cancer. MDSCs represent a population of heterogeneous myeloid cells comprising of macrophages, granulocytes and dendritic cells that are at early stages of development. Although, the precise signaling pathways and molecular mechanisms that lead to MDSC generation and expansion in cancer remains to be elucidated. It is widely believed that perturbation of signaling pathways involved during normal hematopoietic and myeloid development under pathological conditions such as tumorogenesis contributes to the development of suppressive myeloid cells. In this review we discuss the role played by key signaling pathways such as PI3K, Ras, Jak/Stat and TGFb during myeloid development and how their deregulation under pathological conditions can lead to the generation of suppressive myeloid cells or MDSCs. Targeting these pathways should help in elucidating mechanisms that lead to the expansion of MDSCs in cancer and point to methods for eliminating these cells from the tumor microenvironment.",

The present review addresses the biological mechanisms that underlie the diffuse infiltrative phenotype, knowledge of which may improve treatment strategies for this disastrous tumor type. The invasive phenotype is specific for glioma: most other brain tumor types, both primary and metastatic, grow as delineated lesions. Differences between the genetic make-up of glioma and that of other tumor types may therefore help to unravel molecular pathways, involved in diffuse infiltrative growth. One such difference concerns mutations in the NADP+-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2) genes, which occur in >\u00a080% of cases of low grade glioma and secondary glioblastoma.

They are important mediators of intercellular communication and regulators of the cellular niche, and their altered characteristics in many diseases, such as cancer, suggest them to be important both for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, prompting the idea of using exosomes as drug delivery vehicles, especially for gene therapy. This review covers the current status of evidence presented in the field of exosome-based drug delivery systems. Components for successful exosome-based drug delivery, such as choice of donor cell, therapeutic cargo, use of targeting peptide, loading method and administration route are highlighted and discussed with a general focus pertaining to the results obtained in models of different cancer types. In addition, completed and on-going clinical trials are described, evaluating exosome-based therapies for the treatment of different cancer types. Due to their endogenous origin, exosome-based drug delivery systems may have advantages in the treatment of cancer, but their design needs further refinement to justify their usage on the clinical scale.",

     "abstract": "The inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) plays a vital role in the progression of human cancers. Nevertheless, those ubiquitous TSGs have been shown with limited roles in various stages of diverse carcinogenesis. Investigation on identifying unique TSG, especially for early stage of carcinogenesis, is imperative. As such, the search for organ-specific TSGs has emerged as a major strategy in cancer research. Prostate cancer (PCa) has the highest incidence in solid tumors in US males. Cellular prostatic acid phosphatase (cPAcP) is a prostate-specific differentiation antigen. Despite intensive studies over the past several decades on PAcP as a PCa biomarker, the role of cPAcP as a PCa-specific tumor suppressor has only recently been emerged and validated. The mechanism underlying the pivotal role of cPAcP as a prostate-specific TSG is, in part, due to its function as a protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) as well as a phosphoinositide phosphatase (PIP), an apparent functional homologue to phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in PCa cells. This review is focused on discussing the function of this authentic prostate-specific tumor suppressor and the mechanism behind the loss of cPAcP expression leading to prostate carcinogenesis. We review other phosphatases' roles as TSGs which regulate oncogenic PI3K signaling in PCa and discuss the functional similarity between cPAcP and PTEN in prostate carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is one of the most widely used tumor markers, and strongly correlates with the risk of harboring from prostate cancer (PCa). This risk is visible already several years in advance but PSA has severe limitations for PCa detection with its low specificity and low negative predictive value. There is an urgent need for new biomarkers especially to detect clinically significant and aggressive PCa. From all PSA-based markers, the FDA-approved Prostate Health Index (phi) shows improved specificity over percent free and total PSA. Other serum kallikreins or sarcosine in serum or urine show more diverging data. In urine, the FDA-approved prostate cancer gene 3 (PCA3) has also proven its utility in the detection and management of early PCa. However, some aspects on its correlation with aggressiveness and the low sensitivity at very high values have to be re-examined. The detection of a fusion of the androgen regulated TMPRSS2 gene with the ERG oncogene (from the ETS family), which acts as transcription factor gene, in tissue of ~\u00a050% of all PCa patients was one milestone in PCa research. When combining the urinary assays for TMPRSS2:ERG and PCA3, an improved accuracy for PCa detection is visible. PCA3 and phi as the best available PCa biomarkers show an equal performance in direct comparisons.",

In this review, we aim to compile the knowledge on radiation sensitivity of immunocompetent cells and to summarize data from bone marrow and peripheral blood cells derived from mouse and human origin. In addition, we address the radiation response of blood stem and progenitor cells. The data indicate that stem cells, T helper cells, cytotoxic T cells, monocytes, neutrophils and, at a high degree, B cells display a radiation sensitive phenotype while regulatory T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells appear to be more radioresistant. No conclusive data are available for basophil and eosinophil granulocytes. Erythrocytes and thrombocytes, but not their precursors, seem to be highly radioresistant. Overall, the data indicate considerable differences in radiosensitivity of bone marrow and blood normal and malignant cell populations, which are discussed in the light of differential radiation responses resulting in hematotoxicity and related clinical implications.",

     "abstract": "Apoptosis is a fundamental process that contributes to tissue homeostasis, immune responses, and development. The receptor CD95, also called Fas, is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNF-R) superfamily. Its cognate ligand, CD95L, is implicated in immune homeostasis and immune surveillance, and various lineages of malignant cells exhibit loss-of-function mutations in this pathway; therefore, CD95 was initially classified as a tumor suppressor gene. However, more recent data indicate that in different pathophysiological contexts, this receptor can transmit non-apoptotic signals, promote inflammation, and contribute to carcinogenesis. A comparison with the initial molecular events of the TNF-R signaling pathway leading to non-apoptotic, apoptotic, and necrotic pathways reveals that CD95 is probably using different molecular mechanisms to transmit its non-apoptotic signals (NF-\u03baB, MAPK, and PI3K). As discussed in this review, the molecular process by which the receptor switches from an apoptotic function to an inflammatory role is unknown. More importantly, the biological functions of these signals remain elusive.",

Chemotherapy is the treatment of cancer with one or combination of cytotoxic or cytostatic drugs. Recent advances in chemotherapy allowed a great number of cancer patients to receive treatment with significant results. Unfortunately, resistance to chemotherapeutic drug treatment is a major challenge for clinicians in the majority of epithelial cancers because it is responsible for the inefficiency of therapies.Mucins belong to a heterogeneous group of large O-glycoproteins that can be either secreted or membrane-bound. Implications of mucins have been described in relation to cancer cell behavior and cell signaling pathways associated with epithelial tumorigenesis. Because of the frequent alteration of the pattern of mucin expression in cancers as well as their structural and functional characteristics, mucins are thought to also be involved in response to therapies. In this report, we review the roles of mucins in chemoresistance and the associated underlying molecular mechanisms (physical barrier, resistance to apoptosis, drug metabolism, cell stemness, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition) and discuss the therapeutic tools/strategies and/or prognosis biomarkers for personalized chemotherapy that could be proposed from these studies.",

     "abstract": "Formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) has been demonstrated to be a basic prerequisite for sustainable growth and proliferation of tumor. Several growth factors, cytokines, small peptides and enzymes support tumor growth either independently or in synergy. Decoding the crucial mechanisms of angiogenesis in physiological and pathological state has remained a subject of intense interest during the past three decades. Currently, the most widely preferred approach for arresting tumor angiogenesis is the blockade of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway; however, the clinical usage of this modality is still limited by several factors such as adverse effects, toxicity, acquired drug resistance, and non-availability of valid biomarkers. Nevertheless, angiogenesis, being a normal physiological process imposes limitations in maneuvering it as therapeutic target for tumor angiogenesis. The present review offers an updated relevant literature describing the role of well-characterized angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), placenta growth factor (PLGF), hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) and angiopoetins (ANGs) in regulating tumor angiogenesis.

     "abstract": "Wilms tumor recapitulates the development of the kidney and represents a unique opportunity to understand the relationship between normal and tumor development. This has been illustrated by the findings that mutations of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway-related WT1, \u03b2-catenin, and WTX together account for about one-third of Wilms tumor cases. While intense efforts are being made to explore the genetic basis of the other two-thirds of tumor cases, it is worth noting that, epigenetic changes, particularly the loss of imprinting of the DNA region encoding the major fetal growth factor IGF2, which results in its biallelic over-expression, are closely associated with the development of many Wilms tumors. Recent investigations also revealed that mutations of Drosha and Dicer, the RNases required for miRNA generation, and Dis3L2, the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonuclease that normally degrades miRNAs and mRNAs, could cause predisposition to Wilms tumors, demonstrating that miRNA can play a pivotal role in Wilms tumor development. Interestingly, Lin28, a direct target of miRNA let-7 and potent regulator of stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, is significantly elevated in some Wilms tumors, and enforced expression of Lin28 during kidney development could induce Wilms tumor. With the success in establishing mice nephroblastoma models through over-expressing IGF2 and deleting WT1, and advances in understanding the ENU-induced rat model, we are now able to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms induced by these genetic, epigenetic, and miRNA alterations in animal models to understand the development of Wilms tumor. These animal models may also serve as valuable systems to assess new treatment targets and strategies for Wilms tumor.",

     "abstract": "WWOX was cloned as a putative tumor suppressor gene mapping to chromosomal fragile site FRA16D. Deletions affecting WWOX accompanied by loss of expression are frequent in various epithelial cancers. Translocations and deletions affecting WWOX are also common in multiple myeloma and are associated with worse prognosis. Metanalysis of gene expression datasets demonstrates that low WWOX expression is significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival in ovarian and breast cancer patients. Although somatic mutations affecting WWOX are not frequent, analysis of TCGA tumor datasets led to identifying 44 novel mutations in various tumor types. The highest frequencies of mutations were found in head and neck cancers and uterine and gastric adenocarcinomas.Mouse models of gene ablation led us to conclude that Wwox does not behave as a highly penetrant, classical tumor suppressor gene since its deletion is not tumorigenic in most models and its role is more likely to be of relevance in tumor progression rather than in initiation. Analysis of signaling pathways associated with WWOX expression confirmed previous in vivo and in vitro observations linking WWOX function with the TGF\u03b2/SMAD and WNT signaling pathways and with specific metabolic processes. Supporting these conclusions recently we demonstrated that indeed WWOX behaves as a modulator of TGF\u03b2/SMAD signaling by binding and sequestering SMAD3 in the cytoplasmic compartment. As a consequence progressive loss of WWOX expression in advanced breast cancer would contribute to the pro-metastatic effects resulting from TGF\u03b2/SMAD3 hyperactive signaling in breast cancer.Recently, GWAS and resequencing studies have linked the WWOX locus with familial dyslipidemias and metabolic syndrome related traits. Indeed, gene expression studies in liver conditional KO mice confirmed an association between WWOX expression and lipid metabolism.Finally, very recently the first human pedigrees with probands carrying homozygous germline loss of function WWOX mutations have been identified. These patients are characterized by severe CNS related pathology that includes epilepsy, ataxia and mental retardation.In summary, WWOX is a highly conserved and tightly regulated gene throughout evolution and when defective or deregulated the consequences are important and deleterious as demonstrated by its association not only with poor prognosis in cancer but also with other important human pathologies such as metabolic syndrome and CNS related pathologic conditions.",

The profound sensitivity of tumors with germline BRCA mutations to PARP1/2 blockade owes to inherent defects of the BRCA-dependent homologous recombination machinery, which are unleashed by interruption of PARP DNA repair activity and lead to DNA damage overload and cell death. Conversely, aspirant BRCA-like tumors harboring somatic DNA repair dysfunctions (a vast entity of genetic and epigenetic defects known as \u201cBRCAness\u201d) not always align with the familial counterpart and appear not to be equally sensitive to PARP inhibition. The acquisition of secondary resistance in initially responsive patients and the lack of standardized biomarkers to identify \u201cBRCAness\u201d pose serious threats to the clinical advance of PARP inhibitors; a feeling is also emerging that a BRCA-centered perspective might have missed the influence of additional, not negligible and DNA repair-independent PARP contributions onto therapy outcome. While regulatory approval for PARP1/2 inhibitors is still pending, novel therapeutic opportunities are sprouting from different branches of the PARP family, although they remain immature for clinical extrapolation. This review is an endeavor to provide a comprehensive appraisal of the multifaceted biology of PARPs and their evolving impact on cancer therapeutics.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells cooperate with stromal cells and use their environment to promote tumor growth. Energy production depends on nutrient availability and O2 concentration. Well-oxygenated cells are highly proliferative and reorient the glucose metabolism towards biosynthesis, whereas glutamine oxidation replenishes the TCA cycle coupled with OXPHOS-ATP production. Glucose, glutamine and alanine transformations sustain nucleotide and fatty acid synthesis. In contrast, hypoxic cells slow down their proliferation, enhance glycolysis to produce ATP and reject lactate which is recycled as fuel by normoxic cells. Thus, glucose is spared for biosynthesis and/or for hypoxic cell function. Environmental cells, such as fibroblasts and adipocytes, serve as food donors for cancer cells, which reject waste products (CO2, H+, ammoniac, polyamines\u2026) promoting EMT, invasion, angiogenesis and proliferation.

     "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant disorder that originates in a single B- or T-lymphocyte progenitor and is characterized by a range of numeric and structural chromosomal aberrations. Although, so far no clear cause can be found for ALL the most commonly recognized and strongest causal factor is infection. However, an interesting question is how viral infection may be responsible for genetic changes that lead to lymphoid cell transformation. A plausible mechanism by which infection might impact the process of leukemogenesis via genetic alteration is through: oxidative stress/DNA damage which is closely linked with inflammation, aberrant expression of AID/ABOBEC family enzymes which may be responsible for massive mutation introduction and alteration of DNA methylation, leading to changes in the expression of hematopoietic genes. In this review we propose several specific molecular mechanisms which link infection with all the above-mentioned processes. The most likely event which links common virus infection with ALL pathogenesis is aberrant expression of AID/APOBEC. This event may be directly responsible for the introduction of point mutations (as the result of cytosine or 5-methylcytosine deamination and formation of G:U or G:T misspairs) as well as changes in DNA methylation status.",

Here we will review current studies from a sialic acid sugar perspective showing that tumor-derived sialic acids disable major killing mechanisms of effector immune cells, trigger production of immune suppressive cytokines and dampen activation of antigen-presenting cells and subsequent induction of anti-tumor immune responses.

The components extracted from neem plant have been used in traditional medicine for the cure of multiple diseases including cancer for centuries. The extracts of seeds, leaves, flowers, and fruits of neem have consistently shown chemopreventive and antitumor effects in different types of cancer. Azadirachtin and nimbolide are among the few bioactive components in neem that have been studied extensively, but research on a great number of additional bioactive components is warranted. The key anticancer effects of neem components on malignant cells include inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of cell death, suppression of cancer angiogenesis, restoration of cellular reduction/oxidation (redox) balance, and enhancement of the host immune responses against tumor cells. While the underlying mechanisms of these effects are mostly unclear, the suppression of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway is, at least partially, involved in the anticancer functions of neem components. Importantly, the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of neem components are tumor selective as the effects on normal cells are significantly weaker. In addition, neem extracts sensitize cancer cells to immunotherapy and radiotherapy, and enhance the efficacy of certain cancer chemotherapeutic agents. This review summarizes the current updates on the anticancer effects of neem components and their possible impact on managing cancer incidence and treatment.",

     "abstract": "PALB2 was first identified as a partner of BRCA2 that mediates its recruitment to sites of DNA damage. PALB2 was subsequently found as a tumor suppressor gene. Inherited heterozygosity for this gene is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the breast and other sites. Additionally, biallelic mutation of PALB2 is linked to Fanconi anemia, which also has an increased risk of developing malignant disease. Recent work has identified numerous interactions of PALB2, suggesting that it functions in a network of proteins encoded by tumor suppressors. Notably, many of these tumor suppressors are related to the cellular response to DNA damage. The recruitment of PALB2 to DNA double-strand breaks at the head of this network is via a ubiquitin-dependent signaling pathway that involves the RAP80, Abraxas and BRCA1 tumor suppressors. Next, PALB2 interacts with BRCA2, which is a tumor suppressor, and with the RAD51 recombinase. These interactions promote DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). More recently, PALB2 has been found to bind the RAD51 paralog, RAD51C, as well as the translesion polymerase pol \u03b7, both of which are tumor suppressors with functions in HR. Further, an interaction with MRG15, which is related to chromatin regulation, may facilitate DNA repair in damaged chromatin. Finally, PALB2 interacts with KEAP1, a regulator of the response to oxidative stress. The PALB2 network appears to mediate the maintenance of genome stability, may explain the association of many of the corresponding genes with similar spectra of tumors, and could present novel therapeutic opportunities.",

These molecules are host genes and/or proteins, and cellular microRNAs involved in cell cycle regulation that result from disturbed expression of HR-HPV E5, E6 and E7 oncoproteins. One of the current challenges in medicine is to discover potent biomarkers that can correctly diagnose cervical premalignant lesions and standardize clinical management. Currently, studies are showing that some of these molecules are potential biomarkers of cervical carcinogenesis, and it is possible to carry out a more accurate diagnosis and provide more appropriate follow-up treatment for women with cervical dysplasia.

There is strong evidence to suggest that aberrant STAT3 signaling promotes initiation and progression of human cancers by either inhibiting apoptosis or inducing cell proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Suppression of STAT3 activation results in the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells, and accordingly its pharmacological modulation by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides, decoy nucleotides, dominant negative proteins, RNA interference and chemopreventive agents have been employed to suppress the proliferation of various human cancer cells in culture and tumorigenicity in vivo.

Iron is a trace element integral to a multitude of metabolic processes, including DNA synthesis and energy transduction. Due to their generally heightened proliferative potential, cancer cells have a greater metabolic demand for iron than normal cells. As such, iron metabolism represents an important \u201cAchilles' heel\u201d for cancer that can be targeted by ligands that bind and sequester intracellular iron. Indeed, novel thiosemicarbazone chelators that act by a \u201cdouble punch\u201d mechanism to both bind intracellular iron and promote redox cycling reactions demonstrate marked potency and selectivity in vitro and in vivo against a range of tumours. The general mechanisms by which iron chelators selectively target tumour cells through the sequestration of intracellular iron fall into the following categories: (1) inhibition of cellular iron uptake/promotion of iron mobilisation; (2) inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase, the rate-limiting, iron-containing enzyme for DNA synthesis; (3) induction of cell cycle arrest; (4) promotion of localised and cytotoxic reactive oxygen species production by copper and iron complexes of thiosemicarbazones (e.g., Triapine\u00ae and Dp44mT); and (5) induction of metastasis and tumour suppressors (e.g., NDRG1 and p53, respectively). Emerging evidence indicates that chelators can further undermine the cancer phenotype via inhibiting the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition that is critical for metastasis and by modulating ER stress.

Dysregulated expression of IAPs is frequently observed in cancers, and the high levels of survivin in tumors compared to normal adult tissues make it an attractive target for pharmacological interventions. The small imidazolium-based compound YM155 has recently been reported to block the expression of survivin via inhibition of the survivin promoter. Recent data, however, question that this is the sole and main effect of this drug, which is already being tested in ongoing clinical studies. Here, we critically review the current data on YM155 and other new experimental agents supposed to antagonize survivin. We summarize how cells from various tumor entities and with differential expression of the tumor suppressor p53 respond to this agent in vitro and as murine xenografts. Additionally, we recapitulate clinical trials conducted with YM155. Our article further considers the potency of YM155 in combination with other anti-cancer agents and epigenetic modulators. We also assess state-of-the-art data on the sometimes very promiscuous molecular mechanisms affected by YM155 in cancer cells.",

Treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) has improved significantly with the advent of agents targeting the mTOR pathway, such as temsirolimus and everolimus. Unfortunately, a number of potential mechanisms that may lead to resistance to mTOR inhibitors have been proposed.In this paper, we discuss the mechanisms underlying resistance to mTOR inhibitors, which include the downstream effectors of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway, the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), the PIM kinase family, PTEN expression, elevated superoxide levels, stimulation of autophagy, immune cell response and ERK/MAPK, Notch and Aurora signaling pathways. Moreover, we present an updated analysis of clinical trials available on PubMed Central and www.clinicaltrials.gov, which were pertinent to the resistance to rapalogs.The new frontier of inhibiting the mTOR pathway is to identify agents targeting the feedback loops and cross talks with other pathways involved in the acquired resistance to mTOR inhibitors. The true goal will be to identify biomarkers predictive of sensitivity or resistance to efficiently develop novel agents with the aim to avoid toxicities and to better choose the active drug for the right patient.",

     "abstract": "Metastasis is a phenomenon of crucial importance in defining prognosis in patients with cancer and is often responsible for cancer-related mortality. It is known that several steps are necessary for clonal cells to disseminate from their primary tumor site and colonize distant tissues, thus originating metastatic lesions. Therefore, investigating the molecular actors regulating this process may provide helpful insights in the development of efficient therapeutic responses. Recent evidences have indicated the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in modulating the metastatic process in solid tumors. miRNAs are small regulatory non-coding RNAs that bind to specific target mRNAs, leading to translational repression. miRNAs are known to act as negative regulators of gene expression and are involved in the regulation of biological processes, including cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis, both in physiological conditions and during diseases, such as tumors. In the specific field of tumorigenesis, miRNAs play an important role in mediating oncogenesis and favoring tumor progression, as a result of their ability to modulate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and other series of events facilitating the formation of metastasis. The role of miRNAs in cancer development has been widely studied and has helped elucidate events such as the change in expression of oncogenes, tumor-suppressors and cancer-related proteins. This review focuses on the mechanisms underlying the role of miRNAs as part of the metastatic process.",

Despite intensive multi-modal treatment, the survival of both OS and ES has not improved much during the last decades and new therapeutic options are awaited. One promising approach is the specific targeting of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) implicated in these types of bone cancer. However, despite encouraging in vitro and in vivo results, apart from intriguing results of Insulin-like Growth Factor-1 Receptor (IGF-1R) antibodies in ES, clinical studies are limited or disappointing. Primary resistance to RTK inhibitors is frequently observed in OS and ES patients, and even patients that initially respond well eventually develop acquired resistance. There are, however, a few remarks to make concerning the current set-up of clinical trials and about strategies to improve RTK-based treatments in OS and ES.This review provides an overview concerning current RTK-mediated therapies in OS and ES and discusses the problems observed in the clinic.

     "abstract": "The Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is a multi-subunit E3 ubiquitin ligase that primarily governs cell cycle progression. APC/C is composed of at least 14 core subunits and recruits its substrates for ubiquitination via one of the two adaptor proteins, Cdc20 or Cdh1, in M or M/early G1 phase, respectively. Furthermore, recent studies have shed light on crucial functions for APC/C in maintaining genomic integrity, neuronal differentiation, cellular metabolism and tumorigenesis. To gain better insight into the in vivo physiological functions of APC/C in regulating various cellular processes, particularly development and tumorigenesis, a number of mouse models of APC/C core subunits, coactivators or inhibitors have been established and characterized. However, due to their essential role in cell cycle regulation, most of the germline knockout mice targeting the APC/C pathway are embryonic lethal, indicating the need for generating conditional knockout mouse models to assess the role in tumorigenesis for each APC/C signaling component in specific tissues. In this review, we will first provide a brief introduction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and the biochemical activities and cellular functions of the APC/C E3 ligase. We will then focus primarily on characterizing genetic mouse models used to understand the physiological roles of each APC/C signaling component in embryogenesis, cell proliferation, development and carcinogenesis. Finally, we discuss future research directions to further elucidate the physiological contributions of APC/C components during tumorigenesis and validate their potentials as a novel class of anti-cancer targets.",

Much is yet to be learned about the role of sequence editing in human biology but this process is a critical modulator of cell regulation and may present an attractive option for therapeutic intervention in cancer in the future.Sequence editing provides an additional regulatory layer of cancer initiation and progression that may be amenable to therapeutic design. Although editing of both RNA and DNA substrates has been known to occur for some time, the extent and implications of these modifications have been grossly underappreciated until recent genome-wide and disease-association studies were reported.

In addition to its primary role as a metastasis suppressor, NDRG1 can also influence other stages of carcinogenesis, namely angiogenesis and primary tumour growth. NDRG1 is regulated by multiple effectors in normal and neoplastic cells, including N-myc, histone acetylation, hypoxia, cellular iron levels and intracellular calcium. Further, studies have found that NDRG1 is up-regulated in neoplastic cells after treatment with novel iron chelators, which are a promising therapy for effective cancer management. Although the pathways by which NDRG1 exerts its functions in cancers have been documented, the relationship between the molecular structure of this protein and its functions remains unclear. In fact, recent studies suggest that, in certain cancers, NDRG1 is post-translationally modified, possibly by the activity of endogenous trypsins, leading to a subsequent alteration in its metastasis suppressor activity.

     "abstract": "Saffron, a spice derived from the flower of Crocus sativus, is rich in carotenoids. Two main natural carotenoids of saffron, crocin and crocetin, are responsible for its color. Preclinical studies have shown that dietary intake of some carotenoids have potent anti-tumor effects both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting their potential preventive and/or therapeutic roles in several tissues. The reports represent that the use of carotenoids without the potential for conversion to vitamin A may provide further protection and avoid toxicity. The mechanisms underlying cancer chemo-preventive activities of carotenoids include modulation of carcinogen metabolism, regulation of cell growth and cell cycle progression, inhibition of cell proliferation, anti-oxidant activity, immune modulation, enhancement of cell differentiation, stimulation of cell-to-cell gap junction communication, apoptosis and retinoid-dependent signaling. Taken together, different hypotheses for the antitumor actions of saffron and its components have been proposed such as a) the inhibitory effect on cellular DNA and RNA synthesis, but not on protein synthesis; b) the inhibitory effect on free radical chain reactions; c) the metabolic conversion of naturally occurring carotenoids to retinoids; d) the interaction of carotenoids with topoisomerase II, an enzyme involved in cellular DNA-protein interaction.

     "abstract": "The introduction of anti-angiogenic drugs especially tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) was a breakthrough in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Although TKIs have significantly improved outcome in patients with metastatic disease, the majority still develop resistance over time. Because different combinations and sequences of TKIs are tested in clinical trials, resistance patterns and mechanisms underlying this phenomenon should be thoroughly investigated. From a clinical point of view, resistance occurs either as a primary phenomenon (intrinsic) or as a secondary phenomenon related to various escape/evasive mechanisms that the tumor develops in response to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition. Intrinsic resistance is less common, and related to the primary redundancy of available angiogenic signals from the tumor, causing unresponsiveness to VEGF-targeted therapies. Acquired resistance in tumors is associated with activation of an angiogenic switch which leads to either upregulation of the existing VEGF pathway or recruitment of alternative factors responsible for tumor revascularization. Multiple mechanisms can be involved in different tumor settings that contribute both to evasive and intrinsic resistance, and current endeavor aims to identify these processes and assess their importance in clinical settings and design of pharmacological strategies that lead to enduring anti-angiogenic therapies.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains an unresolved therapeutic challenge because of its intrinsically refractoriness to both chemo- and radiotherapy due to the complexity of signaling and the activation of survival pathways in cancer cells. Recent studies have demonstrated that the combination of some drugs, targeting most of aberrant pathways crucial for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells may be a valid antitumor strategy for this cancer. Type I interferons (IFNs) may have a role in the pathogenesis and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, but the limit of their clinical use is due to the activation of tumor resistance mechanisms, including JAK-2/STAT-3 pathway. Moreover, aberrant constitutive activation of STAT-3 proteins has been frequently detected in pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The selective targeting of these cell survival cascades could be a promising strategy in order to enhance the antitumor effects of type I IFNs. The activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3), on the other hand, has a suppressive activity on STAT-3. In fact, PPAR-\u03b3 agonists negatively modulate STAT-3 through direct and/or indirect mechanisms in several normal and cancer models. This review provides an overview on the current knowledge about the molecular mechanisms and antitumor activity of these two promising classes of drugs for pancreatic cancer therapy. Finally, the synergistic antiproliferative activity of combined IFN-\u03b2 and troglitazone treatment on pancreatic cancer cell lines, evaluated in vitro, and the consequent potential clinical applications will be discussed.",

In recent years, aberrant expression of SFRPs has been reported to be associated with numerous cancers. As gene expression of SFRP members is often lost through promoter hypermethylation, inhibition of methylation through the use of epigenetic modifying agents could renew the expression of SFRP members and further antagonize deleterious Wnt signaling. Several reports have described epigenetic silencing of these Wnt signaling antagonists in various human cancers, suggesting their possible role as tumor suppressors. SFRP family members thus come across as potential tools in combating Wnt-driven tumorigenesis. However, little is known about SFRP family members and their role in different cancers.

Inhibition of WEE1 is a promising strategy in cancer therapy in combination with DNA-damaging agents, especially when cancer cells harbor p53 mutations, as it causes mitotic catastrophy when DNA is not repaired during G2 arrest. Cancer cell response to WEE1 inhibition monotherapy has also been demonstrated in various types of cancer, including p53 wild-type cancers. We postulate that chromosomal instability can explain tumor response to WEE1 monotherapy. Therefore, chromosomal instability may need to be taken into account when determining the most effective strategy for the use of WEE1 inhibitors in cancer therapy.",

The indefinable borders of glioblastoma cell infiltration into the surrounding healthy tissue prevent complete surgical removal. In addition, genetic mutations, epigenetic modifications and microenvironmental heterogeneity cause resistance to radio- and chemotherapy altogether resulting in a hardly to overcome therapeutic scenario. Therefore, the development of efficient therapeutic strategies to combat these tumors requires a better knowledge of genetic and proteomic alterations as well as the infiltrative behavior of glioblastoma cells and how this can be targeted. Among many cell surface receptors, members of the integrin family are known to regulate glioblastoma cell invasion in concert with extracellular matrix degrading proteases. While preclinical and early clinical trials suggested specific integrin targeting as a promising therapeutic approach, clinical trials failed to deliver improved cure rates up to now. Little is known about glioblastoma cell motility, but switches in invasion modes and adaption to specific microenvironmental cues as a consequence of treatment may maintain tumor cell resistance to therapy. Thus, understanding the molecular basis of integrin and protease function for glioblastoma cell invasion in the context of radiochemotherapy is a pressing issue and may be beneficial for the design of efficient therapeutic approaches. This review article summarizes the latest findings on integrins and extracellular matrix in glioblastoma and adds some perspective thoughts on how this knowledge might be exploited for optimized multimodal therapy approaches.",

In particular small cell lung cancers, which comprise about 15\u201320% of all lung cancers, are extremely aggressive and cure rates are extremely low. Therefore, new treatment modalities are needed and detection at an early stage of disease, as well as adequate monitoring of treatment response is essential in order to improve outcome. In this respect, the use of non-invasive tools for screening and monitoring has gained increasing interest and the clinical applicability of reliable, tumor-related substances that can be detected as tumor markers in easily accessible body fluids is subject of intense investigation. Some of these indicators, such as high LDH levels in serum as a reflection of the disease, have been in use for a long time as a general tumor marker. To allow for improved monitoring of the efficacy of new therapeutic modalities and for accurate subtyping, there is a strong need for specific and sensitive markers that are more directly related to the biology and behavior of small cell lung cancer. In this review the current status of these potential markers, like CEA, NSE, ProGRP, CK-BB, SCC, CgA, NCAM and several cytokeratins will be critically analyzed with respect to their performance in blood based assays. Based on known cleavage sites for cytoplasmic and extracellular proteases, a prediction of stable fragments can be obtained and used for optimal test design. Furthermore, insight into the synthesis of specific splice variants and neo-epitopes resulting from protein modification and cleavage, offers further opportunities for improvement of tumor assays.Finally, we discuss the possibility that detection of SCLC related autoantibodies in paraneoplastic disease can be used as a very early indicator of SCLC.",

Endothelial sprouting angiogenesis is generally considered to be the major mechanism by which new vasculature forms in tumors. However, increasing evidence shows that tumor vasculature is not solely composed of endothelial cells (ECs). Some tumor cells acquire processes similar to embryonic vasculogenesis and produce new vasculature through vasculogenic mimicry, trans-differentiation of tumor cells into tumor ECs, and tumor cell\u2013EC vascular co-option. In addition, tumor cells secrete various vasculogenic factors that induce sprouting angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Vasculogenic tumor cells actively participate in the formation of vascular cancer stem cell niche and a premetastatic niche. Therefore, tumor cell-mediated neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis are closely associated with tumor progression, cancer metastasis, and poor prognosis. Vasculogenic tumor cells have emerged as key players in tumor neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis and play pivotal roles in tumor progression and cancer metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying tumor cell-mediated vascularity as they relate to tumor progression and cancer metastasis remain unclear. Increasing data have shown that various intrinsic and extrinsic factors activate oncogenes and vasculogenic genes, enhance vasculogenic signaling pathways, and trigger tumor neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis. Collectively, tumor cells are the instigators of neovascularization. Therefore, targeting vasculogenic tumor cells, genes, and signaling pathways will open new avenues for anti-tumor vasculogenic and metastatic drug discovery. Dual targeting of endothelial sprouting angiogenesis and tumor cell-mediated neovascularization and lymphangiogenesis may overcome current clinical problems with anti-angiogenic therapy, resulting in significantly improved anti-angiogenesis and anti-cancer therapies.",

Notch signaling and its crosstalk with many signaling pathways play an important role in breast cancer cell growth, migration, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, as well as cancer stem cell (CSC) self-renewal. Therefore, significant attention has been paid in recent years toward the development of clinically useful antagonists of Notch signaling. Better understanding of the structure, function and regulation of Notch intracellular signaling pathways, as well as its complex crosstalk with other oncogenic signals in breast cancer cells will be essential to ensure rational design and application of new combinatory therapeutic strategies.

Among several cell types that constitute the tumor stroma, the discovery that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) have a strong tropism for tumors has achieved notoriety in recent years. Not only are the BM-MSC recruited, but they can also engraft at tumor sites and transdifferentiate into cells such as activated fibroblasts, perivascular cells and macrophages, which will perform a key role in tumor progression. Whether the BM-MSC and their derived cells promote or suppress the tumor progression is a controversial issue. Recently, it has been proposed that proinflammatory stimuli can be decisive in driving BM-MSC polarization into cells with either tumor-supportive or tumor-repressive phenotypes (MSC1/MSC2).

Although mutations in tumor suppressors and oncogenes encoded by the nuclear genome are known to play a critical role in breast tumorigenesis, the contribution of the mitochondrial genome to this process is unclear. Like the nuclear genome, the mitochondrial genome also encodes proteins critical for mitochondrion functions such as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), which is known to be defective in cancer including breast cancer. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is more susceptible to mutations due to limited repair mechanisms compared to nuclear DNA (nDNA). Thus changes in mitochondrial genes could also contribute to the development of breast cancer. In this review we discuss mtDNA mutations that affect OXPHOS. Continuous acquisition of mtDNA mutations and selection of advantageous mutations ultimately leads to generation of cells that propagate uncontrollably to form tumors. Since irreversible damage to OXPHOS leads to a shift in energy metabolism towards enhanced aerobic glycolysis in most cancers, mutations in mtDNA represent an early event during breast tumorigenesis, and thus may serve as potential biomarkers for early detection and prognosis of breast cancer. Because mtDNA mutations lead to defective OXPHOS, development of agents that target OXPHOS will provide specificity for preventative and therapeutic agents against breast cancer with minimal toxicity.",

Two of the most important trophic factors involved in this process are the oestrogen (E) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) molecular axes. The reciprocal crosstalk that exists between these pathways occurs at transcriptional/post-transcriptional and translational/post-translational levels regulate the expression and activity of genes involved in this process. In a clinical context an important consequence of such crosstalk in the mammary gland is the role which it may play in the aetiology, maintenance and development of breast tumours. Although oestradiol (E2) acting through oestrogen receptors \u03b1 and \u03b2 (ER\u03b1/\u03b2) is important for normal mammary gland function it can also provide a mitogenic drive to ER\u00a0+ breast tumours. Therefore over several years anti-oestrogen therapeutic regimens in the form of selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs \u2014 e.g. tamoxifen), aromatase inhibitors (AI e.g. anastrozole) or selective oestrogen receptor down regulators (SERDs \u2013 e.g. fulvestrant) have been used in an adjuvant setting to control tumour growth. Although initial response is usually encouraging, large cohorts of patients eventually develop resistance to these treatments leading to tumour recurrence and poor prognosis. There are potentially many routes by which breast cancer (BC) cells could escape anti-oestrogen based therapeutic strategies and one of the most studied is the possible growth factor mediated activation of ER(s). Because of this, growth factor modulation of ER activity has been an intensively studied route of molecular crosstalk in the mammary gland. The insulin-like growth factors (IGF-1 and -2) are amongst the most potent mitogens for mammary epithelial cells and there is accumulating evidence that they interact with the E2 axis to regulate mitogenesis, apoptosis, adhesion, migration and differentiation of mammary epithelial cells. Such interactions are bi-directional and E2 has been shown to regulate the expression and activity of IGF axis genes with the general effect of sensitising breast epithelial cells to the actions of IGFs and insulin. In this short review we discuss the evidence for the involvement of crosstalk between the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and oestrogen axes in the mammary gland and comment on the relevance of such studies in the aetiology and treatment of BC.",

     "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved pathway for degradation of cytoplasmic proteins and organelles via lysosome. Proteins coded by the autophagy-related genes (Atgs) are the core molecular machinery in control of autophagy. Among the various biological functions of autophagy identified so far, the link between autophagy and cancer is probably among the most extensively studied and is often viewed as controversial. Autophagy might exert a dual role in cancer development: autophagy can serve as an anti-tumor mechanism, as defective autophagy (e.g., heterozygous knockdown Beclin 1 and Atg7 in mice) promotes the malignant transformation and spontaneous tumors. On the other hand, autophagy functions as a protective or survival mechanism in cancer cells against cellular stress (e.g., nutrient deprivation, hypoxia and DNA damage) and hence promotes tumorigenesis and causes resistance to therapeutic agents. Liver cancer is one of the common cancers with well-established etiological factors including hepatitis virus infection and environmental carcinogens such as aflatoxin and alcohol exposure. In recent years, the involvement of autophagy in liver cancer has been increasingly studied. Here, we aim to provide a systematic review on the close cross-talks between autophagy and liver cancer, and summarize the current status in development of novel liver cancer therapeutic approaches by targeting autophagy. It is believed that understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the autophagy modulation and liver cancer development may provoke the translational studies that ultimately lead to new therapeutic strategies for liver cancer.",

     "abstract": "Robust anaerobic metabolism plays a causative role in the origin of cancer cells; however, the oncogenic metabolic genes, factors, pathways, and networks in genesis of tumor-initiating cells (TICs) have not yet been systematically summarized. In addition, the mechanisms of oncogenic metabolism in the genesis of TICs are enigmatic. In this review, we discussed multiple cancer metabolism-related genes (MRGs) that are overexpressed in TICs and are responsible for inducing pluripotent stem cells. Moreover, we summarized that oncogenic metabolic genes and onco-metabolites induce metabolic reprogramming, which switches normal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to cancer anaerobic metabolism, triggers epigenetic, genetic, and environmental alterations, drives the generation of TICs, and boosts the development of cancer. Importantly, cancer metabolism is controlled by positive and negative metabolic regulators. Positive oncogenic metabolic regulators, including key oncogenic metabolic genes, onco-metabolites, hypoxia, and an acidic environment, promote oncogenic metabolic reprogramming and anaerobic metabolism. However, dysfunction of negative metabolic regulators, including defects in p53, PTEN, and LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathways, enhances cancer metabolism. Loss of the metabolic balance results in oncogenic metabolic reprogramming, genesis of TICs, and tumorigenesis. Collectively, this review provides new insight into the role and mechanism of these oncogenic metabolisms in the genesis of TICs and tumorigenesis. Accordingly, targeting key oncogenic genes, onco-metabolites, pathways, networks, and the acidic cancer microenvironment appears to be an attractive strategy for novel anti-tumor treatment.",

     "abstract": "Resistance to endocrine therapy in breast carcinogenesis due to the redox regulation of the signal transduction system by reactive oxygen species (ROS) is the subject of this review article. Both antiestrogens and aromatase inhibitors are thought to prevent cancer through modulating the estrogen receptor function, but other mechanisms cannot be ruled out as these compounds also block metabolism and redox cycling of estrogen and are free radical scavengers. Endocrine therapeutic agents, such as, tamoxifen and other antiestrogens, and the aromatase inhibitor, exemestane, are capable of producing ROS. Aggressive breast cancer cells have high oxidative stress and chronic treatment with exemestane, fulvestrant or tamoxifen may add additional ROS stress. Breast cancer cells receiving long-term antiestrogen treatment appear to adapt to this increased persistent level of ROS. This, in turn, may lead to the disruption of reversible redox signaling that involves redox-sensitive phosphatases, protein kinases, such as, ERK and AKT, and transcription factors, such as, AP-1, NRF-1 and NF-\u03baB. Thioredoxin modulates the expression of estrogen responsive genes through modulating the production of H2O2 in breast cancer cells. Overexpressing thioredoxine reductase 2 and reducing oxidized thioredoxin restores tamoxifen sensitivity to previously resistant breast cancer cells. In summary, it appears that resistance to endocrine therapy may be mediated, in part, by ROS-mediated dysregulation of both estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent redox-sensitive signaling pathways. Further studies are needed to define the mechanism of action of thioredoxin modifiers, and their effect on the redox regulation that contributes to restoring the antiestrogen-mediated signal transduction system and growth inhibitory action.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetic alterations represent a key cancer hallmark, even in hematologic malignancies (HMs) or blood cancers, whose clinical features display a high inter-individual variability. Evidence accumulated in recent years indicates that inactivating DNA hypermethylation preferentially targets the subset of polycomb group (PcG) genes that are regulators of developmental processes. Conversely, activating DNA hypomethylation targets oncogenic signaling pathway genes, but outcomes of both events lead in the overexpression of oncogenic signaling pathways that contribute to the stem-like state of cancer cells. On the basis of recent evidence from population-based, clinical and experimental studies, we hypothesize that factors associated with risk for developing a HM, such as metabolic syndrome and chronic inflammation, trigger epigenetic mechanisms to increase the transcriptional expression of oncogenes and activate oncogenic signaling pathways. Among others, signaling pathways associated with such risk factors include pro-inflammatory nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB), and mitogenic, growth, and survival Janus kinase (JAK) intracellular non-receptor tyrosine kinase-triggered pathways, which include signaling pathways such as transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), Ras GTPases/mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)/extracellular signal-related kinases (ERKs), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and \u03b2-catenin pathways. Recent findings on epigenetic mechanisms at work in HMs and their importance in the etiology and pathogenesis of these diseases are herein summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the role of epigenetic processes in the determination of biological identity, the consequences for interindividual variability in disease clinical profile, and the potential of epigenetic drugs in HMs are also considered.",

The development of cancer takes place in a multi-step process during which cells acquire a series of mutations that eventually lead to unrestrained cell growth and division, inhibition of cell differentiation, and evasion of cell death. Dysregulation of oncoapoptotic genes, growth factors, receptors and their downstream signaling pathway components represent a central driving force in tumor development. The detailed studies of signal transduction pathways for mechanisms of cell growth and apoptosis have significantly advanced our understanding of human cancers, subsequently leading to more effective treatments. Oral squamous cell carcinoma represents a classic example of multi-stage carcinogenesis. It gradually evolves through transitional precursor lesions from normal epithelium to a full-blown metastatic phenotype. Genetic alterations in many genes encoding crucial proteins, which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and apoptosis, have been implicated in oral cancer. As like other solid tumors, in oral cancer these genes include the ones coding for cell cycle regulators or oncoproteins (e.g. Ras, Myc, cyclins, CDKs, and CKIs), tumor suppressors (e.g. p53 and pRb), pro-survival proteins (e.g. telomerase, growth factors or their receptors), anti-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bcl2 family, IAPs, and NF-kB), pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g. Bax and BH-3 family, Fas, TNF-R, and caspases), and the genes encoding key transcription factors or elements for signal transduction leading to cell growth and apoptosis.

     "abstract": "Epidemiology studies revealed the connection between several types of cancer and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and suggested that T2D is both a symptom and a risk factor of pancreatic cancer. High level of circulating insulin (hyperinsulinemia) in obesity has been implicated in promoting aggressive types of cancers. Insulin resistance, a symptom of T2D, pressures pancreatic \u03b2-cells to increase insulin secretion, leading to hyperinsulinemia, which in turn leads to a gradual loss of functional \u03b2-cell mass, thus indicating a fine balance and interplay between \u03b2-cell function and mass. While the mechanisms of these connections are unclear, the mTORC1-Akt signaling pathway has been implicated in controlling \u03b2-cell function and mass, and in mediating the link of cancer and T2D. However, incomplete understating of how the pathway is regulated and how it integrates body metabolism has hindered its efficacy as a clinical target. The IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1)-Exocyst axis is a growth factor- and nutrient-sensor that couples cell growth and division. Here we discuss how IQGAP1-Exocyst, through differential interactions with Rho-type of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases), acts as a rheostat that modulates the mTORC1-Akt and MAPK signals, and integrates \u03b2-cell function and mass with insulin signaling, thus providing a molecular mechanism for cancer initiation in diabetes.

Activation of TLRs results in opposing outcomes, pro-tumorigenic effects and anti-tumor functions. TLR signaling can inhibit apoptosis and promote chronic inflammation-induced tumorigenesis. TLR activation in tumor cells and immune cells can induce production of cytokines, increase tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance, promote invasion and metastasis, and inhibit immune cell activity resulting in tumor immune escape. In contrast, the engagement of other TLRs directly induces growth inhibition and apoptosis of tumor cells and triggers activation of immune cells enhancing anti-tumor immune responses.

Here, we summarize several recent studies on the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation and demethylation and their related factors, and we discuss the potential of DNA methylation and demethylation patterns to contribute to gene transcription patterns in tumorigenesis.",

The results of many studies have demonstrated that the expression of glucose transporters, especially GLUT1, is increased in a variety of malignancies. GLUT1 overexpression has been found to be associated with tumor progression. It was found that GLUT1 overexpression is associated with poor overall survival in various malignant tumors.",

Monocytes/macrophages have many roles in immune regulation, angiogenesis, and tumor metastasis and invasion. In addition, studies have revealed that these cells are essential to tumor progression. Recently, an accumulation of evidence has indicated that macrophages in distinct regions of tumor masses have distinct origins. For instance, classical monocytes appear to be a major source of macrophages in tumor epithelial, perivascular, and hypoxic regions. In contrast, non-classical monocytes are an important source of macrophages in the tumor perivascular region. During the past century, it has been demonstrated that several chemoattractants can regulate the recruitment of monocytes/macrophages to tumor sites. Despite the importance of monocytes/macrophages in tumor progression, there had been, until recently, no efforts to summarize receptor\u2013ligand pairs between tumor-derived chemokines and corresponding receptors in monocytes in different microenvironments. In this review, we present a cohesive view of the distinct expression patterns of chemokine receptors in two different monocyte subsets (classical and non-classical monocytes) and describe their roles in monocyte/macrophage recruitment into distinct tumor microenvironments.

     "abstract": "Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors critically control cell-fate decisions like cell survival, adaptation and death. These processes are regulated by Ca2\u00a0+ signals arising from the endoplasmic reticulum, which at distinct sites is in close proximity to the mitochondria. These organelles are linked by different mechanisms, including Ca2\u00a0+-transport mechanisms involving the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). The amount of Ca2\u00a0+ transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria determines the susceptibility of cells to apoptotic stimuli. Suppressing the transfer of Ca2\u00a0+ from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria increases the apoptotic resistance of cells and may decrease the cellular responsiveness to apoptotic signaling in response to cellular damage or alterations. This can result in the survival, growth and proliferation of cells with oncogenic features. Clearly, proper maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2\u00a0+ homeostasis and dynamics including its links with the mitochondrial network is essential to detect and eliminate altered cells with oncogenic features through the apoptotic pathway. Proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors exploit the central role of Ca2\u00a0+ signaling by targeting the IP3R. There are an increasing number of reports showing that activation of proto-oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressors directly affects IP3R function and endoplasmic reticulum Ca2\u00a0+ homeostasis, thereby decreasing mitochondrial Ca2\u00a0+ uptake and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization. In this review, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressors identified as IP3R-regulatory proteins and how they affect endoplasmic reticulum Ca2\u00a0+ homeostasis and dynamics.",

LKB1 regulates these crucial cellular responses mainly via AMPK/mTOR signaling. Germ-line mutations in LKB1 are associated with the predisposition of the Peutz\u2013Jeghers syndrome in which patients develop gastrointestinal hamartomas and have an enormously increased risk for developing gastrointestinal, breast and gynecological cancers. In addition, somatic inactivation of LKB1 has been associated with sporadic cancers such as lung cancer. The exact mechanisms of LKB1-mediated tumor suppression remain so far unidentified; however, the inability to activate AMPK and the resulting mTOR hyperactivation has been detected in PJS-associated lesions. Therefore, targeting LKB1 in cancer is now mainly focusing on the activation of AMPK and inactivation of mTOR. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies show encouraging results regarding these approaches, which have even progressed to the initiation of a few clinical trials. In this review, we describe the functions, regulation and downstream signaling of LKB1, and its role in hereditary and sporadic cancers. In addition, we provide an overview of several AMPK activators, mTOR inhibitors and additional mechanisms to target LKB1 signaling, and describe the effect of these compounds on cancer cells.

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men in developed countries. Epidemiological studies have associated high blood-cholesterol levels with an increased risk of PCa, whilst cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) reduce the risk of advanced PCa. Furthermore, normal prostate epithelial cells have an abnormally high cholesterol content, with cholesterol levels increasing further during progression to PCa. In this review, we explore why and how this occurs.Concurrent to this observation, intense efforts have been expended in cardiovascular research to better understand the regulators of cholesterol homeostasis. Here, we apply this knowledge to elucidate the molecular mechanisms driving the accumulation of cholesterol in PCa. For instance, recent evidence from our group and others shows that major signalling players in prostate growth and differentiation, such as androgens and Akt, modulate the key transcriptional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis to enhance cholesterol levels. This includes adjusting central carbon metabolism to sustain greater lipid synthesis. Perturbations in cholesterol homeostasis appear to be maintained even when PCa approaches the advanced, \u2018castration-resistant\u2019 state. Overall, this provides a link between cholesterol accumulation and PCa cell growth. Given there is currently no cure for castration-resistant PCa, could cholesterol metabolism be a novel target for PCa therapy?Overall, this review presents a picture that cholesterol metabolism is important for PCa development: growth-promoting factors stimulate cholesterol accumulation, which in turn presents a possible target for chemotherapy. Consequently, we recommend future investigations, both to better elucidate the mechanisms driving this accumulation and applying it in novel chemotherapeutic strategies.",

Strategies to prevent the occurrence of invasive lesions are required to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with the development of cancer. In theory, application of targeted therapies to pre-invasive lesions will prevent their progression to invasive lesions with full malignant potential. The diagnostic challenge for pathologists is to make interpretative decisions on early detected pre-invasive lesions. Overall, only a small proportion of these pre-invasive lesions will progress to invasive carcinoma and morphological assessment is an imprecise and subjective means to differentiate histologically identical lesions with varying malignant potential.

A way to alter an ecosystem is to affect other species within the environment that are supporting the growth and survival of the species of interest, here the tumor cells; thus, some features of ecological systems could be exploited for cancer therapy.

Although the relative merits of GEM and xenograft pancreatic cancer mouse models are subject to debate, both systems have and will continue to yield essential insights in understanding pancreatic cancer etiology. This information is critical for the development of new methods to screen, treat, and prevent pancreatic cancer.",

     "abstract": "Smad ubiquitin regulatory factors (Smurfs) belong to the HECT- family of E3 ubiquitin ligases and comprise mainly of two members, Smurf1 and Smurf2. Initially, Smurfs have been implicated in determining the competence of cells to respond to TGF-\u03b2/BMP signaling pathway. Nevertheless, the intrinsic catalytic activity has extended the repertoire of Smurf substrates beyond the TGF-\u03b2/BMP super family expanding its realm further to epigenetic modifications of histones governing the chromatin landscape. Through regulation of a large number of proteins in multiple cellular compartments, Smurfs regulate diverse cellular processes, including cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation, differentiation, DNA damage response, maintenance of genomic stability, and metastasis. As the genomic ablation of Smurfs leads to global changes in histone modifications and predisposition to a wide spectrum of tumors, Smurfs are also considered to have a novel tumor suppressor function. This review focuses on regulation network and biological functions of Smurfs in connection with its role in cancer progression. By providing a portrait of their protein targets, we intend to link the substrate specificity of Smurfs with their contribution to tumorigenesis. Since the regulation and biological functions of Smurfs are quite complex, understanding the oncogenic potential of these E3 ubiquitin ligases may facilitate the development of mechanism-based drugs in cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are traditionally described as comprising a spectrum of neoplasms, ranging from low grade typical carcinoids (TCs) via the intermediate grade atypical carcinoids (ACs) to the highly malignant small cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas (LCNECs). Recent data, however, suggests that two categories can be distinguished on basis of molecular and clinical data, i.e. the high grade neuroendocrine (NE) carcinomas and the carcinoid tumors.Bronchial carcinoids and SCLCs may originate from the same pulmonary NE precursor cells, but a precursor lesion has only been observed in association with carcinoids, termed diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia. The occurrence of mixed tumors exclusively comprising high grade NE carcinomas also supports a different carcinogenesis for these two groups. Histopathologically, high grade NE lung tumors are characterized by high mitotic and proliferative indices, while carcinoids are defined by maximally 10 mitoses per 2\u00a0mm2 (10 high-power fields) and rarely have Ki67-proliferative indices over 10%. High grade NE carcinomas are chemosensitive tumors, although they usually relapse. Surgery is often not an option due to extensive disease at presentation and early metastasis, especially in SCLC. Conversely, carcinoids are often insensitive to chemo- and radiation therapy, but cure can usually be achieved by surgery.A meta-analysis of comparative genomic hybridization studies performed for this review, as well as gene expression profiling data indicates separate clustering of carcinoids and carcinomas. Chromosomal aberrations are much more frequent in carcinomas, except for deletion of 11q, which is involved in the whole spectrum of NE lung tumors. Deletions of chromosome 3p are rare in carcinoids but are a hallmark of the high grade pulmonary NE carcinomas. On the contrary, mutations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) gene are restricted to carcinoid tumors.Many of the differences between carcinoids and high grade lung NETs can be ascribed to tobacco consumption, which is strongly linked to the occurrence of high grade NE carcinomas. Smoking causes p53 mutations, very frequently present in SCLCs and LCNECs, but rarely in carcinoids. It further results in other early genetic events in SCLCs and LCNECs, such as 3p and 17p deletions. Smoking induces downregulation of E-cadherin and associated epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Also, high grade lung NETs display higher frequencies of aberrations of the Rb pathway, and of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic routes. Carcinoid biology on the other hand is not depending on cigarette smoke intake but rather characterized by aberrations of other specific genetic events, probably including Menin or its targets and interaction partners. This results in a gradual evolution, most likely from proliferating pulmonary NE cells via hyperplasia and tumorlets towards classical carcinoid tumors.We conclude that carcinoids and high grade NE lung carcinomas are separate biological entities and do not comprise one spectrum of pulmonary NETs. This implies the need to reconsider both diagnostic as well as therapeutic approaches for these different groups of malignancies.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxia is one of the fundamental biological phenomena that are intricately associated with the development and aggressiveness of a variety of solid tumors. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) function as a master transcription factor, which regulates hypoxia responsive genes and has been recognized to play critical roles in tumor invasion, metastasis, and chemo-radiation resistance, and contributes to increased cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis and metastasis. Therefore, tumor hypoxia with deregulated expression of HIF and its biological consequence lead to poor prognosis of patients diagnosed with solid tumors, resulting in higher mortality, suggesting that understanding of the molecular relationship of hypoxia with other cellular features of tumor aggressiveness would be invaluable for developing newer targeted therapy for solid tumors. It has been well recognized that cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotypic cells are associated with therapeutic resistance and contribute to aggressive tumor growth, invasion, metastasis and believed to be the cause of tumor recurrence. Interestingly, hypoxia and HIF signaling pathway are known to play an important role in the regulation and sustenance of CSCs and EMT phenotype. However, the molecular relationship between HIF signaling pathway with the biology of CSCs and EMT remains unclear although NF-\u03baB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, Notch, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, and Hedgehog signaling pathways have been recognized as important regulators of CSCs and EMT. In this article, we will discuss the state of our knowledge on the role of HIF-hypoxia signaling pathway and its kinship with CSCs and EMT within the tumor microenvironment. We will also discuss the potential role of hypoxia-induced microRNAs (miRNAs) in tumor development and aggressiveness, and finally discuss the potential effects of nutraceuticals on the biology of CSCs and EMT in the context of tumor hypoxia.",

Despite current advances in multimodality therapies, such as surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, the outcome for patients with high grade glioma remains fatal. The knowledge of how glioma cells develop and depend on the tumor environment might open opportunities for new therapies. There is now a growing awareness that the main limitations in understanding and successfully treating GBM might be bypassed by the identification of a distinct cell type that has defining properties of somatic stem cells, as well as cancer-initiating capacity \u2014 brain tumor stem cells, which could represent a therapeutic target. In addition, experimental studies have demonstrated that the combination of antiangiogenic therapy, based on the disruption of tumor blood vessels, with conventional chemotherapy generates encouraging results. Emerging reports have also shown that microglial cells can be used as therapeutic vectors to transport genes and/or substances to the tumor site, which opens up new perspectives for the development of GBM therapies targeting microglial cells. Finally, recent studies have shown that natural toxins can be conjugated to drugs that bind to overexpressed receptors in cancer cells, generating targeted-toxins to selectively kill cancer cells. These targeted-toxins are highly effective against radiation- and chemotherapy-resistant cancer cells, making them good candidates for clinical trials in GBM patients. In this review, we discuss recent studies that reveal new possibilities of GBM treatment taking into account cancer stem cells, angiogenesis, microglial cells and drug delivery in the development of new targeted-therapies.",

CTC may overcome the limitation of the current available tumor markers, CA19-9. As a surrogate for \u2018real-time biopsy\u2019, CTCs allow recurrent assessment of a tumor's biological activity. We review the current methodologies for CTC extraction and characterization including antibody-based immunological assays, PCR-based assays, and novel technologies based on the physical or biological characteristics of CTCs. CTCs also provide an accessible link to the existence of epithelial to mesenchymal transition, tumor stem cell markers, and ongoing clonal mutations and epigenetic changes in the tumor. We also explore the potential of using CTC profiling in diagnosis, selection of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, detection of recurrent disease, examination of pharmacodynamic biomarkers, as well as in gene therapy and immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer. Ongoing CTC characterization not only has the potential to represent all cells shed from primary pancreatic tumor and each metastatic site, but also allows dynamic sampling at multiple time points during the clinical course to identify the subpopulations of CTCs and the specific molecules driving metastasis and chemo resistance. We predict that CTC genotyping and phenotyping will play an increasing role in personalized therapy and in identification of novel therapeutic targets as well as monitoring the course and status of the disease.",

Traditionally they are divided in myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), a rare population of circulating cells that selectively express Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and TLR9 and have the capacity to produce large amounts of type I interferons (IFNs) in response to pathogenic agents or danger signals. It has been demonstrated that pDCs can coordinate events during the course of viral infections, allergic and autoimmune diseases and cancer. Through the production of type I IFNs, pDCs initiate protective immunity by activating classical DCs, T cells, natural killer cells and B cells. Upon activation, pDCs also differentiate into mature DCs and may contribute to the contraction of T-cell response. Human pDCs preferentially express immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7; LILRA4), which couples with a signaling adapter to activate a prominent immune-receptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated signaling pathway. The interaction between ILT7 and bone marrow stromal cell antigen 2 (BST2, CD317) assures an appropriate TLR response by pDCs during viral infections and likely participates in pDCs tumor crosstalk. Moreover these cells seem to play a crucial role in the initiation of the pathological process of autoimmune diseases such as lupus or psoriasis. Despite the fact that their function within a tumor context is still controversial they represent an attractive target for therapeutic manipulation of the immune system to elicit a powerful immune response against tumor antigens in combination with other therapies.",

     "abstract": "Since the discovery of vitamin C, the number of its known biological functions is continually expanding. Both the names ascorbic acid and vitamin C reflect its antiscorbutic properties due to its role in the synthesis of collagen in connective tissues. Ascorbate acts as an electron-donor keeping iron in the ferrous state thereby maintaining the full activity of collagen hydroxylases; parallel reactions with a variety of dioxygenases affect the expression of a wide array of genes, for example via the HIF system, as well as via the epigenetic landscape of cells and tissues. In fact, all known physiological and biochemical functions of ascorbate are due to its action as an electron donor. The ability to donate one or two electrons makes AscH\u2212 an excellent reducing agent and antioxidant. Ascorbate readily undergoes pH-dependent autoxidation producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). In the presence of catalytic metals this oxidation is accelerated. In this review, we show that the chemical and biochemical nature of ascorbate contribute to its antioxidant as well as its prooxidant properties. Recent pharmacokinetic data indicate that intravenous (i.v.) administration of ascorbate bypasses the tight control of the gut producing highly elevated plasma levels; ascorbate at very high levels can act as prodrug to deliver a significant flux of H2O2 to tumors. This new knowledge has rekindled interest and spurred new research into the clinical potential of pharmacological ascorbate. Knowledge and understanding of the mechanisms of action of pharmacological ascorbate bring a rationale to its use to treat disease especially the use of i.v. delivery of pharmacological ascorbate as an adjuvant in the treatment of cancer.",

In Ewing tumors, chromosomal translocations affecting ETV1 or ETV4 are an underlying cause of carcinogenesis. Likewise, chromosomal rearrangements of the ETV1, ETV4 or ETV5 gene occur in prostate tumors and are thought to be one of the major driving forces in the genesis of prostate cancer. In addition, these three ETS proteins are implicated in melanomas, breast and other types of cancer. Complex posttranslational modifications govern the activity of PEA3 factors, which can promote cell proliferation, motility and invasion. Here, we review evidence for a role of ETV1, 4 and 5 as oncoproteins and describe modes of their action. Modulation of their activation or interaction with cofactors as well as inhibiting crucial target gene products may ultimately be exploited to treat various cancers that are dependent on the PEA3 group of ETS transcription factors.",

Besides its location in the ER, GRP78 has been found to be present in cell plasma membrane, cytoplasm, mitochondria, nucleus as well as cellular secretions. GRP78 is implicated in tumor cell proliferation, apoptosis resistance, immune escape, metastasis and angiogenesis, and its elevated expression usually correlates with a variety of tumor microenvironmental stresses, including hypoxia, glucose deprivation, lactic acidosis and inflammatory response. GRP78 protein acts as a centrally located sensor of stress, which feels and adapts to the alteration in the tumor microenvironment. This article reviews the potential contributions of GRP78 to the acquisition of cancer hallmarks based on intervening in stress responses caused by tumor niche alterations. The paper also introduces several potential GRP78 relevant targeted therapies.",

Thus, secretory miRNAs have demonstrated great potential as powerful and non-invasive cancer biomarkers. Herein, we summarize the current progress of secretory miRNAs in different cancer types and analyze the potential mechanisms of miRNA secretion. Then, we discuss the different approaches to miRNA detection in body fluids and the advantages of secretory miRNAs as biomarkers for early cancer diagnosis and the prediction of therapeutic efficacy.

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species, ROS, are beneficially involved in many signaling pathways that control development and maintain cellular homeostasis. In physiological conditions, a tightly regulated redox balance protects cells from injurious ROS activity, but if the balance is altered, it promotes various pathological conditions including cancer. Understanding the duality of ROS as cytotoxic molecules and key mediators in signaling cascades may provide novel opportunities for improved cancer therapy.MAP17 is a small 17-kDa non-glycosylated membrane protein that is overexpressed in many tumors of different origins, including carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis of MAP17 during cancer progression demonstrates that overexpression of the protein strongly correlates with the progression of most types of tumor. Tumor cells that overexpress MAP17 show an increased tumoral phenotype associated with an increase in ROS. However, in non-tumor cells MAP17 increases ROS, resulting in senescence or apoptosis. Therefore, in tumor cells, MAP17 could be a marker for increased oxidative stress and could define new therapeutic approaches. Here, we review the role of MAP17 as a putative oncogene, as well as its role in cancer and anticancer therapies.",

This is likely due to secondary tissue reactions, such as inflammation and neoangiogenesis. The recent development of clinically effective angiogenesis inhibitors has lead to the initiation of research on the combination of PDT with such angiostatic targeted therapies. Preclinical studies in this research field have shown promising results, causing a revival in the field of PDT. This review reports on the current research efforts on PDT and vascular targeted combination therapies. Different combination strategies with angiogenesis inhibition and vascular targeting approaches are discussed. In addition, the concept of increasing PDT selectivity by targeted delivery of photosensitizers is presented.

     "abstract": "Gliomas are the most frequent adult primary brain tumor, and are invariably fatal. The most common diagnosis glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) afflicts 12,500 new patients in the U.S. annually, and has a median survival of approximately one year when treated with the current standard of care. Alkylating agents have long been central in the chemotherapy of GBM and other gliomas. The DNA repair protein O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), the principal human activity that removes cytotoxic O6-alkylguanine adducts from DNA, promotes resistance to anti-glioma alkylators, including temozolomide and BCNU, in GBM cell lines and xenografts. Moreover, MGMT expression assessed by immunohistochemistry, biochemical activity or promoter CpG methylation status is associated with the response of GBM to alkylator-based therapies, providing evidence that MGMT promotes clinical resistance to alkylating agents. These observations suggest a role for MGMT in directing adjuvant therapy of GBM and other gliomas. Promoter methylation status is the most clinically tractable measure of MGMT, and there is considerable enthusiasm for exploring its utility as a marker to assign therapy to individual patients. Here, we provide an overview of the biochemical, genetic and biological characteristics of MGMT as they relate to glioma therapy. We consider current methods to assess MGMT expression and discuss their utility as predictors of treatment response. Particular emphasis is given to promoter methylation status and the methodological and conceptual impediments that limit its use to direct treatment. We conclude by considering approaches that may improve the utility of MGMT methylation status in planning optimal therapies tailored to individual patients.",

The tumour will then be composed of tumourigenic (cancer stem cells) and non-tumourigenic (the side population that constitutes the bulk of the tumour) cells. Characterizing epigenetic landscapes may thus help discriminate aberrant marks (good candidates for tumour detection) from cancer stem cell specific profiles.

Once CMM has metastasized it becomes therapy-resistant and is an inevitably deadly disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that are involved in the initiation and progression of CMM is crucial for overcoming the commonly observed drug resistance as well as developing novel targeted treatment strategies. This molecular knowledge may further lead to the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers for early CMM detection, risk stratification, or prediction of response to therapy, altogether improving the clinical management of this disease. In this review we summarize the currently identified genetic and epigenetic alterations in CMM development. Although the genetic components underlying CMM are clearly emerging, a complete picture of the epigenetic alterations on DNA (DNA methylation), RNA (non-coding RNAs), and protein level (histone modifications, Polycomb group proteins, and chromatin remodeling) and the combinatorial interactions between these events is lacking. More detailed knowledge, however, is accumulating for genetic and epigenetic interactions in the aberrant regulation of the INK4b\u2013ARF\u2013INK4a and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) loci. Importantly, we point out that it is this interplay of genetics and epigenetics that effectively leads to distorted gene expression patterns in CMM.",

Notably, the interplay via the exchange of exosomes between cancer cells and between cancer cells and the tumor stroma may promote the transfer of oncogenes (e.g. \u03b2-catenin, CEA, HER2, Melan-A/Mart-1 and LMP-1) and onco-microRNAs (e.g. let7, miR1, miR15, miR16 and miR375) from one cell to another, leading to the reprogramming of the recipient cells.

     "abstract": "Neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL), also known as oncogene 24p3, uterocalin, siderocalin or lipocalin 2, is a 24\u00a0kDa secreted glycoprotein originally purified from a culture of mouse kidney cells infected with simian virus 40 (SV-40). Subsequent investigations have revealed that it is a member of the lipocalin family of proteins that transport small, hydrophobic ligands. Since then, NGAL expression has been reported in several normal tissues where it serves to provide protection against bacterial infection and modulate oxidative stress. Its expression is also dysregulated in several benign and malignant diseases. Its small size, secreted nature and relative stability have led to it being investigated as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in numerous diseases including inflammation and cancer. Functional studies, conducted primarily on lipocalin 2 (Lcn2), the mouse homologue of human NGAL have revealed that Lcn2 has a strong affinity for iron complexed to both bacterial siderophores (iron-binding proteins) and certain human proteins like norepinephrine. By sequestering iron-laden siderophores, Lcn2 deprives bacteria of a vital nutrient and thus inhibits their growth (bacteriostatic effect). In malignant cells, its proposed functions range from inhibiting apoptosis (in thyroid cancer cells), invasion and angiogenesis (in pancreatic cancer) to increasing proliferation and metastasis (in breast and colon cancer). Ectopic expression of Lcn2 also promotes BCR-ABL induced chronic myelogenous leukemia in murine models. By transporting iron into and out of the cell, NGAL also regulates iron responsive genes. Further, it stabilizes the proteolytic enzyme matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) by forming a complex with it, and thereby prevents its autodegradation. The factors regulating NGAL expression are numerous and range from pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukins, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interferons to vitamins like retinoic acid. The purpose of this review article is to examine the expression, structure, regulation and biological role of NGAL and critically assess its potential as a novel diagnostic and prognostic marker in both benign and malignant human diseases.",

First, it is a highly lethal disease, with a median survival of less than 6\u00a0months and a 5-year survival rate less than 5%. Second, PDA tumor cells are surrounded by an extensive stroma, which accounts for up to 90% of the tumor volume. It is well recognized that stromal microenvironment can accelerate malignant transformation, tumor growth and progression. More importantly, the interaction loop between PDA and its stroma greatly contributes to tumor growth and progression. We propose that the extensive stroma of PDA is closely linked to its poor prognosis. An improved understanding of the mechanisms that contribute to pancreatic tumor growth and progression is therefore urgently needed. Targeting the stroma may thus provide novel prevention, earlier detection and therapeutic options to this deadly malignancy. Accordingly, in this review, we will summarize the mechanism of PDA stroma formation, the role of the stroma in tumor progression and therapy resistance and the potential of stroma-targeted therapeutics strategies.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most common oncogenic diseases in the Western world. Several cancer associated cellular pathways have been identified, in which protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, especially on tyrosine residues, are one of most abundant regulatory mechanisms. The balance between these processes is under tight control by protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). Aberrant activity of oncogenic PTKs is present in a large portion of human cancers. Because of the counteracting role of PTPs on phosphorylation-based activation of signal pathways, it has long been thought that PTPs must act as tumor suppressors. This dogma is now being challenged, with recent evidence showing that dephosphorylation events induced by some PTPs may actually stimulate tumor formation. As such, PTPs might form a novel attractive target for anticancer therapy. In this review, we summarize the action of different PTPs, the consequences of their altered expression in colorectal cancer, and their potential as target for the treatment of this deadly disease.",

     "abstract": "CD95 and its ligand (CD95L) are widely expressed in colorectal tumors, but their role in shaping tumor behavior is unclear. CD95 activation on tumor cells can lead to apoptosis, while CD95L attracts neutrophils, suggesting a function in tumor suppression. However, CD95 can also promote tumorigenesis, at least in part by activating non-apoptotic signaling pathways that stimulate tumor cell proliferation, invasion and survival. In addition, CD95 signaling in stromal cells and tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells has to be taken into account when addressing the function of CD95 and its ligand in colorectal tumor biology. We present a model in which the tumor-suppressing and tumor-promoting activities of CD95/CD95L together determine colorectal tumor behavior. We also discuss how these multiple activities are changing our view of CD95 and CD95L as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of colorectal cancer. We conclude that locking CD95 in apoptosis-mode may be a more promising anti-cancer strategy than simply inhibiting or stimulating CD95.",

     "abstract": "Approximately 15\u201330% of breast cancers over-express the HER2/neu receptor. Historically, over-expression of HER2/neu has been identified using IHC or FISH, both of which are invasive approaches requiring tissue samples. Recent evidence has shown that some tumors identified as \u201cnegative\u201d using these methods can respond to HER2/neu targeted therapy. Shedding of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the receptor into the circulation has led to the development of a serum test of HER2 ECD as an additional approach to probe HER2/neu overexpression. The serum test will be able to monitor the dynamic changes of HER2 status over the course of disease progression. Some studies further suggest that the serum HER2 ECD level and its change may serve as a biomarker to reflect patients' response to therapy. Yet more than 10\u00a0years after the first serum HER2 ECD test was approved by the FDA, serum HER2 testing has yet to be widely used in clinical practice. In this article we will review the progress of the serum HER2 ECD test and discuss some obstacles impeding its incorporation into broad clinical practice. We will also discuss recent improvements in the sensitivity and specificity of the assay that offer some hope for the future of serum HER2 test.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is a frequent and fatal disease. Recent researches on rodent models and human hepatocarcinogenesis contributed to unravel the molecular mechanisms of hepatocellular carcinoma dedifferentiation and progression, and allowed the discovery of several alterations underlying the deregulation of cell cycle and signalling pathways. This review provides an interpretive analysis of the results of these studies. Mounting evidence emphasises the role of up-regulation of RAS/ERK, PI3K/AKT, IKK/NF-kB, WNT, TGF-\u03b2, NOTCH, Hedgehog, and Hippo signalling pathways as well as of aberrant proteasomal activity in hepatocarcinogenesis. Signalling deregulation often occurs in preneoplastic stages of rodent and human hepatocarcinogenesis and progressively increases in carcinomas, being most pronounced in more aggressive tumours. Numerous changes in signalling cascades are involved in the deregulation of carbohydrate, lipid, and methionine metabolism, which play a role in the maintenance of the transformed phenotype. Recent studies on the role of microRNAs in signalling deregulation, and on the interplay between signalling pathways led to crucial achievements in the knowledge of the network of signalling cascades, essential for the development of adjuvant therapies of liver cancer. Furthermore, the analysis of the mechanisms involved in signalling deregulation allowed the identification of numerous putative prognostic markers and novel therapeutic targets of specific hepatocellular carcinoma subtypes associated with different biologic and clinical features. This is of prime importance for the selection of patient subgroups that are most likely to obtain clinical benefit and, hence, for successful development of targeted therapies for liver cancer.",

The current standard of care consists of prostatectomy and radiation therapy, which may often be supplemented with hormonal therapies. Recurrence is common, and many develop metastatic prostate cancer for which chemotherapy is only moderately effective. It is clear that novel therapies are needed for the treatment of the malignant forms of prostate cancer that recur after initial therapies, such as hormone refractory (HRPC) or castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). With advances in understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cancer, we have witnessed unprecedented progress in developing new forms of targeted therapy. Several targeted therapeutic agents have been developed and clinically used for the treatment of solid tumors such as breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and renal cancer. Some of these reagents modulate growth factors and/or their receptors, which are abundant in cancer cells. Other reagents target the downstream signal transduction, survival pathways, and angiogenesis pathways that are abnormally activated in transformed cells or metastatic tumors. We will review current developments in this field, focusing specifically on treatments that can be applied to prostate cancers.

Hence, it is important to determine whether the mitochondrial DNA might be a good, clinically applicable marker of cancer. This review describes hereditary as well as somatic mutations reported in mitochondrial DNA of colorectal cancer cells. We showed here that the entire mitochondrial genome mutational spectra are different in colorectal cancer and non-tumor cells. We also placed the described mutations on the phylogenetic context, which highlighted the recurrent problem of data quality. Therefore, the most important rules for adequately assessing the quality of mitochondrial DNA sequence analysis in cancer have been summarized. As follows from this review, neither the reliable spectrum of mtDNA somatic mutations nor the association between hereditary mutations and colorectal cancer risk have been resolved. This indicates that only high resolution studies on mtDNA variability, followed by a proper data interpretation employing phylogenetic knowledge may finally verify the utility of mtDNA sequence (if any) in clinical practice.",

     "abstract": "Over decades, cancer treatment has been mainly focused on targeting cancer cells and not much attention to host tumor microenvironment. Recent advances suggest that the tumor microenvironment requires in-depth investigation for understanding the interactions between tumor cell biology and immunobiology in order to optimize therapeutic approaches. Tumor microenvironment consists of cancer cells and tumor associated reactive fibroblasts, infiltrating non-cancer cells, secreted soluble factors or molecules, and non-cellular support materials. Tumor associated host immune cells such as Th1, Th2, Th17, regulatory cells, dendritic cells, macrophages, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells are major components of the tumor microenvironment. Accumulating evidence suggests that these tumor associated immune cells may play important roles in cancer development and progression. However, the exact functions of these cells in the tumor microenvironment are poorly understood. In the tumor microenvironment, NF-\u03baB plays an important role in cancer development and progression because this is a major transcription factor which regulates immune functions within the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we will focus our discussion on the immunological contribution of NF-\u03baB in tumor associated host immune cells within the tumor microenvironment. We will also discuss the potential protective role of zinc, a well-known immune response mediator, in the regulation of these immune cells and cancer cells in the tumor microenvironment especially because zinc could be useful for conditioning the tumor microenvironment toward innovative cancer therapy.",

Although highly active in a large fraction of individuals a considerable number of patients show poor response due to either intrinsic or acquired drug resistance. Extensive research in the past identified several taxane resistance-related mechanisms being activated by pathologically altered single gene function. To date, however, a clinically relevant predictive biomarker for taxanes has not been derived yet from this knowledge, most likely due to the manifold of resistance mechanisms that may combine in one tumor, thereby fostering escape from taxane cytotoxicity.Here, we aimed to comprehensively review the current literature on taxane resistance mechanisms in breast cancer. Interestingly, besides altered microtubule physiology we identified the HER2 signaling cascade as a major dominator influencing several routes of cytotoxicity escape, such as cell survival, apoptosis, drug efflux, and drug metabolism. Furthermore, the transcription factor YBX-1, activated by HER2, facilitates a sustaining HER2 signaling feedback loop contributing to the establishment of cellular survival detours.In conclusion, taxane resistance in breast cancer follows a multiplex establishment of drug cytotoxicity escape routes, which may be most efficiently therapeutically targeted by interference with their mutually governing signaling nodes.",

     "abstract": "Significant correlations between obesity and incidence of various cancers have been reported. Obesity, considered a mild inflammatory process, is characterized by a high level of secretion of several cytokines from adipose tissue. These molecules have disparate effects, which could be relevant to cancer development. Among the inflammatory molecules, leptin, mainly produced by adipose tissue and overexpressed with its receptor (Ob-R) in cancer cells is the most studied adipokine. Mutations of leptin or Ob-R genes associated with obesity or cancer are rarely found. However, leptin is an anti-apoptotic molecule in many cell types, and its central roles in obesity-related cancers are based on its pro-angiogenic, pro-inflammatory and mitogenic actions. Notably, these leptin actions are commonly reinforced through entangled crosstalk with multiple oncogenes, cytokines and growth factors. Leptin-induced signals comprise several pathways commonly triggered by many cytokines (i.e., canonical: JAK2/STAT; MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI-3K/AKT1 and, non-canonical signaling pathways: PKC, JNK and p38 MAP kinase). Each of these leptin-induced signals is essential to its biological effects on food intake, energy balance, adiposity, immune and endocrine systems, as well as oncogenesis. This review is mainly focused on the current knowledge of the oncogenic role of leptin in breast cancer. Additionally, leptin pro-angiogenic molecular mechanisms and its potential role in breast cancer stem cells will be reviewed. Strict biunivocal binding-affinity and activation of leptin/Ob-R complex makes it a unique molecular target for prevention and treatment of breast cancer, particularly in obesity contexts.",

In this article we describe the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms governing this transition. In particular we discuss how initiation of EMT is dependent on the mutually exclusive levels of the transmembrane cell to cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin and its transcriptional repressor Snail1 and how Snail1 and other E-cadherin transcriptional repressors drive the EMT process. We focus on several new aspects of Snail1 regulation and propose a model for understanding the initiation and progression of this transition, based on the existence of feed-back mechanisms that limit or amplify the response to extracellular cues.",

Much attention has been devoted to dissecting how the various input pathways trigger p53 activation and how the activity of the p53 protein itself can be modulated by a plethora of co-factors and post-translational modifications. In this review we will focus instead on the multiple configurations of the effector pathways. We will discuss how p53-generated signals are transmitted, amplified, resisted and eventually integrated by downstream gene circuits operating at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational levels. We will also discuss how context-dependent variations in these gene circuits define the cellular response to p53 activation and how they may impact the clinical efficacy of p53-based targeted therapies.",

The genetic susceptibility, endemic environment factors, and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection are believed to be the major etiologic factors of NPC. Once metastasis occurs, the prognosis is very poor. It is urgently needed to develop biomarkers for early clinical diagnosis/prognosis, and novel effective therapies for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In this paper, we systematically reviewed the current progress of miRNA studies in NPC. It has been shown that both host encoded miRNAs and EBV encoded miRNAs play key roles in almost all the steps of epithelia cell carcinogenesis, including epithelial\u2013mesenchymal to stem-like transition, cell growth, migration, invasion, and tumorigenesis. More importantly, some miRNAs could be secreted out and play a role in the microenvironments. The level of sera miRNAs is correlated with the copy numbers of host miRNAs in tumor biopsies. Promising results of gene therapy have been also achieved by lentiviral delivered miRNAs. Taken together, cell free miRNAs would be potential biomarkers of early clinical diagnosis/prognosis; while some miRNAs could be further developed into therapeutic agents in the future.",

Due to its vast implications in tumorigenesis and progression, the Wnt pathway has attracted considerable attention at several molecular levels, also with respect to developing novel cancer therapeutics. Indeed, research in Wnt biology has recently provided numerous clues, and evidence is accumulating that the secreted Wnt antagonist Dickkopf-related protein 3 (Dkk-3) and its regulators may constitute interesting therapeutic targets in the most important human cancers. Based on the currently available literature, we here review the knowledge on the biological role of Dkk-3 as an antagonist of the Wnt signaling pathway, the involvement of Dkk-3 in several stages of tumor development, the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms disrupting DKK3 gene function in cancerous cells, and the potential clinical value of Dkk-3 expression/DKK3 promoter methylation as a biomarker and molecular target in cancer diseases.In conclusion, Dkk-3 rapidly emerges as a key player in human cancer with auspicious tumor suppressive capacities, most of all affecting apoptosis and proliferation. Its gene expression is frequently downregulated by promoter methylation in almost any solid and hematological tumor entity. Clinically, evidence is accumulating of Dkk-3 being both a potential tumor biomarker and effective anti-cancer agent.

Eicosanoid expression levels vary during development and progression of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies.COX-2 is the major COX-isoform responsible for G.I. cancer development/progression. COX-2 expression increases during progression from a normal to cancerous state. Evidence from observational studies has demonstrated that chronic NSAID use reduces the risk of cancer development, while both incidence and risk of death due to G.I. cancers were significantly reduced by daily aspirin intake. A number of randomized controlled trials (APC trial, Prevention of Sporadic Adenomatous Polyps trial, APPROVe trial) have also shown a significant protective effect in patients receiving selective COX-2 inhibitors. However, chronic use of selective COX-2 inhibitors at high doses was associated with increased cardiovascular risk, while NSAIDs have also been associated with increased risk. More recently, downstream effectors of COX-signaling have been investigated in cancer development/progression. PGE2, which binds to both EP and PPAR receptors, is the major prostanoid implicated in the carcinogenesis of G.I. cancers. The role of TXA2 in G.I. cancers has also been examined, although further studies are required to uncover its role in carcinogenesis. Other prostanoids investigated include PGD2 and its metabolite 15d-PGJ2, PGF1\u03b1 and PGI2. Targeting these prostanoids in G.I. cancers has the promise of avoiding cardiovascular toxicity associated with chronic selective COX-2 inhibition, while maintaining anti-tumor reactivity.A progressive sequence from normal to pre-malignant to a malignant state has been identified in G.I. cancers. In this review, we will discuss the role of the COX-derived prostanoids in G.I. cancer development and progression.

Several proteasome inhibitors that target the proteolytic active sites of the 26S proteasome complex have been developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. These proteasome inhibitors have displayed impressive anti-tumor functions by inducing apoptosis in different tumor types. Further, the proteasome inhibitors have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, and inhibit angiogenesis, cell\u2013cell adhesion, cell migration, immune and inflammatory responses, and DNA repair response. A number of proteasome inhibitors are now in clinical trials to treat multiple myeloma and solid tumors. Many other proteasome inhibitors with different efficiencies are being developed and tested for anti-tumor activities. Several proteasome inhibitors currently in clinical trials have shown significantly improved anti-tumor activities when combined with other drugs such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, Akt (protein kinase B) inhibitors, DNA damaging agents, Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibitors, and lenalidomide. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib is now in the clinic to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Here, we discuss the 26S proteasome complex in carcinogenesis and different proteasome inhibitors with their potential therapeutic applications in treatment of numerous cancers.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, attention has focused on the biology and potential clinical importance of the CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) in colorectal cancer (CRC). While it is generally well accepted that etiologically and clinically distinct subgroups exist in this disease, a precise definition of CIMP remains to be established. Here, we summarize existing literature that documents the prevalence of CIMP in CRC, with particular attention to the various methods and definitions used to classify a tumor as CIMP positive. Through a systematic review on both case-series and population based studies, we examined only original research articles reporting on sporadic CRC and/or adenomas in unselected cases. Forty-eight papers published between January 1999 and August 2011 met the inclusion criteria. We describe the use of multiple gene panels, marker threshold values, and laboratory techniques which results in a wide range in the prevalence of CIMP. Because there is no universal standard or consensus on quantifying the phenotype, establishing its true prevalence is a challenge. This bottleneck is becoming increasingly evident as molecular pathological epidemiology continues to offer possibilities for clear answers regarding environmental risk factors and disease trends. For the first time, large, unselected series of cases are available for analysis, but comparing populations and pooling data will remain a challenge unless a universal definition of CIMP and a consensus on analysis can be reached, and the primary cause of CIMP identified.",

Furthermore, the high cost of antiangiogenic therapies makes it important to avoid utilizing them in the setting of lack of response or developing evasion, making the identification of biomarkers even more important. A number of potential physiologic, circulating, tissue, and imaging biomarkers have emerged from recently completed preclinical animal studies and clinical trials.

This cycle allows cancer cells to burn their host's lipid and protein reserves in order to sustain their own biosynthesis pathways.

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation may increase the risk to develop cancer, for instance esophagitis or gastritis may lead to development of esophageal or gastric cancer, respectively. The key molecules attracting leukocytes to local inflammatory sites are chemokines. We here provide a systematic review on the impact of CXC chemokines (binding the receptors CXCR1, CXCR2, CXCR3 and CXCR4) on the transition of chronic inflammation in the upper gastrointestinal tract to neoplasia. CXCR2 ligands, including GRO-\u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3/CXCL1,2,3, ENA-78/CXCL5 and IL-8/CXCL8 chemoattract pro-tumoral neutrophils. In addition, angiogenic CXCR2 ligands stimulate the formation of new blood vessels, facilitating tumor progression. The CXCR4 ligand SDF-1/CXCL12 also promotes tumor development by stimulating angiogenesis and by favoring metastasis of CXCR4-positive tumor cells to distant organs producing SDF-1/CXCL12. Furthermore, these angiogenic chemokines also directly enhance tumor cell survival and proliferation. In contrast, the CXCR3 ligands Mig/CXCL9, IP-10/CXCL10 and I-TAC/CXCL11 are angiostatic and attract anti-tumoral T lymphocytes and may therefore mediate tumor growth retardation and regression. Thus, chemokines exert diverging, sometimes dual roles in tumor biology as described for esophageal and gastric cancer. Therefore extensive research is needed to completely unravel the complex chemokine code in specific cancers. Possibly, chemokine-targeted cancer therapy will have to be adapted to the individual's chemokine profile.",

     "abstract": "Heat shock proteins (HSP) are a family of proteins induced in cells exposed to different insults. This induction of HSPs allows cells to survive stress conditions. Mammalian HSPs have been classified into six families according to their molecular size: HSP100, HSP90, HSP70, HSP60, HSP40 and small HSPs (15 to 30\u00a0kDa) including HSP27. These proteins act as molecular chaperones either helping in the refolding of misfolded proteins or assisting in their elimination if they become irreversibly damaged. In recent years, proteomic studies have characterized several different HSPs in various tumor types which may be putative clinical biomarkers or molecular targets for cancer therapy. This has led to the development of a series of molecules capable of inhibiting HSPs. Numerous studies speculated that over-expression of HSP is in part responsible for resistance to many anti-tumor agents and chemotherapeutics. Hence, from a pharmacological point of view, the co-administration of HSP inhibitors together with other anti-tumor agents is of major importance in overcoming therapeutic resistance. In this review, we provide an overview of the current status of HSPs in autoimmune, cardiovascular, and neurodegenerative diseases with special emphasis on cancer.",

An extensive amount of knowledge has been obtained with regard to tumor angiogenesis and tumor lymphangiogenesis, yet little is known about the potential biological effects of \u201cneoneurogenesis\u201d. Cancer cells can exploit the advantage of the factors released by the nerve fibers to generate a positive microenvironment for cell survival and proliferation. At the same time, they can stimulate the formation of neurites by secreting neurotrophic factors and axon guidance molecules. The neuronal influence on the biology of a neoplasm was initially described several decades ago. Since then, an increasing amount of experimental evidence strongly suggests the existence of reciprocal interactions between cancer cells and nerves in humans. Moreover, researchers have been able to demonstrate a crosstalk between cancer cells and nerve fibers as a strategy for survival. Despite all these evidence, a lot remains to be done in order to clarify the role of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and their associated receptor-initiated signaling pathways in the development and progression of cancer, and response to therapy. A global-wide characterization of the neurotransmitters or neuropeptides present in the tumor microenvironment would provide insights into the real biological influences of the neuronal tissue on tumor progression.

In the last decade, independent groups have reported successful but sometimes contradictory results in relation to the potential of AREG to serve as a prognostic and/or predictive marker for oncology, especially with regard to anti-EGFR therapies.

In this perspective, numerous genetic association studies have been performed to discover common ovarian cancer susceptibility variants. Accordingly, there is an increasing need to synthesize the evidence in order to identify true associations.A comprehensive and systematic assessment of all available data on genetic susceptibility to sporadic ovarian cancer was carried out. The evidence of statistically significant findings was evaluated based on the number of positive replications, the ratio of positive and negative studies, and the false-positive report probability (FPRP).The authors reviewed three genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and 147 candidate gene studies, published from 1990 to October 2010, including around 1100 genetic variants in more than 200 candidate genes and 20 intergenic regions. Genetic variants with the strongest evidence for an association with ovarian cancer include the rs2854344 in the RB1 gene and SNPs on chromosomes 9p22.2, 8q24, 2q31, and 19p13. Promising genetic pathways for ovarian cancer include the cell cycle, DNA repair, sex steroid hormone and oncogenic pathway.Concluding, this review shows that many genetic association studies have been performed, but only a few genetic variants show strong evidence for an association with ovarian cancer. More research is needed to elucidate causal genetic variants, taking into consideration gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interactions, combined effects of common and rare variants, and differences between histological subtypes of this cancer.",

Proteins involved in oncogenesis and tumor suppression make up the majority of the known cases for this type of protein destruction.

Only epigenetic aberrations can be reversible, allowing the malignant cell population to revert to a more benign phenotype. The epigenetic therapy of cancers is emerging as an effective and valuable approach to both the chemotherapy and the chemoprevention of cancer. The utilization of epigenetic targets that include histone methyltransferase (HMTase), Histone deacetylatase, and DNA methyltransferase, are emerging as key therapeutic targets.The nuclear receptor binding SET domain (NSD) protein is a family of three HMTases, NSD1, NSD2/MMSET/WHSC1, and NSD3/WHSC1L1, and plays a critical part in chromatin integrity as evidenced by a growing number of conditions linked to the alterations and/or amplification of NSD1, NSD2, and/or NSD3. NSD1, NSD2 and NSD3 are associated with multiple cancers. The amplification of either NSD1 or NSD2 triggers the cellular transformation and thus is key in the early carcinogenesis events. In most cases, reducing the levels of NSD proteins would suppress cancer growth. NSD1 and NSD2 were isolated as genes linked to developmental diseases, such as Sotos syndrome and Wolf\u2013Hirschhorn syndrome, respectively, implying versatile aspects of the NSD proteins. The NSD pathways, however, are not well understood. It is noteworthy that the NSD family is phylogenetically distinct compared to other known lysine-HMTases, Here, we review the current knowledge on NSD1/NSD2/NSD3 in tumorigenesis and prospect their special value for developing novel anticancer drugs.",

     "abstract": "O6-Methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a suicide enzyme that repairs the pre-mutagenic, pre-carcinogenic and pre-toxic DNA damage O6-methylguanine. It also repairs larger adducts on the O6-position of guanine, such as O(6)-[4-oxo-4-(3-pyridyl)butyl]guanine and O6-chloroethylguanine. These adducts are formed in response to alkylating environmental pollutants, tobacco-specific carcinogens and methylating (procarbazine, dacarbazine, streptozotocine, and temozolomide) as well as chloroethylating (lomustine, nimustine, carmustine, and fotemustine) anticancer drugs. MGMT is therefore a key node in the defense against commonly found carcinogens, and a marker of resistance of normal and cancer cells exposed to alkylating therapeutics. MGMT also likely protects against therapy-related tumor formation caused by these highly mutagenic drugs. Since the amount of MGMT determines the level of repair of toxic DNA alkylation adducts, the MGMT expression level provides important information as to cancer susceptibility and the success of therapy. In this article, we describe the methods employed for detecting MGMT and review the literature with special focus on MGMT activity in normal and neoplastic tissues. The available data show that the expression of MGMT varies greatly in normal tissues and in some cases this has been related to cancer predisposition. MGMT silencing in tumors is mainly regulated epigenetically and in brain tumors this correlates with a better therapeutic response. Conversely, up-regulation of MGMT during cancer treatment limits the therapeutic response. In malignant melanoma, MGMT is not related to the therapeutic response, which is due to other mechanisms of inherent drug resistance. For most cancers, studies that relate MGMT activity to therapeutic outcome following O6-alkylating drugs are still lacking.",

     "abstract": "Tumor sequencing projects have been initiated over the last decade with the promising goal of identifying novel cancer genes and potential therapeutic targets. One of the unexpected findings of these projects was the discovery that cancer genomes contain thousands of passenger mutations that are irrelevant to tumor development and are coselected by a small number of driver mutations that constitute the true selection power in cancer progression. Although often discarded and considered to be irrelevant, the value of passenger mutations should not be underestimated, as they are the most important markers of the exposure to various carcinogens and are essential to assess the etiology of individual tumors.Over the last century, the history of cancer epidemiology evolved in different stages and concepts from occupational observational studies beginning in the 18th century, in vitro and in vivo experimental analyses and cancer gene analyses, such as Ha-ras or TP53. Mutation spectra of passenger mutations from various types of cancers not only confirm the findings of molecular epidemiology analysis, but also reveal novel profiles that will extend this knowledge to single tumors in all types of cancer.",

     "abstract": "Chemotherapy is a very important therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment. The failure of conventional and molecularly targeted chemotherapeutic regimes for the treatment of pancreatic cancer highlights a desperate need for novel therapeutic interventions. Chemotherapy often fails to eliminate all tumor cells because of intrinsic or acquired drug resistance, which is the most common cause of tumor recurrence. Overexpression of RAD51 protein, a key player in DNA repair/recombination has been observed in many cancer cells and its hyperexpression is implicated in drug resistance. Recent studies suggest that RAD51 overexpression contributes to the development, progression and drug resistance of pancreatic cancer cells. Here we provide a brief overview of the available pieces of evidence in support of the role of RAD51 in pancreatic tumorigenesis and drug resistance, and hypothesize that RAD51 could serve as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. We discuss the possible involvement of RAD51 in the drug resistance associated with epithelial to mesenchymal transition and with cancer stem cells. Finally, we speculate that targeting RAD51 in pancreatic cancer cells may be a novel approach for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

     "abstract": "Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short amphipathic and cationic peptides that are rapidly internalized across cell membranes. They can be used to deliver molecular cargo, such as imaging agents (fluorescent dyes and quantum dots), drugs, liposomes, peptide/protein, oligonucleotide/DNA/RNA, nanoparticles and bacteriophage into cells. The utilized CPP, attached cargo, concentration and cell type, all significantly affect the mechanism of internalization. The mechanism of cellular uptake and subsequent processing still remains controversial. It is now clear that CPP can mediate intracellular delivery via both endocytic and non-endocytic pathways. In addition, the orientation of the peptide and cargo and the type of linkage are likely important. In gene therapy, the designed cationic peptides must be able to 1) tightly condense DNA into small, compact particles; 2) target the condensate to specific cell surface receptors; 3) induce endosomal escape; and 4) target the DNA cargo to the nucleus for gene expression. The other studies have demonstrated that these small peptides can be conjugated to tumor homing peptides in order to achieve tumor-targeted delivery in vivo. On the other hand, one of the major aims in molecular cancer research is the development of new therapeutic strategies and compounds that target directly the genetic and biochemical agents of malignant transformation. For example, cell penetrating peptide aptamers might disrupt protein\u2013protein interactions crucial for cancer cell growth or survival. In this review, we discuss potential functions of CPPs especially for drug and gene delivery in cancer and indicate their powerful promise for clinical efficacy.",

     "abstract": "The hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) is a pleiotropic transcription factor typically activated in response to low oxygen tension as well as other stress factors in normoxic conditions. Upon activation HIF-1\u03b1 mediates the transcriptional activation of target genes involved in a variety of processes comprising stress adaptation, metabolism, growth and invasion, but also apoptotic cell death. The molecular mechanisms, signaling pathways and downstream targets evoked by the activation of HIF-1\u03b1 in epidermal cells are becoming increasingly understood and underscore the participation of HIF-1\u03b1 in crucial processes including malignant transformation and cancer progression. Recent studies have implicated HIF-1\u03b1 as an integral part of the multifaceted signal transduction initiated by the exposure of keratinocytes to ultraviolet radiation B (UVB), which represents the most ubiquitous hazard for human skin and the principal risk factor for skin cancer. HIF-1\u03b1 activation by UVB exposure contributes to either repair or the removal of UVB-damaged keratinocytes by inducing apoptosis, thus revealing a tumor suppressor role for HIF-1\u03b1 in these cells. On the other hand, the constitutive expression of HIF-1\u03b1 evoked by the mild hypoxic state of the skin has been implicated as a positive factor in the transformation of normal melanocytes into malignant melanoma, one of the most aggressive types of human cancers.

Clinically, UPTs show rapid progression and early dissemination, with signs and symptoms related to the metastatic site. The molecular bases of their biology remain largely unknown, with no evidence as to whether they represent a distinct biological entity.Immunohistochemistry remain the best diagnostic tool in term of cost-effectiveness, but the time-consuming \u201calgorithmic process\u201d it relies on has led to the application of new molecular techniques for the identification of the primary site of UPTs. For example, several microarray or miRNA classifications of UPTs have been used, with an accuracy in the prediction of the primary site as high as 90%. It should be noted that validating a prediction of tissue origin is challenging in these patients, since most of them will never have a primary site identified. Moreover, prospective studies to determine whether selection of treatment options based on such profiling methods actually improves patient outcome are still missing. In the last few years functional imaging (i.e. FDG-PET/CT) has gained a main role in the detection of the site of origin of UPTs and is currently recommended by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. However, despite recent refinements in the diagnostic workup, the site of origin of UPT often remains elusive. As a consequence, treatment of patients with UPT is still empirical and inadequate.",

     "abstract": "Recent development of animal models relevant to human prostate cancer (PC) etiopathogenesis has provided important information on the specific functions provided by key gene products altered during disease initiation and progression to locally invasive, metastatic and hormone-refractory stages. Especially, the characterization of transgenic mouse models has indicated that the inactivation of distinct tumor suppressor proteins such as phosphatase tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), Nkx3.1, p27KIP1, p53 and retinoblastoma (pRb) may cooperate for the malignant transformation of prostatic stem/progenitor cells into PC stem/progenitor cells and tumor development and metastases. Moreover, the sustained activation of diverse oncogenic signaling elements, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), sonic hedgehog, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, c-Myc, Akt and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) also may contribute to the acquisition of more aggressive and hormone-refractory phenotypes by PC stem/progenitor cells and their progenies during disease progression. Importantly, it has also been shown that an enrichment of PC stem/progenitor cells expressing stem cell-like markers may occur after androgen deprivation therapy and docetaxel treatment in the transgenic mouse models of PC suggesting the critical implication of these immature PC cells in treatment resistance, tumor re-growth and disease recurrence. Of clinical interest, the molecular targeting of distinct gene products altered in PC cells by using different dietary compounds has also been shown to counteract PC initiation and progression in animal models supporting their potential use as chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic agents for eradicating the total tumor cell mass, improving current anti-hormonal and chemotherapies and preventing disease relapse.",

This review will also discuss the potential role of SIRT3 as a novel therapeutic target to treat cancer.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most lethal malignant diseases with the worst prognosis. It is ranked as the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Many risk factors have been associated with PC. Interestingly, large numbers of epidemiological studies suggest that obesity and diabetes, especially type-2 diabetes, are positively associated with increased risk of PC. Similarly, these chronic diseases (obesity, diabetes, and cancer) are also a major public health concern. In the U.S. population, 50 percent are overweight, 30 percent are medically obese, and 10 percent have diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, obesity and DM have been considered as potential risk factors for cancers; however, the focus of this article is restricted to PC. Although the mechanisms responsible for the development of these chronic diseases leading to the development of PC are not fully understood, the biological importance of the activation of insulin, insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its receptor (IGF-1R) signaling pathways in insulin resistance mechanism and subsequent induction of compensatory hyperinsulinemia has been proposed. Therefore, targeting insulin/IGF-1 signaling with anti-diabetic drugs for lowering blood insulin levels and reversal of insulin resistance could be useful strategy for the prevention and/or treatment of PC. A large number of studies have demonstrated that the administration of anti-diabetic drugs such as metformin and thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPAR-\u03b3 agonists decreases the risk of cancers, suggesting that these agents might be useful anti-tumor agents for the treatment of PC. In this review article, we will discuss the potential roles of metformin and TZD anti-diabetic drugs as anti-tumor agents in the context of PC and will further discuss the complexities and the possible roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of obesity, diabetes, and PC.",

     "abstract": "Reptin and Pontin belong to the family of AAA+ ATPases (ATPases Associated with various cellular Activities). Several studies have reported their overexpression in cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma and colorectal cancer. Functional studies have implicated them in many cellular processes highly relevant to cancer. They thus interact with the oncogenes c-myc and \u03b2-catenin, and modulate their transcriptional activities. They participate in large molecular complexes such as the INO80 or the TIP60 complexes that are involved in chromatin remodeling or DNA damage repair. They are also required for the biogenesis of telomerase. Studies that used RNA interference or expression of mutated proteins have concluded at their role in cell growth and viability. Interestingly, not all their functions require an intact ATPase domain. Besides their roles as nuclear proteins, recent evidence suggests that they also have cytosolic functions such as regulation of the nonsense mediated decay of mRNAs. Finally, silencing experiments in xenografts indicate that they may be suitable targets for cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Cyclooxygenase (COX) and its derived prostanoids, mainly including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and prostacyclin (PGI2), have well-known roles in cardiovascular disease and cancer, both of which are associated with cigarette smoking. This article is focused on the role of COX-2 pathway in smoke-related pathologies and cancer. Cigarette smoke exposure can induce COX-2 expression and activity, increase PGE2 and TxA2 release, and lead to an imbalance in PGI2 and TxA2 production in favor of the latter. It exerts pro-inflammatory effects in a PGE2-dependent manner, which contributes to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. TxA2 mediates other diverse biologic effects of cigarette smoking, such as platelet activation, cell contraction and angiogenesis, which may facilitate tumor growth and metastasis in smokers. Among cigarette smoke components, nicotine and its derived nitrosamines 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) are the most potent carcinogens. COX-2 and PGE2 have been shown to play a pivotal role in many cancers associated with cigarette smoking, including cancers of lung, gastric and bladder, while the information for the role of TxA2 and PGI2 in smoke-associated cancers is limited. Recent findings from our group have revealed how NNK influences the TxA2 to promote the tumor growth. Better understanding in the above areas may help to generate new therapeutic protocols or to optimize the existing treatment strategy.",

     "abstract": "RasGrf1 and RasGrf2 are highly homologous mammalian guanine nucleotide exchange factors which are able to activate specific Ras or Rho GTPases. The RasGrf genes are preferentially expressed in the central nervous system, although specific expression of either locus may also occur elsewhere. RasGrf1 is a paternally-expressed, imprinted gene that is expressed only after birth. In contrast, RasGrf2 is not imprinted and shows a wider expression pattern. A variety of isoforms for both genes are also detectable in different cellular contexts. The RasGrf proteins exhibit modular structures composed by multiple domains including CDC25H and DHPH motifs responsible for promoting GDP/GTP exchange, respectively, on Ras or Rho GTPase targets. The various domains are essential to define their intrinsic exchanger activity and to modulate the specificity of their functional activity so as to connect different upstream signals to various downstream targets and cellular responses.Despite their homology, RasGrf1 and RasGrf2 display differing target specificities and non overlapping functional roles in a variety of signaling contexts related to cell growth and differentiation as well as neuronal excitability and response or synaptic plasticity. Whereas both RasGrfs are activatable by glutamate receptors, G-protein-coupled receptors or changes in intracellular calcium concentration, only RasGrf1 is reported to be activated by LPA, cAMP, or agonist-activated Trk and cannabinoid receptors. Analysis of various knockout mice strains has uncovered a specific functional contribution of RasGrf1 in processes of memory and learning, photoreception, control of post-natal growth and body size and pancreatic \u03b2-cell function and glucose homeostasis. For RasGrf2, specific roles in lymphocyte proliferation, T-cell signaling responses and lymphomagenesis have been described.",

However, understanding of the underlying mechanisms is still very modest. In this review, we discuss the role of platelets in tumor angiogenesis and growth and suggest their potential significance in malignancies. Platelets contain various pro-and antiangiogenic molecules, which seem to be endocytosed and sequestered in different populations of \u03b1-granules. Furthermore, tumor endothelial cells are phenotypically and functionally different from endothelial cells in healthy tissue, stimulating local platelet adhesion and subsequent activation. As a consequence, platelets are able to secrete their angiogenic and angiostatic content, most likely in a regulated manner. The overall effect of these platelet\u2013endothelium interactions appears to be proangiogenic, stimulating tumor angiogenesis. We favor the view that local adhesion and activation of blood platelets and dysregulation of coagulation represent underestimated pathways in the progression of cancer.",

     "abstract": "The Notch signaling plays a key role in cell differentiation, survival, and proliferation through diverse mechanisms. Notch signaling is also involved in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Moreover, Notch expression is regulated by hypoxia and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and leptin). Entangled crosstalk between Notch and other developmental signaling (Hedgehog and Wnt), and signaling triggered by growth factors, estrogens and oncogenic kinases, could impact on Notch targeted genes. Thus, alterations of the Notch signaling can lead to a variety of disorders, including human malignancies. Notch signaling is activated by ligand binding, followed by ADAM/tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1-converting enzyme (TACE) metalloprotease and \u03b3-secretase cleavages that produce the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). Translocation of NICD into the nucleus induces the transcriptional activation of Notch target genes. The relationships between Notch deregulated signaling, cancer stem cells and the carcinogenesis process reinforced by Notch crosstalk with many oncogenic signaling pathways suggest that Notch signaling may be a critical drug target for breast and other cancers. Since current status of knowledge in this field changes quickly, our insight should be continuously revised. In this review, we will focus on recent advancements in identification of aberrant Notch signaling in breast cancer and the possible underlying mechanisms, including potential role of Notch in breast cancer stem cells, tumor angiogenesis, as well as its crosstalk with other oncogenic signaling pathways in breast cancer. We will also discuss the prognostic value of Notch proteins and therapeutic potential of targeting Notch signaling for cancer treatment.",

An understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to HCC is important in order to be able to design new pharmacological agents serving either to prevent or mitigate the outcome of this malignancy. The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2) cytokine and its isoforms initiate a signaling cascade which is closely linked to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and subsequent progression to HCC. Because of its role in these stages of disease progression, TGF-\u03b2 appears to play a unique role in the molecular pathogenesis of HCC. Thus, it is a promising target for pharmacological treatment strategies. Recent studies have shown that inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling results in multiple synergistic down-stream effects which will likely improve the clinical outcome in HCC. We also review a number of TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors, most of which are still in a preclinical stage of development, but may soon be available for trial in HCC patients. Hence, it is anticipated that there will soon be new agents available for clinical investigations to evaluate the role of the TGF-\u03b2-associated signaling in this deadly cancer.",

     "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a crucial role in several physiological and pathological cell functions, including cell development and cancer, by deacetylating both histones and others proteins. HDACs belong to a large family of enzymes including Class I, II and IV as well as Class III or sirtuins subfamilies, that undergo a complex transcriptional and post-translational regulation. In current years, antitumor therapy is attempting to exploit several chemical classes of inhibitors that target HDACs, frequently reported to be misregulated in cancer. Nevertheless, the identity of gene products directly involved in tumorigenesis and preventing HDAC misregulation in cancer is still poorly understood. Recent evidence has demonstrated that the tumor suppressors HIC1 and DBC1 induce direct repression of Sirt1 function, whereas Chfr and RENKCTD11/KASH family downregulate HDAC1, by inducing its ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Loss of these gene products leads to imbalanced enhancement of HDAC activity and subsequently to oncogenesis. All these genes are frequently deleted or silenced in human cancers, highlighting the role of endogenous HDAC inhibitors to counteracts HDAC-mediated tumorigenesis. Thus, endogenous HDAC inhibitors represent a promising class of \u201cantitumor agents\u201d thanks to which oncogenic addiction pathways may be selectively therapeutically targeted.",

     "abstract": "Changes in the composition of nuclear matrix associated proteins contribute to alterations in nuclear structure, one of the major phenotypes of malignant cancer cells. The malignancy-induced changes in this structure lead to alterations in chromatin folding, the fidelity of genome replication and gene expression programs. The nuclear matrix forms a scaffold upon which the chromatin is organized into periodic loop domains called matrix attachment regions (MAR) by binding to various MAR binding proteins (MARBPs). Aberrant expression of MARBPs modulates the chromatin organization and disrupt transcriptional network that leads to oncogenesis. Dysregulation of nuclear matrix associated MARBPs has been reported in different types of cancers. Some of these proteins have tumor specific expression and are therefore considered as promising diagnostic or prognostic markers in few cancers. SMAR1 (scaffold/matrix attachment region binding protein 1), is one such nuclear matrix associated protein whose expression is drastically reduced in higher grades of breast cancer. SMAR1 gene is located on human chromosome 16q24.3 locus, the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of which has been reported in several types of cancers.

In recent years, however, it has become clear that the picture is not as simple as originally anticipated, as structural precursors of gap junctions can affect cell cycling by performing actions not related to gap junctional intercellular communication. Indeed, connexin hemichannels also foresee a pathway for cell growth communication, albeit between the intracellular compartment and the extracellular environment, while connexin proteins as such can directly or indirectly influence the production of cell cycle regulators independently of their channel activities. Furthermore, a novel set of connexin-like proteins, the pannexins, have lately joined in as regulators of the cell proliferation process, which they can affect as either single units or as channel entities. In the current paper, these multifaceted aspects of connexin-related signalling in cell cycling are reviewed.",

     "abstract": "The protein Numb does not live up to its name. This passive-sounding protein is anything but spent. Originally identified as a cell-fate determinant in Drosophila development, Numb received a good deal of attention as an inhibitor of the Notch receptor signaling pathway. It turns out, however, that Numb does a lot more than simply regulate Notch. It has been implicated in a variety of biochemical pathways connected with signaling (it regulates Notch-, Hedgehog- and TP53-activated pathways), endocytosis (it is involved in cargo internalization and recycling), determination of polarity (it interacts with the PAR complex, and regulates adherens and tight junctions), and ubiquitination (it exploits this mechanism to regulate protein function and stability). This complex biochemical network lies at the heart of Numb's involvement in diverse cellular phenotypes, including cell fate developmental decisions, maintenance of stem cell compartments, regulation of cell polarity and adhesion, and migration. Considering its multifaceted role in cellular homeostasis, it is not surprising that Numb has been implicated in cancer as a tumor suppressor. Our major goal here is to explain the cancer-related role of Numb based on our understanding of its role in cell physiology. We will attempt to do this by reviewing the present knowledge of Numb at the biochemical and functional level, and by integrating its apparently heterogeneous functions into a unifying scenario, based on our recently proposed concept of the \u201cendocytic matrix\u201d. Finally, we will discuss the role of Numb in the maintenance of the normal stem cell compartment, as a starting point to interpret the tumor suppressor function of Numb in the context of the cancer stem cell hypothesis.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a highly lethal malignancy with near 100% mortality. This is in part due to the fact that most patients present with metastatic or locally advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Significantly, in nearly 95% of PC patients there is neither an associated family history of PC nor of diseases known to be associated with an increased risk of PC. These groups of patients who comprise the bulk of PC cases are termed as \u201csporadic PC\u201d in contrast to the familial PC cases that comprise only about 5% of all PCs. Given the insidious onset of the malignancy and its extreme resistance to chemo and radiotherapy, an abundance of research in recent years has focused on identifying biomarkers for the early detection of PC, specifically aiming at the sporadic PC cohort. However, while several studies have established that asymptomatic individuals with a positive family history of PC and those with certain heritable syndromes are candidates for PC screening, the role of screening in identifying sporadic PC is still an unsettled question. The present review attempts to assess this critical question by investigating the recent advances made in molecular markers with potential use in the early diagnosis of sporadic PC \u2014 the largest cohort of PC cases worldwide. It also outlines a novel yet simple risk factor based stratification system that could be potentially employed by clinicians to identify those individuals who are at an elevated risk for the development of sporadic PC and therefore candidates for screening.",

RNase-controlled RNA degradation is a determining factor in the control of gene expression, maturation and turnover, which are further associated with the progression of cancers and infectious diseases. Over the years, RNases purified from multiple origins have drawn increasing attention from medical scientists due to their remarkable antitumor properties. In this review, we present a brief summary of the representative RNases of fungal, bacterial, plant, and animal origins and outline their potential medicinal value in the treatment of tumor and AIDS. Among them, the most clinically promising RNases are mushroom RNases, Binase and Barnase from bacteria, ginseng RNases, and Onconase from frog (Rana pipiens). Fast developing protein engineering of RNases, which display more potent cytotoxic activity on and greater selectivity for malignant cells, has also aroused the interest of researchers. The multiple anti-cancer mechanisms of RNases are also included. To sum up, these inspiring studies unveil a new perspective for RNases as potential therapeutic agents.",

Stat5 proteins are able to regulate cell differentiation and senescence activating the tumor suppressors SOCS1, p53 and PML.

     "abstract": "Elevated lifetime estrogen exposure is a major risk factor for breast cancer. Recent advances in the understanding of breast carcinogenesis clearly indicate that induction of estrogen receptor (ER) mediated signaling is not sufficient for the development of breast cancer. The underlying mechanisms of breast susceptibility to estrogen's carcinogenic effect remain elusive. Physiologically achievable concentrations of estrogen or estrogen metabolites have been shown to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent data implicated that these ROS induced DNA synthesis, increased phosphorylation of kinases, and activated transcription factors, e.g., AP-1, NRF1, E2F, NF-kB and CREB of non-genomic pathways which are responsive to both oxidants and estrogen. Estrogen-induced ROS by increasing genomic instability and by transducing signal through influencing redox sensitive transcription factors play important role (s) in cell transformation, cell cycle, migration and invasion of the breast cancer. The present review discusses emerging data in support of the role of estrogen induced ROS-mediated signaling pathways which may contribute in the development of breast cancer. It is envisioned that estrogen induced ROS mediated signaling is a key complementary mechanism that drives the carcinogenesis process. ROS mediated signaling however occurs in the context of other estrogen induced processes such as ER-mediated signaling and estrogen reactive metabolite-associated genotoxicity. Importantly, estrogen-induced ROS can function as independent reversible modifiers of phosphatases and activate kinases to trigger the transcription factors of downstream target genes which participate in cancer progression.",

Dysregulation of cadherin expression is often associated with disease pathology including tissue dysplasia, tumor formation, and metastasis. Cadherin-17 (CDH17), belonging to a subclass of 7D-cadherin superfamily, is present in fetal liver and gastrointestinal tract during embryogenesis, but the gene becomes silenced in healthy adult liver and stomach tissues. It functions as a peptide transporter and a cell adhesion molecule to maintain tissue integrity in epithelia. However, recent findings from our group and others have reported aberrant expression of CDH17 in major gastrointestinal malignancies including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), stomach and colorectal cancers, and its clinical association with tumor metastasis and advanced tumor stages. Furthermore, alternative splice isoforms and genetic polymorphisms of CDH17 gene have been identified in HCC and linked to an increased risk of HCC. CDH17 is an attractive target for HCC therapy. Targeting CDH17 in HCC can inhibit tumor growth and inactivate Wnt signaling pathway in concomitance with activation of tumor suppressor genes. Further investigation on CDH17-mediated oncogenic signaling and cognate molecular mechanisms would shed light on new targeting therapy on HCC and potentially other gastrointestinal malignancies.",

Recent expression profiling studies have revealed that miRNAs play important regulatory roles in a variety of cellular functions as well as in every cancer type studied so far. Lately, the discovery of miRNAs in the serum of cancer patients opened up the exciting prospective of using miRNAs as powerful and non-invasive cancer biomarkers. In this article, we review the current literature on serum miRNAs in different cancer types and the approaches used to detect and quantify these molecules. We then discuss the potential of miRNA biomarkers to improve disease diagnosis by distinguishing healthy from malignant tissues, identifying the tissue of origin in poorly differentiated tumors or tumors of unknown origin and distinguishing between different subtypes of the same tumor. We will also compare the advantages and disadvantages of potential serum miRNA biomarker molecules for cancer classification, estimation of prognosis and prediction of therapeutic efficacy. Finally, we will establish a set of criteria that these new molecules and clinical studies that use them must fulfill before they can be used as reliable tools in diagnostic and prognostic settings.",

However, aberrant MET activation, due to overexpression, mutations, or autocrine ligand production, contributes to the development and progression of a variety of human cancers, often being associated with poor clinical outcome and drug resistance. B cell malignancies arise from B cells that are clonally expanded at different stages of differentiation. Despite major therapeutic advances, most mature B cell malignancies remain incurable and biologically-oriented therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. This review addresses the role of the HGF/MET pathway during B cell development and discusses how its aberrant activation contributes to the development of B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, with particular emphasis on multiple myeloma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma. These insights, combined with the recent development of clinical-grade agents targeting the MET pathway, provide the rationale to envision the HGF/MET pathway as a new promising target for the treatment of B cell malignancies.",

The main function of autophagy is to maintain intracellular metabolic homeostasis through degradation of unfolded or aggregated proteins and organelles. Although autophagic regulation is a complicated process, solid evidence demonstrates that the PI3K-Akt-mTOR, LKB1-AMPK-mTOR and p53 are the main upstream regulators of the autophagic pathway. Currently, there is a bulk of data indicating the important function of autophagy in cancer. It is noteworthy that autophagy facilitates the cancer cells' resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The abrogation of autophagy potentiates the re-sensitization of therapeutic resistant cancer cells to the anticancer treatment via autophagy inhibitors, such as 3-MA, CQ and BA, or knockdown of the autophagy related molecules. In this review, we summarize the accumulation of evidence for autophagy's involvement in mediating resistance of cancer cells to anticancer therapy and suggest that autophagy might be a potential therapeutic target in anticancer drug resistance in the future.",

Aurora-A is frequently overexpressed in tumor cells and it is therefore regarded as a novel candidate target in anti-cancer therapy. Its actual contribution to cell transformation, however, is not entirely clarified; furthermore, its transforming ability has been found to vary broadly depending on the systems and experimental conditions in which it was assayed. This variability suggests that Aurora-A overexpression requires the concomitant deregulation of partner factor(s) to fully elicit its oncogenic potential. Molecular and structural studies indicate that the full activation and correct mitotic localisation of Aurora-A require its interaction with the spindle regulator TPX2. In this review we propose a brief reappraisal of Aurora-A intrinsic oncogenic features. We then present literature screening data indicating that TPX2 is also overexpressed in many tumor types, and, furthermore, that Aurora-A and TPX2 are frequently co-overexpressed. We therefore propose that the association of Aurora-A and TPX2 gives rise to a novel functional unit with oncogenic properties. We also suggest that some of the roles that are conventionally attributed to Aurora-A in cell transformation and tumorigenesis could in fact be a consequence of the oncogenic activation of this unit.",

     "abstract": "Camptothecin is a selective inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I, and has effective antitumor activity. Recently, camptothecin has been shown to activate the transcription of low-abundance antisense RNAs at the HIF-1\u03b1 gene locus in human cancer cells in a Topoisomerase I-dependent manner. The activation of antisense transcription is likely due to sustained drug interference with transcription regulation mechanisms leading to a more open chromatin conformation and de-repression/activation of antisense transcription. Camptothecin readily inhibits Topoisomerase I in cells, and the enzyme inhibition activates transcriptional Cdk (Cdk9 and/or Cdk7) activity leading to the hyperphosphorylation of the CTD of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). This results in an alteration of RNAP II regulation with specific effects at transcription levels. Thus, the findings have documented that camptothecin can interfere with specific transcription regulatory steps, impairing the balance of cellular antisense and sense transcripts at the HIF-1\u03b1 gene locus. That may have a considerable impact on cancer therapy development particularly for non-responsive human tumors.",

This success has spawned myriad efforts to develop similarly targeted drugs for other cancers. Unfortunately, the high expectations of these efforts have not yet been realized, likely due to the genetic diversity among and within tumors, as well as the complex and largely unpredictable interactions of drug-like compounds with innumerable targets that affect cellular and organismal metabolism. While improvements in sequencing technologies are beginning to address the first problem, solving the second problem requires methods for linking specific features of the cancer genome to their optimally targeted therapies.

In addition to a role in development, recent evidence suggests that TBX2 and TBX3 are overexpressed in a number of cancers, including melanoma, breast, liver, lung, pancreas, ovarian, and cervical cancers. However, there is little information about the mechanisms for how these T-box genes contribute to tumorigenesis. Upregulation of TBX2 and TBX3 suppresses the expression of p14ARF and p21CIP1 and promotes bypass of senescence through inactivation of p53 pathway. TBX2 functionally interacts with pRb, and pRb modulates TBX2 functional specificity. In addition, TBX2 is a player of Wnt signaling while TBX3 is a downstream target of the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway, and overexpression of TBX2 and TBX3 represses the expression of E-cadherin, which is demonstrated to be a prerequisite for epithelial tumor cell invasion.

     "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression is a fundamental step in cellular physiology as abnormalities in this process may lead to de-regulated growth and cancer. Translation of mRNA is mainly regulated at the rate-limiting initiation step, where many eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) are involved. The largest and most complex initiation factor is eIF3 which plays a role in translational regulation, cell growth and cancer. The largest subunit of eIF3 is eIF3a, although it is not required for the general function of eIF3 in translation initiation. However, eIF3a may play a role as a regulator of a subset of mRNAs and has been demonstrated to regulate the expression of p27kip1, tyrosinated \u03b1-tubulin and ribonucleotide reductase M2 subunit. These molecules have a pivotal role in the regulation of the cell cycle. Moreover, the eIF3a mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in all tissues at different levels and is found elevated in a number of cancer types. eIF3a can modulate the cell cycle and may be a translational regulator for proteins important for entrance into S phase. The expression of eIF3a is decreased in differentiated cells in culture and the suppression of eIF3a expression can reverse the malignant phenotype and change the sensitivity of cells to cell cycle modulators. However, the role of eIF3a in cancer is still unclear. In fact, some studies have identified eIF3a to be involved in cancer development, while other results indicate that it could provide protection against evolution into higher malignancy. Together, these findings highlight the \u201ctricky\u201d and interesting nature of eIF3a.",

     "abstract": "Most aspects of leukocyte physiology are under the control of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation. It is clear that excessive phosphorylation of signal transduction elements is a pivotal element of many different pathologies including haematological malignancies and accordingly, strategies that target such phosphorylation have clinically been proven highly successful for treatment of multiple types of leukemias and lymphomas. Cellular phosphorylation status is dependent on the resultant activity of kinases and phosphatases. The cell biology of the former is now well understood; for most cellular phosphoproteins we now know the kinases responsible for their phosphorylation and we understand the principles of their aberrant activity in disease. With respect to phosphatases, however, our knowledge is much patchier. Although the sequences of whole genomes allow us to identify phosphatases using in silico methodology, whereas transcription profiling allows us to understand how phosphatase expression is regulated during disease, most functional questions as to substrate specificity, dynamic regulation of phosphatase activity and potential for therapeutic intervention are still to a large degree open. Nevertheless, recent studies have allowed us to make meaningful statements on the role of tyrosine phosphatase activity in the three major signaling pathways that are commonly affected in leukemias, i.e. the Ras\u2013Raf\u2013ERK1/2, the Jak\u2013STAT and the PI3K\u2013PKB\u2013mTOR pathways.

UCH-L1 possesses deubiquitinating activity and dimerization-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity, and functions as a mono-ubiquitin stabilizer; UCH-L3 does both deubiquitinating and deneddylating activity, except dimerization or ligase activity, and unlike UCH-L1, can interact with Lys48-linked Ub dimers to protect it from degradation and in the meanwhile to inhibit its hydrolase activity; UCH37 is responsible for the deubiquitinating activity in the 19S proteasome regulatory complex, and as indicated by the recent study, UCH37 is also associated with the human Ino80 chromatin-remodeling complex (hINO80) in the nucleus and can be activated via transient association of 19S regulatory particle- or proteasome-bound hRpn13 with hINO80; BAP1, binding to the wild-type BRCA1 RING finger domain, is regarded as a tumor suppressor, but for such suppressing activity, as demonstrated otherwise, both deubiquitinating activity and nucleus localization are required.

Another chemokine and chemokine receptor pair, the CXCL16/CXCR6 axis, has been studied by several independent research groups. Here, we summarize recent advances in our knowledge of the function of CXC chemokine receptor CXCR6 and its ligand CXCL16 in regulating metastasis and invasion of cancer. CXCR6 and CXCL16 are up-regulated in multiple cancer tissue types and cancer cell lines relative to normal tissues and cell lines. In addition, both CXCR6 and CXCL16 levels increase as tumor malignancy increases. Trans-membranous CXCL16 chemokine reduces proliferation while soluble CXCL16 chemokine enhances proliferation and migration. TM-CXCL16 functions as an inducer for lymphocyte build-up around tumor sites. High trans-membranous CXCL16 expression correlates with a good prognosis.

     "abstract": "The discovery that Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastric cancer has led to numerous studies that investigate the mechanisms by which H. pylori induces carcinogenesis. Gastric cancer shows genetic instability both in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, besides impairment of important DNA repair pathways. As such, this review highlights the consequences of H. pylori infection on the integrity of DNA in the host cells. By down-regulating major DNA repair pathways, H. pylori infection has the potential to generate mutations. In addition, H. pylori infection can induce direct changes on the DNA of the host, such as oxidative damage, methylation, chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and mutations. Interestingly, H. pylori infection generates genetic instability in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA.Based on the reviewed literature we conclude that H. pylori infection promotes gastric carcinogenesis by at least three different mechanisms: (1) a combination of increased endogenous DNA damage and decreased repair activities, (2) induction of mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, and (3) generation of a transient mutator phenotype that induces mutations in the nuclear genome.",

While not expressed in the normal mammary gland, PTK6 expression is detected in a large proportion of human mammary gland tumors. In breast tumor cells, PTK6 promotes growth factor signaling and cell migration. PTK6 expression is also increased in a number of other epithelial tumors, including ovarian and colon cancer. In contrast, PTK6 is expressed in diverse normal epithelia, including the linings of the gastrointestinal tract, skin and prostate, where its expression correlates with cell cycle exit and differentiation. Disruption of the mouse Ptk6 gene leads to increased growth and impaired differentiation in the small intestine that is accompanied by increased AKT and Wnt signaling. Following total body irradiation, PTK6 expression is induced in proliferating progenitor cells of the intestine, where it plays an essential role in DNA-damage induced apoptosis. A distinguishing feature of PTK6 is its flexibility in intracellular localization, due to a lack of amino-terminal myristoylation/palmitoylation. Recently a number of substrates of PTK6 have been identified, including nuclear RNA-binding proteins and transcription factors. We discuss PTK6 signaling, its apparent conflicting roles in cancer and normal epithelia, and its potential as a therapeutic target in epithelial cancers.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and one of the most frequent types of cancer worldwide. It normally develops in patients with chronic liver disease, especially cirrhosis, although some cases without an apparent underlying liver disease have been reported. The pathogenesis of HCC is multi-factorial and complex. Hepatitis viruses are the main factors favoring the development of HCC. In fact, chronic inflammation associated with hepatitis C or B virus infection can lead to progressive liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and ultimately HCC. Chronic inflammation and liver fibrosis cause a continuous remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM), a dynamic process that involves several molecules including integrins and matrix processing enzymes. An increasing body of evidence indicates that ADAMs are involved in promoting tumor formation and progression of HCC. A Disintegrin And Metalloproteases (ADAMs) are a group of proteins belonging to the zinc protease superfamily. ADAMs are usually transmembrane proteins that contain disintegrin and metalloprotease domains and are, therefore, able to carry out both cell adhesion and protease activities. Soluble isoforms of ADAMs have also been discovered and characterized. In this review, we focus on the contribution of ADAM proteins to HCC tumorigenesis and cancer progression. The potential role of ADAMs as key modulators of tumor\u2013stroma interactions during tumor progression, by means of the activities of their constituent domains, is also discussed.",

Both methodological and inherent biological issues underlie the differential cell responses, including reported difficulties in EPOR protein detection, potential involvement of EPOR isoforms or of cytoplasmic EPOR, possible differential structure and/or binding affinities of hematopoietic versus non-hematopoietic cell EPOR, possible aberrant regulation of EPOR activity, and a functional EPO/EPOR autocrine/paracrine loop.The modulation by rhEPO of tumor cell response to anticancer agents is coincident with modulation of multiple signaling pathways, BCL-2 family proteins, caspases and NFkB. The molecular interplay of pro-survival and pro-death signals, triggered by EPO and/or by anticancer agents, is multifactorial and tightly coordinated.

     "abstract": "Treating malignant brain tumors represents one of the most formidable challenges in oncology. Contemporary treatment of brain tumors has been hampered by limited drug delivery across the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) to the tumor bed. Biomaterials are playing an increasingly important role in developing more effective brain tumor treatments. In particular, polymer (nano)particles can provide prolonged drug delivery directly to the tumor following direct intracerebral injection, by making them physiochemically able to cross the BBB to the tumor, or by functionalizing the material surface with peptides and ligands allowing the drug-loaded material to be systemically administered but still specifically target the tumor endothelium or tumor cells themselves. Biomaterials can also serve as targeted delivery devices for novel therapies including gene therapy, photodynamic therapy, anti-angiogenic and thermotherapy. Nanoparticles also have the potential to play key roles in the diagnosis and imaging of brain tumors by revolutionizing both preoperative and intraoperative brain tumor detection, allowing early detection of pre-cancerous cells, and providing real-time, longitudinal, non-invasive monitoring/imaging of the effects of treatment. Additional efforts are focused on developing biomaterial systems that are uniquely capable of delivering tumor-associated antigens, immunotherapeutic agents or programming immune cells in situ to identify and facilitate immune-mediated tumor cell killing. The continued translation of current research into clinical practice will rely on solving challenges relating to the pharmacology of nanoparticles but it is envisioned that novel biomaterials will ultimately allow clinicians to target tumors and introduce multiple, pharmaceutically relevant entities for simultaneous targeting, imaging, and therapy in a unique and unprecedented manner.",

     "abstract": "Investigations over the last decade have established the essential role of growth factors and their receptors during angiogenesis and carcinogenesis. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) family in mammals contains three members, VEGFR-1 (Flt-1), VEGFR-2 (KDR/Flk-1) and VEGFR-3 (Flt-4), which are transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors that regulate the formation of blood and lymphatic vessels. In the early 1990s, the above VEGFR was structurally characterized by cDNA cloning. Among these three receptors, VEGFR-2 is generally recognized to have a principal role in mediating VEGF-induced responses. VEGFR-2 is considered as the earliest marker for endothelial cell development. Importantly, VEGFR-2 directly regulates tumor angiogenesis. Therefore, several inhibitors of VEGFR-2 have been developed and many of them are now in clinical trials. In addition to targeting endothelial cells, the VEGF/VEGFR-2 system works as an essential autocrine/paracrine process for cancer cell proliferation and survival. Recent studies mark the continuous and increased interest in this related, but distinct, function of VEGF/VEGFR-2 in cancer cells: the autocrine/paracrine loop. Several mechanisms regulate VEGFR-2 levels and modulate its role in tumor angiogenesis and physiologic functions, i.e.: cellular localization/trafficking, regulation of cis-elements of promoter, epigenetic regulation and signaling from Notch, cytokines/growth factors and estrogen, etc. In this review, we will focus on updated information regarding VEGFR-2 research with respect to the molecular mechanisms of VEGFR-2 regulation in human breast cancer. Investigations in the activation, function, and regulation of VEGFR-2 in breast cancer will allow the development of new pharmacological strategies aimed at directly targeting cancer cell proliferation and survival.",

Primary components of the DISC are trimerized TRAIL-R1/-R2, FADD, caspase 8 and caspase 10. The anti-apoptotic protein FLIP can also be recruited to the DISC to replace caspase 8 and form an inactive complex. Caspase 8/10 processing at the DISC triggers the caspase cascade, which eventually leads to apoptotic cell death. Besides TRAIL, TRAIL-R1- or TRAIL-R2-selective variants of TRAIL and agonistic antibodies have been designed. These ligands are of interest as anti-cancer agents since they selectively kill tumor cells. To increase tumor sensitivity to TRAIL death receptor-mediated apoptosis and to overcome drug resistance, TRAIL receptor ligands have already been combined with various therapies in preclinical models. In this review, we discuss factors influencing the initial steps of the TRAIL apoptosis signaling pathway, focusing on mechanisms modulating DISC assembly and caspase activation at the DISC. These insights will direct rational design of drug combinations with TRAIL receptor ligands to maximize DISC signaling.",

The expression of certain genes that directly control the rate of key metabolic pathways including glycolysis, lipogenesis and nucleotide synthesis are drastically altered at different stages of tumor progression.

This review summarizes the recent information about the mechanistic link of these genes to oncogenesis and their potential utility as diagnostic markers as well as for therapeutic targets. We particularly focus on three groups of genes; GLUT1, G6PD, TKTL1 and PGI/AMF in glycolytic pathway, ACLY, ACC1 and FAS in lipogenesis and RRM2, p53R2 and TYMS for nucleotide synthesis. All these genes are highly up-regulated in a variety of tumor cells in cancer patients, and they play active roles in tumor progression rather than expressing merely as a consequence of phenotypic change of the cancer cells. Molecular dissection of their orchestrated networks and understanding the exact mechanism of their expression will provide a window of opportunity to target these genes for specific cancer therapy.

In normal adult physiology, the pathway is implicated in stem cell maintenance, tissue repair and regeneration. However, the pathway's darker side is its involvement in several types of human cancer, to which it confers growth promoting and/or survival capabilities to the cancer cell to varying degrees, and by different mechanisms. The Hh pathway is firmly linked to the etiology of basal cell carcinoma and to at least a subset of medulloblastoma. There is increasing evidence that other sporadic cancers, including those in pancreas, prostate, lung, and breast, could also be dependent on Hh pathway activity. In this review, we provide an overview of the pathway's role in various tumor types, where much of the framework for Hh-dependent malignancies has been elucidated in experimental mouse models. We discuss three different signal transduction models for the pathway's involvement in cancer: i) ligand-independent signaling, ii) ligand-dependent autocrine/juxtacrine signaling, and iii) ligand-dependent paracrine signaling. These different modes of signaling may have implications for future therapeutic interventions aimed at inhibiting the pathway during disease. In addition, crosstalk with other pathways, and indications of non-canonical Hh signaling in cancer cells may further cause complications, or perhaps possibilities, in the treatment regimen.

Clinical, molecular, and epidemiological investigations have identified persistent infection with high risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) as the major cause of CC. HR-HPVs lead to development of cervical carcinoma, predominantly through the action of E5, E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins. After HR-HPV infection, viral proteins employ strategies to modulate apoptosis. The E2 viral protein induces apoptosis in both normal and HPV-transformed cells through activation of caspase-8. The E5 protein can impair CD95L- and TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, which suggests that it may prevent apoptosis at early stages of viral infection. E6 inhibits apoptosis through the proteolytic inactivation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as p53, FADD, or procaspase-8, employing the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, or through interactions with proteins that form the death-inducing signaling complex (DISC) such as TNF-R1. On the other hand, E7 oncoprotein expressing cells are usually predisposed to undergo apoptosis. Useful targets for therapeutic strategies would interfere with expression or function of HR-HPV proteins to eliminate cells that express viral oncoproteins. In this review, we summarize the available data on the interaction of early HPV proteins with cellular factors that promote cell death, and the functional consequences of these interactions on apoptosis.",

Bone tumors are related to the existence of a vicious cycle between bone resorption and tumor proliferation in which the molecular triad osteoprotegerin (OPG)/receptor activator of NF-kappaB (RANK)/RANK ligand (RANKL) plays a pivotal role. RANKL, a member of the TNF superfamily, is one of the main inducers of bone resorption. Its soluble receptor OPG represents a promising therapeutic candidate as it prevents bone lesions and inhibits associated tumor growth. However, its therapeutic use in bone tumors remains controversial due to its ability to bind and inhibit another member of the TNF superfamily, TNF related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), which is a potent inducer of tumor cell apoptosis. Through its heparin binding domain, OPG is also able to bind proteoglycans present in the bone matrix. This paper is an overview of the involvement of the micro-environment, as represented by the balance of RANKL/TRAIL and the presence of proteoglycans in the regulation of OPG biological activity in bone tumors.",

     "abstract": "Recent years have seen a surge in interest in cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) as an efficient means for delivering therapeutic targets into cellular compartments. The cell membrane is impermeable to hydrophilic substances yet linking to CPP can facilitate delivery into cells. Thus the unique translocatory property of CPP ensures they remain an attractive carrier, with the capacity to deliver cargoes in an efficient manner having applications in drug delivery, gene transfer and DNA vaccination. Fundamental for an effective vaccine is the delivery of antigen epitopes to antigen-presenting cells, ensuing processing and presentation and induction of an immune response. Vaccination with proteins or synthetic peptides incorporating CTL epitopes have proven limited due to the failure for exogenous antigens to be presented efficiently to T cells. Linking of antigens to CPP overcomes such obstacles by facilitating cellular uptake, processing and presentation of exogenous antigen for the induction of potent immune responses. This review will encompass the various strategies for the delivery of whole proteins, T cell epitopes and preclinical studies utilizing CPP for cancer vaccines.",

Recent studies have shown promising developments in anti-telomerase cancer immunotherapy, using human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) as a tumor antigen. Vaccination, using hTERT peptides or adoptive transfer of hTERT-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, induces augmented tumor regression. CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, against various hTERT peptides, lyse hTERT-expressing tumor cells from multiple tissue origins. CD4+ helper T lymphocytes are also activated by peptides derived from hTERT. This article reviews the current and potential future applications of various hTERT peptide antigens as candidates for cancer vaccines, and explores the experimental challenges that needed to be faced to develop telomerase-based tumor vaccines to treat human cancer.",

     "publication date": "01-2010",
     "abstract": "This review focuses on the roles of two major cold-inducible RNA binding proteins known in human cells: CIRP and RBM3. Both proteins were discovered when they were shown to be induced after exposure to a moderate cold-shock and other cellular stresses such as UV radiation and hypoxia. Initially, it was suggested that these proteins have a suppressive rather stimulatory effect on proliferation; however, proliferative and/or proto-oncogenic functions have recently been assigned to CIRP and RBM3. In a high throughput genetic screen, we recently identified CIRP as an immortalized gene in murine primary cells. On the other hand, the role of RBM3 in transformation has already been demonstrated. Interestingly, both CIRP and RBM3 have been found to be up-regulated in human tumors. This article highlights the roles of CIRP and RBM3 in tumorigenesis, and proposes a model by which CIRP might contribute to senescence bypass by counteracting the deleterious effects of oxidative damage.",

     "abstract": "Immunogenic profile of certain cancer cell death mechanisms has been transmuted by research published over a period of last few years and this change has been so drastic that a new (sub)class of apoptotic cancer cell death, redefined as \u2018immunogenic apoptosis\u2019 has started taking shape. In fact, it has been shown that this chemotherapeutic agent-specific immunogenic cancer cell death modality has the capabilities to induce \u2018anticancer vaccine effect\u2019, in vivo. These new trends have given an opportunity to combine tumour cell kill and antitumour immunity within a single paradigm, a sort of \u2018holy grail\u2019 of anticancer therapeutics. At the molecular level, it has been shown that the immunological silhouette of these cell death pathways is defined by a set of molecules called \u2018damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)\u2019. Various intracellular molecules like calreticulin (CRT), heat-shock proteins (HSPs), high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB1) protein, have been shown to be DAMPs exposed/secreted in a stress agent/factor-and cell death-specific manner. These discoveries have motivated further research into discovery of new DAMPs, new pathways for their exposure/secretion, search for new agents capable of inducing immunogenic cell death and urge to solve currently present problems with this paradigm. We anticipate that this emerging amalgamation of DAMPs, immunogenic cell death and anticancer therapeutics may be the key towards squelching cancer-related mortalities, in near future.",

     "abstract": "The realization that microRNAs are intimately linked to cancer pathogenesis has spawned an explosion of research activity in recent years. Their presence is not merely predictive of tumor origin and behavior, they are causally linked to the emergence and development of cancer by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. The understanding of the functional consequences of altered microRNA expression in cancer is progressing rapidly, even though the prediction of microRNA targets is still a hit and miss process. MicroRNAs may not act primarily by strongly reducing the expression of a few prominent cancer-regulatory genes, but by influencing the properties of the network of which these regulators are a central part. By coordinately regulating many genes, microRNAs are exquisitely suited to act as stabilizers of networks and to prevent extreme variations in phenotype due to intrinsic and extrinsic disturbances. Many advanced tumors show defects in microRNA expression and processing, which could increase phenotypic variability within tumors. This allows small subsets of cells with altered characteristics to emerge, which can have grave consequences as typically a small fraction of tumor cells is responsible for metastasis and treatment resistance, and ultimately treatment failure. Investigating microRNAs from the perspective of master regulators of network stability in cancer calls for new experimental approaches and may help to understand causes of cancer heterogeneity and disease progression.",

In addition, we describe the current knowledge regarding the function of miRNAs in endothelial cell biology.

Because of the high resistance to chemo and radiation therapy, the overall survival rate for pancreatic cancer is extremely low. Recent advances in drug delivery systems hold great promise for improving cancer therapy. Using liposomes, nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes to deliver cancer drugs and other therapeutic agents such as siRNA, suicide gene, oncolytic virus, small molecule inhibitor, and antibody has been a success in recent preclinical trials. However, how to improve the specificity and stability of the delivered drug using ligand or antibody directed delivery represent a major problem. Therefore, developing novel, specific, tumor-targeted drug delivery systems is urgently needed for this terrible disease.

     "abstract": "With rare exceptions, spontaneous tumors originate from a single cell. Yet, at the time of clinical diagnosis, the majority of human tumors display startling heterogeneity in many morphological and physiological features, such as expression of cell surface receptors, proliferative and angiogenic potential. To a substantial extent, this heterogeneity might be attributed to morphological and epigenetic plasticity, but there is also strong evidence for the co-existence of genetically divergent tumor cell clones within tumors. In this perspective, we summarize the sources of intra-tumor phenotypic heterogeneity with emphasis on genetic heterogeneity. We review experimental evidence for the existence of both intra-tumor clonal heterogeneity as well as frequent evolutionary divergence between primary tumors and metastatic outgrowths. Furthermore, we discuss potential biological and clinical implications of intra-tumor clonal heterogeneity.",
