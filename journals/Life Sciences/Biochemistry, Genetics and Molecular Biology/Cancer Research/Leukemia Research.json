     "abstract": "The infusion of autograft absolute lymphocyte and monocyte counts affect survival in patients undergoing autologous peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (APHSCT). However, the specific autograft immune effector cells affecting survival post-APHSCT are unknown. Thus, we performed an ad hoc analysis from our published double-blind, randomized phase III clinical trial in non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (NHL) patients, looking at the infused autograft immune effector cells and their relationship with clinical outcomes post-APHSCT.Between December 2007 and October 2010, we performed a double-blind phase III randomized study registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00566228. A total of 111 patients finished the trial and apheresis collection samples were analyzed for immune effector cells. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated from the date of APHSCT.With a median follow-up of 82.8 months (range: 2.1\u2013122.3 months), we identified by univariate analysis that the autograft numbers of macrophage type 1 (M 1), macrophage type 2 (M 2), dendritic cell type 1 (DC 1), dendritic cell type 2 (DC 2), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), CD4+PD-1-, CD4+PD-1+, CD8+PD-1-, CD8+PD-1+, lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (A-LMR), NKp30, and KIR2DL2, were predictors for OS and PFS. Multivariate analysis revealed that A-LMR, MDSC, NKp30, KIR2DL2 and lactate dehydrogenase were independent predictors for OS. Independent predictors for PFS identified by multivariate analysis included DC1, MDSC, NKp30, CD4+PD-1- and M 2.Our findings indicate that the number of specific infused autograft immune effector cells affect survival ; thus providing a platform to develop an immunocompetent autograft with direct impact on clinical outcomes in NHL post-APHSCT.",

     "abstract": "Leukemic stem cells (LSCs), defined by CD34/CD38 expression, are believed to be essential for leukemia initiation and therapy resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, the side population (SP), characterized by high Hoechst 33342 efflux, reflecting therapy resistance, has leukemia initiating ability. The purpose of this study is, in both CD34-positive and CD34-negative AML, to integrate both types of LSC compartment into a new more restricted definition. Different CD34/CD38/SP defined putative LSC and normal hematopoietic compartments, with neoplastic or normal nature, respectively, were thus identified after cell sorting, and confirmed by FISH/PCR. Stem cell activity was assessed in the long-term liquid culture stem cell assay. SP fractions harbored the strongest functional stem cell activity in both normal and neoplastic cells in both CD34-positive and CD34-negative AML. Overall, inclusion of SP fraction decreased the size of the putative CD34/CD38 defined LSC compartment by a factor >500. For example, for the important CD34+CD38- LSC compartment, the median SP/CD34+CD38- frequency was 5.1 per million WBC (CD34-positive AML), and median SP/CD34-CD38+ frequency (CD34-negative AML) was 1796 per million WBC. Improved detection of LSC may enable identification of therapy resistant clones, and thereby identification of novel LSC specific, HSC sparing, therapies.",

     "abstract": "Systemic Mastocytosis (SM) is a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) that is characterized by a clonal proliferation of mast cells (MCs). The symptoms and clinical presentation of SM are the result of both MC proliferation as well as activation and degranulation, causing hyperactive and over-exaggerated hypersensitivity responses, as well as organ infiltration by pathogenic MCs. The clinical presentation and course of SM is varied and organ involvement can lead to significant morbidity and mortality in some cases. The subtypes of SM include indolent SM (ISM), smoldering SM (SSM), aggressive SM (ASM), SM with associated hematologic neoplasm (SM-AHN) and mast cell leukemia (MCL) and survival can range from normal in the case of ISM to months in MCL. The treatment of indolent forms of SM is largely focused on addressing symptom burden (B findings), while cytoreductive agents and more recently molecularly targeted agents are employed to reduce MC burden and reverse associated organ dysfunction (C findings). Although the pathogenesis of SM is multi-factorial, the acquisition of KIT D816\u2009V is a relatively frequent mutational event and serves as the target of novel agents. The recent approval of midostaurin for the treatment of advanced SM has brought awareness to this disease and energized further drug development efforts. Expanding our understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of SM will continue to inform future therapeutic approaches.",

     "abstract": "Iron metabolism is altered in a variety of cancers; however, little is known about the role of iron metabolism in the biology and response to therapy of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here we show that SLC40A1, the gene encoding the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN), is variably expressed among primary AMLs and that low levels are associated with good prognosis and improved outcomes. In particular, core binding factor (CBF) AMLs, which are associated with good outcomes with chemotherapy, consistently have low level of SLC40A1 expression. AML cell lines that expressed relatively low levels of FPN endogenously, or were engineered via gene knockdown, had an increased sensitivity to chemotherapy relative to controls expressing high levels of FPN. Primary FPNlow AML bulk cells also had increased sensitivity to Ara-C treatment, iron treatment and the combination of Ara-C and iron relative to FPNhigh cells. FPNlow leukemic stem cells (LSCs) had decreased viability following addition of iron alone and in combination with Ara-C treatment relative to FPNhigh LSCs. Together these observations suggest a model where FPN mediated iron metabolism may play a role in chemosensitivity and outcome to therapy in AML.",

Until now, hypomethylating agents (HMAs) are the only drugs that have been approved by FDA in remedying this complicated prognosis disease, but without satisfactory outcome. So, biomarkers of better clinical outcome are of great significance. Many studies have already reported the potential prognostic value of DNA methylation pathway related gene (TET2/DNMT3\u2009A/IDH) mutations in demethylation therapy patients, with controversial results. Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to investigate their prognostic impact on HMAs treated MDS.Databases, including PubMed, Embase, web of science and the Cochrane Library, were searched for relevant studies published up to 29 May 2018. Overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) were selected as endpoints. We extracted odds ratio to evaluate the effect of mutations on ORR, and the corresponding hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for OS.A total of 13 cohort studies, covering 1398 patients with MDS treated by HMAs were included in the final meta-analysis. Our results indicated that DNMT3\u2009A mutations had a favorable impact (P\u2009=\u20090.008) and TET2 mutations, which showed no significance (P\u2009=\u20090.06) in all included patients, could imply good efficacy in some subgroups on ORR. However, none advantages of mutations on ORR translated into a benefit in overall survival.This meta-analysis indicates one favorable factor, DNMT3\u2009A mutations, on ORR in MDS patients with HMAs therapy. The identification of mutations in DNMT3\u2009A can improve clinical efficacy and help make treatment decisions.",

     "abstract": "B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in adults remains a highly challenging disease. Identifying new prognostic biomarkers is necessary to help select the best therapeutic schedules and to improve prognosis. We performed bioinformatics analyses of transcriptomic data to identify aberrantly-expressed mRNA transcripts in B-ALL and focused on RASD1 (Ras-related dexamethasone-induced 1). To date, no information is available on the prognostic value of RASD1 in B-ALL. Fifty-three consecutive adults with de novo B-ALL were enrolled in this study. Our data suggested that RASD1 was abnormally overexpressed in B-ALL. High RASD1 transcript levels at diagnosis were associated with lower survival probabilities (44% [20%\u201361%] vs. 79% [60%\u201397%]; P\u2009=\u20090.037) and were also an independent prognostic factor in adult B-ALL (HR\u2009=\u20094.9 [1.5\u201315.9]; P\u2009=\u20090.008). Functional in vitro analyses and bioinformatic analyses indicated that RASD1 promoted cell proliferation, cell cycle progression and chemotherapy resistance and inhibited cell apoptosis. These data demonstrated that RASD1 might serve as a novel prognostic biomarker for adult B-ALL and as a potential therapeutic target in adult B-ALL patients.",

     "abstract": "Therapeutic decision making is often challenging in older AML patients. We collected retrospective data of 355 consecutive AML patients (\u226560 years) who were treated with intensive chemotherapy (IC) (n\u2009=\u2009155), hypomethylating agents (HMA) (n\u2009=\u200983), or best supportive care (BSC) (n\u2009=\u2009117) between 2002 and 2017. Overall survival (OS) and response rates after therapy were analyzed. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to analyze the impact of different treatment strategies on survival. The median OS was not significantly different between patients treated with IC or HMA (14.9 vs 10.9 months; HR\u2009=\u20091.32, p\u2009=\u20090.076)), despite a difference in complete remission rate (59% after IC vs 35% after HMA). Patients who received a allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo HCT) after treatment with IC or HMA had a significant survival benefit compared to patient who didn\u2019t proceed to allo HCT (median OS 65 vs 8 months, respectively, p\u2009<\u20090.001). The type of induction therapy (i.e. IC or HMA) did not impact on survival after allo HCT (48 vs 65 months, respectively, p\u2009=\u20090.440). In conclusion, consolidation with an allo HCT provides a significant benefit for older AML patients independent of upfront treatment with IC or HMA.

In hematologic malignancies, there is limited information except for Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and there is even less information regarding myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Therefore, we explored this by first measuring PD-1 and PD-L1 levels (percentage of positive cells) in 63 patients with Philadelphia chromosome-negative MPN (Ph(-) MPN), including 16\u2009MF (12 PMF, 2 post-PV-MF, 2 post-ET-MF), 29\u2009ET, and 18\u2009PV.

We further found a higher incidence of higher expression levels (more than 50% of cells with positive expression) of PD-1 and PD-L1 (20% and 26%, respectively) in the CD34+ cells; in contrast, we found a low incidence (0.08\u20131.8%) in the immune cells in MPN patients. PD-1 and PD-L1 levels were also measured by MFI methods, and we obtained similar results except the measurements by percentage appeared to be more sensitive than the MFI methods. We found no correlation between PD-1 and PD-L1 expression levels and clinical features including WBC, platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, presence or absence of the JAK2, MPL, or CALR gene mutation, or splenomegaly. Since MPN represents stem cell disorders, the presence of elevated expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in these cells suggests that the exploration of PD-1 and PD-L1 pathway inhibitor therapy may be worthwhile in Ph(-) MPN.",

Subanalysis of major subsets identified three ultra-HR-CLL groups: men with TP53 disruption with/without CK, women with TP53 disruption with CK and men/women with CK\u2009+\u2009del(11q) with poor short-term outcomes (25% deaths/12 mo). Besides confirming the combinations of known risk-factors, the used patient similarity network added further refinement of subsets of HR-CLL patients who may profit from different targeted drugs.This study showed for the first time in hemato-oncology the usefulness of the multivariate patient similarity networks for stratification of HR-CLL patients. This approach shows the potential for clinical implementation of precision medicine, which is especially important in view of an armamentarium of novel targeted drugs.",

LA utilized more markers for MDS diagnosis than USA/Canada (p\u2009=\u20090.006), but similar to Europe. The use of MDS scoring systems differed among regions: 10.3% in LA, 0% USA/Canada and 25.7% Europe reported the \u201cOgata score\u201d. Finally, 52.0% of all participants included a general interpretation statement in the final report about the consistency of the FC results with MDS diagnosis, with no statistical differences between regions.This survey shows a low compliance with the IMDSflow recommendations and a scarce use of the scoring systems proposed in the literature. However, the number of surface markers used is high. We will work to develop a FC consensus for MDS diagnosis adapted to the clinical practice requirements in LA.",

The goal of this study was to identify factors influencing both safety and efficacy of AHSCT in an older non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) population to better select those who will benefit from this intervention in the Canadian context of a single-payer government healthcare program.This single center, retrospective study, examined clinical outcomes in 90 consecutive older patients (\u226560 years old) with B-cell NHL treated with AHSCT between 2008 and 2014.Median age was 63 (60\u201369) at time of transplantation. The HCT-CI risk score was low, intermediate and high in 34%, 40% and 26% of patients, respectively. NRM was 1% at 100 days and one-year post transplant and not influenced by age. At a median follow-up of 52 months, median progression-free survival (PFS) was 56 months while median overall survival (OS) was still not reached.

To explore the mechanism of difference in pathogenesis and prognosis in different BCR-ABL subtype-related leukemia, expression profile microarray analysis was conducted between p190 and p210 patients and verified by RT-PCR. The p21-activated kinase (PAK1) gene was chosen and regulation of the PAK1-STAT5 biological axis and its influence on proliferation and apoptosis in leukemia cells were also analyzed. The results showed that PAK1 might be an important molecular mechanism of the pathogenic difference between different BCR-ABL subtypes. In P210 (+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), down-regulated PAK1 gene expressions may lead to the suppression of cell proliferation and promotion of apoptosis through phosphorylation of STAT5, with a reverse effect in P190 (+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia(ALL), especially acute B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Additionally, in P210 (+) CML, down-regulated PAK1 expression may enhance the effect of TKI, whereas the reverse is true in P190 (+) B-ALL, demonstrating that PAK1 might also be an important therapeutic target between different BCR-ABL subtypes.",

We also performed targeted sequencing of 88 myeloid-associated genes. A total of 37 patients with ICUS were enrolled in this study, with a median age of 66 years (range: 31\u201383).

     "abstract": "Chemoresistance is an important factor in the treatment failure of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). One underlying mechanism of chemoresistance involves (over)expression of ATP-dependent drug efflux transporters such as multidrug resistance protein 1\u20135 (MRP1\u20135) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), which can extrude the important antileukemia drug methotrexate (MTX). Survival of childhood ALL critically depends on the leukemic blasts' capacity for intracellular retention of MTX and MTX-polyglutamates. This pilot study assessed whether expression of MRP1, MRP4, MRP5 and BCRP (real-time PCR) in primary childhood ALL blasts (n\u2009=\u200923) correlated with ex vivo resistance to MTX (assayed by in situ thymidylate synthase inhibition assay (TSIA)), ex vivo accumulation of (radioactive) MTX polyglutamates, and patient survival. Results show that high MRP4 expression is correlated with ex vivo MTX resistance assayed by TSIA (P\u2009=\u20090.01). Moreover, elevated MRP4 and BCRP expression correlated with lower accumulation of MTX-PGs (P\u2009=\u20090.004 and P\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively). Combined high expression of BCRP and MRP4 even further impacted reduced MTX-PG accumulation (P\u2009=\u20090.02). Overall survival was lower (P logrank\u2009=\u20090.04) in children with ALL cells which featured a relatively high expression of both BCRP and MRP4 transporters. These results underscore the impact of high drug efflux transporter expression, notably MRP4 and BCRP, in diminished MTX response in childhood ALL.",

In a retrospective analysis with 33 patients with hyperleukocytic APL, we found 6 out of 33 hyperleukocytic APL patients presented with thrombosis rather than hemorrhage. A notable feature in these high-risk APL patients with thrombosis is that there were no significant abnormalities in fibrinogen (FIB), prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT). Compared with the normal ranges, both the high-risk APL patients with thrombosis and the high-risk APL patients with hemorrhage had a significant increase in fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) and d-dimer levels. However, the group with hemorrhage had noticeably higher plasma levels of FDP and d-dimer than the group with thrombosis. To find a close relationship between coagulation markers and the onset of thrombotic events in patients with high-risk APL, the potential effects of FDP/FIB and d-dimer/FIB ratios as risk markers were investigated. We demonstrated that FDP/FIB and d-dimer/FIB ratios in the patients with high-risk APL with thrombosis showed higher ratios than the normal range but significantly lower ratios than the patients with high-risk APL-related hemorrhage. Our data demonstrated that the alteration in FDP/FIB and d-dimer/FIB ratios have more significant relevance than the levels of FIB, FDP or d-dimer as potential factors for predicting thrombosis and may help with designing more appropriately risk-adapted treatment protocols or personalized therapy.",

Identification of signaling inhibitors that block their proliferation could reveal the proliferative mechanism of a given leukemia cell, and provide small molecule drugs for targeted therapy for AML. In this study, kinase inhibitors that block the majority of cancer signaling pathways are evaluated for their inhibition of two AML cell lines of the M5 subtypes, CTV-1 and THP-1. While THP-1 cells do not respond to any of these inhibitors, CTV-1 cells are potently inhibited by dasatinib, bosutinib, crizotinib, A-770041, and WH-4-23, all potent inhibitors for Lck, a Src family kinase. CTV-1 cells contain a kinase activity that phosphorylates an Lck-specific peptide substrate in an Lck inhibitor-sensitive manner. Furthermore, the Lck gene is over-expressed in CTV-1, and it contains four mutations, two of which are located in regions critical for Lck negative regulation, and are confirmed to activate Lck. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that mutated and overexpressed Lck is driving CTV-1 proliferation. While Lck activation and overexpression is rare in AML, this study provides a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with a similar oncogenic mechanism.",

Treatment with ponatinib may suppress most of these mutants, including T315I, but is also associated with a high risk of clinically relevant side effects. We screened for alternative treatment options employing available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in combination. Dasatinib and bosutinib are two second-generation TKI that bind to different, albeit partially overlapping, spectra of kinase targets in CML cells. This observation prompted us to explore anti-leukemic effects of the combination dasatinib\u2009+\u2009bosutinib in highly resistant primary CML cells, various CML cell lines (K562, K562R, KU812, KCL22) and Ba/F3 cells harboring various BCR-ABL1 mutant-forms. We found that bosutinib synergizes with dasatinib in inducing growth inhibition and apoptosis in all CML cell lines and in Ba/F3 cells exhibiting BCR-ABL1T315I. Clear synergistic effects were also observed in primary CML cells in all patients tested (n\u2009=\u200920), including drug-resistant cells carrying BCR-ABL1T315I. Moreover, the drug combination produced cooperative or even synergistic apoptosis-inducing effects on CD34+/CD38\u2013 CML stem cells. Finally, we found that the drug combination is a potent approach to block the activity of major additional CML targets, including LYN, KIT and PDGFR\u03b1.

Bmery were quantified in bone marrow smears at the time of diagnosis and were correlated with overall survival (OS) and AML evolution.We identified three distinct risk categories: \"<\u2009=\u200910% bmery\" (poor), \"11\u201325 or >45% bmery\" (intermediate), and \"26\u201345% bmery\" (good) with distinct OS of 23, 40 and 48 months, respectively. The percentage of bmery showed prognostic significance concerning OS (Dxy\u2009=\u20090.08, p\u2009<\u20090.001) and AML-free survival (Dxy\u2009=\u20090.15, p\u2009<\u20090.001). Considering the IPSS-R by stratification, the Dxy were 0.09 for survival, and 0.18 for transformation (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Added to the IPSS-R, bmery enhances the prognostic power for both survival (Dxy\u2009=\u20090.39) and time to AML (Dxy\u2009=\u20090.59).Survival and time to AML differ in MDS according to the percentage of bmery. The best outcome was found in those who had normal or near normal bmery counts. Moreover, adding bmery as differentiating feature to the IPSS-R may enhance its prognostic significance.",

     "abstract": "Tropolones are naturally occurring seven-membered non-benzenoid aromatic compounds that are of interest due to their cytotoxic properties. MO-OH-Nap is a novel \u03b1-substituted tropolone that induces caspase cleavage and upregulates markers associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR) in multiple myeloma (MM) cells. Given previous reports that tropolones may function as iron chelators, we investigated the effects of MO-OH-Nap, as well as the known iron chelator deferoxamine (DFO), in MM cells in the presence or absence of supplemental iron. The ability of MO-OH-Nap to induce apoptosis and upregulate markers of the UPR could be completely prevented by co-incubation with either ferric chloride or ammonium ferrous sulfate. Iron also completely prevented the decrease in BrdU incorporation induced by either DFO or MO-OH-Nap. Ferrozine assays demonstrated that MO-OH-Nap directly chelates iron. Furthermore, MO-OH-Nap upregulates cell surface expression and mRNA levels of transferrin receptor. In vivo studies demonstrate increased Prussian blue staining in hepatosplenic macrophages in MO-OH-Nap-treated mice. These studies demonstrate that MO-OH-Nap-induced cytotoxic effects in MM cells are dependent on the tropolone\u2019s ability to alter cellular iron availability and establish new connections between iron homeostasis and the UPR in MM.",

     "abstract": "Both inhibitory and stimulatory effect of EGCG on cancer cells have been reported, which often is linked to receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. In this study, we present evidence that green tea extract and its chemical component, Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), inhibit growth of human myeloid leukemia cells through the regulation of pRb synthesis and formation of pRb-E2F complexes. Addition of green tea extract to the culture of TF-1a and MV4-11 myeloid leukemia cells significantly inhibited their proliferation with a substantial portion of cell death being observed. The green tea extract and EGCG had no significant effect on the expression of G1 CDKs and the CDK inhibitors but downregulated the formation of pRb-CDKs. Surprisingly, the expression of pRb was markedly upregulated while the phosphorylation of pRb downregulated. The upregulation of pRb was blocked by pre-treatment with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting a requirement of protein synthesis. In agreement with these results, pRb-E2F complexes were upregulated and E2F DNA binding activity decreased. Since both TF-1a and MV4-11 are factor-independent cell lines, the upregulation of pRb-E2F complexes and inhibition of DNA binding activity by green tea extract is most likely through a receptor tyrosine kinase-independent pathway. We also found that the stem/progenitor cells derived from these two leukemia cell lines are more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of green tea extract. Our result suggests that concentrated green tea extract and EGCG may have potential for clinical investigation as an inducer of cancer cell death.",

The ability to predict treatment response based on individual cancer genomics using computational modeling will aid in the development of novel therapeutics and personalize care. Here, we used a combination of genomics, computational biology modeling (CBM), ex vivo chemosensitivity assay, and clinical data from 100 randomly selected patients in the Beat AML project to characterize AML sensitivity to a bromodomain (BRD) and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor. Computational biology modeling was used to generate patient-specific protein network maps of activated and inactivated protein pathways translated from each genomic profile. Digital drug simulations of a BET inhibitor (JQ1) were conducted by quantitatively measuring drug effect using a composite AML disease inhibition score. 93% of predicted disease inhibition scores matched the associated ex vivo IC50 value. Sensitivity and specificity of CBM predictions were 97.67%, and 64.29%, respectively. Genomic predictors of response were identified. Patient samples harbouring chromosomal aberrations del(7q) or -7, +8, or del(5q) and somatic mutations causing ERK pathway dysregulation, responded to JQ1 in both in silico and ex vivo assays. This study shows how a combination of genomics, computational modeling and chemosensitivity testing can identify network signatures associating with treatment response and can inform priority populations for future clinical trials of BET inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "The hypomethylating agent Decitabine (DAC) is a valuable treatment option in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), particularly in elderly patients (pts) not suitable for intensive chemotherapy (CHT). However, limited data are available about efficacy and safety of DAC in clinical practice.We retrospectively reviewed data of 104 AML pts treated with DAC in eight Italian Hematological Centers from 2015 to 2017. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DAC in older AML pts outside of clinical trial. Seventy-five (75%) pts received DAC as first line treatment (Cohort 1) and 29 pts as salvage therapy (Cohort 2). All pts received a DAC schedule of 20\u2009mg/sqm IV for 5-days, every 28 days. The median age was 72.5 years (74 in cohort 1 and 66 in cohort 2) and 16% of pts had an ECOG performance status >2 at the start of DAC treatment (with non-significant difference in the two cohorts). The cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) was > 6 in 27% of pts. Forty-five pts (43%) had secondary AML. Bone marrow blast count was > 30% in 64% of patients (67/104). In the relapsed cohort 17/29 (59%) patients were treated with DAC after conventional CHT, 5/29 (17%) after allo-SCT and 7/29 (24%) after azacitidine therapy.A total of 469 DAC cycles were given to the 104 pts with a median of 3 cycles (range 1\u201321) and 45/104 (43%) pts received > 4 cycles. The Overall Response Rate (ORR\u2009=\u2009Complete Remission-CR plus Partial Remission-PR) was 33%, significantly higher in Cohort 1 (42%) compared to Cohort 2 (14%) (p\u2009=\u20090.009). The median duration of response was 6 months (range 1\u201320). In Cohort 1 the best response (CR or PR) was obtained between 3th and 6th cycle. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, achievement of CR or PR (HR\u2009=\u20090.78; p\u2009=\u20090.0004), CIRS\u2009<\u20096 (HR\u2009=\u20090.9; p\u2009=\u20090.04) and complex karyotype (HR\u2009=\u20090.8; p\u2009=\u20090.03) were significant predictors of better overall survival (OS). Median OS from the start of DAC therapy was 11 months for the whole population with a significant OS advantage in Cohort 1 (median OS 12.7 mths vs 6.3 mths; p\u2009=\u20090.003); median OS was significantly longer in responders compared to non-responders (22.6 mths vs 5.7 mths; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). At the last follow-up, 56 patients (54%) are still alive and 48 (46%) are dead (71% due to disease progression). The most common toxicities were myelosuppression and documented infectious complications that occurred mainly during the first 4 cycles.These data confirm the efficacy (ORR 33%) and the acceptable safety profile of DAC in the real life management of AML in elderly pts unsuitable for intensive CHT, with a significant better performance in first line therapy (ORR 42%, median OS 12.7 mths). The efficacy of DAC, both in first line and as salvage therapy, may probably be improved with combined treatment strategies and/or with different DAC schedules that could increase its anti-leukemic effect.",

In a previous multicenter study we developed protocols to accurately define leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) at diagnosis. It has, however, not been demonstrated whether the use of the defined LAIPs in the same multicenter setting results in a high concordance between centers in MRD assessment. In the present paper we evaluated whether interpretation of list-mode data (LMD) files, obtained from MRD assessment of previously determined LAIPs during and after treatment, could reliably be performed in a multicenter setting. The percentage of MRD positive cells was simultaneously determined in totally 173 LMD files from 77 AML patients by six participating centers. The quantitative concordance between the six participating centers was meanly 84%, with slight variation of 75%\u201389%. In addition our data showed that the type and number of LAIPs were of influence on the performance outcome. The highest concordance was observed for LAIPs with cross-lineage expression, followed by LAIPs with an asynchronous antigen expression. Our results imply that immunophenotypic MRD assessment in AML will only be feasible when fully standardized methods are used for reliable multicenter assessment.",

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia is an aggressive disease that arises from clonal expansion of malignant hematopoietic precursor cells of the bone marrow. Deletions on the long arm of chromosome 9 (del(9q)) are observed in 2% of acute myeloid leukemia patients. Our deletion analysis in a cohort of 31 del(9q) acute myeloid leukemia patients further supports the importance of a minimally deleted region composed of seven genes potentially involved in leukemogenesis: GKAP1, KIF27, C9ORF64, HNRNPK, RMI1, SLC28A3 and NTRK2. Importantly, among them HNRNPK, encoding heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K is proposed to function in leukemogenesis. We show that expression of HNRNPK and the other genes of the minimally deleted region is significantly reduced in patients with del(9q) compared with normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia. Also, two mRNAs interacting with heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, namely CDKN1A and CEBPA are significantly downregulated. While the deletion size is not correlated with outcome, associated genetic aberrations are important. Patients with an additional t(8;21) show a good prognosis. RUNX1-RUNX1T1, which emerges from the t(8;21) leads to transcriptional down-regulation of CEBPA. Acute myeloid leukemia patients with mutations in CEBPA have a good prognosis as well. Interestingly, in del(9q) patients with CEBPA mutation mRNA levels of HNRNPK and the other genes located in the minimally deleted region is restored to normal karyotype level. Our data indicate that a link between CEBPA and the genes of the minimally deleted region, among them HNRNPK contributes to leukemogenesis in acute myeloid leukemia with del(9q).",

Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) \u2013 much more sensitive and quantitative than classical PCR-heteroduplex approaches \u2013 has been introduced for identification of MRD-PCR targets. We evaluated 42 paired diagnosis-relapse samples by NGS (IGH, IGK, TRG, TRD, and TRB) to evaluate clonal evolution patterns and to design an algorithm for selection of antigen receptor gene rearrangements most likely to remain stable at relapse. Overall, only 393 out of 1446 (27%) clonal rearrangements were stable between diagnosis and relapse. If only index clones with a frequency >5% at diagnosis were taken into account, this number increased to 65%; including only index clones with an absolute read count >10,000, indicating truly major clones, further increased the stability to 84%. Over 90% of index clones at relapse were also present as index clone at diagnosis.

In this study, we found that the transcriptional repressor MXD1 showed low expression in CML patients and was negatively correlated with BCR-ABL1. Overexpression of MXD1 markedly inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells and sensitized the imatinib-resistant K562/G01 cell line to imatinib, with decreased BCR-ABL1 mRNA and protein expression. Further investigation using reporter gene analysis showed that MXD1 significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of the BCR-ABL1 gene promoter. Taken together, these data show that MXD1 functions as a negative regulator of BCR-ABL1 expression and subsequently inhibits proliferation and sensitizes CML cells to imatinib treatment.",

In the present study, we showed that MLL+ALL cells expressed CXCR4 and CXCR7, both receptors for the same chemokine stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), but their biological events were differentially regulated by the SDF-1/CXCR4 and SDF-1/CXCR7 axes and particularly exerted an opposite effect for determining chemo-sensitivity of MLL+ALL cells; enhancement via the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis vs. suppression via the SDF-1/CXCR7 axis. Because cytosine-arabinoside-induced apoptosis of MLL+ALL cells was inhibited by pretreatment with the CXCR4 inhibitor but rather accelerated by pretreatment with the CXCR7 inhibitor, an application of the CXCR7 inhibitor may become a good treatment option in future for MLL+ALL patients. MLL+ALL has a unique gene profile distinguishable from other types of ALL and AML, and should be investigated separately in responses to biological active agents including chemokine inhibitors.",

A total of 60 consecutive pathological ALL samples and 8 normal bone marrow samples were included. Associations between TLE1 levels and clinicopathological features were estimated using Mann-Whitney tests.TLE1 mRNA levels were significantly diminished in ALL samples when compared to normal counterparts (fold change -1.45, p-value 0.039). Lower TLE1 expression levels were associated with poorer prognostic features such as age at diagnosis (<1 or >9 years-old), absence of the Common Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Antigen (CALLA) and high white cell count. Considering immunophenotype, decreased expression of TLE1 was only evident for T-cell ALL, what was validated using gene expression profiling data available in public repositories. No associations with event or overall survival were observed. However, TLE1 expression was statistically different between patients who achieved complete clinical remission (CCR) from those that relapsed or died.These data are of particular interest and give support for a plausible role of TLE1 as a tumor suppressor in T-cell ALL. Moreover, the prognostic value of this corepressor may assist ALL treatment stratification and suggest the need of alternative regimens.",

A phase I clinical trial (NCT01702064) investigated the tolerability and safety of treating chronic-phase chronic myeloid leukemia patients with ruxolitinib in combination with the BCR-ABL TKI nilotinib and explored initial efficacy evidence.Eleven patients already treated with single-agent nilotinib (300\u2013400\u2009mg twice daily) commenced combination therapy, and molecular responses were evaluated after 6 months. Three ruxolitinib dose cohorts were studied: 5\u2009mg, 10\u2009mg, and 15\u2009mg twice daily.One patient experienced a grade 3/4 adverse event (hypophosphatemia) and 36% of patients experienced grade 1/2 anemia. Of 10 patients who were evaluable for responses, 40% had undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR after 6 months. Plasma inhibitory assay results revealed a decrease in phospho-STAT3 levels after treatment with ruxolitinib.

     "abstract": "miR-150 functions as a tumor suppressor in malignancies of the lymphocyte lineage and its expression is significantly reduced in these cells. However, the mechanism of miR-150 repression is unknown and so are pharmacological interventions that can reverse it. Here, we report that reduced expression of miR-150 in human Jurkat T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells is mediated by constitutive mTOR signaling, a common characteristic of T-ALL cell lines and clinical isolates. Activating mTOR signaling in non-malignant T cells also resulted in a significant miR-150 down-regulation. Conversely, treatment with a pharmacological mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, increased miR-150 expression in a dose-dependent manner in Jurkat cells, as well as in other leukemia cells. Interestingly, ectopic over-expression of miR-150 acted in a feed-forward loop and further sensitized Jurkat cells to a rapamycin-induced cell cycle arrest by targeting a large network of cell cycle genes. These findings suggest that miR-150 is normally expressed in quiescent T lymphocytes to reinforce an anti-proliferative state, and that mTOR signaling promotes cell proliferation in part by inhibiting miR-150 expression. Restoration of the miR-150-dependent anti-proliferative loop constitutes a novel mechanism underlying the efficacy of rapamycin in a T-ALL cell line. Further investigation of this mechanism in clinical isolates of T-ALL and other hematopoietic malignancies could help better guide development of targeted therapies.",

On the other hand, the chimeric knock-in mouse develops acute megakaryoblastic leukemia. We created another mouse model of RUNX1-EVI1 using transplantation of retrovirus-infected bone marrow cells. Some mice transplanted with RUNX1-EVI1-expressing bone marrow cells developed acute megakaryoblastic leukemia within eight months, and the other non-leukemic mice showed thrombocytosis at around a year. In the non-leukemic mice, dysplastic megakaryocytes proliferated in the bone marrow and frequently infiltrated into the spleen, which was not associated with marrow fibrosis. In the leukemic mice, their tumor cells were positive for c-kit and CD41, and negative for TER119. Although they were negative for platelet peroxidase in the electron microscopic analysis, they had multiple centrioles in the cytoplasm, which are characteristic of megakaryocytes that undergo endomitosis. The leukemic cells were serially transplantable, and gene-expression analyses using quantitative RT-PCR arrays revealed that they showed significantly elevated expression of stem cell, primitive hematopoietic cell and endothelial cell-related genes compared with normal bone marrow cells.

Treatment with 10 \u03bcM I-BET151 significantly induced growth inhibition, apoptosis, and cell cycle modulation, including increases in sub-G1 and G1 phases and decreases in S and G2/M phases, in U937 cells. However, no significant changes in these factors were detected in I-BET151-resistant U937 (U937R) cells. Combined treatment with I-BET151 and IKK inhibitor VII synergistically induced apoptosis in U937 and U937R cells. Increased expression of bromodomain-containing protein (BRD) 2, BRD4, and nuclear NF-\u03baBp65 proteins was detected in U937R cells. IKK inhibitor VII inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baBp65 protein in the nuclear fraction of U937R cells. These findings suggest that resistance to I-BET151 in U937R cells is related to constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway via increased expression of both BRD2 and BRD4.

     "abstract": "Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO), the first antibody-drug conjugate (ADC), has attracted the interest of hematologists because more than 90% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts express its target, CD33. Although GO and subsequently developed ADCs depend on lysosomes for activation, lysosome number and activity in tumor cells has not been well elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether an mTORC1/2 kinase inhibitor, PP242, which was reported to activate lysosomal function, potentiates the cytotoxicity of GO in AML cells. Eight AML cell lines (U937, THP-1, SKM-1, SKK-1, SKNO-1, HL-60, MARIMO and KO52) were treated with GO and PP242. The cytotoxic effect of GO was enhanced by concurrent treatment with a non-cytotoxic concentration (500\u2009nM) of PP242 in most cell lines, except MARIMO and KO52 cells. We then used LysoTracker to label acidic lysosomes in U937, THP-1, SKM-1, MARIMO and KO52 cells. LysoTracker fluorescence was dramatically increased by treatment with PP242 in U937, THP-1 and SKM-1 cells, and the intensified fluorescence was retained with PP242\u2009+\u2009GO. In contrast, PP242 did not induce a significant increase in fluorescence in MARIMO cells, consistent with the lack of combinatory cytotoxicity. LysoTracker fluorescence was also increased by PP242 in KO52 cells, which have been reported to strongly express multidrug resistance (MDR). Further, PP242 suppressed GO-induced Chk1 activation and G2/M cell cycle arrest, which in turn triggered cell cycle promotion and cell death. These results indicate that inhibition of mTORC1/2 kinase by PP242 enhanced the cytotoxicity of GO by increasing lysosomal compartments and promoting the cell cycle via suppression of GO-induced Chk1 activation. This combination may represent an attractive new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of leukemia.",

Retrospective data from 58 patients diagnosed with PTCL-NOS were analyzed. We found that PTCL-NOS patients with lower ALC/AMC ratios (ALC/AMC\u2009<\u20092) had shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) periods (OS: P\u2009<\u20090.001; PFS: P\u2009=\u20090.001) compared with other patients (ALC/AMC\u2009\u2265\u20092). When we combined ALC/AMC ratio and PTCL-U scores, patients could be clearly divided into 3 groups with significantly different prognoses. This study suggests that the ALC/AMC ratio may be a simple, effective, and independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS, and may be helpful to identify high-risk PTCL-NOS patients. Since the ALC/AMC ratio is related to host immunity and tumor microenvironment and reflects immune status and individual differences, combining ALC/AMC with PTCL-U may be a better prognostic guide for PTCL-NOS patients.",

     "abstract": "The diagnosis of many hematologic malignancies has shifted from being based almost exclusively on morphology and clinical data to include ancillary studies such as flow cytometry. This trend has yet to affect the diagnosis of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as flow cytometry, while being integral in the diagnosis of many hematologic malignancies, has no explicit role in the current WHO criteria for CMML. The absence of WHO-determined criteria for flow cytometry in the diagnosis of CMML is not due to a lack of research on the subject over the years. Herein, we review the literature concerning the use of flow cytometry in the diagnosis of CMML, focusing on recent studies showing that CMML can be differentiated from other hematologic malignancies and reactive monocytoses by the quantification of monocyte subsets by flow cytometry with high sensitivity and specificity. We also detail how this methodology could be used clinically, both as a diagnostic test and potentially as a screening test.",

Why is unknown but seems predominately genetic. We observed an increasing frequency of new cases of CLL at our Haematology Centre beginning 2011 and wondered why.Determine the cause(s) for this increased frequency.We interrogated the context of CLL diagnosis in 483 consecutive subjects seen at the Institute of Haematology of a large referral hospital in Beijing. 3 cohorts were considered based on why a CBC was done to establish the CLL diagnosis: (1) a CBC-testing situation unrelated to a health condition such as a routine annual health exam or application for employment or medical insurance (termed routine CBC); (2) an unrelated medical condition such as a cold, influenza, heart disease etc. (termed CBC for other disorders); and (3) signs and/or symptoms consistent with CLL such as lymph-adenopathy, hepato- or splenomegaly, fatigue, B-symptoms etc. (termed CBC for possible CLL).Data regarding context of CLL diagnosis were available for 389 subjects (81%). Proportions of subjects in the 3 cohorts were 44% (95% confidence interval [CI]; 39, 49%), 24% (20, 28%) and 32% (28, 37%). The proportion of subjects whose evaluation of CLL was prompted by an abnormal CBC not for possible CLL (cohorts 1 and 2) increased over the surveillance interval (r\u2009=\u20090.164; P\u2009=\u20090.001) as did median age at diagnosis (r\u2009=\u20090.207; P\u2009<\u20090.001). Age at diagnosis was correlated with probability of CLL being suspected because of an abnormal routine CBC (r\u2009=\u20090.249; P\u2009<\u20090.001); 42% (32, 53%) amongst subjects \u226450 years versus 86% (75, 92%; P\u2009<\u20090.001) among those >70 years.

This analysis was performed to evaluate the efficacy of RM in elderly patients 65\u2009years of age and older and to assess the influence of the induction therapy with immunochemotherapy (R-CHEMO) on the treatment outcome in a real world setting. A total of 232 consecutive patients treated with first-line R-CHEMO and RM (RM1 group; n\u2009=\u2009158) or observation (RM0 group; n\u2009=\u200974) were analyzed. The effect of which induction therapy (R-CHOP vs. R-CVP) and the response of the patients to the first-line therapy were also evaluated.

Several previous studies have suggested such differences between Asian and European/USA countries. In this study, to elucidate potential differences in primary untreated MDS between Japanese (JPN) and Caucasians (CAUC), we analyzed the data from a large international database collected by the International Working Group for Prognosis of MDS (300 and 5838 patients, respectively). JPN MDS were significantly younger with more severe cytopenias, and cytogenetic differences: less del(5q) and more +1/+1q, -1/del(1p), der(1;7), -9/del(9q), del(16q), and del(20q). Although differences in time to acute myeloid leukemia transformation did not occur, a significantly better survival in JPN was demonstrated, even after the adjustment for age and FAB subtypes, especially in lower, but not in higher prognostic risk categories. Certain clinical factors (cytopenias, blast percentage, cytogenetic risk) had different impact on survival and time to transformation to leukemia between the two groups. Although possible confounding events (e.g., environment, diet, and access to care) could not be excluded, our results indicated the existence of clinically relevant ethnic differences regarding survival in MDS between JPN and CAUC patients. The good performance of the IPSS-R in both CAUC and JP patients underlines that its common risk model is adequate for CAUC and JP.",

Several studies have indicated that deregulation of innate immunity signaling is critical in the pathogenesis of MDS. This process involves Toll-like receptor stimulation, cytokine overexpression, and nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation. Since ruxolitinib, a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor, suppresses NF-kB expression, we conducted a phase 1 dose-escalation study to determine the safety and efficacy of ruxolitinib in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation. Nineteen patients, 8 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia and 11 with MDS, were enrolled. No dose limiting toxicity was observed and the maximum tolerated dose was 20\u2009mg twice daily. Responses were restricted to MDS patients with an overall response rate of 22% [hematological improvement in platelets (HI-P)\u2009=\u20092, hematological improvement in erythrocytes (HI-E)\u2009=\u20091, partial cytogenetic response (PCyR)\u2009=\u20091]. Of these patients, 2 relapsed (HI-P and PCyR) and 2 continue to be in HI-P and HI-E, respectively, with ongoing therapy. Meaningful improvement in bone marrow dysplasia was only seen in a patient who achieved HI-E. Phosphorylated p65 (pp65) decreased in 6 of 15 patients (40%) including the 2 patients with continued response to treatment and increased in a patient who relapsed after a short-lived HI-P. This suggests potential correlation between reduction in pp65 expression and response duration. In conclusion, ruxolitinib was well-tolerated in previously treated lower-risk MDS patients with evidence of NF-kB activation and resulted in low but significant frequency of responses.

Additionally, differential methylation patterns were found related to distinct chromosomal aberrations and DIS3 mutations, affecting genes with roles in bone metabolism, cell migration, transcription regulation or DNA damage response. When compared with MM patients, pPCL showed a distinct methylation profile mostly characterized by hypomethylated probes specific for genes involved in several processes like cell adhesion and migration. Furthermore, decreasing methylation levels were evidenced for genes significantly modulated in the progressive phases of plasma cell dyscrasias, from MGUS to MM and pPCL.

Median duration from allo-HCT to relapse was 306 days (range, 76\u20134943). Eighteen patients received DAC\u202f+\u202fDLIs, 8 DAC-only (median number cycles of DAC: 2, range 1\u201313, median number of DLIs: 2, range 1\u201310). The incidence of acute and chronic GvHD in patients receiving DLI was 17% (3/18) and 6% (1/18), respectively. CR/CRi was achieved in 15% (4/26), PR in 4% (1/26), and stable disease in 58% (15/26) of patients. Eight patients received a second allo-HCT. Median overall survival was 4.7 months. Elevated PD-L1 protein expression in bone marrow cells was detected in 4/8 patients with >20% blast infiltration prior to DAC, without a clear association with response. In conclusion, the DAC\u202f+\u202fDLI regimen proved feasible and effective in relapsed myeloid malignancies after allo-HCT, with efficacy not restricted to patients with low leukemic burden.",

A retrospective analysis was performed identifying allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) recipients and donors at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition in Mexico City between May 1999 and August 2017. The final cohort included 113 consecutive patients undergoing allo-HSCT and 110 donors with complete data. Acute GVHD was present in 24% patients. A statistically significant increase in the frequency of aGVHD associated with hypercholesterolemia in the recipients or donors (p\u2009=\u20090.03 and p\u2009=\u20090.008, respectively). Hypercholesterolemia in both, donor and recipient, was also associated with increased aGVHD compared to either patient or donor having hypercholesterolemia or neither (p\u2009=\u20090.002). No statistical significance was observed for other variables. To date, this is the first study associating hypercholesterolemia with aGVHD. According to our results we conclude that hypercholesterolemia in the donor, or in both, the patient and donor, is an independent factor for the development of aGVHD, however, further prospective and larger studies are needed as our results are preliminary.",

The immunophenotyping of CLL and immune cells in peripheral blood was performed on 16 high-risk CLL patients treated with ibrutinib. After early ibrutinib administration, the HLA-DR expression on CLL cells reduced (P\u2009=\u20090.032), accompanied by an increase in CLL cell counts in peripheral blood (P\u2009=\u20090.001).

     "abstract": "Accumulating evidence indicates that the Notch signaling pathway has crucial roles in the control of fate decision and differentiation in numerous cell types. However, the role of Notch signaling in regulating proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells remains controversial. To elucidate this issue, we modulated Notch activity through transducing a constitutively activated form of Notch1 and/or a dominant-negative form of MAML1 (DNMAML1) into myeloid progenitor 32D cells and assessed their effects on cell proliferation and differentiation. We found that Notch1 activation enhances proliferation and delays granulocytic differentiation of 32D cells. The enhanced proliferation due to activated Notch1 signaling was associated with upregulation of c-Myc, followed by decreased expression of p21 and p27, and increased cdc2 kinase activity, through a mechanism that was not blocked by DNMAML1. Conversely, Notch1 activation significantly delayed granulocytic differentiation and maintained a part of myeloid progenitor cells in an immature stage, and this Notch1-mediated effect was dependent on MAML. The Notch1-induced effects on mye myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation were likely mediated by induction of c-Myc and repression of PU.1, respectively. Thus, Notch1 signaling plays an important part in modulating proliferation and differentiation in MAML-independent and -dependent manners and promoting expansion of myeloid progenitors.",

In the process, we have identified a microtubule inhibitor, cabazitaxel (CAB), and a RNA synthesis inhibitor, plicamycin (PLI) as potential anti-leukemic agents. CAB and PLI inhibited cell proliferation in not only the BCL6 knockdown REH cell line, but also six other ALL cell lines. Furthermore, combination of CAB and PLI had a synergistic effect in inhibiting proliferation in a cytarabine-resistant (REH/Ara-C) ALL cell line. Use of nanoparticles for delivery of CAB and PLI demonstrated that the combination was very effective when tested in a co-culture model that mimics the in vivo bone marrow microenvironment that typically supports ALL cell survival and migration into protective niches. Furthermore, exposure to PLI inhibited SOX2 transcription and exposure to CAB inhibited not only Mcl-1 expression but also chemotaxis in ALL cells.

     "abstract": "Melanoma is significantly more common and is associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with an underlying B-cell malignancy. This study reports on the management of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL) and a subsequent diagnosis of melanoma. In the Wilmot Cancer Institute CLL cohort, which includes 470 patients followed for 2849 person-years, 18 patients (3.8%) developed 22 melanomas. Fourteen melanomas were invasive, a significantly higher rate as compared with the age and sex matched general population (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] 6.32 (95% CI 3.45; 10.60). Melanomas were most often detected (n\u202f=\u202f15; 68.2%) through active surveillance in a dermatology clinic. Most melanomas (n\u202f=\u202f17; 77.3%) were detected at a non-advanced stage (pathological stage grouping\u202f<\u202fIII). The most common management was wide local excision without sentinel lymph node biopsy (n\u202f=\u202f13, 59.1%). Management for the 4 (18.2%) patients with metastatic disease included the immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab (n\u202f=\u202f1), systemic chemotherapy with dacarbazine (n\u202f=\u202f1), and palliative care (n\u202f=\u202f2). The patient treated with ICI is in sustained remission of her melanoma after 23 cycles of therapy while her TP53 disrupted CLL continues to respond to ibrutinib therapy. We conclude that patients with CLL may benefit from active surveillance for melanoma leading to early excision of locally-manageable disease. In patients with metastatic melanoma, combined treatment with targeted kinase inhibitors and ICIs can be successful and tolerable. Larger prospective studies should be considered to further evaluate these approaches.",

Expert laboratories use flow cytometry (FCM) to help diagnose MDS. However, most of FCM protocols for MDS are complex, requiring a high level of expertise and high cost. We have reported a FCM mini-panel consisting of four FCM parameters (so-called Ogata score), which is simple to conduct and inexpensive. In this paper, to refine this mini-panel, we have introduced a new FCM parameter, which quantifies CD33 expression on CD34+ cells (called Granulocyte/CD34 cell CD33 ratio). Bone marrow cells from MDS without blast excess (low-grade MDS) and controls were stained with CD34, CD45, and CD33 and analyzed for five parameters (\u201cGranulocyte/CD34 cell CD33 ratio\u201d plus four parameters in the Ogata score). By a multivariate logistic regression model, only three parameters, including \u201cGranulocyte/CD34 cell CD33 ratio\u201d had statistically significant power for diagnosing low-grade MDS. Based on the results, we constructed a new scoring system, which showed approximately 50% sensitivity and more than 95% specificity in diagnosing low-grade MDS. Our revised mini-panel is suitable for screening samples suspected for MDS and provides a basis for further improvement in diagnostic FCM protocols for MDS.",

As lymphoblasts have to overcome the physiological blood-CNS barriers to enter the CNS, we investigated the cellular interactions of lymphoblasts with the choroid plexus (CP) epithelium of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB).Both a precurser B cell ALL (pB-ALL) cell line (SD-1) and a T cell ALL (T-ALL) cell line (P12-Ishikawa) were able to actively cross the CP epithelium in a human in vitro model. We could illustrate a transcellular and (supposedly) paracellular transmigration by 3-dimensional immunofluorescence microscopy as well as electron microscopy. Chemotactic stimulation with CXCL12 during this process led to a significantly increased transmigration and blocking CXCL12/CXCR4-signaling by the CXCR4-inhibitor AMD3100 inhibited this effect. However, CXCR4 expression in primary ALL samples did not correlate to CNS disease, indicating that CXCR4-driven CNS invasion across the BCSFB might be a general property of pediatric ALL.Notably, we present a unique in vitro BCSFB model suitable to study CNS invasion of lymphoblasts in a human setting, providing the opportunity to investigate experimental variables, which may determine CNS disease childhood ALL.",

We determined the incidence and intensity of expression of BCMA in bone marrow PCM cells using flow cytometry (FC) and immunohistochemistry (IHC).PCM BCMA expression was assessed by FC in 70 patients and in 43 concurrent specimens by IHC. BCMA expression was detected in 94% of patients. FC could assess BCMA expression in all specimens and expression was quantifiable (QuantiBRITE system, BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in 89% of cases. Expression was highly variable and could be numerically classified into dim, moderate or bright levels of expression. In the 43 specimens assessed successfully by both IHC and FC, FC showed higher positivity rate (97%) than IHC (72%), indicating that FC is more useful than IHC in detection of BCMA (p\u202f=\u202f0.002; McNemar\u2019s test).We conclude that FC is more sensitive than IHC and can be used to objectively quantify BCMA expression by myeloma cells. IHC is primarily useful when there is significant infiltration of the bone marrow by myeloma and is less sensitive with low numbers of myeloma cells. Furthermore, the ability of FC to differentiate between normal and abnormal plasma cells and to quantify BCMA on these cells, makes it a useful and sensitive tool in screening patients for CAR T-cell therapy and for follow-up post therapy.",

Nine patients were randomized to receive only a standard antimicrobial prophylaxis; whereas, nine patients received in addition 150\u202fmg/day of zinc from day +5 to day +100 after transplant.CD4+ na\u00efve lymphocytes and TRECs showed a significant increase from day +30 until day +100 only in the zinc-treated group. Moreover, the load of Torquetenovirus, a harmless virus that replicates in course of immunedepression, increased at day +100 only in the control group. No severe adverse events were reported during the zinc consumption.First data from the ZENITH trial suggest that high-dose zinc supplementation is safe and may enhance the thymic reconstitution after HSCT.

Phosphorylation in lymphocytes is tightly associated with regulation of protein activities, functional regulation and cell signaling, and may thus affect initiation and/or progression of the disease. Here we report changes in the phosphorylation of CD23 on threonine (pThr314) and two serine residues (pSer254, pSer265) in B lymphocytes of B-CLL patients, using a flow cytometry approach. The majority of tested patients with active forms of B-CLL presented a notable overexpression of CD23 along with pThr314, pSer254, and pSer265 CD23 phosphorylation positivity. Moreover, we have experimentally stimulated the CD23 phosphorylations in a subset of peripheral blood lymphocytes of healthy controls by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate treatment. This affects the activation of competent phosphorylation mediating kinases, resulting in the enhanced phosphorylation pattern. Together, these data confirm that CD23 protein is phosphorylated in B cells of B-CLL patients, report the identification of new CD23 phosphorylation sites, and suggest a possible role(s) of such phosphorylations in the activation of CD23 during the process of lymphocytic activation in B-CLL.",

Forty mice were randomly distributed into two groups, the control group and the TBI group, with 20 mice in each. Using circRNA microarray data, we compared the circRNA expression profiles in the MSCs between the two groups. Randomly chosen differentially expressed circRNAs were validated as potential TBI biomarkers. Overall, 148 circRNAs were significantly upregulated while the other 133 were downregulated between the TBI group and the sham group. Among them, two upregulated circRNAs (mmu_circRNA_011235 and mmu_circRNA_016901) and three downregulated circRNAs (mmu_circRNA_008488, mmu_circRNA_000551 and mmu_circRNA_005365) exhibited trends comparable to microarray data in the validation experiments.

In the present study, we screened the antimalarial drugs, mefloquine, atovaquone, primaquine, and tafenoquine, for their effects on lysosome disruption and cytotoxicity in primary CLL cells. We found that mefloquine and tafenoquine could permeabilize lysosome membranes and induce cell death at doses that are clinically achievable. In contrast, these agents had less effect on normal B cells. Tafenoquine was most effective at inducing cell death, and this was associated with increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation. Addition of ROS scavengers blocked both tafenoquine- and mefloquine-induced cell death. Moreover, blocking the activity of cathepsins released from the lysosomes decreased tafenoquine-induced cell death.

Response, meaning transfusion independence (TI) lasting\u202f\u2265\u202feight weeks, was achieved in 38 (90%) of analyzed patients with del(5q), of whom three achieved TI only by adding erythropoietin\u202f\u00b1\u202fprednisone. Another five patients responded well to this combination when their anemia relapsed later during the treatment. In the non-del(5q) group only one patient with RARS-T reached TI. Cytogenetic response was reached in 64% (32% complete, 32% partial response). The TP53 mutation was detected in 7 (18%) patients; four patients progressed to higher grade MDS or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). All seven RAEB-1 patients cleared bone marrow blasts during lenalidomide treatment and reached complete remission (CR); however, three later progressed to higher grade MDS or AML. Lenalidomide represents effective treatment for del(5q) group and combination with prednisone and erythropoietin may be used for non-responders or therapy failures.",

Studies indicate a close relationship between bone metabolism and hematopoietic stem cells within the osteo-hematopoietic niche. However, it remains unclear how the disturbed interaction within the osteo-hematopoietic niche affects bone homeostasis in MDS and AML patients.We utilized data of a large German statutory health insurance of approximately 2 million persons living in the German federal state of Saxony. Applying case definitions based on diagnosis, procedures and prescriptions we identified prevalent and incident cases with MDS, AML and osteoporosis (OSP) in persons aged \u226560 years. We applied time-to-event analyses to determine the relationship of MDS and AML with OSP with a specific focus on temporality.Among all individuals aged \u226560 years (n\u202f=\u202f891,095), 2.62% (n\u202f=\u202f23,326), 0.14% (n\u202f=\u202f1219) and 0.10% (n\u202f=\u202f893) were identified with incident OSP, MDS and AML, respectively. The risk of incident OSP was significantly increased in patients with prevalent MDS (sex and age-adjusted model: HR\u202f=\u202f1.87, 95%CI: 1.51\u20132.23). Conversely, patients with prevalent OSP had an increased risk to be diagnosed with incident MDS in the adjusted model (HR\u202f=\u202f1.42, 1.19\u20131.65). For AML no significant associations were observed (adjusted models: inc. OSP with pre. AML; HR\u202f=\u202f1.06, 0.65\u20131.47; inc. AML with pre. OSP; HR\u202f=\u202f0.82, 0.41\u20131.23).Our results could indicate a clinically relevant relationship between MDS and OSP in elderly patients, most likely resulting from a disturbed microenvironment within the osteo-hematopoietic niche. An alternative, non-causal explanation that MDS is caused by the medication prescribed for OSP can be partially ruled out, as the association between the two diseases remains if incident OSP cases are considered in patients with pre-existing MDS. These results need to be confirmed within other prospective studies and may allow then for comprehensive strategies for the prevention, early detection and clinical care of patients with MDS and OSP.",

Indeed, CML is now associated with near-normal life expectancy for the majority of patients, provided they adhere to lifelong TKI-based treatment. This paradigm, in which CML can be regarded as a chronic disease, has inherent consequences on the prevalence of the disease. Our objective was to study CML prevalence trend in the French population from 1960 to 2060.We used a cohort component-based model to forecast the prevalence of CML using projections of the French population, the estimated incidence rates by age and sex, and various hypotheses on the year-specific relative survival.CML prevalence in France is estimated at 2.5 per 100,000 inhabitants before the 1980s, with a progression up to 6 by 2002. Since 2002 this trend has increased further, with current and predicted prevalence reaching levels around 18 and 24 per 100,000 in 2018 and 2030 respectively. CML prevalence reaches 30 per 100,000 by 2050 when progression slows. Our simulations show that prevalence of CML is driven by both population aging and relative survival improvement.

We now show that although the intracellular cytoplasmic tail (CD200C-tail) of CD200 has no consensus sites for adapter molecules which might signal the CD200+ cell directly, cleavage of the CD200C-tail from the membrane region of CD200 by a consensus \u03b3-secretase, leads to nuclear translocation and DNA binding (identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing, Chip-sequencing) of the CD200C-tail.

Altered expression of these TFs was also prominent following transfection of CD200+ B cell lines and fresh patient CLL cells with a vector construct containing the CD200C-tail. Artificial transfection of non CD200+ Hek293 cells with this CD200C-tail construct resulted in altered expression of most of these same genes.

C-KIT mutations are often found as single point mutations. However, the rate of double mutations has recently increased in AML patients. In this study, we detected six cases (18.8%) harboring double C-KIT exon17 mutations in 75 patients with CBF-AML. The clone composition and dynamic evolution were analyzed by sequencing and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). Results revealed that these double mutations can be occurred in either the same or different clones. Different clones of double mutations may result in different sensitivity to the treatment of CBF-AML. The clones with N822 mutation responded better to treatment as compared to those with D816 mutation. Moreover, D816 clone was readily transformed into a predominant clone at relapse. Meanwhile, the predominant clones in the same patient may change during the progression of disease. The emerging mutation can originate from a small quantity of clones at diagnosis or newly acquired during the course of disease. Furthermore, patients with double mutations had better overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) than those with single mutation, but the differences did not reach statistical significance (P\u202f>\u202f0.05).

We show that following stimulation of CLL cells with Phorbol myristic acetate, IL-2, the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (P2I) and ionomycin (P2Iio), markedly increased expression of CD54 and CD83 was seen, indicative of B cell activation and a transition to antigen-presenting cells. However, this occurred in the context of augmented expression of the known immunoregulatory molecule, CD200. Accordingly we explored the effect of stimulation of CLL cells with P2Iio, followed by coating of cells with a non-depleting anti-CD200mAb, on the ability of those cells to immunize PBL in vitro to become cytotoxic to CLL cells, or to protect NOD-SCID\u03b3cnull (NSG) mice from subsequent CLL tumor challenge. Our data indicate that this protocol is effective in inducing CD8+ CTL able to lyse CLL cells in vitro, and decrease tumor burden in vivo in spleen and marrow of mice injected with CLL cells. Pre-treatment of mice with a CD8 depleting antibody before vaccination with P2Iio/anti-CD200 coated cells abolished any protection seen.

Given the paucity of available data, the aim of our study was to determine the incidence of typhlitis among AML patients receiving induction chemotherapy with idarubicin 12\u202fmg/m2 (IDA), daunorubicin 60\u202fmg/m2 (DNA60), or daunorubicin 90\u202fmg/m2 (DNA90).Adult patients with AML or MDS receiving either daunorubicin or idarubicin along with cytarabine as part of their induction regimen between January 1, 2009 and June 30, 2013 were included. A definition of typhlitis required CT confirmation of inflammation of the cecum only, defined as non-tumoral bowel wall thickening with or without pericolonic fat infiltration and fluid, according to CTCAE version 4.03 along with clinical symptoms. The primary endpoint was to determine the incidence of typhlitis among IDA, DNA60, and DNA90. Secondary endpoints included characterizing the variability of doses used in induction therapy and identifying any potential risk factors for the development of typhlitis.The overall incidence of typhlitis was 2.5%. When the definition was broadened to include the colitis, enteritis, or enterocolitis, the incidence increased. The inter-reliability ratings of the 2 radiologists\u2019 evaluations for each definition indicated substantial agreement (0.803 cecum, 0.834 ileocecal region only, and 0.752 enterocolitis). Neither the anthracycline chosen, nor the dose had a statistically significant impact on the incidence of typhlitis. In patients that developed typhlitis, all patients had clinical symptoms in addition to documented cecum inflammation on CT scan. All patients were managed conservatively with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics.To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the incidence of typhlitis in adult patients receiving idarubicin or daunorubicin for the treatment of AML. The cumulative incidence of typhlitis was similar to the currently published literature, with the incidence being similar irrespective of the anthracycline chosen or dose. All patients were managed conservatively with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Fifty-three patients showing persistent leukemia on interim bone marrow examination received a second course of induction chemotherapy comprising 2\u202fdays of daunorubicin (45\u202fmg/m2/d) or IDA (8 or 12\u202fmg/m2/d) in addition to 5\u202fdays of cytarabine.

Overall, 86 of 155 (55.5%) cases showed phenotype shifts at least one marker. CD19 was the most stable markers. By contrast, CD20 was significantly different between diagnosis and day 33 in nearly one third of the cases. Shifts of antigen expression was not significantly associated with EFS, RFS or OS (P\u202f>\u202f0.05).

Blockade of the CD95 system can improve erythropoiesis in MDS. Asunercept (APG101) is a fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of human CD95 and the Fc domain of human IgG1 blocking the interaction between CD95 and its ligand. Here we report on results from a phase I study in 20 transfusion-dependent low and intermediate risk MDS patients treated with intravenous asunercept (EudraCT 2012-003027-37). Primary objectives were safety and tolerability as well as pharmacodynamic effects. Secondary objectives were hematologic improvement, incidence and time to leukemic progression as well as overall survival. Frequency and severity of adverse events were in range of what could be expected in a patient cohort comprising of elderly MDS patients. Two patients experienced a serious adverse event with a suspected relationship to asunercept. The incidence of disease progression was low. In the 20 patients a decrease of the transfusion need from a mean of 10,8 (\u00b15,1) pRBCs during the 12 weeks treatment phase to a mean of 10,0 (\u00b14,2) pRBCs at the end of the study was observed. In conclusion, asunercept was well tolerated and showed efficacy in transfusion-dependent low and intermediate risk MDS patients. Further clinical investigation is warranted, particularly in combination with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs).",

However, they can be overlooked when conventional analysis or multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) is used to detect complex karyotypes. We analyzed the karyotypes of 114 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and complex karyotypes and verified the presence of monosomies by FISH using multi-centromeric probes. Monosomy was detected in 63% of patients by G-banding/mFISH and confirmed in 55% of patients by centromeric FISH. FISH analysis indicated a high frequency of DCs that were previously considered monosomies. In some cases, it was apparent that the derivative monocentric chromosome was a primary DC. DCs were formed mostly by chromosomes 17 and 20. In conclusion, chromosome loss and unbalanced translocation suggest the presence of a hidden DC or its previous existence. DCs undergo several stabilizing changes and can induce other chromosomal aberrations and/or the formation of new DCs. This can result in the clonal evolution of abnormal cells, which is considered an independent prognostic marker of an unfavorable disease course and short survival.",

ZFP36L2 was one of the up-regulated genes in Kasumi-1 cells induced by PB treatment. In this study, ZFP36L2 was found to express at a lower level in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with t(8;21) compared to AML patients without t(8;21). In order to investigate the correlation between the expression of ZFP36L2 and AML1 or AML1-ETO, the putative AML1 binding sites in the enhancer/promoter region of ZFP36L2 gene were predicted through the bioinformatics analysis. And the biological function of ZFP36L2 in leukemic cells was further investigated. The results demonstrated that AML1 could transactivate ZFP36L2 significantly by binding on specific site of the ZFP36L2 promoter sequence. And overexpression of ZFP36L2 in leukemia cells could inhibit the cell proliferation, promote cell-cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and induce the cell apoptosis. In conclusion, ZFP36L2 could be transactivated by AML1, which subsequently induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis of leukemia cells.",

Moreover, a number of studies have demonstrated that anti CD44 monoclonal antibody (mAb) induces to bring back differentiation blockage the leukemic stem cells. The level of differentiation markers including CD11b and CD11c in NB4 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. The induction of apoptosis was also evaluated. We estimated the induction potential of a triple compound of ATRA-FICZ, anti-CD44 maps. The cells showed the gradually increased expression levels of CD11b and CD11c. A mixture of a \u201cCD44 mAb, ATRA and FICZ effectively promoted granulocytic maturation resulting in increased rates of apoptosis. The differences in expression of CD11b and CD11c at 5\u202f\u03bcg/ml and 10\u202f\u03bcg/ml were significant. These phenomena were highest at 10\u202f\u03bcg/ml CD44 mAb concentrations.

Among different epigenetic modifiers, lysine specific demethylases have been noticed as potential therapeutic targets. KDM5 family of histone demethylases which removes methyl marks from lysine residues of H3, are frequently found in the promoter region of transcriptionally active genes resulting in repression of expression. Here we have compared the effects of KDM5A and KDM5B downregulation on HL-60 cell line behavior. KDM5A/5B knockdown resulted in lower viability of HL-60 cells in addition to modified cell cycle distribution and sub-G1 accumulation. Induction of apoptosis was observed in both knockdown cells. But in spite of similarity in their role, downregulation of KDM5A showed more efficient anti-leukemic effects in comparison to KDM5B. Cells showed higher accumulation in sub-G1 and apoptosis occurred significantly higher and also earlier after KDM5A reduction. Expression analysis confirmed almost 5 and 4 fold increased expression for bax and caspase-3 after downregulation of KDM5A in comparison to KDM5B.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells are maintained at immature state by differentiation blockade, which involves deregulation of transcription factors in myeloid differentiation. AML cells can be induced to differentiate by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), which possesses pro-oxidative activity. However, the signaling events mediated by ROS in the activation of transcriptional program during AML differentiation has not been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated AML cell differentiation by treatment with PMA and ROS scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). We observed elevation of intracellular ROS level in the PMA-treated AML cells, which correlated with differentiated cell morphology and increased CD11b+ mature cell population. The effect of PMA can be abolished by NAC co-treatment, supporting the involvement of ROS in the process. Moreover, we demonstrated that short ROS elevation mediated cell cycle arrest, but failed to activate myeloid gene transcription; whereas prolonged ROS elevation activated JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway. Inhibition of JNK suppressed the expression of key myeloid transcriptional regulators c-JUN, SPI-1 and MAFB, and prevented AML cells from undergoing terminal differentiation. These findings provide new insights into the crucial role of JNK/c-Jun signaling pathway in the activation of transcriptional program during ROS-mediated AML differentiation.",

The expression of CD25 on HSC in high-risk MDS group (53.27%) based on IPSS score was significantly higher than that in low-risk MDS group (18.66%, P\u202f=\u202f0.003). In MDS patients, CD25+ HSC were negatively correlated with the counts of neutrophils (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.684, P\u202f=\u202f0.002) and platelets (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.561, P\u202f=\u202f0.015), while positively correlated with the percentage of blasts in bone marrow (r\u202f=\u202f0.596, P\u202f=\u202f0.009). The CD25 expression on erythroblasts had a significant positive correlation with red blood cell counts in MDS patients (r\u202f=\u202f0.536, P\u202f=\u202f0.012).CD25 was over-expressed on HSC in MDS patients, especially in high-risk MDS patients. Increased CD25+ HSC was correlated with progression of MDS. Low-expression of CD25 on erythroblasts might correlate with anemia in MDS patients. CD25 could be a specific marker of LSC in MDS, and could involve in the mechanisms of development and progression of MDS.",

A Phase 2 study of high dose pravastatin given in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine demonstrated an impressive response rate [75% complete remission (CR), CR with incomplete count recovery (CRi)]. However, this population was a favorable risk group as eligible patients had to have a CR/CRi lasting \u22653 months following their most recent chemotherapy. Therefore, the study was amended to treat patients with poor risk disease including those with CR/CRi <6\u202fmonths following their last induction regimen or with refractory disease. Here, we present results in this poor risk group. This trial included a significant number of patients with poor risk cytogenetics (43%) and poor risk molecular mutations. The response rate was 30% and approximately one-fourth of patients were able to proceed to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). The median overall survival for patients proceeding to allogeneic HSCT is 27.1 months. Although this trial did not meet criteria for a positive study based on the response rate (p\u202f=\u202f.062), these results are encouraging given the poor risk population and suggest that targeting the cholesterol pathway may have therapeutic benefit in AML.",

We retrospectively analyzed laboratory and clinical data of 101 patients (59 patients was refractory anemia (RA) according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification).

Our results demonstrated that patients with pre-B ALL had a higher percentage of Helios+ FoxP3+ CD4+ Tregs. And there was a positive correlation between the expression of Helios and the suppressive function of Tregs, the risk gradation of ALL. Helios in combination with CD4 and FoxP3 may be an effective way to detect functional Tregs in pre-B ALL by promoting the secretion of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21. Furthermore, Helios+ Tregs could regulate angiogenesis in the BM niche of pre-B ALL via the VEGFA/VEGFR2 pathway. We also found Helios+ Tregs decreased apoptosis rate of nalm-6 cells by up-regulating the expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2.

FZD1 knockdown significantly reduced MDR1 expression through the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, disrupted the P-gp efflux function, induced the recovery of sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents, and hindered cell proliferation in cell lines. FZD1 expression in leukemic cells was significantly higher in patients experiencing relapse (n\u202f=\u202f34) than in those with no relapse (n\u202f=\u202f44, P\u202f=\u202f.003). Leukemic cells unable to achieve complete response (CR) showed an increased expression of MDR1 and P-gp, compared to patients who achieved CR. Obtaining CR in patients with higher FZD1 expression at diagnosis is difficult. Moreover, they tend to present instances of relapse, suggesting that AML cells with increased FZD1 expression are resistant to chemotherapy. We conclude that the activated FZD1 observed in leukemic cells likely confers acquired drug resistance, whereas FZD1 silencing may be more effective in reversing MDR.",

However, little is known whether low-dose Vitamin C has a synergistic effect with decitabine in clinic.The effect of combined low-dose Vitamin C and decitabine on cell proliferation, the cell cycle, apoptosis and the expression level and activity of TET2 was investigated in HL60 and NB4 human leukemic cells. Additionally, we analyzed the clinical outcomes of 73 elderly AML patients who received A-DCAG (intravenous Vitamin C [IVC] plus DCAG [n\u202f=\u202f39]) or DCAG (n\u202f=\u202f34) treatment.We found that low-dose Vitamin C and decitabine has a synergistic efficacy on proliferation, apoptosis, TET2 expression and activity, compared to drug\u2013alone treatment in HL60 and NB4 cell lines in vitro. In clinic, feasibility and safety evaluations revealed that patients who received A-DCAG regimen have a higher complete remission (CR) rate than those who received the DCAG regimen (79.92% vs. 44.11%; P\u202f=\u202f0.004) after one cycle of chemotherapy. The median overall survival (OS) was better in the A-DCAG group compared with the DCAG group (15.3 months vs. 9.3 months, P\u202f=\u202f0.039). Patients with adverse cytogenetics did benefit from CR. There was no clinically significant additional toxicity observed with the addition of IVC.On the basis of these results, the addition of IVC at low doses to DCAG appeared to improve CR and prolong OS, compared with DCAG, in elderly patients with AML.",

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable hematologic neoplasm, has highly variable course and its heterogeneity prompts interest in exploring autophagic trajectories in CLL.

One hundred and six patients with CLL and fifty healthy controls were enrolled in the present study. CLL samples were found higher expression levels of BECN1 and ATG5 mRNA compared with healthy controls. Further confirmation at the protein level performed in a small cohort of patients, which included Beclin1, ATG5 and LC3-II showed the same trend. What\u2019s more, high expression at the mRNA level correlated with early Binet stage, isolated 13q deletion and negative CD38, which were associated with favor prognosis, suggesting that autophagy differs in CLL due to the presence of heterogeneity and high levels of these two genes may reflect better outcomes. Survival analysis did show patients with high expression of ATG5 mRNA had longer treatment free survival from the date of sampling.",

We validated the long-term prognosis and clinical characteristics of each ELN-2017 risk category in Japanese adult AML patients who were treated in the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) AML-201 study. We demonstrated that the 3-risk category system of the ELN-2017 successfully discriminated the overall survival and complete remission rates in our cohort in comparison with the 4-risk category of the ELN-2010. However, there were still genetic categories in which stratification of patients into favorable or intermediate risk categories was controversial; the low allelic ratio of FLT3-ITD was not necessarily associated with a better prognosis in patients with FLT3-ITD, and cytogenetic abnormalities may affect the prognosis in patients with favorable genetic lesions such as NPM1 and CEBPA mutations. As many molecular targeting agents, such as FLT3 inhibitors, have been developed, we must continue to modify the genetic risk stratification system to match the progression of therapeutic strategies.",

The cumulative deep molecular response (DMR, MR4) rate was 65% by 36 months; the 3-year overall survival was 96%. CD4+ T cell counts were stable, whereas the proportion of CD4+CD25+CD127low (Treg) cells decreased in a time-dependent manner. The DMR rate by18 months was significantly better in low Treg patients (<5.7% at 12 months) compared to the remaining patients (odds ratio 4.07).

Here, we examined the relationship between EDG2 and NM23 expression during myeloid differentiation of leukemia cells. NM23 expression decreased and EDG2 expression increased during all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced myeloid differentiation of HL-60, NB4, and THP-1 leukemia cells. Moreover, this inverse correlation was more evident when myeloid differentiation was enhanced by ellagic acid, an inhibitor of NM23 activity. In contrast, there was no inverse correlation between EDG2 and NM23 expression during erythroid differentiation of HEL and K562 cells. ATRA plus LPA enhanced the motility of leukemia cells as well as breast cancer cells in an EDG2-dependent manner.

Nevertheless, when the same cells overexpress anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein, Bcl-xL (HF28Bcl-xL), they become resistant to TRAIL. Thus, these cell lines help us to investigate the action of novel apoptosis inducing candidate drugs. In the present study, we examined the effects of MG-132 (a proteasome inhibitor), LiCl (a glycogen synthase kinase-3 inhibitor) and/or TRAIL on pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bim and Bid. Here we demonstrate that the combination of MG-132 and TRAIL induced significant apoptotic cell death in both cell lines, HF28GFP and HF28BclxL. Apoptosis correlated with a decrease of phospho-ERK1/2, the accumulation of Bim and translocation of truncated Bid (tBid) and jBid. In addition, the combination of MG-132 and TRAIL seemed to target other apoptotic factors, which led to the accumulation of active capsase-3. Furthermore, co-stimulation of LiCl and TRAIL induced apoptosis in HF28GFP cells. However, HF28Bcl-xL cells were far less sensitive to the combinatorial effects of LiCl and TRAIL. Interestingly, we observed that LiCl did not target Bim and Bid proteins. In conclusion, these data show that targeting of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins simultaneously through a selective proteasome inhibition might help to overcome TRAIL resistance caused by overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Moreover, the data may provide new strategies to develop targeted therapies against lymphomas.",

Inv(3)(q21q26.2) was most common, identified in 7(58%) patients, followed by t(3;21)(q26.2;q22) in 2 patients and 1 patient each with t(3;3)(q21;q26.2), t(2;3)(p21;q26-27), and t(3;6)(q26.2;q26). Six (50%) patients had 3q26.2 rearrangements as a sole cytogenetic abnormality and 6 (50%) patients had additional cytogenetic abnormalities. Molecular studies revealed DNMT3A mutations in all 3 patients assessed and RAS mutations in 2 of 8 (25%) patients. No mutations in ASXL1 (n\u202f=\u202f3), TET2 (n\u202f=\u202f3), FLT3 ITD/D835 (n\u202f=\u202f10), and CEBPA (n\u202f=\u202f7) were detected. Most patients received hypomethylating agent based chemotherapy. The median follow-up was 11.5 months (range, 1.5\u201324 months) and at time of last follow-up, 11 (92%) died with a median survival of 13.4 months (range, 1.5\u201324 months). The only patient alive had a relatively short follow-up of 2.4 months and showed disease progression at the last visit. In conclusion, 3q26.2/EVI1 rearrangements are a rare event and usually present at time of initial diagnosis in MDS/MPN. The presence of 3q26.2/EVI1 rearrangements in MDS/MPN is associated with rapid disease progression, poor response to treatment, and a poor prognosis.",

The present study examines the impact of perforin gene variation on the clinical outcome in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. The study enrolled 312 children aged 1\u201318 years, treated for ALL. PRF1 gene variants were analyzed through direct DNA sequencing. Variation in rs885822 was found to be associated with overall survival: patients carrying the GG genotype demonstrated a significantly increased risk of death compared to those carrying the A allele, independently of ALL risk groups (HR 3.13, 95%CI 1.16\u20137.8, p\u202f=\u202f0.014). The effect was even more pronounced in high-risk ALL patients (p\u202f=\u202f0.006). On the other hand, the presence of the rs35947132 minor A allele was slightly protective with regard to overall prognosis (p\u202f=\u202f0.047). No differences in relapse-free survival were observed with regard to genotypes. The results of the study may imply that perforin gene variation has a role in modifying mortality in childhood ALL.",

Characterization of CALR mutations and detection of MPL mutations were performed by Sanger sequencing.Twelve novel CALR mutations have been identified. ET patients with CALRmut load exceeding the median value exhibited lower hemoglobin values (12.0 vs. 13.6\u202fg/dL), higher LDH levels (510 vs. 351 IU/L) and higher rate of myelofibrotic transformation (19% vs. 5%). The CALRmut load was higher among ET patients presenting with splenomegaly compared to those without splenomegaly (50.0% vs. 43.5%).Our study confirms the clinical significance of driver mutational status and JAK2mut load in MPNs; in addition, unravels a novel clinical association between high CALRmut load and a more proliferative phenotype in ET.",

Although these AMLs are categorized as favorable risk by NCCN, clinical experience suggests that there are differences in clinical outcome amongst these cytogenetically and molecularly distinct leukemias. This study compared clinical and genotypic characteristics of 60 patients with favorable-risk AML, excluding APL, and demonstrated significant differences between them. Patients with NPM1mut AML were significantly older than those in the other groups. Targeted next-generation sequencing on DNA from peripheral blood or bone marrow revealed significantly more mutations in NPM1mut AML than the other favorable-risk diseases, especially in genes related to DNA splicing and methylation. CEBPAmut/mut AMLs exhibited more mutations in transcription-related genes. Patients with NPM1mut AML and CEBPAmut/mut AML show significantly reduced overall survival in comparison with CBF-KITwt AML. These findings emphasize that favorable-risk AML patients have divergent outcomes and that differences in clinical and genotypic characteristics should be considered in their evaluation and management.",

     "abstract": "Immune dysregulation is a common feature of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), particularly in early stages. However, the genetic basis remains poorly understood. We recently reported that macrophages from mice deficient in tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 (Tet2), a model of MDS/CMML, are hyperinflammatory and have increased expression of arginase 1 (Arg1). In macrophages and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) expression of Arg1 contributes to T-cell suppression and immune evasion by L-arginine depletion, in the setting of chronic inflammation and cancer. Since human MDS and CMML are driven by TET2 mutations and associated with chronic inflammation, we hypothesized that arginase enzymatic activity and ARG1 expression would be increased in human MDS/CMML bone marrow. Elevated arginase activity was observed in bone marrow mononuclear cells of MDS and CMML patients with lower-grade features. Immunohistochemical studies confirmed that myelomonocytic cells overexpress ARG1. Additionally, mutations in the epigenetic regulators TET2 and DNMT3A corresponded to high ARG1 expression and activity. These findings suggest ARG1 is a biomarker of immune dysregulation in early MDS and CMML. Recent murine findings have implicated Tet2 and Dnmt3a in regulation of innate immunity. Our study suggests similar changes may be driven by human TET2 and DNMT3A mutations.",

     "abstract": "Bone marrow (BM) failure is often seen in leukemia patients, indicating an abnormal hematopoietic process. However, hematopoiesis in leukemic milieus is largely unknown. In the present study, we utilized one of the most frequent leukemogenic translocations MLL-AF9 to induce leukemia and investigated the hematopoiesis and the activity of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in a leukemic milieu. We found that the phenotypes of the non-leukemic population in leukemic BM were drastically different than normal BM, including blockage of differentiation and a drastically reduced Lin-/Sca+/c-kit+ (LSK) population that contains all HSPCs in leukemic BM. Further, transplantation assays demonstrated that stem cell function of HSPCs from leukemic BM was significantly compromised. Intriguingly, BM from a patient-derived xenograft leukemia model and from immunocompromised mice transplanted with murine MLL-AF9 cells, showed comparable percentage of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to normal controls, indicating that an immunocompetent microenvironment is critical for leukemia-induced loss of HSPCs. Mechanistically, we found that the non-leukemic cells from leukemic BM possessed a more inflammatory profile than either leukemic cells or normal BM counterparts. Co-culturing or co-transplantation with non-leukemic cells from leukemic BM impaired the stem cell function of normal HSPCs in vitro and in vivo respectively, suggesting that the highly inflammatory non-leukemic population in leukemic BM not only is functionally abnormal but displayed a \u2018leukemia-like\u2019 characteristic. Finally, we tested the effect of the anti-inflammation drug diclofenac on leukemia mice. However, no phenotypic changes of HSPCs were observed upon diclofenac treatment due to only mild repression of inflammatory genes by diclofenac, further indicating that inflammation is a powerful negative regulator of HSPCs. Together, our results suggest that leukemia impairs normal hematopoiesis and inflammation as well as immune cells play a critical role in leukemia-induced BM failure.",

     "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal disease characterized by insufficiency of bone marrow, increase of apoptosis and increased risk of acute leukemia progression. Proteins related to the mitotic spindle (AURKA, AURKB, TPX2), to the mitotic checkpoint (MAD2, CDC20) and the regulation of the cell cycle (p21) are directly related to chromosomal stability and tumor development. This study aimed to evaluate the mRNA expression levels of these genes in 101 MDS patients using a real-time PCR methodology. We identified that CDC20 expression are increased in patients with dysmegakaryopoiesis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024), thrombocytopenia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) and high-risk patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014, 0.018) MAD2 expression are decreased in patients with 2 or 3 cytopenias (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000) and neutrophil below 800/mm3. TPX2 is also overexpressed in patients presenting dysmegakaryopoiesis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). A decrease in AURKA and AURKB expression were observed in patients with altered karyotype (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000), who presented dysplasia in 3 lineages (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000; 0.017) and hemoglobin inferior to 8\u00a0g/dL (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024). The expression of AURKA, AURKB and MAD2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.000; 0.001; 0.025) were decreased in patients with hypoplastic MDS, associated with high frequency of chromosomal alterations and high mortality rate. This study reaffirms the importance of aurora kinases and mitotic spindle genes to the pathogenesis and clinical evolution of MDS.",

Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to detect FOXQ1 expression in 117 NKTCL patients and 120 healthy controls. Additionally, FOXQ1 expression in NKTCL cell lines (HANK-1, NK-92, SNK-6, SNT-8 and YT) was determined by western blotting and qRT-PCR. SNK-6 cells were transfected with FOXQ1-shRNA or Shh pathway inhibitor Cyclopamine/recombinant protein Shh. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and 5-bromo-2-deoxy-uridine (BrdU) incorporation assays were conducted to detect cell proliferation, flow cytometry was used to determine the cell cycle and cell apoptosis, and western blotting was used to detect protein expression. FOXQ1 expression was higher in NKTCL patients than in healthy controls, which was related to Ann Arbor stage, bone marrow involvement and the 5\u00a0year survival rate in NKTCL patients. Moreover, FOXQ1 expression, pathological type, Ann Arbor stage, B symptom and bone marrow involvement were independent risk factors in NKTCL. Shh pathway-related proteins were down-regulated after transfection of SNK-6 cells with FOXQ1-shRNA. Additionally, SNK-6 cell proliferation was greatly reduced, the cell cycle was blocked at the G0/G1 phase, and the expression of CyclinD1 and CyclinE was markedly decreased, while an increase in cell apoptosis with elevated Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and Caspase-3 and reduced B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2) were also observed. However, no significant alterations were observed between the FOXQ1-shRNA\u00a0+\u00a0Shh and Blank groups. The inhibition of FOXQ1 restricted NKTCL cell proliferation and growth but induced apoptosis via blocking the Shh signaling pathway.",

Bcr-Abl protein depletion is considered as a way to overcome drug resistance to TKIs. In our study, Chk1 inhibitors, AZD7762 and MK-8776, had strong antitumor effects on CML cell line KBM5 and imatinib-resistant form KBM5T315I. Moreover, Chk1 inhibitors showed a strong cytotoxic effect on leukemia cells from primary CML and imatinib-resistance CML patients, but low cytotoxic effect on normal human mononuclear cells. Then, we found that Chk1 inhibitors induced apoptosis and increased DNA damage in CML cell lines with the degradation of the Bcr-Abl protein. Using the proteasome inhibitor and an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that Chk1 inhibitors triggered the degradation of Bcr-Abl through ubiquitination, which is depending on E3 ubiquitin ligase CHIP. At last, MK-8776 showed a significant tumor-suppressive effect of KBM5T315I cell in xenograft tumor models. Taking together, these findings suggest that targeting Chk1 may overcome TKIs resistance for the treatment of CML.",

Our lab and others have demonstrated that a small-molecule inhibitor of WEE1, AZD1775, sensitizes acute leukemia cells to cytarabine; however, a mechanism of combinatorial activity has remained elusive. Thus, we sought to determine the relative contribution of WEE1 targets CDK1 and CDK2 to the combinatorial activity of AZD1775 and cytarabine. To accomplish this, we expressed \u201cWEE1 resistant\u201d CDK1 (CDK1-AF) and CDK2 (CDK2-AF) constructs in a T-ALL cell line. Expression of CDK1/2-AF together, but neither alone, enhanced the anti-proliferative effects, DNA damage and apoptosis induced by cytarabine. Furthermore, pharmacologic inhibition of CDK1 alone or CDK1 and CDK2 together reduced the combinatorial activity of AZD1775 and cytarabine. Thus, increased activity of both CDK1 and CDK2 in response to WEE1 inhibition is necessary for the combinatorial activity of AZD1775 and cytarabine. This suggests the role of WEE1 in cells with accumulated DNA damage extends beyond regulation of CDK1 and the G2/M checkpoint and highlights the importance of WEE1 in mediating progression through the cell cycle.",

For this pilot study, we evaluated a cohort of 12 patients with refractory AML using an ex vivo drug sensitivity testing (DST) platform. Purified AML blasts were screened with a panel of 215 FDA-approved compounds and treatment response was evaluated after 72\u00a0h of exposure. Drug sensitivity scoring was reported to the treating physician, and patients were then treated with either DST- or non-DST guided therapy. We observed survival benefit of DST-guided therapy as compared to the survival of patients treated according to physician recommendation. Three out of four DST-treated patients displayed treatment response, while all of the non-DST-guided patients progressed during treatment.

In this study, we used ATR or PTEN siRNA and observed that the specific cell arrest and apoptosis of BALL-1 cells in DDR caused by 3EZ, 20Ac-ingenol was dependant on activation of ATR and downregulation of nuclear p-Akt through upregulation of PTEN. Moreover, some B cell lymphomas among ALLs overexpress cyclin D1. The DDR induced during the S-phase with 3EZ, 20Ac-ingenol treatment was increased by the intra S-phase checkpoint response that was triggered by the loss of nuclear cyclin D1 regulation in BALL-1 cells overexpressing cyclin D1. Although topo 1 catalytic inhibitors induce a decatenation checkpoint and subsequent G2/M phase arrest, the decatenation checkpoint caused by 3EZ, 20Ac-ingenol induced apoptosis only in the BALL-1 cells that accumulated cyclin D1.",

MRD was assessed by the quantitative expression of the pan-leukemic marker Wilms' tumor (WT1) gene, according to the validated LeukemiaNet method.Between 2005 and 2016, 122 consecutive AML patients, WT1 positive at diagnosis, received allo-SCT in cytologic complete remission (cCR). The median age at SCT was 53 years (range 18\u201370). Quantitative analysis of WT1 gene expression (bone marrow samples) was available in all cases both at diagnosis (100% of samples overexpressed WT1 with a mean of 8607\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08187 copies/104 Abelson) and immediately before allo-SCT. Eighty one cases (66%) were MRD-WT1 negative (WT1 <250 copies) and 41/122 (44%) cases were MRD-WT1 positive (WT1 >250 copies) prior to allo-SCT. We evaluated post-SCT overall survival (OS), disease free survival (DFS) and relapse rate (RR), according to MRD-WT1 status pre-SCT. Both post-allo-SCT OS and DFS were significantly improved in patients who were MRD-WT1 negative at the time of SCT compared with those who were MRD-WT1 positive, with a median OS and DFS not reached in the MRD-WT1 negative group and 9 and 8 months, respectively, in the WT1 positive group (OS log-rank p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; hazard ratio [HR] 3.9, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.0\u20137.38; DFS log-rank p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; HR 3.73, 95% CI 2.0\u20136.72). The RR after SCT was 15% (12/81) in pre-SCT MRD-WT1 negative cases and 44% (18/41) in MRD-WT1 positive cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.00073).Univariate analysis showed that MRD-WT1 negativity pre-SCT and grade <2 acute GVHD were significant prognostic factors for improved OS and DFS. However multivariate analysis showed MRD-WT1 negativity pre-SCT was the only independent prognostic factor for improved OS and DFS.These data show that pre allo-SCT molecular MRD evaluation using WT1 expression is a powerful predictor of post allo-SCT outcomes in AML undergoing SCT in cCR. Patients with both cCR and MRD-WT1 negativity before SCT have a very good outcome with lower RR and improved OS. The pre allo-SCT MRD-WT1 stratification in AML is a valuable tool to identify patients at high risk of post-SCT relapse, and can influence conditioning regimen intensification and/or post-SCT preemptive strategies.",

We evaluated 3581 male patients from the Spanish MDS Registry with a diagnosis of MDS or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). \u2212Y was identified in 177 patients (4.9%). Compared with the 2246 male patients with normal karyotype, \u2212Y group showed a reduced risk of leukemic transformation that did not translate into a survival advantage. The overall survival and the risk of leukemic transformation were not influenced by the percentage of metaphases with \u2212Y. The \u2212Y group was not enriched in patients with minor morphologic traits of dysplasia, suggesting that the better outcome in the \u2212Y group cannot be explained by enrichment in cases misdiagnosed as MDS. In conclusion, our results support the current recommendation of classifying patients with \u2212Y within the very good risk category of the IPSS-R for MDS and rule out a selection bias as a possible explanation of this better outcome. An analysis of the molecular basis of MDS with isolated \u2212Y would be of interest as it may provide a biological basis of protection against progression to acute leukemia.",

In this study, we retrospectively reviewed the treatment of 21 consecutive patients with coagulopathy, complicated by acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) with or without combination with rTM. Surprisingly, none of the 14 rTM-treated patients developed retinoic acid (RA)-related differentiation syndrome (DS). The co-culture of vascular endothelial cell-derived EA.hy926 and APL-derived NB4 cells in the presence of RA increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) in culture media, in parallel with activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and increased levels of intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1) in EA.hy926 cells. This was also associated with increased levels of the phosphorylated forms of VE-cadherin and enhanced vascular permeability of EA.hy926 monolayers. Importantly, addition of rTM to this co-culture system inhibited the RA-induced phosphorylation of p38 and VE-cadherin and decreased ICAM1 and vascular permeability in EA.hy926 cells, without a decrease inthe levels of TNF-\u03b1. Taken together, use of rTM may be a promising treatment strategy to prevent DS in APL patients who receive ATRA.",

Meanwhile, highly DAS-resistant cells, named K562-R cells, were obtained from K562-W cells with increasing concentrations of DAS. Stable under-expressing EphB4 cells (K562-R-EphB4-sh) were obtained from K562-R cells by RNA interference. K562-W, K562-R and K562-R-EphB4-sh cells (108) were respectively injected subcutaneously on the dorsal surface of BALB/C female nude mice to establish the xenografts models.The mRNA/protein of EphB4 was overexpressed in the DAS-resistant A2\u2013E2 in comparison with the A1\u2013E1 human cell lines. Further, compared with K562-R cells, the expressions of EphB4 and p-Rac1/Cdc42 protein/mRNA were significantly downregulated in K562-R-EphB4-sh cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). K562\u2013R cells showed the highest DAS resistance (IC50 10.54\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.67\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), but K562-R-EphB4-sh cells became sensitive to DAS (IC50 1.02\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The expression of EphB4/p-RhoA/MCL-1 protein was gradually increased in the stimulating of EphrinB2-Fc, which partly made K562-R-EphB4-sh cells restore sensitivity to DAS (4.18\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.30\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Meanwhile, the K562-R-EphB4-sh xenografts group had relatively good efficacy compared to K562-R xenografts nude mice receiving the same dose of DAS. The analysis of xenografts tissue also suggested parallel results with the overexpression of EphB4/RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN/MCL-1 in K562-R xenografts, which decreased in the A2-R-EphB4-sh xenografts (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).The present study found that a new DAS resistance pathway of EphB4 overexpression was triggered by EphrinB2-Fc, which induced the resistance to DAS by activating RhoA/ROCK1/PTEN/MCL-1 signaling.",

Furthermore, we explored the in vivo activity of quinacrine in combination with the widely used AML agent cytarabine.The in vivo use of quinacrine (100\u00a0mg/kg three times per week for two consecutive weeks) significantly suppressed circulating blast cells at days 30/31 and increased the median survival time (MST). The in vitro drug combination analysis yielded promising synergistic interactions when combining quinacrine with cytarabine, azacitidine and geldanamycin. Finally, combining quinacrine with cytarabine in vivo showed a significant decrease in circulating leukemic blast cells and increased MST compared to the effect of either drug used alone, thus supporting the findings from the in vitro combination experiments.Taken together, the repositioning potential of quinacrine for treatment of AML is reinforced by demonstrating significant in vivo activity and promising synergies when quinacrine is combined with different agents, including cytarabine, the hypomethylating agent azacitidine and HSP-90 inhibitor geldanamycin.",

The present study evaluated the expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) and DICER1 gene in BM-derived MSC of patients with AML (n\u00a0=\u00a012), MDS (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and healthy controls (HC) (n\u00a0=\u00a08).miRNA expression profiles were analyzed by microarray and confirmations were performed using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Patient MSC displayed impaired proliferative and differentiation potential compared to HC. DICER1 gene expression was lower in MSC from MDS and AML patients than HC and some differentially expressed miRNAs indicated the potential involvement of DICER1 in the pathogenesis of MDS and AML. qRT-PCR confirmation revealed down-regulated miRNAs (hsa-miR-30d-5p, hsa-miR-222-3p and hsa-miR-30a-3p in MDS; hsa-miR-1275, hsa-miR-4725-5p and hsa-miR-143-3p in AML) and over-expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-4462 in MDS; hsa-miR-134-5p and hsa-miR-874-3p in AML) in MDS and AML.

In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), loss of function of EZH2 is known to contribute to pathogenesis, however the pattern of EZH2 mRNA and protein expression in MDS has not been extensively characterized.A total of 26 patients diagnosed with MDS were analyzed in this study. The relationship between EZH2 expression in patient bone marrow samples, evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblotting, and patient characteristics were analyzed. The function of truncated EZH2 proteins was examined in vitro.EZH2 expression levels and transcript sizes varied considerably between patients, but there was no relationship with the percentage blast component of patient samples. Cloning and sequencing of amplified RT-PCR fragments demonstrated that patients expressed multiple EZH2 transcripts containing insertions or deletions, with or without frameshift, mainly induced by altered splicing. All identified frameshift mutations were found to be 5\u2032 to the functional SET domain, and resulted in truncated protein translation. Altered patterns of EZH2 expression was observed in patients with or without alterations in genes involved with RNA splicing, SRSF2, U2AF1 and SF3B1. Functional analysis in vitro revealed that C-terminally truncated EZH2, lacking the SET domain, may impair the methyltransferase function of wild-type EZH2 in a dominant negative fashion.Our findings suggest that the loss of function of EZH2 induced by aberrant splicing, and/or EZH2 mutations resulting in the production of C-terminally truncated proteins, may be involved in MDS pathogenesis.",

Standard blood bank practice is to transfuse platelets, plasma and cryoprecipitate largely without regard to ABO blood group (platelets, cryoprecipitate), and, in some centers, transfusing ABO non-identical universal donor group AB plasma. Evidence from observational studies suggests that use of ABO non-identical blood components may be associated with increased bleeding. We hypothesized that use of ABO identical blood components and saline washed transfusions (red cells and platelets) would be associated with reduced early mortality in APL by avoidance of transfusion induced hemostatic dysfunction.This is a single center cohort study of APL patients treated in an 800 bed university community and referral hospital. Novel approaches to transfusion support, based upon randomized trials, include implementation of ABO identical platelet transfusions for all patients with acute leukemia in 1990, use of only ABO identical cryoprecipitate in 2005, and washed transfusions of red cells and platelets for all patients with acute leukemia <50\u00a0years of age beginning in 2006. Plasma transfusion has always been ABO identical. Two comparison populations were recent literature reports and the New York State Cancer Registry. We characterized 30\u2009day mortality in APL patients seen in our institution since 2000 as a convenience sample comparable to literature reports, beginning approxcimately when ATRA therapy became uniform for induction therapy. Only patients receiving their induction therapy in our hospital were included.Of 41 patients there were 2 early (30\u2009day) deaths (5%; a 71\u201381% reduction from expected). Early mortality at 100\u2009days was 7% (n\u00a0=\u00a03). The 30\u2009day mortality in the younger cohort <50\u00a0years of age (n\u00a0=\u00a016) receiving washed transfusions was 0%. Restricting the analysis to patients treated since 2006 (ABO identical transfusions, mostly washed) (n\u00a0=\u00a027; mean age 43 years; median 41 years; range 12\u201379), the early mortality rate at 30\u00a0days was 3.7%. Long-term survival (5 years) of our APL patients was similar to New York State Cancer Registry and literature reports (80\u201383%).APL patients supported with transfusion regimens including ABO identical blood components, with or without washing, experienced early mortality at 30\u2009days that was strikingly improved (71% to 86% lower) compared with that reported in the recent literature (3.7% to 5% vs. 17% to 26%). If these observed low rates of early mortality are related to transfusion practices, avoidance of ABO immune complex formation, and subsequent interference with hemostasis, is a plausible contributing mechanism. These favorable results provide a rationale for randomized trials of relatively simple and inexpensive approaches to reducing early hemorrhagic mortality in APL: use of ABO identical transfusions and washing to remove supernatant plasma.",

The goal of the current study is to assess the effects of As2S2 on bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) of MDS.BMMNCs were obtained from 10 lower risk MDS patients, 5 higher risk MDS patients, and 3 healthy controls. Then, the cells were treated with As2S2 for 48\u00a0h, using vorinostat (also known as SAHA) as control. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected. mRNA and protein levels of histone deacetylase-1 (HDAC1), Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), and erythroid transcription factor (GATA-1) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis.After As2S2 treatment in concentrations ranging from 3.125 to 100\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, cell proliferation was inhibited in both lower risk and higher risk MDS. Fifty percent inhibitory concentrations were 24.4\u00a0\u03bcmol/L and 23.6\u00a0\u03bcmol/L, respectively, for lower and higher risk MDS. Apoptotic cells significantly increased in both types of MDS. mRNA and protein levels of HDAC1 and TLR2 were reduced, whereas GATA-1 was increased in both types of MDS.As2S2 could inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through histone acetylation modulation in MDS. Similar to SAHA, As2S2 could reduce TLR2 activation and increase GATA-1 expression. Current data suggest epigenetic and immunological alternations are involved in therapeutic mechanisms of realgar in the treatment of MDS.",

We found several non-synonymous genetic variants overlapping BM cells and MSCs, including TP53 and ASXL1, partially owing to the heterogenous cell fraction of MSC samples and lineage fidelity. We also found MSC-specific genetic variants with very low allelic frequency (7% to 8%), such as NF1-G2114D and NF1-G140. Further studies in large cohorts are needed to clarify the molecular properties of MSCs including age-related genetic alterations by targeted deep sequencing.",

Here we investigated drug resistance in AML at the level of cellular metabolism in order to identify early predictors of therapeutic response. Using extracellular flux analysis, we compared metabolic drug responses in AML cell lines sensitive or resistant to cytarabine or sorafenib after 24\u00a0h of drug treatment to a small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell line exposed to etoposide. Only drug-resistant AML cells maintained oxidative metabolism upon drug exposure while SCLC cells displayed an overall metabolic shift towards glycolysis, i.e. a Warburg effect to escape drug toxicity. Moreover, primary AML blasts displayed very low glycolytic activity, while oxygen consumption was readily detectable, indicating an essential role of oxidative pathways in the bioenergetics of AML blasts. In line with these observations, analysis of the mitochondrial membrane potential using tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester staining and flow cytometry allowed for clear discrimination between drug sensitive and resistant AML cell line clones and primary blasts after 24\u00a0h of treatment with cytarabine or sorafenib. Our data reveal a distinct metabolic phenotype of resistant AML cells and suggest that disrupting oxidative metabolism rather than glycolysis may enhance the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy in AML.",

The growth of xenografted tumors was significantly inhibited in the mice treated with NPM, which is comparable to the inhibitory effect of a classical anti-leukemia drug, cyclophosphamide. Combined treatment with NPM and cyclophosphamide further enhanced the growth inhibition of xenografted Jurkat-Luc cells. Immunohistochemistry staining with cleaved caspase 3 (cl-caspase 3) indicated a very heavy staining of cl-caspase 3 only in the tumor implants excised from the NPM-treated mice.

This chemotherapeutics resistance is established by clonal selection of resistant variants of the cancer cells. Recently, a horizontal transfer of chemo-resistance among cancer cells via extracellular vesicles (EVs) has been suggested.The aim of this research was to investigate the role of EVs in chemo-resistance in acute myeloid leukemia. For this purpose, the sensitive strain of the promyelocytic leukemia HL60 cell line was studied along with its multi-resistant strain, HL60/AR that overexpresses the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP-1). A chemo-resistance transfer between the two strains was established by treating HL60 cells with EVs generated by HL60/AR. This study reveals that EVs from HL60/AR can interact with HL60 cells and transfer at least partially, their chemo-resistance. EVs-treated cells begin to express MRP-1 probably due to a direct transfer of MRP-1 and nucleic acids transported by EVs. In this context, two microRNAs were highlighted for their high differential expression in EVs related to sensitive or chemo-resistant cells: miR-19b and miR-20a. Because circulating microRNAs are found in all biological fluids, these results bring out their potential clinical use as chemo-resistance biomarkers in acute myeloid leukemia.",

The 20 control group patients had non-haematological diseases and were hospitalized for the same period. We extracted 2\u00a0ml bone marrow, separated the mononuclear cells, obtained total proteins, and detected STAT3 protein levels with Western blot analyses.

Then, THP-1 cell viability was detected with CCK-8 assays, apoptosis was measured with flow cytometry, and the STAT3, caspase-3 and caspase-8 protein levels were assessed using Western blot analyses. THP-1 cells in logarithmic growth phase were subcutaneously injected into the necks of 5-week-old nude mice. The control group was subcutaneously injected with 0.1\u00a0ml PBS.

The mice in the intervention groups were intraperitoneally injected with ART, and the control group was injected with the same amount of normal saline. Then, changes in the tumours were observed. After the drug intervention, the total protein was extracted, and STAT3 expression was detected by Western blot analysis.Compared with the control group, the AML patients had significantly increased STAT3 protein levels (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). ART significantly inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. ART also increased THP-1cell apoptosis. After treatment with ART, STAT3 protein was significantly down-regulated, and apoptosis of the cells was induced by the activation of caspase-3 and caspse-8.AML patients had higher expression of STAT3 than that of the controls. ART induced apoptosis in THP-1 cells and inhibited the growth of xenografts in nude mice, and we also observed that ART down-regulated the expression of STAT3 and activated the caspase-3 and caspase-8.

ROS accumulation has detrimental effects also on hematopoietic stem cells and may contribute to MDS progression. The observation that iron chelation improves hematologic parameters and reduces transfusion dependence further indicates that iron overload impairs hematopoiesis. Over the past decade, the mechanisms regulating iron homeostasis and the complex interplay between iron overload and toxicity, ineffective hematopoiesis, and transformation to leukemia have become clearer.

     "abstract": "In the recent update of WHO classification, the definition of myeloid neoplasms with erythroid predominance has been modified shifting the main criteria for calculating blast percentage from non-erythroid cells (NEC) to all nucleated marrow cells (ANC). Thus, the cases previously classified as erythroid/myeloid subtype of acute erythroid leukemia (AEL) based on the 2008 WHO will now be categorized either as myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts (MDS-EB) or acute myeloid leukemia, not otherwise specified (AML-NOS). However, the clinical significance of this new classification has not been demonstrated. Thus, we reviewed a leukemia database and reclassified 38 cases previously diagnosed as AEL, erythroid/myeloid subtype, with the consideration of 2016 revision criteria. Twenty seven (71%) of them had >20% blasts in NEC but less than 20% blasts in ANC, and 11 (29%) had >20% in both NEC and ANC. There was no significant difference in overall survivals (OS) among AEL, MDS-EB, and AML-NOS (non-erythroid predominance, NEP). However, AML with myelodysplasia-related changes showed significant shorter OS than AEL, MDS-EB and AML-NOS (NEP). Our results indicate that in myeloid neoplasm with erythroid predominance, patients with >20% blasts, of either NEC or ANC, share similar clinical laboratory features and survival outcomes with AML-NOS.",

The study had a standard 3\u00a0+\u00a03 dose-escalation design to define the maximum-tolerated dose. Primary objectives were to determine safety, tolerability, and recommended oral daily dose of gandotinib for patients with JAK2V617F-positive myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia, or polycythemia vera. Secondary objectives included estimating pharmacokinetic parameters and documenting evidence of efficacy by measuring clinical improvement. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled and treated (31 myelofibrosis, 6 polycythemia vera, 1 essential thrombocythemia). The maximum-tolerated dose of gandotinib was 120\u00a0mg daily, based on dose-limiting toxicities of blood creatinine increase or hyperuricemia at higher doses. Maximum plasma concentration was reached 4\u00a0h after single and multiple doses, and mean half-life on day 1 was approximately 6\u00a0h. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events were diarrhea (55.3%) and nausea (42.1%), a majority of which were of grade 1 severity.

Thus, the clinical significance of isolated mutations in the most commonly mutated RNA splicing genes remains unknown. Here we report five unusual patients with an isolated mutation causing a loss of function of ZRSR2, a protein required for recognition of a functional 3\u2032 splice site. Two of the patients had a diagnosis of CCUS and three patients had an MDS disorder characterized by low risk features and absence of complex cytogenetic abnor-malities. Notably, all five cases were characterized predominantly by macrocytic anemia. In addition, one CCUS patient followed for more than 15 years with a transfusion dependent macrocytic anemia was found to have an inactivating ZRSR2 mutation with an allele frequency of >60%. We conclude that the common clinical features of patients with an isolated mutation of ZRSR2 are a macrocytic anemia without leukopenia, thrombocytopenia or an increase in marrow blast percentage. At least in some cases, the presence of an isolated ZRSR2 mutation can accompany a dominant hematopoietic clone with a low risk for transformation to frank dysplasia or acute leukemia.",

Building on a Phase I trial, we conducted a phase II trial comparing timed sequential AraC with or without MK-8776.Patients with relapsed or primary refractory AML were randomized 1:1 to receive either AraC with MK-8776 (Arm A); or AraC alone (Arm B).32 patients were treated: 14 assigned to Arm A and 18 to Arm B.

Dasatinib, a second-generation TKI, was developed to overcome TKI resistances. However, dasatinib resistances are also described but remain less characterized. To mimic in vivo acquired dasatinib resistance, the BCR-ABL1-positive cell line K562 was transiently treated with a pharmacological concentration of dasatinib, for a short time in the presence of stem cell factor. A dasatinib resistant counterpart (K562 RES) was developed. Investigation of resistance mechanisms using kinase substrate arrays revealed that FYN was overactivated in K562 RES. The FYN inhibitor KX2-391 cooperated with dasatinib to block K562 RES proliferation. Cell tracking experiments showed that activated FYN support cell proliferation independently of BCR-ABL1 in K562 RES cells. Moreover, the MEK-ERK pathway was found hyper-phosphorylated in K562 RES cells even in the presence of dasatinib. Actually, ERK1/2 activity supported viability in K562 RES only in the absence of BCR-ABL1 activity. Finally, BCR-ABL1 and MEK inhibitor combination was sufficient to induce cell death even in non-proliferating resistant cells. Considering the conditions used to generate this dasatinib resistant cell line, such a resistance mechanism could be found in dasatinib treated patients. Consequently, it is valuable to know that inhibition of the MEK-ERK1/2 axis can overcome this resistance.",

     "abstract": "Most persons age\u00a0\u226560 y with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) die from their disease. When interpreting clinical trials data from these persons one must be aware of substantial selection biases. Randomized trials of post-remission treatments can be performed upfront or after achieving defined landmarks. Both strategies have important limitations. Selection of the appropriate treatment is critical. Age, performance score, co-morbidities and frailty provide useful data to treatment selection. If an intensive remission induction therapy is appropriate, therapy with cytarabine and an anthracycline is the most common regimen. Non-intensive therapies consist of the hypo-methylating drugs azacitidine and decitabine, low-dose cytarabine and supportive care. Feasibility of doing an allotransplant in older persons with AML is increasing. However, only very few qualify.Results of cytogenetic testing are risk factor in young and old persons with AML. Adverse abnormalities are more frequent in older persons. Although data about the frequency of mutations in older persons with AML is increasing their prognostic impact is less clear than in younger subjects. Neither differences in the distribution of cytogenetic risk, mutations, nor differences in clinical risk factors between younger and older persons with AML completely explain the age-dependent outcome. Many drugs are in clinical development in older persons with AML. Their potential role in the treatment of older persons with AML remains to be defined.",

BIM is also involved in the responses to glucocorticoid and chemotherapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), suggesting a possible association between deletion polymorphism of BIM and the chemosensitivity of ALL. Thus, we analyzed 72 B-cell precursor (BCP)-ALL cell lines established from Japanese patients. Indeed, higher BIM gene expression was associated with good in vitro sensitivities to glucocorticoid and chemotherapeutic agents used in induction therapy. We also analyzed the methylation status of the BIM gene promoter by next generation sequencing of genome bisulfite PCR products, since genetic polymorphism could be insignificant when epigenetically inactivated. Hypermethylation of the BIM gene promoter was associated with lower BIM gene expression and poorer sensitivity to vincristine. Of note, however, the prevalence of a deletion polymorphism was not associated with the BIM gene expression level or drug sensitivities in BCP-ALL cell lines, in which the BIM gene was unmethylated. These observations suggest that an association of a deletion polymorphism of BIM and the response to induction therapy in BCP-ALL may be clinically minimal.",

Fifty patients (64.9%) had cardiac involvement and 17 patients (22.1%) showed IVST >15\u00a0mm. Among all patients, the revised Mayo Clinic Stage III\u2013IV and IVST >15\u00a0mm were independently associated with inferior overall survival (OS) in a multivariable analysis.

Furthermore, advanced-stage patients with IVST >15\u00a0mm did not show survival benefit from treatment with bortezomib-based regimens and/or autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT). Our study demonstrated that IVST >15\u00a0mm is adversely prognostic independent of the revised Mayo Clinic staging system in patients with AL amyloidosis.

While, the mechanisms underlying low dose cytarabine (LD Ara-c) is poorly understood.In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of LD Ara-C in vitro. U937 and HEL cell lines were treated with increasing dose of Ara-C and showed growth inhibition rates in a time and dose-dependent manner. Treatment with LD Ara-C (50\u00a0nM) induced a time-dependent increase in expression of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and beclin1, but degradation of sequestosome1 (p62) in both U937 and HEL cells. Characteristic of autophagosomes appeared after 24\u00a0h treatment. Meanwhile, deregulation of Akt-mTOR pathway was also detected. When cultured in presence of autophagy inhibitors, autophagy and differentiation was reversed, and cell growth inhibition was also attenuated. Similar phenomenon could also be seen when beclin1 expression was down-regulated.Taken together, we concluded that LD Ara-C can induce autophagy in AML cells and appeared to play an important role in differentiation and death. Down-regulation of Akt-mTOR pathway is involved in these processes. We suggest that cytarabine-induced autophagy is not a pro-survival mechanism, but accounts for its antineoplastic effects.",

We treated the human Burkitt- Lymphoma-derived cells lines Ramos and Raji with DZNep and examined HACE1 mRNA expression by RT-PCR. We also studied the effect of DZNep on the methylation of lysine 9 and 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3 and H3K9me2) associated with the CpG88 and CpG177 islands of the HACE1 promoters by chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR. CpG88 (hypomethylated) of the HACE1 promoter was enriched for histone marks H3K27me3 and H3K9me2 whereas CpG177 (hypermethylated) was only enriched for H3K9me2. DZNep treatment increased HACE1 gene expression which was further increased by the addition of trichostatine A (TSA), a promising therapeutic compound for the treatment of human B-Lymphoma. Histone methylation (both H3K9me2 and H3K27me3) of the HACE1 promoter concomitantly decreased. Our experiments suggest that HACE1 can be downregulated by methylation of its promoter region chromatin (H3K27me3 and H3K9me2), making HACE1 a potential target for DZNep combined with TSA. These results highlight the heterogeneity of HACE1 regulation in B-lymphoma and suggest that successful drug-induced restoration of epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor genes will require accurate characterization of cell type- and locus-specific gene silencing mechanisms.",

These data are further supported by our observations that CLL derived Tregs appear rather incapable of inducing apoptosis of both normal B cells and CLL cells, in contrast to normal Tregs, suggesting an immunoediting effect of CLL cells on Tregs which negatively affects the functionality of the latter and contributes to the failure of Tregs in CLL to efficiently eliminate the abnormal clone.",

Recent studies reported that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells derived from MM patients (MM-MSCs) revealed various characteristics compared with these from healthy subjects (NM-MSCs). However, the functions and mechanisms by which MM-MSCs mediate the chemotherapy resistance of MM remain unclear. In this study, we show that MM-MSCs decreased melphalan or doxorubicin-induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in two MM cell lines (U266 and RPMI-8226). Mechanistically, we demonstrate that MM-MSCs promote the expressions of autophagy related genes to activate autophagy, followed by ultimately NF-\u03baB signaling activation in MM cells. Inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling reversed the protective effects of MM-MSC on MM cells. Moreover, autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) or 3-Methyladenine (3MA) treatment significantly suppressed phosphorylation and consequently degradation of NF-\u03baB inhibitor I-\u03baB\u03b1, reduced MM-MSCs-mediate activation of NF-\u03baB and prevented MM-MSCs-induced resistance. Taken together, our findings indicate MM-MSCs are involved in the mechanism of the chemotherapy resistance of MM. Therefore, the inhibition of MM-MSCs-induced autophagy may combat chemotherapy resistance and provide a promising therapeutic strategy for MM treatment.",

The aim of the present study was to identify genes differentially expressed in MSCs isolated from CML patients at diagnosis (CML-MSCs) as compared to MSCs from healthy controls. Using a custom gene-profiling assay, we identified six genes over-expressed in CML-MSCs (BMP1, FOXO3, MET, MITF, NANOG, PDPN), with the two highest levels being documented for PDPN (PODOPLANIN) and NANOG. To determine whether this aberrant signature persisted in patients in deep molecular response induced by TKIs, we analyzed MSCs derived from such patients (MR-MSCs). This analysis showed that, despite the deep molecular responses, BMP1, MET, MITF, NANOG, and PDPN mRNA were upregulated in MR-MSCs. Moreover, BMP1, MITF, and NANOG mRNA expressions in MR-MSCs were found to be intermediate between control MSCs and CML-MSCs. These results suggest that CML-MSCs exhibit an abnormal gene expression pattern which might have been established during the leukemogenic process and persist in patients in deep molecular response.",

     "abstract": "The aberrant activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is involved in the development of multiple myeloma; thus, this signaling pathway is a potential target for the development of therapeutics for this malignancy. Here, we performed cell-based chemical screening and found that CGK012, a pyranocoumarin compound, suppressed the Wnt3a-CM-mediated activation of \u03b2-catenin response transcription. CGK012 induced \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41, leading to proteasomal degradation and reducing the level of intracellular \u03b2-catenin. Furthermore, CGK012 consistently decreased the amount of \u03b2-catenin and repressed the expression of cyclin D1, c-myc, and axin-2 (downstream target genes of \u03b2-catenin) in RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma cells. In addition, CGK012 inhibited the proliferation of RPMI-8226 cells and promoted apoptosis, as indicated by the increase in the population of Annexin V-FITC-stained cells and caspase-3/7 activity. These findings suggest that CGK012 could exert antiproliferative activity against multiple myeloma cells by attenuating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway; thus, it may have potential as a therapeutic agent for multiple myeloma treatment.",

Excluding well-known socioeconomic issues, genetic markers important for prognosis have not been properly incorporated into the clinical practice so far and their usefulness outside of well-controlled clinical trials remain unknown.Here, we assessed the clinical significance of the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) recommendations in 196 consecutive patients with AML in a real-life setting. All patients were younger than 60 years of age (49% male) and treated with conventional chemotherapy for induction and consolidation in three Brazilian Institutions that well represent Brazilian geographic and socioeconomic diversity.Multivariable analysis showed that ELN recommendations had a slight association with complete remission achievement (odds ratio: 0.74, 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.53-1.01; P\u00a0=\u00a00.06), but were independently associated with poor overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio, HR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.1-1.54; P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR: 1.42, 95% CI: 1.03-1.95; P\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and event-free survival (EFS) (HR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.06-1.47; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007), considering initial leukocyte counts and age as confounders.

It has been reported p53 deletion is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and organ infiltrations of MM. However, p53 deletion in the migration and dissemination of MM cells has not been totally elucidated. In this research, first, we investigated whether p53 is associated with migration of MM cells. We found that p53 regulates the migration of NCI-H929 cells with wild-type p53 but not U266 cells with mutated-type p53. Next, we investigated the related mechanism by which p53 regulates the migration. We found that down-regulation of p53 reduced adhesion of NCI-H929 cells to the BM stroma via decreased expression of E-cadherin and increased EMT-regulating proteins. Further study have identified the miR-19a/CXCR5 pathway as a candidate p53-induced migration mechanism. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time the critical value of p53 deletion in MM cell migration and dissemination, as well as the acquisition of an EMT-like phenotype. Our research provides new insights into the function of p53 in migration of MM and suggests p53/miRNA19a/CXCR5 may provide potentially therapeutic targets for the treatment of myeloma with p53 deletion.",

Disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for MDS can reduce transfusion requirements, although the optimum timing of DMT initiation is unclear. This retrospective study analyzed linked SEER registry and Medicare claims (2006\u20132012) to estimate the impact of DMT-initiation (azacitidine, decitabine, or lenalidomide) timing (\u2264 3 vs.\u00a0>\u00a03\u00a0months from start of TD) on the likelihood of achieving transfusion independence (TI) among 508 TD patients with MDS.

Fewer early initiators used erythropoiesis-stimulating agents before achieving TI versus late initiators (61.5% vs. 73.9%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). In multivariate analyses, early DMT initiation predicted TI achievement (HR, 1.69; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001); patients who met minimum active therapy-exposure requirements were more likely to achieve TI (HR, 2.12; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Relevant VAE comprise peripheral, cerebral, and coronary artery changes in patients receiving nilotinib, venous and arterial occlusive events during ponatinib therapy, and pulmonary hypertension in patients receiving dasatinib. Although each TKI binds to a unique profile of molecular targets in leukemic cells and vascular cells, the exact etiology of drug-induced vasculopathies remains uncertain. Recent data suggest that predisposing molecular factors, pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors as well as certain comorbidities contribute to the etiology of VAE in these patients. In addition, direct effects of these TKI on vascular endothelial cells have been demonstrated and are considered to contribute essentially to VAE evolution. In the current article, we discuss mechanisms underlying the occurrence of VAE in TKI-treated patients with CML, with special emphasis on vascular and perivascular target cells and involved molecular (vascular) targets of VAE-triggering TKI. In addition, we discuss optimal patient selection and drug selection through which the risk of occurrence of cardiovascular events can hopefully be minimized while maintaining optimal anti-leukemic effects in CML, thereby following the principles of personalized medicine.",

     "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is a progressive plasma cell malignancy, with a range of clinical features including bone lesions, renal insufficiency, anaemia, and hypercalcaemia. Novel agents have significantly improved patient survival, however most patients will suffer multiple relapses. Although clinical challenges and economic costs of relapse are recognised, the psychological impact of relapse is not fully appreciated. Additionally, there is little information on how physicians perceive the impact of relapse on their patients\u2019 emotional state and how this might affect patient management.Through face-to-face interviews with 50 relapsed and/or refractory MM patients and 30 haematologists across ten countries, we have used real-world evidence to explore and characterise the burden of living with MM, particularly the impact of relapsed disease.This exploratory study illustrates the impact of the disease on friends and family, and the physical and emotional burden experienced by the patient resulting from both MM and its treatment. Haematologists feel poorly equipped to deal with the emotional aspects of patient relapse, lacking the time and resources to adequately deal with these issues.Focused educational and support tools/resources targeted at both physicians and patients are required to facilitate physician\u2013patient communication to help reduce the emotional burden of living with MM.",

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is frequently treated with induction and consolidation chemotherapy. Consolidation chemotherapy can be delivered on an ambulatory basis, requiring some patients to travel long distances for treatment at specialized centers. We developed a shared care model where patients receive consolidation chemotherapy at a quaternary center, but post-consolidation supportive care at local hospitals. To evaluate the impact of our model on patient travel and outcomes we conducted a retrospective analysis of AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia patients receiving consolidation over four years at our quaternary center. 73 patients received post-consolidation care locally, and 344 at the quaternary center. Gender, age and cytogenetic risk did not significantly differ between groups. Shared care patients saved mean round trip distance of 146.5\u00a0km\u00a0\u00b1\u00a099.6 and time of 96.7\u00a0min\u00a0\u00b1\u00a063.4 compared to travelling to quaternary center. There was no significant difference in overall survival between groups, and no increased hazard of death for shared care patients. 30, 60, and 90\u00a0day survival from start of consolidation was 98.6%, 97.2%, and 95.9% for shared care and 98.8%, 97.1%, and 95.3% for quaternary center patients. Thus, a model utilizing regional partnerships for AML post-consolidation care reduces travel burden while maintaining safety.",

For many years, conventional karyotyping has been used as the standard diagnostic tool for t (9;22) (q34;q11.2). However, it has several limitations that may lead to failure for detecting BCR-ABL1 gene rearrangements in around 5% of all CML patients. Although reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has evolved as a sensitive method for detecting BCR-ABL1 translocation, this method fail to detect certain BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript type, such as e13a3 (also known as b2a3), as a result of many commercially available and laboratory-developed primer sets. Fortunately, these two rare situations rarely appear at the same time, therefore, the combination of two methods rarely misdiagnosed the patients with CML. In this study, we report a patient with CML who tested both negative by RT-PCR and cytogenetic analysis at the time of diagnosis. She was diagnosed as atypical CML (aCML) and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was suggested. Further fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed cryptic insertion of ABL into BCR gene on chromosome 22, and DNA sequencing with alternative primer sets demonstrated the presence of an e13a3 BCR-ABL1 fusion. She was diagnosed as CML and received imatinib 400\u2009mg/day.

Although IM-resistance can be due to BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutations, many IM-resistant patients do not have detectable BCR-ABL KD mutations. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs that control gene expression. To investigate the role of miRNAs in IM-resistance, we recruited 8 chronic phase CML patients with IM-resistance who tested negative for BCR-ABL KD mutations and 2 healthy normal controls. Using miRNA sequencing, we identified 54 differentially expressed miRNAs; 43 of them downregulated. The 3 most differentially downregulated miRNAs were miR-146a-5p, miR-99b-5p and miR-151a-5p. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the expression patterns of the 3 miRNAs were validated on the same cohort of 8 patients in addition to 3 other IM-resistant CML patients. In-silico analysis showed that the predicted gene targets are ATRIP, ATR, WDR48, RAD51C and FANCA genes which are involved in the Fanconi Anemia/BRCA pathway. This pathway regulates DNA damage response (DDR) and influences disease response to chemotherapy. Thus it is conceivable that DDR constitutes a key component in IM-resistance. Further research is needed to elucidate miRNA modulation of the predicted gene targets.",

Herein, we demonstrate here the presence of a novel spliced isoform of TIN2S in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), related to deletion of exon 2 in the TIN2 gene. The expressions of spliced TIN2S mRNA varied widely in CLL and there was an inverse relationship between the mRNA levels of full-length TIN2S and the spliced moiety. Small amounts of spliced TIN2S were also observed in normal B cells but not in T cells. Spliced TIN2S appeared dysfunctional, as immunoprecipitation studies showed the typical association of TRF2 and TIN2 in normal lymphocytes but not in CLL cells. Moreover, whereas TRF2 localized to the nucleus in normal lymphocytes, it was present in both nuclei and cytoplasm in CLL cells. The levels of spliced TIN2S increased with age and in 3 of 8 patients increased over time. The presence of the spliced variant failed to be related to telomere length in CLL suggesting other functions for this protein.

Autophagy is usually considered a pro-survival mechanism, and cooperates with the ubiquitin proteasome system in maintaining the homeostasis of myeloma cells by degrading excessive and misfolded proteins for energy recycling. Therefore, the inhibition of autophagy could effectively induce death in myeloma cells, and could synergize with proteasome inhibitors. However, the excessive activation of autophagy could also lead to the extreme degradation of the organelles that induce autophagic cell death. Hence, the activation of autophagic cell death might also represent a promising approach for treating myeloma. Recent studies have demonstrated that autophagy also mediates drug resistance in myeloma cells and the complications of myeloma, while the inhibition of autophagy may reverse the response to drugs. In this study, we have mainly reviewed recent research on autophagy in relationship to the therapeutic effect, the reversal of drug resistance, and the mediation of complications.",

The role of thrombocytapheresis, or plateletpheresis, in hyperthrombocytosis has become increasingly obsolete given the proactive titration of cytoreductive therapies and early identification and correction of reversible causes of reactive thrombocytosis. Despite its narrowed indications, plateletpheresis continues to offer a valuable temporizing measure in platelet count reduction before cytoreductive agents exert their maximal effect. In this context, it is important for the treating physician to be aware of the symptoms and risks associated with hyperthrombocytosis to inform best clinical practices.

However, the great strides in the knowledge on molecular genetics need parallel progresses on the best approach to methods for detecting and reporting disease-associated mutations, and to shape the most effective and rationale testing pathway in the diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of MPNs. The MPN taskforce of the Italian Society of Hematology (SIE) assessed the scientific literature and composed a framework of the best, possibly evidence-based, recommendations for optimal molecular methods as well as insights about the applicability and interpretation of those tests in the clinical practice, and clinical decision for testing MPNs patients. The issues dealt with: source of samples and nucleic acid template, the most appropriate molecular abnormalities and related detection methods required for diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of MPNs, how to report a diagnostic molecular test, calibration and quality control. For each of these issues, practice recommendations were provided.",

     "abstract": "Extensive studies on SHP-1 protein and SHP-1 mRNA revealed that the diminishment or abolishment of the expression of SHP-1 in leukemias/lymphomas was due to aberrant promoter methylation. Thus far, the mechanism of epigenetic silencing of the SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase gene that occurs in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells remains poorly understood.The expressions of the target molecules were determined by quantitative real time PCR and western blot, respectively. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was used to detect methylation status of DNA CpG. The lentiviral vectors were applied to modify gene expression.In the present study, we found that the promoter 2 of SHP-1 gene is located between positions from \u2212577\u00a0bp to +300\u00a0bp, and 22 CpG sites contained in positions \u2212353\u00a0bp\u00a0\u223c\u00a0+182\u00a0bp are aberrantly methylated in K562 cells. In vitro, we demonstrated that DNMT1 silencing induced demethylation of the 22 CpG sites located in the SHP-1 promoter and re-expression of SHP-1 gene in K562 cells. Moreover, we proved that the expression levels of DNMT1 and SHP-1 mRNA and protein were negatively correlated in K562 cells and BM aspirates mononuclear cells from CML patients.Collectively, these results indicate that DNMT1 mediates aberrant methylation and silencing of SHP-1 gene in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, and provide a novel therapeutic target for CML.",

Interestingly, overexpression of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a), which was under-expressed in iron overload models, reduced ROS levels and attenuated cell damage caused by iron overload in MDS/AML cells. And gene knockdown of HIF-1a got the similar results as iron overload in MDS/AML cells. Furthermore, iron overload caused high erythroid apoptosis was closely related with ROS in MDS patients. Importantly, the HIF-1a protein levels of erythrocytes elevated obviously after incubation with desferrioxamine (DFO) from MDS patients with iron overload, accompanied by ROS levels inhibited and erythroid apoptosis reduced. Taken together, our findings determine that the HIF-1a/ROS signaling pathway plays a key role in promoting erythroid apoptosis in MDS patients with iron overload.",

To assess the functional role between these polymorphisms and MDS, we evaluated 189 samples stratified in two groups: 95 bone marrow samples from MDS patients and 94 from healthy elderly volunteers used as controls. Genotypes for all polymorphisms were identified in DNA samples in an allelic discrimination experiment by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We also studied the mRNA expression of XPA and XPC genes to evaluate if its polymorphisms were functional in 53 RNAm MDS patients by qPCR methodologies. To the rs2228000 polymorphism, the CT and TT polymorphic genotype were associated with increased odds ratio (OR) of more profound cytopenia (hemoglobin and neutrophils count). To the rs1799793 polymorphism, we found that the GG homozygous wild-type genotype was associated with a decreased chance of developing MDS. We observed low expression of XPA in younger patients, in hypoplastic MDS and patients with abnormal karyotype when presented AG or AA polymorphic genotypes. We also found that there was a statistically significant interaction between the presence of micromegakaryocyte on down regulation of XPC regarding the CT heterozygous genotype of the rs1800975 polymorphism.

However, many patients treated with TKIs suffer from TKI-related complications. In particular, vascular events such as peripheral artery occlusive disease have become aserious clinical problem for patients who receive the TKI, nilotinib. At present, the molecular mechanisms by which TKIs cause vascular endothelial cell insults remain unknown.This study explored the effects of the TKIs, imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib, on vascular endothelial cells in vitro, and found that only nilotinib induced expression of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) by vascular endothelial cells. Nilotinib-induced IL-1\u03b2 expression stimulated the adhesion of monocytes to vascular endothelial cells in association with an increase in levels of adhesion molecules. MicroRNA database searching identified miR-3121-3p binding sites in the 3\u2032-UTR of the IL-1\u03b2 gene. Exposure of endothelial cells to nilotinib caused downregulation of miR-3121-3p in these cells. Importantly, forced-expression of miR-3121-3p counteracted nilotinib-induced expression of IL-1\u03b2. Importantly, serum levels if IL-1\u03b2 were significantly elevated in CML patients receiving nilotinib (n\u00a0=\u00a014) compared to those receiving other TKIs (n\u00a0=\u00a016) (3.76\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.22\u00a0pg/ml vs 0.27\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.77\u00a0pg/ml, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Azacitidine and panobinostat increased median survival by 26 and 6\u00a0days respectively in MV4;11 xenografted mice. Mice treated with both drugs showed a drastic reduction in leukemic burden leading to complete remission sustained for the duration of the experimental period lasting more than 519\u00a0days. Reduced leukemic burden and prolonged survival was also observed in AML-193 xenografted mice treated with azacitidine-panobinostat combination. Differential gene expression profiling was performed on AML cells treated with azacitidine, panobinostat or azacitidine-panobinostat combination. Functional mapping of transcripts uniquely regulated by the azacitidine-panobinostat combination in MV4;11 cells identified p53 as an upstream regulator. A comparison of the uniquely modulated transcripts by azacitidine-panobinostat combination in MV4;11 cells versus AML-193 and THP-1 cells, bearing mutated p53, also revealed p53 as the topmost upstream regulator. Finally, expression of mutant p53 in MV4;11 cells reduced sensitivity to azacitidine-panobinostat combination, suggesting that p53 may be a predictor of response to epigenetic therapy in pediatric AML.",

We first detected the physical interaction and co-localization of CFTR and HDAC2 in Ph+ leukemia cell lines. And treatment with CFTRinh-172, a CFTR inhibitor, reduced the expression of HDAC2 protein in K562 and SUP-B15 cells, which could be partially recovered by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Additionally, high expression levels of HDAC2 protein were observed in CFTR cDNA transfected HEK-293 and Ba/F3 cells. Next, we found that HDAC2 bound in the promoter region of the PTEN gene, and treatment with HDAC2 inhibitor or CFTRinh-172 resulted in an increase in PTEN mRNA and protein levels and a decrease in PDK1 and mTOR (downstream signaling of PTEN) activity. Finally, the MTT assay revealed that CFTRinh-172 could strengthen the anti-proliferation effect of HDAC2 inhibitor on Ph+ leukemia cells.

We found that coculture of myeloma cells with a human stroma cell line significantly decreased the sensitivity of myeloma cells to BTZ treatment. HHT inhibited the proliferation of MM cells and potentiated the anti-myeloma effects of BTZ by inhibition of both canonical and noncanonical NF-\u03baB pathways.

We confirm, at the conclusion of this 5-year, prospective, non-interventional study, that overall survival was significantly longer in patients who received iron chelation therapy vs those who did not. Causes of death in the overall population were predominantly myelodysplastic syndromes/acute myeloid leukemia followed by cardiac disease. Time to progression to acute myeloid leukemia was also significantly longer in patients receiving chelation therapy, and significantly fewer patients progressed to leukemia vs those not receiving chelation therapy. Limitations of the study include a potential for clinical bias, as patients with longer predicted survival may have been chosen for chelation therapy, the differences present in concomitant conditions at baseline, and the possibility that some high-risk patients were not identified due to limited cytogenetic classification.",

     "abstract": "NPM1 insertion mutations represent a common recurrent genetic abnormality in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The frequency of these mutations varies from approximately 30% overall up to 50% in patients with a normal karyotype. Several recent studies have exploited advances in massively parallel sequencing technology to shed light on the complex genomic landscape of AML. We hypothesize that variant allele fraction (VAF) data derived from massively parallel sequencing studies may provide further insights into the clonal architecture and pathogenesis of NPM1-driven leukemogenesis. Diagnostic peripheral blood or bone marrow samples from NPM1-mutated AML patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0120) were subjected to targeted sequencing using a panel of fifty-seven genes known to be commonly mutated in myeloid malignancies. NPM1 mutations were always accompanied by additional mutations and NPM1 had the highest VAF in only one case. Nearly all NPM1-mutated AML patients showed concurrent mutations in genes involved in regulation of DNA methylation (DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, IDH2), RNA splicing (SRSF2, SF3B1), or in the cohesin complex (RAD21, SMC1A, SMC3, STAG2). Mutations in these genes had higher median VAFs that were higher (40% or greater) than the co-existing NPM1 mutations (median VAF 16.8%). Mutations associated with cell signaling pathways (FLT3, NRAS, and PTPN11) are also frequently encountered in NPM1-mutated AML cases, but had relatively low VAFs (7.0\u201311.9%). No cases of NPM1-mutated AML with a concurrent IDH2R172 mutation were observed, suggesting that these variants are mutually exclusive. Overall, these data suggest that NPM1 mutations are a secondary or late event in the pathogenesis of AML and are preceded by founder mutations in genes that may be associated with recently described preclinical states such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential or clonal cytopenias of undetermined significance.",

In the present study, changes in Tregs in peripheral blood (PB) were followed before and after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilization. In addition, functional analyses of Tregs in PB grafts and bone marrow (BM) grafts were performed. To probe the prognostic value of Tregs for aGVHD, an analysis of Tregs in haplo-identical grafts was conducted in 61 patients. Moreover, univariate and multivariate analyses of both clinical variables and cellular subsets were performed. The results showed that both the percentage Tregs of CD4+ T cells and absolute numbers of Tregs per 106 total nucleated cells significantly increased after G-CSF administration. Additionally, Tregs in PB grafts exhibited a stronger inhibitory effect on antigen-specific T cell proliferation than did Tregs in BM grafts. Strikingly, patients receiving more Tregs in PB grafts had a lower cumulative incidence of aGVHD II\u2013IV (36% versus 58%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.046). Further, in a multivariate analysis, the number of Tregs in PB grafts was significantly associated with a lower occurrence of aGVHD II\u2013IV (P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). In contrast, the number of Tregs in BM grafts was not associated with the occurrence of aGVHD in the current study. Further analysis showed that the Treg content in grafts did not affect Treg reconstitution, infection rate, or incidence of chronic GVHD after haplo-HSCT. Moreover, no significant correlations between cell types in grafts and the survival end points or relapse rates were found in the present study. In conclusion, our results suggest that a high number of Tregs in PB grafts is associated with reduced risk of aGVHD in haplo-HSCT in our transplant setting.",

Age, cytogenetics, and TET2E2S were independent prognostic factors for disease-free survival (DFS), and favorable effects on outcomes predominated in cytogenetic normal (CN)-AML and younger patients. Using the same cutoff in a validation cohort of 86 CN-AML patients, TET2E2Shigh patients were found to be younger than TET2low patients without a difference in the rate of complete remission. However, TET2E2Shigh patients exhibited a significantly lower CIR (p\u00a0<\u00a010\u22124). TET2E2S and FLT3-ITD, but not age or NPM1 mutation status were independent prognostic factors for DFS and event-free survival (EFS), while TET2E2S was the sole prognostic factor that we identified for overall survival (OS). In both the intermediate-1 and favorable ELN genetic categories, TET2E2S remained significantly associated with prolonged survival. There was no correlation between TET2E2S status and outcomes in 34 additional AML patients who were unfit for IC. Therefore our results suggest that assessments of TET2 exon 2 splicing status might improve risk stratification in CN-AML patients treated with IC.",

But there is little known the synergistic effect between CS055 and chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to explore the synergistic effect and molecular mechanisms of CS055 combination with Doxorubicin in PTCL cells. We found that CS055 showed dose- and time-dependent inhibition effects on PTCL cell. Meanwhile, the synergistic effect was significantly observed after combination treatment with lower drug-concentration of CS055 and Doxorubicin. Lower drug-concentration of CS055 induced weak apoptosis in PTCL cells, but combination treatment with CS055 and Doxorubicin promoted more significant apoptosis. Combination treatment with CS055 and Doxorubicin significantly changed mitochondrial membrane potential and H3 acetylated level, resulting in up-regulating DNA damage protein p-\u03b3H2AX and apoptosis proteins including cleaved-caspase-3, cleaved-caspase-9 and cleaved-PARP, and down-regulating anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. In a word, Doxorubicin could increase the CS055-induced inhibition effects on PTCL cells, suggesting that CS055 combination with Doxorubicin or Doxorubicin-based chemotherapy drugs might be a new therapy approach for PTCL patients.",

Recent studies have shown how interactions with the bone marrow microenvironment can protect ALL cells from chemotherapy and allow for the persistence of the disease. Epigenetic drugs have been used for the treatment of ALL, but there are no reports on whether these drugs can overcome bone marrow-induced chemoprotection. Our study investigates the ability of the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat to overcome chemoprotective effects mediated by osteoblasts. We show that the combination of azacitidine and panobinostat has a synergistic killing effect and that this combination is more effective than cytarabine in inducing ALL cell death in co-culture with osteoblasts. We also show that this combination can be used to sensitize ALL cells to chemotherapeutics in the presence of osteoblasts. Finally, we demonstrate that these effects can be replicated ex vivo in a number of mouse passaged xenograft lines from both B-ALL and T-ALL patients with varying cytogenetics. Thus, our data provides evidence that azacitidine and panobinostat can successfully overcome osteoblast-induced chemoprotection in vitro and ex vivo in both B-ALL and T-ALL cells.",

As B-cell developmental genes play a crucial role in this leukemia, we assessed such for recurrent deletions in diagnostic and relapse samples. We confirmed previous findings that the most prevalent deletions of these genes occur in CDKN2A, IKZF1, and PAX5, with several others at lower frequencies. Of the 16 samples having paired diagnostic and relapse samples, 5 showed new deletions in these recurrent B-cell related genes and 8 showed abolishment. Deletion of EBF1 heralded a significant negative prognostic impact on relapse free survival in univariate and multivariate analyses. The combination of both a CDKN2A/B deletion and an IKZF1 alteration (26% of cases) also showed a trend toward predicting worse overall survival compared to having only one or neither of these deletions. These findings add to the understanding of genomic influences on this comparably understudied disease cohort that upon further validation may help identify patients who would benefit from upfront treatment intensification.",

Furthermore, telomerase mutations are genetic risk factors for the occurrence of some hematologic cancers.

We hypothesized that dex utilizes translational pathways to promote apoptosis in MM and that specific targeting of these pathways could overcome dex-resistance. Global unbiased profiling of mRNA translational profiles in MM cells treated with or without dex revealed that dex significantly repressed eIF2 signaling, an important pathway for regulating ternary complex formation and protein synthesis. We demonstrate that dex induces the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 resulting in the translational upregulation of ATF4, a known eIF2 regulated mRNA. Pharmacologic induction of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation via activation of the heme-regulated eIF2\u03b1 kinase (HRI) induced apoptosis in MM cell lines and in primary MM cells from patients with dex-resistant disease. In addition, co-culture with marrow stroma failed to protect MM cells from apoptosis induced by targeting the eIF2 pathway. Combination therapy with rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, and BTdCPU, an activator of HRI, demonstrated additive effects on apoptosis in dex-resistant cells.

No differences in Foxp3 expression (T0\u00a0=\u00a00.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 vs T12\u00a0=\u00a00.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12, p\u00a0=\u00a00.5), Treg number (T0\u00a0=\u00a05.62\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.84\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105 vs T12\u00a0=\u00a04.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.62\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105; p\u00a0=\u00a00.3) and Teff percentage (T0\u00a0=\u00a016.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.56% vs T12\u00a0=\u00a013.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) were observed on T12. Low risk MDS patients showed a higher number of Treg (5.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105) versus high risk group (2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Treg suppression activity was impaired on T0 and T12.Cytokine production and IRF-1 expression were increased on T12. The correlation between IRF-1 and FoxP3 was negative (r2\u00a0=\u00a00.317, p\u00a0=\u00a00.045) on T0. These results suggest a hyper activity of the immune system, probably secondary to Treg suppression activity impairment.

Detailed understanding of the mechanisms of GA101-induced cell death is needed to get insight into possible resistance mechanisms occurring in patients. Although multiple in vitro and in vivo mechanisms have been suggested to describe the effects of GA101 on B-cells, currently available data are ambiguous. The aim of our study was to clarify the cellular mechanisms involved in GA101-induced cell death in vitro, and more particularly the respective roles played by lysosomal and mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Our results confirm previous reports suggesting that GA101 triggers homotypic adhesion and caspase-independent cell death, two processes that are dependent on actin remodeling and involve the production of reactive oxygen species. With respect to lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), our data suggest that lack of specificity of available antibodies directed against cathepsin B may have confounded previously published results, possibly challenging current LMP-driven model of GA101 action mode.",

We recently demonstrated that ET-1 has a role in the pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) where it is abnormally expressed. In the context of this malignancy, ET-1 is able to mediate survival, drug-resistance and growth signals in leukemic cells. Previous studies, not conducted in CLL, have shown that ET-1 regulatory mechanisms are numerous and cell specific. Here, we valued the expression of ET-1 in CLL, in relation to DNA methylation but also in response to stimulation of some important pathways for the dialogue between CLL and microenvironment. We found that a high methylation of ET-1 first intron affects the basal expression of ET-1 in CLL. Moreover, we showed that the activation of CD40 or Toll-like receptor (TLR) by extracellular stimuli produces an augment of ET-1 level in CLL cells.

These transformed follicular lymphomas (tFL) are often associated with chemoresistance whose mechanisms are currently unknown. REL, a proto-oncogene located on frequently amplified 2p16.1-p15 locus, promotes tumorigenesis in many cancer types through deregulation of the NF-\u03baB pathway; however, its role in FL pathobiology or chemoresistance has not been addressed. Here, we evaluated REL gene copy number by q-PCR on FFPE FL tumor samples, and observed REL amplification in 30.4% of FL cases that was associated with weak elevation of transcript levels. PCR-Sanger analysis did not show any somatic mutation in FL tumors. In support of a marginal oncogenic role, a REL-transduced FL cell line was positively selected under limiting serum conditions. Interestingly, reanalysis of previously reported gene expression profiles revealed significant enrichment of DNA damage-induced repair and cell cycle arrest pathways in tFL tumors with high REL expression compared to those with low REL expression consistent with the critical role of c-REL in genotoxicity-induced NF-\u03baB signaling, which was reported to lead to drug resistance. In addition to DNA damage repair genes such as ATM and BRCA1, anti-apoptotic BCL2 was significantly elevated in REL-high FL and tFL tumors. Altogether these data suggest that other genes located in amplified 2p16.1-p15 locus may have more oncogenic role in FL etiology; however, high REL expression may be useful as a predictive biomarker of response to immunochemotherapy, and inhibition of c-REL may potentially sensitize resistant FL or tFL cells to chemotherapy.",

In this study, we investigated the roles of an RNA binding protein MSI2 as a regulator of FLT3 expression. MSI2 and FLT3 are significantly co-regulated in human AML and chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis (BC-CML). Genetic loss of MSI2 leads to down-regulation of the FLT3 receptor in both AML and BC-CML cells and concomitant impairment of clonogenic growth potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MSI2 protein is physically bound to FLT3 mRNA transcripts, suggesting post-transcriptional control of FLT3 expression. Collectively, these results reveal a novel mode of FLT3 regulation essential for leukemia growth, which may aid in designing a targeted therapy to treat human myeloid leukemia.",

     "abstract": "Myelofibrosis is a chronic and progressive myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by anemia, splenomegaly, debilitating symptoms and leukemic transformation. Ruxolitinib, an oral JAK1/2 inhibitor, is highly effective in ameliorating systemic symptoms and reducing splenomegaly. Current clinical research is focused on the evaluation of agents based on pre-clinical rationale that can result in disease course modification. Panobinostat is a pan-histone deacetylase inhibitor that has demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent in early phase trials of myelofibrosis. We previously conducted a phase I trial of panobinostat monotherapy in patients with myelofibrosis and determined 25\u00a0mg thrice weekly as the recommended phase II dose. We then completed an investigator initiated, Simon 2-stage, phase II trial of 22 myelofibrosis patients at our single institution. After 6 cycles of therapy, the overall response rate by IWG-MRT criteria was 36% (8/22; 95% CI: 16\u201356%). The median percent reduction in spleen volume was 34% (range, 1.6%\u201373%) in eight evaluable patients. The average reduction in JAK2V617F allele burden was 6.8% (Range; \u22124.0% to 20.2%) and one patient obtained a complete molecular response. Six patients remained on therapy in the extension phase for a median of 18 months (range, 7\u201344). Treatment discontinuation was frequent due to patient/physician perception of therapy ineffectiveness. The optimal dosing of panobinostat for the treatment of MF remains somewhat ill-defined but appears to be most effective and better tolerated when administered at lower doses over a prolonged duration of therapy.",

It can occur as an exclusively extramedullary form or it can be associated with an acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) or a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) at onset or at relapse. The rarity of MS does not enable prospective clinical trials and therefore a specific multicenter register can be useful for the clinical and biological studies of this rare disease.we report the clinical characteristics and outcome of 48 histologically confirmed MS, diagnosed and treated in 9 Italian Hematological Centers in the last 10 years. The patient\u2019s median age was 46 years. There were 9/48 de novo extramedullary MS, 24/48 de novo AML-related MS and 15/48 were secondary AML-related MS. The most common extramedullary anatomic sites of disease were: skin, lymph nodes and soft tissues. Forty-three patients (90%) underwent a program of intensive chemotherapy including FLAI, HDAC-IDA, HyperCVAD and MEC schemes, with a DDI of 5% and a CR Rate of 45%. Twenty-two (46%) patients underwent Allogeneic SCT, 13 from a MUD, 8 from an HLA-identical sibling donor and 1 from an haploidentical donor. The median OS of the whole population (48 pts) was 16.7 months. The OS probability at 1, 2 and 5 years was 64%, 39% and 33%, respectively. The OS was better in patients that underwent an intensive therapeutic program (median OS: 18 months vs 5 months). Among the intensively treated patients, in univariate analysis, the OS was better in young patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00,008), in patients that underwent Allo-SCT (P\u00a0=\u00a00,009) and in patients that achieved a CR during treatment (P\u00a0=\u00a00,001), and was worse in pts with secondary AML-related MS (P\u00a0=\u00a00,007).

In multivariable analysis, Allo-SCT and response to intensive chemotherapy remained significant in predicting a better OS (P\u00a0=\u00a00,04 and P\u00a0=\u00a00,001, respectively), and response to intensive chemotherapy was the only significant variable in predicting DFS (P\u00a0=\u00a00,01).

We assessed the clinical feasibility of using combined HTS and bioinformatics analysis with interactive visualization using Vidjil software. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of HTS for monitoring MRD. HTS gives a more complete insight of the leukemic population than conventional real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), and allows identification of new emerging clones at each time point of the monitoring.

Utilizing a computational biology program, genomic abnormalities in each patient were used to create an intracellular pathway map that was then used to screen for drug response. In the lenalidomide treated cohort, computer modeling correctly matched clinical responses in 37/46 patients (80%). In the second cohort, 15 HMA patients were modeled and correctly matched to responses in 12 (80%). In the third cohort, computer modeling correctly matched responses in 10/10 patients (100%). This computational biology network approach identified GGH overexpression as a potential resistance factor to HMA treatment and paradoxical activation of beta-catenin (through Csnk1a1 inhibition) as a resistance factor to lenalidomide treatment. We demonstrate that a computational technology is able to map the complexity of the MDS mutanome to simulate and predict drug response. This tool can improve understanding of MDS biology and mechanisms of drug sensitivity and resistance.",

In the present study, we have assessed the in vitro effects of Casiopeina III-Ea, a copper-containing small molecule, on cells from patients with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML).

Bone marrow cells obtained from normal individuals \u2013 both total mononuclear cells as well as CD34+ Lin\u2212 cells- were used as controls. IC50 corresponded to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM for K562 cells, 0.63\u00a0\u03bcM for MEG01 cells, 0.38\u00a0\u03bcM for CML CD34+ lin\u2212 cells, and 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM for normal CD34+ lin\u2212 cells. Proliferation and expansion were also inhibited to significantly higher extents in cultures of CML cells as compared to their normal counterparts. All these effects seemed to occur via a bcr-abl transcription-independent mechanism that involved a delay in cell division, an increase in cell death, generation of Reactive Oxygen Species and changes in cell cycle. Our results demonstrate that Casiopeina III-Ea possesses strong antileukemic activity in vitro, and warrant further preclinical (animal) studies to assess such effects in vivo.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate FLT3-ITD production of ROS at the plasma membrane and ER in the FLT3-ITD expressing AML cell line MV4-11. Receptor trafficking inhibitors; Tunicamycin and Brefeldin A induce ER retention of FLT3-ITD, resulting in a decrease in protein expression of NOX4 and its partner protein p22phox, thus demonstrating the critical importance of FLT3-ITD localization for the generation of pro-survival ROS. NOX-generated ROS contribute to total endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in AML as quantified by flow cytometry using the cell-permeable H2O2-probe Peroxy Orange 1 (PO1). We found that PI3K/AKT signaling only occurs when FLT3-ITD is expressed at the plasma membrane and is required for the production of NOX-generated ROS.

MicroRNA (miR) dysregulation is an important epigenetic mechanism in the pathogenesis and progression of SS. MiR-181 has been shown to inhibit SAMHD1 expression in cell lines and was identified as an important prognostic biomarker in CTCL. However, whether SAMHD1 is down-regulated by miR-181 in primary CD4+ T-cells of SS patients is unknown. Compared to normal CD4+ T-cells, SAMHD1 protein expression is significantly reduced in transformed CD4+ T-cell lines and CD4+ T-cells from SS patients, which inversely correlates with increased miR-181 levels in these cells. Over-expression of miR-181b in primary CD4+ T-cells from healthy donors significantly decreased SAMHD1 protein level, but not mRNA level. In contrast, inhibition of miR-181 in a CD4+ T-cell line significantly increased the level of SAMHD1 protein expression.

In 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) proposed elimination of \u201crefractory anemia\u201d in a more general proposal for reclassification of myeloid neoplasia. A scandal relating to Dr. Rhoads\u2019 possibly unethical medical experiments on anemic patients in Puerto Rico in 1931 and a racially offensive letter he wrote during that period prompted an international incident and Congressional-level inquiry. This dark history, as well as continued terminological problems with refractory anemia, suggest that this hoary term has indeed worn out its usefulness. This article reviews the history of \u201crefractory anemia\u201d and evolution in its use over the past 80 years. Rhoads' personal history, the potentially confusing nature of \u201crefractory anemia\u201d, and the fact that it is possible none of the 100 patients Rhoads described in 1937 actually had MDS all support the new WHO reclassification proposal to eliminate this term.",

Low plus intermediate Sokal score correlated to optimal imatinib responses, as well as OS at 8-years, thus confirming the established role of Sokal score as a prognostic factor in CML patients. Low ABCB1 and high OCT1 mRNA levels were associated with an optimal molecular response, while the inverse levels were associated with non-responders (warning and failure) patients. Our results suggest that ABCB1 and OCT1 mRNA expressions may present biological relevance to identify responder and non-responder patients to imatinib treatment.",

Furthermore, there is still no consensus regarding what stage filtering of variants is performed in the bioinformatics pipeline to produce consistent result sets, the extent of filtering and how this is most optimal performed. We hypothesized that combination of coding transcriptome and exomes enables precise identification of both somatic single nucleotide and indel variants early in the bioinformatics process, superseding the need for extensive annotation and validation from external databases.Exome and RNA-sequencing were performed on diagnosis-remission paired bone marrow samples from 5 cytogenetically normal AML, i.e. sequencing of 20 samples in total. Intersection of rare exome and RNA variants, exclusively found in the diagnostic samples, yielded a median of 6 somatic point mutations and small indels, ranging from 3 to 21. Close correlation between routine diagnostic biomarkers was observed in 29/30 laboratory tests, with the exception of a large FLT3 internal tandem repeat, whereas WT1 with nonsense mutation lacked RNA transcripts. Additionally, the assay revealed mutations in DNMT3A, IDH2, TET2 and IL32 frame shift, not encompassed by routine panel.We thus describe a procedure to effectively reduce observations to a focused subset of high specificity. The approach is applicable to precise screening of both putative driver mutations and, often heterogeneous, discrete patient specific somatic combinations.",

Previously, fenretinide, a well-tolerated vitamin A derivative, has been shown to exert effect on leukemic stem cells, but its actions against myeloma stem-like cells are still unknown. In this study, the effects of fenretinide on myeloma stem-like cells characteristic was comprehensively examined in SP and non-SP (MP) cells of NCI-H929 cell sorted by flow cytometry-based on Hoechst 33342 stain. We find that fenretinide is capable of eradicating MM SP and MP cells, but not normal bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMCs) at physiologically achievable concentrations. Fenretinide alone exerted a selective cytotoxic effect on MM SP cells, as well as in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone. In particular, SP cells were highly sensitive to fenretinide, and in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone in colony formation and apoptosis assays. Accordingly, the apparent fenretinide-induced-apoptosis was linked to the rapid generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Therefore, we propose that fenretinide is a potent agent that targets tumor initiating cells and may be a promising therapeutic agent in MM treatment.",

MVD assessment among subtypes of WHO MDS classification showed that the MVD of RCUD was significantly lower than in other types (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). However, there was no significant difference in VEGF expression according to the subtype of MDS. Although MVD and VEGF expression did not differ between risk groups based on the IPSS, the low risk group tended to have lower expression of angiogenesis-related biomarkers. MDS patients receiving hypomethylating agents had significantly lower MVD expression in responders than in non-responders (6.13\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.38 vs. 9.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.10, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.039). In a consecutive evaluation at the time of diagnosis and 3 months after the initial treatment, the group with a decrease or no change of MVD had a higher response rate compared to that in the group with an increase of MVD (92.9% vs. 58.8%, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.045). Adverse prognostic factors included older age, MDS type other than RCUD, a higher IPSS risk group, and abnormal cytogenetics. Although angiogenesis-related markers did not demonstrate any significant prognostic association with survival, MVD (\u226510\u00a0n/mm2) and a strong expression of VEGF seemed to be associated with lower survival rate.These data suggested that the MVD value might be helpful in predicting responsiveness to treatment, especially in MDS patients treated with hypomethylating agents. Although angiogenesis-related markers including VEGF did not demonstrate a significant association with survival outcomes, we observed that high MVD and strong VEGF expression seemed to be associated with lower survival rate. Therefore, biologic markers related to angiogenesis might have a potential as prognostic factors for MDS patients.",

     "abstract": "In the past decade the introduction of targeted therapies has dramatically transformed the landscape of treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Whether this new therapeutic scenario will modify the current prevalence statistics and natural history of autoimmune cytopenias complicating CLL is still a matter of debate. Here we present a comprehensive review of the literature on this topic, with special emphasis on the incidence of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA). The potential to induce autoimmune cytopenia has been studied mostly with ibrutinib, a first- in-class bruton kinase (BTK) inhibitor, licensed for the treatment of relapsed/refractory high-risk CLL. Recent observations suggest that emergent AIHA occurring during therapy with ibrutinib is more an expression of CLL activity than an ibrutinib-mediated process. Since available information on AIHA occurring during and after therapy with small-molecule kinase inhibitors relies mainly on data collected from clinical trials, a close post- marketing surveillance is mandatory in order to improve our understanding of this topic.",

Further, effective treatment strategies for relapsed/refractory ALL remain elusive. We previously uncovered that ALL cells are prone to apoptosis via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR)-mediated mechanisms. We investigated the antineoplastic activity of pevonedistat\u00ae, a novel NEDD8-activating enzyme inhibitor that targets E3 cullin-RING ligases (CRLs) dependent proteasomal protein degradation, in ALL. Herein, we report that pevonedistat induces apoptosis in ALL cells by dysregulating the translational machinery leading to induction of proteotoxic/ER stress and UPR-mediated cell death. Mechanistically, pevonedistat led to P-eIF2a dephosphorylation causing atypical proteotoxic/ER stress from failure to halt protein translation via the UPR and upregulation of mTOR/p70S6K. Additional studies revealed that pevonedistat re-balanced the homeostasis of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins to favor cell death through altered expression and/or activity of Mcl-1, NOXA, and BIM, suggesting that pevonedistat has a \u201cpriming\u201d effect on ALL by altering the apoptotic threshold through modulation of Mcl-1 activity. Further, we demonstrated that pevonedistat synergizes with selected anti-leukemic agents in vitro, and prolongs survival of NSG mice engrafted with ALL cells, lending support for the use of pevonedistat as part of a multi-agent approach.",

Our analysis included 10 patients, with a median age of 39 years (range 20\u201372), male predominance (90%), and a typical B-cell to T-cell ratio (70:30%) for ALL. Nine patients were switched to Erwinia asparaginase after pegaspargase hypersensitivity and one patient after grade 4 hyperbilirubinemia secondary to pegaspargase. With Erwinia asparaginase, no hypersensitivity reactions occurred and no patient developed other known clinical asparaginase-related toxicities. Laboratory adverse effects consisted of mostly mild elevation in liver enzymes. No morphologic relapses have occurred in any patient switched to Erwinia asparaginase in first remission at a follow up of 0.4\u201334.6 months. These findings are unique in that all of our patients received Erwinia asparaginase after hypersensitivity or intolerance to pegaspargase and 50% of them were older than 40 years of age, a population with very limited Erwinia asparaginase data.

However, recurrent contact with CLL cells in a stromal microenvironment leads to increased aerobic glycolysis and the cells\u2019 overall glycolytic capacity, which promotes cell survival and proliferation. TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) has been directly implicated in cellular metabolism in the control of glycolysis. TIGAR inhibits glycolysis and protects cells from intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated apoptosis.TIGAR mRNA expression was investigated by quantitative PCR in 102 newly diagnosed CLL patients. Furthermore, the relationship between the expression of TIGAR and its clinical characteristics and prognosis were investigated. Moreover, we also investigated the correlation between TIGAR expression and apoptosis in primary CLL cells.Our data revealed that TIGAR overexpression was correlated with the protection from spontaneous apoptosis in CLL cells, and is strongly associated with advanced Binet stage, unmutated immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) status, CD38 positivity, \u03b22-microglobulin and p53 aberrations. Higher expression of TIGAR was associated with shorter treatment-free survival (median: three months vs. 51 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0108), worse overall survival (median: 74 months vs. not reached, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0242), and the diverse responses to fludarabine-based chemotherapy.

In the current study, we systemically measured VEGF levels in POEMS patients, before and after treatment. Bone marrow plasma cells showed remarkable VEGF expression, in both mRNA and protein levels, which decreased gradually in response to therapy. Of note, statistically linear correlations were observed between serum and bone marrow plasma cell VEGF levels (mRNA vs. serum, rho 0.343, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003; protein vs. serum, rho 0.644, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), supporting bone marrow plasma cells as the main source of circulating VEGF.

A clear monoclonal population, coexistent with polytypic cells, was only detectable in 11 cases (18%), in which comparable intracellular VEGF expression was observed between these two plasma cell populations (p\u00a0=\u00a00.594), while monoclonal cells showed higher intracellular interleukin-6 expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

Although the transcriptional reactivation of NR4A3 is considered to have a broad-spectrum anti-leukemic effect, the therapeutic modalities targeting this gene have been hindered by our minimal understanding of the transcriptional mechanisms regulating its expression, particularly in human AML. Here we show the role of intragenic DNA hypermethylation in reducing the expression of NR4A3 in AML. Bisulfite sequencing analysis revealed that CpG sites at the intragenic region encompassing exon 3 of NR4A3, but not the promoter region, are hypermethylated in AML cell lines and primary AML cells. A DNA methyltransferase inhibitor restored the expression of NR4A3 following a reduction in DNA methylation levels at intragenic CpG sites. The in silico data revealed an enrichment of H3K4me1 and H2A.Z at exon 3 of NR4A3 in human non-malignant cells but that was excluded specifically in leukemia cells with CpG hypermethylation. This suggests that exon 3 represents a functional regulatory element involved in the transcriptional regulation of NR4A3. Our findings improve the current understanding of the mechanism underlying NR4A3 silencing and facilitate the development of NR4A3-targeted therapy.",

Functionally, we found that DIXDC1 could promote cell proliferation via modulating cell cycle progression and PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in NHLs. Moreover, we confirmed that DIXDC1 was involved in the process of lymphoma cell adhesion mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Adhesion to fibronectin (FN) or HS-5 up-regulated DIXDC1 expression, and up-regulation of DIXDC1 resulted in an increased expression of p-AKT, which promoted CAM-DR. Our finding supports the role of DIXDC1 in cell proliferation, cell cycle and CAM-DR in NHLs. We propose that inhibition of DIXDC1 expression may be a novel therapeutic approach for NHLs patients, and it may be a target for drug resistance.",

     "abstract": "There is no cross-resistance between arsenic trioxide and conventional chemotherapeutics. Classical multi-drug resistant (MDR) cells remain sensitive to arsenic trioxide, which may even reverse the drug resistance. Arsenic trioxide is also effective in leukemias/tumors that persist despite conventional cytotoxic or targeted drugs. We obtained a highly arsenic-resistant MDR leukemic cell line, HL-60/RS, by exposing leukemic HL-60 cells to adriamycin selection. We compared the arsenic sensitivity, and the expression and responses to arsenic of the arsenic-related transporters, MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1, in paired parent/arsenic-resistant HL-60/RS/HL-60 and arsenic-sensitive/parental K562/ADM/K562 cells. Expression levels of MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1 were negatively correlated with cell sensitivities to arsenic trioxide, and ASNA1 expression notably was highest in HL-60/RS cells and lowest in K562/ADM cells. Expression levels of MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1 were significantly enhanced in HL-60/RS cells and inhibited in K562/ADM cells by arsenic trioxide treatment, compared with their parental sensitive cells, in accord with the high-resistance of HL-60/RS cells and high-sensitivity of K562/ADM cells. In conclusion, the cross-resistance of conventional chemotherapeutics-resistant leukemic cells to arsenic trioxide is determined by both levels of MRP1, MRP2, and ASNA1, and also by the responses of these transporters to arsenic stress.",

     "abstract": "Current therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) primarily includes high-dose cytotoxic chemotherapy with or without allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Targeting unique cellular metabolism of cancer cells is a potentially less toxic approach. Monotherapy with mitochondrial inhibitors like metformin have met with limited success since escape mechanisms such as increased glycolytic ATP production, especially in hyperglycemia, can overcome the metabolic blockade. As an alternative strategy for metformin therapy, we hypothesized that the combination of 6-benzylthioinosine (6-BT), a broad-spectrum metabolic inhibitor, and metformin could block this drug resistance mechanism. Metformin treatment alone resulted in significant suppression of ROS and mitochondrial respiration with increased glycolysis accompanied by modest cytotoxicity (10\u201325%). In contrast, 6-BT monotherapy resulted in inhibition of glucose uptake, decreased glycolysis, and decreased ATP with minimal changes in ROS and mitochondrial respiration. The combination of 6-BT with metformin resulted in significant cytotoxicity (60\u201370%) in monocytic AML cell lines and was associated with inhibition of FLT3-ITD activated STAT5 and reduced c-Myc and GLUT-1 expression. Therefore, although the anti-tumor and metabolic effects of metformin have been limited by the metabolic reprogramming within cells, the novel combination of 6-BT and metformin targets this bypass mechanism resulting in reduced glycolysis, STAT5 inhibition, and increased cell death.",

In mice, administration of azacitidine (AzaC) on days 4, 6, 8, and 10 post DLI increases regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers and prevents GVHD without hindering Graft vs. Leukemia (GVL). Based on these findings, we conducted a phase 1 study of AzaC post DLI for AML relapse post allo-SCT. AzaC was administered on days 4, 6, 8 and 10 post-DLI. Dose escalation was done using a 3\u00a0+\u00a03 design with three AzaC dose levels: 30\u00a0mg/m2 (level \u22121), 45\u00a0mg/m2 (level 1) and 75\u00a0mg/m2 (level 2). Three patients were treated in the 45\u00a0mg/m2 dose level and 5 patients were treated in the 75\u00a0mg/m2 dose level; no DLTs or grade 3\u20135 treatment related toxicities were observed. After a median follow-up of 5.2 months, no patients developed grade III\u2013IV aGVHD and no patients died of aGVHD. Six out of 8 patients in the treatment group responded to treatment including two cytogenetic complete remissions, one hematologic complete remission, and three complete remissions with incomplete count recovery. In conclusion, administration of AzaC early post DLI is well tolerated and can potentially prevent GVHD after DLI.

Results: We observed an increased percentage of IgD+CD27+ B cells in healthy controls vs responding patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Treated non complete responders exhibited an expanded DN compartment vs stringent complete responders (p\u00a0=\u00a00.011); in turn IgD+CD27\u2212 subpopulation was larger in stringent complete responders vs other responding patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

CIK cells were generated in vitro from donor peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and were phenotyped using flow cytometric analysis. CIK cells were administered to 15 high-risk relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancy patients who were not in complete remission in multiple infusions. These patients also received allogeneic HSCT. The side effects and outcomes were recorded. All patients achieved engraftment and complete remission. After CIK cell infusion, two patients developed graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), which was controlled by additional immunosuppressant drugs. At the last follow-up, nine patients had died and six patients were surviving at a median follow-up of 1513\u00a0days (range, 771\u20131655\u00a0days).

Multivariate analyses allowed adjustment for covariates potentially related to changes in dosing or an event. Logistic regression analysis identified significant associations between dose intensity and most events after adjusting for covariates. Pancreatitis, rash, and cardiac failure had the strongest associations with dose intensity (odds ratios >2). Time-to-event analyses showed significant associations between dose intensity and risk of arterial occlusive events and each subcategory. Further, these analyses suggested that a lag exists between a change in dose and the resulting change in event risk. No significant association between dose intensity and risk of venous thromboembolic events was evident. Collectively, these findings suggest a potential causal relationship between ponatinib dose and certain adverse events and support prospective investigations of approaches to lower average ponatinib dose intensity.",

Acquisition of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors has emerged as a problem for CML patients and the identification of novel targets with an important contribution for CML phenotype is of interest. In the present study, we explored the cellular effects of reversine, an AURKA and AURKB inhibitor, in the BCR-ABL1+ K562 cells. Our results indicate that reversine reduces AURKA and AURKB expression, leads to reduction of cell viability and increased apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as well as, induces mitotic catastrophe in K562 cells.

     "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a serious obstacle to the effective chemotherapeutic treatment of leukemia. Expression of plasma membrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a transporter involved in drug efflux, is the most frequently observed molecular causality of MDR. We observed the coexpression of P-gp and the filament protein nestin in the acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines SKM-1 and MOLM-13 following the induction of P-gp expression using vincristine. Nestin is considered a marker of neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is causal relationship between the expression of P-glycoprotein and the expression of nestin in both of these AML cell lines. The expression of P-gp was induced in SKM-1 cells by selective pressure using vincristine (VCR), mitoxantrone (MTX), azacytidine (AzaC) and lenalidomide (LEN). Whereas the selective pressure of VCR, MTX and AzaC also induced P-gp expression in MOLM-13 cells, LEN was found to be ineffective in this regard. In all cases in which P-gp expression was induced in SKM-1 and MOLM-13 cells, its expression was associated with the induction of nestin mRNA expression and the presence of a 200\u2013220\u00a0kDa nestin-immunoreactive protein band in western blots. Silencing P-gp expression using s10418 siRNA (known as the P-gp silencer) was associated with the downregulation of the nestin transcript level, demonstrated using RT-PCR. Nestin mRNA was also observed in two P-gp-positive variants of L1210 cells that were obtained either by selection with VCR or by transfection with a retrovirus encoding human P-gp. Detectable levels of nestin transcripts were not observed in P-gp-negative parental L1210 cells. Taken together, these results indicated that the induction of P-gp expression is causally associated with the expression of nestin in leukemia cells.",

Interestingly, 55% of the cases negative by standard analysis, but containing a FLOCK-identified discrete plasma cell population, were positive for monoclonal gammopathy by serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation. FLOCK-identified and quantitated plasma cell populations accounted for 3.05% of total cells on average in cases positive for involvement by a plasma cell neoplasm by standard histologic and immunophenotypic criteria, and 0.27% of total cells on average in cases negative for involvement by a plasma cell neoplasm by standard histologic and immunophenotypic criteria (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; area under the curve by ROC analysis\u00a0=\u00a00.96).

While AML1-ETO prolongs survival and inhibits differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), other contributory events are needed for cell proliferation and leukemogenesis. We have postulated that specific tumor suppressor genes keep the leukemic potential of AML1-ETO in check. In studying del(9q), one of the most common concomitant chromosomal abnormalities with t(8;21), we identified the loss of an apparent tumor suppressor, TLE4, that appears to cooperate with AML1-ETO to confer a leukemic phenotype. This study sought to identify the molecular basis of this cooperation. We show that the loss of TLE4 confers proliferative advantage to leukemic cells, simultaneous with an upregulation of a pro- inflammatory signature mediated through aberrant increases in Wnt signaling activity. We further demonstrate that inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity partly reverses the pro-leukemic phenotype due to TLE4 knockdown, pointing towards a novel therapeutic approach for myeloid leukemia.",

Double strand breaks (DSB) lesions are the most severe type of DNA damage in HSCs, which, if not properly repaired, might contribute to the development of chromosomal abnormalities, which in turn may lead to leukemia development. We assessed the mRNA expression levels of ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, XRCC5, XRCC6 and LIG4 genes in bone marrow samples of 47 MDS patients in order to evaluate the association with functional polymorphisms rs228593, rs4793191, rs9567623, rs1801320, rs3835, rs2267437 and rs1805388, respectively, and try to detect clinical associations.

Sixteen adult patients with T-AML during first complete remission after malignant disease received allo-HCT at the Peking University Institute of Hematology between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2014. Eighty patients with de novo AML were selected using the case-pair method. The 3-year overall survival and leukemia-free survival for T-AML versus de novo AML patients were 66% vs. 79% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.14) and 64% vs. 77% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.13), respectively. The 3-year cumulative non-relapse mortality rates for T-AML versus de novo AML patients were 13% vs. 9% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.47), respectively; the relapse rates were 20% vs. 13% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.25), respectively. Our results suggest that the prognosis of T-AML is comparable to that of de novo AML after transplantation. Although T-AML shows poorer prognosis than de novo AML after conventional therapies, allo-HCT can markedly improve the prognosis of T-AML.",

Although allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is considered the mainstay of the treatment for both subtypes of leukemia due to their refractoriness to chemotherapy and high rates of relapse, it remains unclear whether allo-HSCT is curative in such cases due to their scarcity. We retrospectively examined the impact of allo-HSCT in 382 patients with M6 and 108 patients with M7 using nationwide HSCT data and found the overall survival (OS) and relapse rates of the M6 patients to be significantly better than those of the M7 patients after adjusting for confounding factors and statistically comparable with those of the patients with M0/M1/M2/M4/M5 disease. Consequently, the factors of age, gender, performance status, karyotype, disease status at HSCT and development of graft-vs.-host disease predicted the OS for the M6 patients, while the performance status and disease status at HSCT were predictive of the OS for the M7 patients. These findings substantiate the importance of distinguishing between M6 and M7 in the HSCT setting and suggest that unknown mechanisms influence the HSCT outcomes of these closely related subtypes of leukemia.",

This study attempted to investigate the prevalence of microMKs and associated marrow fibrosis in patients with thrombocytopenia unrelated to MDS/RCC and the need for establishing a threshold for microMKs for the diagnosis of MDS/RCC.Bone marrow biopsies of pediatric patients with thrombocytopenia unrelated to RCC were examined for microMKs and fibrosis by CD61 immunohistochemical and reticulin stains respectively.Thirty eight patients (1\u201318 years old) were included: 33 immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), 3 chronic thrombocytopenia, and 2 inherited macrothrombocytopenia. Fourteen cases (37%) had microMKs; four cases showed increased marrow fibrosis associated with microMKs (two had ITP and two had macrothrombocytopenia). All patients are alive and none developed MDS (follow up: 3months to 4 years).MicroMKs can be seen in pediatric patients with thrombocytopenia unrelated to RCC.

Therefore, we hypothesized that lower doses of sMTX [very-short-term MTX (vsMTX): 10 and 7\u00a0mg/m2 on days 1 and 3, respectively] with TAC reduce the risk of GF without increasing post-transplantation immune reactions during CBT.

No cases of primary graft failure were noted. The cumulative incidence of grades II\u2013III GVHD was 48.1% at day 100, and the cumulative 100-day incidence of nonrelapse mortality was 12.5%. This study suggests that TAC with vsMTX reduces the risk of PIR and ES during CBT and stimulates neutrophil engraftment, but may be associated with slightly higher aGVHD compared with calcineurin inhibitor and sMTX.

In both cellular models, cell cycle progression was globally inhibited by DXM and/or ibrutinib. This inhibition was significantly amplified by DXM addition to ibrutinib and was related to a significant decrease in the expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins CDK4 and cyclin E. Apoptosis increased especially with DXM/ibrutinib combination and was associated with a significant decrease in Mcl-1 expression. Treatment effects on metabolic stress were evaluated by DNA damage recognition after 53BP1 foci labeling. The percentage of cells with more than five 53BP1 foci decreased significantly with ibrutinib in normal and CLL lymphocytes. This decrease was strongly reinforced, in CLL, by DXM addition.

We found that ceramide level was significantly lower in BP-CML CD34 compared with normal BM counterparts. BP-CML CD34 ceramidelow were more resistant to BCR-ABL TKIs compared to BP-CML CD34 ceramidenormal. Both mRNA and proteins levels of sphingomyelin synthase 1 and 2 are lower in BP-CML CD34 ceramidelow compared to normal BM CD34 cells, suggesting that these two ceramide synthesis enzymes maybe the mechanism of how ceramide level is suppressed.

     "abstract": "We recently described the development of an inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a CBL mutated clonal hematopoiesis. Here, we further characterized the clonal composition and evolution of the AML based on the genetic information from the bulk specimen and analyses of individual bone marrow cells for mutations in CAND1, PTPRT, and DOCK6. To control for allele dropout, heterozygous polymorphisms located close to the respective mutation loci were assessed in parallel. The clonal composition concluded from exome sequencing suggested a proliferation advantage associated with the acquisition of mutations in CAND1, PTPRT, and DOCK6. Out of 102 single cell sequencing reactions on these mutations and the respective polymorphisms, analyses yielded conclusive results for at least 2 mutation sites in 12 cells. The single cell genotyping not only confirmed the co-occurrence of the PTPRT, CAND1 and DOCK6 mutations in the same AML clone but also revealed a clonal hierarchy, as the PTPRT mutation was likely acquired after the CAND1 and DOCK6 mutations. This insight had not been possible based solely on the exome sequencing data and suggests that the mutation in PTPRT, which encodes a STAT3-inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase, contributed to the AML development at a later stage by enhancing proliferation.",

However, its role in human multiple myeloma (MM) has not been thoroughly elucidated. In this study, we investigate the role of CHD1L in MM. Preliminarily, up-regulation and down-regulation assay verified that CHD1L exerts its anti-apoptotic role through the apoptotic pathway involving caspase-9\u2013caspase-3 apoptotic pathway in MM cells. In addition, we determined that CHD1L expression is increased when MM cells were adhered to fibronectin (FN) or bone marrow stromal cell line HS-5 cells and cell adhesion assay indicated that CHD1L siRNA reversed the high cell adhesion rate. Consistent with the reduced adhesion rate, the cells translated to a compromised cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) phenotype in MM. In summary, we will propose strategies for developing a CHD1L inhibitor for potential treatment of MM.",

     "abstract": "Downregulation of p53 is associated with most of the neoplasms, however it claims additional significance for hematopoietic malignancy due to its supplementary role during hematopoiesis. Apart from the classical role as tumor suppressor, p53 during steady state hematopoiesis is associated with the maintenance of quiescent cell population in bone marrow by upregulating necdin (Ndn) and Gfi-1. We felt, it is necessary to delineate its attribution towards malignant conversion of hematopoietic system during leukemogenesis from all the possible angles. The present study deals with the characterization of N-N\u2032 Ethylnitrosourea (ENU) induced mouse model of leukemia by peripheral blood hemogram, bone marrow cytology, histology, cytochemical staining (MPO) and scanning electron microscopic study. We further investigated the alteration of conventional and hematopoiesis specific p53 pathways by flowcytometric expressional analysis of ATM, Chk-2, p53, p21, Ndn, Gfi-1 and Tie-2. The disruption of classical p53 pathway was observed in leukemic hematopoietic stem/progenitor population which involved downregulation of ATM, Chk-2, p53 and p21. Moreover, the expressional decline of Ndn and Gfi-1 hinted towards the mechanism of hindrance of hematopoietic quiescency in leukemic bone marrow. Increased expression of Tie-2 due to reverse correlation with p53 was found to be responsible for pathological angiogenesis in bone marrow together with increased blast burden in bone marrow during leukemia. The study presents the mechanistic scenario of the alteration of both classical as well as hematopoiesis specific p53 pathways in HSPC compartment triggering leukemic pathophysiology.",

BCL11A encodes a transcription factor and is aberrantly-expressed in several haematological and solid neoplasms. We analyzed BCL11A mRNA levels in subjects with chronic and acute phase CML. BCL11A transcript levels were increased in subjects with CML in acute phase compared with those in normals and in subjects in chronic phase including some subjects studied in both phases. BCL11A mRNA levels were correlated with percent bone marrow blasts and significantly higher in lymphoid versus myeloid blast crisis. Differentiation of K562 with butyric acid, a CML cell line, decreased BCL11A mRNA levels. Cytology and flow cytometry analyses showed that ectopic expression of BCL11A in K562 cells blocked differentiation. These data suggest BCL11A may operate in transformation of CML from chronic to acute phase in some persons.",

We investigated the synergism of fludarabine (Flu), clofarabine (Clo), busulfan (Bu), and romidepsin (Rom) in T-cell lines and patient-derived cell samples. [Flu\u00a0+\u00a0Clo\u00a0+\u00a0Bu\u00a0+\u00a0Rom] had combination indexes of 0.4\u20130.5 at \u223c50% cytotoxicity in PEER and SUPT1 cells, suggesting synergism. Drug exposure resulted in histone modifications, DNA-damage response (DDR), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased glutathione (GSH) and mitochondrial membrane (MM) potential, and apoptosis. Similar activation of DDR and apoptosis was observed in patient samples. The PI3K-AKT-mTOR, NF\u03baB, Raf-MEK-ERK, JAK-STAT and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pro-survival pathways were inhibited by the 4-drug combination. The SAPK/JNK stress pathway was activated. A novel finding was the down-regulation of the drug transporter MRP1. We propose the following mechanisms of synergism: Flu, Clo and Rom induce histone modifications and chromatin remodeling, exposing DNA to Bu alkylation; the increased production of ROS, due to drug-mediated stress response and decreased GSH, damages the MM causing leakage of pro-apoptotic factors; down-regulation of MRP1 increases intracellular Bu concentration and exacerbates the DDR; and inhibition of multiple survival pathways.

     "abstract": "Aberrant hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is known to play an important role in the development of many tumors, and aberrant DNA hypermethylation was recently identified in hematologic malignancies, where it is thought to hold relevance in leukemogenesis. Here, we report that there are differences in the DNA methylation patterns seen in normal peripheral blood and two T-cell leukemia cell lines. We identify nine genes (CLEC4E, CR1, DBC1, EPO, HAL-DOA, IGF2, IL12B, ITGA1, and LMX1B) that are significantly hypermethylated in T-cell leukemias cell lines, and suggest that aberrant hypermethylation of these normally unmethylated genes may induce their transcriptional and expressional silencing. Furthermore, we observed that the expression levels of DNMT1 and DNMT3a were significantly decreased by 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC), which is a demethylation agent known to deplete DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) in leukemia cancer cells and restore the expression levels of their target genes in Jurkat cells. This result suggests that the overexpression of DNMTs could contribute to the development of T-cell leukemias by inducing hypermethylation of the target genes. Together, our results show that aberrant hypermethylation is an important molecular mechanism in the progression of T-cell leukemias, and thus could prove useful as a prognostic and/or diagnostic marker. Moreover, 5-Aza-dC might be a promising candidate for the treatment of T-cell leukemia.",

PrTh occurred in 194 (19.9%) patients, with similar rates in the different MPNs. In multivariate analysis, PrTh rate was significantly related to minor thrombocytosis (platelets \u2264700\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L), leukocytosis (leukocytes\u2009>10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L), higher hematocrit (HCT\u2009>45%), JAK2 V617F mutation, older age, and cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). The highest PrTh rate (33.9%) was associated with the coexistence of minor thrombocytosis and leukocytosis. Of note, the inverse relationship between PrTh rate and platelet count is consistent with the hemostatic paradox of thrombocytosis. In conclusion, this analysis in MPN patients disclosed the unbiased characteristics at diagnosis with a pro-thrombotic effect.

Between 2006 and 2011 we implemented a treatment algorithm for all newly diagnosed AML patients aged 61\u201375 years, consisting of intensive chemotherapy cycles to induce complete remission, followed by alloSCT. 44 of 60 (73%) newly diagnosed elderly AML patients started with chemotherapy. By meticulously following our algorithm in almost all patients, we could induce complete remission (CR) in 66% of patients starting with chemotherapy, and transplant 32% of these patients in continuous CR. Main reasons for failure were early relapse (16%), early death (14%), primary refractory disease (9%), and patient or physician decision to stop treatment (16%). Patients in continuous CR after first induction benefit most with 36% long-term survival. Patients not in CR after first induction benefit less; although additional chemotherapy induces CR in 45% of these patients, only 23% are transplanted and no long-term survival is observed, mainly due to relapse. Long-term survival in the group of 44 patients is 9% (median 4.5 years after alloSCT). Considering that 27% of patients do not start with chemotherapy and 64% of patients starting with chemotherapy do not reach alloSCT, the reasons for failure presented here should be used as a guide to develop new treatment algorithms to improve long-term survival in elderly AML patients.",

     "abstract": "Although bone marrow evaluation on day 14 after initiation of induction chemotherapy (D14 BM) is a widely accepted practice in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), it has suboptimal predictive value for predicting complete remission. We retrospectively analyzed pretreatment characteristics and post-induction response in a cohort of AML patients to determine if adding clinical and laboratory characteristics can improve the predictive value of the D14 BM evaluation. Among 297 patients treated for AML at the single institution 183 patients (61%) had leukemia-positive D14 BM. Of those, 94 were given reinduction chemotherapy and 89 were not. Of the 89 patients who did not receive reinduction, 32 (36%) subsequently achieved complete remission (CR) or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (CRi), and 57 (64%) had persistent disease. Persistent disease after positive D14 BM was more likely associated with higher percentage of D14 myeloblasts, a history of relapsed disease before induction, and higher risk disease compared to patients who subsequently achieved CR. Age, diagnostic white blood cell count, and the D14 BM cellularity did not influence the subsequent likelihood of achieving remission in patients with a positive D14 BM. A new mathematical equation was created and resulted in a positive predictive value of 83%, negative predictive value 90% and accuracy 88% for correctly identifying remission status after positive D14 BM in AML. The accuracy of predicting response using these additional parameters was significantly higher than without (0.88 vs. 0.80, P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). Our new model provides better accuracy for predicting the likelihood of achieving remission and if validated in future studies may be useful for managing AML patients.",

We administered CLAG-based chemotherapy to 20 previously untreated AML patients who were poor candidates for standard induction therapy. Responding patients received further CLAG as post-remission therapy followed by additional therapy that was tailored to their AML subtype. Patients were considered poor candidates for standard therapy due to either cardiac disease, prior chemotherapy for another malignancy, prior myeloproliferative disease, or myelodysplastic syndrome that had progressed after hypomethylator therapy. Overall, thirteen patients had a complete response (CR) to the first cycle of therapy (65%), one patient had a CR without platelet recovery, and 3 patients had a partial response (PR). Two of the patients with PR converted to CR after further therapy. The median duration of response has not been reached; the mean duration of response is 36.8 months (95% CI 28.8\u201344.8 months). Median overall survival (including deaths from all causes) is 29.0 months (95% CI 18.0\u201346.0 months). Patients with de novo AML had a CR rate of 90.9% and a median overall survival of 38.5 months. CLAG-based therapy is a well-tolerated, efficacious induction strategy in previously-untreated patients with high risk AML. CLAG-based regimens should be studied in a broader group of newly diagnosed AML patients.",

The role of Zfp521 in B-cell differentiation, and the mechanisms by which it leads to leukemic transformation, are unclear. In this study we report that Zfp521 knockdown causes apoptosis in a B-cell culture system and promotes down-regulation of genes acting at late stages of B-cell differentiation. We identify Pax5 and cyclin D1 as Zfp521 target genes, and suggest that excessive B-cell proliferation observed in mice with retroviral insertions near the Zfp521 gene is due to an up-regulation of cyclin D1 in B-cells.

The microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of CLL gives additional biological and prognostic information, but its expression in 13q- CLL has not been examined in detail. The miRNA expression of clonal B cell lymphocytes (CD19+ cells) of 38 CLL patients and normal B cells of six healthy donors was analyzed. CLL patients with higher percentages of 13q- cells (\u226580%) showed a different level of miRNA expression from patients with lower percentages (<80%). Interestingly, miR-143 was downregulated and miR-155 was overexpressed in 13q-H. This deregulation affected important validated target genes involved in apoptosis (BCL2, MDM2, TP53INP1) and proliferation (KRAS, PI3K-AKT signaling), that could lead to decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation in 13q-H patients. This study provides new evidence about the heterogeneity of the 13q deletion in CLL patients, showing that miRNA regulation could be involved in several significant pathways deregulated in CLL patients with a high number of losses in 13q.",

     "abstract": "Persistent activation of NF-\u03baB is a prerequisite for development of adult T cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATL) caused by human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). HTLV-1 genome encodes a viral transforming protein named Tax, which constitutively activates the canonical I\u03baB kinases (IKK), the central regulator of NF-\u03baB signaling. However, the role of the non-canonical I\u03baB kinases, TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, in the pathogenesis of HTLV-1-associated leukemia has not been evaluated. We here show that TBK1/IKK\u03b5 are crucial pro-survival molecules by maintaining persistent activity of Stat3. Consistent with this finding, silencing Stat3 by the specific shRNA or by the chemical inhibitor ruxolitinib results in drastic impediment of leukemia cell growth. We further find that in HTLV-1-transformed T cells expressing Tax, TBK1 co-localizes with the canonical I\u03baB kinases and Tax in the lipid raft microdomains. The wild type Tax, but not the Tax mutant defective in activating the canonical IKK, promotes the lipid raft translocation of TBK1. This phenomenon correlates with Tax activation of both NF-\u03baB and Stat3. Tax does not interact directly with TBK1/IKK\u03b5, and it rather engages a molecular crosstalk between the canonical IKKs and TBK1/IKK\u03b5. Our data, therefore, demonstrate a key role of TBK1/IKK\u03b5 in the survival and proliferation of HTLV-1-transformed T cells and implicate a potential therapy targeting TBK1/IKK\u03b5 and Stat3 in controlling HTLV-1-mediated oncogenesis.",

Downstream targets of MLL are aberrantly upregulated and include the developmentally important HOX genes and MEIS1, as well as multiple microRNAs (miRNAs), including the miR-17\u223c92 cluster. Here we examined the contribution of specific miRNAs to MLL leukemias through knockdown studies utilizing custom anti-microRNA oligonucleotides. Combinatorial treatment against miR-17-5p and miR-19a-3p of the miR-17\u223c92 cluster dramatically reduces colony forming ability of MLL-fusion containing cell lines relative to non-MLL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) controls. To determine the mechanism by which these miRNAs contribute to leukemia, we validated PKNOX1 as a target of both miR-17-5p and miR-19a-3p. MEIS1 and PKNOX1 are TALE domain proteins that participate in ternary complexes with HOX and PBX partners. Here we establish the competitive relationship between PKNOX1 and MEIS1 in PBX-containing complex formation and determine the antagonistic role of PKNOX1 to leukemia in a murine MLL-AF9 model. These data implicate the miR-17\u223c92 cluster as part of a regulatory mechanism necessary to maintain MEIS1/HOXA9 \u2212mediated transformation in MLL leukemia, indicating that targeting multiple non-homologous miRNAs may be utilized as a novel therapeutic regimen.",

Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is one of the main pathways for repairing DSBs. Decreased NHEJ activity has been reported with HDACi treatment. However, mechanisms through which these effects are regulated in the context of chromatin are unclear. We show that pan-HDACi, trichostatin A (TSA), causes differential acetylation of DNA repair factors Ku70/Ku80 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase-1 (PARP1), and impairs NHEJ. Repair effects are reversed by treatments with p300/CBP inhibitor C646, with significantly decreased acetylation of PARP1. In keeping with these findings, TSA treatment significantly increases PARP1 binding to DSBs in chromatin. Notably, AML patients treated with HDACi entinostat (MS275) in vivo also show increased formation of poly ADP-ribose (PAR) that co-localizes with DSBs. Further, we demonstrate that PARP1 bound to chromatin increases with duration of TSA exposure, resembling PARP \u201ctrapping\u201d. Knockdown of PARP1 inhibits trapping and mitigates HDACi effects on NHEJ. Finally, combination of HDACi with potent PARP inhibitor talazoparib (BMN673) shows a dose-dependent increase in PARP \u201ctrapping\u201d, which correlates with increased apoptosis. These results provide a mechanism through which HDACi inhibits deacetylation and increases binding of PARP1 to DSBs, leading to decreased NHEJ and cytotoxicity of leukemia cells.",

Lentiviral transduction of the BCR/ABL gene in Ba/F3 cells increased EZH2 levels in parallel with phosphorylation of STAT5. Notably, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that STAT5A bound to a promoter region of the EZH2 gene, resulting in an increase in the transcriptional activity of EZH2 in leukemia cells. Importantly, downregulation of EZH2 by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) inhibited the expression of XIAP and increased the miR-219 levels associated with a decrease in hypermethylation of miR-219-1 CpG islands. Moreover, overexpression of miR-219 decreased the levels of XIAP in CML cells. Since the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of XIAP contains miR219-5p-complementary binding site, miR-219 might modulate the expression of XIAP through binding of miR-219 on the 3\u2032-UTR of XIAP.Taken together, BCR/ABL positively regulates the expression of EZH2 via STAT5 signaling. EZH2 modulates epigenetic changes at DNA methylated regions encoding miR-219 and downregulates the level of miR-219, resulting in upregulation of XIAP.",

Gene Ontology analysis showed that differential regulation of genes involved in pathways for leukemogenesis, apoptosis, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and antigen processing/presentation may offer a survival benefit to TCR\u03b3\u03b4\u00a0+\u00a0T-ALL patients. Genes involved in disease biology and having equal expression in both the subgroups, were further analysed for mutations and CNV using droplet digital PCR. TCR\u03b3\u03b4\u00a0+\u00a0T-ALL patients exhibited differential level of mutations for NOTCH1 and IKZF3; however BRAF mutations were detected at equal levels in both the subgroups. Although TCR\u03b3\u03b4\u00a0+\u00a0T-ALL patients with these mutations demonstrated improved disease-free survival (DFS) as compared TCR\u03b1\u03b2\u00a0+\u00a0T-ALL patients, it was not statistically significant. Patients with homozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B showed poor DFS in each subgroup. TCR\u03b3\u03b4\u00a0+\u00a0T-ALL patients with wild type/heterozygous deletion of CDKN2A/CDKN2B possess significantly better DFS over TCR\u03b1\u03b2\u00a0+\u00a0T-ALL patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017 and 0.045, respectively). Thus, the present study has for the first time demonstrated TCR\u03b3\u03b4 clonality and CDKN2A/CDKN2B CNV together as potential prognostic markers in management of T-ALL. Further understanding the functional significance of differentially regulated genes in T-ALL patients would aid in designing risk based treatment strategies in subset specific manner.",

We found that CCT8 was highly expressed in proliferating germinal center cells compared with the quiescent cells of the follicular mantle zone. Furthermore, CCT8 was highly expressed in progressive lymphomas than in indolent lymphomas. Kaplan-Meier curve showed that high expression of CCT8 was significantly associated with shorter overall survival in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Moreover, we demonstrated that CCT8 could promote the proliferation of B-cell NHL cells. In addition, we found that CCT8 could accelerate the G1/S transition in B-cell NHL. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpression of CCT8 could reverse cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR) phenotype.

However, the upstream and downstream molecules of MEK/ERK signal pathway in this cell model remains to be elucidated. In this work, we showed that RAF-1 was activated and the blockade of RAF-1 activation attenuated MEK/ERK activation as well as ATRA-induced differentiation. ATRA-enhanced protein levels of C/EBP\u03b2, C/EBP\u03b5 and PU.1, which were required for differentiation in APL cells, were suppressed by the specific inhibitor of MEK. However, MEK inhibition had no effect on the degradation of PML-RAR\u03b1 fusion protein or the restoration of PML nuclear bodies by ATRA treatment.

We agreed upon descriptions and provided images of megakaryoblasts and of normal and dysplastic megakaryocytes, which were used as a basis for assessing the concordance of expert morphologists in their recognition. We showed a high rate of concordance for the recognition of micromegakaryocytes and confirmed their strong association with hematologic neoplasia, including MDS. Concordance was also found to be good for the recognition of multinucleated megakaryocytes, which showed a significant association with MDS. However cytoplasmic abnormalities were found not to be useful in MDS recognition. The occurrence of appreciable numbers of nonlobulated and hypolobulated megakaryocytes in individuals without a myeloid neoplasm was confirmed. We demonstrated that subjects without a myeloid neoplasm can have some megakaryocytes that are assessed as \u2018dysplastic\u2019 or \u2018possibly dysplastic\u2019 and that to avoid over diagnosis of dysplasia, \u2018possibly dysplastic\u2019 forms should be excluded from the count of dysplastic cells. Our results demonstrate that the nature as well as the presence of megakaryocyte dysplasia is important in the diagnosis of MDS; although evaluation of 30 megakaryocytes is strongly recommended, it may be possible to recognize diagnostically important dysplasia when fewer megakaryocytes are present but highly diagnostic forms are seen.",

Using HDAC inhibitors, we observed predominantly inactive chromatin conformation (methylated H3 histones H3K9me2) in HACE1 gene promoter region. We demonstrated in Ramos and Raji cells that down-regulation of HACE1 expression was associated with a significant decrease in apoptosis and an accumulation of cells in the S and G2/M phases. Our experiments indicate that HACE1 can act as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene in most B-cell lymphomas and can be downregulated by deacetylation of its promoter region chromatin, which makes HACE1 a potential target for HDAC inhibitors.",

     "abstract": "EZH2 genetic mutations are common in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which implies that this gene has a pathophysiological role in the disease. To further characterize molecular alterations of EZH2, and their potential prognostic impact in MDS, we assessed EZH2 RNA expression in primary bone marrow CD34+ cells from 78 patients.We found that 47% of patients have reduced EZH2 expression compared to normal controls. Further analyses revealed that EZH2 is significantly underexpressed in patients bearing chromosome 7 or 7q deletions (7-alt) when compared to controls, diploid patients, and patients with other cytogenetic alterations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In survival analysis, we found a non-significant trend toward overall survival (OS) being better among patients with EZH2 underexpression (median OS 55 vs. 36 months; p\u00a0=\u00a00.71). Importantly, this trend became significant when the analysis was restricted to the subset of cases without alterations in chromosome 7 (62 vs. 36 months; p\u00a0=\u00a00.033).Furthermore, our previous work has identified a spectrum of innate immune genes in MDS CD34+ cells that are deregulated via abnormal promoter histone methylation. Because EZH2 is a key regulator of histone methylation, we assessed the relationship between deregulation of these genes and EZH2 underexpression. We observed that the mRNA levels of 11 immune genes were higher in the EZH2 underexpression group and that immune gene expression was significantly higher in patients with concomitant EZH2 underexpression and KDM6B (also known as JMJD3, an H3K27 demethylase) overexpression.Taken together, these data indicate that EZH2 underexpression may have unique impact on the molecular pathogenesis and prognosis in MDS and be an important marker for patients without chromosome 7 alteration.",

The differences between the SF3B1 mutated and wild-type subsets, including the ultrastructure of erythroid precursors, iron profile parameters, erythropoiesis-related measurements, as well as clinical features, were analyzed.SF3B1 mutations were detected in 33 out of fifty-two MDS-RS patients (63%). The vast majority of patients with mutations (94%) were categorized in the lower risk group according to the IPSS (International Prognostic Scoring System), in contrast to only fifty-eight percent of the wild-type cases. In addition to the notably higher percentages of erythroblasts and ring sideroblasts in patients with mutations, abundant electron-dense granules in the mitochondria of the erythroid precursors were clearly observed. Moreover, patients with mutations presented both improper iron uptake and distribution (lower serum hepcidin-25 concentration, P\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and enhanced erythropoietic activity (higher soluble transferrin receptor level, P\u00a0=\u00a00.132; higher growth differentiation factor 15 concentration, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Finally, MDS-RS patients carrying SF3B1 mutations had a better overall survival (median 38 vs. 18 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) compared to those without mutations. By multivariable analysis, the prognostic significance of the SF3B1 mutation was primarily accounted for by IPSS risk categorization.MDS-RS patients carrying SF3B1 mutations harbored a more severe iron overload and corresponding over-erythropoiesis. The better overall survival of SF3B1-mutated MDS-RS patients may be mainly due to the clustering of patients with lower risk disease in this group.",

Cytoreductive therapy is used to control organ dysfunction in aggressive systemic mastocytosis and is sometimes needed for control of severe refractory symptoms in patients with indolent disease. However, current standard cytoreductive agents are limited by their suboptimal degree and duration of response and associated significant toxicities, highlighting the need for novel treatments for systemic mastocytosis. Recent studies have identified CD30 as a therapeutic target in systemic mastocytosis, as CD30 is expressed on a majority of neoplastic mast cells. In this case series, the clinical outcomes of 4 patients with aggressive or indolent systemic mastocytosis treated with the anti-CD30 antibody\u2010drug conjugate brentuximab vedotin are reported. Two patients showed evidence of a response to treatment with a reduction in disease burden, 1 of which has demonstrated a durable response with ongoing benefit for more than 3 years. Treatment with brentuximab vedotin was well-tolerated with side effects that were effectively managed by dose modifications. The results presented suggest that brentuximab vedotin is active in systemic mastocytosis and can induce durable responses with a manageable toxicity profile.",

Homoharringtonine (HHT), an alkaloid from Chinese natural plants and Cephalotaxus, has demonstrated potential for leukemia treatment. Our studies have suggested that the combination of DAC and HHT has synergistic effects for inhibiting the viability of SKM-1 and Kg-1a cells. This combination leads to enhanced inhibition of colony formation and apoptosis induction compared with DAC alone in SKM-1 but not Kg-1a cells. Only high-dose DAC and HHT significantly up-regulate caspase-3 and caspase-9 and inhibit BCL-XL in the SKM-1 cell line. The combined effects of DAC plus HHT on apoptosis may not only depend on regulation of the apoptosis-related genes we examined but others as well. HHT had no demethylation effects, and HHT in combination with DAC had no enhanced effects on hypomethylation and DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B mRNA expression in SKM-1 cells. Overall, these results suggest that DAC used in combination with HHT may have clinical potential for MDS treatment.",

At registration, median age was lower in the ANA (55.5 years, range 18\u201389) and ANA + other CRT (59.0 years, range 22\u201388) groups vs the other CRT group (70.0 years, range 17\u201395).The arterial thrombotic event rate was similar in ANA (1.63) and other CRT (1.62) groups, whereas venous thrombotic event rates differed (0.35 vs 0.57). The major hemorrhagic event rate was highest in the ANA group, especially in patients also treated with anti-aggregatory therapy (1.24). 105 patients transformed to myelofibrosis (MF) and 62 to acute leukemia (AL). Transformation to MF rates were similar in the ANA (1.31) and ANA + other CRT (1.27) groups, but lower in the other CRT (0.32) group. Rate of transformation to AL was 0.17, 0.46, and 0.33, respectively. In patients who had only ever received either ANA or HC, rate of transformation to MF was higher in the ANA vs HC group (0.78 vs 0.17) whereas transformation to AL was higher in the HC vs ANA group (0.22 vs 0). All patients who ever received ANA and transformed to AL had also received prior HC.PDEs of greatest interest are displayed in Table 1. Non-hematological malignancy was the most frequent PDE in the other CRT group. 57.4% of deaths were attributed to a PDE; transformation (event rate, 1.9), most frequently to AL (1.3), and non-hematological malignancies (1.6) were the most frequent causes of PDE-related death. No unexpected side effects were noted.There were 54 pregnancies, of which 41 were successful (76%).The proportion of patients with a white blood cell (WBC) count >15 \u00d7 109/L at any time was higher in patients who died (12.5%) vs alive patients (6.1%) and in patients who had transformed (15.7%) vs those who did not transform (5.7%).Patients receiving ANA were younger than those receiving other CRT. Thrombotic event rates were low; arterial events were similar between ANA and other CRT groups, and venous events were lower in the ANA vs other CRT group. Hemorrhage was most frequent in the ANA + anti-aggregatory therapy group, whereas non-hematological malignancy was most frequent in the other CRT group. Transformation to MF was more frequent in the ANA group, whereas transformation to AL was more frequent in the HC group. The incidence of death and transformation was higher in patients with a WBC count >15 \u00d7 109/L.",

However, CP-CML patients resistant to initial TKIs face a poorer prognosis and significantly higher CML-related mortality. We conducted a systematic literature review to evaluate the specific causes of deaths (diseases progression versus drug-related) in CP-CML patients receiving second- or third-line therapy. We identified eight studies based on our criteria that reported causes of death. Overall, 5% of second-line and 10% of third-line patients died during the study follow-up period. For second-line, (7 studies, n\u00a0=\u00a01926), mortality was attributed to disease progression for 41% of deaths, 2% to treatment-related causes, 3% were treatment-unrelated, and 50% were unspecified adverse events (AEs), not likely related to study drug. In third-line, (2 studies, n\u00a0=\u00a0144), 71% deaths were attributed to disease progression, 7% treatment-related AEs, 14% treatment-unrelated and 7% unspecified AEs. Annual death rates for second- and third-line therapy were significantly higher than for general population in similar age group. Our findings suggest death attributed to disease progression is approximately 10 times that due to treatment-related AEs in patients with CP-CML receiving second- or third-line therapy. Therefore, the potential benefits of effective treatment for these patients with the currently available TKIs outweigh the risks of treatment-induced AEs.",

Challenging this notion are recent data suggesting CLL incidence may be increased by radiation exposure from the atomic bombs (after many decades), uranium mining and nuclear power facility accidents. To assess the effects of therapeutic ionizing radiation for the treatment of solid neoplasms we studied CLL risks in data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. Specifically, we compared the risks of developing CLL in persons with a 1st non-hematologic cancer treated with or without ionizing radiation. We controlled for early detection effects on CLL risk induced by surveillance after 1st cancer diagnoses by forming all-time cumulative CLL relative risks (RR). We estimate such CLL RR to be 1.20 (95% confidence interval, 1.17, 1.23) for persons whose 1st cancer was not treated with ionizing radiation and 1.00 (0.96, 1.05) for persons whose 1st cancer was treated with ionizing radiations. These results imply that diagnosis of a solid neoplasm is associated with an increased risk of developing CLL only in persons whose 1st cancer was not treated with radiation therapy.",

It is noted that clonal T-cell large granular lymphocyte (T-LGL) proliferation associated with MDS is not uncommon. However, clinicopathological features, and prognostic and predictive value of presence of T-LGL proliferation in MDS patients is not very clear. This study compared 35 MDS patients with T-LGL proliferation with 36 MDS patients without T-LGL proliferation and summarized clinicopathologic features, including peripheral blood LGL cell counts, immunophenotype, T cell receptor gene rearrangement, bone marrow hematopoietic status, and adjuvant immunosuppressive therapy. The peripheral blood CD3+/CD57+ cell counts were significantly different (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) between the two groups. Notably, on examination of the bone marrow, MDS patients with T-LGL proliferation showed more frequent hypocellularity and/or lineage hypoplasia, particularly erythroid hypoplasia. On survival analysis, no overall difference was noted between MDS patients with T-LGL proliferation and those without T-LGL proliferation, and between the patients who received therapy for LGL and those who did not receive adjuvant therapy for LGL in the same risk group. In conclusion, T-LGL proliferation present in MDS patients can be associated with bone marrow hypocellularity and lineage hypoplasia. Although immunosuppressive therapy to eliminate T-LGL cells is potentially beneficial to the MDS patients with associated T-LGL proliferation, there is no overall survival benefit to the patients who received such treatment.",

MDSCs were studied in two cohorts: the first cohort was 55 patients including 16 primary myelofibrosis (PMF), 7 post-polycythemia vera (PV)-MF, 2 post-essential thrombocythemia (ET)-MF, 11 ET, 17 PV, 2 undefined MPN disorder, and 23 normal controls; the second cohort included 38 patients: 17 ET, 7 PMF, 3 ET-MF, 2 PV-MF, 9 PV patients, and 20 normal volunteers. The second cohort was studied using freshly collected specimens and a comparable age group as controls. CD11b+, CD14\u2212, and CD33+ cells were defined as MDSCs in both cohorts by flow cytometry. Since there are no differences in MDSC levels among different MPN categories, they were grouped as MPNs. The results showed that MDSCs were significantly elevated in MPNs compared with controls in both cohorts. We also performed RT-PCR and found that MPN patients have significantly elevated arginase-1 mRNA compared with controls, and sorted MDSCs were found to have suppressor T cell activity in MPNs, substantiating the hypothesis that levels of MDSCs are, in fact, deranged in MPNs. MDSC levels were not correlated with JAK2 status, white blood cells, Hb levels, platelet counts, splenomegaly, or the degree of bone marrow fibrosis (in MF).

Nevertheless, it is controversial whether these cells harbor clonal cytogenetic aberrations. To probe more deeply into this issue, in the present study we used conventional G-banding and FISH analysis to assess the clonal chromosomal abnormalities of hematopoietic cells (HCs) and cultured MSCs, from 29 MDS patients and 25 healthy individuals, at early, intermediate and late passage. Variable clonal cytogenetic aberrations were detected in HCs from 31% and in MSCs from 34% of MDS patients. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities in MSCs were detected even in patients without aberrations in HCs. They were mostly numerical and always differed from those in HCs from the same individual. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities did not seem to confer a proliferative and/or survival advantage to MSCs. HCs from normal donors harbored no cytogenetic abnormalities, whereas trisomy of chromosome 5 was detected in MSCs from 16% of healthy individuals, in line with other studies. Our results suggest that MDS-derived BM-MSCs are genetically unstable. The significance of this observation in the biology of MSCs and MDS pathogenesis is still unknown and warrants further evaluation.",

It is difficult to identify all the DCs in the karyotypes of patients because of the limitations of metaphase cytogenetic methods. The aim of this study was to revise the karyotypes of 20 AML patients in whom DCs were found with conventional G-banding or multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) with (multi)centromeric probes and to characterize the DCs at the molecular cytogenetic level. FISH analyses confirmed 23 of the 29 expected DCs in 18 of 20 patients and identified 13 others that had not been detected cytogenetically. Fourteen DCs were altered by other chromosomal changes. In conclusion, karyotypes with DCs are usually very complex, and we have shown that they often contain more than one DC, which can be missed with conventional or mFISH methods. Our study indicates an association between number of DCs in karyotype and very short survival of patients.",

Copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity (CN-LOH, i.e., both copies of a chromosomal pair or their parts originate from one parent) might contribute to increased genomic instability in the bone-marrow cells of patients with MDS. The pathological potential of CN-LOH, which arises as a clonal aberration in a proportion of somatic cells, consists of tumor suppressor gene and oncogene homozygous mutations. The aim of our study was to evaluate the frequency of CN-LOH at 17p in bone-marrow cells of newly diagnosed MDS patients with complex chromosomal aberrations and to assess its correlation with mutations in the TP53 gene (17p13.1). CN-LOH was detected in 40 chromosomal regions in 21 (29%) of 72 patients analyzed. The changes in 27 of the 40 regions identified were sporadic. The most common finding was CN-LOH of the short arm of chromosome 17, which was detected in 13 (18%) of 72 patients. A mutational analysis confirmed the homozygous mutation of TP53 in all CN-LOH 17p patients, among which two frameshift mutations are not registered in the International Agency for Research on Cancer TP53 Database. CN-LOH 17p correlated with aggressive disease (median overall survival 4 months) and was strongly associated with a complex karyotype in the cohort studied, which might cause rapid disease progression in high-risk MDS. No other CN-LOH region previously recorded in MDS or AML patients (1p, 4q, 7q, 11q, 13q, 19q, 21q) was detected in our cohort of patients with complex karyotype examined at the diagnosis of MDS. The LOH region appeared to be balanced (i.e., with no DNA copy number change) when examined with conventional and molecular cytogenetic methods. Therefore, a microarray that detects single-nucleotide polymorphisms is an ideal method with which to identify and further characterize CN-LOH. Our data should specify the prognosis and should lead to the identification of potential targets for therapeutic interventions.",

However, infectious complications are common during LITR treatment and might hamper the beneficial effect of these drugs. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the incidence of and predisposing risk factors for infections during LITR treatment of AML, as well as the value of antibiotic prophylaxis within this setting. Therefore, we retrospectively analyzed 40 AML patients, treated with 215 cycles of LITR and analyzed putative risk factors by multivariate logistic regression. Infections occurred in 53/215 (25%) of LITR cycles, resulting in death in six patients. Of the parameters assessed at the start of each LITR cycle, transfusion dependence (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and increased LDH (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027) independently predicted the occurrence of infection. Most importantly, however, antibiotic prophylaxis was independently associated with a decreased rate of infectious complications (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030). It was regularly performed in neutropenic patients and even managed to eliminate low neutrophil counts as risk factor in multivariate models. These data argue for the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis during LITR therapy of AML and suggest its further evaluation within a prospective clinical trial.",

The expression of SIAH2 mRNA was also examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in these cells. Lentivirus-packed shRNA targeting on SIAH2 (Lv-shSIAH2) was used to knock down SIAH2 expression in Jurkat cells. Cell proliferation, apoptosis, invasion and protein levels were then determined by CCK-8 assay, annexin V-PI assay, transwell and Western blotting, respectively.The mRNA expression of SIAH2 in BMMNCs from primary T-ALL patients was significantly higher than cells from ITP patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0312); There were significant positive associations between SIAH2 expression and the extramedullary infiltration (EMI) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0003), especially with the mediastinal lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0168) and the pleural effusion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.014). However, SIAH2 expression in T-ALL BMMNCs was not correlated with age, gender, white cell count or the clinical risk classification.

Moreover, the organ invasion of PEL cells was suppressed in non-NOD background mice. Thus, the NOD genetic background is considered to contribute to more lymphomatous effusion and the infiltration of PEL cells than a non-NOD background.

Furthermore, U18666A, an inhibitor of NPC1 function, was used to block cholesterol trafficking to imitate the NPC1 defect in SUP-B15/S cells, leading to higher NPC1 expression, stronger filipin fluorescence, lower intracellular IM concentrations and greater resistance against IM. Samples from non-mutated relapsed Ph+ ALL patients also showed higher NPC1 expression compared with IM-sensitive patients. Our experiment may reveal a new mechanism of IM resistance in Ph+ ALL.",

To assess p53 expression, immunohistochemical analyses of bone marrow clot sections were performed. Overall survival (OS) was significantly lower in p53-positive patients compared with p53-negetive patients (59% vs. 85% at 12 months; P\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

     "abstract": "A deregulated CRLF2 (d-CRLF2) expression was described in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia without recurrent fusion genes (B-NEG ALL). While the role of d-CRLF2 in children has been extensively described, little is known about its role and impact in adult ALL.Expression levels of CRLF2 were evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR in 102 newly-diagnosed adult B-NEG ALL and correlated with the clinico-biological characteristics and outcome. Incidence and clinical impact of the P2RY8/CRLF2 transcript was also assessed.High CRLF2 levels, as continuous variable, were significantly associated with hyperleucocytosis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) and thrombocytopenia (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005); when a cut-point at \u0394Ct\u00a0\u2264\u00a08 was applied, 35 cases (34.3%), mostly males (80%), proved positive for CRLF2 expression. High CRLF2 levels, as continuous or categorical variable, were associated with a worse disease-free (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017 and 0.0038). Furthermore, when CRLF2 was analyzed as a categorical variable, a high statistical association was found with IKZF1 deletion and mutations in the JAK/STAT pathway (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, respectively). Finally, the P2RY8/CRLF2 transcript, identified in 8/102 patients (7.8%), was associated with a poor outcome.In adult B-NEG ALL, high CRLF2 expression is associated with distinct clinico-biological features and an unfavourable prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analysis; similarly, P2RY8/CRLF2 positivity correlates with a poor outcome. The quantification of CRLF2 is an important prognostic marker in adult B-lineage ALL without known genetic lesions.",

The miRNA-149* level was determined in multiple cell lines and bone marrow cells derived from patients with T-ALL, B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), and healthy donors.

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been increasingly used as a curative treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, relapse rates after HSCT in complete remission (CR) are reported between 30% and 70%. In addition, numerous studies suggested that secondary viral infection from a variety of viruses including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), adenovirus (Adv), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) are among the most common causes of death post-HSCT. Currently, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-based T cells have been developed to treat AML in clinical studies, while virus-specific cytotoxic T cells (VST) have been proven to be able to effectively prevent or treat viral infection after HSCT. Thus it would be desirable to develop T cells with the ability of simultaneously targeting AML relapse and viral infection. In this article, we now describe the generation of VST cells that are engineered to express CAR for a specific AML cell-surface antigen CD123 (CD123-CAR-VST). Using Dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with EBV, Adv, and CMV peptides as sources of viral antigens, we generated VST from A2 donor peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMC). VST were then transduced with retroviral vector encoding CD123-CAR to generate CD123-CAR-VST. We demonstrated that CD123-CAR-VST recognized EBV, Adv, and CMV epitopes and had HLA-restricted virus-specific cytotoxic effector function against EBV target. In addition, CD123-CAR-VST retained the specificity against CD123-positive AML cell lines such as MOLM13 and THP-1 in vitro. Thus our results suggested that CD123-CAR-VST might be a valuable candidate to simultaneously prevent or treat relapse and viral infection in AML HSCT recipients.",

     "abstract": "Bortezomib, a clinical drug for multiple myeloma (MM) and mantle cell lymphoma, exhibits complex mechanisms of action, which vary depending on the cancer type and the critical genetic alterations of each cancer. Here we investigated the signaling mechanisms of bortezomib in mouse B lymphoma and human MM cells deficient in a new tumor suppressor gene, TRAF3. We found that bortezomib consistently induced up-regulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p21(WAF1) and the pro-apoptotic protein Noxa as well as cleavage of the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1. Interestingly, bortezomib induced the activation of NF-\u03baB1 and the accumulation of the oncoprotein c-Myc, but inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that oridonin (an inhibitor of NF-\u03baB1 and NF-\u03baB2) or AD 198 (a drug targeting c-Myc) drastically potentiated the anti-cancer effects of bortezomib in TRAF3-deficient malignant B cells. Taken together, our findings increase the understanding of the mechanisms of action of bortezomib, which would aid the design of novel bortezomib-based combination therapies. Our results also provide a rationale for clinical evaluation of the combinations of bortezomib and oridonin (or other inhibitors of NF-\u03baB1/2) or AD 198 (or other drugs targeting c-Myc) in the treatment of lymphoma and MM, especially in patients containing TRAF3 deletions or relevant mutations.",

Furthermore, both proteins can efficiently stabilize the mRNA of the cell cycle inhibitor p21CIP1. Since acute myeloid leukemia (AML) differentiation requires cell cycle arrest and RBM38 as well as DND1 have antiproliferative functions, we hypothesized that decreased RBM38 and DND1 expression may contribute to the differentiation block seen in this disease. We first quantified RBM38 and DND1 mRNA expression in clinical AML patient samples and CD34+ progenitor cells and mature granulocytes from healthy donors. We found significantly lower RBM38 and DND1 mRNA levels in AML blasts and CD34+ progenitor cells as compared to mature neutrophils from healthy donors. Furthermore, the lowest expression of both RBM38 and DND1 mRNA correlated with t(8;21). In addition, neutrophil differentiation of CD34+ cells in vitro with G-CSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) resulted in a significant increase of RBM38 and DND1 mRNA levels. Similarly, neutrophil differentiation of NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells was associated with a significant induction of RBM38 and DND1 expression. To address the function of RBM38 and DND1 in neutrophil differentiation, we generated two independent NB4RBM38 as well as DND1 knockdown cell lines. Inhibition of both RBM38 and DND1 mRNA significantly attenuated NB4 differentiation and resulted in decreased p21CIP1 mRNA expression. Our results clearly indicate that expression of the RNA binding proteins RBM38 and DND1 is repressed in primary AML patients, that neutrophil differentiation is dependent on increased expression of both proteins, and that these proteins have a critical role in regulating p21CIP1 expression during APL differentiation.",

Also, MRD assessments yielded relevant information on favourable and adverse cytogenetics, since patients with favourable cytogenetics and high MRD levels have poor prognosis and patients with adverse cytogenetics but undetectable MRD overcomes the adverse prognosis. Interestingly, in patients with intermediate or high MRD levels, intensification with transplant improved the outcome as compared with chemotherapy, while the type of intensification therapy did not influenced the outcome of patients with low MRD levels.

To determine the role of stem cell transplantation (SCT), we performed a retrospective review of adult patients with AML who underwent SCT at our center between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2011. Of the 200 patients transplanted, 79 patients (40%) had normal cytogenetics; of these, 17 (22%) had the FLT3-ITD mutation, 35 were WT (44%), and 27 (34%) did not have FLT3 testing performed. Clinical characteristics were similar in each group. At four years, overall survival (OS) between FLT3 positive and WT groups was similar: 0.54 (95% CI 0.29\u20130.75) versus 0.73 (95% CI 0.53\u20130.99), p\u00a0=\u00a00.18.

For inhibition studies a recently introduced antagonistic antibody to the TSLPR\u03b1-subunit was used.TSLPR surface expression was observed in leukemic lymphoblasts from two out of ten patients with BCP-ALL. Upon TSLP stimulation, the cells with the highest TSLPR expression level showed enhanced proliferation and JAK/STAT-mediated gene regulation in a dose-dependent manner. By employment of an inhibitory antibody to the TSLPR, both TSLP-triggered cell proliferation and STAT transcription factor activation were specifically inhibited.These results suggest that blockade of the TSLPR might be a therapeutic option for a subset of BCP-ALL patients.",

In view of the failure of IL-6 monoclonal antibody therapy to demonstrate substantial clinical responses in early clinical trials, more effective methods are needed in order to disrupt the favourable microenvironment provided by the bone marrow stroma. In this study, we evaluated the short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated silencing of IL-6 in MSC and the efficacy of these genetically modified MSC, with IL-6 suppression, on inhibition of U266 multiple myeloma cell growth. IL-6 mRNA and protein were significantly suppressed by 72\u00a0h post IL-6 siRNA transfection without affecting the biological properties of MSC. Here we show significant inhibition of cell growth and IL-6 production in U266 cells co-cultured with MSC transfected with IL-6 siRNA when compared to U266 cells co-cultured with control MSC. We also show that the tumour volume and mitotic index of tumours in nude mice co-injected with U266 and MSC transfected with IL-6 siRNA were significantly reduced compared to tumours of mice co-injected with control MSC.

However, studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) have been impeded in part by the lack of continuous human cell lines. CLL cells have a high spontaneous apoptosis rate in vitro and exhibit minimal proliferation in xenograft models. Therefore, there is a need for development of primary CLL cell lines and we describe the isolation of such a line from the bone marrow of a CLL patient (17p deletion and TP53 mutation) which has been in long term culture for more than 12 months with continuous proliferation. The CLL cell line (termed MDA-BM5) which was generated in vitro with continuous co-culture on autologous stromal cells is CD19+CD5+ and shows an identical pattern of somatic hypermutation as determined in the patient\u2019s bone marrow (BM), confirming the origin of the cells from the original CLL clone. MDA-BM5 cells were readily transplantable in NOD/SCID gamma null mice (NSG) with disease developing in the BM, liver and spleen. BM cells from quaternary serial transplantation in NSG mice demonstrated the presence of CD19+CD5+ cells with Ig restricted to lambda which is consistent with the original patient cells.

Loss of IRF8 in mice leads to a myeloproliferative disorder, indicating a tumor-suppressive role of IRF8. The Wilms tumor gene 1 (WT1) protein represses the IRF8-promoter. The zinc finger protein ZNF224 can act as a transcriptional co-factor of WT1 and potentiate the cytotoxic response to the cytostatic drug cytarabine. We hypothesized that cytarabine upregulates IRF8 and that transcriptional control of IRF8 involves WT1 and ZNF224. Treatment of leukemic K562 cells with cytarabine upregulated IRF8 protein and mRNA, which was correlated to increased expression of ZNF224. Knock down of ZNF224 with shRNA suppressed both basal and cytarabine-induced IRF8 expression. While ZNF224 alone did not affect IRF8 promoter activity, ZNF224 partially reversed the suppressive effect of WT1 on the IRF8 promoter, as judged by luciferase reporter experiments. Coprecipitation revealed nuclear binding of WT1 and ZNF224, and by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments it was demonstrated that WT1 recruits ZNF224 to the IRF8 promoter. We conclude that cytarabine-induced upregulation of the IRF8 in leukemic cells involves increased levels of ZNF224, which can counteract the repressive activity of WT1 on the IRF8-promoter.",

There were no clinical differences, including JAK2V617F allele burden, between PV patients harboring the various genetic mutations. However, CALR mutation-positive ET patients had a significantly lower WBC count, Hb value, Ht value, and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase score (NAP), and significantly more platelets, relative to JAK2V617F-positive ET patients and ET patients with no mutations. Compared to normal controls, the frequency of the JAK246/1 haplotype was significantly higher among patients with JAK2V617F, JAK2Ex12del, or MPL mutations, whereas no significant difference was found among CALR mutation-positive patients.

The primary endpoint of this study was an overall response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints were as follows: time to progression (TTP), overall survival (OS) and the safety of drug use. Data were collected in 19 centres of the Polish Multiple Myeloma Study Group.The study group consisted of 306 subjects: 153 females and 153 males. In 115 patients (38.8%, group A), a resistant myeloma was diagnosed; in 135 (44.1%, group B) a relapse, and in 56 (18.3%, group C) a stable disease were stated.

We previously reported that FLT3-ITD confers resistance to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), a key cytotoxic agent in AML treatments. In order to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the Ara-C resistance induced by FLT3-ITD, we performed a microarray gene expression analysis of the human leukemic cell line K562 transduced with FLT3-ITD (K562/FLT3-ITD) and identified RUNX3 as a downstream target of FLT3-ITD. The transcriptional induction of the RUNX3 expression by FLT3-ITD was noted on a Luciferase assay. The knockdown of the RUNX3 expression in the K562/FLT3-ITD cells increased the sensitivity to Ara-C, and the exogenous expression of RUNX3 per se resulted in the enhancement of Ara-C resistance in the K562 cells. A relationship between the FLT3-ITD-induced RUNX3 expression and Ara-C resistance was also observed in AML cells with an endogenous FLT3-ITD expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that RUNX3 is a prerequisite for Ara-C resistance via FLT3-ITD signaling.",

Our current studies have shown that, the antidiabetic drug metformin also exerts anti-leukemic effect by activating p-AMPK and synergistically sensitizes FLT3 mutated AML to sorafenib. Both agents suppress cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and induce apoptosis via cell cycle arrest, but does not obviously modulate autophagy marker, light chain 3 (LC3). Mechanistically, in the presence of metformin, the anticancer potential of sorafenib, accompanying with increased LC3 levels, is found to be synergistically enhanced with the remarkably reduced protein expression of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP1 pathway, while not appreciably altering cell cycle. Overall, these results show metformin in aid of sorafenib may represent a promising and attractive strategy for the treatment of FLT3-ITD mutated AML.",

Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) potently inhibits lymphopoiesis by targeting stromal cells that comprise the lymphoid niche in the bone marrow. To determine whether lymphoid niche disruption by G-CSF sensitizes ALL cells to chemotherapy, we conducted a pilot study of G-CSF in combination with chemotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory ALL. Thirteen patients were treated on study; three patients achieved a complete remission (CR/CRi) for an overall response rate of 23%. In the healthy volunteers, G-CSF treatment disrupted the lymphoid niche, as evidenced by reduced expression of CXCL12, interleukin-7, and osteocalcin. However, in most patients with relapsed/refractory ALL expression of these genes was markedly suppressed at baseline. Thus, although G-CSF treatment was associated with ALL cell mobilization into the blood, and increased apoptosis of bone marrow resident ALL cells, alterations in the bone marrow microenvironment were modest and highly variable. These data suggest that disruption of lymphoid niches by G-CSF to sensitize ALL cells to chemotherapy may be best accomplished in the consolidation where the bone marrow microenvironment is more likely to be normal.",

There is, however relatively little understanding of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma molecular pathogenesis. Thus, in this study we applied RNA sequencing to systematically screen for altered gene expression in human NK/T-cell lymphoma cell lines YTS and SNK-6 versus normal NK cells. We found that ATP-binding cassette sub-family C Member 4 (ABCC4) levels were significantly upregulated both in human NK/T-cell lymphoma YTS and SNK-6 cells, as compared with normal NK cells. These expression levels were further confirmed by real-time PCR. Protein levels of ABCC4 were also significantly higher in YTS and SNK-6 cells as compared with normal NK cells. Clinically relevant, ABCC4 expression levels were significantly higher in human NK/T-cell lymphoma tissues as compared with control nasal mucosa tissues, confirmed by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, we explored the biological function of such ABCC4 upregulation. Overexpression of ABCC4 by lentivirus transfection induced chemotherapy resistance to epirubicin (EPI) and cisplatin (DDP) in YTS cells. In contrast, knockdown of ABCC4 expression by shRNA contributed to chemotherapy sensitivity by both EPI and DDP. Furthermore, overexpression of ABCC4 inhibited, while downregulation of ABCC4 increased, YTS cell apoptosis following treatment by EPI or DDP. Therefore, the present study identified ABCC4 to be overexpressed in human NK/T-cell lymphoma cells, to regulate chemotherapy sensitivity to EPI and DDP, and possibly to be a functional therapeutic target. These findings may provide a basic rationale for new approaches in the effort to develop anti-tumor therapeutics for NK/T-cell lymphoma.",

     "abstract": "The aim of the study was to evaluate serum levels of FLT3-ligand (FLT3-L), a soluble molecule in bone marrow (BM), participating actively in hematopoiesis, in relation with angiogenic factors in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. We measured, in 70 patients with active MM and in 38 of them who responded to conventional therapy, serum levels of FLT3-L, along with known angiogenic factors, such as VEGF, endoglin, TNF-alpha and HGF (with ELISA) and BM microvascular density (MVD), estimating the immunohistochemical expression of CD31. All pre-treatment values were higher in active MM patients compared to controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for all cases), in parallel with both International Staging System and Durie\u2013Salmon stages (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for all cases). Moreover, levels of FLT3-L correlated positively with all soluble angiogenic factors, as well with MVD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for all cases). Post-treatment values of FLT3-L decreased significantly in responders to therapy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The underlying relation of MM angiogenesis with FLT3-L may result from the fact that BM microvasculature is a major source of FLT3-L, both in BM niche and probably in peripheral blood. Our results suggest that serum levels of FLT3-L may be used as angiogenic marker in MM patients.",

     "abstract": "Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an aggressive malignancy of peripheral T cells infected with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). The prognosis of patients with aggressive ATL remains poor because ATL cells acquire resistance to conventional cytotoxic agents. Therefore, development of novel agents is urgently needed. We examined the effects of YM155, sepantronium bromide, on cell proliferation and survival of ATL or HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, S1T, MT-1, and MT-2. We found that YM155 suppressed cell proliferation in these cells and induced cell death in S1T and MT-1 cells. Both real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses showed suppression of survivin expression in S1T, MT-1, and MT-2 cells. In addition, we observed the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in YM155-treated S1T and MT-1 cells, indicating that YM155 induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in these cells. To clarify the mechanism of drug tolerance of MT-2 cells in terms of YM155-induced cell death, we examined intracellular signaling status in these cells. We found that STAT3, STAT5, and AKT were constitutively phosphorylated in MT-2 cells but not in S1T and MT-1 cells. Treatment with YM155 combined with the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 significantly suppressed cell proliferation compared to that with either YM155 or S3I-201 in MT-2 cells, indicating that STAT3 may play a role in tolerance of MT-2 cells to YM155 and that STAT3 may therefore be a therapeutic target for YM155-resistant ATL cells. These results suggest that YM155 presents potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects via suppression of survivin in ATL cells in which STAT3 is not constitutively phosphorylated. YM155 merits further investigation as a potential chemotherapeutic agent for ATL.",

MD Anderson prognostic score (MDAPS) has been the most useful for CMML risk assessment. Due to recent emergence of CMML-specific prognostic scoring system (CPSS) and Mayo prognostic model, we compared the three scores.One hundred forty-six CMML patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2014 were retrospectively analyzed. Univariate analysis was performed to assess prognostic impact on overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) of the variables composing the scores and all items showed prognostic value on OS with the exception of the presence of circulating immature myeloid cells. Regarding LFS, only CPSS variables, bone marrow blast \u226510% and an absolute monocyte count >10\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L had an impact. When the scores were applied, all showed an impact on OS and retained their significance in multivariate analysis. By using ROC curves and C-index, CPSS showed a slightly better predictive value for mortality and leukemia transformation. Variables composing the three indexes were compared in multivariate analysis and only CPSS parameters and platelets\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/L retained their significance. Based on these findings, by adding platelet count to CPSS, a new score was implemented (CPSS-P) showing the best risk prediction capability in our series.

To guide physicians, several prognostic factors have been identified and risk scores developed. Recently, the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine has become available for use in MDS and AML patients with up to 30% bone marrow blasts. However, limited data are available on the outcome of older unfit AML patients, regardless of their bone marrow blast count. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 90 newly diagnosed older unfit AML patients in 9 Institutions from the Apulia Region (REP). Responder patients (evaluation performed after 4 cycles of treatment even in cases of primary failure) showed a better overall survival than non responders (23 vs 6 months, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). ECOG PS\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 seems to be correlated with OS in multivariate analysis, while neither primary treatment failure (documented after 2 cycles) nor bone marrow blast count were correlated with a worse overall survival either at univariate (22 vs 29 months, p\u00a0=\u00a0.ns; 16 vs 19 months, p\u00a0=\u00a0.ns) or multivariate analysis.

We compared the detection of TP53 mutations by FASAY and NGS in 91 patients with AML or MDS. By FASAY, 91% of assays were evaluable and 47 patients (57%) had a functional and 36 (43%) a non-functional p53 protein. FASAY could not conclude in 8 cases (9%), mainly because of poor RNA quality. No TP53 mutation was found using NGS in 50 cases (55%), and at least one mutation was detected in 41 cases (45%). The p53 status was concordant between FASAY and NGS in 95% (79/83) of cases. The four discordances included mutations detected by FASAY only in two cases, and by NGS only in two cases. Mutations not detected by NGS consisted of insertions in intronic regions, which were not analyzed by this assay. Mutations not detected by FASAY were mutations for which the percentage of mutated allele was less than 10%, including one mutation reported as non-deleterious in the IARC database. Overall, our data suggest that FASAY is an effective and reliable method to detect TP53 mutations in AML and MDS, which allows the assessment of the protein functionality, contrary to a sequencing approach.",

Despite the well-documented pathogenic role of BCR precursor (pre-BCR) pathway in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), there is limited available data of therapies that aim to disrupt this pathway. To investigate the role of protein kinase C\u03b2 (PKC\u03b2), a crucial mediator of BCR and pre-BCR signaling, in B-ALL survival, we studied the activity of the PKC\u03b2 selective inhibitor enzastaurin (ENZ) in seven B-ALL cell lines. Treatment with ENZ resulted in a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition in all cell lines with a relatively higher efficacy in pro-B ALL with translocation t(4;11)(q21;q23). The mechanism of growth inhibition was by apoptotic induction and cell cycle arrest. A rapid reduction in phosphorylation of AKT and its downstream target glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) were observed at 30\u00a0min after treatment and remaining for 48\u00a0h. The reduction in GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation was associated with a paradoxical accumulation of \u03b2-catenin, which was due to a transient loss of \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation at ser33-37. In addition, accumulation of \u03b2-catenin was associated with downregulation of c-Myc, upregulatiuon of c-Jun, and a subsequent protective effect on the tumor suppressor p73.Data in this paper were presented in part at 2012 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting, abstract 1350.",

     "abstract": "B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in adults is a very challenging disease. Relapse following remission after induction chemotherapy remains the major barrier to patient survival. ADAM28 is overexpressed in several human tumors and is related to cell proliferation and lymph node metastasis. To date, no information has been available on the prognostic role of ADAM28 in B-ALL. Fifty consecutive patients with de novo B-ALL and 22 healthy donors were enrolled in this study and were followed for 2.8 years. Our data suggested that ADAM28 expression in B-ALL patients was significantly increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Patients experiencing disease relapse exhibited significantly increased ADAM28 expression, compared with those with favorable outcomes (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0094). Notably, ADAM28 overexpression was associated with lower probabilities of relapse-free survival (RFS) and event-free survival (EFS) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and was a significant prognostic factor (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In vitro, the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor, as well as arsenic trioxide (ATO), down-regulated ADAM28 expression. Our results were the first to indicate that ADAM28 overexpression in B-ALL patients is correlated with relapse. ADAM28 overexpression is potentially regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. These data demonstrate that ADAM28 might serve as a novel biomarker for evaluating relapse in B-ALL and as a potential therapeutic target in B-ALL patients.",

     "abstract": "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a malignant tumor common in children. Studies of genetic susceptibility to cancer using biallelic insertion/deletion (INDEL) type polymorphisms associated with cancer development pathways may help to clarify etymology of ALL. In this study, we investigate the role of eight functional INDEL polymorphisms and influence of genetic ancestry to B-cell ALL susceptibility in children of Brazilian Amazon population, which has a high degree of inter-ethnic admixture. Ancestry analysis was estimated using a panel of 48 autosomal ancestry informative markers. 130 B-cell ALL patients and 125 healthy controls were included in this study. The odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for confounders. The results indicated an association between the investigated INDEL polymorphisms in CASP8 (rs3834129), CYP19A1 (rs11575899) e XRCC1 (rs3213239) genes in the development of B-cell ALL. The carriers of Insertion/Insertion (Ins/Ins) genotype of the polymorphism in CASP8 gene presented reduced chances of developing B-cell ALL (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001; OR\u00a0=\u00a00.353; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.192\u20130.651). The Deletion/Deletion (Del/Del) genotype of the polymorphism in CYP19A1 gene was associated to a lower chance of developing B-cell ALL (P\u00a0=\u00a03.35\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126; OR\u00a0=\u00a00.121; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.050\u20130.295), while Del/Del genotype of the polymorphism in XRCC1 gene was associated to a higher chance of developing B-cell ALL (P\u00a0=\u00a02.01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22124; OR\u00a0=\u00a06.559; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a02.433\u201317.681).

     "abstract": "BCR-ABL positive (+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) accounts for \u223c30% of cases of ALL. We recently demonstrated that 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a dual energy (glycolysis inhibition) and ER-stress (N-linked-glycosylation inhibition) inducer, leads to cell death in ALL via ER-stress/UPR-mediated apoptosis. Among ALL subtypes, BCR-ABL+ ALL cells exhibited the highest sensitivity to 2-DG suggesting BCR-ABL expression may be linked to this increased vulnerability. To confirm the role of BCR-ABL, we constructed a NALM6/BCR-ABL stable cell line and found significant increase in 2-DG-induced apoptosis compared to control. We found that Mcl-1 was downregulated by agents inducing ER-stress and Mcl-1 levels correlated with ALL sensitivity. In addition, we showed that Mcl-1 expression is positively regulated by the MEK/ERK pathway, dependent on BCR-ABL, and further downregulated by combining ER-stressors with TKIs. We determined that energy/ER stressors led to translational repression of Mcl-1 via the AMPK/mTOR and UPR/PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathways. Taken together, our data indicate that BCR-ABL+ ALL exhibits heightened sensitivity to induction of energy and ER-stress through inhibition of the MEK/ERK pathway, and translational repression of Mcl-1 expression via AMPK/mTOR and UPR/PERK/eIF2\u03b1 pathways. This study supports further consideration of strategies combining energy/ER-stress inducers with BCR-ABL TKIs for future clinical translation in BCR-ABL+ ALL patients.",

It is a life threatening hematopoietic stem cells disorder, which is characterized by pancytopenia or complete loss of blood-forming cells. The aim of the present study is to screen for the mutations in telomerase complex genes, and to establish a molecular and hematological profile of Indian sub population.We have conducted a case control study of total 70 participants; 50 patients, who fulfilled the blood count and bone marrow criteria of the International agranulocytosis & AAA, and 20 healthy controls. These samples were selected from hematology clinics at Jaipur, India, during the period of two years (January 2012\u2013December 2013). We screened four telomere complex genes; TERT, DKC1, NOP10 and NHP2 of mutations at single base pair in sampled blood and bone marrows. We have predicated the consequences of mutations on protein structure using 3D multilevel modeling protein structure software Phyre2, PolyPhen2 and YASARA.The hematological and molecular basis of acquired aplastic anemia was investigated in 50 anemia patients and 20 healthy controls. AAA patients showed hematologic abnormalities (macrocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, & granulocytopenia) in peripheral blood and severe hypoplastic bone marrows. Screening of telomere complex genes TERT, DKC1, NOP10 and NHP2 in AAA patients and controls revealed; novel and reported mutations in TERT and DKC1, whereas, no pathogenic mutations were observed in NOP10 and NHP2 genes. In TERT gene, one non-synonymous mutation (Chr5: 1287,825 C\u00a0\u2192\u00a0T; Arg979Trp) was identified in exon 12 and two heterozygous non-synonymous mutations (Chr X: 153,994,542 T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0K; Val105Gly & Chr X: 153,994,591 T\u00a0\u2192\u00a0K; Ser121Arg) were found in exon 5 of DKC1 gene. To determine and visualize the possible effect of TERT and DKC1 mutations on protein structure YASARA with FoldX functionality has been used and many structural consequences were found that might destabilize the protein. Predicated structural consequences may destabilize the TERT and DKC1 proteins ultimately causing blood disorders..The present study indicates the mutation spectrum in the genes implicated in AAA, i.e. TERT, DKC1, NOP10 and NHP2 on small case-control group in an Indian sub population.",

In addition, although HCL patients respond well to the BRAFV600E inhibitor vemurafenib, relapses are being observed, suggesting the development of drug resistance in patients with this mutation. To investigate the biological role of BRAFV600E in B-cell leukemia, we generated a CLL-like B-cell line, OSUCLL, with doxycycline-inducible BRAFV600E expression. Microarray and real-time PCR analysis showed that ABCB1 mRNA is upregulated in these cells, and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression as well as function were confirmed by immunoblot and rhodamine exclusion assays. Additionally, pharmacological inhibition of BRAFV600E and MEK alleviated the BRAFV600E-induced ABCB1/P-gp expression. ABCB1 reporter assays and gel shift assays demonstrated that AP-1 activity is crucial in this mechanism. This study, uncovers a pathological role for BRAFV600E in B-cell leukemia, and provides further evidence that combination strategies with inhibitors of BRAFV600E and MEK can be used to delay disease progression and occurrence of resistance.",

Treatment of del (5q) MDS with the drug lenalidomide has significantly improved quality of life leading to transfusion independence and complete cytogenetic response rates (CCR) in the majority of patients. Telomeres are located at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes and are linked to replicative history/potential as well as genetic (in) stability of hematopoietic stem cells. Here, we analyzed telomere length (TL) dynamics before and under lenalidomide treatment in the peripheral blood and/or bone marrow of del (5q) patients enrolled in the LEMON-5 study (NCT01081431).Hematopoietic cells from del (5q) MDS patients were characterized by significantly shortened TL compared to age-matched healthy controls. Telomere loss was more accelerated in patients with longer disease duration (>2 years) and more pronounced cytopenias. Sequential analysis under lenalidomide treatment revealed that previously shortened TL in peripheral blood cells was significantly \u201celongated\u201d towards normal levels within the first six months suggesting a shift from clonal del (5q) cells towards normal hematopoiesis in lenalidomide treated MDS patients.Taken together our findings suggest that the development of the del (5q) clone is associated with accelerated telomere shortening at diagnosis. However, upon induction of CCR and reoccurrence of normal hematopoiesis, the lack of a persistent TL deficit argues against telomere-mediated genetic instability neither as a disease-promoting event of del (5q) MDS nor for lenalidomide mediated development of secondary primary malignancies of the hematopoietic system in responding patients.",

The BM stromal cells of MDS patients often harbor distinct chromosomal aberrations than the hematopoietic elements, suggesting different genetic origins.

We evaluated 140 AML patients without prior MDS who had complete blood count (CBC) data available 6\u201336 months prior to their diagnosis. Cytopenia, defined as clinically unexplained thrombocytopenia or macrocytic anemia, was present in 29/140 (21%) patients. Compared to non-cytopenic patients, AML patients with prior cytopenia were older and more often met morphologic or cytogenetic criteria for AML-MRC. Prior cytopenia was associated with shorter survival in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics (median OS 4.2 versus 24.1 months, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but not in patients with adverse-risk cytogenetics (median OS 4.4 versus 6.0 months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.57).

Aberrant hypomethylation of DNMT3A gene was found in 55.3% (84/152) of AML cases, but the status of DNMT3A hypomethylation was not correlated with the expression of four DNMT3A isoforms as well as DNMT3A mutation. There was no significant difference in the rates of complete remission (CR) between patients with and without DNMT3A hypomethylation. However, the patients with DNMT3A hypomethylation had shorter overall survival (OS) time than those without DNMT3A hypomethylation (7 months vs 11 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.034). Moreover, the patients with DNMT3A hypomethylation also showed significantly shorter OS than those without DNMT3A hypomethylation in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) (7 months vs 25 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.011). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent adverse impact of DNMT3A hypomethylation in CN-AML. Our data suggest that DNMT3A DMR2 hypomethylation is a negative prognostic hallmark in CN-AML.",

Inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPA) is an enzyme involved in 6-MP metabolic pathway that convert the inosine triphosphate (ITP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and prevents the accumulation of the toxic metabolite ITP. Our objective was to evaluate the ITPA 94C>A, IVS2+21A>C polymorphisms in patients with ALL treated with 6-MP and prediction of its clinical outcomes. Our study population consisted of 70 patients diagnosed with ALL in the Division of Hematology\u2013Oncology of Tehran Mofid Hospital. PCR was carried out to amplify exon 2, exon 3, intron 2, and intron 3 of ITPA gene then, all the amplified fragments were subjected to directional sequencing and then association between genotype and 6-MP toxicity was studied. In this study two exonic variants including 94C>A and 138G>A showed a prevalence of 8.5% and 36.4%, respectively. Two intronic variants, IVS2+21A>C and IVS3+101G>A were found in 13.5% and 7% of the samples, respectively. The rate of myelosuppression in the presence of mutant homozygote and heterozygous alleles (94C>A, 138G>A, IVS2+21A>C and IVS3+101G>A) was higher than that of wild type alleles during the use of 6-MP. Hepatotoxicity in patients with mutant homozygous and heterozygous 94C>A and IVS3+101G>A during the treatment 6-MP was higher than before treatment with 6-MP. Our results showed that patients with aberrant ITPase genotype (mutant homozygous or heterozygous), more likely to be myelosuppressed and show liver toxicity after treatment with 6-MP. Our results suggest that pre-therapeutic screening of patients for ITPA 94C>A, IVS2+21A>C and IVS3+101G>A can help in minimizing the adverse effects of 6-MP in ALL patients.",

Optimal therapy adherence has become of paramount importance to maximize the benefits in the long-term outcome. Several evidences have been reported that personal factors, such as social support, psychological and subjective perceptions about the drug used and the future, could influence adherence. We here report the results of a questionnaire specifically designed to evaluate factors influencing adherence and perceptions about the future, distributed to patients during regional Italian meetings. Overall, 1133 patients compiled the questionnaire: median age was 57 years. High rate of adherence was reported, but 42% of interviewed patients admitted that they had occasionally postponed a dose and 58% had discontinued therapy mainly for forgetfulness. The majority of patients discussed with personal physician about the importance of adherence and received sufficient information about illness and treatment, but would like to have discussed more about discomfort, anxiety and fear of the future. Summarizing personal drug compliance and estimating how many days a month, on average, the patients did not take the drug, the majority answered that it was less than 3 days (55%) and only a minority (4%) admitted that it was more than 7 days. Interviewed about discontinuation, 49% of patients answered that wouldn\u2019t interrupt because of fear of losing all the results achieved so far. This study suggests a higher level of satisfaction with more information received but the need of improving communication about possible future treatment free remission.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the secular trend in mortality for children with ALL living in Sergipe, a state in northeastern Brazil, and to investigate any association with variables that relate to socioeconomic status.This study evaluated ALL patients who were less than 20 years of age and who were treated at the Dr. Osvaldo Leite Oncology Center in the capital city, Aracaju. The sample comprised two cohorts of patients from the public health service: patients treated from 1980 to 2004 (cohort A) and from 2005 to 2014 (cohort B). The findings were compared to those of patients treated in the one private service for pediatric cancer treatment available in the region, from 2005 to 2014 (cohort C). Two categories of variables were considered in this study: biological and socioeconomic.We analyzed 412 patients who were divided into three cohorts (cohort A: 287 patients, cohort B: 106 patients and cohort C: 19 patients). The mortality rates for the three cohorts were significantly different: 57.5% in cohort A, 45.3% in cohort B and 26.3% in cohort C (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Mortality during induction in cohort B was 22.6%, while in cohort C no deaths occurred during this phase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.041). Patients living in rural areas had higher mortality rates (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036).The reduction in deaths from infection during induction seems to be the starting point for improving the chances for children and adolescents with ALL anywhere in the world.",

     "abstract": "Fenretinide, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide, (4-HPR), a synthetic retinoid, owes its cancer-toxic effects in part to the generation of ceramide, a potent tumor-suppressing sphingolipid. As such, 4-HPR has garnered considerable interest as a chemotherapeutic. Cancer cells, however, via various metabolic routes, inactivate ceramide, and this can limit 4-HPR efficacy. As relatively little is known regarding 4-HPR-induced ceramide management in acute myelogeneous leukemia (AML), we undertook the present study to evaluate the impact of 4-HPR on ceramide production, metabolism, and cytotoxicity. In KG-1, HL-60, and HL-60/VCR (multidrug resistant) human leukemia cells, 4-HPR induced 15-, 2-, and 20-fold increases in ceramide (measured using [3H]palmitic acid), respectively. By use of specific inhibitors we show that ceramide was produced by sphingomyelinase and de novo pathways in response to 4-HPR exposure. HL-60/VCR cells metabolized ceramide to glucosylceramide (GC). 4-HPR exposure (1.25\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM) reduced viability in all cell lines, with approximate IC50's ranging from 1 to 8.0\u00a0\u03bcM. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were generated in response to 4-HPR treatment, and the concomitant cytotoxicity was reversed by addition of vitamin E. 4-HPR was not cytotoxic nor did it elicit ceramide formation in K562, a chronic myeloid leukemia cell line; however, K562 cells were sensitive to a cell-deliverable form of ceramide, C6-ceramide. Treatment of Molt-3, an acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line, with 4-HPR revealed moderate ceramide production (5-fold over control), robust conversion of ceramide to GC and sphingomyelin, and resistance to 4-HPR and C6-ceramide. In conclusion, this work demonstrates diversity within and among leukemia in 4-HPR sensitivity and ceramide generation and subsequent metabolism. As such, knowledge of these metabolic pathways can provide guidance for enhancing ceramide-driven effects of 4-HPR in treatment of leukemia.",

While Jurkat and Raji cells (established from pediatric patients) displayed abrogated proliferative potential, HL-60 and K652 cells (originated from adults) exposed to Saq-NO treatment underwent caspase dependent apoptosis. In addition, similar sensitivity to Saq-NO was observed in mononuclear blood cells obtained from pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Western blot analysis indicated p70S6 kinase as a possible intracellular target of Saq-NO action.

However, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib mesylate are not effective in the patients with advanced-stage of CML. Hence, there is an urgent need for new approaches to overcome a cancer cell's resistance in CML long term therapy. Development of new drug carriers, is presently one of the most challenging tasks in experimental oncology.In this report we investigated whether the toxicity of newly synthetized doxorubicin transferrin conjugate (DOX-TRF) may be connected to the limitation of multidrug resistance in CML cells by the alternations of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. The studies were performed on human chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines sensitive (K562) and resistant (K562/DOX) to doxorubicin. Our research proves that DOX-TRF conjugate displays higher cytotoxicity toward both examined cell lines than the reference free drug (DOX) and induces more extensive pro-apoptotic changes. Moreover, by the of engagement of Wnt pathway agonist (LiCl) and antagonist (ICG 001) we demonstrate that DOX-TRF conjugate effectively reduces transcription of key genes involved in \u03b2-catenin signaling transduction trial (Wnt3a, DVL-1, FZD-3, LRP5, \u03b2-catenin, DKK2) and triggers morphology alternations of CML cells.",

Refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) is the most common subtype of pediatric MDS and has overlapping clinical features with viral infections and autoimmune disorders. Mutations in TET2 gene are found in about 20\u201325% of adult MDS and are associated with a decrease in 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) content. TET2 deregulation and its malignant potential were reported in adult but not in pediatric MDS. We evaluated the gene expression and the presence of mutations in TET2 gene in 19 patients with RCC. TET2 expression level was correlated with 5-hmC amount in DNA and possible regulatory epigenetic mechanisms. One out of 19 pediatric patients with RCC was a carrier of a TET2 mutation. TET2 expression and 5-hmC levels were decreased in patients when compared to a disease-free group. Lower expression was not associated to the presence of mutation or with the status of promoter methylation, but a significant correlation with microRNA-22 expression was found. These findings suggested that TET2 downregulation and low levels of 5-hmC are inversely related to miR-22 expression. The existence of a regulatory loop between microRNA-22 and TET2 may play a role in MDS pathogenesis.",

These results suggested that ATO-based therapy may ameliorate the unfavorable influence of previously known high-risk features; moreover, CD56 expression remains to be a potentially unfavorable prognostic factor in APL patients.",

The role of salvage therapy in the elderly is controversial and there is little data on efficacy. Outcomes for 94 relapsed or refractory AML patients who received salvage HAMA therapy were analyzed. Of the 94 patients 66 were \u226560, including 26 patients \u226570, and 28 were <60 years old. Early mortality (30-day) was 14% (4%\u00a0<\u00a060, 18%\u00a0\u2265\u00a060 years old). Overall, 27% of patients died during hospitalization or were discharged to hospice (11%\u00a0<\u00a060, 33%\u00a0\u2265\u00a060 years old). CR/CRi was achieved in 41% of patients (61%\u00a0<\u00a060, 33%\u00a0\u2265\u00a060 years old). Median survival was 6.1 months (15.7\u00a0<\u00a060, 5.2\u00a0\u2265\u00a060). Patients \u226560 who achieved a CR/CRi had a median survival of 11.7 months. At 12 months 56% of patients <60 were alive versus 24% of patients \u226560. At 24 months these numbers fell to 40% and 2% respectively. In those <60 years old, 50% went on to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) whereas 14% of patients in the \u226560 cohort did so. In conclusion, HAMA salvage therapy results in a 33% response rate in patients \u226560 years old with acceptable toxicity.",

We conducted a retrospective study of 21 patients with MPN-AML, 13 with MPN-AP and 11 with DIPSS-plus high-risk PMF treated with decitabine at our institution over the last 7 years and evaluated their clinical outcomes. Six patients (29%) with MPN-AML responded to decitabine (3 CR, 2 CRi, and 1 PR); median response duration was 7 months. The median overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in those who responded (10.5 vs 4 months).

In this clinical setting, by combining flow cytometry and CDR3 spectratyping we monitored the kinetic of the T-cell repertoire during Azacitidine treatment, in order to explore its potential ability to reverse the immune derangement typical of these disorders. We firstly demonstrated by flow cytometry an increase in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell frequencies after starting treatment. Moreover, when monitored by spectratyping our patients showed significant changes in their T-cell receptor (TCR) CDR3 profiles, which were much more evident in helper T-cells. In fact, the frequency of BV (beta variable) subfamilies showing a skewed CDR3 profile significantly decreased from baseline to the following evaluations in CD4+ T-cells (81% vs. 70%). This pattern was even more pronounced in patients responding to Azacitidine (90% vs. 61%). Our data show that the overall derangement of the T-cell repertoire detectable in patients with MDS and AML with multilineage dysplasia gradually improves during Azacitidine treatment. These findings therefore suggest that Azacitidine could be potentially able, not only to restore the hematopoietic function, but also to reverse the immune derangement typical of these hematologic disorders.",

The level of d18:1/16:0 ceramide in necroptosis was almost twice as high as that in apoptosis after 4\u00a0h, while an increase in PI-positive cells was observed only in necroptosis within 4\u00a0h. Necroptosis-resistant U937 (UNR) sublines were established to more clearly discriminate between necroptosis and apoptosis. All three UNR sublines were almost completely resistant to the treatment with TNF/VAD, but were as sensitive to TNF-induced apoptosis as parental cells. The expression of RIP3, a pivotal kinase in necroptosis, was lost in all three UNR sublines. In contrast with the large increase in ceramide levels in TNF/VAD-treated parental cells, they were only slightly increased in UNR cells. Although intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were elevated in both necroptosis and apoptosis, the treatment with butylated hydroxyanisole, an antioxidant, significantly inhibited increases in ceramide levels and PI-positive cells only in necroptosis. These results implicate that the ROS-induced large increase in ceramide levels may play a role in plasma membrane permeabilization in TNF-induced necroptosis.",

They support growth of cancer cells by promoting angiogenesis, and by inhibiting tumour cell apoptosis and anti-tumor immune reactions. Several membrane proteins are well-described markers of human TAMs, including the haemoglobin scavenger receptor CD163 and the macrophage mannose receptor (MR/CD206). Interestingly, both CD163 and MR exist as soluble serum proteins (sCD163 and sMR) that may reflect the activation state of tissue macrophages, including TAMs. Here, we report the first data on sMR as a biomarker in patients with a malignant disease. We have measured concentrations of sMR in peripheral blood serum (n\u00a0=\u00a0104) from patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (MM) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and examined associations with data from medical records. At diagnosis, sMR levels were elevated in 27% of patients, and decreased after treatment. Further, sMR levels were associated with prognostic markers in MM, and elevated sMR (>0.43\u00a0mg/L) was an independent marker of overall survival in a multivariate analysis (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.20, P\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

However, little is known about the protein expression level and function of A20 in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this study, we found that A20 is up-regulated in ALL patients and several cell lines. Knockdown of A20 in Jurkat, Nalm-6, and Reh cells resulted in reduced cell proliferation, which was associated with cell cycle arrest. Phospho-ERK (p-ERK) was also down-regulated, while p53 and p21 were up-regulated in A20 knockdown cells. In addition, A20 knockdown induced apoptosis in Jurkat and Reh cells and enhanced the sensitivity of these cell lines to chemotherapeutic drugs. These results indicate that A20 may stimulate cell proliferation by regulating cell cycle progression. A20 inhibited apoptosis in some types of ALL cells, thereby enhancing their resistance to chemotherapy. This effect was abolished through A20 silencing. These findings suggest that A20 may contribute to the pathogenesis of ALL and that it may be used as a new therapeutic target for ALL treatment.",

Primary BMECs secreted significantly increased levels of VEGF-A and PDGF-AB after exposure to cytarabine. Pazopanib, a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (RTKI) of VEGFRs, PDGFRs, and cKit, removed EC protection of AML cells and enhanced AML cell sensitivity to cytarabine.

Oncogenic mutations of RAS pathway genes (NRAS, KRAS, FLT3, n\u00a0=\u00a04) and deactivating mutations of major epigenetic regulators (CREBBP, EP300, each n\u00a0=\u00a02 and ARID4B, EZH2, MACROD2, MLL2, each n\u00a0=\u00a01) were prominent in these cases and virtually absent in non-recurrent cases (n\u00a0=\u00a06) or other pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases (n\u00a0=\u00a018).In relapse nucleotide variations were detected in cell fate determining transcription factors (GLIS1, AKNA). Structural genomic alterations affected genes regulating B-cell development (IKZF1, PBX1, RUNX1). Eleven novel translocations involved the genes ART4, C12orf60, MACROD2, TBL1XR1, LRRN4, KIAA1467, and ELMO1/MIR1200. Typically, patients harbored only single structural variations, except for one patient who displayed massive rearrangements in the context of a germline tumor suppressor TP53 mutation and a Li-Fraumeni syndrome-like family history. Another patient harbored a germline mutation in the DNA repair factor ATM.

Low-dose oral Clofarabine (1\u00a0mg daily for 7/28 days) proved both effective and safe for patients with MDS who had failed prior therapy.

To identify novel markers able to surrogate IGHV mutational status, CD19(+)CD5(+)-B-lymphocytes from 216 patients enrolled in a prospective study (ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier:NCT00917540), underwent gene expression profiling. Samples were split into CLL-Training (n\u00a0=\u00a0102) and CLL-Validation (n\u00a0=\u00a0114) sets, and an independent supervised analysis for IGHV mutational status was performed considering all genes with gene expression equal or above that of ZAP-70. Thirty-one genes (23 up- and 8 down-regulated) and 23 genes (18 up- and 5 down-regulated) satisfied these criteria in the CLL-Training and CLL-Validation sets, respectively, and 20 common genes (15 up and 5 down) were found to be differentially regulated in both sets. Two (SNORA70F, NRIP1) of the down-regulated and 6 (SEPT10, ZNF667, TGFBR3, MBOAT1, LPL, CRY1) of the up-regulated genes were significantly associated with a reduced risk of disease progression in both sets.

Overexpression is associated with an adverse prognosis in adults. In childhood, the genes have only been investigated in leukemias bearing MLL translocations. The aim of this study was to determine whether overexpression extends to leukemic subtypes other than the MLL-positive subtype in childhood. We use quantitative real-time PCR methodology to investigate gene expression in 100 children with acute leukemias and compare them to those of healthy controls. We show that abnormally high HOXA9 and MEIS1 gene expression is associated with a variety of leukemic subtypes, including various maturation stages of B-cell ALL and cytogenetic types other than the MLL-positive population, thus suggesting that the genes are implicated in the development of a broad range of leukemic subtypes in childhood. In addition, we show that HOXA9 and MEIS1 overexpression are inversely correlated with relapse and overall survival, so the genes could become useful predictive markers of the clinical course of pediatric acute leukemias.",

Among AML with normal karyotype (NK-AML) FLT3 activating mutation, internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), is present in about 30% of patients, conferring unfavorable outcome. Our previous data demonstrated specific up-regulation of miR-155 in FLT3-ITD+ AML. miR-155 is known to be directly implicated in normal hematopoiesis and in some pathologies such as myeloid hyperplasia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.To investigate about the potential influence of miR-155 de-regulation in FLT3-mutated AML we generated a transcription factors regulatory network and combined this with data from multiple sources that predict miR-155 interactions. From these analyses, we derived a sub-network, called \u201cmiR-155 module\u201d that describes functional relationship among miR-155 and transcription factors in FLT3-mutated AML. We found that \u201cmiR-155 module\u201d is characterized by the presence of six transcription factors as central hubs: four miR-155 regulators (JUN, RUNX1, FOSb, JUNB) and two targets of miR-155 (SPI1, CEBPB) all known to be \u201cmaster\u201d genes of myelopoiesis. We found, in FLT3-mutated AML, a significant down-regulation of miR-155 target genes CEBPB and SPI1 and up-regulation of miR-155 regulator genes JUN and RUNX1. We also showed that PKC412-related FLT3 inhibition, in MV4-11 cell line, causes down-regulation of miR-155 and increased level of mRNA and protein of miR-155 target SPI1. We showed in experiments of miR-155 mimic in K562 cell line, a high increase of miR-155 and an inverse correlation with the mRNA levels of its targets SPI1 and CEBPB. Moreover silencing of miR-155 in primary AMLs causes mRNA up-regulation of its target SPI1 and CEBPB.Our results suggest that activating mutation of FLT3 in AML can lead, through the induction of JUN, to an increased expression of miR-155, which then causes down-regulation of SPI1 and CEBPB and consequently may causes block of myeloid differentiation.",

The present study attempted to identify molecules that are regulated by STAT5 in CD34+/CD38\u2212 AML cells by utilizing cDNA microarrays, comparing the gene expression profiles of control and STAT5A shRNA-transduced CD34+/CD38\u2212 AML cells. Interestingly, DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 3A was downregulated after depletion of STAT5A in CD34+/CD38\u2212 AML cells. Reporter gene assays found that an increase in activity of DNMT3A occurred in response to activation of STAT5A in leukemia cells. On the other hand, dephosphorylation of STAT5A by AZ960 decreased this transcriptional activity. Further studies utilizing a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay identified a STAT5A-binding site on the promoter region of DNMT3A gene. Forced expression of STAT5A in leukemia cells caused hypermethylation on the promoter region of the tumor suppressor gene, PTEN, and downregulated its mRNA levels, as measured by methylation-specific and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively.Taken together, these data suggest that STAT5A positively regulates levels of DNMT3A, resulting in inactivation of tumor suppressor genes by epigenetic mechanisms in AML cells.",

We performed a structural analysis of CTGF mRNA by nested reverse-transcriptase PCR and examined CTGF protein diversity by immunoblotting.Northern blot analysis of pre-B ALL cell lines revealed short CTGF transcripts that were expressed in association with the active phase of cellular growth. Structural analysis confirmed the synthesis of several novel CTGF mRNA isoforms in B-lineage ALL cell lines that were uniformly characterised by the retention of the coding sequence for the C-terminal (CT) domain. One of these novel spliceforms was expressed in a majority (70%) of primary pre-B ALL patient specimens positive for canonical CTGF mRNA. Evidence that these alternative transcripts have coding potential was provided by cryptic CTGF proteins of predicted size detected by immunoblotting.This study identifies for the first time alternative splicing of the CTGF gene and shows that a short CTGF splice variant associated with cell proliferation is expressed in most cases of primary CTGF-positive pre-B ALL.

Some reports have described the presence of BCR-ABL on endothelial cells from CML patients, suggesting the origin of the disease in a primitive hemangioblastic cell. On the other hand, extracellular vesicles (EVs) released by CML leukemic cells are involved in the angiogenesis modulation process. In the current work we hypothesized that EVs released from BCR-ABL+ cells may carry inside the oncogene that can be transferred to endothelial cells leading to the expression of both BCR-ABL transcript and the oncoprotein.EVs from K562 cells and plasma of newly diagnosed CML patients were isolated by ultracentrifugation. RT-PCR analysis detected the presence of BCR-ABL RNA in the EVs isolated from both K562 cells and plasma of CML patients. The incorporation of these EVs into endothelial cells was demonstrated by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy showed that after 24\u00a0h of incubation most EVs were incorporated. BCR-ABL transcripts were detected in all experiments on endothelial cells incubated with EVs from both sources. The presence of BCR-ABL on endothelial cells incubated with Philadelphia+ EVs was also confirmed by Western blot assays.In summary, endothelial cells acquire BCR-ABL RNA and the oncoprotein after incubation with EVs released from Ph+ positive cells (either from K562 cells or from plasma of newly diagnosed CML patients).

Greater than 60% of ever-smokers were risk stratified as having low or intermediate-1 (int-1) risk at diagnosis based on the International Prognostic Scoring System for MDS.

However, development of resistance to imatinib therapy is also a very common mechanism observed with long-term administration of the drug. Our previous studies have highlighted the role of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in regulating the expression of multidrug resistant protein-1 (MDR1), P-gp, in imatinib-resistant K562 cells (IR-K562) via PGE2\u2013cAMP\u2013PKC\u2013NF-\u03baB pathway and inhibition of COX-2 by celecoxib, a COX-2 specific inhibitor, inhibits this pathway and reverses the drug resistance. Studies have identified that not only MDR1 but other ATP-binding cassette transport proteins (ABC transporters) are involved in the development of imatinib resistance. Here, we tried to study the role of COX-2 in the regulation of other ABC transporters such as MRP1, MRP2, MRP3, ABCA2 and ABCG2 that have been already implicated in imatinib resistance development. The results of the study clearly indicated that overexpression of COX-2 lead to upregulation of MRP family proteins in IR-K562 cells and celecoxib down-regulated the ABC transporters through Wnt and MEK signaling pathways. The study signifies that celecoxib in combination with the imatinib can be a good alternate treatment strategy for the reversal of imatinib resistance.",

Here we provide a thorough molecular characterization of a recently established cell line, CG-SH, which has normal cytogenetics, representing a useful new model for NK-AML. Using high-throughput DNA sequencing, we first defined the genetic background of this cell line. In addition to identifying potentially deleterious SNVs in genes relevant to AML, we also found insertions in both GATA2 and EZH2, two genes previously linked to AML. We further characterized the growth of this model system in vitro with a cytokine mix that promotes faster cell growth.

Cellular oxidative state is a credible target to selectively eradicate AML cells, because it is a fundamental property of each cell that is sufficiently different between leukemic and normal cells, yet its aberrancy shared among different AML cells. To this end, we tested whether a short-time treatment of AML cells, including cells with FLT3-ITD mutation, with sub-lethal dose of dichloroacetate (DCA) (priming) followed by pharmacologic dose of arsenic trioxide (ATO) in presence of low-dose DCA could produce insurmountable level of oxidative damage that kill AML cells. Using cellular cytotoxicity, apoptotic and metabolic assays with both established AML cell lines and primary AML cells, we found that priming with DCA significantly potentiated the cytotoxicity of ATO in AML cells in a synergistic manner. The combination decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential as well as expression of Mcl-1 and GPx in primary AML cells more than either drug alone. One patient with AML whose disease was refractory to several lines of prior treatments was treated with this combination, and tolerated it well. These data suggest that targeting cellular redox balance in leukemia may provide a therapeutic option for AML patients with relapsed/refractory disease.",

Combined exposure of 10058-F4 or JQ-1 and ABT-199 as well as vincristine or doxorubicin markedly suppressed the growth of DHL/THL cells compared with the single treatment.

L19-IL2 was shown to selectively localize at lymphoma lesions in vivo and to mediate significant lymphoma growth retardation, which was potentiated by co-administration of the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. When co-injected with rituximab, L19-IL2 induced complete remissions of localized MCL xenografts in 6/8 mice (75%), whereas the combination of rituximab and equivalent doses of non-targeted IL-2 only slightly delayed tumor growth. In disseminated MCL, combination therapy with L19-IL2 and rituximab exhibited a significant survival benefit over treatment with IL-2 and rituximab and completely eradicated the disease in 2/7 cases (28.6%).

The mutant form has the same asparaginase activity as wild-type but lacks glutaminase activity. Wild-type and dm HpA were compared with the clinically used ASNases from Escherichia coli (l-ASP) and Erwinia chrysanthemi (ERWase). Asparaginase activity was similar for all isoforms, while glutaminase activity followed the rank order: ERWase\u00a0>\u00a0l-ASP\u00a0>\u00a0wild-type HpA\u00a0>\u00a0dm HpA. Cytotoxic efficacy of ASNases was tested on 11 human leukemia cell lines and two patient-derived ALL samples. Two cell lines which we had previously shown to be asparagine-dependent were equally sensitive to the asparaginase isoforms. The other nine lines and the two patient-derived samples were more sensitive to isoforms with higher glutaminase activities. ERWase was overall the most effective ASNase on all cell lines tested whereas dm HpA, having the lowest glutaminase activity, was the least effective. These data demonstrate that asparaginase activity alone may not be sufficient for ASNase cytotoxicity, and that glutaminase activity may be required for full anti-leukemic efficacy.",

Here, we demonstrate that while there is no detectable difference in the hypoxic level of bone marrow infiltrated by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and healthy bone marrow, physiological hypoxia of 1% O2 itself leads to cell cycle arrest of AML blasts (both cell lines and primary AML samples) in the G0/G1 phase with upregulation of p27 and consecutive decrease of cells in the S phase. Hence, susceptibility of AML blasts toward cytarabine as S phase dependent drug is significantly decreased as shown by decreased cytotoxicity in vitro. In addition, cells exposed to hypoxia activate PI3K/Akt and increase expression of anti-apoptotic XIAP. Inhibition of PI3K can restore cytarabine sensitivity of AML blasts at hypoxic conditions.

We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 62 consecutive patients with advanced-stage MCL or relapsed DLBCL undergoing ASCT with (n\u00a0=\u00a031) or without (n\u00a0=\u00a031) prior CD34+ selection. All patients had stage III or IV disease, with 47% having DLBCL and 53% MCL. The median duration for neutrophil and platelet recovery was 12 and 16 days in CD34+ selected patients, and 11 (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001) and 14 days (P\u00a0=\u00a0.012) in the group without selection, respectively. No differences in toxicities were observed. The 5-year PFS for CD34+ selected versus not selected patients was 67% and 39% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.016), and the 5-year OS was 86% and 54% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). Our data suggest that using CD34+ selected autografts for ASCT in advanced stage MCL and DLBCL is associated with longer PFS and OS without increased toxicity.",

Two genes that have been used as prognostic markers in acute leukemia are Wilms\u2019 tumor (WT1) and multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1). A novel gene, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8), is often over-expressed and associated with poor outcome in some solid tumor types. However, whether EPS8 is also associated with the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unclear. Here, quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the expression of EPS8, MDR1, and WT1 in bone marrow samples of adult ALL patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0107) and non-leukemia controls (n\u00a0=\u00a022). EPS8, MDR1, and WT1 were detected in ALL patients, and significant correlations were found between expression profiles for EPS8 and MDR1, EPS8 and WT1, and MDR1 and WT1. In general, high expression of EPS8, MDR1, or WT1 in patients was associated with a higher risk of relapse. Furthermore, when patients were stratified based on high or low expression of the genes, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis indicated that disease-free survival of patients with the high-EPS8/high-WT1/high-MDR1 profile was significantly shorter than in patients with the low-EPS8/low-WT1/low-MDR1 profile or those excluded from either of these groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Thus, EPS8, as MDR1 and WT1, may be a clinically valuable biomarker for assessing the outcome of ALL patients.",

Inhibition of HSP90 holds promise for targeting multiple molecular abnormalities and is therefore an attractive target for heterogeneous malignancies such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).Ganetespib is a highly potent second generation HSP90 inhibitor which we show is significantly more effective against primary AML blasts at nanomolar concentrations when compared with cytarabine (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Dose dependant cytotoxicity was observed with an apoptotic response coordinate with the loss of pro-survival signaling through the client protein AKT. Combination treatment of primary blasts with ganetespib and cytarabine showed good synergistic interaction (combination index (CI): 0.47) across a range of drug effects with associated reduction in HSP70 feedback and AKT signaling levels.In summary, we show ganetespib to have high activity in primary AMLs as a monotherapy and a synergistic relationship with cytarabine when combined. The combination of cytotoxic cell death, suppression of cytoprotective/drug resistance mechanisms such as AKT and reduced clinical toxicity compared to other HSP90 inhibitors provide strong rationale for the clinical assessment of ganetespib in AML.",

Patients received a median number of 3 (range 1\u201327) cycles of decitabine and 12 patients received at least 6 cycles.Seven (19.4%) patients were responders including 3 marrow CR (mCR), 2 stable disease (SD) with HI-E, 1 SD with HI-N and HI-P and 1 SD with HI-N. In a CMML patient with SD, specific skin lesions resolved with decitabine. Responses were generally short lived (2\u20135 months) except 1 responder currently ongoing with +11 months follow up. Two non-responders had prolonged SD (without HI) of 21 and 27 months duration respectively. Median OS from onset of decitabine was 7.3 months, without significant difference between responders and non-responders.Treatment with decitabine after azacitidine failure yielded modest ORR (19.4%) with short response duration and poor OS. Thus, use of decitabine in such patients who failed or progressed after azacitidine cannot be recommended, underscoring the need for novel strategies in this setting.",

We sought to compare SWOG's reported EMR to that of the general population by utilizing the case listing session of SEER 18 matched to the accrual periods of the SWOG studies. 26,272 patients were identified within SEER compared to 968 in the SWOG cohort with mortality data. The EMR was 26.7% (7022 events) in the SEER cohort versus 12.2% (116) in the SWOG cohort. The EMR was higher in the SEER cohort in every studied age group and definition of EMR. Stepwise logistic regression analysis identified increasing age, black race (OR 1.15, CI 1.03-1.29, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and monocytic differentiation (OR 1.55, CI 1.27-1.89, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) as predictors of higher EMR.

     "abstract": "Hypomethylating agents (HMA), such as 5-azacitidine or decitabine, are currently used to treat patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) until treatment failure. However, the outcomes for patients who discontinue therapy after achieving partial response (PR) or complete remission (CR) but before treatment failure have not been reported. We present a series of 16 patients with higher-risk MDS (n\u00a0=\u00a05; 31%) or AML (n\u00a0=\u00a011; 69%) who achieved PR (n\u00a0=\u00a01) or CR (n\u00a0=\u00a015) and stopped HMA therapy while in response in the context of clinical trials. They received a median of 12 courses (range 1\u201324) and achieved response after a median of 1 course of therapy (1\u20134). Loss of response after discontinuation of therapy was rapid, with a median progression-free survival of 4 months (95% CI: 2\u20136). Median overall survival (OS) from the time of therapy discontinuation was 15 months (95% CI: 6\u201324). Patients who received 12 cycles of therapy or more had significantly better OS (median: 20 months [95% CI: 12\u201327]) than those who received fewer than 12 cycles (median: 4 months [95% CI: 1\u20138]) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Poor-risk cytogenetics were also associated with lower 1-year OS (33% versus 69%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.046).

Eleven patients showed the morphological features of polycythemia vera (PV), 11 of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) and six of essential thrombocythemia (ET). Molecular analyses identified the JAK2 V617F mutation in 27 patients; one of the JAK2-negative patients carried the MPL W515\u00a0K mutation, the other was \u201ctriple-negative\u201d (no JAK2, MPL or CALR mutation). On the basis of the WHO classification, three patients were classified as having PV, 11 as having PMF, and two as having ET; the remaining 13 cases fell into the MPN-unclassifiable category as there were discrepancies between their morphological and clinical features.In conclusion, our findings suggest that bone marrow histology should always be considered a key component of the diagnostic algorithm in patients with SVT, but that it is not enough to distinguish the different entities. This is particularly important because diagnoses of PV, PMF or ET have very different prognoses and obviously imply different therapies. It is therefore necessary to adopt a comprehensive approach that considers morphological, clinical and molecular data.",

Recently, aberrant methylation of the CHFR gene associated with gene silencing has been reported in several cancers. In the present study, we examined the expression of CHFR in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that the expression level of CHFR mRNA and protein was reduced in B-NHL tissue samples and B cell lines. Furthermore, CHFR methylation was detected in 39 of 122 B-NHL patients, which was not found in noncancerous reactive hyperplasia of lymph node (RH) tissues. CHFR methylation correlated with the reduced expression of CHFR, high International Prognostic Index (IPI) scores and later pathologic Ann Arbor stages of B-NHL. Treatment with demethylation reagent, 5-Aza-dC, could eliminate the hypermethylation of CHFR, enhance CHFR expression and cell apoptosis and inhibit the cell proliferation of Raji cells, which could be induced by high expression of CHFR in Raji cells. Our results indicated that aberrant methylation of CHFR may be associated with the pathogenesis, progression for B-NHL, which might be a novel molecular marker as prognosis and treatment for B-NHL.",

We noted significant differences in the FA profile of plasma from patients with MM when compared to the control group. Increased levels of saturated and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids in MM patients suggest that there may be increased endogenous synthesis of these fatty acids, likely due to increased expression of desaturase and elongase. Furthermore, cluster analysis showed differences in the distribution of FA in plasma from MM patients compared to controls.

Compared to previous criteria based on absolute lymphocyte count rather than absolute B-cell count, utilizing the 2008 WHO criteria resulted in a 47.6% decline in CLL incidence (8.42 cases per 100,000 using 1996 criteria). As a consequence, MBL rates are 64% higher. In contrast to 1996 criteria showing a peak CLL incidence between ages 70-74, age-specific incidence rates show a continuous increase with advancing age using the 2008 guidelines. We also report a higher male to female ratio of CLL than previous Canadian reports (1.80:1). CLL incidence in southern Alberta is lower than rates recently reported in the United States using the same criteria. This difference may be due in part to the low median age and the lower proportion of persons of Caucasian European ancestry present in our study population.",

     "abstract": "Despite aggressive chemotherapy, approximately one-third of children with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) relapse. More effective treatments are urgently needed. Survivin is an inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein with key roles in regulating cell division, proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, high expression of Survivin has been associated with poor clinical outcome in AML. The Survivin suppressant YM155 (Sepantronium Bromide) has pre-clinical activity against a range of solid cancers and leukemias, although data in AML is limited. Therefore, we undertook a comprehensive pre-clinical evaluation of YM155 in paediatric AML. YM155 potently inhibited cell viability in a diverse panel of AML cell lines. All paediatric cell lines were particularly sensitive, with a median IC50 of 0.038\u00a0\u03bcM. Cell cycle analyses demonstrated concentration-dependent increases in a sub-G1 population with YM155 treatment, suggestive of apoptosis that was subsequently confirmed by an increase in annexin-V positivity. YM155-mediated apoptosis was confirmed across a panel of 8 diagnostic bone marrow samples from children with AML. Consistent with the proposed mechanism of action, YM155 treatment was associated with down-regulation of Survivin mRNA and protein expression and induction of DNA damage.These data suggest that YM155-mediated inhibition of Survivin is a potentially beneficial therapeutic strategy for AML, particularly paediatric disease, and warrants further evaluation.",

     "abstract": "The acquisition of anti-cancer drug resistance is a major limitation of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma (MM) and it is thus important to identify the mechanisms by which MM cells develop such drug resistance. In a previous study, we showed that multidrug resistance (MDR) involves the overexpression of MDR1 and survivin in vincristine-resistant RPMI8226/VCR cells. However, the underlying mechanism of MDR remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of MDR in RPMI8226/VCR cells, and found that RPMI8226/VCR cells exhibit increased levels of activated ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-\u03baB, while the levels of activated mTOR, p38MAPK, and JNK do not differ between RPMI8226/VCR cells and their vincristine-susceptible counterparts. In addition, the inhibition of ERK1/2, Akt, or NF-\u03baB by inhibitors reversed the drug-resistance of RPMI8226/VCR cells via the suppression of survivin expression, but did not affect MDR1 expression; RNA silencing of survivin expression completely reversed vincristine resistance, while MDR1 silencing only weakly suppressed vincristine resistance in RPMI8226/VCR cells. These results indicate that enhanced survivin expression via the activation of ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-\u03baB plays a critical role in vincristine resistance in RPMI8226/VCR cells. Our findings suggest that ERK1/2, Akt, and NF-\u03baB inhibitors are potentially useful as anti-MDR agents for the treatment of vincristine-resistant MM.",

We found a significantly increased expression of p16INK4A in BCP-ALLs with MLL rearrangement. Telomerase activity was significantly lower in Philadelphia chromosome-negative/IKAROS-deleted (BCR-ABL1\u2212/IKAROSdel) cases compared to Philadelphia chromosome-positive (BCR-ABL1+) BCP-ALLs. In BCR-ABL1+ ALLs, high CDK4 expression, phosphorylated pRb (p-pRb) and telomerase activity were significantly associated with a shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and event-free survival (EFS). Enhanced p16INK4A expression was only related to a significantly shorter DFS. In vitro analyses of normal stimulated lymphocytes after short- and long-term cultures demonstrated that the observed protein variations of poor prognosis in BCR-ABL1+ ALLs may be related to cell activation but not to cell aging. For these patients, our findings argue for the development of therapeutic strategies including the addition of new lymphocyte activation inhibitors to current treatments.",

Negative regulators such as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) inhibit activated JAK2/STAT signaling. However, whether silencing of negative regulators facilitates JAK2/STAT signaling is unclear. Here, we report that loss of miR-375 expression contributes to the constitutive activation of JAK2/STAT signaling. MiR-375 reduced JAK2 protein level and repressed the activity of a luciferase reporter by binding 3\u2032-untranslated regions, which was abolished by the mutation of the predicted miR-375-binding site. Meanwhile, a significant inverse correlation between the expressions of miR-375 and JAK2 was found in multiple types of leukemic cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells from MPN patients, suggesting that JAK2 may be a miR-375 target gene. Furthermore, forced expression of miR-375 inhibited constitutive and inducible JAK2/STAT signaling, suppressed cell proliferation, and decreased colony formation in hematopoietic progenitors from MPN patients. Finally, histone deacetylation (HDAC) inhibitors restored miR-375 expression, which was much lower in patients with MPN compared with healthy volunteers. Collectively, our data suggest that the loss of miR-375 expression enhances the constitutive and persistent activation of JAK2/STAT signaling.

These ligands are capable of activating a broad spectrum of intracellular signalling cascades that can either induce apoptosis or protect from programmed cell death. BAFF and APRIL, which can directly activate the NF-\u03baB pathway, have been identified as crucial survival factors for ALL cells. Here, we have analyzed serum BAFF, APRIL and TRAIL concentrations in 48 patients with newly diagnosed ALL and 44 healthy volunteers. The levels of APRIL and BAFF were significantly higher in ALL patients as compared to healthy volunteers. In contrast, concentrations of TRAIL were significantly lower in ALL patients. Moreover, following induction, the levels of APRIL, but not BAFF or TRAIL, were significantly lower in a group of patients with complete remission (CR) as compared to non-respondent (NR) ALL patients. Furthermore, we demonstrated statistically significant differences in concentrations of APRIL between CR MRD-negative and CR, MRD-positive ALL patients.

Dexamethasone and siomycin A caused a significant reduction in gene expression levels of FoxM1 in Jurkat cells. Targeting FoxM1 by siomycin A and dexamethasone caused a significant decrease in T-ALL cell line proliferation through induction of G1 cell cycle arrest.

We showed that ARS2 expression in ALL bone marrow samples at initial diagnosis was markedly lower than that in complete remission (CR). Likewise, the levels of ARS2 expression in the patients suffering from relapse were significantly lower than that of patients in continuous CR. Furthermore, low expression of ARS2 was closely correlated to poor treatment response including poor prednisone response and high minimal residual disease (MRD), and the patients with high MRD (\u226510\u22124) and low ARS2 were more subject to relapse. The multivariate analyses for relapse free survival and event free survival revealed that ARS2 expression remained an independent prognostic factor after adjusting other risk factors. In addition, combined assessment of ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expression was more accurate to predict relapse, based on which an algorithm composed of ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expression, prednisone response and MRD (day 78) was proposed. Together, ARS2 and CASP8AP2 expressions can precisely predict high-risk of relapse and ALL prognosis.",

A total of 11 patients with de novo AML were treated, including 2 with relapsed and/or refractory disease and 9 older patients with previously untreated AML. Patients with high baseline leukocyte count were excluded. Erlotinib was given orally at 150\u00a0mg per day continuously in 28-day cycles. The treatment was tolerated well, and no toxicities were observed. An initial reduction in circulating blasts, followed by disease progression, was observed in 2 patients. Nine other patients did not demonstrate any response in blood or bone marrow. Baseline and post-cycle 1 flow-cytometry were performed on bone marrow blasts to investigate signs of differentiation. No immunophenotypic changes suggestive of differentiation were observed. This pilot study did not demonstrate response to standard doses of erlotinib in patients with AML.",

We investigated whether statin use could have different clinical impacts on immunohistochemical DLBCL subtypes in the rituximab era.We analyzed data from 409 patients with de novo DLBCL who received R-CHOP therapy. During median follow-up time of 38.6 months, 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in the GC type were similar to those in the non-GC type (PFS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.125; OS, p\u00a0=\u00a00.201).

To answer this question, we retrospectively reviewed our cytogenetic archives and identified 31 patients with isolated +15. Four patients presented with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), +15 was the major clone (56\u201395% of interphases) in BM and the clonal size of +15 was correlated with blast burden and disease status. For the remaining 27 patients, +15 was a minor clone (3\u201324% of interphases) in BM. Eighteen patients had a history of cytotoxic therapies and developed +15 after a median latency interval of 34 months. Six patients had BM involvement by lymphoma or myeloma, and +15 was exclusively detected in myeloid and erythroid cells, not in lymphoma or myeloma cells. With a median follow-up of 28 months, none of these 27 patients had clinical or morphological evidence of myelodysplastic syndromes. We conclude that +15 can be associated with AML, but more often isolated +15 presents as a minor clone in BM, and may not be disease associated. Clinical follow-up rather than an immediate therapeutic intervention seems most appropriate for non-leukemic patients with isolated +15.",

We evaluated four genetic screening methods for their ability to detect a series of different CALR mutations; Sanger sequencing, fragment analysis PCR, high resolution melt (HRM) and targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). The limit of detection (LoD) of each assay was tested using serial dilution series made with DNA from CALR positive sample DNA and a cell line, MARIMO, found to carry a heterozygous 61 nucleotide CALR deletion.

For each course, serum samples for NTBI detection were taken prior to chemotherapy, during treatment and during subsequent bone marrow myelosuppression: NTBI was assessed by HPLC. Appearance of NTBI was observed from the start of induction treatment and was still detectable during bone marrow myelosuppression; the recovery of the bone marrow function coincided with the disappearance of NTBI. This kinetic was observed in all subsequent high doses chemotherapy courses, independently from confounding variables such as transfusional iron intake and transferrin saturation. NTBI seems to be a consequence of chemotherapy induced lysis of bone marrow cells and, partly, of hepatocytes after cytotoxic injury. The subsequent persistence of NTBI throughout bone marrow myelosuppression is related to the transient suspension of erythropoietic activity. Moreover, NTBI levels >2\u00a0\u03bcM at the beginning of iatrogenic myelosuppression were associated with higher risk of sepsis caused by Gram negative Bacilli (RR 2.571), also compared with other infectious complications (RR 1.954).",

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a malignant and aggressive disease not sensitive to chemotherapy. The dynamic interaction between AML cells and bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays a critical role in response of this disease to chemotherapy. It is reported that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are essential component of bone marrow microenvironment which affects the survival of AML cells. The aim of our research is to elucidate the mechanism of drug resistance of AML cells associated with MSC. We found that adhesion of AML cell lines U937, KG1a and primary AML cells to MSC inhibited cytotoxic drug-induced apoptosis. Western blot showed that c-Myc of AML cells cocultured with stroma was up-regulated. Treatment with 10058-F4, a small molecule inhibitor of MYC-MAX heterodimerization, or c-Myc siRNA significantly induced apoptosis. Western blot analysis further showed that inhibition of c-Myc induced expression of caspases-3, cleavage of PARP and reduced expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Thus, we conclude that MSCs protected leukemia cells from apoptosis, at least in part, through c-Myc dependent mechanisms, and that c-Myc contributed to microenvironment-mediated drug resistance in AML. In summary, we declared that c-Myc is a potential therapeutic target for overcoming drug resistance in AML.",

In hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, Lmo2 is part of a protein complex comprised of class II basic helix loop helix proteins, Tal1and Lyl1. The latter transcription factors heterodimerize with E2A proteins like E47 and Heb to bind E boxes. LMO2 and TAL1 or LYL1 cooperate to induce T-ALL in mouse models, and are concordantly expressed in human T-ALL. Furthermore, LMO2 cooperates with the loss of E2A suggesting that LMO2 functions by creating a deficiency of E2A. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in Lmo2-induced T-ALL cell lines. We transduced these lines with an E47/estrogen receptor fusion construct that could be forced to homodimerize with 4-hydroxytamoxifen. We discovered that forced homodimerization induced growth arrest in 2 of the 4 lines tested. The lines sensitive to E47 homodimerization accumulated in G1 and had reduced S phase entry. We analyzed the transcriptome of a resistant and a sensitive line to discern the E47 targets responsible for the cellular effects. Our results suggest that E47 has diverse effects in T-ALL but that functional deficiency of E47 is not a universal feature of Lmo2-induced T-ALL.",

However, the prognostic impact of gene mutations in the context of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unclear. We retrospectively evaluated the clinical implications of 8 gene mutations in 325 adult AML patients; 100 of them received allo-HSCT and 225 did not. The genetic alterations analyzed included NPM1, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, CEBPA, RUNX1, RAS, MLL-PTD, and WT1. In patients who did not receive allo-HSCT, older age, higher WBC count, higher lactate dehydrogenase level, unfavorable karyotype, and RUNX1 mutation were significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS), while CEBPA double mutation (CEBPAdouble-mut) and NPM1mut/FLT3-ITDneg were associated with good outcome. However, in patients who received allo-HSCT, only refractory disease status at the time of HSCT and unfavorable karyotype were independent poor prognostic factors. Surprisingly, RUNX1 mutation was an independent good prognostic factor for OS in multivariate analysis. The prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD or NPM1mut/FLT3-ITDneg was lost in this group of patients receiving allo-HSCT, while CEBPAdouble-mut showed a trend to be a good prognostic factor. In conclusion, allo-HSCT can ameliorate the unfavorable influence of some poor-risk gene mutations in AML patients. Unexpectedly, the RUNX1 mutation showed a favorable prognostic impact in the context of allo-HSCT. These results need to be confirmed by further studies with more AML patients.",

Down-regulating CD44 could be clinically relevant not only for suppression of the deregulated function of LSPC but also in LSPC response to chemotherapeutic agents. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) delivery is a promising approach for AML treatment, and we recently reported effective siRNA delivery into difficult-to-transfect AML cell lines using lipid-substituted polyethylenimine/siRNA complexes (polymeric nanoparticles). In this study, we investigated polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 in CD34+ LSPC cell models (leukemic KG-1 and KG-1a cell lines) as well as primary AML cells. Polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing decreased surface CD44 levels in KG-1, KG-1a and primary AML cells by up to 27%, 30% and 20% at day 3, respectively. Moreover, CD44 silencing resulted in induction of apoptosis in KG-1 cells, reduced adhesion of KG-1 and KG-1a cells to hyaluronic acid-coated cell culture plates and BM-MSC, and decreased adhesion of primary AML cells to BM-MSC. Our results suggest that polymeric nanoparticle-mediated silencing of CD44 might be a useful technique for inhibiting LSPC interactions with their microenvironment, thereby prohibiting leukemia progression or sensitizing LSPC to chemotherapy.",

Flow cytometry analysis revealed no accumulation in a specific phase of the cell cycle upon CHK1 inhibition. Accordingly, lentiviral-mediated CHK1 overexpression increased the proliferation rate of FLT3-ITD expressing cells, as judged by cell viability and [3H] thymidine incorporation experiments. By contrast, expression of a ser280 mutant did not, suggesting that phosphorylation of this residue is an important determinant of CHK1 proliferative function. Clonogenic growth of primary leukemic cells from patients in semi-solid medium was reduced upon CHK1 inhibition, confirming the data obtained with leukemic established cell lines. Surprisingly, 3 out of 4 CHK1 inhibitory compounds tested in this study were also potent inhibitors of the FLT3-ITD tyrosine kinase receptor.

CSL360 is a chimeric IgG1 monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD123 (IL-3 receptor \u03b1-subchain) expressed in the absence of CD131 (\u03b2-subchain), an epitope that is displayed by leukemia stem cells (LSCs). We are studying CSL360 modified with diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) for complexing 111In and 13-mer nuclear translocation sequence (NLS) peptides to enable nuclear importation in LSCs for Auger electron radioimmunotherapy (RIT) of AML. We demonstrate that microSPECT/CT imaging using 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 revealed engraftment of primary human AML specimens into the BM and spleen of NOD/SCID mice. Our results suggest that microSPECT/CT imaging is a powerful tool which enables non-invasive assessment of the engraftment of AML into NOD/SCID mice and in the current study specifically probes an epitope displayed by the LSC subpopulation. The targeting of 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 to sites of AML engraftment in the NOD/SCID mouse model is encouraging for future RIT studies. Ultimately, SPECT imaging could be applied in AML patients to assess the delivery of 111In-DTPA-NLS-CSL360 to sites of leukemia and be combined with Auger electron RIT using the same agent targeting the LSC population as a \u201ctheranostic\u201d pair.",

Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OMA), formerly known as homoharringtonine, is a cephalotaxus alkaloid derivative and an inhibitor of protein synthesis without tyrosine kinase activity developed 35 years ago by Chinese investigators in the treatment of leukemia. This compound demonstrates specific activity in CML and has been recently commercialized in the U.S. for the treatment of patients in chronic or accelerated phase CML with resistance and/or intolerance to two or more tyrosine kinase inhibitors or harboring a T315I ABL mutation. CML patients with a T315I mutation experienced poor overall survival rates in the pre-ponatinib era (median for CP CML 24 months).

According to CCI stratification, 71 patients had score 0 and 110 a score\u00a0\u2265\u00a01. Imatinib standard dose was reduced at start of therapy (200\u2013300\u00a0mg/day) in 68 patients independently from the evaluation of baseline comorbidities, but based only on physician judgement: 43.6% of these patients had score 0 compared to 34% of patients who had score\u00a0\u2265\u00a01. Significant differences were found in terms of subsequent dose reduction (39% of patients with score 0 compared to 53% of patients with score\u00a0\u2265\u00a01) and in terms of drug discontinuation due to toxicity (35% of patients with score 0 vs 65% of patients with score\u00a0\u2265\u00a01). We did not find significant differences as regards occurrence of hematologic side effects, probably as a consequence of the initial dose reduction: 39% of patients with score 0 experienced grade 3/4 hematologic toxicity (most commonly anemia) compared to 42% of patients with score\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.

These scoring systems use clinical and laboratory data developed predominately in persons of European descent. Splenomegaly is not a prognostic variable in any of these scoring systems. Recently, we reported differences in clinical and laboratory features between Chinese vs. persons of European descent with PMF. Based on this we developed a modified prognostic model to predict survival of Chinese subjects in which splenomegaly is an independent favorable prognostic factor. In the current study, we analyzed data from 874 Chinese with PMF including 495 with splenomegaly. Subjects with splenomegaly had significantly higher hemoglobin concentrations (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), higher levels of WBCs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), platelets (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), excess blood blasts (\u22651%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), less RBC-transfusion-dependence (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lower DIPSS risk distribution (P\u00a0=\u00a00.024). Frequency of JAK2V617F (62% vs. 50%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) was also different.

Thrombocythemia is one of the hallmarks in the early stages of these neoplasms. Several non-hematological cancers are associated with reactive thrombocythemia, which has been shown to have a major negative impact upon survival. In regard to treatment of MPNs a \u201cwait and watch\u201d strategy is recommended in patients with low-risk disease. Another strategy implies early treatment with interferon-alpha2 (IFN) to prohibit clonal evolution.

The inhibitory rates of tumor weight were 2.67%, 10.69%, and 25.57% in DFO, ATO and combination therapy groups, respectively. The combination of DFO with ATO induces significantly more tumor cell apoptosis than either agent alone (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Mononuclear cells were isolated from the bone marrow of a patient with atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (Ph\u2212/bcr\u2212/abl\u2212), and were passaged by liquid culture. Cells were maintained without any cytokines for over 1 year, and named NT-1. This cell line was extensively characterized using morphological assays, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis, clonogenic culture, quantitative fluorescent PCR, short tandem repeating sequence PCR (STR-PCR) and array-CGH. Its tumorigenic capacity was also examined in nude mice. The NT-1 cell line had morphological features of chronic myeloid leukemia and major myeloid markers (CD13, CD33, CD11b). Additionally, NT-1 expressed progenitor cells and natural killer cell-related antigens such as CD34, CD117, CD56. Cytogenetic analysis initially demonstrated two abnormalities: 47, xx, +8 and 47, xx, +8 accompanied by t(5;12)(q31;p13) translocation. The one-year passage process did not alter the karyotype. NT-1 cells maintained the same morphology, immunophenotyping and cytogenetic features as primary leukemia cells, which was strongly supported by STR-PCR results. Neither Epstein\u2013Barr virus nor mycoplasma was detected in the NT-1 line. In addition, NT-1 cells showed high tumorigenic capacity in nude mice. NT-1 is a new atypical chronic myeloid leukemia cell line with the +8 and t(5,12) translocation, and exhibits high tumorigenicity in nude mice.

Interestingly, targeted inhibition of NHE1 further promoted the differentiation of K562 cells with CIAPIN1 silencing. Accordingly, ectopic expression of NHE1 reversed this phenotype. Furthermore, ERK1/2 inhibition with the chemical inhibitor, PD98059, abolished CIAPIN1 silencing-induced differentiation of K562 cells after NHE1 inhibition.

The synergistic effect of the combination of three agents was more significant than the combination of ATRA and ATO. These results were confirmed with NBT staining. These effects were not related to apoptosis. Annexin-V-fluorescein staining revealed that a combination of ATRA and ATO and combination of the three agents did not induce apoptosis in NB4 cells.

Second, their correlation ( C \u02c6 min ( 400 mg ) ) with reported treatment response was verified. Low imatinib levels were predicted in young male patients and those receiving P-gp/CYP3A4 inducers.

Although patients who gather lymphocytosis during dasatinib have superior responses, there is only little data about the correlation between PE, response rates, and survival. In order to answer this question, the aim of our study was to determine the frequency of PE and lymphocytosis among our CML patients receiving second-line dasatinib, and to compare the responses and outcomes between patients with or without PE. There were 18 patients (44%) who developed PE, in a total of 41 patients, with a median time of 15 months. Lymphocytosis was observed in nine patients (9/41, 22%) with a median duration of 6.5 months of dasatinib treatment. There were fourteen patients with at least one comorbidity that may play a role in the generation of PE. The cumulative MMR and CCyR rates were greater in PE+ patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

We explored some underlying mechanisms and the potential relevance of the combination quercetin\u2013menadione for clinical applications. In acute treatments, quercetin manifested a strong antioxidant character, but induced a transient loss of \u0394\u03c8m, likely mediated by opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. After removal of quercetin, persistent mitochondrial hyperpolarization was generated via stimulation of respiratory Complex I. In contrast, menadione-induced \u0394\u03c8m dissipation was only partially and transiently reversed after menadione removal. Results indicate that Ca2+ release is a necessary event in quercetin-induced cell death and that the survival response to quercetin is delineated within 1\u00a0h from exposure. Depending on dose, the two agents exhibited either antagonistic or synergistic effects in reducing clonogenicity of Jurkat cells. 24-h combinatorial regimens at equimolar concentrations of 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcM, which are compatible with a clinically achievable (and safe) scheme, reduced cell viability at efficient rates.

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most common form of acute leukemia affecting adults. Although it is a complex disease driven by numerous genetic and epigenetic abnormalities, nearly 50% of patients exhibit a normal karyotype (CN-AML) with an intermediate cytogenetic risk. However, a widespread genomic analysis has recently shown the recurrence of genomic aberrations in this category (mutations of FLT3, CEBPA, NPM1, RUNX1, TET2, IDH1/2, DNMT3A, ASXL1, MLL and WT1) thus revealing its marked genomic heterogeneity. In this perspective, a global gene expression analysis of AML patients provides an independent prognostic marker to categorize each patient into clinic-pathologic subgroups based on its molecular genetic defects. Consistently such classification, taking into account the uniqueness of each AML patient, furnishes an individualized treatment approach leading a step closer to personalized medicine. Overall the genome-wide analysis of AML patients, by providing novel insights into biology of this tumor, furnishes accurate prognostic markers as well as useful tools for selecting the most appropriate treatment option. Moreover it provides novel therapeutic targets useful to enhance efficacy of the current anti-AML therapeutics. Here we describe the prognostic relevance of such new genetic data and discuss how this approach can be used to improve survival and treatment of AML patients.",

Then, A20 attenuation with siRNA in AML-DC enhanced the expression of several co-stimulatory molecules and proinflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, after A20 attenuation in AML-DCs, the autologous cytolytic T cells (CTLs) induced by AML-DCs had higher killing capability and specificity for primary AML cells. Additionally, receptor-interacting protein (RIP) and the NF-\u03baBp65 pathway were elevated in AML-DCs when A20 was reduced. Hence, this study identified A20 as a negative regulator for controlling AML-DC maturation and immunostimulatory potency, as A20 down-regulation resulted in AML-DCs with enhanced autologous CTLs immune capacity through the NF-\u03baB pathway.",

We retrospectively analyzed 168 de novo DLBCL patients in this study and found that a low LMR (\u22642.6) correlates with B symptoms, elevated LDH, advanced Ann Arbor stage and higher international prognostic index (IPI) score (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The low LMR is a negative prognostic parameter for overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) in non-germinal center (GC) type DLBCL patients, as compared with the high LMR, especially in those treated with R-CHOP. However, the LMR has less correlation with the OS and EFS in GC type DLBCL patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.545 and 0.547, respectively). Multivariate analysis adjusting for IPI revealed that the low LMR indicates a shorter survival retain both OS and EFS in non-GC subtypes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023 and 0.005, respectively). In the non-GC DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP a low LMR still showed a trend to predict poor EFS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.052). In conclusion, these data suggest that a low LMR at diagnosis may imply a poor prognosis in non-GC subtype DLBCL patients, especially in those treated with R-CHOP, but not in those GC subtype DLBCL patients.",

However only the age, CNS involvement, omission of cyclophosphamide, and total delay during treatment were associated with survival in multivariate analysis. Omission of second cyclophosphamide dose had no impact on survival of standard risk group patients, but adversely affected the long term survival of medium risk group (MRG) patients. The second dose might be given with the first dose on day 36 to MRG patients to prevent delays.

MIP-1 alpha, sclerostin and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bALP) levels were quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

Mortality was 70% among non-chelated, 40% among chelated, 32% among patients chelated \u22656\u00a0m, and 30% among patients chelated adequately; with a trend toward reduced cardiac mortality in chelated patients. Overall, median overall survival (OS) was 10.2 years for chelated and 3.1 years for non-chelated patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). For patients chelated \u22656\u00a0m or patients classified as adequately chelated, median OS was 10.5 years. Mortality increased as a function of average monthly transfusion intensity (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) but was lower in patients receiving adequate chelation or chelation \u22656\u00a0m (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.24, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).Six or more months of adequate ICT is associated with markedly better overall survival. This suggests a possible survival benefit of ICT in transfusion-dependent patients with lower-risk MDS.",

The present study was aimed to investigate the methylation status of CTNNA1 promoter region using methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and its clinical relevance in Chinese AML patients. Patients with CTNNA1 hypermethylation had significantly lower level of CTNNA1 transcript than those without CTNNA1 hypermethylation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.031). The relationship of CTNNA1 methylation with clinical parameters was evaluated. Aberrant hypermethylation of CTNNA1 gene was found in 23.9% (37/155) AML cases.

     "abstract": "Discovery of imatinib mesylate (IM) as the targeted BCR-ABL protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) has resulted in its use as the frontline therapy for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) across the world. Although high response rates are observed in CML patients who receive IM treatment, a significant number of patients develop resistance to IM. Resistance to IM in patients has been associated with a heterogeneous array of mechanisms of which point mutations within the ABL tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) are the frequently documented. The types and frequencies of mutations reported in different population studies have shown wide variability. We screened 125 Malaysian CML patients on IM therapy who showed either TKI refractory or resistance to IM to investigate the frequency and pattern of BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations among Malaysian CML patients undergoing IM therapy and to determine the clinical significance. Mutational screening using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) followed by DNA sequencing was performed on 125 IM resistant Malaysian CML patients. Mutations were detected in 28 patients (22.4%). Fifteen different types of mutations (T315I, E255K, G250E, M351T, F359C, G251E, Y253H, V289F, E355G, N368S, L387M, H369R, A397P, E355A, D276G), including 2 novel mutations were identified, with T315I as the predominant type of mutation. The data generated from clinical and molecular parameters studied were correlated with the survival of CML patients. Patients with Y253H, M351T and E355G TKD mutations showed poorer prognosis compared to those without mutation. Interestingly, when the prognostic impact of the observed mutations was compared inter-individually, E355G and Y253H mutations were associated with more adverse prognosis and shorter survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025 and 0.005 respectively) than T315I mutation. Results suggest that apart from those mutations occurring in the three crucial regions (catalytic domain, P-loop and activation-loop), other rare mutations also may have high impact in the development of resistance and adverse prognosis. Presence of mutations in different regions of BCR-ABL TKD leads to different levels of resistance and early detection of emerging mutant clones may help in decision making for alternative treatment. Serial monitoring of BCR-ABL1 transcripts in CML patients allows appropriate selection of CML patients for BCR-ABL1 KD mutation analysis associated with acquired TKI resistance. Identification of these KD mutations is essential in order to direct alternative treatments in such CML patients.",

Aberrant lymphocytes and smudge cells were enumerated and correlated with CLL immunophenotype, chromosomal aberrations and prognostic parameters. Herein, we show that the percentages of aberrant and smudge cells was highly variable between patients and did not correlate with each other. Increased aberrant lymphocytes and fewer smudge cells were associated with an atypical immunophenotype including low expression of CD23, higher levels of FMC7 and bright surface levels of CD20. High fraction of aberrant lymphocytes also was associated with trisomy 12. These cells were predominantly of small/medium size, sometimes with cleft nuclei. No correlation was noted between aberrant or smudge cells and clinical stage, CD38, ZA70 or time to first treatment. Taken together, automated morphological analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes emerged as a powerful and robust tool for the quantitative morphological stratification of CLL.

Comorbidity, physical capacity and nutritional status retained their significance even in multivariate analyses in 50%, 75%, and 67% of analyses respectively, whereas age and performance status lost their predictive value in most studies. One study found an association between comorbidity and chemotherapy-related non-haematological toxicity. In another study a pronounced association between summarised outcome of geriatric assessment and chemotherapy-related toxicity as well as response to treatment was described.This review demonstrates that a geriatric assessment can detect multiple health issues, even in patients with good performance status.

After the expression of SNX2-ABL1 proteins, Ba/F3 cells acquired an ability to proliferate in an IL-3-independent manner. Upon treatment with both imatinib and dasatinib, BCR-ABL1-expressing Ba/F3 cells underwent rapid apoptosis, whereas SNX2-ABL1-expressing Ba/F3 cells showed poorer sensitivity toward these TKIs and could proliferate in the presence of a low dose of dasatinib. Therefore, other TKIs with a more selective effect against this chimeric kinase should be used for the treatment of patients with SNX2-ABL1+ ALL.",

In this study, we research the mechanism by which JS-K kills a murine erythroleukemia cell line and determine the roles of NO and arylation in the process. Our studies indicate that JS-K inhibits the PI 3-kinase/Akt and MAP kinase pathways. This correlates with the activation of the tumor suppressor FoxO3a and increased expression of various caspases, leading to apoptosis. The arylating capability of JS-K appears to be sufficient for inducing these biological effects. Overall, these data suggest that JS-K kills tumor cells by arylating and inactivating signaling molecules that block the activation of a tumor suppressor.",

We also investigated if changes in cytogenetic or expression level of DNA repair proteins led to changes in sensitivity to a novel PARP inhibitor, CEP-8983, alone and in combination with bendamustine. No changes in promoter methylation were identified in BRCA1, BRCA2, FANC-C, FANC-F, FANC-L, ATM, MGMT, hMLH1 and H2AX except for two cases of minor BRCA1 hypermethylation. CLL samples appeared to have reduced BRCA1 mRNA expression uniformly in comparison to non-malignant lymphocytes irrespective of promoter hypermethylation.

CE was detected in 15.7% (22/140) of patients using FISH, in 28.6% (40/140) using CBA, and in 34.3% (48/140) of patients by combining both methods.

Canadian hematologists who treat ALL were surveyed electronically. Overall, 69 of 173 physicians responded (40%).

However, only a minority of respondents felt that age >35 years was an indication for alloHCT in CR1. Almost all respondents (96%) felt that a well-matched unrelated donor was an acceptable alternative to a sibling donor. There was uncertainty about the role of cord blood (53% agree) and the utility of reduced intensity conditioning HCT (41% agree). In contrast to the results of the MRC/ECOG study, respondents considered alloHCT to be particularly helpful in high-risk patients. Consensus was lacking on the use of cord blood, RIC alloHCT, and the application of MRD.

This study aimed to evaluate these genes in MDS patients. The cytogenetics analysis was carried out by G-banding, AURKA and AURKB amplification was performed using FISH, and AURKA, AURKB, CDC20 and MAD2L1 gene expression was performed by qRT-PCR in 61 samples of bone marrow from MDS patients. AURKA gene amplification was observed in 10% of the cases, which also showed higher expression levels than the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.038). Patients with normo/hypercellular BM presented significantly higher expression levels than hypocellular BM patients, but normo and hypercellular BM groups did not differ. After logistic regression analysis, our results showed that HIGH expression levels were associated with increased risk of developing normo/hypercellular MDS. It also indicated that age is associated with AURKA, CDC20 and MAD2L1 HIGH expression levels. The distinct expression of hypocellular patients emphasizes the prognostic importance of cellularity to MDS. The amplification/high expression of AURKA suggests that the increased expression of this gene may be related to the pathogenesis of disease.",

Using a unique keyword algorithm, we queried all electronic pathology (E-path) reports sent to the state of Florida cancer registry in 2006 to identify potential MDS cases. A stratified, random sample of E-path reports was then reviewed to confirm diagnosis and assign MDS subtype. Characteristics were compared between captured and uncaptured MDS cases. 7111 E-path reports with MDS keyword hits were identified, of which only 18% linked to a registered MDS case, 47% linked to a different cancer, and 34% did not link with any record. Case review of a stratified, random sampling of 285 individuals led to the discovery that uncaptured cases made up 37.7% of the total true MDS cases in 2006. It is estimated that the true incidence of MDS is 5.3 individuals out of 100,000, compared to previous reports of 3.3 out of 100,000. Uncaptured MDS cases were younger and more likely to have information in the pathology report facilitating MDS subtype assignment. Only two-thirds of true MDS cases are captured in Florida using current case-finding mechanisms. Application of a keyword search strategy to identify cases among E-path reports is a feasible technique to improve MDS case ascertainment.",

We examined the effects of resveratrol, a well-known polyphenolic compound, on cell proliferation and survival of HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines, MT-2 and HUT-102. We found that resveratrol suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell death of MT-2 and HUT-102 cells. Immunoblot analysis showed inhibition of myeloid cell leukemia sequence (Mcl)-1 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein (cIAP)-2 expression as well as signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 and Ser727 in resveratrol-treated cells. We also observed cleavage of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in resveratrol-treated cells, indicating that resveratrol induces caspase-dependent apoptosis in MT-2 and HUT-102 cells. In addition, the STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 not only induced cell growth arrest and cell death but also activated caspase-3 in MT-2 and HUT-102 cells, indicating that STAT3 may be a therapeutic target for ATL.

An individual miRNA species can simultaneously influence the expression of multiple genes and conversely, several miRNAs can synchronously control expression of specific gene product mRNA levels. Thus, miRNAs expression in cells has to be precisely regulated and alterations in miRNA levels may cause an aberrant expression of genes involved in oncogenic pathways and consequently result in cancer development. Indeed, miRNA expression is often deregulated in many cancers, including B-cell lymphomas. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a heterogeneous group of B-cell lymphomas with different genetic backgrounds, morphologic features, and responses to therapy. Over the past decade, miRNAs emerged as a new tool for understanding DLBCL biology, and promising candidate molecular markers in DLBCL classification and treatment.

A series of 271 consecutive APL patients has been cytogenetically investigated between 2004 and 2011 in our institution. The incidence of ACAs was 27% (46/172) in APL cases with t(15;17). Trisomy 8 was the most recurrent abnormality, accounting for 30% (14/46) of patients with ACAs, followed by +21 (7%, 3/46) and \u22127/7q (7%, 3/46). Nine cases (14.1%) were found to have additional balanced translocation aberrations, most of them are new and non-recurrent. Treatment protocols consisted of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and chemotherapy with or without the ATO therapy. Overall, patients with and without ACAs had similar complete remission (CR) rates (94% and 98%, respectively, P\u00a0=\u00a00.344). With a median follow-up of 41 months, univariate analysis showed that ACAs did not show any prognostic significance in relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). In addition, ATO treatment was an independent favorable predictor for RFS. Thus, this data provides insights into cytogenetic features of APL, and suggests that ATO-based combination therapy improved RFS in de novo APL patients, while ACAs had no impact on prognosis.",

Twenty-seven of 44 patients (61.3%) with abnormal karyotypes achieved a cytogenetic response, including 18 cases with complete cytogenetic response (cCR). The patients carrying poor or very poor karyotypes achieved better clinical and cytogenetic response than those with intermediate or good karyotypes. Among the patients with poor or very poor karyotypes, those carrying chromosome 7 aberrance showed a better treatment response than the other patients. Four patients (22.2%) of the patients who achieved clinical CR presented with a cytogenetic PR (partial response) or NR (no response). Over 5% of the clonal cells determined by FISH analysis were in the two patients who presented cytogenetic CR. Longer median OS (24 months) were observed in the patients who achieved a cytogenetic response than in those who did not (12 months) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The patients with poor or very poor karyotypes could achieve survival comparable to that of the patients with good or very good karyotypes after decitabine treatment (18 vs. 20 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.365). IPSS-R cytogenetic risk stratification could be used to predict the clinical and cytogenetic response to decitabine treatment in MDS patients, and the predicting effect may be related to chromosome 7 involvement.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether TNF-\u03b1 can induce apoptosis in FLT3-ITD-positive AML cells and to elucidate the influence of TRAF2. Stable lentiviral mediated down-regulation of TRAF2 resulted in a decrease of phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein AKT and its downstream target GSK-3\u03b2.

Using the Namalwa B-cell line, we established that the assay is sensitive enough to detect 200 clonal cells in the analyzed sample. Very similar clonal results were obtained between DNA from DBS and fresh whole blood from patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Although there are some promising treatment modalities, great majority of patients with this disease remain incurable. The B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling plays a crucial role in B-cell biology and lymphomagenesis. Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) has been identified as a key component of the BCR signaling pathway. Evidence suggests that the blockade of BTK activity by potent pharmacologic inhibitors attenuates BCR signaling and induces cell death. Notably, the expression levels and the role of BTK in MCL survival are still elusive. Here, we demonstrated a moderate to strong BTK expression in all MCL cases (n\u00a0=\u00a019) compared to benign lymphoid tissues. Treatment of MCL cell lines (Mino or Jeko-1) with a potent BTK pharmacologic inhibitor, Ibrutinib, decreased phospho-BTK-Tyr223 expression. Consistent with this observation, Ibrutinib inhibited the viability of both Mino and JeKo-1 cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Ibrutinib also induced a concentration-dependent apoptosis in both cell lines. Consistently, Ibrutinib treatment decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1 protein. These findings suggest that BTK signaling plays a critical role in MCL cell survival, and the targeting of BTK could represent a promising therapeutic modality for aggressive lymphoma",

Here, using a genetically engineered C57BL/6 mouse model expressing the GFP fluorescent molecule under the control of the Sfpi1 promoter, which we have bred onto the rAML-susceptible CBA/H strain, we demonstrate that GFP expression did not interfere with X-ray induced leukaemia incidence and that GFP fluorescence in live leukaemic cells is a surrogate marker of radiation-induced chromosome 2 deletions with or without point mutations on the remaining allele of the Sfpi1 gene. This study presents the first experimental evidence for the detection of this leukaemia initiating event in live leukemic cells.",

Purpose was to investigate the expression levels of SDF-1\u03b1 before and after bortezomib and thalidomide treatment. From February 2006 to April 2012, CXCR4 expression was prospectively assessed in bone marrow samples from a large population of patients (n\u00a0=\u00a0227) using flow cytometry.

Our results show that CXCR4 was present in 43.2% (98/227) of newly diagnosed MM patients and that CXCR4 expression was significantly correlated with CD117 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). CXCR4-positive MM patients had a significantly longer estimated survival time than CXCR4-negative patients (median of 48 vs. 42 months, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

K562 erythroleukemia cells contain muscarinic receptors M2, M3 and M4, and activation of muscarinic receptors changes cell proliferation. We examined the effects of several compounds on cell proliferation in K562 erythroleukemia cells. These included a muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol (CCh), a protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine; the phospholipase C inhibitor U73122, the MEK 1\u20132 inhibitor UO126, the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, the Ca2+ chelators BAPTA/AM and 2-aminoethoxy-diphenylborate (2APB). In addition, we also investigated muscarinic receptor mediated protein kinase C (PKC) expression in K562 cells.CCh caused a decrease in DNA synthesis in K562 cells supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum after starvation. Pre-treatment of K562 cells with U73122 and BAPTA/AM antagonized the inhibitory effect of CCh, suggesting that phospholipase C and intracellular calcium are involved in CCh-mediated inhibition of proliferation in K562 cells. Our data also suggest that the regulatory roles of protein kinase C and the MAPK/ERK pathways in K562 cell proliferation are independent of cholinergic activation.",

Scoring of CD68 was based on the percentage of CD68 positive TAM compared to the total number of cells in representative areas. The final percent of CD68 positivity for each case was based on the average of cores available for examination.In a univariate analysis, we found that patients with elevated levels of CD68 positive TAM had inferior overall survival (OS) compared with patients who had lower CD68 levels. For patients undergoing autologous stem cell transplant after salvage treatment, elevated CD68 levels were predictive of both adverse OS and event free survival.

With both models a significant correlation between higher score and shorter TTFT could be found.

Both models provided similar results in terms of sensitivity (MDACC score, 61.5%; modified German score, 57.7%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.79), whereas specificity was significantly higher for MDACC score (72.1% versus 63%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The prognostic utility of either MDACC or modified German score was assessed by time-dependent Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results of this comparative analysis showed that after the 2nd year area under curve (AUC) for TTFT was higher than 0.60 for both models and kept unmodified this trend over the time.

We postulated that ATRA treatment enhances migration and adhesion abilities possibly enabling APL cells to inhabit extramedullary sites. We revealed an increase in adhesion, migration and invasion capabilities of NB4 cells following ATRA treatment. ATRA induced upregulation of Pyk2 mRNA, protein and phosphorylation levels and enhanced Pyk2 interaction with paxillin and vinculin. Pyk2 inhibition resulted in a reduction of NB4 cell adhesion and migration following ATRA treatment. These results indicate that in vitro Pyk2 might function to regulate cell adhesion and motility following ATRA treatment and its upregulated expression may contribute to EMD development in APL patients.",

     "abstract": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal stem cell disorders characterized by abnormal hematopoietic differentiation and maturation, which progress toward acute leukemia in approximately 30% of the cases. Drug metabolism polymorphisms in Cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6), Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and Dehydrogenase Quinone 1 (NQO1) enzymes and P-glycoprotein (MDR-1) could modify enzyme activity. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify the influence of CYP2B6 G15631T, GSTT1, GSTM1, NQO1 C609T and MDR-1 C3435T polymorphisms on MDS progression. We analyzed 78 MDS patients using the PCR-RFLP and multiplex method. The frequency of GST deletions and MDR-1 CC genotype was lower in progression-free patients compared to patients with progression; GST: 17% vs. 35% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018); MDR-1 gene: 19% vs. 48% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012).

We concluded that GSTM1 deletion may contribute toward MDS progression probably due to toxic metabolite accumulation which generates cell toxicity and DNA damage. Moreover, MDR-1 C3435T may have a protective effect against MDS progression because the expected lower expression of P-glycoprotein would lead to a higher degree of cell death. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the relationship of these polymorphisms with MDS progression.",

In SV40 infected/transfected purified B-cells, during the time course analyses, viral DNA sequences were detected by PCR, while Tag mRNA and protein were revealed by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, respectively. Trypan blue and Alamar blue assays showed an increase in number of cells and cell viability of infected/transfected B-cells up to day 50, then a drastic and constant cell number reduction was observed in cultures. Approximately 50% of both infected and transfected B-cells appeared morphologically transformed. SV40 viral progeny and its titer from infected B-cells was determined by plaque assay in permissive CV-1 cells. Our data indicate that human B-cells can be efficiently infected by SV40, release a viral progeny, while at the same time are transformed.

To characterize what has been observed in isolated EMR, we investigated 287 consecutive AL patients (144 acute myeloid leukemia; 138 acute lymphocytic leukemia; 5 acute mixed-lineage leukemia) who underwent allo-SCT. Twelve cases experienced relapse at extramedullary sites without concomitant involvement of the bone marrow (BM). The onset to relapse after allo-SCT was longer in extramedullary sites than in the BM (median, 10 months versus 5.5 months). EMR sites varied widely and included the central nervous system, skin, bone, pelvis and breasts. Univariate analysis demonstrated that cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated significantly with the onset of isolated EMR (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The prognosis for patients who develop EMR remained poor but was relatively better than that after BM relapse (overall survival, 10 versus 18 months). Compared with local or single therapy, patients treated with systemic treatment in combination with local treatment could yield a favorable prognosis. In conclusion, we observed a significant number of isolated cases of EMR in AL patients after allo-SCT, cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated significantly with the onset of isolated EMR. We found that intensive approaches combining local and systemic therapy could produce favorable responses which may cure a proportion of these patients.",

The water solubility of AGM130 is more enhanced than that of the original form of Indirubin, which has very poor water solubility.

     "abstract": "The mechanisms by which hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSC and HPC) from myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) undergo ineffective production of blood cells and disease transformation into acute myeloid leukemia remain to be investigated. It has been confirmed that increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under various pathological conditions impairs HSC self-renewal and causes HSC premature exhaustion and BM suppression primarily via induction of HSC senescence, and oncogene induces accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and subsequently cellular senescence, which functions as an important barrier to prevent the growth of transformed cells to form a neoplasia. Here we investigated whether MDS CD34+ cells enriched with HSC and HPC undergo senescence through accumulation of ROS and DNA damage and their action mechanisms. In this study, the percentages of SA-\u03b2-gal positive senescent CD34+ cells increased in lower-risk MDS patients, but not in higher-risk MDS and AML patients, compared to that of healthy controls. The increases were associated with an elevated expression of p21 but not the activation of p38. Further study found that there were increased ROS and DNA damage in CD34+CD38\u2212 cells enriched with HSC progression from lower-risk MDS, higher-risk MDS to AML. Therefore, these data suggest that CD34+ cells from patients with lower-risk MDS present p21 dependent premature senescence, increased accumulation of ROS and DNA damage in CD34+CD38\u2212 cells could contribute to this process; however, CD34+ cells from patients with higher-risk MDS could develop some mechanisms to uncouple ROS and DNA damage induced senescence.",

In this study, using the K562 CML cell line we showed that inhibition of Bcr\u2013Abl signalling, by either Imatinib or Nilotinib, led to a significant reduction in ROS levels which was concurrent with the GSK-3\u03b2 dependent, post-translational down-regulation of the small membrane-bound protein p22phox, an essential component of the Nox complex. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p22phox in these cells established its importance in ROS production and proliferation.

In addition to the JAK2V617 mutation several other mutations have been described. Recently chronic inflammation has been proposed as a trigger and driver of clonal evolution in MPNs. Herein, it is hypothesized that sustained inflammation may elicit the stem cell insult by inducing a state of chronic oxidative stress with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the bone marrow, thereby creating a high-risk microenvironment for induction of mutations due to the persistent inflammation-induced oxidative damage to DNA in hematopoietic cells. Alterations in the epigenome induced by the chronic inflammatory drive may likely elicit a \u201cepigenetic switch\u201d promoting persistent inflammation. The perspectives of chronic inflammation as the driver of mutagenesis in MPNs are discussed, including early intervention with interferon-alpha2 and potent anti-inflammatory agents (e.g. JAK1-2 inhibitors, histone deacetylase inhibitors, DNA-hypomethylators and statins) to disrupt the self-perpetuating chronic inflammation state and accordingly eliminating a potential trigger of clonal evolution and disease progression with myelofibrotic and leukemic transformation.",

     "abstract": "Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable plasma cell malignancy, which causes a significant morbidity due to organ damage and bone tissue destruction. In recent years, novel drugs have become available for MM therapy thanks to a more deepened knowledge of this disease's pathogenesis. The perspective of employing targeted therapies has considerably changed the expectations on the clinical outcome for patients affected by this malignancy and among the targetable molecules identified for MM therapy are several protein kinases, which have been proven to play relevant roles in supporting malignant plasma cell growth by regulating critical signaling cascades and by sustaining oncogenic mechanisms. Protein kinase CK2 (formerly known as casein kinase 2) and GSK3 (glycogen synthase kinase 3) are two multifaceted serine-threonine kinases whose task in the pathogenesis of malignant cell growth is increasingly emerging both in solid and blood tumors. In hematologic malignancies, CK2 and GSK3 have been shown to play an oncogenic function in chronic and acute leukemias as well as in MM. They have been demonstrated to act by impinging on pivotal signaling pathways that control malignant clone growth. We will herein briefly review the more recent advancements on the role of these two kinases in regulating the NF-\u03baB, STAT3 and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling in MM and discuss the rationale of using small selective inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy to hamper the growth of malignant plasma cells or to improve the MM-associated bone disease.",

Half of the patients had extramedullary disease, most commonly leukemia cutis, which often preceded bone marrow involvement and six had therapy-related AML.

This suggests that the t(8;16) translocation could be sufficient to induce hematopoietic cell transformation to AML without acquiring other genetic alteration.

Mutations were not detected in patients before commencing imatinib treatment.

The mutants differed in rapidity of emergence which appeared to arise in different time frame as well as in speed of rising mutant levels.

In this study, we investigated the methylation status of the CpG island of SALL4 promoter region in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) using methylation-specific PCR (MSP). Aberrant hypomethylation of SALL4 gene was found in 21.7% (18/83) of the cases analyzed. A significantly positive correlation was identified between the level of SALL4 transcript and the status of SALL4 hypomethylation (R\u00a0=\u00a00.641, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No correlation was found between SALL4 hypomethylation and clinical parameters. However, the frequency of SALL4 hypomethylation significantly increased in higher risk MDS (14% in Low/Int-1 versus 39% in Int-2/High, P\u00a0=\u00a00.031). The association between SALL4 hypomethylation and the mutations in three methylation modifiers (IDH1, IDH2 and DNMT3A) was not observed. Although the estimated 50% survival time of the SALL4-hypomethylated group was shorter than that of SALL4-methylated group (11.0 months vs. 20.0 months), the difference was not statistically significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.430). These findings suggest that hypomethylation of SALL4 promoter is a common event in MDS.",

Forced expression of SGOL1 in hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) significantly increased colony numbers for CFU-M and CFU-GM compared with control vector transduced infected HSPCs, suggesting that SGOL1 might act as an oncogene in hematopoietic cells. In addition, we found that repression of SGOL1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) slowed the proliferation of NB4, EOL-1 and U937 cells compared with the control siRNA transfected cells, in parallel with the appearance of precocious dissociation of centromeric cohesion and separation of sister chromatids in these cells. Furthermore, we found that repression of SGOL1 by siRNA accumulated EOL-1 and U937 cells in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle, in conjunction with up-regulation of the spindle checkpoint protein BubR1, followed by apoptosis via caspase pathways. Thus, SGOL1 might be a promising molecular target for treating individuals with AML.",

Patient-specific individual BCR-ABL1 fusion sites were successfully detected in 10 out of 13 patients. Dried blood stains represent a valuable resource for genomic DNA analyses. Long term preservation is easily manageable in paper envelopes with the patient's medical files with a minimum of financial costs and efforts. Such the cooperation between laboratories and hospitals separated by long distances is facilitated rendering possible offering specialized genomic analyses to patients with CML virtually everywhere around the world.

Twentieth-century case descriptions and series with hypotheses about the etiology and nature of disorders described as \u201crefractory anemia\u201d, \u201cpreleukemia\u201d, and with other terminology culminated in the efforts of the French-American-British (FAB) Co-operative Group of morphologists, whose landmark 1976 and 1982 papers provided the first widely-used classification of MDS. More recent developments in the MDS field include new mechanistic biological insights, regulatory approval of several somewhat-effective treatments, and improved organizational support and advocacy.

The prognostication is done according to the IPSS or very recently to the revised IPSS by a combination of cytopenia, morphologic features according to the WHO classification (2008) and cytogenetic results. In addition, also molecular markers have been shown to contribute important information for diagnosis and also for prognosis in patients with MDS. These markers are in some cases found by next generation sequencing including whole exome sequencing of patients with MDS.

In two cases of CBF AML associated with systemic mastocytosis (SM), the persistence of mast cells and the detection of a high ratio of fusion transcript, in bone marrow, during the courses of chemotherapy, led us to determine whether the mast cell component of the disease carried the same molecular alterations as leukaemic blasts.

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the growth and accumulation of cells blocked in their ability to differentiate, and blocks production of normal blood cells. The response to induction chemotherapy is heterogeneous, therefore biomarkers that predict for the outcome of such treatment are of potential value. FCHSD2 in a sensitized screen was identified as a potential chemo-protector (TW Mak, unpublished). In the present study, we found that FCHSD2 knockdown by shRNA could enhance chemosensitivity of U937 cells. This coincided with the increased expression of p21 and PUMA as well as the decreased expression of Bcl-2, c-myc and hTERT. In contrast, over-expression of FCHSD2 significantly increased cellular chemoresistance. To see if there was potential clinical relevance of FCHSD2 expression in leukemia we used qRT-PCR to assess FCHSD2 expression levels in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts of 71 AML patients. There was an inverse correlation between the level of FCHSD2 with overall survival time (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.7647, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and relapse free time (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.8165, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). By dividing patients into high and low expression groups using a FCHSD2 expression threshold value of 0.001, the median survival of the high expression group (72 days) was shorter than in the low expression group (2472 days). The average FCHSD2 expression level in 41 patients with complete remission was significantly lower than that in 30 non-responder patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Moreover, in 32 de novo AML patients receiving initial remission-induction chemotherapy, we confirmed that the patients with lower FCHSD2 expression prior to the treatment had an increased chance of attaining remission compared to patients with high level FCHSD2. In conclusion, our study, for the first time, demonstrates FCHSD2 as a predictor of outcome for AML patient. The determination of FCHSD2 expression at the time of diagnosis could help to identify the responses of AML patients to chemotherapy.",

SF3B1 mutations were found in 55 subjects (53%) including 25 of 39 with refractory anemia and RS (RARS), 26 of 45 (58%) of those with refractory cytopenia with multi-lineage dysplasia and RS (RCMD-RS), 3 of 6 with refractory anemia with excess blasts-1-RS (RAEB1-RS) and 1 of 14 with RAEB2-RS. There were significant correlations between SF3B1 mutation state and platelet levels (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007), mean RBC corpuscular volume (MCV; (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), proportion of RS (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and percent bone marrow erythroblasts (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012) and myeloblasts (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044). Multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards regression model including sex, age, SF3B1 mutation state, hemoglobin concentration, absolute neutrophil level, platelet level, MCV, international prognostic scoring system (IPSS) cytogenetics category, WHO morphologic category and treatment showed SF3B1 mutation state to independently predict survival. These data increase our knowledge of the impact of SF3B1 mutations in persons with MDS. They indicate a similar favorable impact of SF3B1 mutation on survival in Chinese with MDS as reported for persons of European descent.",

Moreover in the absence of PRH, dasatinib does not inhibit cell survival as effectively as in PRH expressing cells. Thus the re-establishment of gene control by PRH is in part responsible for the therapeutic effects of dasatinib.",

     "abstract": "Angiogenesis is a complex process controlled by the balance of a large number of regulating factors, the pro- and anti-angiogenic factors. Dysregulation of angiogenesis occurs in various pathologies and is one of the hallmarks for cancer. Recent emphasis on the microenvironment's influence in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) progression and drug resistance nurtures the interest in angiogenesis. Researchers have already identified a variety of angiogenic factors involved in the CLL, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), angiopoietin-2(Ang-2), thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), as well as extracellular proteinases such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). Besides modulating neovascularization, angiogenic factors also participate in the regulation of pro-survival effects of CLL cells. However, the precise mechanism involved still needs to be elucidated further. At present, the levels of some angiogenic factors are regarded as prognostic markers of the progression of CLL, although it is not widely used. Several anti-VEGF agents are currently under clinical trial. Advances in the understanding of the bases of angiogenesis regulators will be benefit for the comprehension of CLL pathogenesis and help to conquer the disease.",

The plasma ratio of 5:1 was maintained at all dose levels. Nearly all of the detectable cytarabine and daunorubicin in circulation following CPX-351 administration was in the form of liposome encapsulated drug.

     "abstract": "p23 is a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) cochaperone that plays a significant role in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha signal transduction and telomerase activity; it is up-regulated in several cancers. Recent studies have found that high level of p23 may promote tumor progression and poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. p23 was found to be overexpressed in our previous microarray assay of 100 childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) bone marrow (BM) samples. In the present study, we verified the upregulation of p23 in clinical ALL samples, and identified p23 to be an anti-apoptotic factor in the process of chemotherapy. We also found that p23 was regulated by hsa-miR-101 which was down-regulated in childhood ALL cases. Altogether these data demonstrate that the misregulation of hsa-miR-101 contributes partly to the overexpression of p23 in childhood ALL. As an anti-apoptotic factor, p23 is able to be a potential target for anti-leukemic therapy.",

Factors predicting a better outcome after relapse were stem cell transplant (SCT) performed in second CR and a first CR duration >1\u00a0year. Risk groups defined at the time of diagnosis and treatment received in first CR also influenced the outcome after relapse. The best results were obtained in patients with core binding factor (CBF)-AML, while patients initially defined as favorable intermediate risk showed a similar outcome after relapse than those initially entering the poor risk group. We conclude that most adult patients with recurring AML could not be rescued using current available therapies, although allogeneic SCT remains the best therapeutic option at this stage of the disease.",

Various molecular methods have been developed, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of T-cell receptor \u03b3 (TCR\u03b3). The detection of PCR products usually relies commonly on either GeneScan (GS) analysis or heteroduplex (HD) analysis by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). These techniques have their disadvantages, being relatively time-consuming and laborious or requiring expensive equipment. Here, we propose an alternative method that combines multiplex PCR and HD analysis by microcapillary electrophoresis (ME) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. The sensitivity of the method was determined with clonal PEER T-cell line DNA dilution in polyclonal DNA and was evaluated as 1\u20135%. Fifty-three samples from patients with T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders were analyzed by HD analysis using ME and GS analyses. Comparison of the two techniques showed them to be highly concordant (93% similarity). The rate of clonality detection by GS analysis was higher than HD analysis by ME, but none of the discordant patients (n\u00a0=\u00a05) has yet developed lymphoma. HD analysis by ME to reveal TCR\u03b3 gene rearrangements in clinical specimens was consistent with clinical data and the outcome of patients. Detection of T-cell clonality by HD analysis with ME is sensitive, practical, safe and represents a potential alternative to PAGE and GS analysis.",

Although allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is considered potentially curative, very few patients have been reported who have undergone allo-SCT for MPN-BP; therefore the success rate remains unknown. In a retrospective review, we identified 13 patients with an MPN transformation to blast phase after a median 9 years (range 5 months to 30 years); 8 (median age 55) continued to allo-SCT within 6 months. Induction chemotherapy cleared blood/marrow blasts in 60% (6/10) (2 declined therapy, 1 had early death). At the time of allo-SCT, 5/8 patients were in complete remission (CR) of their leukemia or had returned to MPN chronic phase (CP), 2 had residual blood blasts and 1 was refractory with >5% marrow blasts. At follow-up (median 20.3 months), 6 patients are alive in CR of both their leukemia/MPN. All 5 patients in CR/CP at pre-allo-SCT remain alive in remission, while 2/3 with persistent blood/marrow blasts relapsed and expired.

The importance of Rad for bortezomib resistance was supported by three observations. First, Rad knockdown overcame bortezomib resistance and induced mitochondrial apoptosis via Noxa/Bcl-2 modulation. Second, Rad decreased cell death in response to bortezomib. Third, leukemia and lymphoma cell lines (K-562, Raji, IM-9 and Jurkat-R) with elevated Rad expression levels showed higher degrees of bortezomib resistance versus those (Sup-B15, JVM-2, U266 and Jurkat) with low Rad expression levels (r\u00a0=\u00a00.48, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0004).

At present, 48 chromosomal bands have been identified to be involved in ETV6 translocations, insertions or inversions and 30 ETV6 partner genes have been molecularly characterized. The ETV6 protein contains two major domains, the HLH (helix-loop-helix) domain, encoded by exons 3 and 4, and the ETS domain, encoded by exons 6 through 8, with in between the internal domain encoded by exon 5. ETV6 is a strong transcriptional repressor, acting through its HLH and internal domains. Five potential mechanisms of ETV6-mediated leukemogenesis have been identified: constitutive activation of the kinase activity of the partner protein, modification of the original functions of a transcription factor, loss of function of the fusion gene, affecting ETV6 and the partner gene, activation of a proto-oncogene in the vicinity of a chromosomal translocation and dominant negative effect of the fusion protein over transcriptional repression mediated by wild-type ETV6. It is likely that ETV6 is frequently involved in leukemogenesis because of the large number of partners with which it can rearrange and the several pathogenic mechanisms by which it can lead to cell transformation.",

     "publication date": "08-2012",
     "abstract": "DNA methylation and histone methylation are both involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression and their dysregulation can play an important role in leukemogenesis. Aberrant DNA methylation has been reported to silence the expression of tumor suppressor genes in leukemia. Overexpression of the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, a subunit of the polycomb group repressive complex 2 (PRC2), was observed to promote oncogenesis. This is due to aberrant gene silencing by the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) by EZH2. Since both these epigenetic silencing events are reversible, they are interesting targets for chemotherapeutic intervention by using an inhibitor of DNA methylation, such as 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxcytidine (5-AZA-CdR), and 3-deazaneplanocin-A (DZNep), an inhibitor of the EZH2. Human HL-60 and murine L1210 leukemic cells exposed in vitro to 5-AZA-CdR and DZNep in combination showed a synergistic loss of clonogenicity in a colony assay as compared to each agent alone. This positive chemotherapeutic interaction was also observed in mice with L1210 leukemia. Quantitative PCR showed that the combination also produced a remarkable synergistic activation of the tumor suppressor genes, CDKN1A and FBXO32. Microarray analysis showed that 5-AZA-CdR plus DZNep produced a synergistic activation of >150 genes. Our results indicate that 5-AZA-CdR plus DZNep can reactivate target genes that are silenced by two distinct epigenetic mechanisms leading to a loss of the proliferative potential of leukemic cells.",

Most preclinically and clinically investigated HDACi target classes I, II and IV, but only few are selective in inhibiting specific HDACs. Here we analyzed the in vitro antileukemic activity of three novel hydroxamate derivatives, the pan-HDAC-inhibitors ST13, ST34 and the known HDAC6 inhibitor ST80, treating leukemia cell lines HL60, Kasumi-1, NB-4, THP-1, K562, U937, Jurkat as well as primary AML blasts. In cell lines all three compounds exerted a strong growth-inhibitory effect at low micromolar concentrations. ST13 increased acetylation of H3, H4 and \u03b1-tubulin, while ST34 preferentially acetylated histones H3 and H4. Interestingly, ST80 preferentially induced \u03b1-tubulin acetylation at low micromolar doses, confirming a selective inhibition of HDAC6 by ST80 in leukemic cells. These observations were also confirmed in primary AML blasts cultured ex vivo. Growth-inhibition by ST80 was independent of pre-treatment HDAC6 protein expression and in contrast to ST13 and ST34, ST80 did not result in induction of p21/WAF. Immunofluorescence imaging confirmed that ST80 treatment both increased the abundance and resulted in unilateral local accumulation of acetylated \u03b1-tubulin. In conclusion, the three novel HDACi show potent antileukemic activity in myeloid cell lines and primary AML blasts at low micromolar concentrations. Preferential acetylation of \u03b1-tubulin implies that ST80 might exert its antileukemic effect not through histone reacetylation but rather through inhibition of HDAC6.",

Combination chemotherapy has had little impact on the long term survival of these patients. ATLL cells are characterised by the expression of CD25 (IL-2R\u03b1), which is not expressed in normal resting T-cells. Daclizumab (Zenapax\u00ae) is a humanised murine anti-CD25 monoclonal antibody, which contains 10% murine CDR sequences. In this prospective trial 15 patients with aggressive ATLL were treated with CHOP-Zenapax (CHOP-Z) to determine the tolerability and feasibility of this novel regimen as well as evaluate its efficacy. Eleven patients had acute ATLL and four had the lymphoma subtype. The main presenting features were elevated LDH (100%), lymphocytosis (73%), lymphadenopathy (67%), skin lesions (40%), hypercalcaemia (53%), and hepato-splenomegaly (27%). Ten (67%) patients received the six scheduled cycles. Complete response (CR) lasting for two months or more was seen in 5 (33%), partial response in 3 (20%), minor response in 1 (7%), and no response in 6 (40%) patients. The median overall survival was 10 months (95% CI: 0.05\u201320.88) but this was significantly longer among responders (18 months) compared to non responders (3\u00a0months) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019). For patients who achieved CR the disease free survival (DFS) was 15 months while the event-free survival (EFS) was 5 months. In conclusion CHOP-Z is safe and in those who achieve a complete response it was associated with prolonged overall survival.",

This was studied in blasts obtained from nine patients with AML and one patient with CML by ex vivo culture in the presence of Q-VD-OPh (QVD), a pan caspase inhibitor. Cell differentiation was manifested by the expression of markers of monocytic differentiation CD11b and CD14. Differentiation induced by 1\u03b1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D) or its analogs PRI-1906 and PRI-2191 was enhanced by QVD to a varying degree, depending on the subtype of the leukemia. QVD and 1,25D-induced differentiation was accompanied by increased signaling by Hematopoietic Progenitor Kinase 1(HPK1), and the expression of transcription factors known to be involved in monocytic differentiation was increased. Although the magnitude and nature of these changes were not invariable, it is clear that caspase inhibitors warrant attention as components of differentiation therapy of leukemia, perhaps in combination with derivatives of vitamin D.",

     "abstract": "Here, a new acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AMML) cell line, JIH-3, is reported, and its biological characteristics are described. JIH-3 cells were maintained without any cytokines for 27 months. The JIH-3 cell line showed typical myelomonocytic morphological features. Additionally, it mainly expressed myeloid and monocytic markers (CD13, CD14, CD11b, CD15 and CD33), although it also expressed other antigens such as the markers of T and B lymphocytic lineage as well as stem cell, progenitor cell, and natural killer cell-related antigens (CD4, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD22, CD34, CD38, HLADR, CD16/CD56 and CD56); the expression of these markers, suggested that this cell line was in the early stage of myelomonocytic differentiation. Cytogenetic analysis initially showed a karyotype of 46, XY, del(7) (p1?3p2?2). During the passage period, the cells with this karyotype gradually decreased and were replaced by cells with a 45,XY,dic(4;7)(p11;p11),del(15)(q2?2) karyotype. Chromosome painting showed a deletion in the short arm of chromosome 7 for del(7)(p1?3p2?2) and der(4;7)(p11;p11). The latter had larger deleted segment than the former. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed the dicentric nature of der(4;7), and Multiplex FISH (M-FISH) confirmed that der(4;7) was an unbalanced translocation. A deletion involving the 7p region on dic(4;7)(p11;p11) harbors many genes, including CDC2L5, C7ORF11, C7ORF10 and INHBA. Haploinsufficiency of the genes on 4p, 7p and 15q caused by deletions of 4p, 7p and 15q2?2 that resulted from dic(4;7)(p11;p11) and del(15)(q2?2) may play important roles in leukemogenesis and in the establishment of the JIH-3 cell line. JIH-3 cells did not express multidrug resistance (MDR)-related genes and apoptosis-related genes such as MDR1, multidrug resistance-related protein, lung resistance protein, BCL-2, Bax, GS-\u03c0 or Fax, only P21 expression was detected, which probably leads the MDR indirectly through inhibition of the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK). JIH-3 cells had tumorigenic capacity in nude mice. In conclusion, JIH-3 is a new acute myelomonocytic leukemia cell line. It is from a well-characterized background and provides a new useful tool for the study of leukemia patients with a 7p deletion.",

The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is constitutively activated in MCL and plays a critical role in tumor growth and survival. However, single targeted agent mTOR has limited efficacy in treating MCL. Here, we investigate for the first time potential efficacy of NVP-BEZ235 (BEZ235) in treating MCL by simultaneously targeting Akt and mTOR.In this study, phosphorylated Akt and mTOR level were elevated in tissue samples from MCL patients and in MCL cell lines. We also generated bortezomib-resistant MCL cell lines and found increased phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. Individual inhibition of PI3K or mTOR had limited anti-proliferative effects, whereas dual inhibition with BEZ235 effectively inhibited cell growth. The effect of BEZ235 was synergistic and sensitized the cells to the cytotoxic effects of conventional agents. Furthermore, BEZ235 could overcome acquired resistance to bortezomib in MCL cells and suppress the activated Akt/mTOR pathway. Therefore, these data suggest that the Akt/mTOR pathway plays a key role in the growth and survival of MCL cells and that these proteins may need to be simultaneously targeted for effective treatment of the disease. Our findings suggest that BEZ235 may be an effective agent for the treatment of MCL.",

We identified a BA21 peptide that was specifically reactive with LGL leukemia sera and found significantly elevated antibody reactivity against the same peptide in LGL-BMF sera. This finding of shared seroreactivity in LGL-BMF conditions and LGL leukemia suggests that these diseases might share a common pathogenesis.",

In SOCS1, ET patients showed significantly less methylation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) than healthy controls, and in SOCS3 and PTPN6 such a tendency was shown. However, there were no significant differences in the methylation frequencies between JAK2 wildtype and mutated ET patients. In addition, no correlation was detected between methylation of SOCS and PTPN and any clinical outcome parameters.

This capacity for discrimination creates an opportunity to use oncolytic viruses as ex vivo purging agents of autologous hematopoietic cell grafts in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, the mechanisms by which oncolytic viruses select malignant hematopoietic cells are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how MYXV specifically targets human AML cells. MYXV prevented chloroma formation and bone marrow engraftment of two human AML cell lines, KG-1 and THP-1. The reduction in human leukemia engraftment after ex vivo MYXV treatment was dose-dependent and required a minimum MOI of 3. Both AML cell lines demonstrated MYXV binding to leukemia cell membranes following co-incubation: however, evidence of productive MYXV infection was observed only in THP-1 cells. This observation, that KG-1 can be targeted in vivo even in the absence of in vitro permissive viral infection, contrasts with the current understanding of oncolytic virotherapy, which assumes that virus infection and productive replication is a requirement. Preventing MYXV binding to AML cells with heparin abrogated the purging capacity of MYXV, indicating that binding of infectious virus particles is a necessary step for effective viral oncolysis. Our results challenge the current dogma of oncolytic virotherapy and show that in vitro permissiveness to an oncolytic virus is not necessarily an accurate predictor of oncolytic potency in vivo.",

Several strains of NDV were reported to induce cytolysis to cancerous cell lines. It has prompted much interest as anticancer agent because it can replicate up to 10,000 times better in human cancer cells than in most normal cells. In this study, two NDV strains, viserotropic\u2013velogenic strain AF2240 and lentogenic strain V4-UPM, showed cytolytic activity and apoptosis induction against Mouse myelomoncytic leukemia (WEHI 3B). The cytolytic effects of NDV strains were determined using microtetrazolium (MTT) assay. The cytolytic dose \u2013 fifty percent (CD50) were 2 and 8\u00a0HAU for AF2240 and V4-UPM strains, respectively. Cells treated with NDV strains showed apoptotic features compared to the untreated cells under fluorescence microscope. NDV induced activation of caspase-3 and DNA laddering in agarose gel electrophoresis which confirmed the apoptosis. The anti-leukemic activity of both strains was evaluated on myelomoncytic leukemia BALB/c mice. The results indicated that both NDV strains significantly decreased liver and spleen weights. It also decreased blasts cell percentage in blood, bone marrow and spleen smears of treated mice (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Histopathological studies for spleen and liver confirmed the hematological results of blood and bone marrow. From the results obtained, the exposure to both NDV stains AF2240 and V4-UPM showed similar results for Ara-c.

     "abstract": "Recently, we identified a novel chromosomal rearrangement in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), t(4;8)(q27;q24), which targets homeobox gene ZHX2 at the recurrent breakpoint 8q24. This aberration deletes the far upstream region of ZHX2 and results in silenced transcription pinpointing loss of activatory elements. Here, we have looked for potential binding sites within this deleted region to analyze the transcriptional deregulation of this tumor suppressor gene in B-cell malignancies. SiRNA-mediated knockdown and reporter gene analyses identified two transcription factors, homeodomain protein MSX1 and bZIP protein XBP1, directly regulating ZHX2 expression. Furthermore, MSX1-cofactor histone H1C mediated repression of ZHX2 and showed enhanced expression levels in cell line L-1236. As demonstrated by fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic array analysis, the gene loci of MSX1 at 4p16 and H1C at 6p22 were rearranged in several HL cell lines, correlating with their altered expression activity. The expression of XBP1 was reduced in 6/7 HL cell lines as compared to primary hematopoietic cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate multiple mechanisms decreasing expression of tumor suppressor gene ZHX2 in HL cell lines: loss of enhancing binding sites, reduced expression of activators MSX1 and XBP1, and overexpression of MSX1-corepressor H1C. Moreover, chromosomal deregulations of genes involved in this regulative network highlight their role in development and malignancy of B-cells.",

In our study, MRD was monitored at different time points with both MFC and WT1-RNA quantification in 23 AML patients who did not present specific molecular targets.

Measurement of 25(OH)D was performed by means of a direct, competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay using the DiaSorin LIAISON 25(OH)D TOTAL assay (DiaSorin, Inc., Stillwater, Minnesota). Overall, 41 patients (31.5%) had severe vitamin D insufficiency (<10\u00a0ng/mL), 66 (50.7%) had mild to moderate insufficiency (10\u201324\u00a0ng/mL), and 23 (17.6%) had 25(OH)D levels within the optimal range (25\u201380\u00a0ng/mL), with no relationship with between the season of sample collection and 25(OH)D level (P\u00a0=\u00a00.188).

We examined the effect of a specific GSK-3 inhibitor (SB-415286) on the regulation of leukemic cells proliferation and apoptosis. SB-415286 (40\u00a0\u03bcM) induced cell growth inhibition, \u03b2-catenin stabilization, cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase, cyclin B1 downregulation, and apoptosis in leukemic cell lines KG1a, K562, and CMK. Blocking the death receptor pathway by using a specific inhibitor of caspase-8, did not inhibit SB-415286-induced apoptosis. This indicates that activation of caspase-8 is part of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and occurs downstream of mitochondria membrane potential depolarization mediated by other caspases. Furthermore, we found that depolarization of mitochondria membrane caused by GSK-3 inhibition is regulated by dephosphorylation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and downregulation of Bcl-xL. Thus, inhibition of GSK-3-induced apoptosis of leukemic cells could be an attractive target for treatment of leukemia.",

We found no mutation in the Abl kinase domain of SUP-B15/RI. Furthermore, the detection of cell signaling pathway of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF, NF-\u03baB, JNK and STAT showed the up-regulation of phosphorylation of AKT, mTOR, P70S6K, and RAF, ERK, and MEK, down-regulation of PTEN and 4EBP-1, and no change in other cell signaling pathways in SUP-B15/RI. However, dasatinib and nilotinib showed partial resistance. Interestingly, bortezomib had no resistance. Imatinib combination with rapamycin had synergistic effect on overcoming the resistance. Altogether, over-expression of BCR-ABL1 and mdr1 gene were involved in the resistance mechanisms, and up-regulation of the cell signaling pathways of PI3K/AKT/mTOR, RAS/RAF in SUP-B15/RI cell line may be correlated with them. The SUP-B15/RI cell line was also resistant to the second generation tyrosine kinase, dasatinib, and nilotinib, not bortezomib.

Plasma soluble FasL (sFasL) was detected by ELISA. Fas, FasL and EMPs were evaluated by Confocal microscopy and flow cytometric analysis respectively. Significantly higher levels of sFasL and EMPs were detected in the patients at the time of aGVHD attack. In addition, sFasL exhibited significant elevation but EMPs exhibited simultaneously decrease within the early phase (+21d) after allo-HSCT in pre-aGVHD group compared with non-aGVHD group. At +21d, there was a significant difference of sFasL and EMPs between pre-aGVHD group and non-aGVHD group. Moreover our present study firstly reported that EMPs expressed higher Fas antigen (Fas+-EMPs) in the patients with aGVHD.

We identified 20 signature genes including CTGF, BMP-2, CXCR4 and IL7R, documented to regulate interactions in the bone marrow. We recorded remarkably similar levels of expression in three independent patient cohorts, and found distinct patterns in cytogenetically defined subgroups of pre-B ALL. The canonical pathways that were affected are involved in inter- and intra-cellular communication, regulating signaling within the microenvironment. We tested experimentally whether interaction with stromal cells conferred protection to four drugs used in current ALL therapy, and demonstrated that bone marrow stromal cells significantly influenced resistance to vincristine and cytosine arabinoside. Compounds designed to block the identified cellular interactions within the bone marrow microenvironment are expected to mobilise the leukemic cells and make them more accessible to contemporary antileukemic agents.

The diminished signal represented loss of the ATM gene, which could have been missed were the cases not further investigated. These rare cases highlight the need for careful consideration of the choice of probe and interpretation of unusual signal patterns in FISH screening.

However, the exact role of GJIC in the hematopoietic microenvironment in leukemic cell death and proliferation is not clear. We show here that following transfection with the Cx43 gene, GJIC function was increased between leukemic BMSCs. Furthermore, compared with leukemic cells alone, the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemic cells co-cultured with BMSCs were inhibited, the percentage of G0-phase cells was higher; and expression of p53 increased and bax decreased. However, after co-culturing leukemic cells with Cx43-modified BMSCs, the number of proliferative and spontaneously apoptotic Jurkat cells increased; the percentage of G0-phase cells decreased; the expression of p53 decreased; and bax increased. Compared with Jurkat cells co-cultured with BMSCs and Jurkat cells alone, the sensitivity of leukemic cells co-cultured with Cx43-modified BMSCs to chemotherapeutics increased. Our data suggests that GJIC between leukemia BMSCs is one of the impact factor to the proliferation, apoptosis and drug sensitivity of co-cultured leukemic cells. Up-regulating its function can inhibit the protective effects of leukemic BMSCS and enhance the efficacy of therapies in hematologic malignancies.",

To study the cellular basis of this resistance we have generated a MM cell line displaying enhanced (5\u20136-fold) resistance to bortezomib by serial cultivation of RPMI 8226 cells with increasing concentrations of this drug. Bortezomib-resistant cells (8226/7B) became bigger in size than parental cells and nearly doubled the amount of DNA per cell, evolving from hypotriploidy to near-tetraploidy. 8226/7B displayed lowered Noxa accumulation and reduced caspase-3 activation in response to bortezomib. Resistant 8226/7B cells overexpressed the PSM\u03b25 proteasome subunit, the molecular target of bortezomib, both at the mRNA and protein level. No mutations were detected in the PSM\u03b25 gene. Bortezomib-resistant cells were roughly as sensitive as parental cells to other chemotherapeutic drugs, including doxorubicin, melphalan, vincristine, BMS-214662 and BMS-345541. 8226/7B cells showed partial and high cross-resistance to the proteasome inhibitors epoxomicin and MG-132, respectively. Co-treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) potentiated bortezomib-induced apoptosis in parental RPMI 8226 cells but did not revert bortezomib resistance in 8226/7B cells. Therefore, treatment of bortezomib-refractory myeloma with drugs targeting molecular structures other than proteasome seems to be the more suitable therapeutic strategy to overcome bortezomib resistance.",

PIM1, a serine/threonine kinase, is up-regulated in FLT3-ITD AML and may be involved in FLT3-mediated leukemogenesis. We employed a PIM1 inhibitor, AR00459339 (Array Biopharma Inc.), to investigate the effect of PIM1 inhibition in FLT3-mutant AML. Like FLT3 inhibitors, AR00459339 was preferentially cytotoxic to FLT3-ITD cells, as demonstrated in the MV4-11, Molm-14, and TF/ITD cell lines, as well as 12 FLT3-ITD primary samples. Unlike FLT3 inhibitors, AR00459339 did not suppress phosphorylation of FLT3, but did promote the de-phosphorylation of downstream FLT3 targets, STAT5, AKT, and BAD. Combining AR00459339 with a FLT3 inhibitor resulted in additive to mildly synergistic cytotoxic effects. AR00459339 was cytotoxic to FLT3-ITD samples from patients with secondary resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, suggesting a novel benefit to combining these agents. We conclude that PIM1 appears to be closely associated with FLT3 signaling, and that inhibition of PIM1 may hold therapeutic promise, either as monotherapy, or by overcoming resistance to FLT3 inhibitors.",

However, whereas such early neoplastic conditions have been defined in some detail in lymphoproliferative neoplasms, little is known about minimal lesions preceding the manifestation of an overt myeloid neoplasm, about underlying mechanisms, the clinical course and outcome, and the prognostic significance of such conditions. Members of several groups have recently described two \u2018premalignant\u2019 myeloid conditions, namely idiopathic cytopenia of undetermined significance (ICUS) and idiopathic bone marrow dysplasia of uncertain significance (IDUS). At least in some patients these are neoplastic conditions. Both conditions may progress to an overt myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), but may also progress to another myeloid neoplasm such as acute myeloid leukemia, a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), or a mast cell disorder (mastocytosis). In ICUS the dysplasia is mild and does not fulfill the WHO criteria for MDS but cytopenias can be severe. In IDUS the dysplasia is prominent but cytopenias, if detectable, are mild. In both conditions it is possible that a neoplastic clone has already replaced most or all of normal bone marrow cells when ICUS or IDUS is detected, but evidence to support this possibility is not necessarily available. For both groups of patients we recommend a thorough hematologic follow up because of the potential of disease-manifestation and the unpredictable form and time of progression. In the present review, we discuss current concepts relating to ICUS and IDUS as well as diagnostic approaches and available criteria.",

Furthermore, as an independent prognostic factor, CASP8AP2 expression was correlated to minimal residual disease (MRD), and incorporating it with MRD would help to identify patients at greater risk of bone marrow relapse. We also developed an algorithm comprised of clinical risk and CASP8AP2 expression, which could predict bone marrow relapse more accurately.",

Conventional treatment methods are unsatisfactory, leading to a pattern of regression and remission, and ultimately failure. This pattern suggests that one of the possible strategies for improving outcomes is continuous therapy to maintain suppression of the surviving tumor cells. Optimal management of MM requires potent agents and modalities with direct tumoricidal activity, which can also provide continuous suppression of the residual tumor to prevent disease relapse. Immunomodulatory agents exert immunomodulatory and tumoricidal effects, and cause disruption of stromal cell support from the bone marrow microenvironment. Therefore continuous therapy with immumomodulatory agents may be able to provide both tumor reduction and tumor suppression, enabling physicians to consider the possibility of incorporating continuous therapy into the treatment paradigm of patients with MM.",

CV-AEs had no relationship with patient characteristics (including older age). A significant relationship was found only with a higher anagrelide induction dose.In the absence of any agreed protocol, a cardiovascular instrumental evaluation (CV-IE) was performed in 102 (44%) patients before commencement of anagrelide (with higher rate after the anagrelide/Xagrid EMA approval of 2004), and in 84 (36%) patients during treatment. Patients with and without CV-IEs, who resulted completely balanced for all their characteristics, did not significantly differ in the occurrence of CV-AEs.In conclusion, this study on ET patients treated with anagrelide shows that CV-AEs, equally distributed in younger and older subjects, were mostly mild and easily manageable, allowing safe treatment continuation in the majority of cases. Moreover, routinely performing a CV-IE did not appear to anticipate the occurrence of CV-AEs.",

Hence, novel therapeutic agents that are capable of distinct and diverse mechanisms of activity in, now resistant, leukemia cells are of great interest. We have investigated the opioid agonist methadone for its anti-leukemic activity, initially reported in studies with cell lines derived from adult patients. Our findings show that, compared to normal cells, methadone has enhanced cytotoxicity against specimens and cell lines established from refractory childhood leukemia. In addition, methadone's activity synergized with that of the anti-Bcl-2 agent ABT-737 and was characterized by the induction of distinct changes in tumor cell mitochondria. Data presented also identify biological correlates and a potential mechanism for methadone activity by its effects on Mcl-1 and other members of the apoptosis cascade.

     "publication date": "11-2011",
     "abstract": "This paper speculates on the role of infection in modifying a young child's risk of promoting precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). It is suggested that the heat shock instigated by infections, particularly in infancy, stimulates Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines and an apoptosis-inhibitory environment. This infective stress also increases the number of cooperating oncogenic mutations in pre-leukemic cells, especially if the primary adaptive immune response is delayed. The glucocorticoid release that follows leads to acute thymic involution, a decline in antitumor immunity, and maturation arrest of B-lymphocytes. The infective lymphoid recovery hypothesis addresses an apparent contradiction\u2013that a non-hygienic environment primes the adaptive immune response and is protective against childhood ALL, while multiple infections occurring later increase the risk of childhood ALL. In affluent (compared to less-affluent) societies, the characteristic ALL incidence peak in early childhood, and the shortened time to diagnosis, arise from surviving recurrent infections and the accumulated loss and recovery of lymphoid tissue. Evidence supporting the hypothesis, such as the role of lymphoid tissue reconstitution cytokines that stimulate proliferation stress on B-cell progenitors, comes from the study of children with congenital syndromes that are susceptible to leukemia.",

Instead, surrogates that may be measured by flow cytometry have been sought. Measurements of the expression of CD38 and ZAP-70 have been the most popular assays for prognosis although both are in their own ways unsatisfactory. Many other candidates have emerged, but none has been universally endorsed.As the assay for IGHV mutations has been standardized the level of difficulty has diminished and as greater numbers of cases have been assessed it has become clear that there is even more information to be gathered from the study of the sequence of IGHV genes. It has been recognized that stereotypy within CLL is associated with more specific clinical features than mere longevity and an even greater heterogeneity has been revealed. It seems clear that the search for surrogacy is futile and that IGHV mutational status should become a routine investigation in CLL.",

Early clinical trials showed erythroid responses in no more than 15\u201325% of patients. In the last decade, a better selection of MDS patients suitable for a therapeutic challenge with rHEPO, alone or in combination with G-CSF, allowed for an increased response-rate, averaging around 40%. More recently, an even higher percentage of responses have been obtained using higher-doses of rHEPO (up to 80,000\u00a0IU/weekly) in lower-risk MDS patients. This treatment however, especially at such high doses, is costly and not easily affordable for prolonged periods.

Higher response-rates to rHEPO were related with both lower IPSS and particularly WPSS scores. Treatment was safe, and only 1 patient had to discontinue the treatment because of unmanageable side-effects. Among the 36 responders, 28 (77%) maintained the response after a median follow-up of 46 months.Our data indicate that standard doses of rHEPO are at least as effective as higher-doses for correcting anemia in lower-risk MDS patients; in this clinical scenario, this schedule allows for a consistent reduction of costs without precluding the achievement of a durable erythroid response.",

In general, the greatest level of synergy was observed with LtxA and etoposide or imatinib.

This process is regulated by soluble cytokines binding to a ligand specific cell surface receptor on a precursor cell. Key to signal transduction are tyrosine kinase proteins which can be divided into two sub families, the receptor protein tyrosine kinases which are transmembrane receptors and retain an intact catalytic kinase domain and the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases which bind to cytokine receptors. Abnormalities of tyrosine kinase proteins are well recognised in myeloid malignancies, mutation in the cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase JAK2 (V617F) is key in the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms, and translocations involving ABL key in the development of chronic myeloid leukaemia. However tyrosine kinase mutations are increasingly recognised to play a role in the pathogenesis of a wider range of haematological cancers. This review focuses on the role of deregulated tyrosine kinase genes either as part of novel fusion proteins involving FGFR1, PDGFR\u03b1, PDGFR\u03b2, JAK2 and ABL, or as a consequence of point mutation in JAK1 or JAK2 in the development of precursor T and B lymphoid malignancies or mixed myeloid/lymphoid disorders.

Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) 6 has been implicated in cell adhesion, cellular invasiveness, angiogenesis, and inflammation, which are all key processes in the pathophysiology of PMF. Accordingly, CEACAMs may play an important role in these processes in patients with myelofibrosis as well. Using a genome-wide approach, several genes of the CEACAM family were found to be deregulated in patients with PMF and related myeloproliferative neoplasms (n\u00a0=\u00a069).

A defined combination of antibodies discriminates between normal B cells and CLL cells (coexpression of CD5, CD19, and CD23). The receptor tyrosine-like orphan receptor one (ROR1) is an embryonic glycoprotein involved in several developmental processes. It was shown to be highly and specifically expressed on circulating B lymphoma cells, but not on normal B cells. Here, we examined the potential of ROR1 as a diagnostic marker in initial and follow-up diagnostics of patients with CLL. 105 untreated and 72 treated patients, as well as healthy volunteers were examined using flow cytometry assays. Furthermore, we examined 10 patients with various B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas (B-NHL). ROR1 was detected using a directly labeled antibody. We detected uniformly high ROR1 expression levels in all CLL samples. In marked contrast, only low or absent ROR1 expression levels were found on B cells from healthy donors. ROR1 expression in CLL patients was not influenced by various treatments. Taken together, ROR1 may be used as a diagnostic marker for CLL. As it is the only antigen which can exclusively be detected on neoplastic B cells it may greatly increase both, specificity as well as sensitivity, in lymphoma diagnostics.",

AML blasts reacted positive for PTPIP51 protein encompassing the C-terminal sequence. Healthy bone marrow displayed an exclusive staining for the N-terminal containing form of PTPIP51. Moreover, PTPIP51 protein was highly phosphorylated at its tyrosine 176 residue. Acquired confocal images of AML cells displayed an absence of PTP1B and revealed a co-localization of PTPIP51 and Lyn. Duolink proximity ligation assays (DPLA) corroborated an interaction for PTPIP51 with Lyn and c-Src. In AML blasts rarely an interaction of PTPIP51 with PTP1B and Raf-1 was seen. Furthermore, DPLA signals were also obtained for PTPIP51 and c-Kit in AML cells. Therefore, PTPIP51 was identified as a new signal molecule of the c-Kit signaling pathway.

A small subset of SM patients with KITD816V mutation require cytoreductive therapy. In these patients, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been actively investigated over the last decade because of codon 816 KIT mutations causing constitutive activation of tyrosine kinase activity of the molecule. The main question has been whether the success story with imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), another disease associated with a constitutively active tyrosine kinase, could be mimicked in mastocytosis. However, the results from various TKIs in SM with KITD816V mutation have been disappointing to date. Only a few of the TKIs sufficiently block KITD816V activity and have shown promising clinical results. The data from these studies indicate that, apart from KITD816V, other kinase targets and target pathways may play a role in disease evolution and progression, especially in patients with SM with an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell lineage disease (SM-AHNMD). Imatinib is effective in patients with increased mast cells and eosinophils associated with FIP1L1/PDGFRA+ (e.g., myeloid neoplasm with eosinophilia and rearrangement of PDGFRA) or rare patients with SM associated with KIT mutations outside of exon 17. This review will focus on the KIT receptor, KIT mutations, and the effects of the mutations in SM.

     "abstract": "T cell immune dysfunction has an important role in the profound immunosupression that characterizes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Improper polarization of T cells has been proposed as one of the mechanism involved. Mounting data implicates chromatin regulation, namely promoter methylation, in the plasticity of na\u00efve human T cells. Recent in vitro evidence indicates that this plasticity may be phenotypically altered by using methylation inhibitors which are approved for clinical use in certain types of cancer. These results beg the question: can the ineffective polarization of T lymphocytes in the context of CLL be effectively modulated using methylation inhibitors in a sustainable therapeutic fashion? To answer this question our laboratory has studied the effects of 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5A2) in helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes from healthy donors and CLL patients in well characterized molecular and epigenetic signaling pathways involved in effective polarization. Moreover, we sought to investigate the consequences of methylation inhibitor treatment on lymphocyte survival, activation intensity, and na\u00efve cell polarization. Our data indicates that 5A2 treatment can repolarize Th2 cells to effectively secrete interferon gamma, signal via T-bet, and achieve demethylation of critical Th1 specific promoters. Moreover, we demonstrate that 5A2 can force Th1 polarization of na\u00efve T cells despite a strong IL-4 stimuli and a lack of IL-12. In conclusion our data seeks to define a modality in which improper or ineffective T cell polarization can be altered by 5AZA and could be incorporated in future therapeutic interventions.",

Recent studies have demonstrated that up-regulation of FGFR3 promotes cell survival, growth and drug resistance in malignant plasma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, inhibition of FGFR3 signalling is potential target for the chemotherapeutic intervention in t(4;14) MM.Small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (PD173074, sunitinib (SU-11248), vandetanib (ZD6474) and vatalanib (PTK-787)) with varying degrees of inhibitory activity and selectivity against FGFR, were assessed in Ba/f3 cells expressing ZNF198-FGFR1 and MM cell lines. Cell viability, FGFR3 and ZNF198-FGFR1 phosphorylation and apoptosis were evaluated by growth inhibition assays, immunoblotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis, respectively. An in vivo study was performed with sunitinib in t(4;14)-positive and t(4;14)-negative human MM tumour xenograft models.PD173074 and sunitinib differentially inhibited the growth of Ba/f3 cells expressing ZNF198-FGFR1 (GI50\u00a0=\u00a010\u00a0nM and 730\u00a0nM, versus GI50 >1\u00a0\u03bcM and 2.7\u00a0\u03bcM for parental cells; p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and t(4;14) positive MM cell lines (GI50\u00a0=\u00a04\u201310\u00a0\u03bcM and 1\u20133\u00a0\u03bcM, versus GI50\u00a0=\u00a014\u201315\u00a0\u03bcM and 4\u20135\u00a0\u03bcM for t(4;14) negative MM cells; p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.002). In addition, both PD173074 and sunitinib inhibited the activation of FGFR3 in t(4;14)-positive MM cells. PD173074 and sunitinib induced an apoptotic response in a concentration and time-dependent manner in a t(4;14)-positive (PD174073 and sunitinib) but not a t(4;14)-negative MM cell line (sunitinib only); however, in in vivo tumours derived from the same cell lines, sunitinib was only active in the t(4;14)-negative model.These data demonstrate that PD173074 and sunitinib are inhibitors of FGFR3 in MM cell lines, and that sunitinib has in vivo activity in a human MM tumour xenograft model. However, caution should be exercised in using the t(4;14) translocation as a predictive biomarker for patient selection in clinical trials with sunitinib.",

The present study aimed at analyzing the relevance of agmatine homeostasis in pathophysiology of human leukemia. Proliferation of the human leukemia cells HMC-1 and HL-60 was determined in the absence or presence of agmatine. Apoptosis and cell cycle distribution was investigated by determination of caspase-3 activity and/or flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide. Expression analysis was performed by qPCR and by a microarray genechip. Exogenous agmatine inhibited proliferation of both HMC-1 and HL-60 cells. The antiproliferative effect was due to interference of agmatine with the cell cycle with no evident signs of apoptosis. Comparative analysis of expression of mRNA in untreated HMC-1 cells and in non-leukemic human mast cells revealed a much lower expression of agmatinase and diamine oxidase in HMC-1 cells indicating a significantly reduced agmatine catabolism in the leukemic cells. At the mRNA level, inhibition of proliferation of both cell lines by agmatine was associated with cell type-specific alterations of the expression of enzymes of the polyamine pathway. The present results point to a significant role of agmatine homeostasis in the (patho)physiology of cell proliferation of leukemic cells, at least in HMC-1 and HL-60 cells, that may serve as a potential target for an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of human leukemia.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with JMML and CMV infection displayed an elevated proportion of p-STAT5 cells after low-dose GM-CSF stimulation when compared with cells from normal individuals.

To elucidate possible signaling pathway in it, gene expression profiles of peripheral lymphocytes were compared between samples 24\u00a0h after each 4.5\u00a0Gy total body irradiation treatment (total 9\u00a0Gy) from 4 adult ALL patients. 478 significant expressed genes and three unique patterns were identified. Of these, a dominant progressively repressed expression of genes involved in ubiquitin-dependent process and repressed expression only at 9\u00a0Gy of genes involved in allograft rejection and graft-versus-host disease pathways were observed. The results suggest these pathways may play important roles for subsequent transplantation.",

The FCSS scores were significantly higher in patients with MDS than those in the non-MDS control. A flow score of 2 or more allowed for a specificity of 100% with 75% sensitivity in distinguishing these two groups. The FCSS scores correlated directly with validated prognostic systems including WHO classification, International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS), WHO-adjusted prognostic scoring system (WPSS) and transfusion dependency. The median survival of conventionally treated MDS patients was directly related to FCSS group; severe: 6\u00a0months; moderate: 19\u00a0months and normal/mild: not reached. The multivariate analyses suggested the FCSS risk categories were an independent prognostic factor after adjustment for sex, age (above or below 70\u00a0years), IPSS or WPSS risk categories.

This study demonstrates that abnormally high levels of Ann II expression in APL cells increase the production of plasmin. Hyperfibrinolysis could be corrected by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or ATRA plus arsenic trioxide therapy in patients with APL. SiRNA targetting Ann II caused a decrease in tPA-dependent plasmin generation, while Ann II cDNA transfectant stimulated plasmin production. These results suggest that Ann II play an important role in hyperfibrinolysis in APL.",

Moreover, down-regulation of p21waf1 in MV4-11 R248W cells by a small interfering RNA blunted activation of caspase 3 after exposure to the combination of 5-AzadC and MS-275, indicating the role of p21waf1 to activate caspase 3.Taken together, TP53-independent up-regulation of p21waf1 activates caspase 3 and down-regulates Mcl-1 in AML cells.

We identified various degrees of down-regulation of miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-29b, miR-181a and miR-181b in CLL mononuclear cells. Moreover, we have identified miR-29b and miR-181a/b expression significantly correlated with IGHV mutational status. Transcript levels of predicted target genes BCL-2 and TCL-1 were also determined, and the expression levels were significantly upregulated in CLL patients compared with normal controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Higher expression of TCL-1 was significantly correlated with aggressive disease features. In addition, an inverse correlation was observed in the CLL samples we examined between miRNAs (miR-16-1, miR-181a, miR-181b) and BCL-2 level; furthermore, an inverse correlation was also observed between miRNAs (miR-16-1, miR-181a, miR-181b) and TCL-1, which suggest that these miRNAs may implicate in negatively regulating target mRNA at transcriptional level.

Four membrane-bound receptors have been identified. TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R2 contain a functional death domain; TRAIL-R3 and TRAIL-R4 lack a functional death domain and function as decoy receptors. Flow-cytometric analysis revealed that acute myeloid leukemic (AML) blasts expressed significantly more pro-apoptotic receptors compared to normal blasts. However, about 20% of AML patients highly expressed decoy receptor TRAIL-R3, which was strongly correlated to a shortened overall survival. TRAIL-R3 expression was also high on CD34+/CD38\u2212 cells, the compartment that harbors the leukemia initiating stem cell. Expression levels of pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors were not correlated to the susceptibility for soluble TRAIL, which was generally low (mean level of cell death induction 14%). Cell death could be enhanced by down-modulation of TRAIL-R3, confirming its decoy function on AML blasts. Bypassing of TRAIL-R3 by treatment with antibodies directly targeting TRAIL-R2 resulted in higher rates of induced cell death (max. 80%).In conclusion, AML blasts do express pro-apoptotic TRAIL receptors. However, co-expression of decoy receptor TRAIL-R3 results in significant shortened overall survival. AML blasts could be targeted by anti-TRAIL-R2 antibodies, yielding a new therapeutic option for AML patients.",

However, very few of the current group play a clearly defined role in the pathology of this disease and even fewer represent a tractable therapeutic target. One such marker that fulfils both of these criteria is the integrin CD49d. This molecule been implicated in the capacity of CLL cells to migrate into lymphoid tissues and there is a CD49d blocking antibody, Natalizumab, currently in clinical trials. Here we carried out the largest multi-centre evaluation of CD49d as a prognostic marker in 652 primary CLL samples. We confirm that CD49d is predictive for time to first treatment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and increases the prognostic power of CD38, ZAP-70 and IGHV gene mutation status in concordant cases.

In contrast to previous studies, we showed no correlation between CD49d expression and in vitro resistance to fludarabine in liquid cultures (P\u00a0=\u00a00.28) but CD49dhi cells were significantly more resistant than CD49dlo cells when assays were carried out on fibronectin-coated plates (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Furthermore, we showed for the first time that the expression of CD49d is strongly associated with expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 suggesting a co-ordinated role for these molecules in the trafficking of CLL cells to the lymphoid tissues. Taken together, our data support the introduction of CD49d into routine immunophenotyping panels for CLL and indicate that the therapeutic targeting of this molecule may prove useful in this disease.",

This phenomenon has been recently described in MDS treated with the new oral chelator deferasirox.Here we briefly review the literature about this phenomenon and discuss the possible biological mechanisms underlying hematologic effects of deferasirox in MDS, starting from a new paradigmatic case in whom both hemoglobin level and platelet count improved, inducing transfusion-independence, soon after starting the treatment with deferasirox.",

     "abstract": "The TARGET system is an online database that can be easily accessed by physicians. The registration of one's own chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients in the TARGET system makes it possible to share experiences among physicians, and, thus, may facilitate appropriate treatment for patients. Patients were registered in the TARGET system from October 2003 to March 2010 in Japan. A total of 1236 patients from 176 hospitals were registered in Japan. We analyzed data from 639 CML chronic phase patients not receiving prior therapy registered in this system. After 90 months follow-up, high survival rates were demonstrated for imatinib-treated newly diagnosed CML patients, with event-free survival (EFS), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) rates of 79.1, 94.8, and 95.1%, respectively. A landmark analysis of 296 patients who showed a complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at 12 months after the initiation of imatinib treatment revealed that, at 90 months, 99% of patients (95% CI, 98\u2013100) had not progressed to accelerated phase (AP) or blastic crisis (BC). The patients showing a CCyR and a reduction of at least 3\u00a0log levels of BCR-ABL transcripts after 18 months of treatment had an estimated survival rate without CML progression of 100% at 84 months. The probability of achieving undetectable BCR-ABL in patients by 72 months with an major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months was 86.5%, compared with 64.7% for those without an MMR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). There were no new safety issues. In summary, based on this 7-year TARGET analysis, imatinib showed a continual clinical benefit as first-line therapy for newly diagnosed CML. The TARGET system may represent a more practical and general feature compared with the IRIS study.",

Our population had significantly less patients with prior history of polycythemia vera (PV), shorter time from MPN diagnosis to blastic transformation, <3 prior therapies, more frequent use of hydroxyurea and erythropoietin and less frequent use of alkylating agents. Interestingly, the overall survival of the two cohorts from the time of blastic transformation was similar. We therefore looked at the outcome of the entire cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0112). Patients with prior history of essential thrombocythemia survived longer than patients with prior history of myelofibrosis or PV. Further, patients with <3 prior therapies, those who lacked complex karyotype and those <60 year old at MPN diagnosis had significantly longer survival. Among the PRCI population, 20/23 patients underwent induction treatment with cytarabine and an anthracycline containing regimens; 12 achieved remission and their overall survival was significantly longer than those who did not. Three patients underwent an allogeneic transplantation and their survival was significantly longer than those who did not. Patients with <3 prior therapies, those who lack complex karyotype and those <60 at MPN diagnosis have longer survival following blastic transformation.

The T-ALL cases featured even higher methylation levels (median: 20%) with a strong variation of values of up to 85% methylation.

As important epigenetic effector mechanisms, histone deacetylases (HDAC) have emerged as potential therapeutic targets. However, the patterns of HDAC1 localization and the role of HDACs in leukemia pathogenesis remain to be elucidated.Using ChIP-Chip analyses we analyzed HDAC1 deposition patterns at more than 10,000 gene promoters in a large cohort of leukemia patients and CD34+ controls.HDAC1 binding was significantly increased in AML blasts compared to CD34+ progenitor cells at 130 gene promoters whereas decreased binding was observed at 66 gene promoters. Distinct HDAC1 binding patterns occurred in AML subtypes with balanced translocations t(15;17), t(8;21) and inv(16). In addition, a more generalized signature was established, that revealed an AML specific pattern of HDAC1 distribution. Many of the HDAC1-binding altered promoters regulate genes involved in hematopoiesis, transcriptional regulation and signal transduction. HDAC1 binding patterns were associated with patients\u2019 event free survival. This is the first study to determine HDAC1 modification patterns in a large number of AML and ALL specimens. Our findings suggest that dyslocalization of HDAC1 is a common feature in AML. Importantly, HDAC1 modifications possess prognostic power for patient survival.

In diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), p16INK4a methylation has been associated with advanced disease stage and higher IPI. The prognostic impact of p16INK4a methylation in DLBCL remains unclear; however, it has been suggested to correlate with inferior outcome. To further investigate the clinical impact of p16INK4a methylation in DLBCL, promoter methylation of this gene was assessed quantitatively by pyrosequencing. Forty-two of 113 (37%) DLBCL patients with methylation level above 5% were categorized as methylated and subsequently divided into low, intermediate and high methylation categories. Overall, no association was shown between the extent of p16INK4a methylation and patients\u2019 clinical characteristics, except disease stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049). Moreover, we could not reveal any impact of p16INK4a methylation on lymphoma-specific survival. Although >25% of p16INK4a methylation correlated with a better progression-free survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.048) in patients <65 years old, the significance of this finding, if any, needs to be further investigated. In conclusion, our finding questions the role of p16INK4a promoter methylation as a negative prognostic factor in DLBCL.",

Herein we demonstrated that telomere shortening is a global phenomenon in PhnegMPN's, irrespective of disease phenotype, treatment administration and JAK2V617F mutational status but the presence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities further affects them. Consistent with the above finding, TA was upregulated in CD34+ haemopoietic progenitors from almost all PhnegMPN subgroups compared to healthy donors.

Here we explored the impact of immunophenotypic markers along with NPM1 mutations and clinical features on the outcome of 133 FLT3-ITD negative NK-AML patients.

Methods: 95 patients with ATLL seen at our institution between 1987 and 2008 were included. Clinical data were compared, according to ATLL variant, using the Mann\u2013Whitney and the Chi-square tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates compared using the log-rank test and Cox proportional-hazard test were used for the univariate and multivariate analysis, respectively. Results: Median age was 61 years with male-to-female ratio of 1.07:1. Patients with acute ATLL were more likely to present with bone marrow, liver and spleen involvement, higher \u03b22-microglobulin and lower albumin levels. Poor performance status, high IPI score, presence of B symptoms, high LDH and low albumin levels were associated with a worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL. High LDH, high \u03b22-microglobulin and high PIT score were associated with worse survival in acute ATLL. In the multivariate analysis, low albumin level and presence of B symptoms were independent factors for worse survival in lymphomatous ATLL, and high \u03b22-microglobulin level was independent factor for worse survival in acute ATLL. Conclusions: Aggressive ATLL variants have a distinct, almost mutually exclusive profile of prognostic factors.",

In summary, del(11)q occurring in a non-complex karyotype is predominantly associated with primary MDS, lack of cryptic MLL rearrangements, and shows characteristic clinicopathological features.

Such a function however is lost during malignant transformation and CLL cells are well known for their inability to process and present antigens to the T-cell arm of the immune system. Instead, malignant CLL cells elicit a vast array of immune regulatory mechanisms conducive to T-cell dysfunction and immunosuppression. Previously, we have shown that treatment of CLL cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine unleashed target antigen expression. Here we show for the first time that combining two epigenetic modifiers, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine and the histone deacetylase inhibitor LAQ824 effectively restores the immunogenicity of CLL cell lines as well as primary cells obtained from CLL patients. Indeed, such a combination induces the expression of novel and highly antigenic cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) and costimulatory molecules. These changes facilitate the formation of robust supramolecular activation complexes (SMAC) between CLL cells and responder T-cells leading to intracellular signaling, lytic granule mobilization, and polarization of functional and relevant T-cell responses. This cascade of T-cell activating events triggered by CLL cells with restored APC function, points to combined epigenetic modifier treatment as a potential immunotherapeutic strategy for CLL patients.",

     "abstract": "Recent data suggest that proper assessment of comorbidities is useful to predict the outcome of MDS patients receiving allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, the results obtained in this highly selected subset of patients cannot be applied to the whole MDS population. We evaluated the impact of comorbidities in 418 consecutive MDS patients diagnosed at our institute from 1992 to 2005. All patients were classified according to WHO criteria and all received only conservative and supportive treatment. One or more comorbidities were detected in 390 patients (93%) at the time of diagnosis, with a higher incidence in older patients. Cardiac diseases were the most frequent comorbidities (30%) while diabetes and correlated adverse events were the second cause of comorbidity (20%). We applied 3 comorbidity prognostic scores (CCI, HCT-CI and a MDS-CI score proposed by Della Porta et al.). According to CCI score, 253 patients had a score 0, 111 patients had a score 1 and 54 patients had a score >2. According to HCT-CI, 209 patients had a score 0, 105 patients had a score 1 and 106 patients had a score >2. With MDS-CI score, 288 patients had a score 0 and 129 patients had a score >1. We found a significant correlation between survival and stratification according to CCI and MDS-CI scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01 and 0.02, respectively), but not according to HCT-CI score. The number of comorbidities as evaluated according to CCI was directly correlated to the development of RBC transfusion-dependency and was associated to a significantly higher risk of death not related to leukemic evolution (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.12, p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.001). Conversely, higher risk of non-leukemic death did not correlate with higher transfusional requirement according to HCT-CI and MDS-CI scores (p\u00a0=\u00a00.3 and 0.43, respectively). As suggested by Della Porta et al., also in our experience the presence of cardiac, liver, renal, pulmonary diseases and solid tumours was found to independently affect the risk of death in a multivariable Cox regression analysis (p values from <0.01 to 0.004). In conclusion, assessment of comorbidities at diagnosis in MDS patients may improve the ability of therapeutic decisions.",

NPM-positive patients usually show a normal karyotype, a peculiar morphologic appearance with frequent monocytic traits and good prognosis in the absence of an associated FLT3 mutation. This report describes the immunophenotypic and genetic characteristics of a consecutive series of NPM-mutated de novo AML patients enroled in the CETLAM trial.Eighty-three patients were included in the study. Complete immunophenotype was obtained using multiparametric flow cytometry. Associated genetic lesions (FLT3, MLL, CEBPA and WT1 mutations) were studied by standardized methods. Real-time PCR was employed to assess the minimal residual status.The most common pattern was CD34-CD15+ and HLA-DR+. Small CD34 populations with immunophenotypic aberrations (CD15 and CD19 coexpression, abnormal SSC) were detected even in CD34 negative samples. Nearly all cases expressed CD33 (strong positivity), CD13 and CD117, and all were CD123+ .The stem cell marker CD110 was also positive in most cases. Biologic parameters such as a high percentage of intermediate CD45+ (blast gate) (>75% nucleated cells), CD123+ and FLT3-ITD mutations were associated with a poor outcome. Quantitative PCR positivity had no prognostic impact either after induction or at the end of chemotherapy. Only PCR positivity (greater than 10 copies) detected in patients in haematological remission was associated with an increased relapse rate.Further studies are required to determine whether the degree of leukemic stem cell expansion (CD45\u00a0+\u00a0CD123\u00a0+\u00a0cells) increases the risk of acquisition of FLT3-ITD and/or provides selective advantages.",

     "abstract": "Loss of function mutations in CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) have been identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and bi-allelic (double) CEBPA mutations are associated with improved prognosis in cases of cytogenetically normal-AML. In a subset of AML patients lacking CEBPA mutations, core promotor methylation of CEBPA has been described and is associated with a gene expression profile similar to the mutated cases including the expression of T cell associated genes such as CD7. However, the overall incidence and pattern of CEBPA mutations and core promoter methylation has not been thoroughly explored in a larger subset of AML with expression of CD7. Here we describe a simple and clinically deployable CEBPA promoter methylation test and the results of combined testing for CEBPA mutations and promoter methylation in 102 cases of AML, including 43 CD7+ cases. Overall, there were 5 methylated cases, 6 cases with double mutations, and 3 cases with single mutations. Significantly, 10 of 43 CD7+ cases (23%) had either methylated or double-mutated CEBPA. The CD7+ subset included all 5 methylated cases and 5 of the 6 cases with double mutations. All 3 cases with single mutations were CD7\u2212. No case exhibited both hypermethylation and mutations. We find that promoter methylation accounts for half of those CD7+ cases with CEBPA dysregulating abnormalities. Furthermore, methylated cases and those with bi-allelic CEBPA mutations have similar phenotypic features including expression of CD7 and lack of co-incident NPM1 mutations. Our study suggests that methylation testing may be as important as mutation testing for identifying AML cases with CEBPA dysregulation and may be indicated in the routine prognostic workup of AML.",

Fully differentiated cells acquire the adherent phenotype and exhibit various properties typical of macrophages. However, in spite of a great deal of research devoted to the U937 cellular model, the molecular basis of biological processes involved in the monocyte/macrophage differentiation remains unclear. The present study has been undertaken to contribute to this knowledge, in order to identify proteomic-based differentiation pattern for the U937 cells exposed to TPA.Present results have highlighted that the U937 cell differentiation is correlated with a significant proteomic modulation, corresponding to about 30% of the identified proteins, including both over- and down-regulated proteins. Negative modulation regarded proteins involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and in metabolic processes. Proteins appearing incremented in macrophagic phenotype include calcium- and phospholipid-binding proteins and several proteins related to the phagocytic activity.Conclusively, we suggest that this new set of differentially expressed proteins may represent meaningful myelo-monocytic differentiation markers to be applied to the study of several haematological diseases.",

Only 3 (1.1%) of the newly diagnosed patients in our cohort thereby carried TP53 mutations without 17p-deletion, a frequency that is much lower than previous reports on referral cohorts (3\u20136%). Our findings imply that TP53 mutations are rare at CLL onset and instead may arise during disease progression.",

Since aberrant DNA methylation plays an important role in leukemogenesis of ALL, it can be targeted by 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR), a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation. 5-AZA-CdR is a prodrug that is activated by deoxycytidine kinase (DCK). Leukemic cells lacking DCK are drug-resistant. In a previous phase I study, we reported that 5-AZA-CdR could induce remissions in ALL. However, some patients developed drug-resistance due to deficiency in DCK. These observations aroused our interest in 3-deazauridine (3-DU), a CTP synthetase inhibitor that is effective against leukemic cells deficient in DCK. In this report, we observed that 3-DU enhanced the in vitro antineoplastic action of 5-AZA-CdR on human leukemic cells by increasing its incorporation into DNA. Using an optimized dose-schedule we showed that this combination could cure some mice bearing L1210 leukemia, even in the presence of a subpopulation of drug-resistant (L1210/ARA-C) leukemic cells lacking DCK. 3-DU alone also cured some mice with L1210/ARA-C leukemia. In a pilot study on 3 relapsed patients with advanced ALL, the combination of 5-AZA-CdR and 3-DU produced a marked reduction in leukemic blasts, confirming our preclinical observations. Furthermore, after several treatments with these agents all three patients developed drug-resistance to 5-AZA-CdR as determined by an in vitro drug sensitivity test. In two patients we showed by enzymatic analysis that the drug-resistance was due to deficiency in DCK. Our preclinical and clinical results provide a strong rationale to further investigate the combination of 5-AZA-CdR and 3-DU for the treatment of advanced ALL.",

Certain immunophenotypes (low CD11b, high HLA-Dr, CD34, CD13 and CD45), clonal granulocytes, multiple chromosomal abnormalities, chromosomal instability, short telomeres and high telomerase activity were also reported as PPF. Studies of apoptosis identified Bcl-2 expression and high caspase 3 as PPF, while the reports on survivin expression have been confusing.Recent exciting data suggest that methylation of p15 INK4b and of CTNNA1 (in 5q\u2212), high level of methylation of other genes, absence of the TET2 mutation, down regulation of the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1), mutation of the polycomb-associated gene ASXL1 and a specific 6-gene signature in gene expression profiling \u2013 are all associated with poor prognosis in MDS.Do we have data suggesting a different treatment for \u201clow risk\u201d MDS patients displaying PPF? Two teams, the combined Nordic-Italian and the GFM groups have reported an improved survival with ESAs. The GFM has achieved prolonged survival with iron chelation. Recently, encouraging data with survival advantage in azacitidine-treated patients have been published, including a few INT-I patients. Finally, data suggest that low/INT-I MDS patients who undergo stem cell transplantation (SCT0 do better than INT-II/high risk patients).In summary, some patients, classified as \u201clow risk MDS\u201d carry PPF. An appropriate therapeutic approach is indicated. Future updated classifications and prospective trials may lead to a better outcome.",

SFRP1 has been observed to be transcriptionally down-regulated due to hypermethylation in acute and chronic leukaemia, but so far not in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Moreover, it has been shown that the epigenetic inactivation of SFRP1 correlates with an overexpression of the Wnt receptor Frizzled 3 (Fzd3) in acute leukaemia. Using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we examined mRNA expression of SFRP1 and Fzd3 in bone marrow cells derived from 121 patients with different risk types of MDS, acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We employed pyrosequencing to quantify promoter DNA methylation in MDS and acute leukaemia. We detected significant lower mRNA transcription of SFRP1 in MDS compared to healthy individuals. However, DNA sequence mutations or frequent elevated DNA methylation levels of the SFRP1 promoter could not be observed in MDS but in AML and ALL as previously reported. The expression levels of Fzd3 were up-regulated in both acute leukaemia and MDS. Our data show a significant transcriptional down-regulation of SFRP1 as a common event in AML, ALL and \u2013 as demonstrated for the first time \u2013 in MDS. An inactivation of SFRP1 and the transcriptional up-regulation of Fzd3 seem to be associated with an activation of the Wnt signalling pathway in these haematopoietic diseases.",

To investigate the potential relationship between expression of ZNF300 and the progression of leukemia development and hematopoietic differentiation, we cloned and characterized the putative human ZNF300 gene promoter and identified its transcription start sites (TSSs). Deletion and mutagenesis analysis demonstrated that a myeloid-specific transcription factor PU.1 binding site was responsible for myeloid-specific regulation of ZNF300 promoter activity. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that PU.1 bound to the PU.1 binding site within ZNF300 promoter region in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of PU.1 elevated ZNF300 promoter activity, whereas silencing of PU.1 expression significantly reduced the activity in myeloid-derived HL-60 cell but not in T-cell Jurkat. In vitro induced HL-60 cells into CD11b expressing cells by DMSO demonstrated that ZNF300 was upregulated along with upregulation of PU.1 expression.

Expression of tumor-restricted antigens was further examined in 60 CML patients and humoral immune responses against 15 CT antigens were screened by ELISA.In untreated cell lines we detected the expression of 17 CT antigens that were absent from normal BM.

The aim of the study is to emphasize for the first time the characteristics of this group of age in Romania, a non-Western European country. The cases belonging to the group of age under 50 years were extracted from the database of the MDS Registry of the Hematological Department, Fundeni Clinical Institute, Bucharest, Romania, comprising 403 primary adult cases collected between 1982 and 2004. The registration form, using the FAB classification, was kindly provided by MDS Foundation (USA). The epidemiological parameters were compared with those aged over 60 years and with those reported by other foreign studies. Sixty-six MDS cases aged under 50 years, representing 16% in the registry, were identified. Among them, 19 cases (28.3%) were under 30 years, and the overall average age was 36 years. A female and urban predominance, as well as very low values for the age-adjusted incidence (0.07/100,000) and its temporal trend (slope value 0.0098\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.002) characterized this cohort. The temporal trend was significantly lower than that of the over 60, but similar with that of the 51\u201359 years group. This study indicates a higher proportion of young patients with MDS in Romania than in the Western countries, but lower than in the Asian ones. It suggests that MDS in adults aged under 50 years, and even under 59 years, could be a distinct category with a mostly inborn pathogeny compared to MDS in the elderly.",

Epidemiologic data indicates that almost 5000 new cases are reported every year and 10% of these patients eventually succumb to the disease. The treatment of CML was revolutionized by the introduction of imatinib mesylate (IM, Gleevec\u00ae), a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). The clinical use of specific BCR-ABL inhibitors has resulted in a significantly improved prognosis, response rate, overall survival, and patient outcome in CML patients compared to previous therapeutic regimens. However, the complete eradication of CML in patients receiving imatinib was limited by the emergence of resistance mostly due to mutations in the ABL kinase domain and to a lesser extent by molecular residual disease after treatment. The second-generation BCR-ABL TKIs nilotinib (Tasigna\u00ae) and dasatinib (Sprycel\u00ae), showed significant activity in clinical trials in patients intolerant or resistant to imatinib therapy, except in those patients with the T315I BCR-ABL mutation.

In this study, we investigated the possible association of X-ray repair cross-complimenting group 1 (XRCC1) Arg399Gln and Arg194Trp variants with the risk of incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in Turkish population comprised of 190 healthy controls and 167 ALL patients. For Arg399Gln polymorphism, the heterozygous (Arg/Gln) and homozygous mutant (Gln/Gln) genotypes were significantly more common in the ALL patients than the controls (OR: 1.6, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Particularly, the Gln399Gln genotype significantly increased the risk of disease up to 2.0-fold (OR: 2.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Besides, Gln399Gln genotype has been found to be associated with considerably increased risk of ALL among females (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). In case of codon 194 polymorphism, no significant associations have been found with risk of childhood ALL. In addition, none of the combinations of XRCC1 codon 194 and 399 polymorphisms have been found to be significantly associated with childhood ALL risk. In the scope of this study, we have also showed that the co-presence of XRCC1 codon 399 and CYP2E1*5B and *6 polymorphisms (data for CYP2E1 polymorphisms drawn from previously published study conducted in our lab) in the same individuals considerably increased the risk for childhood ALL to 3.7-fold with borderline significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.049). The observed combined effect was considerably more prominent among females (OR\u00a0=\u00a017.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and need to further investigation. This is the first study showing combined associations of XRCC1 399Gln, CYP2E1*5B and *6 alleles with the risk of development of childhood ALL.",

The MIF \u2212173C allele results in increased MIF promoter activity and is associated with a higher serum MIF level. We hypothesized that this polymorphism may contribute to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) susceptibility. We genotyped the MIF \u2212173G/C polymorphism (rs755622) in 346 ALL cases and 516 cancer-free controls in a Chinese population and found that the variant genotype GC and the combined genotypes GC/CC were associated with a significantly higher risk of childhood ALL [adjusted odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a01.39, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20131.93 for GC and adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a01.38, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20131.89 for GC/CC]. In addition, we found that the increased risk was more pronounced among high-risk ALL and B-phenotype ALL patients. Our results suggest that the MIF \u2212173G/C polymorphism is involved in the etiology of childhood ALL and is a potential candidate gene for determining cancer susceptibility. Further validations in other populations are warranted.",

FLT3 and KIT mutated samples were significantly more sensitive to SU11657 than WT KIT and FLT3 samples. Samples without KIT or FLT3 mutations, but with a high wild-type (WT) KIT expression were significantly more sensitive to SU11657 than samples with low KIT expression.

The current study included 194 patients with CLL and 96 healthy control subjects. cKi-67 levels in plasma were determined using an electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. We normalized the cKi-67 level to the absolute number of lymphocytes in the patient's peripheral blood to establish the plasma cKi-67 index. The cKi-67 index showed significant correlation with lymph node involvement and Rai stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Higher cKi-67 index values were significantly associated with shorter survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis demonstrated that the association of the cKi-67 index with shorter survival was independent of IgVH mutation status. In a multivariate model incorporating the cKi-67 index with B2M and IgVH, only cKi-67 index and B2M levels remained as independent predictors of survival. The results of this study suggest that the plasma cKi-67 index, along with B2M level, is a strong predictor of clinical behavior in CLL.",

Of these patients, 358 had been diagnosed with AA and 51 with h-MDS (median age, 39 years). At diagnosis, 235 and 165 patients underwent karyotyping and FISH analysis, respectively. Karyotypic abnormalities and trisomy 8 and trisomy 1q FISH abnormalities were found more frequently in h-MDS patients than in AA patients. Median overall survival (OS) of h-MDS patients was shorter than that of AA patients (83 vs. 201 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007), with the OS of h-MDS patients falling between that of severe and very severe AA patients.

MAGE-A3 is widely expressed in solid tumors and is a potent candidate for immunotherapy. To determine whether MAGE-A3 expression would be a useful marker for CLCs in non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), we assessed MAGE-A3 mRNA expression in the peripheral blood of NHL patients and controls.We measured MAGE-A3 gene expression in ten lymphoma cell lines (Farage, RL, SU-DHL, Toledo, WSU-NHL, BJA-B, Daudi, Raji, Granta-519 and Jurkat) using nested RT-PCR, and determined detection sensitivity using mixtures of MAGE-A3-positive and -negative cells over a range of 1/106 to 106/106 cells. MAGE-A3 expression was determined in buffy coat samples of 40 controls and 95 NHL patients prior to treatment. Clinical characteristics (e.g., cell lineage) and international prognostic indices, including age, performance, LDH, stage and extra-nodal involvement, were evaluated and related to MAGE-A3 expression. Hazard ratios, reflecting risk for overall survival and progression-free survival, were also evaluated. Follow-up MAGE-A3 expression was evaluated at two time points: after 3\u20134 cycles of chemotherapy (80 patients) and after 6\u20138 cycles of chemotherapy (74 patients).MAGE-A3 mRNA was detected in four lymphoma cell lines \u2013 RL, Farage, Toledo and Raji \u2013 and was present in 45 of 95 (47.3%) patients with NHL, but in none of the 40 controls. The detection sensitivity was 1 in 1000 cells. MAGE-A3 expression prior to treatment was not associated with clinical features or patient survival. During follow-up, only six patients (7.5%) were positive for MAGE-A3 after 3\u20134 cycles of chemotherapy and three (4.1%) were positive after 6\u20138 cycles.The results showed that MAGE-A3 gene expression was frequent in NHL patients and decreased after effective chemotherapy, suggesting that MAGE-A3 can be used as a tumor marker for CLCs in patients with NHL.

Here we show that RUNX1 normally cooperates with the histone acetyltransferase, CBP, to regulate GM-CSF expression at two levels.

A bone marrow-engrafting CCRF-CEM leukemia model in Rag2-M mice was utilized to correlate the therapeutic and myelosuppressive properties of CPX-351 with bone marrow delivery and drug uptake in leukemia cells relative to normal bone marrow cell populations. When administered to mice bearing CCRF-CEM human leukemia xenografts, CPX-351 ablated bone marrow (BM) leukemic cells to below detectable levels for multiple weeks, whereas the free-drug cocktail only transiently suppressed leukemia growth. In contrast to the activity against leukemia cells, CPX-351 and free-drug cocktail induced similar myelosuppression in non-tumor-bearing BM. In leukemia-laden BM, drug concentrations were markedly elevated for CPX-351 over free-drug cocktail and the first dose of CPX-351, but not free-drug cocktail, potentiated BM drug accumulation for subsequent doses. Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that CPX-351 liposomes are taken up by CCRF-CEM cells and subsequently release drugs intracellularly. The improved in vivo efficacy of CPX-351 appears related to increased and prolonged exposure of synergistic cytarabine:daunorubicin ratios in BM, and the selective killing of leukemia may arise from direct liposome-leukemia cell interactions.

     "abstract": "Myelofibrosis (MF) is a clonal stem cell disorder with the potential to transform to acute leukemia, referred to as myelofibrosis in blast phase (MF-BP). The outcome of patients with MF-BP is grave with a median survival of only 2.7 months. MF-BP is largely refractory to conventional chemotherapy and intensive induction therapy fails to have a significant impact with a median survival of 3.9 months. Eleven consecutive patients were treated at our institution with MF-BP over a 2-year period. Eligible patients with an available donor received an allogeneic stem cell transplant (ASCT) and those that were not eligible or without a donor were treated with Decitabine (DEC). The median time for follow up for the entire group was 9 months (range 5\u201321 month). At 9 months (range 5\u201345 months), 67% of the patients treated with DEC were alive and at 20 months (range 9\u201323 months), 53% of patients treated with ASCT remain alive. Reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-ASCT) is a viable option that offers the potential for prolonged survival and the possibility of cure for patients with MF-BP. DEC is a tolerable outpatient chemotherapeutic regimen for MF-BP patients ineligible for transplant and deserves further prospective study.",

In myeloma, it often results from chromosomal translocations linking the CCND1 gene to the 3\u2032 part of the IgH locus constant region. This region includes a single and potent transcriptional regulatory region (RR) 3\u2032 of the C\u03b1 gene mostly active in mature B-cells. To check whether this RR alone was sufficient to deregulate CCND1, we generated mice carrying a 3\u2032IgH RR-driven human CCND1 transgene and specifically up-regulating cyclin D1 expression in B-cells. In transgenic B-cells, cyclin D1 enforced cell cycle entry in response to various stimuli (LPS, anti-IgM, anti-CD40) but also increased cell death, so that exaggerated proliferation did not result in peripheral lymphocytosis. Despite exaggerated B-cell entry into G1 phase, malignant lymphoproliferation did not occur either. Crossing of CCND1-3\u2032IgH RR mice with c-myc-3\u2032IgH RR mice did not reveal accelerated tumorigenesis as compared with c-myc-3\u2032IgH RR mice alone. The data presented here demonstrate that the 3\u2032IgH RR-mediated deregulation of CCND1 in mature B-cells cannot by itself trigger the development of lymphomas and strengthen the concept that cyclin D1 per se is not an armful proto-oncogene. Rather its overexpression in several malignancies might be only a stigma of lymphomagenesis or represent a single hit within a multiple hit process.",

The majority of patients with EMI suffered poor prognosis. To explore mechanism underlying EMI, we analyzed SHI-1 cells, a highly invasive human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, and found their strong expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), membrane type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP-2). SHI-1 cells showed higher invasive ability to traverse reconstituted basement membranes (Matrigel) and stronger activation of proMMP-2 than other leukemia cell line such as NB4, K562, U937 and THP-1 cells. When co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), the invasive capacity and proMMP-2 activation of SHI-1 cells enhanced remarkably. Furthermore, the inhibition of MMP-2, MT1-MMP, or TIMP-2 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) substantially impaired SHI-1 cells invasion and decreased proMMP-2 activation. In the contrast, up-regulated expression of TIMP-2 for 2\u20133 folds level increased cell invasion and proMMP-2 activation. These results demonstrated that constitutively high expression of MMP-2, MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 in SHI-1 cells facilitated cell invasion by promoting proMMP-2 activation. Moreover, up-regulation of TIMP-2 exhibited not a repressive but an activating effect on SHI-1 cells invasion. Our study indicated that increasing TIMP-2 in AML patients with EMI may potentially cause adverse effects, particularly in patients containing high levels of MMP-2 and MT1-MMP.",

In order to test whether myelodysplastic syndrome also carries isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutations, we stained a series of bone marrow samples from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome using an antibody specific for the R132H mutation. Three out of 71 patients exhibited antibody binding to myeloid precursor cells. The presence of the R132H mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. We demonstrated that isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 mutations occur in myelodysplasia preceding acute myeloid leukemia and that the R132H alteration can be detected by immunohistochemistry.",

We provide evidence that NUP98-PHF23, through its PHD domain, impairs TPA-induced differentiation of K562 cells.

Incidence of ITD and TKD mutations was 12\u201338% and 2\u201320%, respectively. In 9 of 11 studies, ITD was associated with high WBC count at the time of diagnosis, which is a known prognostic indicator in APL. Patients with ITD had inferior 3-year overall survival compared to patients without ITD (risk ratio 1.42, 95% CI: 1.04\u20131.95).

Patients with \u226420% smudge cells (according to ROC analysis) had a significantly shorter time to first treatment and overall survival than patients with >20% smudge cells. Multivariate Cox regression analysis identified percentages of smudge cells, stage according to Binet and CD38 expression as independent prognostic markers. The percentage of smudge cells was significantly lower in CD38+, ZAP-70+ and unmutated IgVH patients. Combined analysis of smudge cell percentages with CD38 expression provided complementary prognostic information identifying three patient subgroups with good, intermediate and poor prognosis. Comparing gene expression profiles in a subset of 12 patients we identified eight differentially expressed genes in groups with high vs. low percentage of smudge cells suggesting a role of these differentially expressed genes, especially for Tribbles homolog 2 (Trib2), in the disease progression of high risk CLL patients.In conclusion, our data confirm previous studies showing that the simple and inexpensive microscopic detection of smudge cells on blood smears prepared for routine diagnostic purposes is a novel independent factor predicting overall survival in CLL.",

Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) encoding immunogenic proteins are not expressed in almost all normal tissues and many tumor types, but are consistently derepressed by epigenetically active agents in various cancer cell lines. Since the expression of CTA genes is usually very low or absent in myeloid leukemias, we treated various AML cell lines with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC) and quantified mRNA expression of the CTAs NY-ESO-1, MAGEA1, MAGEA3 and MAGEB2. Consistent time- and dose-dependent reactivation of all 4 CTA genes was observed, with maximum mRNA levels 72\u2013144\u00a0h after treatment start. As determined by RNA microarray analyses, numerous other CTA genes (all located on the X-chromosome) were also derepressed in a time-dependent fashion by DAC. NY-ESO-1 derepression was confirmed at the protein level. By Elispot and chromium release assays we showed that the de novo expressed NY-ESO-1 protein was naturally processed and presented in a time- and dose-dependent fashion up to 8 days after the start of DAC treatment, and converted the cell lines susceptible to antigen-specific recognition by CD8+ T-cell clones. In conclusion, NY-ESO-1 and numerous other CTAs localized on the X-chromosome are readily and transiently derepressed in AML cell lines treated with DAC. The susceptibility of DAC-treated AML cell lines to antigen-specific T-cell recognition has clear implications for future clinical trials combining DAC and specific immunotherapy in AML.",

IL-6 increased the IL-10 production up to 1626\u00a0pg/ml in 6/10 cell lines. With IL-6 receptor antagonist (IL-6RA) the values of IL-10 were in the range of untreated samples (spontaneous cytokine production).

Herein, we show that gallium maltolate, a novel gallium compound, synergizes with bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, to induce cell death in MCL Granta cells. Cells exposed to either agent displayed caspase-3 activation, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and a decrease in chymotrypsin-like activity. These effects were increased with both agents in combination. Our results show for the first time that the proteasome may be a target for gallium maltolate and suggest that the therapeutic potential of combination bortezomib and gallium maltolate warrants further investigation.",

Co-expression of Tax increased the reporter gene expression directed by OPN promoter.

LtxA kills human malignant WBC lines and primary leukemia cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients, but healthy peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) are relatively resistant to LtxA-mediated cytotoxicity.

Specifically, this study analyzes the time kinetics of histone H4 and \u03b1-tubulin acetylation and associates these findings to the time course of TSA-induced PARP cleavage and DFF45 proteolysis. The results of this study show (1) that a non-responsive leukemic cell line to the apoptotic effects of TSA does not have increased acetylation levels in contrast to the responsive leukemic cell lines that show a hyperacetylated profile. This indicates that acetylation levels may be of special importance in accessing the potential sensitivities of leukemic cells to HDACIs, (2) TSA induced apoptosis in lymphocytes but at lower levels and (3) the lack of PARP cleavage and DFF45 proteolysis found in lymphocytes clearly differentiates the final stages apoptosis of human peripheral blood lymphocytes from those of the TSA-sensitive leukemic cell lines.

RosetteSep isolation achieved adequate CLL cell purity from bone marrow in only 64% of samples, but greatly reduced subsequent sort time for impure samples.This method enables clinical studies of CLL cell proliferation outside of research settings, using a shorter 2H2O intake protocol, a minimal sampling protocol, and centralised sample processing. The CLL cell isolation protocol may also prove useful in other applications.(clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00481858).",

Little is known about aberrant methylation in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a heterogeneous clonal stem cell disorder with a \u223c30% risk of transformation into secondary AML. Recent evidence demonstrated that ID4, a negative regulator of transcription, may act as a tumor-suppressor gene. To clarify the role of ID4 in MDS, we employed methylation-specific PCR (MSP) to examine the methylation status of ID4 in 144 adult de novo MDS patients. We found that ID4 methylation was present in 35.4% (n\u00a0=\u00a051) of these MDS patients and methylaiton was correlated significantly with World Health Organization (WHO) subtypes and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) risk groups.

The median survival of patients with ID4 methylation was shorter than patients without ID4 methylation (12.2 months vs. 26.9 months, P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Multivariate analysis indicated that ID4 methylation status was the independent factor that impacted leukemia-free survival (LFS).

Of the cell lines studied, HL60 proved to be the most sensitive to each of the differentiation-inducing agents when compared to THP-1, NB-4 and U-937 cell lines. Three of the VDAs tested (PRI-1906, PRI-2191 and PRI-2201) were similarly effective as 1,25D in all the cell lines tested. However, blast cells from AML showed a varying sensitivity towards 1,25D. For example, blast cells isolated from patients in which the whole or part of chromosome 7 was deleted were extremely sensitive to 1,25D and its analogs. In contrast, 1,25D failed to increase the expression of differentiation markers in blast cells isolated from patients carrying activating mutations in Flt3 gene. Since, the expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in cells with Flt3 mutations was increased to the same extent as in other AML cells this suggests that failure of these cells to differentiate lies downstream of the receptor. That blast cells with different cytogenetic abnormalities have dissimilar responses to 1,25D and its analogs, may have implications in the use of 1,25D as a \u2018differentiation therapy\u2019 for myeloid leukemias.

By sequencing, we found that miR-223 suppression in AML is not caused by DNA sequence alterations, nor is it mediated by promoter hypermethylation. The analysis of the individual contribution of both CEBPA sites to miR-223 regulation identified the site upstream of the miR-223 primary transcript as the predominant regulatory element.

Of the cases with abnormal G-band karyotypes, 6/48 (13%) showed discrepancies between FISH and G-band results, however, FISH analysis only lead to reassignment of karyotypic abnormalities to different chromosomes, MDS cytogenetic risk stratification was not altered.

Four additional cases are discussed, classified as leukemia of ambiguous lineage (LAL), because of the simultaneous detection of a CD56 negative DC2 population and of a second myeloid precursor cell population.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) complements MC by the ability to evaluate large numbers of both interphase and metaphase nuclei. However, clinically practical FISH strategies are limited to detection of known lesions. Single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A)-based karyotyping can reveal unbalanced defects with superior resolution over MC and FISH and identify segmental uniparental disomy (UPD) undetectable by either method. Using a standardized approach, we focused our investigation on detection of \u22125/del(5q), \u22127/del(7q), trisomy 8 and del(20q) in patients with MDS (N\u00a0=\u00a052), MDS/myeloproliferative overlap syndromes (N\u00a0=\u00a07) and acute myeloid leukemia (N\u00a0=\u00a015) using MC, FISH and SNP-A karyotyping. The detection rate for del(5q) was 30, 32 and 32% by MC, FISH, and SNP-A, respectively. No single method detected all defects, and detection rates improved when all methods were used. The rate for detection of del(5q) increased incrementally to 35% (MC\u00a0+\u00a0FISH), 38% (MC\u00a0+\u00a0SNP-A), 38% (FISH\u00a0+\u00a0SNP-A) and 39% (all three methods).

Aim of this study was to compare the incidence, risk factors, severity and outcome of PN and neuropathic pain in patient treated with bortezomib up-front or at relapse. We studied 55 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who received bortezomib as first line therapy and 70 pre-treated patients who received bortezomib in relapse or progression. Regarding PN, no differences were found among untreated and pre-treated patients in the incidence (55% vs 52%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.43), severity (NCI grade 3\u20134 9% vs 14%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.27), and outcome (improved/resolved 90% vs 91%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.58).

Age represented the main risk factor for PN (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036) with an increase in risk of PN amounting to 6% per year of age. In conclusion, incidence, severity and outcome of bortezomib-related PN are similar in untreated and pre-treated MM patients except for neuropathic pain which has lower incidence and shorter duration in untreated patients with less frequent need for bortezomib discontinuation. Age emerges as the most relevant risk factor for peripheral neuropathy, with a risk increase for PN of 6% per year of age.",

The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib has recently been approved for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. In this study, we investigated the induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors in several human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines and in primary cells from patients. We demonstrate that these drugs induce a high level of apoptosis in the KG1a cell line, in which the therapeutic drug daunorubicin is poorly active, compared to other AML cell lines. In parallel, we found that significantly different levels of apoptosis were induced in primary cells from patients depending on the FAB-based differentiation status of these cells. Moreover, the level of 20S proteasome in KG1a cells was also high compared to other AML cell lines, suggesting a relationship between the high sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors and an elevated amount of 20S proteasome. In good accordance, we identified two groups of patient cells expressing high and low levels of 20S proteasome, with respective high and low sensitivity to proteasome inhibitors. Further comparison of the proteasome status in KG1a and U937 cells also suggests that a high proportion of the 19S regulatory complex in U937 cells compared to the 20S core complex may explain an increased proteasome activity. Altogether, our results suggest that various AML subtypes may present different responses to proteasome inhibitors, that these molecules can be potentially considered as interesting therapeutic alternatives for these pathologies, and that the amount of 20S proteasome in AML cells may be predictive of the cellular response to these inhibitors.",

Differential expression was detected for BHLHB2, HES1, HES4, HEY1, ID1, ID2, ID3, LYL1 and TAL1, highlighting dysregulation of family members with inhibitory activity. Subsequently we focused on the mechanisms responsible for aberrant expression of LYL1 in comparison to TAL1. Quantitative genomic PCR indicated microdeletions upstream of both, TAL1 and LYL1, targeting STIL/SIL and TRMT1, respectively. Additionally, one LYL1-expressing cell line exhibited amplification of TRMT1. While deletion of STIL correlated with expression of the STIL-TAL1 fusion transcript, no TRMT-LYL1 fusion transcripts were detected in parallel with genomic rearrangements thereof. Sequence analysis of the LYL1 promoter region revealed potential binding sites for transcription factors HOXA10, LMO2 and NKX2-5. Overexpression analysis, reporter gene assays and chromatin immuno-precipitation confirmed their activating impact on LYL1 expression. In conclusion, we identified multiple mechanisms which activate LYL1 in leukemic cells, including structural genomic alterations, namely microdeletion or amplification, together with the involvement of prominent oncogenic transcription factors.",

Our goal was to investigate: (i) the spontaneous and hypoxia-induced production of pro-angiogenic factors, VEGF and Ang2, by Real-time PCR and ELISA, (ii) the degree of vascularization in CLL-infiltrated bone marrow (BM) compartment by CD34 immunohistochemical staining of microvessels and (iii) the direct angiogenic effect of CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2 by function-blocking experiments in Matrigel assays. The results demonstrated that CLL cells spontaneously express both VEGF and Ang2 and are able to secrete these factors in surrounding microenvironment. Full-length Ang2 mRNA and truncated form Ang2443 were detectable. Moreover, CLL cells were shown to enhance secretion of both VEGF and Ang2 proteins when subjected to hypoxic condition. Furthermore, increased in vivo and in vitro angiogenesis was induced by CLL cells. Enhanced BM vascularity correlated with Ig-unmutated CLL subset and increased expression of Ang2. Then, we demonstrated that supernatants obtained from CLL cells significantly increase the HUVEC tube formation in Matrigel assays and that this enhanced angiogenic capacity is mediated by both CLL-derived VEGF and Ang2. Taken together, these results suggest that several simultaneous mechanisms may be involved in the CLL capacity to induce the disruption of pre-existing vessel structures to give rise to tumor neoangiogenesis. The preliminary studies in solid tumors, showing that the disruption of Ang2 function can inhibit tumor vessel density and growth, are encouraging and suggest the possibility of new future therapeutic options targeting CLL microenvironment.",

A major obstacle to successful treatment is cellular Bu-resistance. To investigate the possible contribution of DNA hypermethylation to Bu-resistance, we examined the cytotoxic activity of combined 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC) and Bu. Exposure of Bu-resistant B5/Bu2506 ML cells to 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM DAC resulted in G2-arrest and apoptosis. The observed G2-arrest was associated with hypomethylation and subsequent expression of epigenetically controlled genes including p16INK4A, activation of the p53 pathway, and phosphorylation of CDC2. The DAC-mediated apoptosis was partly due to hypomethylation and up-regulation of XAF1, which resulted in down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2. The pro-apoptotic PUMA and BNIP3 proteins were up-regulated while pro-survival STAT3 and c-MYC were suppressed.

P53 inhibition in B5/Bu2506 cells using pifithrin-\u03b1 alleviated these effects, suggesting a role for p53 therein; this observation was supported by the relative resistance of p53-null K562 cells to [DAC\u00a0+\u00a0Bu] combinations and by the effects of an anti-p53 shRNA on the OCI-AML3 cell line. We conclude that the synergistic effects of [DAC\u00a0+\u00a0Bu] are p53-dependent and involve cell cycle arrest, apoptosis induction and down-regulation of pro-survival genes. Our results suggest that, depending on tumor p53 status, incorporation of DAC might synergistically improve the cytoreductive efficacy of Bu-based pretransplant regimen in patients with ML.",

However, these methods do not provide any information about telomerase activation at an individual cell level. To analyze cells separately, those cells have to be isolated by sometimes complicated method. The immunohistochemical detection of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) is useful to detect telomerase positive cells in a background of non-cancerous cells.A method has been developed for the detection of intranuclear hTERT protein, in a subpopulation of hematopoietic cells, using concurrent staining of a cell surface antigen and multicolor flow cytometry.Only mouse monoclonal anti-hTERT antibody demonstrated the specific positivity in immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescent flow cytometry. Human leukemia and myeloma cell lines showed 100% positivity, whereas normal neutrophils showed 0% positivity. hTERT expression was analyzed in hematopoietic precursor cells of bone marrow samples using concurrent staining of surface CD34 antigen and intracellular hTERT protein and multi-parameter flow cytometry. CD34 positive cells demonstrated higher expression of hTERT than CD34 negative cells.A quick, easy and sensitive assay for determining the hTERT protein expression has been developed. Using this method and the multi-parameter nature of flow cytometry and its ability to identify cellular subpopulations will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms regarding the activation of telomerase.",

We screened a library of 2000 marketed drugs and naturally occurring compounds to identify agents that potentiate the cytotoxic effects of ATO in leukemic cells. Here, we report the identification of three isothiocyanates (sulforaphane, erysolin and erucin) found in cruciferous vegetables as enhancers of ATO cytotoxicity. Both erysolin and sulforaphane significantly enhanced ATO-mediated cytotoxicity and apoptosis in a panel of leukemic cell lines; erucin activity was variable among cell types. Cellular exposure to sulforaphane in combination with ATO resulted in a dramatic increase in levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to treatment with either agent alone. Sulforaphane, alone or with ATO, decreased intracellular glutathione (GSH) content. Furthermore, addition of the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) rescued cells from ATO/isothiocyanate-mediated cytotoxicity. Our data suggest that isothiocyanates enhance the cytotoxic effects of ATO through a ROS-dependent mechanism. Combinatorial treatment with isothiocyanates and ATO might provide a promising therapeutic approach for a variety of myeloid malignancies.",

They are characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis which results in quantitative and qualitative cellular defects and high incidence of leukemic transformation. Recent advances in MDS research have led to the development of novel agents which appears to improve remission rates and survival when compared to best supportive care. Currently azacitidine, decitabine, and lenalidomide are approved by the US FDA for the treatment of MDS, while the activity of other novel agents such as histone deacetylase inhibitors, farnesyl-transferase inhibitors, novel thrombopoietic agents, and anti-angiogenesis molecules is under evaluation. Erythropoietin-stimulating agents, iron chelating therapy and thrombopoietin receptor ligands may also improve quality of life and possibly prolong survival in MDS patients. The only treatment modality that can achieve long-term survival is the allogeneic SC transplantation which is given only in selected patients. Moreover the heterogeneity of MDS and the patient's advanced age and co-morbidity are significant factors besides cytogenetics, IPSS and WPSS that should be taken into account during the decision-making process. Therefore clinicians should treat patients with MDS on an individual basis aiming the increase of the response rates and the decrease of treatment-associated toxicities. This can only be achieved through the better understanding of the MDS subgroups. If we can better define MDS subgroups we will be able to identify patients who will benefit from the incorporation of the novel agents, as monotherapy or in combinations regimens along with supportive care.",

So far, the assessment of MRD in cases of diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) has had some technical limitations, such as requiring patient-specific primers and complicated experimental steps. To resolve these problems, we applied a tumor-specific epigenetic alteration of the p57KIP2 gene as a biomarker for detecting MRD in DLBCL. The methylation of the p57KIP2 gene was analyzed in 63 cases of DLBCL by methylation-specific real-time quantitative PCR. Methylation of the p57KIP2 gene was detected in 53 (84.1%) of these 63 cases of DLBCL. We could detect one p57KIP2 gene-methylated cell among 10,000 unmethylated cells by the serial dilution experiment. This sensitivity is proved to be equivalent to that of detection of bcl2/IgH rearrangement by real-time quantitative PCR. This sensitivity could be converted to the detection of two methylated genomes per reaction. Using clinical material, the same results were confirmed. In this study, we established a convenient and universal method for detecting MRD in DLBCL. This technique is applicable for over 80% of patients with DLBCL. This could promote systemic MRD studies in the area of DLBCL.",

     "abstract": "Epidemiology and outcome of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) in the United States is not well recognized. MDS became reportable to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) in 2001. We report first study of MDS among large population in the Veteran Affair system.There are approximately 127 VA Medical Centers diagnosing and/or treating Cancer patients. The data collected by the medical centers cancer registries is aggregated as the VA Central Cancer Registry (VACCR). We used the VACCR to analyze VA patients with MDS diagnosed between 1995 and 2006. The cases were identified using ICD-03 histology codes for MDS.A total of 2242 MDS cases were registered during the period analyzed. The median overall survival (OS) was 2.1 years, but varied by French-American-British category. Median OS for patients with RA, RARS and RAEB was 3.4, 4.9, and 0.7 years, respectively. No differences in OS were observed by race.Outcome of MDS in the VA was similar to what is described in literature and reported by the SEER Program. Appropriate coding for WHO subtypes, IPSS and treatment details are needed in all MDS registries to facilitate comparisons across populations.",

It never occurred as a sole abnormality and was associated with other changes (6q deletion; 1p gain). The region of 2p gain frequently included two oncogenes, REL and MYCN. All patients with gain of REL were unmutated for IGHV (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Gain of MYCN was associated with increased mRNA expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), suggesting a pathogenic role for MYCN. Gain of 2p appears to be a marker of progression and may contribute to the poor prognosis.",

Additionally, increased apoptosis was observed in Ramos and Jurkat lines. These results demonstrate that GCP is effective in lymphoid cell lines of both human and canine origin. Due to its minimal toxicities, increased bioavailability, and in vitro efficacy, GCP may have clinical utility in the treatment of patients with lymphoma.",

We combined protein kinase A (PKA) activation with a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) activator tetradecylthioacetic acid, resulting in synergistic decrease in viability of AML cell lines. PKA isoform II activation appeared to be involved in inhibition of proliferation but not induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Inhibition of CREB function protected against this anti-leukaemic effect with higher efficiency than enforced Bcl-2 expression. Preclinical studies employing the rat AML model Brown Norwegian Myeloid Leukaemia also indicated anti-leukaemic activity of the combination therapy in vivo. In conclusion, combined PKA and pan-PPAR activation should be explored further to determine its therapeutic potential.",

     "abstract": "The combination of ATO and bortezomib (ATO\u00a0+\u00a0bortezomib) has been recently shown to enhance antimyeloma activity; nevertheless, the mechanisms remained unclear in these studies. However, both bortezomib and ATO have been shown to activate the p38 MAPK pathway, which may counteract the enhancement induced by this combination. We studied the cytotoxicity of bortezomib, ATO, and ATO\u00a0+\u00a0bortezomib with or without inhibiting p38 MAPK, along with associated molecular changes in myeloma cells. The treatment of myeloma cells with ATO\u00a0+\u00a0bortezomib induced higher cytotoxicity than either agent alone. This increased cytotoxicity was further synergistically enhanced by inhibiting p38 MAPK. This effect was preserved in the presence of marrow stromal cells designed to simulate the tumor micro-environment and in the CD138+ neoplastic plasma cells directly isolated from myeloma patients. The enhanced cytotoxicity of ATO\u00a0+\u00a0bortezomib was associated with augmented STAT3 inhibition and JNK activation, up-regulation of Bim, p21, p27, p53 as well as down-regulation of Bcl-2. Furthermore, the synergistically potentiated apoptosis by p38 MAPK inhibition was associated with the attenuation of ATO\u00a0+\u00a0bortezomib-mediated activation of Hsp27 as well as the enhancement of ATO\u00a0+\u00a0bortezomib-mediated JNK activation, p53 up-regulation, and Bcl-2 down-regulation. The results suggest the opportunity for using p38 MAPK inhibition to enhance the efficacy of ATO\u00a0+\u00a0bortezomib in myeloma.",

     "abstract": "We demonstrate here that TPA activates HTLV-1 LTR expression in Jurkat and H9 T-cell lines, by strictly different mechanisms. In Jurkat cells this activation is exerted by a PKC\u03b1- and PKC\u025b-antagonized mechanism which operates through an Sp1 binding site residing within the Est responsive region 1 of the LTR. On the other hand, in H9 cells TPA activates the LTR by two consecutive mechanisms; the first depends on PKC\u03b7 activity and is exerted through the 21\u00a0bp repeats of the LTR, whereas the second is analogous to that observed in Jurkat cells, except that it is antagonized by PKC\u03b4.",

In vivo, a single reovirus injection intra-tumorally resulted in complete regression of both the injected and the contra-lateral tumor in a subcutaneous bi-tumor model, in one out of three cell lines tested. Reovirus treatment of MCL seems feasible but will need to be guided by the presence of molecular determinants of reovirus susceptibility.",

Myeloblasts from seven cases (CD34-selected\u00a0=\u00a04; unselected\u00a0=\u00a03) were transplanted into NOD/SCID mice. Five cases engrafted successfully into 14 mice. Two patients carried single FLT3/ITD subclones, which were maintained during primary and secondary transplantations. In three patients with multiple FLT3/ITD subclones, some subclones persisted or expanded while others diminished upon transplantation. Their different engraftment capabilities in NOD/SCID mice supported the proposition that FLT3/ITD might occur at different stages during leukemogenesis.",

Our data indicate that molecular biological techniques should be used in selected cases to integrate data obtained with standard cytogenetics: using RT-PCR we showed that inversion of chromosome 16 was already present before RIT, in striking contrast to the normal karyotype found with conventional cytogenetics. This approach will allow investigators to avoid misleading data and provide support for conclusions regarding the side effects of treatment.",
