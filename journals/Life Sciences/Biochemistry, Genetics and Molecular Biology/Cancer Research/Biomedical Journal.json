     "abstract": "This special edition of the Biomedical Journal puts the innate immune system into the limelight. We learn about the universal mechanisms underlying the immediate defense against influenza viruses mounted by innate immunity but also its detrimental secondary effects and how differential host genetics influence the network. Moreover, this issue addresses how oral hygiene is a concern for the entire organism, that younger age goes well with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer and zinc with feeling less distressed by tinnitus caused by noise-induced hearing loss, and that IL-1Ra holds very promising potential to prevent intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury. Finally, we discover which type of post optimally protects devitalized teeth from breaking and how difficult it is to accurately diagnose the macrofollicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma.",

Whether this reflects an intrinsic capacity of the virus to induce an exaggerated inflammatory responses or its remarkable ability to reproduce in\u00a0vivo is still open to debate. Tremendous progress has recently been made in our understanding of innate immune responses to influenza infection and it is now time to translate this knowledge into therapeutic strategies, particularly in view of the possible occurrence of future outbreaks caused by virulent strains.",

     "abstract": "The role of host genetics in influenza infection is unclear despite decades of interest. Confounding factors such as age, sex, ethnicity and environmental factors have made it difficult to assess the role of genetics without influence. In recent years a single nucleotide polymorphism, interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) rs12252, has been shown to alter the severity of influenza infection in Asian populations. In this review we investigate this polymorphism as well as several others suggested to alter the host's defence against influenza infection. In addition, we highlight the open questions surrounding the viral restriction protein IFITM3 with the hope that by answering some of these questions we can elucidate the mechanism of IFITM3 viral restriction and therefore how this restriction is altered due to the rs12252 polymorphism.",

These diseases include cardiovascular disease, gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer, diabetes and insulin resistance, and Alzheimer's disease, as well as respiratory tract infection and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The presence of periodontal pathogens and their metabolic by-products in the mouth may in fact modulate the immune response beyond the oral cavity, thus promoting the development of systemic conditions. A cause-and-effect relationship has not been established yet for most of the diseases, and the mediators of the association are still being identified. A better understanding of the systemic effects of oral microorganisms will contribute to the goal of using the oral cavity to diagnose and possibly treat non-oral systemic disease.",

     "abstract": "Intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury is a frequent clinical damage, in which the oxidative stress and inflammation play an important role. Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) is a natural anti-inflammatory factor, however, its effect on intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury remains unclear.The rat model of intestinal I/R was induced by occlusion (for 60\u00a0min) and reopening (for 60\u00a0min) of superior mesenteric artery. The rats were randomly divided into the following 5 groups: sham-operation(S), model (I/R),10\u00a0mg/kgIL-1Ra\u00a0+\u00a0I/R (C1),20\u00a0mg/kgIL-1Ra\u00a0+\u00a0I/R (C2), and30\u00a0mg/kgIL-1Ra\u00a0+\u00a0I/R (C3).In this study it was the first time to confirm that IL-1Ra had a significant protection against the intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury. IL-1Ra not only effectively inhibited the expression of inflammatory factors (such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) and the activation of neutrophil in intestinal tissues, but also decreased the death of intestinal cells and the damages of intestinal tissues. Interestingly, besides anti-inflammation effect, it was also found that IL-1Ra possessed a significant inhibitory effect on the oxidative stress caused by ischemia/reperfusion injury. Furthermore, the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), and the phosphorylation level of Nrf2 were greatly promoted by IL-1Ra. At the same time, IL-1Ra inhibited the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPKs) pathway.IL-1Ra had the protective effect against intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury, its mechanism included anti-inflammation and anti-oxidative stress in which the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway played an important role. The above-mentioned results may extend the clinical application of IL-1Ra in the treatment of intestinal ischemia reperfusion injury.",

     "abstract": "Zinc plays a vital antioxidant role in human metabolism. Recent studies have demonstrated a correlation between noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) and oxidative injury; however, no investigation has focused specifically on the subgroup of NIHL associated tinnitus patients. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of zinc supplementation in treating NIHL associated tinnitus.Twenty patients with tinnitus and a typical NIHL audiogram (38 ears) were included in this study. Another 20 healthy subjects were used as the control group. A full medical history assessment was performed, and each subject underwent an otoscopic examination, basic audiologic evaluation, distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs), tinnitus-match testing, Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and serum zinc level analyses. After 2 months of treatment with zinc, all tests were repeated.There was a significant difference between pretreatment and post-treatment within the tinnitus group (73.6 vs. 84.6\u00a0\u03bcg/dl). The pre- and post-treatment difference in serum zinc was significantly higher in the young group (\u226650 years) compared to the old group (19.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.4 vs. 2.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.2\u00a0\u03bcg/dl, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002). There were no statistically significant differences in hearing thresholds, speech reception thresholds, or tinnitus frequency and loudness results before and after treatment. In addition, 17 patients (85%) showed statistically significant improvement of THI-total scores post-treatment, from 38.3 to 30 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024).Zinc oral supplementation elevated serum zinc levels, especially in younger patients. THI scores improved significantly following zinc treatment in patients with NIHL associated tinnitus. However, no improvements in objective hearing parameters were observed.",

The aim of this study was to compare the fracture resistance and fracture mode of endodontically treated thin-walled teeth which restored with different post systems.Eighty extracted and endodontically treated maxillary canines were divided into 4 groups (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and the thickness of the radicular dentin walls was reduced by using diamond burs. Each root was embedded in an autopolymerizing resin with a 0.25\u00a0mm layer of vinyl polysiloxane material to simulate the periodontal ligament. The subgroups were restored with one of the following post systems: only composite resin (Group 1), cast post (Group 2), glass-fiber post (Group 3), and I-TFC post (Group 4). The samples were subjected to a gradually increasing force (0,5\u00a0mm/min). The force required to fracture was recorded, and the data were analyzed with ANOVA, Tukey test's and Chi\u2013Square test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The highest fracture resistance was recorded for Group 2, followed by the Group 3, Group 4, and Group 1. Differences in the fracture resistance of teeth were significant among the groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The fracture resistance of Group 4 was significantly different than the other tested post systems (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).The lowest fracture resistance was recorded for Group 1, but among all post systems, Group 4 had the lowest fracture resistance. The fracture mode of the fiber posts (Radix and I-TFC posts) would permit repair of the tooth.",

Preoperative thyroid US findings, clinical presentation, treatment outcomes, and survival rates were analyzed.Mean tumor size was significantly greater in patients with MFVPTC than that in those with FVPTC (4.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1\u00a0cm vs. 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0cm; p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). No patient with MFVPTC had lymph node involvement, but one had a micrometastasis to the lung, which responded well to therapeutic radioiodine. All MFVPTC lesions were isoechoic on US. Eight nodules had calcifications and eight had irregular margins. FNAC showed that these tumors had low cellularity, absence or focal presence of enlarged clear nuclei, and subtle or focal nuclear features of PTC. Cells were, arranged in microfollicular pattern, with abundant colloid background. Multifocal PTCs were detected in the opposite lobe of two patients. All 11 patients with MFVPTC had excellent outcomes. No patient experienced recurrence, and survival rates were high.Malignant US criteria combined with FNAC features have a low preoperative diagnostic rate for MFVPTC. Surgery is recommended for patients with thyroid nodules larger than 4\u00a0cm and those with subtle and focal atypical nuclei in FNAC.",

A pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC associated with favorable long-term outcomes has been described. There is still a high locoregional recurrence (LRR) rate after NAC and the influence of age on LRR after NAC is unclear. This study analyzed the relationship between age and LRR after NAC.Two hundred and sixty-three patients with invasive breast cancer who received NAC followed by mastectomy or breast conserving surgery (BCS) were enrolled. Concurrent weekly epirubicin and docetaxel was the NAC regimen.Twenty-nine patients (11%) achieved a pCR after NAC. In univariate analysis, age <50 years, luminal B (HER2 positive) subtype, HER2 overexpression subtype, and triple-negative subtype were factors to predict a pCR. In multivariate analysis, age <50 years, luminal B (HER2 positive) type, HER2 overexpression, and triple-negative subtype were the independent factors to predict a pCR. No patients in the pCR group developed LRR compared with 31 patients in the non-pCR group. Eleven patients (6.9%) in the younger group (age <50 years) developed LRR compared with 20 patients (19.4%) in the older group (age \u226550 years). In multivariate analysis, younger age (<50 years) was the only independent prognostic factor for a LRR-free survival.Younger age can predict a pCR and is an independent prognostic factor for LRR in locally advanced breast cancer patients after NAC as concurrent epirubicin and docetaxel.",

     "abstract": "At a glance commentary Scientific background on the subject Since Adriamycin is used as an anticancer drug among various communities and is one of its side-effects, it is important to find a way to prevent this complication. Of these, medicinal plants such as Zataria multiflora can be important in preventing the complications. What this study adds to the field This study shows that carvacrol has a stronger effect on the liver antioxidant system as well as hepatic enzymes activity than the whole plant extract, and then carvacrol can be more helpful than whole plant in the treatment of hepatic damage caused by Adriamycin. Due to antioxidant effects of Zataria multiflora (ZM) and Carvacrol (CAR) in many cases and the prominent role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in hepatotoxicity induced by Adriamycin (ADR), the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of ZM and CAR on ADR-induced hepatotoxicity.Twenty four male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups including: 1)Control, 2)Adriamycin (ADR), 3,4) ZM\u00a0+\u00a0ADR and CAR\u00a0+\u00a0ADR that received ZM and CAR for 28 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected on the days 0, 14 and 28 to determine the alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Also, the hepatic redox markers were evaluated.ADR significantly increased ALP, ALT and AST in comparison with the control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 - p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In CAR\u00a0+\u00a0ADR group, the serum ALP, ALT and AST were significantly reduced compared to those of the ADR group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 to p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Also, in ZM\u00a0+\u00a0ADR group, serum ALP and ALT compared to ADR was significantly reduced (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). MDA level in the ADR group significantly increased compared to control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The MDA level in ZM\u00a0+\u00a0ADR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and CAR\u00a0+\u00a0ADR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) groups were significantly reduced compared to that of ADR. Thiol levels in ZM\u00a0+\u00a0ADR group significantly increased compared to the ADR group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The activities of CAT in the ADR group was significantly reduced compared to control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and increased in treatment groups in comparison with the ADR (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).Long-term administration of ZM extract and CAR could reduce the oxidative damage in the rat liver induced by ADR through the strengthening of the antioxidant system.",

Rates of DKA after diagnosis, severe hypoglycemia, and the level of glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) improvement during the follow-up period were analyzed.Of the 825 patients, 226 receiving a premixed regimen were matched to the same number of patients receiving a basal-bolus regimen. In the matched cohort, DKA (10.62% vs. 5.31%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.037) and severe hypoglycemic episodes (25.22% vs. 10.62%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) were significantly higher in patients receiving a premixed regimen than those receiving a basal-bolus regimen. The median reduction of HbA1c, compared to the treatment-naive level, was better with the basal-bolus regimen than with the premixed regimen in both matched (2.2 vs. 2.1; p\u00a0=\u00a00.034) and the entire (3.1 vs. 1.9; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) cohorts. Regardless of insulin regimen, a higher HbA1c level was significantly linked to higher risk of DKA development (hazard ratio [HR] 1.35 per 1% increase; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) once the HbA1c level was \u22657.5%.A premixed insulin regimen may increase the DKA occurrence rate and severe hypoglycemic risk in children, adolescents, and young adults with TIDM, compared to a basal-bolus regimen. Tight glycemic control with HbA1c < 7.5% may prevent the increased risk of DKA.",

Intraclass correlation coefficient estimates for interobserver reliability and a simple regression analysis for criterion validity were calculated. Spearman correlation analysis was then performed. The analyzed parameters included cervical passive range of motion for lateral flexion and rotation, area, brightness, max/min Feret's diameters, and muscular width/thickness.Of the 29 (4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.6 months) screened infants, 13 (1.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7 months) were included. Nine were male, and 4 were female. Seven infants with mass were ultrasonographically classified into type I, and the other six infants were classified into type II. The affected/unaffected side ratios of cervical passive range of motion for lateral flexion and rotation were 0.92\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.13 and 0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.16, respectively. The parameters measured on the sonograms were reliable, and the max/min Feret's diameters were valid measurements. The affected/unaffected side ratio of cervical passive range of motion for rotation significantly correlated with the affected/unaffected side ratios of the sternocleidomastoid muscle sonogram on area (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.62, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and min Feret's diameter (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.69, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).The area and min Feret's diameter were efficacious parameters for image analysis on sternocleidomastoid sonograms, and the min Feret's diameter would be more suitable than thickness for measuring the thickening SCM in transverse view. A healthy control group, more data and follow-up would be needed to confirm the changes on the SCM sonograms for clinical decision.",

     "abstract": "To describe a novel operative technique resulting in extended durability and improved ease of use of current flexible ureteroscopes (FURS). A surgical method employing a modified technique of using an Olympus digital flexible URF-V ureteroscope was developed.We retrospectively studied 546 patients who underwent retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) using this modified approach performed by a single surgeon at our hospital, and investigated the outcome and durability of the ureteroscope.Through the study period, the URF-V ureteroscope required repair five times in total. During factory maintenance, distal working channel damage was noted twice, and outer bending rubber damage was noted once. The most recent two repairs were required due to laser penetration. Despite the damage and repairs, the deflection system was almost entirely intact after high-frequency use. The durability of FURS determines the efficacy of RIRS for renal stones.In this report, we described our modified upside-down technique for manipulation of FURS under unequal dual deflection in order to preserve the deflection apparatus, which yielded a greatly prolonged durability. Additionally, the use of mimic drive turning decreased the time needed to train urologists.",

According to epidemiological data from the Center for Disease Control of Taiwan, more than 98.62% of outbreaks of indigenous total dengue cases were reported in the southern part of Taiwan. Southern Taiwan is an aggregate area encompassing Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung, all of which are located below the Tropic of Cancer (23\u00ba35\u2032N). With a few exceptions, dengue outbreaks mainly occur in southern Taiwan which is highly associated or overlaps with the prevalence of Aedes aegypti. A.aegypti is presumed to be absent from the northern part of Taiwan, while Aedes albopictus breeds in areas throughout the island. According a collection of 20 years of epidemiological data from Taiwan, the inability of A. aegypti to survive the winter weather in northern Taiwan may account for its restricted geographical distribution and that of dengue outbreaks it transmits. A.aegypti, unlike temperate strains of A. albopictus, lacks embryonic diapause signaled by a short photoperiod which thus reduces its cold-hardiness. Therefore it is intolerant of low temperatures that frequently accompany rains and unable to survive during winter in the northern part of Taiwan.",

Human umbilcal card blood MSCs were cultured under dynamic and static conditions to elucidate the role of dynamic fluid flow in osteogenesis of MSCs.The human MSCs distribution over the scaffolds was confirmed with fluorescent microscopy. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium mineralization, and collagen formation were found to be higher in PLA90 scaffolds than PLA100 and PLA75. PLA90 scaffolds with better cell adhesion/proliferartion were considered for bioreactor studies and they exhibited enhanced ALP, Ca+2 mineralization and collagen formation under dynamic perfusion than static culture. We further confirmed our observation by looking at expression levels of osteogenic marker (Runx2 and osteonectin) in differentiated MSCs subjected to perfusion culture compared to static culture.The results of the current investigation once again proves that dynamic perfusion cultures improve the osteogenic differentiation of MSCs over hybrid polymer scaffolds (PLA90) for effective bone regeneration.",

In addition, barbiturate-induced sleeping time (BIST) was used to analyze sedative effect. Finally, electrocorticogram (ECoG) recordings were used to characterize brain-wave patterns. The results showed that geraniol treatment in rats decreased the distance traveled, rearing numbers and lead to increase in immobility time in HB and OF tests. In BIST test, geraniol treatment increased sleep duration but not sleep latency in the animals. Furthermore, geraniol-treated animals demonstrated an increase in the percentage of delta waves in the total spectrum power.

The neurological status, by Frankel classification, was recorded preoperatively and at discharge. Group X had neurologic improvement of at least 1 grade, group Y had unchanged neurologic status, and group Z showed deterioration. We recorded the patient demographic data, presenting symptoms and signs, interval from admission to surgery, surgical procedure, laboratory data, perioperative antibiotic course, pathogens identified, coexisting medical disease, concomitant nonspinal infection, and clinical outcomes. We intended to evaluate the different characteristics of patients who improved neurologically after treatment.The mean age of our cohort was 56.6 years. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion was the most commonly performed surgical procedure (74.1%). The Frankel neurological status improved in 70.4% (group X, n\u00a0=\u00a019) and unchanged in 29.6% (group Y, n\u00a0=\u00a08). No patients worsened. Motor weakness was most common (96.3%) neurological deficit, followed by sensory abnormalities (37.0%), and bowel/urine incontinence (33.3%). The main difference in presentation between group X and group Y was neck pain (100% vs. 75.0%; p\u00a0=\u00a0.02), not fever.

A cognitive testing procedure was subsequently performed to evaluate the ease of understanding and acceptability of the test in 30 patients with diabetes. Thereafter, a quantitative survey (N\u00a0=\u00a0232) was administered for validating the NVS-TC against the accepted standard tests of HL and participant education level.The internal consistency (Cronbach's \u03b1) was 0.76.

Air pollution has been known as a major health hazard for decades. While its effects on cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality have been extensively studied, growing evidence has emerged that exposure to polluted air is associated with impaired cognitive functions at all ages and increased risk of AD and other dementias in later life; this association is particularly notable with traffic related pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, nitrous oxide, black carbon, and small diameter airborne solids and liquids known as particulate matter. The exact mechanisms by which air pollutants mediate neurotoxicity in the central nervous system (CNS) and lead to cognitive decline and AD remain largely unknown. Studies using animal and cell culture models indicate that amyloid-beta processing, anti-oxidant defense, and inflammation are altered following the exposure to constituents of polluted air. In this review, we summarize recent evidence supporting exposure to air pollution as a risk for cognitive decline at all ages and AD at later lifetime. Additionally, we review the current body of work investigating the molecular mechanisms by which air pollutants mediate damage in the CNS. Understanding of the neurotoxic effects of air pollution and its constituents is still limited, and further studies will be essential to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms linking air pollution and cognitive decline.",

Autophagy-associated LC3A/B-II formation was selectively suppressed by FVII/PAR2 signaling which mediated by mTOR activation through Atg7 but not Atg5/Atg12 axis. The coagulant-derived autophagic suppression seemed potentiate a vicious circle of malignancy in producing more FVII and PAR2 which facilitate in\u00a0vivo and in\u00a0vitro tumor progression of HCC and the investigations are consistent with the clinical observations. In this review, we briefly summarize the current understanding of autophagy and discuss recent evidence for its role in HCC malignancy.",

     "abstract": "\u03b1-synuclein (SNCA) accumulation in the substantia nigra is one of the characteristic pathologies of Parkinson's disease (PD). A53T missense mutations in the SNCA gene has been proved to enhance the expression of SNCA and accelerate the onset of PD. Mitochondrial dysfunction in SNCA aggregation has been under debate for decades but the causal relationship remains uncertain. At a later stage of PD, the cellular dysfunctions are complicated and multiple factors are tangled. Our aim here is to investigate the mitochondrial functional changes and clarify the main causal mechanism at earlier-stage of PD.We used the mutant A53T SNCA-expressed neuro 2a (N2a) cells without detectable cell death to investigate: 1) whether SNCA overexpression impairs the mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis. 2) The role of nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) signal in SNCA\u2013induced mitochondria dysfunction.Accompanying with the increment of SNCA, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was increased. The maximal respiratory capacity was suppressed. Meanwhile, mitochondrial complex 1 activity and the activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) cytochrome C reductase (NCCR) were decreased. Moreover, the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number was decreased. On the other hand, the nuclear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), Nrf2, and the cytosolic mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) were increased at an early stage and declined thereafter. Above factors triggered by SNCA were reversed by tBHQ, a Nrf2 activator.These results suggested that at an early stage, SNCA-overexpressed increase mtROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA decrement. Nrf2, PGC-1\u03b1 and TFAM were upregulated to compromise mitochondrial dysfunction. tBHQ effectively reversed the SNCA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Some oral bacteria, like Porphyromonas gingivalis, evade the host immune response by inhibiting inflammation. On the other hand, F. nucleatum triggers inflammasome activation and release of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) in infected gingival epithelial cells.In this study, we characterized the pro-inflammatory response to F. nucleatum oral infection in BALB/c mice. Western blots and ELISA were used to measure cytokine and DAMP (HMGB1) levels in the oral cavity after infection. Histology and flow cytometry were used to observe recruitment of immune cells to infected tissue and pathology.Our results show increased expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection. Furthermore, we observe that F. nucleatum infection leads to recruitment of macrophages in different tissues of the oral cavity. Infection also contributes to osteoclast recruitment, which could be involved in the observed bone resorption.Overall, our findings suggest that F. nucleatum infection rapidly induces inflammation, release of DAMPs, and macrophage infiltration in gingival tissues and suggest that osteoclasts may drive bone resorption at early stages of the inflammatory process.",

Many millions become sick while hundreds of thousand die yearly. The food chain starts from farm to fork/plate while challenges include microbial, chemical, personal and environmental hygiene. Historically, documented human tragedies and economic disasters due to consuming contaminated food occurred as a result of intentional or unintentional personal conduct and governmental failure to safeguard food quality and safety. While earlier incidents were mainly chemical contaminants, more recent outbreaks have been due to microbial agents. The Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributed to these agents are most devastating to children younger than 5 years of age, the elderly and the sick. To ensure food safety and to prevent unnecessary foodborne illnesses, rapid and accurate detection of pathogenic agents is essential. Culture-based tests are being substituted by faster and sensitive culture independent diagnostics including antigen-based assays and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels. Innovative technology such as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) coupled with nanoparticles can detect multiple target microbial pathogens' DNA or proteins using nucleic acids, antibodies and other biomarkers assays analysis. The food producers, distributors, handlers and vendors bear primary responsibility while consumers must remain vigilant and literate. Government agencies must enforce food safety laws to safeguard public and individual health. Medical providers must remain passionate to prevent foodborne illnesses and may consider treating diseases with safe diet therapy under proper medical supervision. The intimate collaboration between all the stakeholders will ultimately ensure food safety in the 21st century.",

Currently, there are no vaccines available despite the efforts made to develop a protective one. Polymorphic membrane protein D (PmpD) is an attractive immunogen candidate as it is conserved among strains and it is target of neutralizing antibodies. However, its high molecular weight and its complex structure make it difficult to handle by recombinant DNA techniques. Our aim is to predict B-cell and T-cell epitopes of PmpD.A sequence (Genbank AAK69391.2) having 99\u2013100% identity with various serovars of C. trachomatis was used for predictions. NetMHC and NetMHCII were used for T-cell epitope linked to MHC I or MHC II alleles prediction, respectively. BepiPred predicted linear B-cell epitopes. For three dimensional epitopes, PmpD was homology-modeled by Raptor X. Surface epitopes were predicted on its globular structure using DiscoTope.NetMHC predicted 271 T-cell epitopes of 9-12aa with weak affinity, and 70 with strong affinity to MHC I molecules. NetMHCII predicted 2903\u00a0T-cell epitopes of 15aa with weak affinity, and 742 with strong affinity to MHC II molecules. Twenty four linear B-cell epitopes were predicted. Raptor X was able to model 91% of the three-dimensional structure whereas 57 residues of discontinuous epitopes were suggested by DiscoTope. Six regions containing B-cell and T-cell epitopes were identified by at least two predictors.PmpD has potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes distributed throughout the sequence.

     "abstract": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia (60\u201380% of cases). In 2016, nearly 44 million people were affected by AD or related dementia. AD is characterized by progressive neuronal damages leading to subtle and latter obvious decline in cognitive functions including symptoms such as memory loss or confusion, which ultimately require full-time medical care. Its neuropathology is defined by the extracellular accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptide into amyloid plaques, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) consisting of aggregated hyper- and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein. The latter, identified also as Tau pathology, is observed in a broad spectrum of neurological diseases commonly referred to as \u201cTauopathies\u201d. Besides these lesions, sustained neuroinflammatory processes occur, involving notably micro- and astro-glial activation, which contribute to disease progression. Recent findings from genome wide association studies further support an instrumental role of neuroinflammation. While the interconnections existing between this innate immune response and the amyloid pathogenesis are widely characterized and described as complex, elaborated and evolving, only few studies focused on Tau pathology. An adaptive immune response takes place conjointly during the disease course, as indicated by the presence of vascular and parenchymal T-cell in AD patients' brain. The underlying mechanisms of this infiltration and its consequences with regards to Tau pathology remain understudied so far. In the present review, we highlight the interplays existing between Tau pathology and the innate/adaptive immune responses.",

In pathological conditions, chemokines participate in neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), chemokines play a role in the development of the two main lesions, amyloid \u03b2 plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In addition, they contribute to the inflammatory response by recruiting T cells and controlling microglia/macrophages activation. Actually, targeting inflammatory pathways seems a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of AD patients. This review summarizes our current knowledge on the roles of chemokines in AD animal models and the underlying mechanisms in which they take part.

Bypass fixation over the diaphysis has achieved clinical success in cases of proximal femoral bone loss. Fracture of cementless, fully bead-coated femoral stem is an uncommon complication. The purpose of this study is to analyze the patients with and without fracture stem and find out the possible risk factors.From 2006 to 2012, a total of 251 revision long stems (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN) were implanted. In the same period, 17 broken stems that underwent treatment were included for analysis. Patients' demographic data, pattern of femoral bone loss, stem size, medial calcar support in the proximal region of the stem, and the timing of stem breakage were collected and analyzed.The stem size in patients with a broken stem was smaller (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and medial calcar defect was 12.4% and 100% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), respectively. The bone defect was greater in broken group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024). The mean duration between revision surgery and stem breakage was 58.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a036.98 months. Smaller stem size, greater bone defect, and inadequate medial calcar bone support were major risk factors for stem breakage.Bypass fixation in the distal diaphysis with a long stem prosthesis without adequate bone support over medial calcar area may cause stress concentration in the long stem and a fatigue fracture. Use of a smaller prosthesis is the major risk of stem broken. It is essential to repair the proximal femoral bone deficiency and implant selection for better metaphyseal engagement to prevent further stem complications.Level III, case control study.",

     "abstract": "Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is defined as elevation in serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels despite normal serum levels of free thyroxine. It remains controversial whether people with SCH have higher total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels compared to normal-thyroid subjects. The aim of this study was to assess the metabolic risk factors for SCH.Subjects were recruited from the health examination center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Linkou, from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011. This was a cross-sectional review of medical records. The subjects were ethnic Taiwanese residents without known thyroid disease at baseline.A total of 22,324 subjects received annual health examination at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from 2010 to 2011. Among them, 15,943 subjects were included as the normal thyroid group (NG), and 203 subjects (101 men and 102 women) met the criteria for SCH. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the NG was 26.2% in men and 18.7% in women, whereas that in the SCH group was 39.6% in men and 29.4% in women. Women in the SCH group showed significantly higher cholesterol, triglyceride, non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) and cholesterol/HDL levels than those in the NG (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).Because SCH is more prevalent in women and the risk increases with age, greater attention to the risk of MetS development is warranted. As for men, regardless of thyroid function, the risk of MetS development with age still warrants attention. Thus, our data suggest that national guidelines for screening for thyroid disease using serum TSH levels in the elderly are mandatory.",

     "abstract": "In the normal non-diseased lung, various macrophage populations maintain homeostasis and sterility by ingesting and clearing inhaled particulates, pathogens and apoptotic cells from the local environment. This process of phagocytosis leads to the degradation of the internalized material, coordinated induction of gene expression, antigen presentation and cytokine production, implicating phagocytosis as a central regulator of innate immunity. Phagocytosis is extremely efficient and any perturbation of this function is deleterious. In inflammatory lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), despite their increased numbers, macrophages demonstrate significantly reduced phagocytic capacity of bacteria and apoptotic cells. This defect could play a role in dysbiosis of the lung microbiome contributing to disease pathophysiology. In this review, we will discuss lung macrophages, describe phagocytosis and its related downstream processes and the reported phagocytosis defects in COPD. Finally, we will briefly examine current strategies that focus on restoring the phagocytic capabilities of lung macrophages that may have utility in COPD.",

These inflammatory caspases are activated within multi-protein complexes called inflammasomes that are assembled in response to invading pathogens and/or danger signals. Pyroptotic cell death was suggested to evolve via the formation of pores in the plasma membrane, but the exact mechanism underlying the formation of these pores remained unclear. Recently, gasdermin D, a member of the gasdermin protein family was identified as a caspase substrate and essential effector of pyroptosis, being identified as the protagonist of membrane pore formation. Gasdermins have emerged as a family of new class of cell death inducers, but many questions remain unanswered. Here, we present an overview of recent work being done in the area of programmed cell death and the latest evidence regarding the role and participation of gasdermin D as an effector of pyroptosis.",

Image acquisition of plates was performed with the BD Kiestra\u2122 ImagA BT digital imaging module using the BD Kiestra\u2122 Optis\u2122 imaging software. The algorithms were developed and trained using defined data sets and their performance evaluated on both defined and clinical samples.The detection algorithms exhibited 97.1% sensitivity and 93.6% specificity for microbial growth detection. Moreover, quantification accuracy of 80.2% and of 98.6% when accepting a 1 log tolerance was obtained with both defined monomicrobial and clinical urine samples, despite the presence of multiple species in the clinical samples. Automated identification accuracy of microbial colonies growing on chromogenic agar from defined isolates or clinical urine samples ranged from 98.3% to 99.7%, depending on the bacterial species tested.The development of intelligent algorithm represents a major innovation that has the potential to significantly increase laboratory quality and productivity while reducing turn-around-times. Further development and validation with larger numbers of defined and clinical samples should be performed before transferring intelligent imaging analysis into diagnostic laboratories.",

In this regard proposed article presents multimodal brain image registration and fusion for better neurosurgical planning.In proposed work brain data is acquired from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Computed Tomography (CT) modalities. CT and MRI images are pre-processed and given for image registration. BSpline deformable registration and multiresolution image registration is performed on the CT and MRI sequence. CT is fixed image and MRI is moving image for registration. Later end result is fusion of CT and registered MRI sequences.BSpline deformable registration is performed on the slices gave promising results but on the sequences noise have been introduced in the resultant image because of multimodal and multiresolution input images. Then multiresolution registration technique is performed on the CT and MRI sequence of the brain which gave promising results.The end resultant fused images are validated by the radiologists and mutual information measure is used to validate registration results. It is found that CT and MRI sequence with more number of slices gave promising results. Few cases with deformation during misregistrations recorded with low mutual information of about 0.3 and which is not acceptable and few recorded with 0.6 and above mutual information during registration gives promising results.",

Microalgae (MA) have been identified as a promising source for these bioactive compounds, and this work aimed to evaluate the anti-proliferative effects of semi-purified protein extracted from MA against several tumor cell lines.Tested samples comprised MA cell extracts treated with cellulase and lysozyme, prior to extraction. The effect of dialysis, required to remove unnecessary small molecules, was also tested. The anti-cancer efficacies of the dialyzed and undialyzed extracts were determined by measuring cell viability after treating four human cancer cell lines, specifically A549 (human lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma), MDA MB-435 (human melanoma), and LNCap (human prostate cancer cells derived from a metastatic site in the lymph node). This was compared to the effects of the agents on the human BPH-1\u00a0cell line (benign human prostate epithelial cells). The t-test was used to statistically analyze the results and determine the significance.Against LNCap and A549\u00a0cells, the performance of cellulase-treated extracts was better (with p-values <\u00a00.05, as compared to the control) than that of lysozyme-treated preparations (with p-values mainly > 0.05, as compared to the control); however, they had similar effects against the other two tumor cell lines (with p-values mainly < 0.05, as compared to the control). Moreover, based on their effect on BPH-1\u00a0cells, extracts from lysozyme-treated MA cells were determined to be safer against the benign prostate hyperplasia cells, BPH-1 (with p-values mainly > 0.05, as compared to the control). After dialysis, the performance of MA extracts from lysozyme-treated cells was enhanced significantly (with p-values dropping to < 0.05, as compared to the control).The results of this work provide important information and could provide the foundation for further research to incorporate MA constituents into pharmaceutical anti-cancer therapeutic formulations.",

Next, some statistical indices were calculated from the MP coefficients. Then, three dimensionality reduction methods, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Kernel PCA were applied. The dimensionality reduced features were fed into the Probabilistic Neural Network in subject-dependent and subject-independent modes. Emotion classes were described by a two-dimensional emotion space, including four quadrants of valence and arousal plane, valence based, and arousal based emotional states.Using PCA, the highest recognition rate of 100% was achieved for sigma\u00a0=\u00a00.01 in all classification schemes.

     "abstract": "Extracellular nucleotides have been recognized as important mediators of activation, triggering multiple responses via plasma membrane receptors known as P2 receptors. P2 receptors comprise P2X ionotropic receptors and G protein-coupled P2Y receptors. P2X receptors are expressed in many tissues, where they are involved in a number of functions including synaptic transmission, muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, inflammation, macrophage activation, differentiation and proliferation, neuropathic and inflammatory pain. P2X4 is one of the most sensitive purinergic receptors (at nanomolar ATP concentrations), about one thousand times more than the archetypal P2X7. P2X4 is widely expressed in central and peripheral neurons, in microglia, and also found in various epithelial tissues and endothelial cells. It localizes on the plasma membrane, but also in intracellular compartments. P2X4 is preferentially localized in lysosomes, where it is protected from proteolysis by its glycosylation. High ATP concentration in the lysosomes does not activate P2X4 at low pH; P2X4 gets activated by intra-lysosomal ATP only in its fully dissociated tetra-anionic form, when the pH increases to 7.4. Thus, P2X4 is functioning as a Ca2+-channel after the fusion of late endosomes and lysosomes. P2X4 modulates major neurotransmitter systems and regulates alcohol-induced responses in microglia. P2X4 is one of the key receptors mediating neuropathic pain. However, injury-induced upregulation of P2X4 expression is gender dependent and plays a key role in pain difference between males and females. P2X4 is also involved in inflammation. Extracellular ATP being a pro-inflammatory molecule, P2X4 can trigger inflammation in response to high ATP release. It is therefore involved in multiple pathologies, like post-ischemic inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, airways inflammation in asthma, neurodegenerative diseases and even metabolic syndrome. Although P2X4 remains poorly characterized, more studies are needed as it is likely to be a potential therapeutic target in these multiple pathologies.",

     "abstract": "Accumulating mutations may drive cells into the acquisition of abnormal phenotypes that are characteristic of cancer cells. Cancer cells feature profound alterations in proliferation programs that result in a new population of cells that overrides normal tissue construction and maintenance programs. To achieve this goal, cancer cells are endowed with up regulated survival signaling pathways. They also must counteract the cytotoxic effects of high levels of nitric oxide (NO) and of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are by products of cancer cell growth. Accumulating experimental evidence associates cancer cell survival with their capacity to up-regulate antioxidant systems. Elevated expression of the antioxidant protein thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) has been correlated with cancer development. Trx1 has been characterized as a multifunctional protein, playing different roles in different cell compartments. Trx1 migrates to the nucleus in cells exposed to nitrosative/oxidative stress conditions. Trx1 nuclear migration has been related to the activation of transcription factors associated with cell survival and cell proliferation. There is a direct association between the p21Ras-ERK1/2 MAP Kinases survival signaling pathway and Trx1 nuclear migration under nitrosative stress. The expression of the cytoplasmic protein, the thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), determines the change in Trx1 cellular compartmentalization. The anti-apoptotic actions of Trx1 and its denitrosylase activity occur in the cytoplasm and serve as important regulators of cell survival. Within this context, this review focuses on the participation of Trx1 in cells under nitrosative/oxidative stress in survival signaling pathways associated with cancer development.",

     "abstract": "Radiation therapy is one of the major therapeutic modalities for most solid tumors. The anti-tumor effect of radiation therapy consists of the direct tumor cell killing, as well as the modulation of tumor microenvironment and the activation of immune response against tumors. Radiation therapy has been shown to promote immunogenic cells death, activate dendritic cells and enhance tumor antigen presentation and anti-tumor T cell activation. Radiation therapy also programs innate immune cells such as macrophages that leads to either radiosensitization or radioresistance, according to different tumors and different radiation regimen studied. The mechanisms underlying radiation-induced macrophage activation remain largely elusive. Various molecular players such as NF-\u03baB, MAPKs, p53, reactive oxygen species, inflammasomes have been involved in these processes. The skewing to a pro-inflammatory phenotype thus results in the activation of anti-tumor immune response and enhanced radiotherapy effect. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of radiation-induced macrophage activation and its role in tumor response to radiation therapy is crucial for the development of new therapeutic strategies to enhance radiation therapy efficacy.",

By removing the need for life-long immunosuppression following engraftment, the adverse consequences of immunosuppressive regimens, including chronic infections and malignancy, may be avoided. Furthermore, autoimmune diseases and allergy are, by definition, driven by aberrant immunological responses to ordinarily innocuous antigens. The re-establishment of permanent tolerance towards instigating antigens may, therefore, provide a cure to these common diseases. Whilst various cell types exhibiting a tolerogenic phenotype have been proposed for such a task, tolerogenic dendritic cells (tol-DCs) are exquisitely adapted for antigen presentation and interact with many facets of the immune system: as such, they are attractive candidates for use in strategies for immune intervention. We review here our current understanding of tol-DC mediated induction and maintenance of immunological tolerance. Additionally, we discuss recent in\u00a0vitro findings from animal models and clinical trials of tol-DC immunotherapy in the setting of transplantation, autoimmunity and allergy which highlight their promising therapeutic potential, and speculate how tol-DC therapy may be developed in the future.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of our study is to use a noninvasive tomographic imaging technique with high spatial resolution to characterize and monitor biological tissue responses associated with laser thermal injury.Optical doppler tomography (ODT) combines laser doppler flowmetry (LDF) with optical coherence tomography (OCT) to obtain high resolution tomographic velocity and structural images of static and moving constituents in highly scattering biological tissues. A SurgiLase XJ150 carbon dioxide (CO2) laser using a continuous mode of 3\u00a0watts (W) was used to create first, second or third degree burns on anesthetized Sprague\u2013Dawley rats. Additional parameters for laser thermal injury were assessed as well.The rationale for using ODT in the evaluation of laser thermal injury offers a means of constructing a high resolution tomographic image of the structure and perfusion of laser damaged skin. In the velocity images, the blood flow is coded at 1300\u00a0\u03bcm/s and 0 velocity, 1000\u00a0\u03bcm/s and 0 velocity, 700\u00a0\u03bcm/s and 0 velocity adjacent to the first, second, and third degree injuries, respectively.ODT produces exceptional spatial resolution while having a non-invasive way of measurement, therefore, ODT is an accurate measuring method for high-resolution fluid flow velocity and structural images for biological tissue with laser thermal injury.",

Analysis of Abbreviated Injury Scale scores revealed that female patients sustained significantly higher rates of injuries to the extremities, but lower rates of injuries to the head/neck, face, and thorax than male patients did. Female patients had a significant lower Injury Severity Score (ISS) and adjusted odds ratio of in-hospital mortality (AOR 0.83, 95% CI: 0.83\u20130.86) after adjustment by ISS. However, the logistic regression analysis of propensity score-matched patients with adjusted confounders including helmet-wearing status and alcohol intoxication revealed that the gender did not significantly influence mortality (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.47\u20131.43; p\u00a0=\u00a00.475), implying the an associated risky behaviors may attribute to the difference of odds of mortality between the male and female patients.

     "abstract": "Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved process by which eukaryotic cells eliminate intracellular components via the lysosomal degradation process. This cell self-digestion process was first discovered and morphologically characterized in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The genetic screen studies in baker's yeast in the 1990s further identified the essential genes functioning in the autophagic process. In the past two decades, the detailed molecular process involved in the completion of autophagy was delineated. Additionally, autophagy has been implied to function in many aspects of biological processes, including maintenance of organelle integrity, protein quality control, regulation of the stress response, and immunity. In addition to maintain cell homeostasis, autophagy has recently been shown to be modulated and to participate in the pathogenesis of human diseases, such as pathogen infections, neurodegenerative diseases, and tumor development. Overall, the breakthrough in autophagy research relies on the discovery of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) using a genetic screening approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which was established by Yoshinori Ohsumi. This year the Nobel Committee has awarded Yoshinori Ohsumi the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his remarkable contribution to autophagy research.",

     "abstract": "Christian de Duve first coined the expression \u201cautophagy\u201d during his seminal work on the discovery of lysosomes, which led to him being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1974. The term was adopted to distinguish degradation of intracellular components from the uptake and degradation of extracellular substances that he called \u201cheterophagy\u201d. Studies until the 1990s were largely observational/morphological-based until in 1993 Yoshinori Oshumi described a genetic screen in yeast undergoing nitrogen deprivation that led to the isolation of autophagy-defective mutants now better known as ATG (AuTophaGy-related) genes. The screen identified mutants that fell into 15 complementation groups implying that at least 15 genes were involved in the regulation of autophagy in yeast undergoing nutrient deprivation, but today, 41 yeast ATG genes have been described and many (though not all) have orthologues in humans. Attempts to identify the genetic basis of autophagy led to an explosion in its research and it's not surprising that in 2016 Yoshinori Oshumi was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Our aim here is not to exhaustively review the ever-expanding autophagy literature (>60 papers per week), but to celebrate Yoshinori Oshumi's Nobel Prize by highlighting just a few aspects that are not normally extensively covered. In an accompanying mini-review we address the role of autophagy in early-diverging eukaryote parasites that like yeast, lack lysosomes and so use a digestive vacuole to degrade autophagosome cargo and also discuss how parasitized host cells react to infection by subverting regulation of autophagy.",

One of them is autophagy, a process involved in the degradation of the cell's own components. These intracellular parasites nonetheless seem to present a number of original features compared to their very evolutionarily distant host cells. In mammals and other metazoans, autophagy has been identified as an important contributor to the defence against microbial pathogens. Thus, host autophagy also likely plays a key role in the control of apicomplexan parasites, although its potential manipulation and subversion by intracellular parasites creates a complex interplay in the regulation of host and parasite autophagy. In this mini-review, we summarise current knowledge on autophagy in both parasites and their host cells, in the context of infection by three Apicomplexa: Plasmodium, Toxoplasma, and Theileria.",

To isolate bulge stem cell population, flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry using K15, CD34 and nestin biomarkers were performed. In order to accelerate the HFSCs differentiation into keratinocyte, HFSCs were treated with 10\u221212 M, 1,25(OH)2D3 every 48 h for a week.Immunocytochemistry results showed that bulge stem cells are nestin and CD34 positive but K15 negative before differentiation.

Health metrics indicate that the disease is related to an elevated number of years lost-to-disability and years lost-to-life. Schistosomiasis is an intravascular disease that is related to a Th1 and Th2 immune response polarization, and the degree of polarization affects the outcome of the disease. The purinergic system is composed of adenosine and nucleotides acting as key messenger molecules. Moreover, nucleotide-transforming enzymes and cell-surface purinergic receptors are obligatory partners of this purinergic signaling. In mammalian cells, purinergic signaling modulates innate immune responses and inflammation among other functions; conversely purinergic signaling may also be modulated by inflammatory mediators. Moreover, schistosomes also express some enzymes of the purinergic system, and it is possible that worms modulate host purinergic signaling. Current data obtained in murine models of schistosomiasis support the notion that the host purinergic system is altered by the disease. The dysfunction of adenosine receptors, metabotropic P2Y and ionotropic P2X7 receptors, and NTPDases likely contributes to disease morbidity.",

During infection, immune cells, antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, chemokines, and adaptive immunity evolve in the reproductive tract, and a proinflammatory response is generated to eliminate the invading extracellular pathogen Trichomonas vaginalis. However, the parasite has developed complex evolutionary mechanisms to evade the host immune response through cysteine proteases, phenotypic variation, and molecular mimicry. The purinergic system constitutes a signaling cellular net where nucleotides and nucleosides, enzymes, purinoceptors and transporters are involved in almost all cells and tissues signaling pathways, especially in central and autonomic nervous systems, endocrine, respiratory, cardiac, reproductive, and immune systems, during physiological as well as pathological processes.

However, whether LMP1 itself is sufficient to drive these events in immunocompetent hosts remains elusive due to the lack of appropriate experimental models. The aim of this study was to study LMP1-dependent tumorigenesis and metastasis in BALB/c mice inoculated with BALB/c-3T3 cells expressing N-LMP1 (a Taiwanese NPC variant).Following cancer cell inoculation, metastasis formation was monitored over time using PCR analysis of LMP1 as tumor marker. We also used a luciferase (Luc)-containing N-LMP1 and bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to monitor metastasis formation in a non-invasive manner.N-LMP1 appeared early in draining lymph nodes and in various distant organs before the rapid growth of the primary tumor. Lung metastasis was observed by BLI and further confirmed by histological examination. Furthermore, we detected luciferase signals in the lungs, even before the animals were sacrificed.Our results demonstrate the high metastatic character of N-LMP1 in immunocompetent hosts. Systemic tumor dissemination occurs even before aggressive tumor growth at the primary site, suggesting that early treatment of primary LMP1-associated tumors and distant micro-metastases is critical to achieve positive results.",

     "abstract": "Since the majority of morphological changes evaluation of myocardium in ischaemic heart disease was in animal model, we detected the importance to evaluate such changes in human patients to gain insights into the targets of cellular damage and to reconcile or refine those experiments.Tissue sections from left atrial appendage of the heart were carefully dissected from seventy five patients underwent conventional coronary artery bypass grafting at the cardiothoracic surgical department, Manchester Royal Infirmary. Tissue was fixed, sectioned, stained and six random sections were photographed and the images were assessed and quantified using Image Analyser Pro-Plus software, version 4.1. Arterioles, venules, intermediate sized vessels, and capillaries were directly counted within the highlighted area of myocardium under LM. Ultra-thin sections were imaged in a Tecnai 12 Biotwin transmission electron microscope at a magnification of \u00d74200 and photographed by a camera with a black and white film to quantify different structures of myocardium.The arteriole wall to lumen ratio was significantly increased in ischaemic heart disease patients 18.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.89 compared to controls 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.57, (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The regression analysis between vascular density and cardiomyocyte size demonstrated a significant inverse correlation between transverse cardiomyocyte diameter and arteriole, capillary and total vessel density (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01, 0.04, 0.02), respectively. Lumen area of the distal myocardial capillary was significantly reduced in IHD patients compared to controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).These results elucidate the morphological changes in the myocardial microvasculature of patients with ischaemic heart disease and its pathological magnitudes.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate safety and outcome of non-imaging assisted insertion of these catheters in internal jugular vein (IJV) for hemodialysis.We analyzed 233 attempts of non-imaging assisted un-cuffed, non-tunneled IJV catheterization at our center. The immediate insertion complications, duration of use, rate and type of infection and other complications were assessed.Out of the 233 attempts, 223 (213-right, 10-left) were successful. The most common indication was AKI (n\u00a0=\u00a0127, 54.5%), followed by CKD (n\u00a0=\u00a099, 42.5%). Successful catheterization at first attempt was achieved in 78.9%. Insertion complications were noted in 12.8% and included arterial puncture (5.2%), hematoma (3.0%) and malposition (2.1%). Amongst 219 catheters followed for 4825 days, the mean duration of use was 22 days. Catheter related infections occurred in 42 patients with an incidence of 8.7 per 1000 catheter days. Bacteraemia was present in 10/36 cases (27.7%), positive catheter tip cultures in 71.4% cases and staphylococcal species were the most common organism. Cumulative hazard analysis by Cox regression revealed a linear increase in the risk for infection with each week.Non-imaging assisted insertion of uncuffed, non-tunneled catheters is associated with slightly higher rate of insertion complication but comparable outcome in terms of infection rate or days of use.",

Driven by the unfolding of molecular biology and recent technological progress, the term has evolved significantly and shifted from a conceptual framework to a mechanistic understanding. This shift was accompanied by much hype and raised high hopes that epigenetics might hold both the key to deciphering the molecular underpinning of complex, non-Mendelian diseases and offer novel therapeutic approaches for a large panel of pathologies. However, while exciting reports of biological phenomena involving DNA methylation and histone modifications fill up the scientific literature, the realistic clinical applications of epigenetic medicines remain somewhat blurry.

Advances in OCT technology in signal detection technique from time-domain (TD) to spectral-domain (SD) detection have given us the potential to study various retinal layers more precisely and in less time. SD-OCT better delineates structural changes and fine lesions in the individual retinal layers. Thus, we have gained substantial information about the pathologic and structural changes in ocular conditions with primary or secondary retinal involvement.

However, the possible pathophysiological relation between TMDs and tinnitus is not generally investigated in clinical practice.The patterns and forces of occlusal contacts have been studied by means of T-scan III in 47 tinnitus patients (23 suffering from idiopathic tinnitus and 24 affected by M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease [MD]) and 13 healthy subjects.The center of force target was offset in the opposite direction in 15/23 idiopathic tinnitus and in 7/24 MD patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). No significant variation was found in the occlusal force.Our data suggest that a diagnostic screening method for occlusal stability in the intercuspidal position might be clinically useful in idiopathic tinnitus patients.",

After H. pylori enters the host stomach, four steps are critical for bacteria to establish successful colonization, persistent infection, and disease pathogenesis: (1) Survival in the acidic stomach; (2) movement toward epithelium cells by flagella-mediated motility; (3) attachment to host cells by adhesins/receptors interaction; (4) causing tissue damage by toxin release. Over the past 20 years, the understanding of H. pylori pathogenesis has been improved by studies focusing on the host and bacterial factors through epidemiology researches and molecular mechanism investigations. These include studies identifying the roles of novel virulence factors and their association with different disease outcomes, especially the bacterial adhesins, cag pathogenicity island, and vacuolating cytotoxin. Recently, the development of large-scale screening methods, including proteomic, and transcriptomic tools, has been used to determine the complex gene regulatory networks in H. pylori. In addition, a more available complete genomic database of H. pylori strains isolated from patients with different gastrointestinal diseases worldwide is helpful to characterize this bacterium.

Three approaches are envisaged: fetal globin gene reactivation by pharmacological compounds injected into patients throughout their lives, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and gene therapy. HSCT is currently the only treatment shown to provide an effective, definitive cure for \u03b2-thalassemia. However, this procedure remains risky and histocompatible donors are identified for only a small fraction of patients. New pharmacological compounds are being tested, but none has yet made it into common clinical practice for the treatment of beta-thalassemia major. Gene therapy is in the experimental phase. It is emerging as a powerful approach without the immunological complications of HSCT, but with other possible drawbacks.

We examined the combined effect of transforming growth factor-beta-1 (TGF-\u03b21) stimulation and contact with type I collagen on PTC transdifferentiation.Human kidney-2 cells were grown on type I substratum with the concurrent stimulation of TGF-\u03b21.Following addition of TGF-\u03b21, cells acquired an elongated fibroblastic appearance and an increase in \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) expression, a myofibroblastic marker. Upon addition of TGF-\u03b21, E-cadherin expression, an epithelial marker, was reduced, while cytokeratin expression, another epithelial marker, remained unaltered. Following removal of TGF-\u03b21, PTC regained an epithelial appearance and E-cadherin expression reverted to the unstimulated level, suggesting incomplete and reversible transdifferentiation. Addition of TGF-\u03b21 to cells grown on type I collagen demonstrated a cooperatively increased \u03b1-SMA expression and decreased E-cadherin and cytokeratin expressions, suggesting more complete transdifferentiation. Co-stimulation of TGF-\u03b21 and contact with type I collagen led to a stable cell phenotype and persistently decreased E-cadherin, which was not reversed upon removal of TGF-\u03b21, indicating irreversible transdifferentiation. Addition of TGF-\u03b21 or type I collagen caused a 4-fold increase in migratory cell number as compared to the control, whereas addition of both TGF-\u03b21 and type I collagen led to an 11-fold increase.TGF-\u03b21 alone results in a reversible and incomplete transdifferentiation. The combination of TGF-\u03b21 and exposure to type I collagen leads to an irreversible and complete PTC transdifferentiation.",

The objective of this study was to compare efficacy and tolerability of baclofen with chlordiazepoxide in uncomplicated AWS.Sixty subjects with uncomplicated AWS were randomized into two groups of 30 each, to receive baclofen (30\u00a0mg) or chlordiazepoxide (75\u00a0mg) in decremented fixed dose regime for 9 days. Clinical efficacy was assessed by Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised Scale (CIWA-Ar) and tolerability by the nature and severity of adverse events. Lorazepam was used as rescue medication. Secondary efficacy parameters were Clinical Global Impression scores, symptom-free days, and subject satisfaction as assessed by visual analog scale. This study was registered with Clinical Trial Registry-India (CTRI/2013/04/003588), also subsequently registered with WHO's ICTRP clinical trial portal.Both baclofen and chlordiazepoxide showed a consistent reduction in the total CIWA-Ar scores. However, chlordiazepoxide showed a faster and a more effective control of anxiety and agitation requiring lesser lorazepam supplementation, and also showed a better subject satisfaction compared to baclofen. Both the drugs showed good tolerability with mild self-limiting adverse events.The present study demonstrates that baclofen is not as good as chlordiazepoxide in the treatment of uncomplicated AWS.

     "abstract": "Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are growing public health problems. Despite having different pathophysiologies, both diseases are associated with defects in immune regulation. Invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells are innate-like T cells that recognize glycolipids presented by CD1d. These cells not only play a key role in the defense against pathogens, but also exert potent immunoregulatory functions. The regulatory role of iNKT cells in the prevention of type 1 diabetes has been demonstrated in murine models and analyzed in diabetic patients. The decreased frequency of iNKT cells in non-obese diabetic mice initially suggested the regulatory role of this cell subset. Increasing the frequency or the activation of iNKT cells with agonists protects non-obese diabetic mice from the development of diabetes. Several mechanisms mediate iNKT regulatory functions. They can rapidly produce immunoregulatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10. They induce tolerogenic dendritic cells, thereby inducing the anergy of autoreactive anti-islet T cells and increasing the frequency of T regulatory cells (Treg cells). Synthetic agonists are able to activate iNKT cells and represent potential therapeutic treatment in order to prevent type 1 diabetes. Growing evidence points to a role of immune system in glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes. iNKT cells are resident cells of adipose tissue and their local and systemic frequencies are reduced in obese patients, suggesting their involvement in local and systemic inflammation during obesity. With the discovery of potential continuity between type 1 and type 2 diabetes in some patients, the role of iNKT cells in these diseases deserves further investigation.",

This study was undertaken to evaluate the diagnostic utility of TBSRTC for reporting thyroid FNACs and rate of malignancy in each diagnostic category of TBSRTC.A total of 603 thyroid FNAC results were retrieved retrospectively between July 2012 and January 2015 and reclassified according to TBSRTC. Of these, 392 cases had a histopathological follow-up. The FNACs results were compared to the histopathological diagnoses and the malignancy rates of each diagnostic categories of TBSRTC were calculated.Of the 603 FNACs, nondiagnostic were 16 (2.7%), benign were 393 (65.2%), atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS) were 60 (10%), follicular neoplasm/suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN) were 64 (10.6%), suspicious for malignancy (SM) were 32 (5.3%), and malignant were 38 (6.3%). In 392 cases, there was follow-up histopathology. The malignancy rate for nondiagnostic, benign, AUS/FLUS, FN/SFN, SM, and malignant categories were 0%, 0.8%, 24.4%, 28.9%, 70.8%, and 100%, respectively.Our study validated the efficacy of TBSRTC. In conclusion, the malignancy rate of AUS/FLUS in this study was higher than the risk mentioned in TBSRTC and other published studies. Hence, AUS/FLUS category patients in our setup warrant further workup including ultrasound and/or thyroid scan in addition to immediate repeat FNAC.",

     "abstract": "Osteonectin (OSN) plays a pivotal role in cardiac remodeling, but predictive value for OSN in ischemic chronic heart failure (CHF) has not been defined. The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic value of OSN for cumulative survival and hospitalization among patients with ischemic-induced CHF.A total of 154 patients with ischemic symptomatic moderate-to-severe CHF were enrolled in the study at discharge from the hospital. Observation period was up to 3 years (156 weeks). Blood samples for biomarkers measurements were collected at baseline prior to study entry. ELISA methods for measurements of circulating level of OSN were used.During a median follow-up of 2.18 years, 21 participants died and 106 subjects were re-admitted. Medians of circulating levels of OSN in survival and died patient cohorts were 670.96\u00a0ng/mL (95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a0636.53\u2013705.35\u00a0ng/mL) and 907.84\u00a0ng/mL (95% CI\u00a0=\u00a0878.02\u2013937.60\u00a0ng/mL). Receiver operation characteristic curve analysis has shown that cut off point of OSN concentration for cumulative survival function was 845.15\u00a0ng/mL. It has been found a significant divergence of Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves in patients with high (>845.15\u00a0ng/mL) and low (<845.15\u00a0ng/mL) concentrations of OSN. Circulating OSN independently predicted all-cause mortality (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a01.23; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.10\u20131.36; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), CHF-related death (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.46; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.22\u20131.80; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and also CHF-related re-admission (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.92; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.77\u20132.45; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) within 3 years of observation period.Increased circulating secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine family member OSN associates with increased 3-year CHF-related death, all-cause mortality, and risk for recurrent hospitalization due to CHF.",

     "abstract": "Reconsidering when to initiate renal replacement therapy (RRT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has been emphasized recently. With evolving modern aged and diabetes-prone populations, conventional markers of uremia are not sufficient for determining the optimal timing for dialysis initiation. This retrospective cohort study examined the association between hyperphosphatemia and uremic patients who need RRT registration.All patients from the department of nephrology in one tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan who had advanced CKD and estimated glomerular filtration rates <8\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m2 from July 2009 to May 2013 were enrolled. We reviewed the medical records and collected data on demographics, comorbidities, underlying diseases, duration of nephrology care, use of phosphate binders, and laboratory results. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify factors associated with hemodialysis initiation decision making.During the study period, 209 of 292 patients with advanced CKD were enrolled in hemodialysis program and 83 patients (controls) were not. Univariable analysis indicated that male sex, current smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, high serum creatinine level, and high serum phosphate level were associated with initiation of hemodialysis. Multivariable analysis indicated that those with higher serum phosphate level (odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u00a02.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]\u00a0=\u00a01.6\u20133.5, p\u00a0=\u00a01.4\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22125) and being in nephrology care for <12 months (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.4, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.2\u20130.8, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) tended to be significant markers for hemodialysis initiation.Hyperphosphatemia, in addition to conventional laboratory markers and uremic symptoms, may be a useful marker to determine timing of hemodialysis initiation in patients with advanced CKD.",

     "abstract": "Ceramic-on-ceramic (COC) total hip arthroplasty (THA) has gained popularity since improvements in wear characteristics and longevity. Whether large ceramic femoral heads (\u226536\u00a0mm) have increased postoperative range of motion (ROM) and a lower dislocation rate is not clear. This study aimed to compare functional outcomes and early complications between large-head (\u226536\u00a0mm) and smaller-head (\u226432\u00a0mm) COC prostheses with a minimum follow-up of 12 months.A total of 95 consecutive uncemented COC THAs were performed in 90 patients between January 2012 and July 2013. Of these, 49 patients (smaller-head group) received third generation and 41 patients (large-head group) received fourth generation COC prostheses. Harris hip score (HHS), Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis index (WOMAC), and ROM of the hip pre- and post-operatively were compared, as well as the presence of early complications.Postoperative HHSs (88.4 vs. 89.3, p\u00a0=\u00a00.34) and WOMAC scores (12.0 vs. 11.0, p\u00a0=\u00a00.111) were not different between the groups. Postoperative flexion ROM was lower in the smaller-head group (98.8\u00b0 vs. 106.1\u00b0, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but there were no differences in extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. One patient in each group reported a grinding noise. There was one dislocation (1.9%) in the smaller-head group, and none in the large-head group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.371). No infections or loosening of the components occurred.Large-head COC articulation provided better flexion, but functional outcomes and early complications are similar to the smaller-head COC.",

     "abstract": "Postgraduate year training programs play an important role in the development of a comprehensive medical education. The goal of these training programs is to inculcate in physicians the expected level of skill in patient care. After the initiation of such programs in the USA, Europe, and Japan, studies were conducted in Taiwan to investigate relevant training methods, and a training system was established in 2003. Beginning with 3-month programs, followed by 6-month programs, the programs were constantly modified and enhanced by the establishment of the 1-year training program in 2011. This year was the transition period from the 6-month programs to the 1-year programs.We used a 50-item multiple choice question (MCQ) test and six 10-min stations for objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), which was composed of four stations relating to standardized patients and two stations concerning the clinical skill evaluation, to evaluate the learning results of the trainees. The trainees were divided into four groups according to the training program.There was no significant difference between the performance of the 6 months and 1-year groups. The p values were 0.424 in the MCQ test and 0.082 in the OSCE evaluation.A well-designed postgraduate training program should develop trainees\u2019 competencies. The results of this study may provide useful insight for ways to improve the design of training programs. Further investigation to better understand the impact of different programs is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Primary laryngeal aspergillosis is extremely rare, especially in an immunocompetent host. It is commonly found as a part of systemic infection in immunocompromised patients. A case of vocal cord aspergillosis with no systemic extension in an immunocompetent patient on long-term steroid metered dose inhaler (MDI) is presented here, because of its rarity. The present case is a 28-year-old asthmatic female who was on inhalational steroid for 8 years, presented with sudden onset of severe dysphonia for 5 days. Fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated whitish plaque involving right vocal cord, clinically suggestive of fungal laryngitis. Microlaryngeal laser surgery was performed with stripping of the plaque. Histopathology demonstrated ulcerated hyperplastic squamous epithelium with masses of fungal hyphae, which was confirmed to be Aspergillus species on fungal culture. This rare but serious adverse effect of long-term steroid MDI use must be kept in mind while treating an asthmatic patient. We also present a brief review of literature of laryngeal aspergillosis.",

These disorders are mostly inherited and have characteristic age and muscle group predilection. Lingual muscle involvement is an unusual feature in patients with the muscular dystrophy and helps in the differential diagnosis. We recently encountered a serving soldier presenting with complaints of bilateral ptosis and dysphagia of 5 years duration. Examination showed bilateral ptosis, percussion myotonia, generalized muscular atrophy including that of tongue muscles, and a characteristic hatchet facies. Investigations revealed elevated creatine kinase and myotonic discharges on electromyography leading to a diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 1. Muscular dystrophy has a varied presentation and can pose a diagnostic problem in clinical practice. We present the case to highlight the differential diagnosis of tongue atrophy in patients with muscular dystrophy.",
