     "abstract": "Sterile inflammation is a therapeutic target in many diseases where it represents an important initiator of disease progression. However, the detailed mechanisms underlying its evolution and biological relevance are not yet completely elucidated. Biglycan, a prototype extracellular matrix-derived damage-associated molecular pattern, mediates sterile inflammation in macrophages through Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and/or TLR4-dependent signaling pathways. Here we discovered that soluble biglycan is a novel high-affinity ligand for CD14, a well-known GPI-anchored co-receptor for TLRs. CD14 is required for all biglycan-mediated TLR2/4 dependent inflammatory signaling pathways in macrophages. By binding to CD14 and choosing different TLR signaling branches, biglycan induced TNF-\u03b1 and CCL2 via TLR2/4, HSP70 through TLR2, and CCL5 via TLR4. Mechanistically, biglycan evoked phosphorylation and subsequent nuclear translocation of p38, p44/42, and NF-\u03baB, and these effects were due to a specific, high-affinity interaction between biglycan protein core and CD14. Finally, we provide proof-of-principle for the requirement of CD14, by transiently overexpressing biglycan in a mouse model of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury performed in Cd14\u2212/\u2212 mice. Lack of Cd14 prevented biglycan-mediated cytokine expression, recruitment of macrophages, M1 macrophage polarization as well as mitigated the tubular damage and serum creatinine levels, thereby improving renal function. Thus, CD14 inhibition could lead to the reduction in the activation of biglycan-TLR2/4 signaling pathways and could be a novel therapeutic approach in inflammatory kidney diseases.",

     "abstract": "Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells reside in the hypoxic niche of the intervertebral disc. Studies have demonstrated that RNA-binding protein HuR modulates hypoxic signaling in several cancers, however, its function in the disc is unknown. HuR did not show cytoplasmic translocation in hypoxia and its silencing did not alter levels of Hif-1\u03b1 or HIF-targets in NP cells. RNA-Sequencing data revealed that important extracellular matrix-related genes including several collagens, MMPs, aggrecan, Tgf-\u03b23 and Sdc4 were regulated by HuR. Further analysis of HuR-silenced NP cells confirmed that HuR maintained expression of these matrix genes. We confirmed decreased levels of secreted collagen I and Sdc4 and increased pro-MMP13 in HuR-knockdown cells. In addition, messenger ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation demonstrated HuR binding to Tgf-\u03b23 and Sdc4 mRNAs. Interestingly, while HuR bound to Hif-1\u03b1 and Vegf mRNAs, it was clear that compensatory mechanisms sustained their expression when HuR was silenced. Noteworthy, despite the presence of multiple HuR-binding sites and reported interaction in other cell types, HuR showed no binding to Pgk1, Eno1, Pdk1 and Pfkfb3 in NP cells. Metabolic studies showed a significant decrease in the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and acidic pH in HuR-silenced NP cells, without appreciable change in total OCR. These changes were likely due to decreased Ca12 expression in HuR silenced cells. Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time that HuR regulates extracellular matrix (ECM) and pH homeostasis of NP cells and has important implications in the maintenance of intervertebral disc health.",

     "abstract": "The \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin has been shown to promote aggressive phenotypes in many types of cancers, including prostate cancer. We show that GFP-labeled \u03b1v\u03b23 derived from cancer cells circulates in the blood and is detected in distant lesions in NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. We, therefore, hypothesized that \u03b1v\u03b23 travels through exosomes and tested its levels in pools of vesicles, which we designate extracellular vesicles highly enriched in exosomes (ExVs), and in exosomes isolated from the plasma of prostate cancer patients. Here, we show that the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin is found in patient blood exosomes purified by sucrose or iodixanol density gradients. In addition, we provide evidence that the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin is transferred through ExVs isolated from prostate cancer patient plasma to \u03b23-negative recipient cells. We also demonstrate the intracellular localization of \u03b23-GFP transferred via cancer cell-derived ExVs. We show that the ExVs present in plasma from prostate cancer patients contain higher levels of \u03b1v\u03b23 and CD9 as compared to plasma ExVs from age-matched subjects who are not affected by cancer. Furthermore, using PSMA antibody-bead mediated immunocapture, we show that the \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin is expressed in a subset of exosomes characterized by PSMA, CD9, CD63, and an epithelial-specific marker, Trop-2. Finally, we present evidence that the levels of \u03b1v\u03b23, CD63, and CD9 remain unaltered in ExVs isolated from the blood of prostate cancer patients treated with enzalutamide. Our results suggest that detecting exosomal \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin in prostate cancer patients could be a clinically useful and non-invasive biomarker to follow prostate cancer progression. Moreover, the ability of \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin to be transferred from ExVs to recipient cells provides a strong rationale for further investigating the role of \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer and as a potential therapeutic target.",

     "abstract": "It is now well recognized that heparanase, an endo-\u03b2-D-glucuronidase capable of cleaving heparan sulfate (HS) side chains at a limited number of sites, promotes tumorigenesis by diverse mechanisms. Compelling evidence strongly implies that heparanase is a viable target for cancer therapy, thus encouraging the development of heparanase inhibitors as anti-cancer therapeutics. Here, we examined the efficacy and mode of action of PG545, an HS-mimetic heparanase inhibitor, in human lymphoma. We found that PG545 exhibits a strong anti-lymphoma effect, eliciting lymphoma cell apoptosis. Notably, this anti-lymphoma effect involves ER stress response that was accompanied by increased autophagy. The persistent ER stress evoked by PG545 is held responsible for cell apoptosis because apoptotic cell death was attenuated by an inhibitor of PERK, a molecular effector of ER stress. Importantly, PG545 had no such apoptotic effect on na\u00efve splenocytes, further encouraging the development of this compound as anti-lymphoma drug. Surprisingly, we found that PG545 also elicits apoptosis in lymphoma cells that are devoid of heparanase activity (i.e., Raji), indicating that the drug also exerts heparanase-independent function(s) that together underlie the high potency of PG545 in preclinical cancer models.",

     "publication date": "04-2019",
     "abstract": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are essential signalling molecules involved in developmental and pathological processes and are regulated in the matrix by secreted glycoproteins. One such regulator is BMP-binding endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER) which can both inhibit and enhance BMP signalling in a context and concentration-dependent manner. Twisted gastrulation (Tsg) can also promote or ablate BMP activity but it is unclear whether Tsg and BMPER directly interact and thereby exert a synergistic function on BMP signalling. Here, we show that human BMPER binds to Tsg through the N-terminal BMP-binding region which alone more potently inhibits BMP-4 signalling than full-length BMPER. Additionally, BMPER and Tsg cooperatively inhibit BMP-4 signalling suggesting a synergistic function to dampen BMP activity. Furthermore, full-length BMPER is targeted to the plasma membrane via binding of its C-terminal region to cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycans but the active cleavage fragment is diffusible. Small-angle X-ray scattering and electron microscopy show that BMPER has an elongated conformation allowing the N-terminal BMP-binding and C-terminal cell-interactive regions to be spatially separated. To gain insight into the regulation of BMPER bioavailability by internal cleavage, a disease-causing BMPER point mutation, P370L, previously identified in the acid-catalysed cleavage site, was introduced. The mutated protein was secreted but the mutation prevented intracellular cleavage resulting in a lack of bioactive cleavage fragment. Furthermore, mutant BMPER was extracellularly cleaved at a downstream site presumably becoming available due to the mutation. This susceptibility to extracellular proteases and loss of bioactive N-terminal cleavage fragment may result in loss of BMPER function in disease.",

     "abstract": "The Hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway plays important roles during embryonic development and in adult tissue homeostasis, for example cartilage, where its deregulation can lead to osteoarthritis (OA). microRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression, and have been implicated in the regulation of signalling pathways, including Hh, thereby impacting upon development and disease. Our aim was to identify the function of miRNAs whose expression is altered in OA cartilage. Here we identified an increase in miR-324-5p expression in OA cartilage and hypothesised that, as in glioma, miR-324-5p would regulate Hh signalling. We determined that miR-324-5p regulates osteogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and in mouse C3H10T1/2 cells. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that miR-324-5p directly regulated established targets GLI1 and SMO in human but not in mouse, suggesting species-dependent mechanism of Hh pathway regulation. Stable Isotope Labelling with Amino acids in Cell culture (SILAC), mass spectrometry and whole genome transcriptome analysis identified Glypican 1 (Gpc1) as a novel miR-324-5p target in mouse, which was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR, immunoblotting and 3\u2032UTR-luciferase reporters. Knockdown of Gpc1 reduced Hh pathway activity, and phenocopied the effect of miR-324-5p on osteogenesis, indicating that miR-324-5p regulates Hh signalling in mouse via direct targeting of Gpc1. Finally, we showed that human GPC1 is not a direct target of miR-324-5p. Importantly, as well as identifying novel regulation of Indian Hedgehog (Ihh) signalling, this study demonstrates how a miRNA can show conserved pathway regulation in two species but by distinct mechanisms and highlights important differences between human diseases and mouse models.",

     "abstract": "Integrins, the major receptors for cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions, regulate multiple cell biological processes including adhesion, migration, proliferation and growth factor-dependent signaling. The principal laminin (LM) binding integrins \u03b13\u03b21, \u03b16\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 are usually co-expressed in cells and bind to multiple laminins with different affinities making it difficult to define their specific function. In this study, we generated kidney epithelial collecting duct (CD) cells that lack both the \u03b13 and \u03b16 integrin subunits. This deletion impaired cell adhesion and migration to LM-332 and LM-511 more than deleting \u03b13 or \u03b16 alone. Cell adhesion mediated by both \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16 integrins was PI3K independent, but required K63-linked polyubiquitination of Akt by the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme TRAF6. Moreover, we provide evidence that glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 10 (FGF10)- mediated cell signaling, spreading and proliferation were severely compromised in double integrin \u03b13/\u03b16- but not single \u03b13- or \u03b16-null CD cells. Interestingly, these growth factor-dependent cell functions required both PI3K- and TRAF6-dependent Akt activation. These data suggest that expression of the integrin \u03b13 or \u03b16 subunit is sufficient to mediate GDNF- and FGF10-dependent spreading, proliferation and signaling on LM-511. Thus, our study shows that \u03b13 and \u03b16 containing integrins promote distinct functions and signaling by CD cells on laminin substrata.",

     "abstract": "Mutations in the secreted metalloproteinase ADAMTS10 cause recessive Weill-Marchesani syndrome (WMS), comprising ectopia lentis, short stature, brachydactyly, thick skin and cardiac valve anomalies. Dominant WMS caused by FBN1 mutations is clinically similar and affects fibrillin-1 microfibrils, which are a major component of the ocular zonule. ADAMTS10 was previously shown to enhance fibrillin-1 assembly in vitro. Here, Adamts10 null mice were analyzed to determine the impact of ADAMTS10 deficiency on fibrillin microfibrils in vivo. An intragenic lacZ reporter identified widespread Adamts10 expression in the eye, musculoskeletal tissues, vasculature, skin and lung. Adamts10\u2212/\u2212 mice had reduced viability on the C57BL/6 background, and although surviving mice were slightly smaller and had stiff skin, they lacked brachydactyly and cardiovascular defects. Ectopia lentis was not observed in Adamts10\u2212/\u2212 mice, similar to Fbn1\u2212/\u2212 mice, most likely because the mouse zonule contains fibrillin-2 in addition to fibrillin-1. Unexpectedly, in contrast to wild-type eyes, Adamts10\u2212/\u2212 zonule fibers were thicker and immunostained strongly with fibrillin-2 antibodies into adulthood, whereas fibrillin-1 staining was reduced. Furthermore, fibrillin-2 staining of hyaloid vasculature remnants persisted post-natally in Adamts10\u2212/\u2212 eyes. ADAMTS10 was found to cleave fibrillin-2, providing an explanation for persistence of fibrillin-2 at these sites. Thus, analysis of Adamts10\u2212/\u2212 mice led to identification of fibrillin-2 as a novel ADAMTS10 substrate and defined a proteolytic mechanism for clearance of ocular fibrillin-2 at the end of the juvenile period.",

When the BMs of neighboring tissues come into contact, they usually slide along one another and act to separate tissues and organs into distinct compartments. However, in certain specialized regions, the BMs of neighboring tissues link, helping to bring tissues together. These BM connections can be transient, such as during tissue fusion events in development, or long-term, as with adult tissues involved with filtration, including the blood brain barrier and kidney glomerulus. The transitory nature of these connections in development and the complexity of tissue filtration systems in adults have hindered the understanding of how juxtaposed BMs fasten together. The recent identification of a BM-BM adhesion system in C. elegans, termed B-LINK (BM linkage), however, is revealing cellular and extracellular matrix components of a nascent tissue adhesion system.

     "abstract": "Basement membrane plays a foundational role in the structure and maintenance of many tissues throughout the animal kingdom. In addition to signaling to cells through cell-surface receptors, basement membrane directly influences the development and maintenance of organ shape via its mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of basement membrane are dictated by its composition, geometry, and crosslinking. Distinguishing between the ways the basement membrane influences morphology in vivo poses a major challenge. Drosophila melanogaster, already established as a powerful model for the analysis of cell signaling, has in recent years emerged as a tractable model for understanding the roles of basement membrane stiffness in vivo, in shaping and maintaining the morphology of tissues and organs. In addition to the plethora of genetic tools available in flies, the major proteins found in vertebrate basement membranes are all present in Drosophila. Furthermore, Drosophila has fewer copies of the genes encoding these proteins, making flies more amenable to genetic manipulation than vertebrate models. Because the development of Drosophila organs has been well-characterized, these different organ systems offer a variety of contexts for analyzing the role of basement membrane in development. The developing egg chamber and central nervous system, for example, have been important models for assessing the role of basement membrane stiffness in influencing organ shape. Studies in the nervous system have also shown how basement membrane stiffness can influence cellular migration in vivo. Finally, work in the imaginal wing disc has illuminated a distinct mechanism by which basement membrane can alter organ shape and size, by sequestering signaling ligands. This mini-review highlights the recent discoveries pertaining to basement membrane mechanics during Drosophila development.",

Basement membranes (BMs) are specialized ECM structures that provide tissues with structural cohesion and serve as a major extracellular signaling platform. While the embryonic formation of BM has been extensively investigated, its regeneration in adults remains poorly studied. We therefore focused on BM gene expression kinetics and showed that it recapitulates many aspects of development. As such, the re-expression of the embryonic col14a1a gene indicated that col14a1a is part of the regeneration-specific program. We showed that laminins and col14a1a genes display similar kinetics and that the corresponding proteins are spatially and temporally controlled during regeneration. Analysis of our CRISPR/Cas9-mediated col14a1a knockout fish showed that collagen XIV-A contributes to timely deposition of laminins. As changes in ECM organization can affect tissue mechanical properties, we analyzed the biomechanics of col14a1a\u2212/\u2212 regenerative BM using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our data revealed a thinner BM accompanied by a substantial increase of the stiffness when compared to controls. Further AFM 3D-reconstructions showed that BM is organized as a checkerboard made of alternation of soft and rigid regions that is compromised in mutants leading to a more compact structure. We conclude that collagen XIV-A transiently acts as a molecular spacer responsible for BM structure and biomechanics possibly by helping laminins integration within regenerative BM.",

A yeast two-hybrid screen to identify lysyl oxidase (LOX) binding proteins identified ADAMTSL4 as a potential interactor. We demonstrate here that several members of the LOX and ADAMTS families interact with one another. Upon investigating the interaction between LOX and ADAMTSL2 we found that the absence or inhibition of Lox affected ADAMTSL2 molecular forms and reduced its tissue levels. Thus, ADAMTSL2 stability and inter-molecular complexes may depend on the activity of lysyl oxidases.",

Found at low levels in healthy skin, GzmB is dramatically elevated in chronic disease and inflammatory skin disorders, including diabetic ulcers, hypertrophic scarring, autoimmune skin disorders, cutaneous leishmaniasis and aging skin. Traditionally known for its pro-apoptotic function, the role of GzmB in disease has been redefined due to the discovery of additional activities involving the cleavage of extracellular matrix proteins, epithelial barrier disruption, fibrosis, vascular permeability, anoikis, inflammation and autoimmunity. In addition to the accumulation of GzmB+ cells in diseased tissue, and critical to the mechanistic redefinition, is the realization that GzmB often accumulates in the extracellular milieu, retains its activity in plasma, and is expressed by both immune and non-immune cells that may or may not express perforin, the pore-forming protein required for GzmB internalization into target cells. As GzmB is not normally found in the extracellular milieu, and does not appear to be regulated, GzmB-mediated proteolysis can impact processes such as tissue remodelling, barrier function, autoantigen generation and angiogenesis. The present review will summarize and critically examine the current knowledge regarding GzmB in inflammatory skin disease, providing an overview of both apoptotic and extracellular mechanisms, but with a focus on the extracellular roles of GzmB in skin health and disease.",

Their interactions with matrix effectors, cell surface receptors and enzymes enable them with unique properties. In malignancy, extensive remodeling of tumor stroma is associated with marked alterations in proteoglycans' expression and structural variability. Proteoglycans exert diverse functions in tumor stroma in a cell-specific and context-specific manner and they mainly contribute to the formation of a permissive provisional matrix for tumor growth affecting tissue organization, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions and tumor cell signaling. Proteoglycans also modulate cancer cell phenotype and properties, the development of drug resistance and tumor stroma angiogenesis.

A number of novel functions have been recently assigned to TSP-4 in cardiovascular and nervous systems, inflammation, cancer, and the motor unit, which have attracted attention to this extracellular matrix (ECM) protein. These newly discovered functions set TSP-4 apart from other thrombospondins. For example, TSP-4 promotes angiogenesis while other TSPs either prevent it or have no effect on new blood vessel growth; TSP-4 reduces fibrosis and collagen production while TSP-1 and TSP-2 promote fibrosis in several organs; unlike other TSPs, TSP-4 appears to have some structural functions in ECM. The current information about TSP-4 functions in different organs and physiological systems suggests that this evolutionary conserved protein is a major regulator of the extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and production and tissue remodeling during the embryonic development and response to injury. In this review article, we summarize the properties and functions of TSP-4 and discuss its role in tissue remodeling.",

     "abstract": "Cutaneous wound healing consists of three main phases: inflammation, re-epithelialization, and tissue remodeling. During normal wound healing, these processes are tightly regulated to allow restoration of skin function and biomechanics. In many instances, healing leads to an excess accumulation of fibrillar collagen (the principal protein found in the extracellular matrix - ECM), and the formation of scar tissue, which has compromised biomechanics, tested using ramp to failure tests, compared to normal skin (Corr and Hart, 2013 [1]). Alterations in collagen accumulation and architecture have been attributed to the reduced tensile strength found in scar tissue (Brenda et al., 1999; Eleswarapu et al., 2011). Defining mechanisms that govern cellular functionality and ECM remodeling are vital to understanding normal versus pathological healing and developing approaches to prevent scarring. CD44 is a cell surface adhesion receptor expressed on nearly all cell types present in dermis. Although CD44 has been implicated in an array of inflammatory and fibrotic processes such as leukocyte recruitment, T-cell extravasation, and hyaluronic acid (the principal glycosaminoglycan found in the ECM) metabolism, the role of CD44 in cutaneous wound healing and scarring remains unknown. We demonstrate that in an excisional biopsy punch wound healing model, CD44-null mice have increased inflammatory and reduced fibrogenic responses during early phases of wound healing. At wound closure, CD44-null mice exhibit reduced collagen degradation leading to increased accumulation of fibrillar collagen, which persists after wound closure leading to reduced tensile strength resulting in a more severe scarring phenotype compared to WT mice. These data indicate that CD44 plays a previously unknown role in fibrillar collagen accumulation and wound healing during the injury response.",

     "abstract": "Ectopic calcification occurs during development of chronic kidney disease and has a negative impact on long-term prognosis. The precise molecular mechanism and prevention strategies, however, are not established. Fibulin-7 (Fbln7) is a matricellular protein structurally similar to elastogenic short fibulins, shown to bind dental mesenchymal cells and heparin. Here, we report that Fbln7 is highly expressed in renal tubular epithelium in the adult kidney and mediates renal calcification in mice. In vitro analysis revealed that Fbln7 bound heparin at the N-terminal coiled-coil domain. In Fbln7-expressing CHO-K1 cells, exogenous heparin increased the release of Fbln7 into conditioned media in a dose-dependent manner. This heparin-induced Fbln7 release was abrogated in CHO-745 cells lacking heparan sulfate proteoglycan or in CHO-K1 cells expressing the Fbln7 mutant lacking the N-terminal coiled-coil domain, suggesting that Fbln7 was tethered to pericellular matrix via this domain. Interestingly, Fbln7 knockout (Fbln7\u2212/\u2212) mice were protected from renal tubular calcification induced by high phosphate diet. Mechanistically, Fbln7 bound artificial calcium phosphate particles (aCPP) implicated in calcification and renal inflammation. Binding was decreased significantly in Fbln7\u2212/\u2212 primary kidney cells relative to wild-type cells. Further, overexpression of Fbln7 increased binding to aCPP. Addition of heparin reduced binding between aCPP and wild-type cells to levels of Fbln7\u2212/\u2212 cells. Taken together, our study suggests that Fbln7 is a local mediator of calcium deposition and that releasing Fbln7 from the cell surface by heparin/heparin derivatives or Fbln7 inhibitory antibodies may provide a novel strategy to prevent ectopic calcification in vivo.",

Intra-vital microscopic imaging of the microvasculature of the cremaster muscle combined with electron microscopic imaging of the microvasculature of the cardiac muscle uncovered the significance of SPARC in maintaining endothelial glycocalyx integrity and subsequent barrier properties to stop inflammation. Moreover, systemic administration of recombinant SPARC restored the endothelial glycocalyx and consequently reversed the increase in inflammation and mortality observed in SPARC KO mice in response to viral exposure. Reducing the glycocalyx in vivo by systemic administration of hyaluronidase, an enzyme that degrades the endothelial glycocalyx, mimicked the barrier defects found in SPARC KO mice, which could be restored by subsequent administration of recombinant SPARC.In conclusion, the secreted glycoprotein SPARC protects against adverse cardiac inflammation and mortality by improving the glycocalyx function and resulting endothelial barrier function during viral myocarditis.",

Notably, de novo expression of serglycin in low aggressive estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1)-positive MCF7 breast cancer cells promotes an aggressive phenotype. In this study, we discovered that serglycin promoted epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) in MCF7 cells as shown by increased expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin, fibronectin and EMT-related transcription factor Snail2. These phenotypic traits were also associated with the development of drug resistance toward various chemotherapy agents and induction of their proteolytic potential as shown by the increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases, including MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, MT1-MMP and up-regulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator. Knockdown of serglycin markedly reduced the expression of these proteolytic enzymes in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, serglycin expression was closely linked to a pro-inflammatory gene signature including the chemokine IL-8 in ER\u03b1-negative breast cancer cells and tumors. Notably, serglycin regulated the secretion of IL-8 in breast cancer cells independently of their ER\u03b1 status and promoted their proliferation, migration and invasion by triggering IL-8/CXCR2 downstream signaling cascades including PI3K, Src and Rac activation. Thus, serglycin promotes the establishment of a pro-inflammatory milieu in breast cancer cells that evokes an invasive mesenchymal phenotype via autocrine activation of IL-8/CXCR2 signaling axis.",

     "abstract": "Metastatic melanoma is highly fatal. Within the tumor microenvironment, the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in melanoma metastasis and progression is relatively understudied. The matricellular protein CCN2 (formerly termed connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) is overexpressed, in a fashion independent of BRAF mutational status, by CAFs in melanoma. Herein, we find, in human melanoma patients, that CCN2 expression negatively correlates with survival and positively correlates with expression of neovascularization markers. To assess the role of CAFs in melanoma progression, we used C57BL/6 mice expressing a tamoxifen-dependent cre recombinase expressed under the control of a fibroblast-specific promoter/enhancer (COL1A2) to delete CCN2 postnatally in fibroblasts. Mice deleted or not for CCN2 in fibroblasts were injected subcutaneously with B16-F10 melanoma cells. Loss of CCN2 in CAFs resulted in reduced CAF activation, as detected by staining with anti-\u03b1-smooth muscle actin antibodies, and reduced tumor-induced neovascularization, as detected by micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and staining with anti-CD31 antibodies. CCN2-deficient B16(F10) cells were defective in a tubule formation/vasculogenic mimicry assay in vitro. Mice deleted for CCN2 in CAFs also showed impaired vasculogenic mimicry of subcutaneously-injected B16-F10 cells in vivo. Our results provide new insights into the cross-talk among different cell types in the tumor microenvironment and suggest CAFs play a heretofore unappreciated role by being essential for tumor neovascularization via the production of CCN2. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that activated CAFs are essential for melanoma metastasis and that, due to its role in this process, CCN2 is a therapeutic target for melanoma.",

The pathogenetic chains from ITGA3 mutation to tissue abnormalities are still unclear. Although integrin \u03b13 was reported to regulate multiple extracellular proteins, the composition of the extracellular compartment of integrin \u03b13-negative keratinocytes has not been resolved so far. In a comprehensive approach, quantitative proteomics of deposited extracellular matrix, conditioned cultured media as well as of the intracellular compartment of keratinocytes isolated from an ILNEB patient and from normal skin were performed. By mass spectrometry-based proteomics, 167 proteins corresponding to the GO terms \u201cextracellular\u201d and \u201ccell adhesion\u201d, or included in the \u201chuman matrisome\u201d were identified in the deposited extracellular matrix, and 217 in the conditioned media of normal human keratinocytes.

We investigated the potential pro-fibrotic role of exosomes released by muscle-derived fibroblasts of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients, and of miRNAs carried by exosomes. By fibrosis focused array analysis we found that exosomes from DMD fibroblasts, had significantly higher levels of miR-199a-5p, a miRNA up-regulated in fibrotic conditions, compared to control exosomes, while levels in myoblast-derived exosomes were not increased. In control fibroblasts, exposure to DMD fibroblast-derived exosomes induced a myofibroblastic phenotype with increase in \u03b1-smooth actin, collagen and fibronectin transcript and protein expression, soluble collagen production and deposition, cell proliferation, and activation of Akt and ERK signaling, while exposure to control exosomes did not. Transfecting control fibroblasts or loading control exosomes with miR-199a-5p mimic or inhibitor induced opposing effects on fibrosis-related mRNAs and proteins, on collagen production and Akt and ERK pathways. Finally, injection of DMD fibroblast-derived exosomes into mouse tibialis anterior muscle after cardiotoxin-induced necrosis, produced greater fibrosis than control exosomes.Our findings indicate that exosomes produced by local fibroblasts in the DMD muscle are able to induce phenotypic conversion of normal fibroblasts to myofibroblasts thereby increasing the fibrotic response. This conversion is related to transfer of high levels of miR-199a-5p and to reduction of its target caveolin-1; both, therefore, are potential therapeutic targets in muscle fibrosis.",

     "abstract": "Basement membrane is a highly conserved sheet-like extracellular matrix in animals, underlying simple and complex epithelia, and wrapping around tissues like muscles and nerves. Like the tissues they support, basement membranes become damaged by environmental insults. Although it is clear that basement membranes are repaired after damage, virtually nothing is known about this process. For example, it is not known how repaired basement membranes compare to undamaged ones, whether basement membrane components are necessary for epithelial wound closure, or whether there is a hierarchy of assembly that repairing basement membranes follow, similar to the hierarchy of assembly of embryonic basement membranes. In this report, we address these questions using the basement membrane of the Drosophila larval epidermis as a model system. By analyzing the four main basement membrane proteins \u2013 laminin, collagen IV, perlecan, and nidogen \u2013 we find that although basement membranes are repaired within a day after mechanical damage in vivo, thickened and disorganized matrix scars are evident with all four protein components. The new matrix proteins that repair damaged basement membranes are provided by distant adipose and muscle tissues rather than by the local epithelium, the same distant tissues that provide matrix proteins for growth of unwounded epithelial basement membranes. To identify a hierarchy of repair, we tested the dependency of each of the basement membrane proteins on the others for incorporation after damage. For proper incorporation after damage, nidogen requires laminin, and perlecan requires collagen IV, but surprisingly collagen IV does not to depend on laminin. Thus, the rules of basement membrane repair are subtly different than those of de novo assembly.",

Our results indicated that focal cerebral ischemia induces partial depletion of PNNs and that mild hypoperfusion not associated with ischemic injury can induce ultra-structural rearrangements in visually intact meshworks. In line with the activation of neural plasticity under mild stress stimuli, we provide evidence that topological conversion of PNNs can support post stroke neural rewiring.",

The protein first appeared coincident with the closed circulatory system, and was critical for the evolutionary success of the vertebrate lineage. Elastin is expressed by multiple cell types in the lung, including mesothelial cells in the pleura, smooth muscle cells in airways and blood vessels, endothelial cells, and interstitial fibroblasts. This highly crosslinked protein associates with fibrillin-containing microfibrils to form the elastic fiber, which is the physiological structure that functions in the extracellular matrix. Elastic fibers can be woven into many different shapes depending on the mechanical needs of the tissue. In large pulmonary vessels, for example, elastin forms continuous sheets, or lamellae, that separate smooth muscle layers. Outside of the vasculature, elastic fibers form an extensive fiber network that originates in the central bronchi and inserts into the distal airspaces and visceral pleura. The fibrous cables form a looping system that encircle the alveolar ducts and terminal air spaces and ensures that applied force is transmitted equally to all parts of the lung. Normal lung function depends on proper secretion and assembly of elastin, and either inhibition of elastin fiber assembly or degradation of existing elastin results in lung dysfunction and disease.",

Recent studies revealed that fibulin-3, 4, and 5, which are matricellular proteins collectively termed \u201cshort fibulins\u201d or \u201celastic fibulins\u201d, play crucial roles in the assembly of elastic fibers. Although these fibulins are closely related paralogs with very similar domain structures and sequences, they have independent molecular functions in elastogenesis, as evidenced by different phenotypes in their gene-knockout mice and in patients with mutations in these genes. More recently, emerging evidence suggests that fibulin-4 is also necessary for fibrillar collagen assembly. In this review, I focus on the roles of short fibulins and their associating molecules in the assembly of elastic fibers and collagen fibers. Human diseases caused by mutations in the genes for these molecules are also reviewed. These matricellular proteins could be novel therapeutic targets for emphysema and lung fibrosis.",

Alterations in lung ECMs that expose cells to new cryptic fragments, generated in response to endogenous proteinases or exogenous toxins, are associated with the development of several common respiratory diseases. How lung ECMs provide or relay vital signals to epithelial and mesenchymal cells has shed new light on development and progression of several common chronic respiratory diseases. This review will consider how ECMs regulate lung homeostasis and their reorganization under pathological conditions that can modulate the inflammatory diseases asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Better understanding of changes in the distribution of lung ECM could provide novel therapeutic approaches to treat chronic lung diseases.",

ECM-based therapeutics and bioengineering approaches represent promising novel strategies for regeneration/repair of the lung and treatment of chronic lung diseases. In this review, we assess the current state of lung ECM biology, including fundamental advances in ECM composition, dynamics, topography, and biomechanics; the role of the ECM in normal and aberrant lung development, adult lung diseases and autoimmunity; and ECM in the regulation of the stem cell niche. We identify opportunities to advance the field of lung ECM biology and provide a set recommendations for research priorities to advance knowledge that would inform novel approaches to the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic lung diseases.",

Lung cancer progression does not only depend on the presence of driver mutations within the cancer cells, but also on its interactions with the cellular and extracellular matrix environment. Genetic and epigenetic changes such as aberrant promoter methylation or altered expression of microRNAs cause the misexpression of collagens, laminins, proteoglycans, proteases and integrins in the tumor microenvironment. Associated signaling processes modulate the conversion of fibroblasts to contractile cancer-associated fibroblasts, tumor angiogenesis, escape from the immune system, and create a permissive niche for cancer stem cells. Protease-mediated digestion and posttranslational crosslinking of large matrix glycoproteins promote cancer cell motility by facilitating basement membrane penetration and by altering the stiffness of interstitial matrices. New therapeutic approaches utilizing specific matrix proteins as targets and tools for drug delivery have shown promising results in preclinical models of lung cancer.",

Recognition of infection and injury by receptors on lung innate immune cells is crucial for generation of antigen-specific responses by adaptive immune cells. The extracellular matrix of the lung, comprising the interstitium and basement membrane, plays a key role in the regulation of these immune systems. The matrix consists of several hundred assembled proteins that interact to form a bioactive scaffold. This template, modified by enzymes, acts to facilitate cell function and differentiation and changes dynamically with age and lung disease. Herein, we explore relationships between innate and adaptive immunity and the lung extracellular matrix. We discuss the interactions between extracellular matrix proteins, including glycosaminoglycans, with prominent effects on innate immune signaling effectors such as toll-like receptors. We describe the relationship of extracellular matrix proteins with adaptive immunity and leukocyte migration to sites of injury within the lung. Further study of these interactions will lead to greater knowledge of the role of matrix biology in lung immunity. The development of novel therapies for acute and chronic lung disease is dependent on a comprehensive understanding of these complex matrix-immunity interactions.",

As such, it comes as no surprise that the mechanism of just about every known disease can be traced back to some part of the matrix, typically in the form of an abnormal amount or activity level of a particular matrix component. These defects considerably affect downstream signaling axes leading to overt cellular dysfunction, organ failure, and death. From skin to bone, from vessels to brain, from eyes to all the internal organs, the matrix plays an incredible role as both a cause and potential means to reverse diseases. Human malaises including connective tissue disorders, muscular dystrophy, fibrosis, and cancer are all extracellular matrix-driven diseases.

     "abstract": "Heparan sulfate (HS) is an essential component of cell surface and matrix proteoglycans (HS-PGs) that include syndecans and perlecan. Because of their unique structural features, the HS chains are able to specifically interact with signaling proteins \u2013including bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)- via their HS-binding domain, regulating protein availability, distribution and action on target cells. Hereditary Multiple Exostoses (HME) is a rare pediatric disorder linked to germline heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in EXT1 or EXT2 that encode Golgi-resident glycosyltransferases responsible for HS synthesis, resulting in a systemic HS deficiency. HME is characterized by cartilaginous/bony tumors -called osteochondromas or exostoses- that form within perichondrium in long bones, ribs and other elements. This review examines most recent studies in HME, framing them in the context of classic studies. New findings show that the spectrum of EXT mutations is larger than previously realized and the clinical complications of HME extend beyond the skeleton. Osteochondroma development requires a somatic \u201csecond hit\u201d that would complement the germline EXT mutation to further decrease HS production and/levels at perichondrial sites of osteochondroma induction. Cellular studies have shown that the steep decreases in local HS levels: derange the normal homeostatic signaling pathways keeping perichondrium mesenchymal; cause excessive BMP signaling; and provoke ectopic chondrogenesis and osteochondroma formation. Data from HME mouse models have revealed that systemic treatment with a BMP signaling antagonist markedly reduces osteochondroma formation. In sum, recent studies have provided major new insights into the molecular and cellular pathogenesis of HME and the roles played by HS deficiency. These new insights have led to the first ever proof-of-principle demonstration that osteochondroma formation is a druggable process, paving the way toward the creation of a clinically-relevant treatment.",

     "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a painful joint disease characterized by progressive degeneration of the articular cartilage as well as associated changes to the subchondral bone, synovium, and surrounding joint tissues. While the effects of osteoarthritis on the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) have been well recognized, it is now becoming apparent that in many cases, the onset of the disease may be initially reflected in the matrix region immediately surrounding the chondrocytes, termed the pericellular matrix (PCM). Growing evidence suggests that the PCM \u2013 which along with the enclosed chondrocytes are termed the \u201cchondron\u201d \u2013 acts as a critical transducer or \u201cfilter\u201d of biochemical and biomechanical signals for the chondrocyte, serving to help regulate the homeostatic balance of chondrocyte metabolic activity in response to environmental signals. Indeed, it appears that alterations in PCM properties and cell-matrix interactions, secondary to genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, or biomechanical stimuli, could in fact serve as initiating or progressive factors for osteoarthritis. Here, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of the role of the PCM, with an emphasis on the reciprocity of changes that occur in this matrix region with disease, as well as how alterations in PCM properties could serve as a driver of ECM-based diseases such as osteoarthritis. Further study of the structure, function, and composition of the PCM in normal and diseased conditions may provide new insights into the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis, and presumably new therapeutic approaches for this disease.",

Fibrillin-1 assemblies (microfibrils and elastic fibers) represent a unique dual-function component of the architectural matrix. The first role is structural for they endow tissues with tensile strength and elasticity, transmit forces across them and demarcate functionally discrete areas within them. The second role is instructive in that these macroaggregates modulate a large variety of sub-cellular processes by interacting with mechanosensors, and integrin and syndecan receptors, and by modulating the bioavailability of local TGF\u03b2 signals. The multifunctional, tissue-specific nature of fibrillin-1 assemblies is reflected in the variety of clinical manifestations and disease mechanisms associated with the MFS phenotype. Characterization of mice with ubiquitous or cell type-restricted fibrillin-1 deficiency has unraveled some pathophysiological mechanisms associated with the MFS phenotype, such as altered mechanotransduction in the heart, dysregulated TGF\u03b2 signaling in the ascending aorta and perturbed stem cell fate in the bone marrow. In each case, potential druggable targets have also been identified.

While, COMP is known to play a role in collagen secretion and fibrillogenesis, chondrocyte proliferation and mechanical strength of tendons, the complete range of COMP functions remains to be defined. COMPopathies describe pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia (MED), two skeletal dysplasias caused by autosomal dominant COMP mutations. The majority of the mutations are in the calcium binding domains and compromise protein folding. COMPopathies are ER storage disorders in which the retention of COMP in the chondrocyte ER stimulates overwhelming cellular stress. The retention causes oxidative and inflammation processes leading to chondrocyte death and loss of long bone growth. In contrast, dysregulation of wild-type COMP expression is found in numerous diseases including: fibrosis, cardiomyopathy and breast and prostate cancers. The most exciting clinical application is the use of COMP as a biomarker for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and cartilage degeneration associated osteoarthritis and rheumatoid and, as a prognostic marker for joint injury. The ever expanding roles of COMP in single gene disorders and multifactorial diseases will lead to a better understanding of its functions in ECM and tissue homeostasis towards the goal of developing new therapeutic avenues.",

     "abstract": "Laminins are large heterotrimers composed of the \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 subunits with distinct tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression patterns. The laminin-\u03b12 subunit, encoded by the LAMA2 gene, is expressed in skeletal muscle, Schwann cells of the peripheral nerve and astrocytes and pericytes of the capillaries in the brain. Mutations in LAMA2 cause the most common type of congenital muscular dystrophies, called LAMA2 MD or MDC1A. The disorder manifests mostly as a muscular dystrophy but slowing of nerve conduction contributes to the disease. There are severe, non-ambulatory or milder, ambulatory variants, the latter resulting from reduced laminin-\u03b12 expression and/or deficient laminin-\u03b12 function. Lm-211 (\u03b12\u03b21\u03b31) is responsible for initiating basement membrane assembly. This is primarily accomplished by anchorage of Lm-211 to dystroglycan and \u03b17\u03b21 integrin receptors, polymerization, and binding to nidogen and other structural components. In LAMA2 MD, Lm-411 replaces Lm-211; however, Lm-411 lacks the ability to polymerize and bind to receptors. This results in a weakened basement membrane leading to the disease. The possibility of introducing structural repair proteins that correct the underlying abnormality is an attractive therapeutic goal. Recent studies in mouse models for LAMA2 MD reveal that introduction of laminin-binding linker proteins that restore lost functional activities can substantially ameliorate the disease. This review discusses the underlying mechanism of this repair and compares this approach to other developing therapies employing pharmacological treatments.",

Muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) plays several roles including but not limited to force transmission, regulation of growth factors and inflammatory responses, and influencing muscle stem cell (i.e. satellite cell) proliferation and differentiation. In most myopathies, muscle ECM undergoes remodeling and fibrotic changes that may be maladaptive for normal muscle function and recovery. In addition, mutations in skeletal muscle ECM and basement proteins can cause muscle disease. In this review, we summarize the clinical features of two of the most common congenital muscular dystrophies, COL6-related dystrophies and LAMA2-related dystrophies, which are caused by mutations in muscle ECM and basement membrane proteins. The study of clinical features of these diseases has helped to inform basic research and understanding of the biology of muscle ECM. In return, basic studies of muscle ECM have provided the conceptual framework to develop therapeutic interventions for these and other similar disorders of muscle.",

     "abstract": "Organ fibrosis is characterized by the accumulation of disorganized and stiff extracellular matrix (ECM) and represents the final stage of several life-threatening diseases. The progressive replacement of normal tissue by fibrotic ECM impedes organ functionality to the point of failure. Fibrosis affects millions of people worldwide with no effective cure for various reasons: (a) Due to the lack of clinical biomarkers and non-invasive detection methods fibrosis is often diagnosed too late, when organs are already destroyed beyond repair. (b) Fibrosis can be understood as dysregulated tissue repair that evolved robust programs to be able to respond to various injury scenarios. The redundant nature of these programs often evades linear therapeutic strategies. (c) Fibrosis perpetuates itself by establishing conditions that activate normal into fibrogenic cells which, in turn, create a pro-fibrotic environment. ECM takes center stage in the process of fibrosis as a defining feature and thus potential diagnostic biomarker. The ECM is also a main promoter of the disease process by providing lasting physicochemical pro-fibrotic cues to residing and recruiting cells. Effective anti-fibrotic therapies will need to take the lasting (mis-) instructive character of scar ECM into account. To restore organ functionality, it will be important to (re)turn fibrotic scar into functional ECM, for instance by dissolving fibrotic ECM and delivering cells with regenerative potential.",

ADAMTS proteases are zinc metalloendopeptidases, most of whose substrates are extracellular matrix (ECM) components, whereas ADAMTS-like proteins lack a metalloprotease domain, reside in the ECM and have regulatory roles vis-\u00e0-vis ECM assembly and/or ADAMTS activity. Evolutionary conservation and expansion of ADAMTS proteins in mammals is suggestive of crucial embryologic or physiological roles in humans. Indeed, Mendelian disorders or birth defects resulting from naturally occurring ADAMTS2, ADAMTS3, ADAMTS10, ADAMTS13, ADAMTS17, ADAMTS20, ADAMTSL2 and ADAMTSL4 mutations as well as numerous phenotypes identified in genetically engineered mice have revealed ADAMTS participation in major biological pathways. Important roles have been identified in a few acquired conditions. ADAMTS5 is unequivocally implicated in pathogenesis of osteoarthritis via degradation of aggrecan, a major structural proteoglycan in cartilage. ADAMTS7 is strongly associated with coronary artery disease and promotes atherosclerosis. Autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 lead to a platelet coagulopathy, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, which is similar to that resulting from ADAMTS13 mutations. ADAMTS proteins have numerous potential connections to other human disorders that were identified by genome-wide association studies. Here, we review inherited and acquired human disorders in which ADAMTS proteins participate, and discuss progress and prospects in therapeutics.",

Most mutations are found towards the N-terminus of the triple helical collagenous domain and compromise extracellular microfibril assembly. Outside the triple helix collagen VI is highly polymorphic and discriminating mutations from rare benign changes remains a major diagnostic challenge. Collagen VI deficiency alters extracellular matrix structure and biomechanical properties and leads to increased apoptosis and oxidative stress, decreased autophagy, and impaired muscle regeneration.

The latest classification recognizes 13 clinical subtypes, with mutations identified in 19 different genes. Besides defects in fibrillar collagens (collagen types I, III and V), their modifying enzymes (ADAMTS-2, lysylhydroxylase 1 (LH1)), and molecules involved in collagen folding (FKBP22), defects have recently been identified in other constituents of the extracellular matrix (e.g. Tenascin-X, collagen type XII), enzymes involved in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis (\u03b24GalT7 and \u03b23GalT6), dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4ST1), dermatan sulfate epimerase (DSE)), (putative) transcription factors (ZNF469, PRDM5), components of the complement pathway (C1r, C1s) and an intracellular Zinc transporter (ZIP13). Easy bruising is, to a variable degree, present in all subtypes of EDS. A variable bleeding tendency, manifesting e.g. as gum bleeding, menometrorraghia, postnatal or peri-operative hemorrhage is observed in many EDS-patients of varying EDS subtypes. Life-threatening arterial aneurysms, dissections and ruptures of medium-sized and large arteries are a hallmark of the vascular subtype of EDS, caused by a molecular defect in collagen type III, an important constituent of blood vessel walls and hollow organs. They may however also occur in other EDS subtypes, especially in classical EDS, caused by defects in type V collagen or, rarely, type I collagen, and in kyphoscoliotic EDS, caused by defects in LH1 or FKBP22. These manifestations of vascular fragility and bleeding are usually attributed to fragility of the blood vessel walls and the perivascular connective tissues, but the molecular pathomechanisms underlying these complications are poorly studied.This review summarizes current knowledge on manifestations of vascular fragility in the different EDS subtypes.",

     "abstract": "The content of proteoglycans (PGs) is low in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of vascular tissue, but increases dramatically in all phases of vascular disease. Early studies demonstrated that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) including chondroitin sulfate (CS), dermatan sulfate (DS), keratan sulfate (KS) and heparan sulfate (HS) accumulate in vascular lesions in both humans and in animal models in areas of the vasculature that are susceptible to disease initiation (such as at branch points) and are frequently coincident with lipid deposits. Later studies showed the GAGs were covalently attached to specific types of core proteins that accumulate in vascular lesions. These molecules include versican (CSPG), biglycan and decorin (DS/CSPGs), lumican and fibromodulin (KSPGs) and perlecan (HSPG), although other types of PGs are present, but in lesser quantities. While the overall molecular design of these macromolecules is similar, there is tremendous structural diversity among the different PG families creating multiple forms that have selective roles in critical events that form the basis of vascular disease. PGs interact with a variety of different molecules involved in disease pathogenesis. For example, PGs bind and trap serum components that accumulate in vascular lesions such as lipoproteins, amyloid, calcium, and clotting factors. PGs interact with other ECM components and regulate, in part, ECM assembly and turnover. PGs interact with cells within the lesion and alter the phenotypes of both resident cells and cells that invade the lesion from the circulation. A number of therapeutic strategies have been developed to target specific PGs involved in key pathways that promote vascular disease. This review will provide a historical perspective of this field of research and then highlight some of the evidence that defines the involvement of PGs and their roles in the pathogenesis of vascular disease.",

     "abstract": "Dysfunctional endothelial cells are an essential contributor to the progression of diverse chronic cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic diseases. It manifests in impairment of nitric oxide-dependent vasorelaxation, vascular permeability, and leukocytes deterrent. While endothelial glycocalyx is known to regulate these functions, glycocalyx has been shown to be impaired in pathologic settings leading to endothelial dysfunction. Are these findings coincidental or are they indicative of a potential cooperation of the glycocalyx and the endothelium in inducing a dysfunctional phenotype? The main thrust of this overview is to advance a hypothesis on the existence of vicious circle relations between impaired endothelial glycocalyx and endothelial cell dysfunction. We briefly introduce physiology and pathology of blood flow-induced components of mechanotransduction in endothelial cells, as this function is dependent on glycocalyx and is critically involved in the development of endothelial dysfunction. Next, we present a series of experimental findings and arguments favoring the view on the impairment of mechanotransduction in dysfunctional endothelia. We advance the concept of feedback reinforcement between perturbed endothelial glycocalyx and progression of endothelial dysfunction and sketch therapeutic approaches to restore them. Among those we introduce our recently designed liposomal nanocarriers of preassembled glycocalyx and present evidence of their ability to expeditiously restore endothelial mechanotransduction.",

     "abstract": "The extracellular matrix of the central nervous system is an interconnected network of proteins and sugars. It is crucial for homeostasis, but its remodeling in neurological diseases impacts both injury and repair. Here we introduce an extracellular matrix family member that participates in immune-matrix interactions, the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans integrate signals from the microenvironment to activate immune cells, and they boost inflammatory responses by binding immunological receptors including toll-like receptors, selectins, CD44, and \u03b21 integrin. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans also bind signaling molecules for immune cells such as cytokines and chemokines, and they activate matrix-degrading enzymes. Chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans accumulate in the damaged CNS, including during traumatic brain/spinal cord injury and multiple sclerosis, and they help drive pathogenesis. This Review aims to give new insights into the remodeling of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans during inflammation, and how these matrix glycoproteins are able to drive neuroinflammation.",

Here, we developed a method for culturing mouse and human islets in vitro on \u03b15-laminins, which are natural components of islet basement membranes. Adhering islets spread to form layers of 1\u20133 cells in thickness and remained normoxic and functional for at least 7\u202fdays in culture. In contrast, spherical islets kept in suspension developed hypoxia and central necrosis within 16\u202fh.

     "abstract": "Therapeutic approaches aimed at curing prostate cancer are only partially successful given the occurrence of highly metastatic resistant phenotypes that frequently develop in response to therapies. Recently, we have described \u03b1v\u03b26, a surface receptor of the integrin family as a novel therapeutic target for prostate cancer; this epithelial-specific molecule is an ideal target since, unlike other integrins, it is found in different types of cancer but not in normal tissues.We describe a novel \u03b1v\u03b26-mediated signaling pathway that has profound effects on the microenvironment. We show that \u03b1v\u03b26 is transferred from cancer cells to monocytes, including \u03b26-null monocytes, by exosomes and that monocytes from prostate cancer patients, but not from healthy volunteers, express \u03b1v\u03b26. Cancer cell exosomes, purified via density gradients, promote M2 polarization, whereas \u03b1v\u03b26 down-regulation in exosomes inhibits M2 polarization in recipient monocytes. Also, as evaluated by our proteomic analysis, \u03b1v\u03b26 down-regulation causes a significant increase in donor cancer cells, and their exosomes, of two molecules that have a tumor suppressive role, STAT1 and MX1/2. Finally, using the Ptenpc\u2212/\u2212 prostate cancer mouse model, which carries a prostate epithelial-specific Pten deletion, we demonstrate that \u03b1v\u03b26 inhibition in vivo causes up-regulation of STAT1 in cancer cells.Our results provide evidence of a novel mechanism that regulates M2 polarization and prostate cancer progression through transfer of \u03b1v\u03b26 from cancer cells to monocytes through exosomes.",

Thus, effective treatments are urgently needed. LAMA2-CMD is either a severe, early-onset condition with complete laminin \u03b12 chain-deficiency or a milder, late-onset form with partial laminin \u03b12 chain-deficiency. Mouse models dy3K/dy3K and dy2J/dy2J, respectively, recapitulate these two forms of LAMA2-CMD very well. We have previously demonstrated that laminin \u03b11 chain significantly reduces muscular dystrophy in laminin \u03b12 chain-deficient dy3K/dy3K mice. Among all the different pre-clinical approaches that have been evaluated in mice, laminin \u03b11 chain-mediated therapy has been shown to be one of the most effective lines of attack. However, it has remained unclear if laminin \u03b11 chain-mediated treatment is also applicable for partial laminin \u03b12 chain-deficiency. Hence, we have generated dy2J/dy2J mice (that express a substantial amount of an N-terminal truncated laminin \u03b12 chain) overexpressing laminin \u03b11 chain in the neuromuscular system. The laminin \u03b11 chain transgene ameliorated the dystrophic phenotype, restored muscle strength and reduced peripheral neuropathy. Thus, these findings provide additional support for the development of laminin \u03b11 chain-based therapy for LAMA2-CMD.",

Using knockdown in cell culture and gene ablation in mice we have directly compared the roles of ATF6\u03b1 & \u03b2 in responding to the increased ER stress induced by mutant forms of type X collagen that cause the ER stress-associated metaphyseal chondrodysplasia type Schmid (MCDS). ATF6\u03b1 more efficiently deals with the disease-associated ER stress in the absence of ATF6\u03b2 and conversely, ATF6\u03b2 is less effective in the absence of ATF6\u03b1. Furthermore, disease severity in vivo is increased by ATF6\u03b1 ablation and decreased by ATF6\u03b2 ablation. In addition, novel functions for each paralogue are described including an ATF6\u03b2-specific role in controlling growth plate chondrocyte proliferation. The clear demonstration of the intimate relationship of the two ATF6 isoforms and how ATF6\u03b2 can moderate the activity of ATF6\u03b1 and vice versa is of great significance for understanding the UPR mechanism. The activities of both ATF6 isoforms and their separate roles need consideration when deciding how to target increased ER stress as a means of treating MCDS and other ER stress-associated diseases.",

     "abstract": "Type III collagen is a major fibrillar collagen consisting of three identical \u03b11(III)-chains that is particularly present in tissues exhibiting elastic properties, such as the skin and the arterial wall. Heterozygous mutations in the COL3A1 gene result in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS), a severe, life-threatening disorder, characterized by thin, translucent skin and propensity to arterial, intestinal and uterine rupture. Most human vEDS cases result from a missense mutation substituting a crucial glycine residue in the triple helical domain of the \u03b11(III)-chains. The mechanisms by which these mutant type III collagen molecules cause dermal and vascular fragility are not well understood. We generated a transgenic mouse line expressing mutant type III collagen, containing a typical helical glycine substitution (p.(Gly182Ser)). This Col3a1Tg-G182S mouse line displays a phenotype recapitulating characteristics of human vEDS patients with signs of dermal and vascular fragility. The Col3a1Tg-G182S mice develop severe transdermal skin wounds, resulting in early demise at 13\u201314\u00a0weeks of age. We found that this phenotype was associated with a reduced total collagen content and an abnormal collagen III:I ratio, leading to the production of severely malformed collagen fibrils in the extracellular matrix of dermal and arterial tissues. These results indicate that expression of the glycine substitution in the \u03b11(III)-chain disturbs formation of heterotypic type III:I collagen fibrils, and thereby demonstrate a key role for type III collagen in collagen fibrillogenesis in dermal and arterial tissues.",

Variants in the HTRA1-ARMS2 locus have been linked to increased AMD risk. In the present study we investigated the impact of elevated HtrA1 levels on the retina pigment epithelial (RPE) secretome using a polarized culture system. Upregulation of HtrA1 alters the abundance of key proteins involved in angiogenesis and extracellular matrix remodeling. Thrombospondin-1, an angiogenesis modulator, was identified as a substrate for HtrA1 using terminal amine isotope labeling of substrates in conjunction with HtrA1 specificity profiling. HtrA1 cleavage of thrombospondin-1 was further corroborated by in vitro cleavage assays and targeted proteomics together with small molecule inhibition of HtrA1. While thrombospondin-1 is anti-angiogenic, the proteolytically released N-terminal fragment promotes the formation of tube-like structure by endothelial cells. Taken together, our findings suggest a mechanism by which increased levels of HtrA1 may contribute to AMD pathogenesis.The proteomic data has been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier.

     "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration and associated low back and neck pain is a ubiquitous health condition that affects millions of people world-wide, and causes high incidence of disability and enormous medical/societal costs. However, lack of appropriate small animal models with spontaneous disease onset has impeded our ability to understand the pathogenetic mechanisms that characterize and drive the degenerative process. We report, for the first time, early onset spontaneous disc degeneration in SM/J mice known for their poor regenerative capacities compared to \u201csuper-healer\u201d LG/J mice. In SM/J mice, degenerative process was marked by decreased nucleus pulposus (NP) cellularity and changes in matrix composition at P7, 4, and 8\u202fweeks with increased severity by 17\u202fweeks. Distinctions between NP and annulus fibrosus (AF) or endplate cartilage were lost, and NP and AF of SM/J mice showed higher histological grades. There was increased NP cell death in SM/J mice with decreased phenotypic marker expression. Polarized microscopy and FTIR spectroscopy demonstrated replacement of glycosaminoglycan-rich NP matrix with collagenous fibrous tissue. The levels of ARGxx were increased in, indicating higher aggrecan turnover. Furthermore, an aberrant expression of collagen X and MMP13 was observed in the NP of SM/J mice, along with elevated expression of Col10a1, Ctgf, and Runx2, markers of chondrocyte hypertrophy. Likewise, expression of Enpp1 as well as Alpl was higher, suggesting NP cells of SM/J mice promote dystrophic mineralization. There was also a decrease in several pathways necessary for NP cell survival and function including Wnt and VEGF signaling. Importantly, SM/J discs were stiffer, had decreased height, and poor vertebral bone quality, suggesting compromised motion segment mechanical functionality. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that SM/J mouse strain recapitulates many salient features of human disc degeneration, and serves as a novel small animal model.",

     "abstract": "Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) causes back pain and sciatica, affecting quality of life and resulting in high economic/social burden. The etiology of IDD is not well understood. Along with aging and environmental factors, genetic factors also influence the onset, progression and severity of IDD. Genetic studies of risk factors for IDD using human cohorts are limited by small sample size and low statistical power. Animal models amenable to genetic and functional studies of IDD provide desirable alternatives. Despite differences in size and cellular content as compared to human intervertebral discs (IVDs), the mouse is a powerful model for genetics and assessment of cellular changes relevant to human biology. Here, we provide evidence for early onset disc degeneration in SM/J relative to LG/J mice with poor and good tissue healing capacity respectively. In the first few months of life, LG/J mice maintain a relatively constant pool of notochordal-like cells in the nucleus pulposus (NP) of the IVD. In contrast, chondrogenic events are observed in SM/J mice beginning as early as one-week-old, with progressive fibrotic changes. Further, the extracellular matrix changes in the NP are consistent with IVD degeneration. Leveraging on the genomic data of two parental and two recombinant inbred lines, we assessed the genetic contribution to the NP changes and identified processes linked to the regulation of ion transport systems. Significantly, \u201ctransport\u201d system is also in the top three gene ontology (GO) terms from a comparative proteomic analysis of the mouse NP. These findings support the potential of the SM/J, LG/J and their recombinant inbred lines for future genetic and biological analysis in mice and validation of candidate genes and biological relevance in human cohort studies.

     "abstract": "Since its first description, ADAMTS14 has been considered as an aminoprocollagen peptidase based on its high similarity with ADAMTS3 and ADAMTS2. As its importance for procollagen processing was never experimentally demonstrated in vivo, we generated Adamts14-deficient mice. They are healthy, fertile and display normal aminoprocollagen processing. They were further crossed with Adamts2-deficient mice to evaluate potential functional redundancies between these two highly related enzymes. Initial characterizations made on young Adamts2-Adamts14-deficient animals showed the same phenotype as that of Adamts2-deficient mice, with no further reduction of procollagen processing and no significant aggravation of the structural alterations of collagen fibrils. However, when evaluated at older age, Adamts2-Adamts14-deficient mice surprisingly displayed epidermal lesions, appearing in 2\u202fmonth-old males and later in some females, and then worsening rapidly. Immunohistological evaluations of skin sections around the lesions revealed thickening of the epidermis, hypercellularity in the dermis and extensive infiltration by immune cells. Additional investigations, performed on young mice before the formation of the initial lesions, revealed that the primary cause of the phenotype was not related to alterations of the epidermal barrier but was rather the result of an abnormal activation and differentiation of T lymphocytes towards a Th1 profile. However, the primary molecular defect probably does not reside in the immune system itself since irradiated Adamts2-Adamts14-deficient mice grafted with WT immune cells still developed lesions.While originally created to better characterize the common and specific functions of ADAMTS2 and ADAMTS14 in extracellular matrix and connective tissues homeostasis, the Adamts2-Adamts14-deficient mice revealed an unexpected but significant role of ADAMTS in the regulation of immune system, possibly through a cross-talk involving mesenchymal cells and the TGF\u03b2 pathways.",

A variety of different cells are activated into myofibroblasts to produce and remodel the scar matrix. Temporal and spatial coordination of myofibroblast activities with inflammatory macrophages is crucial for the controlled healing process. Miscommunication can result in either insufficient (chronic) or exacerbated (fibrotic) repair. In addition to soluble biochemical signals and intercellular contacts, cell-to-cell communication is mediated by biophysical and chemical signals transmitted through the extracellular matrix. Over the course of healing, the matrix takes over the role of a master coordinator; failure to do so produces poor healing outcomes that reduce organ function. Understanding the mechanical and chemical state of the matrix and its effects on cellular processes will be essential to address diseases that are characterized by dysfunctional matrix, such as fibrosis.",

     "abstract": "Organs and tissues in mammals can undergo self-repair following injury. However, chronic or severe tissue injury leads to the development of dense scar tissue or fibrosis at the expense of regeneration. The identification of novel therapeutic strategies aiming at reversing fibrosis is therefore a major clinical unmet need in regenerative medicine. Persistent activation of scar-forming myofibroblasts distinguishes non-resolving pathological fibrosis from self-limited physiological wound healing. Thus, therapeutic strategies selectively inducing myofibroblast apoptosis could prevent progression and potentially reverse established fibrosis in fibrotic diseases. In this Review, we discuss recent findings that have demonstrated that activated myofibroblasts, traditionally viewed as apoptosis-resistant cells, are actually \u201cprimed for death\u201d. In this state, mitochondria of activated myofibroblasts are loaded with proapoptotic BH3 proteins, which creates a cellular \u201caddiction\u201d to individual antiapoptotic proteins to block prodeath signaling and ensure survival. This creates a novel therapeutic opportunity to treat organ fibrosis by inducing myofibroblast apoptosis with the so-called BH3 mimetic drugs, which have recently shown potent antifibrotic activities in experimental models. Finally, we discuss the potential use of BH3 profiling as a functional tool to diagnose myofibroblast addiction to individual antiapoptotic proteins, which may serve to guide and assign the most effective BH3 mimetic drug for patients with fibrotic disease.",

During all individual stages of fibrosis ECM proteases, mainly matrix metalloproteinases, have diverse roles. The functional role of MMPs and their endogenous inhibitors are differentiated among their family members, and according to the different stages of fibrosis. MMPs levels are elevated in several inflammatory and non-inflammatory fibrotic tissues contributing to the development, progression or resolution of the disease, whereas in other tissues their expression levels can be diminished or be stable to the baseline. The biological roles of MMPs during fibrosis are not fully resolved, but they seem to differ according the specific member of the family, the affected tissue and the stage of the fibrotic response. Remarkably, some members of the family exhibit profibrotic actions while other function as antifibrotic molecules. Diverse animal models indicate that MMPs are contributing in processes related to immunity, tissue repair and ECM turnover, providing significant impact on mechanisms related to fibrosis. For that purpose, these proteases are considered as pharmacological targets and new biological drugs have been developed in order to treat fibrosis.",

Although it is known that glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) play an important role in tumor signaling, their contribution to the biomechanical properties of tumor ECM is unknown.In this study, ECM structures of human colon carcinoma and normal (control) colon tissues were histologically identified. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation, we show that the collagen-rich regions within the ECM of colon carcinoma tissues were significantly stiffer than the submucosal collagen-rich layer of control tissues. Screening of these regions with Raman microspectroscopy revealed significantly different molecular fingerprints for collagen fibers in colon carcinoma tissues compared to control tissues. We further showed an increased alignment of collagen fibers and elevated levels of GAG immuno-reactivity within the collagen network of colon carcinoma tissues. GAGs such as heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate were detected in significantly elevated levels in collagen fibers of carcinoma tissues. Moreover, immunodetection of the collagen-associated proteoglycan decorin was significantly decreased in carcinomas tissues of individual patients when compared with the corresponding control tissues. Overall a strong patient-to-patient variability was evident in the ECM composition, structure and biomechanics of individual colon carcinoma tissues. Although, biomechanical characteristics of tumor ECM were not directly impacted by GAG content, GAGs might play an important role during the mechanical and structural remodeling of pathological tumor ECM. To manipulate GAG expression and deposition in tumor microenvironments could represent a novel potential therapeutic strategy.",

However, emerging data focuses on how the response of the proximal tubule, a specialized epithelial segment vulnerable to injury, plays a central role in TIF progression. Several proximal tubular responses such as de-differentiation, cell cycle changes, autophagy, and metabolic changes may be adaptive initially, but can lead to maladaptive responses that promote TIF both through autocrine and paracrine effects. This review discusses the current paradigm of TIF progression and the increasingly important role of the proximal tubule in promoting TIF both in tubulointerstitial and glomerular injuries.

     "abstract": "Simplification and retraction of podocyte protrusions, generally termed as foot process effacement, is a uniform pathological pattern observed in the majority of glomerular disease, including focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. However, it is still incompletely understood how the interaction of cortical actin structures, actomyosin contractility and focal adhesions, is being orchestrated to control foot process morphology in health and disease. By uncovering the functional role of fermitin family member 2 (FERMT2 or kindlin-2) in podocytes, we provide now evidence, how cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions modulate membrane tension and actomyosin contractility. A genetic modeling approach was applied by deleting FERMT2 in a set of in vivo systems as well as in CRISPR/Cas9 modified human podocytes. Loss of FERMT2 results in altered cortical actin composition, cell cortex destabilization associated with plasma membrane blebbing and a remodeling of focal adhesions. We further show that FERMT2 knockout podocytes have high levels of RhoA activation and concomitantly increased actomyosin contractility. Inhibition of actomyosin tension reverses the membrane blebbing phenotype. Thus, our findings establish a direct link between cell-matrix adhesions, cortical actin structures and plasma membrane tension allowing to better explain cell morphological changes in foot process effacement.",

     "abstract": "Th1 and Th17 cells, T helper (Th) subtypes, are key inducers of renal fibrosis. The molecular mechanisms of their recruitment into the kidney, however, are not well understood. Here, we show that biglycan, a proteoglycan of the extracellular matrix, acting in its soluble form as a danger signal, stimulates autonomously the production of Th1 and Th17 chemoattractants CXCL10 and CCL20 in macrophages. In the presence of IFN\u03b3, biglycan synergistically stimulates CXCL9. In macrophages deficient for TLR2, TLR4, and their adaptor molecules MyD88 or TRIF, we identified highly selective mechanisms of biglycan-dependent Th1/17 chemoattraction. Thus, the expression of CXCL9 and CXCL10, common chemoattractants for CXCR3-positive Th1 and Th17 cells, is triggered in a biglycan-TLR4/TRIF-dependent manner. By contrast, biglycan induces CCL20 chemokine production, responsible for CCR6-positive Th17 cell recruitment, in a TLR2/4/MyD88-dependent manner. Importantly, at the onset of diabetes mellitus and lupus nephritis we provide evidence for biglycan-dependent recruitment of Th1 and Th17 cells, IFN\u03b3 and IL-17 production, and development of albuminuria in mice lacking or overexpressing soluble biglycan. Furthermore, by genetic ablation of Cxcl10 we showed in vivo involvement of this chemokine in biglycan-dependent recruitment of Th1 and Th17 cells into the kidney. Finally, a positive correlation of biglycan and CXCL10/CXCL9 levels was detected in plasma from patients with diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis. Taken together, we identified biglycan as a novel trigger of Th1 and Th17 cell recruitment into the kidney and we postulate that interfering with biglycan/TLR/TRIF/MyD88-signaling might provide novel therapeutic avenues for renal fibrosis.",

ER stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) have been linked to lung fibrosis through regulation of AEC apoptosis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, myofibroblast differentiation, and M2 macrophage polarization. Although progress has been made in understanding the causes and consequences of ER stress in IPF and a number of chronic fibrotic disorders, further studies are needed to identify key factors that induce ER stress in important cell types and define critical down-stream processes and effector molecules that mediate ER stress-related phenotypes.

Therefore, proteases and anti-proteases aroused great biomedical interest over the past years, owing to the identification of their potential roles in lung fibrosis.

Non-invasive biomarkers, in particular serum biomarkers, for the (early) diagnosis, differential diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapeutic response are urgently needed. Numerous molecules involved in alveolar epithelial cell injury, fibroproliferation and matrix remodeling as well as immune regulation have been proposed as potential biomarkers. Furthermore, genetic variants of TOLLIP, MUC5B, and other genes are associated with a differential response to treatment and with the development and/or the prognosis of IPF. Additionally, the bacterial signature in IPF lungs, as shown from microbiome analyses, as well as mitochondrial DNA seem to have promising roles as biomarkers.

While initially much of the mechanistic understanding was derived from hypotheses generated from animal models of disease, in recent decades new insights derived from humans with IPF have taken precedence. This is mainly because of the establishment of large collections of IPF lung tissues and patient cohorts, and the emergence of high throughput profiling technologies collectively termed \u2018omics\u2019 technologies based on their shared suffix. In this review we describe impacts of \u2018omics\u2019 analyses of human IPF samples on our understanding of the disease. In particular, we discuss the results of genomics and transcriptomics studies, as well as proteomics, epigenomics and metabolomics. We then describe how these findings can be integrated in a modified paradigm of human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, that introduces the \u2018hallmarks of aging\u2019 as a central theme in the IPF lung. This allows resolution of all the disparate cellular and molecular features in IPF, from the central role of epithelial cells, through the dramatic phenotypic alterations observed in fibroblasts and the numerous aberrations that inflammatory cells exhibit.

     "abstract": "Liver fibrosis and in particular cirrhosis are the major causes of morbidity and mortality of patients with chronic liver disease. Their prevention or reversal have become major endpoints in clinical trials with novel liver specific drugs. Remarkable progress has been made with therapies that efficiently address the cause of the underlying liver disease, as in chronic hepatitis B and C. Highly effective antiviral therapy can prevent progression or even induce reversal in the majority of patients, but such treatment remains elusive for the majority of liver patients with advanced alcoholic or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, genetic or autoimmune liver diseases. Moreover, drugs that would speed up fibrosis reversal are needed for patients with cirrhosis, since even with effective causal therapy reversal is slow or the disease may further progress. Therefore, highly efficient and specific antifibrotic agents are needed that can address advanced fibrosis, i.e., the detrimental downstream result of all chronic liver diseases. This review discusses targeted antifibrotic therapies that address molecules and mechanisms that are central to fibrogenesis or fibrolysis, including strategies that allow targeting of activated hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts and other fibrogenic effector cells. Focus is on collagen synthesis, integrins and cells and mechanisms specific including specific downregulation of TGFbeta signaling, major extracellular matrix (ECM) components, ECM-crosslinking, and ECM-receptors such as integrins and discoidin domain receptors, ECM-crosslinking and methods for targeted delivery of small interfering RNA, antisense oligonucleotides and small molecules to increase potency and reduce side effects. With an increased understanding of the biology of the ECM and liver fibrosis and an improved preclinical validation, the translation of these approaches to the clinic is currently ongoing.

     "abstract": "Increased expression of syndecan-1 is a characteristic feature of human liver cirrhosis. However, no data are available on the significance of this alteration. To address this question we designed a transgenic mouse strain that driven by albumin promoter, expresses human syndecan-1 in the hepatocytes. Liver cirrhosis was induced by thioacetamide in wild type and hSDC1+/+ mice of the identical strain. The process of fibrogenesis, changes in signal transduction and proteoglycan expression were followed. In an in vitro experiment, the effect of syndecan-1 overexpression on the action of TGF\u03b21 was determined. Human syndecan-1 and TGF\u03b21 levels were measured by ELISA in the circulation. Without challenge, no morphological differences were observed between wild type and transgenic mice livers, although significant upregulation of phospho-Akt and FAK was observed in the latter. Fibrogenesis in the transgenic livers, characterized by picrosirius staining, collagen type I, and SMA levels, lagged behind that of control in the first and second months. Changes in signal transduction involved in the process of fibrogenesis, as SMAD, MAPK, Akt and GSK, pointed to the decreased effect of TGF\u03b21, and this was corroborated by the decreased mRNA expression of TIEG and the growth factor itself. In vitro experiments exposing the LX2 hepatic stellate cell line to conditioned media of wild type and syndecan-1 transfected Hep3B cell lines proved that medium with high syndecan-1 content inhibits TGF\u03b21-induced upregulation of SMA, TIEG, collagen type I and thrombospondin-1 expression. Detection of liver proteoglycans and heparan sulfate level revealed that their amounts are much higher in control transgenic liver, than that in the wild type. However, it decreases dramatically as a result of shedding after hepatic injury. Shedding is likely promoted by the upregulation of MMP14. As syndecan-1 can bind thrombospondin-1, and as our result demonstrated that the same is true for TGF\u03b21, shed syndecan-1 can remove the growth factor and its activator together into the systemic circulation.Taking together, our results indicate that the effect of syndecan-1 is accomplished on two levels: a, the shedded syndecan can bind, inhibit and remove TGF\u03b21; b, interferes with the activation of TGF\u03b21 by downregulation and binding thrombospondin-1, the activator of the growth factor. However, by the end of the fourth month the protective effect was lost, which is explained by the considerable decrease of syndecan-1 and the almost complete loss of heparan sulfate from the surface of hepatocytes.",

The clinical symptoms can vary considerably with a broad range from isolated small areas to the involvement of the entire integument. Fibrosis is triggered by a multitude of different stimuli leading to activation of the immune and vascular system that then initiate fibroblast activation and formation of matrix depositing and remodeling myofibroblasts. Ultimately, myofibroblasts deposit excessive amounts of extracellular matrix with a pathological architecture and alterations in growth factor binding and biomechanical properties, which culminates in skin hardening and loss of mobility. Treatment depends certainly on the specific type and cause of the disease, for the autoimmune driven localized and systemic scleroderma therapeutic options are still limited, but recent research has pointed out diverse molecular targets and mechanisms that can be exploited for the development of novel antifibrotic therapy.",

The goal of the current study was to uncover novel extracellular matrix (ECM) components that control the wound healing process. Full thickness skin defects were created in mice and used to show CCN4 up-regulation during wound-healing as early as 1\u202fday after surgery, suggesting a role in inflammation and subsequent dermal migration and proliferation. To determine how CCN4 could regulate wound healing we used Ccn4-KO mice and showed they had delayed wound closure accompanied by reduced expression of Col1a1 and Fn mRNA. Boyden chamber assays using Ccn4-deficient dermal fibroblasts showed they have reduced migration and proliferation compared to WT counterparts. To confirm CCN4 has a role in proliferation and migration of dermal cells, siRNA knockdown and transduction of CCN4 adenoviral transduction were used and resulted in reduced or enhanced migration of human adult dermal fibroblast (hADF) cells respectively. The induced migration of the dermal fibroblasts by CCN4 appears to work via \u03b15\u03b21 integrin receptors that further stimulates down-stream ERK/JNK signaling. The regulation of CCN4 by TNF-\u03b1 prompted us look further at their potential relationship. Treatment of hADFs with CCN4 and TNF-\u03b1 alone or together showed CCN4 counteracted the inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 on COL1A1 and FN mRNA expression and the stimulation of TNF-\u03b1 on MMP-1 and MMP3 mRNA expression. CCN4 appeared to counterbalance the effects of TNF-\u03b1 by inhibiting downstream NF-\u03baB/p-65 signaling. Taken together we show CCN4 stimulates dermal fibroblast cell migration, proliferation and inhibits TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, all of which could regulate wound healing.",

     "abstract": "Traumatic injury of the central nervous system is one of the leading causes of death and disability in young adults. Failure of regeneration is caused by autonomous neuronal obstacles and by formation of the glial scar, which is essential to seal the injury but also constitutes a barrier for regrowing axons. The scar center is highly inflammatory and populated by NG2+ glia, whereas astrocytes form the sealing border and trap regrowing axons, suggesting that the non-permissive environment of activated astrocytes and extracellular matrix components is one of the reasons for the regenerative failure. Particularly, secreted chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycans, CSPGs, of the lectican family hinder axonal regrowth. In contrast, the transmembrane CSPG, NG2/CSPG4, appears to be functionally closer related to axon growth permissive heparan sulfate proteoglycans, HSPGs, and synaptic adhesion molecules, which all regulate synaptic signaling and plasticity upon alpha-secretase mediated shedding. Consequently, knockout of NG2/CSPG4 aggravates tissue loss, inflammation and neurologic deficits after brain injury, a phenotype partly mimicked by deletion of HSPG-binding proteins such as the HSPG2/perlecan-interacting protein, progranulin that is also a functional ligand of Notch and Eph2a. Indeed, structural features or progranulin's targets and NG2 may point to direct reciprocal regulations that may act in concert to overcome injury-evoked inflammation and neuronal dystrophy. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology of the glial scar after brain injury, with a specific focus on NG2/CSPG4, its functions before and after shedding and putative reciprocal influences with the glycoprotein progranulin.",

     "abstract": "Fibrosis is defined as the thickening and scarring of connective tissue, usually as a consequence of tissue damage. The central nervous system (CNS) is special in the sense that fibrogenic cells are restricted to vascular and meningeal areas. Inflammation and the disruption of the blood-brain barrier can lead to the infiltration of fibroblasts and trigger fibrotic response. While the initial function of the fibrotic tissue is to restore the blood-brain barrier and to limit the site of injury, it also demolishes the structure of extracellular matrix and impedes the healing process by producing inhibitory molecules and forming a physical and biochemical barrier that prevents axon regeneration. As a major constituent in the extracellular matrix, proteoglycans participate in the neuro-inflammation, modulating the fibrotic process. In this review, we will discuss the pathophysiology of fibrosis during acute injuries of the CNS, as well as during chronic neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and age-related neurodegeneration with focus on the functional roles of proteoglycans.",

     "abstract": "The production of force and power are inherent properties of skeletal muscle, and regulated by contractile proteins within muscle fibers. However, skeletal muscle integrity and function also require strong connections between muscle fibers and their extracellular matrix (ECM). A well-organized and pliant ECM is integral to muscle function and the ability for many different cell populations to efficiently migrate through ECM is critical during growth and regeneration. For many neuromuscular diseases, genetic mutations cause disruption of these cytoskeletal-ECM connections, resulting in muscle fragility and chronic injury. Ultimately, these changes shift the balance from myogenic pathways toward fibrogenic pathways, culminating in the loss of muscle fibers and their replacement with fatty-fibrotic matrix. Hence a common pathological hallmark of muscular dystrophy is prominent fibrosis. This review will cover the salient features of muscular dystrophy pathogenesis, highlight the signals and cells that are important for myogenic and fibrogenic actions, and discuss how fibrosis alters the ECM of skeletal muscle, and the consequences of fibrosis in developing therapies.",

     "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays key roles in normal and diseased skeletal and cardiac muscle. In healthy muscle the ECM is essential for transmitting contractile force, maintaining myofiber integrity and orchestrating cellular signaling. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is caused by loss of dystrophin, a cytosolic protein that anchors a transmembrane complex and serves as a vital link between the actin cytoskeleton and the basal lamina. Loss of dystrophin leads to membrane fragility and impaired signaling, resulting in myofiber death and cycles of inflammation and regeneration. Fibrosis is also a cardinal feature of DMD. In this review, we will focus on two cases where understanding the normal function and regulation of ECM in muscle has led to the discovery of candidate therapeutics for DMD. Biglycan is a small leucine rich repeat ECM protein present as two glycoforms in muscle that have dramatically different functions. One widely expressed form is biglycan proteoglycan (PG) that bears two chondroitin sulfate GAG chains (typically chondroitin sulfate) and two N-linked carbohydrates. The second glycoform, referred to as \u2018NG\u2019 (non-glycanated) biglycan, lacks the GAG side chains. NG, but not PG biglycan recruits utrophin, an autosomal paralog of dystrophin, and an NOS-containing signaling complex to the muscle cell membrane. Recombinant NG biglycan can be systemically delivered to dystrophic mice where it upregulates utrophin at the membrane and improves muscle health and function. An optimized version of NG biglycan, \u2018TVN-102\u2019, is under development as a candidate therapeutic for DMD. A second matrix-embedded protein being evaluated for therapeutic potential is latent TGF\u03b2 binding protein 4 (LTBP4). Identified in a genomic screen for modifiers of muscular dystrophy, LTBP4 binds both TGF\u03b2 and myostatin. Genetic studies identified the hinge region of LTBP4 as linked to TGF\u03b2 release and contributing to the \u201chyper-TGF\u03b2\u201d signaling state that promotes fibrosis in muscular dystrophy. This hinge region can be stabilized by antibodies directed towards this domain. Stabilizing the hinge region of LTBP4 is expected to reduce latent TGF\u03b2 release and thus reduce fibrosis.",

     "abstract": "Endplate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) deficiency is a form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) caused by mutations in COLQ, which encodes collagen Q (ColQ). ColQ is an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein that anchors AChE to the synaptic basal lamina. Biglycan, encoded by BGN, is another ECM protein that binds to the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) on skeletal muscle, which links the actin cytoskeleton and ECM proteins to stabilize the sarcolemma during repeated muscle contractions. Upregulation of biglycan stabilizes the DPAC.Gene therapy can potentially ameliorate any disease that can be recapitulated in cultured cells. However, the difficulty of tissue-specific and developmental stage-specific regulated expression of transgenes, as well as the difficulty of introducing a transgene into all cells in a specific tissue, prevents us from successfully applying gene therapy to many human diseases. In contrast to intracellular proteins, an ECM protein is anchored to the target tissue via its specific binding affinity for protein(s) expressed on the cell surface within the target tissue. Exploiting this unique feature of ECM proteins, we developed protein-anchoring therapy in which a transgene product expressed even in remote tissues can be delivered and anchored to a target tissue using specific binding signals.We demonstrate the application of protein-anchoring therapy to two disease models. First, intravenous administration of adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 8-COLQ to Colq-deficient mice, resulting in specific anchoring of ectopically expressed ColQ-AChE at the NMJ, markedly improved motor functions, synaptic transmission, and the ultrastructure of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). In the second example, Mdx mice, a model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, were intravenously injected with AAV8-BGN. The treatment ameliorated motor deficits, mitigated muscle histopathologies, decreased plasma creatine kinase activities, and upregulated expression of utrophin and DAPC component proteins. We propose that protein-anchoring therapy could be applied to hereditary/acquired defects in ECM and secreted proteins, as well as therapeutic overexpression of such factors.",

Mice with germline MAGP1 deficiency (Mfap2\u2212/\u2212) develop increased adiposity, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, bone marrow adipose tissue expansion, reduced cancellous bone mass, cortical bone thinning and bone fragility. The goal of this study was to assess whether the Mfap2\u2212/\u2212 bone phenotypes were due to loss of MAGP1 locally or secondary to a change in whole body physiology (metabolic dysfunction). To do this, mice with conditional deletion of MAGP1 in the limb skeleton were generated by crossing MAGP1-flox mice (Mfap2lox/lox) with Prx1-Cre mice. Mfap2Prx\u2212/\u2212 mice did not show any changes in peripheral adiposity, hyperglycemia or insulin sensitivity, but did have increased bone length and cancellous bone loss that was comparable to the germline Mfap2\u2212/\u2212 knockout. Unlike the germline knockout, marrow adiposity, cortical bone thickness and bone strength in Mfap2Prx\u2212/\u2212 mice were normal. These findings implicate systemic metabolic dysfunction in the development of bone fragility in germline Mfap2\u2212/\u2212 mice. An unexpected finding of this study was the detection of MAGP1 protein in the Mfap2Prx\u2212/\u2212 hematopoietic bone marrow, despite the absence of MAGP1 protein in osseous bone matrix and absent Mfap2 transcript expression at both sites. This suggests MAGP1 from a secondary site may accumulate in the bone marrow, but not be incorporated into the bone matrix, during times of regional MAGP1 depletion.",

In condyles in newborn mice, the apical polymorphic/progenitor cell layer was ~10 cell layer-thick and expressed the articular matrix marker Tenascin-C (Tn-C), and the underlying thick cell layer expressed Tn-C as well as the chondrogenic master regulator Sox9. By 1\u202fmonth, condylar cartilage had gained its full width, but became thinner along its main longitudinal axis and displayed hypertrophic chondrocytes. By 3\u202fmonths, articular cartilage consisted of a 2\u20133 cell layer-thick zone of superficial cells and chondroprogenitors expressing both Tn-C and Sox9 and a bottom zone of chondrocytes displaying vertical matrix septa. EdU cell tracing in juvenile mice revealed that conversion of chondroprogenitors into chondrocytes and hypertrophic chondrocytes required about 48 and 72\u202fh, respectively. Notably, EdU injection in 3\u202fmonth-old mice labeled both progenitors and maturing chondrocytes by 96\u202fh. Conditional ablation of Ihh in juvenile/early adult mice compromised chondroprogenitor organization and function and led to reduced chondroprogenitor and chondrocyte proliferation. The phenotype of mutant condyles worsened over time as indicated by apoptotic chondrocyte incidence, ectopic chondrocyte hypertrophy, chondrocyte column derangement and subchondral bone deterioration. In micromass cultures of condylar apical cells, hedgehog (Hh) treatment stimulated chondrogenesis and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity, while treatment with HhAntag inhibited both. Our findings indicate that the chondroprogenitor layer is continuously engaged in condylar growth postnatally and its organization and functioning depend on hedgehog signaling.",

Several mutations in the LN domains cause LAMA2-deficient muscular dystrophy and LAMB2-deficient Pierson syndrome. These mutations may affect polymerization. A novel approach to identify the amino acid residues required for polymerization has been applied to an analysis of these and other laminin LN mutations. The approach utilizes laminin-nidogen chimeric fusion proteins that bind to recombinant non-polymerizing laminins to provide a missing functional LN domain. Single amino acid substitutions introduced into these chimeras were tested to determine if polymerization activity and the ability to assemble on cell surfaces were lost. Several laminin-deficient muscular dystrophy mutations, renal Pierson syndrome mutations, and Drosophila mutations causing defects of heart development were identified as ones causing loss of laminin polymerization. In addition, two novel residues required for polymerization were identified in the laminin \u03b31 LN domain.",

We describe here the localization of ECM molecules, in particular the laminin \u03b14, \u03b13 and \u03b15 containing isoforms in the bone marrow. Laminin 421 (composed of laminin \u03b14, \u03b22, \u03b31 chains) is identified as a major component of the bone marrow ECM, occurring abundantly surrounding venous sinuses and in a specialized reticular fiber network of the intersinusoidal spaces of murine bone marrow (BM) in close association with HSPC. Bone marrow from Lama4\u2212/\u2212 mice is significantly less efficient in reconstituting the hematopoietic system of irradiated wildtype (WT) recipients in competitive bone marrow transplantation assays and shows reduced colony formation in vitro. This is partially due to retention of Lin\u2212c-kit+Sca-1+CD48\u2212 long-term and short-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSC/ST-HSC) in the G0 phase of the cell cycle in Lama4\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow and hence a more quiescent phenotype. In addition, the extravasation of WT BM cells into Lama4\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow is impaired, influencing the recirculation of HSPC. Our data suggest that these effects are mediated by a compensatory expression of laminin \u03b15 containing isoforms (laminin 521/522) in Lama4\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow. Collectively, these intrinsic and extrinsic effects lead to reduced HSPC numbers in Lama4\u2212/\u2212 bone marrow and reduced hematopoietic potential.",

     "abstract": "Increased uptake of glucose, a general hallmark of malignant tumors, leads to an accumulation of intermediate metabolites of glycolysis. We investigated whether the high supply of these intermediates promotes their flow into UDP-sugars, and consequently into hyaluronan, a tumor-promoting matrix molecule. We quantified UDP-N-Acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) and UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) in human breast cancer biopsies, the levels of enzymes contributing to their synthesis, and their association with the hyaluronan accumulation in the tumor. The content of UDP-GlcUA was 4 times, and that of UDP-GlcNAc 12 times higher in the tumors as compared to normal glandular tissue obtained from breast reductions. The surge of UDP-GlcNAc correlated with an elevated mRNA expression of glutamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase 2 (GFAT2), one of the key enzymes in the biosynthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, and the expression of GFAT1 was also elevated. The contents of both UDP-sugars strongly correlated with tumor hyaluronan levels. Interestingly, hyaluronan content did not correlate with the mRNA levels of the hyaluronan synthases (HAS1\u20133), thus emphasizing the role of the UDP-sugar substrates of these enzymes. The UDP-sugars showed a trend to higher levels in ductal vs. lobular cancer subtypes. The results reveal for the first time a dramatic increase of UDP-sugars in breast cancer, and suggest that their high supply drives the accumulation of hyaluronan, a known promoter of breast cancer and other malignancies. In general, the study shows how the disturbed glucose metabolism typical for malignant tumors can influence cancer microenvironment through UDP-sugars and hyaluronan.",

     "abstract": "Mutations in COMP (cartilage oligomeric matrix protein) cause severe long bone shortening in mice and humans. Previously, we showed that massive accumulation of misfolded COMP in the ER of growth plate chondrocytes in our MT-COMP mouse model of pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) causes premature chondrocyte death and loss of linear growth. Premature chondrocyte death results from activation of oxidative stress and inflammation through the CHOP-ER pathway and is reduced by removing CHOP or by anti-inflammatory or antioxidant therapies. Although the mutant COMP chondrocyte pathologic mechanism is now recognized, the effect of mutant COMP on bone quality and joint health (laxity) is largely unknown. Applying multiple analytic approaches, we describe a novel mechanism by which the deleterious consequences of mutant COMP retention results in upregulation of miR-223 disturbing the adipogenesis - osteogenesis balance. This results in reduction in bone mineral density, bone quality, mechanical strength and subchondral bone thickness. These, in addition to abnormal patterns of ossification at the ends of the femoral bones likely contribute to precocious osteoarthritis (OA) of the hips and knees in the MT-COMP mouse and PSACH. Moreover, joint laxity is compromised by abnormally thin ligaments. Altogether, these novel findings align with the PSACH phenotype of delayed ossification and bone age, extreme joint laxity and joint erosion, and extend our understanding of the underlying processes that affect bone in PSACH. These results introduce a novel finding that miR-223 is involved in the ossification defect in MT-COMP mice making it a therapeutic target.",

Dichotomous outcomes in response to varied stroma-targeted therapies in cancer emphasize the need to disentangle the roles of heterogeneous fibroblast subsets in physiological and pathophysiological settings. In wound healing, fibrosis, and myriad tumor types, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) identify distinct, yet overlapping, activated fibroblast subsets. Prior studies established that FAPHi reactive fibroblasts and \u03b1SMAHi myofibroblasts can exert opposing influences in tumorigenesis. However, the factors that drive this phenotypic heterogeneity and the unique functional roles of these subsets have not been defined. We demonstrate that a convergence of ECM composition, elasticity, and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling governs activated fibroblast phenotypic heterogeneity. Furthermore, FAPHi reactive fibroblasts and \u03b1SMAHi myofibroblasts exhibited distinct gene expression signatures and functionality in vitro, illuminating potentially unique roles of activated fibroblast subsets in tissue remodeling.

FN also has heparin/heparan sulfate (HS) binding sites. Using HS-deficient CHO cells, we show that the addition of soluble heparin significantly increased the amount of FN matrix that these cells assemble. Sulfated HS glycosaminoglycan (GAG) mimetics similarly increased FN assembly and demonstrated a dependence on GAG sulfation. The length of the heparin chains also plays a role in assembly. Chains of sufficient length to bind to two FN molecules gave maximal stimulation of assembly whereas shorter heparin had less of an effect. Using a decellularized fibroblast matrix for proteolysis, detergent fractionation, and mass spectrometry, we found that the predominant domain within insoluble fibril fragments is FN's major heparin-binding domain HepII (modules III12\u201314). Multiple HepII domains bind simultaneously to a single heparin chain in size exclusion chromatography analyses. We propose a model in which heparin/HS binding to the HepII domain connects multiple FNs together to facilitate the formation of protein interactions for insoluble fibril assembly.",

     "abstract": "In this study we used a genetic extracellular matrix (ECM) disease to identify mechanisms associated with aggressive behavior of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). cSCC is one of the most common malignancies and usually has a good prognosis. However, some cSCCs recur or metastasize and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Known factors that are associated with aggressiveness of cSCCs include tumor grading, size, localization and microinvasive behavior. To investigate molecular mechanisms that influence biologic behavior we used global proteomic and histologic analyses of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of primary human cSCCs. We compared three groups: non-recurring, non-metastasizing low-risk sporadic cSCCs; metastasizing sporadic cSCCs; and cSCCs from patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). RDEB is a genetic skin blistering and ECM disease caused by collagen VII deficiency. Patients commonly suffer from high-risk early onset cSCCs that frequently metastasize. The results indicate that different processes are associated with formation of RDEB cSCCs compared to sporadic cSCCs. Sporadic cSCCs show signs of UV damage, whereas RDEB cSCCs have higher mutational rates and display tissue damage, inflammation and subsequent remodeling of the dermal ECM as tumor initiating factors. Interestingly the two high-risk groups \u2013 high-risk metastasizing sporadic cSCCs and RDEB cSCCs \u2013 are both associated with tissue damage and ECM remodeling in gene-ontology enrichment and Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins analyses. In situ histologic analyses validate these results. The high-risk cSCCs also show signatures of enhanced bacterial challenge. Histologic analyses confirm correlation of bacterial colonization with worse prognosis. Collectively, this unbiased study \u2013 performed directly on human patient material \u2013 reveals that common microenvironmental alterations linked to ECM remodeling and increased bacterial challenges are denominators of high-risk cSCCs. The proteins identified here could serve as potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets in high-risk cSCCs.",

Transmission electron microscopy showed intracellular disruption and cell-cell dysadhesion of keratinocytes in the lower epidermis.

However, a (pro-)collagen type I specific therapy remains difficult and its therapeutic abrogation may incur unwanted side effects. We therefore designed tetracycline-regulated procollagen alpha1(I) short hairpin (sh)RNA expressing mice that permit a highly efficient inducible knockdown of the procollagen alpha1(I) gene in activated (myo-)fibroblasts, to study the effect of induced procollagen type I deficiency. Transgenic mice were generated using recombinase-mediated integration in embryonic stem cells or zinc-finger nuclease-aided genomic targeting combined with miR30-shRNA technology.

Doxycycline treated mice showed an 80\u201390% suppression of procollagen alpha1(I) transcription and a 40\u201350% reduction in hepatic collagen accumulation. Procollagen alpha1(I) knockdown also downregulated procollagens type III, IV and VI and other fibrosis related parameters.

Uniquely among the C1q family members, the EMILIN1 gC1q presents only nine-stranded \u03b2-sandwich fold and the missing strand is substituted by a disordered 19-residue long segment spanning from Y927 to G945 at the apex of the gC1q domain. This unstructured loop exposes to the solvent the acidic residue E933, which plays a key role in the \u03b14\u03b21 integrin mediated interaction. Here, we experimentally determined that the three E933 residues (one from each monomer) are all required for ligand binding. By docking the NMR structure of the gC1q to a virtual \u03b14\u03b21 crystal structure based on the known structures of \u03b14\u03b27 and \u03b15\u03b21 integrins we built a model of \u03b14\u03b21-gC1q complex where three E933 residues are smoothly forced to coordinate the Mg2\u00a0+ ion at the \u03b2I MIDAS site of the integrin. By bringing the three E933 close in space, the trimeric supramolecular organization of gC1q allows the formation of a proper 3D geometry and suggests a quaternary-structure-dependent mode of interaction. Furthermore, we experimentally identified R904 as a synergistic residue for cell adhesion. Accordingly, the model showed that this residue is able to form potential stabilizing intra-chain salt bridges with residues E928 and E930. This mode of interaction likely accounts for a more stable and durable \u03b14\u03b21-gC1q interaction in comparison with the prototypic CS1 ligand.

In Apolipoprotein E (Apoe)-deficient mice Has3 expression is increased early during lesion formation when macrophages enter atherosclerotic plaques. Importantly, HAS3 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) was found to be regulated by interleukin 1 \u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in an NFkB dependent manner and blocking antibodies to IL-1\u03b2 abrogate Has3 expression in VSMC by activated macrophages. Has3/Apoe double deficient mice developed less atherosclerosis characterized by decreased Th1-cell responses, decreased IL-12 release, and decreased macrophage-driven inflammation.Inhibition of HAS3-dependent synthesis of HA dampens systemic Th1 cell polarization and reduces plaque inflammation.

Macrophage infiltration and the levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and HGF in the livers of Postn-deficient mice are significantly decreased compared with wild-type mice one day after PHx. In addition, overexpression of Postn leads to higher liver/body weight ratio and more Ki67-positive cells in the livers of mice and promotes hepatocyte proliferation in vitro. Moreover, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, biliary epithelial cells and hepatocytes can express Postn after PHx, and Postn deficiency impairs angiogenesis during liver regeneration.

Here, we investigate whether HA35 treatment enhances ZO-1 expression by direct interaction with intestinal epithelium in vitro and have identified the HA receptor responsible for HA35-mediated ZO-1 induction in colonic epithelium in vitro and in vivo. Our results reveal that HA35 treatment increases ZO-1 expression in mouse intestinal epithelial organoids, while large HA 2000\u00a0kDa is not internalized into the cells. Our immunofluorescence data indicate that layilin, but neither toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) nor CD44, mediate the HA35-induced ZO-1 expression in colonic epithelium in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, using layilin null mice we have determined that layilin mediates HA35 induction of ZO-1 in healthy mice and during dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Furthermore, we find that while ZO-1 expression levels are reduced, layilin expression levels are equivalent in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients and non-IBD controls.

     "abstract": "The small leucine-rich proteoglycan osteoglycin has been implicated in matrix homeostasis in different organs, including the ischemic heart. However, whether osteoglycin modulates cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis or inflammation in hypertensive heart disease and during aging remains unknown. Angiotensin-II-induced pressure overload increases cardiac osteoglycin expression, concomitant with the onset of inflammation and extracellular matrix deposition. Interestingly aging led to decreased cardiac levels of osteoglycin, yet absence of osteoglycin did not affect organ structure or cardiac function up to the age of 18\u00a0months. However, Angiotensin-II infusion in combination with aging resulted in exaggerated cardiac fibrosis and inflammation in the osteoglycin null mice as compared to wild-type mice, resulting in increased diastolic dysfunction as determined by magnetic resonance imaging. In vitro, stimulation of bone marrow derived macrophages from osteoglycin null mice with Angiotensin-II resulted in significantly higher levels of ICAM-1 as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines IL-1\u03b2 and MCP-1 as compared to WT cells. Further, stimulation of human cardiac fibroblasts with osteoglycin reduced cell proliferation and inhibited TGF-\u03b2 induced collagen gene expression. In mouse cardiac tissue, osteoglycin expression inversely correlated with TGF-\u03b2 expression and in cardiac biopsies of aortic stenosis patients, osteoglycin expression is significantly higher than in control biopsies. Interestingly, osteoglycin levels were higher in patients with less severe myocardial fibrosis and overall in the aortic stenosis patients osteoglycin levels negatively correlated with collagen content in the myocardium. In conclusion, osteoglycin expression is increased in the heart in response to pressure overload and its absence results in increased cardiac inflammation and fibrosis resulting in increased diastolic dysfunction.",

In addition to their crucial role in tissue cohesion and biomechanics, they chiefly regulate various important biological processes during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis and repair. In essence, ECM proteins were defined as secreted proteins that localized in the extracellular space. The characterization of the human and mouse matrisomes provided the first definition of ECM actors by comprehensively listing ECM proteins and classified them into categories. Because zebrafish is becoming a popular model to study ECM biology, we sought to characterize the zebrafish matrisome using an in-silico gene-orthology-based approach. We report the identification of 1002 genes encoding the in-silico zebrafish matrisome. Using independent validations, we provide evidence for the robustness of the orthology-based approach. Moreover, we evaluated the orthology relationships between human and zebrafish genes at the whole-genome and matrisome levels and showed that the different categories of ECM genes are differentially subjected to evolutionary pressure. Last, we illustrate how the zebrafish matrisome list can be employed to annotate big data using the example of a previously published proteomic study of the skeletal ECM. The establishment of the zebrafish matrisome will undoubtedly facilitate the analysis of ECM components in \u201c-omic\u201d data sets.",

     "abstract": "Tendinopathy is a widespread and unresolved clinical challenge, in which associated pain and hampered mobility present a major cause for work-related disability. Tendinopathy associates with a change from a healthy tissue with aligned extracellular matrix (ECM) and highly polarized cells that are connected head-to-tail, towards a diseased tissue with a disorganized ECM and randomly distributed cells, scar-like features that are commonly attributed to poor innate regenerative capacity of the tissue. A fundamental clinical dilemma with this scarring process is whether treatment strategies should focus on healing the affected (disorganized) tissue or strengthen the remaining healthy (anisotropic) tissue. The question was thus asked whether the intrinsic remodeling capacity of tendon-derived cells depends on the organization of the 3D extracellular matrix (isotropic vs anisotropic). Progress in this field is hampered by the lack of suitable in vitro tissue platforms. We aimed at filling this critical gap by creating and exploiting a next generation tissue platform that mimics aspects of the tendon scarring process; cellular response to a gradient in tissue organization from isotropic (scarred/non-aligned) to highly anisotropic (unscarred/aligned) was studied, as was a transient change from isotropic towards highly anisotropic. Strikingly, cells residing in an \u2018unscarred\u2019 anisotropic tissue indicated superior remodeling capacity (increased gene expression levels of collagen, matrix metalloproteinases MMPs, tissue inhibitors of MMPs), when compared to their \u2018scarred\u2019 isotropic counterparts. A numerical model then supported the hypothesis that cellular remodeling capacity may correlate to cellular alignment strength. This in turn may have improved cellular communication, and could thus relate to the more pronounced connexin43 gap junctions observed in anisotropic tissues. In conclusion, increased tissue anisotropy was observed to enhance the cellular potential for functional remodeling of the matrix. This may explain the poor regenerative capacity of tenocytes in chronic tendinopathy, where the pathological process has resulted in ECM disorganization. Additionally, it lends support to treatment strategies that focus on strengthening the remaining healthy tissue, rather than regenerating scarred tissue.",

Collagens represent the most abundant matrix proteins and provide for the overall stiffness and resilience of tissues. The structural changes of collagens and their susceptibility to degradation are associated with skin wrinkling, bone and cartilage deterioration, as well as cardiovascular and respiratory malfunctions. Here, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are major contributors to tissue remodeling and collagen degradation. During aging, collagens are modified by mineralization, accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), and the depletion of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which affect fiber stability and their susceptibility to MMP-mediated degradation. We found a reduced collagenolysis in mineralized and AGE-modified collagen fibers when compared to native fibrillar collagen. GAGs had no effect on MMP-mediated degradation of collagen. In general, MMP digestion led to a reduction in the mechanical strength of native and modified collagen fibers. Successive fiber degradation with MMPs and the cysteine-dependent collagenase, cathepsin K (CatK), resulted in their complete degradation. In contrast, MMP-generated fragments were not or only poorly cleaved by non-collagenolytic cathepsins such as cathepsin V (CatV). In conclusion, our data indicate that aging and disease-associated collagen modifications reduce tissue remodeling by MMPs and decrease the structural and mechanic integrity of collagen fibers, which both may exacerbate extracellular matrix pathology.",

     "abstract": "Thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis whose expression is dynamically regulated following injury. In the present study, it is shown that HIF-1\u03b1 represses TSP2 transcription. Specifically, in vitro studies demonstrate that the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG or hypoxia decrease TSP2 expression in fibroblasts. This effect is shown to be via a transcriptional mechanism as hypoxia does not alter TSP2 mRNA stability and this effect requires the TSP2 promoter. In addition, the documented repressive effect of nitric oxide (NO) on TSP2 is shown to be non-canonical and involves stabilization of hypoxia inducible factor-1a (HIF-1\u03b1). The regulation of TSP2 by hypoxia is supported by the in vivo observation that TSP2 has spatiotemporal expression distinct from regions of hypoxia in gastrocnemius muscle following murine hindlimb ischemia (HLI). A role for TSP2 regulation by HIF-1\u03b1 is supported by the dysregulation of TSP2 expression in SM22\u03b1-cre HIF-1\u03b1 KO mice following HLI. Indeed, there is a reduction in blood flow recovery in the SM22a-cre HIF-1\u03b1 KO mice compared to littermate controls following HLI surgery, associated with impaired recovery and increased TSP2 levels. Moreover, SM22\u03b1-cre HIF-1\u03b1 KO smooth muscle cells mice have increased TSP2 mRNA levels that persist in hypoxia. These findings identify a novel, ischemia-induced pro-angiogenic mechanism involving the transcriptional repression of TSP2 by HIF-1\u03b1.",

     "abstract": "After skin injury fibroblasts migrate into the wound and transform into contractile, extracellular matrix-producing myofibroblasts to promote skin repair. Persistent activation of myofibroblasts can cause excessive fibrotic reactions, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. We used SMA-GFP transgenic mice to study myofibroblast recruitment and activation in skin wounds. Myofibroblasts were initially recruited to wounds three days post injury, their number reached a maximum after seven days and subsequently declined. Expression profiling showed that 1749 genes were differentially expressed in sorted myofibroblasts from wounds seven days post injury. Most of these genes were linked with the extracellular region and cell periphery including genes encoding for extracellular matrix proteins. A unique panel of core matrisome and matrisome-associated genes was differentially expressed in myofibroblasts and several genes not yet known to be linked to myofibroblast-mediated wound healing were found (e.g. Col24a1, Podnl1, Bvcan, Tinagl1, Thbs3, Adamts16, Adamts19, Cxcl's, Ccl's). In addition, a complex network of G protein-coupled signaling events was regulated in myofibroblasts (e.g. Adcy1, Plbc4, Gnas). Hence, this first characterization of a myofibroblast-specific expression profile at the peak of in situ granulation tissue formation provides important insights into novel target genes that may control excessive ECM deposition during fibrotic reactions.",

The aim of this study was to endow the cell-adhesive activity of laminin-511 on collagen matrices, thereby fabricating collagen-based culture scaffolds for stem cells with defined composition. To achieve this goal, we utilized the collagen-binding domain (CBD) of fibronectin to immobilize LM511E8 on collagen matrices. CBD was attached to the N-termini of individual laminin chains (\u03b15E8, \u03b21E8, \u03b31E8), producing LM511E8s having one, two, or three CBDs. While LM511E8 did not bind to collagen, CBD-attached LM511E8s (CBD-LM511E8s) exhibited significant collagen-binding activity, dependent on the number of attached CBDs. Human iPS cells were cultured on collagen-coated plates preloaded with CBD-LM511E8s. Although iPS cells did not attach or grow on collagen, they robustly proliferated on CBD-LM511E8-loaded collagen matrices, similar to the case with LM511E8-coated plates. Importantly, iPS cells proliferated and yielded round-shaped colonies even on collagen gels preloaded with CBD-LM511E8s. These results demonstrate that CBD-attached laminin E8 fragments are promising tools for fabrication of collagen-based matrices having the cell-adhesive activity of laminins.",

     "publication date": "01-2018",
     "abstract": "Heparanase is an endoglucuronidase that uniquely cleaves the heparan sulfate side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This activity ultimately alters the structural integrity of the ECM and basement membrane that becomes more prone to cellular invasion by metastatic cancer cells and cells of the immune system. In addition, enzymatically inactive heparanase was found to facilitate the proliferation and survival of cancer cells by activation of signaling molecules such as Akt, Src, signal transducer and activation of transcription (Stat), and epidermal growth factor receptor. This function is thought to be executed by the C-terminal domain of heparanase (8c), because over expression of this domain in cancer cells accelerated signaling cascades and tumor growth. We have used the regulatory elements of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) to direct the expression heparanase and the C-domain (8c) to the mammary gland epithelium of transgenic mice. Here, we report that mammary gland branching morphogenesis is increased in MMTV-heparanase and MMTV-8c mice, associating with increased Akt, Stat5 and Src phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that the growth of tumors generated by mouse breast cancer cells and the resulting lung metastases are enhanced in MMTV-heparanase mice, thus supporting the notion that heparanase contributed by the tumor microenvironment (i.e., normal mammary epithelium) plays a decisive role in tumorigenesis. Remarkably, MMTV-8c mice develop spontaneous tumors in their mammary and salivary glands. Although this occurs at low rates and requires long latency, it demonstrates decisively the pro-tumorigenic capacity of heparanase signaling.",

     "abstract": "The heparan sulfate-degrading enzyme heparanase promotes the progression of many cancers by driving tumor cell proliferation, metastasis and angiogenesis. Heparanase accomplishes this via multiple mechanisms including its recently described effect on enhancing biogenesis of tumor exosomes. Because we recently discovered that heparanase expression is upregulated in myeloma cells that survive chemotherapy, we were prompted to investigate the impact of anti-myeloma drugs on exosome biogenesis. When myeloma cells were exposed to the commonly utilized anti-myeloma drugs bortezomib, carfilzomib or melphalan, exosome secretion by the cells was dramatically enhanced. These chemotherapy-induced exosomes (chemoexosomes) have a proteome profile distinct from cells not exposed to drug including a dramatic elevation in the level of heparanase present as exosome cargo. The chemoexosome heparanase was not found inside the chemoexosome, but was present on the exosome surface where it was capable of degrading heparan sulfate embedded within an extracellular matrix. When exposed to myeloma cells, chemoexosomes transferred their heparanase cargo to those cells, enhancing their heparan sulfate degrading activity and leading to activation of ERK signaling and an increase in shedding of the syndecan-1 proteoglycan. Exposure of chemoexosomes to macrophages enhanced their secretion of TNF-\u03b1, an important myeloma growth factor. Moreover, chemoexosomes stimulated macrophage migration and this effect was blocked by H1023, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits heparanase enzymatic activity. These data suggest that anti-myeloma therapy ignites a burst of exosomes having a high level of heparanase that remodels extracellular matrix and alters tumor and host cell behaviors that likely contribute to chemoresistance and eventual patient relapse.We find that anti-myeloma chemotherapy dramatically stimulates secretion of exosomes and alters exosome composition. Exosomes secreted during therapy contain high levels of heparanase on their surface that can degrade ECM and also can be transferred to both tumor and host cells, altering their behavior in ways that may enhance tumor survival and progression.",

     "abstract": "Myofibroblast-mediated fibrosis is important in the pathophysiology of diseases in most organs. The cornea, the transparent anterior wall of the eye that functions to focus light on the retina, is commonly affected by fibrosis and provides an optimal model due to its simplicity and accessibility. Severe injuries to the cornea, including infection, surgery, and trauma, may trigger the development of myofibroblasts and fibrosis in the normally transparent connective tissue stroma. Ultrastructural studies have demonstrated that defective epithelial basement membrane (EBM) regeneration after injury underlies the development of myofibroblasts from both bone marrow- and keratocyte-derived precursor cells in the cornea. Defective EBM permits epithelium-derived transforming growth factor beta, platelet-derived growth factor, and likely other modulators, to penetrate the stroma at sustained levels necessary to drive the development of vimentin\u00a0+ alpha-smooth muscle actin\u00a0+ desmin\u00a0+ (V\u00a0+\u00a0A\u00a0+\u00a0D\u00a0+) mature myofibroblasts and promote their persistence. Defective versus normal EBM regeneration likely relates to the severity of the stromal injury and a resulting decrease in fibroblasts (keratocytes) and their contribution of EBM components, including laminin alpha-3 and nidogen-2. Corneal fibrosis may resolve over a period of months to years if the inciting injury is eliminated through keratocyte-facilitated regeneration of normal EBM, ensuing apoptosis of myofibroblasts, and reorganization of disordered extracellular matrix by repopulating keratocytes. We hypothesize the corneal model of fibrosis associated with defective BM regeneration and myofibroblast development after epithelial or parenchymal injury may be a paradigm for the development of fibrosis in other organs where chronic injury or defective BM underlies the pathophysiology of disease.",

Progranulin, a secreted growth factor, strongly binds the heparin-sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, and counteracts its biological activity. We established that progranulin acts as an autocrine growth factor and promotes prostate cancer cell motility, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. Progranulin was overexpressed in prostate cancer tissues vis-\u00e0-vis non-neoplastic tissues supporting the hypothesis that progranulin may play a key role in prostate cancer progression. However, progranulin's mode of action is not well understood and proteins regulating progranulin signaling have not been identified. Sortilin, a single-pass type I transmembrane protein of the Vps10 family, binds progranulin in neurons and targets progranulin for lysosomal degradation. Significantly, in DU145 and PC3 cells, we detected very low levels of sortilin associated with high levels of progranulin production and enhanced motility. Restoring sortilin expression decreased progranulin levels, inhibited motility and anchorage-independent growth and destabilized Akt. These results demonstrated a critical role for sortilin in regulating progranulin and suggest that sortilin loss may contribute to prostate cancer progression. Here, we provide the novel observation that progranulin downregulated sortilin protein levels independent of transcription. Progranulin induced sortilin ubiquitination, internalization via clathrin-dependent endocytosis and sorting into early endosomes for lysosomal degradation. Collectively, these results constitute a regulatory feed-back mechanism whereby sortilin downregulation ensures sustained progranulin-mediated oncogenesis.",

The development of blood vessels is tightly regulated by a plethora of cytokines, endothelial cell (EC) receptors and extracellular matrix (ECM) components. In this context, we have shown that Multimerin 2 (MMRN2), an ECM molecule specifically secreted by ECs, exerts angiostatic functions by binding VEGFA and other pro-angiogenic cytokines. Here, we demonstrate that during angiogenic stimuli MMRN2 mRNA levels significantly decrease. Furthermore, we provide evidence that MMRN2 is processed by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including MMP-9 and, to a lesser degree, by MMP-2. This proteolytic cleavage correlates with an increased migration of ECs. Accordingly, MMRN2 down-regulation is associated with an increased number of EC pseudopodia at the migrating front and this effect is attenuated using specific MMP-9 inhibitors. The down-modulation of MMRN2 occurs also in the context of tumor-associated angiogenesis. Immunofluorescence performed on tumor sections indicate a broad co-localization of MMP-9 and MMRN2, suggesting that the molecule may be extensively remodeled during tumor angiogenesis. Given the altered expression in tumors and the key role of MMRN2 in blood vessel function, we postulate that analyses of its expression may serve as a marker to predict the efficacy of the treatments. In conclusion, these data further support the role of MMRN2 as a key molecule regulating EC function and sprouting angiogenesis.",

The EVs secreted by MSCs were isolated by differential centrifugation and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis.

Hyaluronan synthesis of hMSCs was induced by lipopolysaccharide and inhibited by RNA interference and 4-methylumbelliferone.

Additionally, they secreted HA-coated EVs carrying mRNAs for CD44 and all HAS isoforms. The results show that stem cells have a strong intrinsic potential for HA synthesis and EV secretion, and the amount of HA carried on EVs reflects the HA content of the original cells.

Similar networks have been identified previously during in vivo corneal wound healing. In this study, we investigate the role of fibronectin in mediating this mechanism of collective cell spreading, migration and patterning.To assess cell spreading, corneal fibroblasts were plated within fibrillar collagen or fibrin matrices. To assess migration, compacted cell-populated collagen matrices were nested inside cell-free fibrin matrices. Constructs were cultured in serum-free media containing PDGF, with or without RGD peptide, anti-\u03b15 or anti-fibronectin blocking antibodies. In some experiments, LifeAct and fluorescent fibronectin were used to allow dynamic assessment of cell-induced fibronectin reorganization. 3-D and 4-D imaging were used to assess cell mechanical behavior, connectivity, F-actin, \u03b15 integrin and fibronectin organization.Corneal fibroblasts within 3-D fibrin matrices formed an interconnected network that was lined with cell-secreted fibronectin. Live cell imaging demonstrated that fibronectin tracks were formed at the leading edge of spreading and migrating cells. Furthermore, fibroblasts preferentially migrated through fibronectin tracks laid down by other cells. Interfering with cell-fibronectin binding with RGD, anti \u03b15 integrin or anti fibronectin antibodies inhibited cell spreading and migration through fibrin, but did not affect cell behavior in collagen.In this study, a novel mode of cell patterning was identified in which corneal fibroblasts secrete and attach to fibronectin via \u03b15\u03b21 integrin to facilitate spreading and migration within 3-D fibrin matrices, resulting in the formation of localized fibronectin tracks. Other cells use these fibronectin tracks as conduits, resulting in an interconnected cell-fibronectin network.",

     "abstract": "The small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs), decorin and biglycan, are key regulators of collagen fibril and matrix assembly. The goal of this work was to elucidate the roles of decorin and biglycan in tendon homeostasis. Our central hypothesis is that decorin and biglycan expression in the mature tendon would be critical for the maintenance of the structural and mechanical properties of healthy tendons. Defining the function(s) of these SLRPs in tendon homeostasis requires that effects in the mature tendon be isolated from their influence on development. Thus, we generated an inducible knockout mouse model that permits genetic ablation of decorin and biglycan expression in the mature tendon, while maintaining normal expression during development. Decorin and biglycan expression were knocked out in the mature patellar tendon with the subsequent turnover of endogenous SLRPs deposited prior to induction. The acute absence of SLRP expression was associated with changes in fibril structure with a general shift to larger diameter fibrils in the compound knockout tendons, together with fibril diameter heterogeneity. In addition, tendon mechanical properties were altered. Compared to wild-type controls, acute ablation of both genes resulted in failure of the tendon at lower loads, decreased stiffness, a trend towards decreased dynamic modulus, as well as a significant increase in percent relaxation and tissue viscosity. Collagen fiber realignment was also increased with a delayed and slower in response to load in the absence of expression. These structural and functional changes in response to an acute loss of decorin and biglycan expression in the mature tendon demonstrate a significant role for these SLRPs in adult tendon homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "Even though the role of estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1) in the modulation of breast cancer cells' behavior is thoroughly studied, the biological functions of its isoform, ER\u03b2, are less elucidated. The suppression of ER\u03b2 in the aggressive ER\u03b1-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells resulted in the inhibition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and major changes in the basic functional properties and expression levels of certain matrix components of breast cancer cells. This arrest in metastatic potential of breast cancer cells suggests the contribution of ER\u03b2 in the induction of a more aggressive phenotype in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. The epigenetic alterations are responsible for the ability of the tumor cells to metastasize. Here, we report for the first time that the suppression of ER\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells leads to significant changes in the expression profiles of specific microRNAs, including miR-10b, miR-200b and miR-145. Growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells in estrogen-free medium has a diverse impact on miRNA expression and the behavior of these cells, suggesting the specific effect of estradiol on the miRNA expression profile depending on the ER status of breast cancer cells. Enhanced miR-10b expression or silencing of miR-145 clearly revealed that these microRNAs can regulate the functional properties, EMT program and the expression of major matrix components known to be implicated in breast cancer aggressiveness. Our data revealed that miR-10b is strongly implicated in the regulation of functional properties, EMT program and Erk1/2 signaling in shER\u03b2 MDA-MB-231 cells, thus affecting the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, including syndecan-1, proteolytic behavior, especially MMP2, MMP7 and MMP9 expression and subsequently the aggressiveness of these cells. Accordingly, the inhibition of miR-145 expression significantly increased the aggressiveness of shER\u03b2 MDA-MB-231 cells and induced EMT. Moreover, miR-145 inhibition resulted in important changes in the gene and protein levels of ECM mediators, such as HER2 and several MMPs, whereas it significantly increased the phosphorylated levels of Erk1/2 kinases in these cells, suggesting the crucial role of miR-145 in this signaling pathway. These novel results suggest that the alterations in cell behavior and in ECM composition caused by the suppression of ER\u03b2 in MDA-MB-231 cells are closely related to certain epigenetic miRNA-induced alterations. Targeting the ER\u03b2-regulated miR-10b and miR-145 is a promising tool for diagnosis and pharmaceutical targeting in breast cancer.",

Moreover, CD93 is highly expressed in the endothelial cells of tumor blood vessel and faintly expressed in the non-proliferating endothelium. Much evidence suggests that CD93 mediates adhesion in the endothelium. Here we identify Multimerin 2 (MMRN2), a pan-endothelial extracellular matrix protein, as a specific ligand for CD93. We found that CD93 and MMRN2 are co-expressed in the blood vessels of various human tumors. Moreover, disruption of the CD93-MMRN2 interaction reduced endothelial cell adhesion and migration, making the interaction of CD93 with MMRN2 an ideal target to block pathological angiogenesis. Model structures and docking studies served to envisage the region of CD93 and MMRN2 involved in the interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis identified different residue hotspots either directly or indirectly involved in the binding. We propose a molecular model in which the coiled-coil domain of MMRN2 is engaged by F238 of CD93. Altogether, these studies identify the key interaction surfaces of the CD93-MMRN2 complex and provide a framework for exploring how to inhibit angiogenesis by hindering the CD93-MMRN2 interaction.",

Nearly all patients with severe RDEB develop highly metastatic squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) which are the main cause of death. Accumulating evidence from a murine RDEB model and human RDEB cells demonstrates that lack of C7 also directly alters the wound healing process. Non-healing RDEB wounds are characterized by increased inflammation, high transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) levels and activity, and are heavily populated by myofibroblasts responsible for enhanced fibrogenesis and matrix stiffness. These changes make the RDEB stroma a microenvironment prone to cancer initiation, where cells with features of cancer-associated fibroblasts are found.

In this exploratory study, we used a targeted proteomics approach to follow the progression of matrix degradation in response to mechanical damage and cytokine treatment of human knee cartilage explants, and thereby to study potential molecular biomarkers. This proteomics approach allowed us to unambiguously identify and quantify multiple peptides and proteins in the cartilage medium and explants upon treatment with \u00b1\u00a0injurious compression \u00b1\u00a0cytokines, treatments that mimic the earliest events in post-traumatic OA. We followed degradation of different protein domains, e.g., G1/G2/G3 of aggrecan, by measuring representative peptides of matrix proteins released into the medium at 7 time points throughout the 21-day culture period. COMP neo-epitopes, which were previously identified in the synovial fluid of knee injury/OA patients, were also released by these human cartilage explants treated with cyt and cyt\u00a0+\u00a0inj. The absence of collagen pro-peptides and elevated levels of specific COMP and COL3A1 neo-epitopes after human knee trauma may be relevant as potential biomarkers for post-traumatic OA. This model system thereby enables study of the kinetics of cartilage degradation and the identification of biomarkers within cartilage explants and those released to culture medium.

Syn4 knockdown was performed in order to address its role in endothelial cells (EC) behavior. Normal EC and shRNA-Syn4-EC cells were studied comparatively using complementary confocal, super-resolution and non-linear microscopic techniques. Confocal and super-resolution microscopy revealed that Syn4 knockdown alters the level and arrangement of essential proteins for focal adhesion, evidenced by the decoupling of vinculin from F-actin filaments. Furthermore, Syn4 knockdown alters the actin network leading to filopodial protrusions connected by VE-cadherin\u2013rich junction. shRNA-Syn4-EC showed reduced adhesion and increased migration. Also, Syn4 silencing alters cell cycle as well as cell proliferation. Moreover, the ability of EC to form tube-like structures in matrigel is reduced when Syn4 is silenced. Together, the results suggest a mechanism in which Syndecan-4 acts as a central mediator that bridges fibronectin, integrin and intracellular components (actin and vinculin) and once silenced, the cytoskeleton protein network is disrupted.

     "abstract": "The mesothelium is a membrane that forms the lining of several body cavities. It is composed of simple squamous mesothelial cells that secrete a glycosaminoglycan-rich lubricating fluid between inner organs. One of the most abundant glycosaminoglycans of those fluids is hyaluronan, which is synthesized on a plasma membrane and especially on apical filopodia of cultured cells. Our recent study showed that similar hyaluronan-rich protrusions are found in mesothelial lining in vivo, which suggests that hyaluronan synthesis in plasma membrane protrusions is a general process. However, the mesothelial lining was negative for the hyaluronan receptor CD44 while in many previous studies cultured mesothelial cells have been shown to express CD44. To further explore these findings we induced epithelial to mesenchymal transition in primary rat mesothelial cells by EGF-treatment and scratch wounding. Surprisingly, the results showed that at a normal epithelial, confluent stage the mesothelial cells are negative for CD44, but EMT induced by EGF or wounding activates CD44 expression and the whole hyaluronan synthesis machinery. In addition to typical EMT-like morphological changes, the growth of apical filopodia and budding of extracellular vesicles (EVs) were induced. In summary, the results of this study show that the activation of hyaluronan synthesis machinery, especially the expression of CD44 is strongly associated with EMT induced by EGF and wounding in mesothelial cells. Moreover, EMT enhances the secretion of EVs that carry CD44 and hyaluronan, which may be important regulators in EV interactions with their targets and ECM remodeling. The results of the present study also suggest that CD44 is a potential marker for EVs, especially those secreted from cells during tissue repair and pathological processes.",

     "abstract": "Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a large, non-sulfated glucosaminoglycan abundantly present at sites where fibrin is also formed (during wound healing, in arterial restenotic lesions and eroded atherosclerotic plaques). The aim of the present study was to characterize the structure of composite fibrin-HA clots with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), pressure-driven permeation and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and their viscoelastic properties with an oscillation rheometer. In addition the efficiency of fibrinolysis in these clots was investigated by kinetic turbidimetric and chromogenic assays for dissolution of fibrin and plasminogen activation by tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA). Fibrin formed in the presence of native (1500\u00a0kDa) HA and its 500\u00a0kDa fragments had thicker fibers and larger pores according to the SEM and clot permeation data, whereas the 25\u00a0kDa HA fragments had only minor effects. SAXS evidenced a mild disarrangement of protofibrils. These structural alterations suggest that HA modifies the pattern of fibrin polymerization favouring lateral association of protofibrils over formation of branching points. Rheometer data showed softer fibrin structures formed with 1500\u00a0kDa and 500\u00a0kDa HA and these clots presented with lower dynamic viscosity values and lower critical stress values at gel/fluid transition. tPA-catalysed plasminogen activation was markedly inhibited by HA, both in free solution and on the surface of fibrin clots, in the presence and in the absence of 6-aminohexanoate suggesting a kringle-independent mechanism. HA of 1500 and 500\u00a0kDa size prolonged clot lysis with both plasmin and tPA and this inhibition was kringle-mediated, because it was abolished by 6-aminohexanoate and was not observed with des-(kringle1\u20134)-plasmin. Our data suggest that HA size-dependently modifies the pattern of fibrin polymerization with consequent inhibition of fibrinolysis. At sites of tissue injury and inflammation, HA could stabilize fibrin through modification of its structure and lysibility.",

HSAT\u00a0+ has long been thought to act as an endogenous anticoagulant; however, coagulation was normal in Hs3st1\u2212/\u2212 mice that have greatly reduced HSAT\u00a0+ (HajMohammadi et al., 2003). This finding indicates that HSAT\u00a0+ is not essential for AT's anticoagulant activity. To determine if HSAT\u00a0+ is involved in AT's poorly understood inflammomodulatory activities, Hs3st1\u2212/\u2212 and Hs3st1+/+ mice were subjected to a model of acute septic shock. Compared with Hs3st1+/+ mice, Hs3st1\u2212/\u2212 mice were more susceptible to LPS-induced death due to an increased sensitivity to TNF. For Hs3st1+/+ mice, AT treatment reduced LPS-lethality, reduced leukocyte firm adhesion to endothelial cells, and dilated isolated coronary arterioles. Conversely, for Hs3st1\u2212/\u2212 mice, AT induced the opposite effects. Thus, in the context of acute inflammation, HSAT\u00a0+ selectively mediates AT's anti-inflammatory activity; in the absence of HSAT\u00a0+, AT's pro-inflammatory effects predominate. To explore if the anti-inflammatory action of HSAT\u00a0+ also protects against a chronic vascular-inflammatory disease, atherosclerosis, we conducted a human candidate-gene association study on >\u00a02000 coronary catheterization patients. Bioinformatic analysis of the HS3ST1 gene identified an intronic SNP, rs16881446, in a putative transcriptional regulatory region. The rs16881446G/G genotype independently associated with the severity of coronary artery disease and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events. In primary endothelial cells, the rs16881446G allele associated with reduced HS3ST1 expression. Together with the mouse data, this leads us to conclude that the HS3ST1 gene is required for AT's anti-inflammatory activity that appears to protect against acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.",

We conclude that cell adhesion results from binding of integrin-containing adhesion suprastructures to the non-collagenous fibril periphery but not to the collagenous fibril cores. The biological importance of the well-investigated recognition of collagen molecules by integrins is unknown. Possible scenarios may include fibrillogenesis, fibril degradation and/or phagocytosis, recruitment of cells to remodeling sites, or molecular signaling across cytoplasmic membranes. In these circumstances, collagen molecules may lack a fibrillar organization.

HA accumulation and expression of the HA receptors CD44 and RHAMM are highest during gestation when gland remodeling, lateral branch infilling and lobulo-alveoli formation is active. Molecular weight analyses show that approximately 98% of HA at all stages of morphogenesis is >\u00a0300\u00a0kDa. Low levels of 7\u2013114\u00a0kDa HA fragments are also detected and in particular the accumulation of 7\u201321\u00a0kDa HA fragments are significantly higher during gestation than other morphogenetic stages (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Using these in vivo results as a guide, in culture analyses of mammary epithelial cell lines (EpH4 and NMuMG) were performed to determine the roles of high molecular weight, 7\u201321\u00a0kDa (10\u00a0kDa MWavg) and HA receptors in EGF-induced branching morphogenesis. Results of these assays show that while HA synthesis is required for branching and 10\u00a0kDa HA fragments strongly stimulate branching, the activity of HA decreases with increasing molecular weight and 500\u00a0kDa HA strongly inhibits this morphogenetic process. The response to 10\u00a0kDa HA requires RHAMM function and genetic deletion of RHAMM transiently blunts lateral branching in vivo. Collectively, these results reveal distinct roles for HA polymer size in modulating growth factor induced mammary gland branching and implicates these polymers in both the expansion and sculpting of the mammary tree during gestation.",

This study determined whether the actin polymerization based signaling pathway, myocardin-related transcription factor-a (MRTF-A) is involved in regulating this contractile phenotype. Serial passaging of chondrocytes in monolayer culture to passage 2 resulted in increased gene and protein expression of the contractile molecules alpha-smooth muscle actin, transgelin and vinculin compared to non-passaged, primary cells. This resulted in a functional change as passaged 2, but not primary, chondrocytes were capable of contracting type I collagen gels in a stress-relaxed contraction assay. These changes were associated with increased actin polymerization and MRTF-A nuclear localization. The involvement of actin was demonstrated by latrunculin B depolymerization of actin which reversed these changes. Alternatively cytochalasin D which activates MRTF-A increased gene and protein expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, transgelin and vinculin, whereas CCG1423 which deactivates MRTF-A decreased these molecules. The involvement of MRTF-A signaling was confirmed by gene silencing of MRTF or its co-factor serum response factor. Knockdown experiments revealed downregulation of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and transgelin gene and protein expression, and inhibition of gel contraction. These findings demonstrate that passaged chondrocytes acquire a contractile phenotype and that this change is modulated by the actin-MRTF-A-serum response factor signaling pathway.",

Remodeling is thought to impair cardiac mechanotransduction, but the contribution of specific BM components to age-related lateral communication between cardiomyocytes is unclear. Using a genetically tractable, rapidly aging model with sufficient cardiac genetic homology and morphology, e.g. Drosophila melanogaster, we observed differential regulation of BM collagens between laboratory strains, correlating with changes in muscle physiology leading to cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, we sought to understand the extent to which BM proteins modulate contractile function during aging. Cardiac-restricted knockdown of ECM genes Pericardin, Laminin A, and Viking in Drosophila prevented age-associated heart tube restriction and increased contractility, even under viscous load. Most notably, reduction of Laminin A expression correlated with an overall preservation of contractile velocity with age and extension of organismal lifespan. Global heterozygous knockdown confirmed these data, which provides new evidence of a direct link between BM homeostasis, contractility, and maintenance of lifespan.",

In particular, we have found that HA35 induces the expression of tight junction protein zonula occludens (ZO)-1 in both healthy and Citrobacter infected mice, as demonstrated by immunoflurorescence and Western blot analyses. Furthermore, we determined that HA35 treatment enhances ZO-1 expression and reduces intestinal permeability at the early stages of dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Together, our data demonstrate that the expression and functionality of tight junctions, are increased by HA35 treatment, suggesting a novel mechanism for the protection from Citrobacter infection.",

     "abstract": "Aortic valve disease (AVD) is one of the leading causes of cardiovascular mortality. Abnormal expression of hyaluronan (HA) and its synthesizing/degrading enzymes have been observed during latent AVD however, the mechanism of impaired HA homeostasis prior to and after the onset of AVD remains unexplored. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF\u03b2) pathway defects and biomechanical dysfunction are hallmarks of AVD, however their association with altered HA regulation is understudied. Expression of HA homeostatic markers was evaluated in diseased human aortic valves and TGF\u03b21-cultured porcine aortic valve tissues using histology, immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. Further, porcine valve interstitial cell cultures were stretched (using Flexcell) and simultaneously treated with exogenous TGF\u03b21\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0inhibitors for activated Smad2/3 (SB431542) and ERK1/2 (U0126) pathways, and differential HA regulation was assessed using qRT-PCR. Pathological heavy chain HA together with abnormal regional expression of the enzymes HAS2, HYAL1, KIAA1199, TSG6 and I\u03b1I was demonstrated in calcified valve tissues identifying the collapse of HA homeostatic machinery during human AVD. Heightened TSG6 activity likely preceded the end-stage of disease, with the existence of a transitional, pre-calcific phase characterized by HA dysregulation. TGF\u03b21 elicited a fibrotic remodeling response in porcine aortic valves similar to human disease pathology, with increased collagen and HYAL to HAS ratio, and site-specific abnormalities in the expression of CD44 and RHAMM receptors. Further in these porcine valves, expression of HAS2 and HYAL1 was found to be differentially regulated by the Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 pathways, and CD44 expression was highly responsive to biomechanical strain. Leveraging the regulatory pathways that control both HA maintenance in normal valves and early postnatal dysregulation of HA homeostasis during disease may identify new mechanistic insight into AVD pathogenesis.",

We generated a zebrafish transgenic reporter line that reproduces faithfully the expression pattern of lama1, the gene encoding Laminin \u03b11, and we used this reporter line to investigate lama1 transcriptional regulation. Our findings established that lama1 expression is controlled by intronic enhancers, including an enhancer directing expression in the paraxial mesoderm, anterior spinal cord and hindbrain, located in intron 1. We show that Hedgehog signalling is necessary and sufficient for lama1 transcription in the paraxial mesoderm and identify putative Gli/Zic binding sites that may mediate this control.

Obesity is regarded a risk factor in OA, yet little is known about the interaction between adipose tissue-derived factors, the adipokines, and bone formation, although adipokines are associated with the pathogenesis of OA. Therefore, the effect of adipokines on bone and cartilage forming cells and osteophyte development was analyzed.Human OA osteophytes were histologically characterized and adipokine expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Osteoblasts and chondrocytes were isolated from OA tissue and stimulated with adiponectin, resistin, or visfatin. Cytokine and osteoblast/chondrocyte markers were quantified and activation of Wnt and p38 MAPK signaling was analyzed.Adiponectin, resistin, and visfatin were expressed in OA osteophytes by various articular cell types. Stimulation of OA osteoblasts with adiponectin and of OA chondrocytes with visfatin led to an increased release of proinflammatory mediators but not to osteoblast differentiation or activation. Additionally, visfatin increased matrix degrading factors in chondrocytes. Wnt signaling was not altered by adipokines, but adiponectin induced p38 MAPK signaling in osteoblasts.Adipokines are present in OA osteophytes, and adiponectin and visfatin increase the release of proinflammatory mediators by osteoblasts and chondrocytes. The effects of adiponectin were mediated by p38 MAPK but not Wnt signaling in osteoblasts. Therefore, the results support the idea that adipokines do not directly influence osteophyte development but the proinflammatory conditions in OA.",

These molecules are located primarily on the cell surface and in the pericellular matrix, where they interact with a multitude of macromolecules, including many growth factors. Manipulation of the enzymes involved in biosynthesis and modification of HSPG structures alters the properties of stem cells. Here, we focus on the involvement of heparanase (HPSE), the sole endo-glucuronidase capable of cleaving of HS, in differentiation of embryonic stem cells into the cells of the neural lineage. Embryonic stem (ES) cells overexpressing HPSE (Hpse-Tg) proliferated more rapidly than WT ES cells in culture and formed larger teratomas in vivo. In addition, differentiating Hpse-Tg ES cells also had a higher growth rate, and overexpression of HPSE in NSPCs enhanced Erk and Akt phosphorylation. Employing a two-step, monolayer differentiation, we observed an increase in HPSE as wild-type (WT) ES cells differentiated into neural stem and progenitor cells followed by down-regulation of HPSE as these NSPCs differentiated into mature cells of the neural lineage. Furthermore, NSPCs overexpressing HPSE gave rise to more oligodendrocytes than WT cultures, with a concomitant reduction in the number of neurons. Our present findings emphasize the importance of HS, in neural differentiation and suggest that by regulating the availability of growth factors and, or other macromolecules, HPSE promotes differentiation into oligodendrocytes.",

     "abstract": "Our previous studies of Antxr1 knockout mice suggested that fibrotic skin abnormalities in these mice are associated with increased VEGF signaling. Here, based on studies of primary fibroblasts isolated from skin of Antx1\u00a0+/+ and Antxr1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice at embryonic stage E17.5 and postnatal day P49, we conclude that increased Col1a1 and Fn1 expression in Antxr1-deficient fibroblasts is partly mediated by a cell-autonomous ANTXR1-dependent mechanism. In turn, this may act in parallel with VEGF-dependent regulation of collagen type I and fibronectin production. We demonstrate that shRNA mediated knockdown of VEGF in Antxr1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts reduces Col1a1 and Fn1 expression to below control levels, and these are restored by exogenous addition of recombinant VEGF. In addition, the increase in protein levels of collagen type I and fibronectin in mutant cells is blocked by VEGF neutralizing antibody. However, expressing the longest isoform of ANTXR1 (sv1) in mutant fibroblasts decreases levels of Ctgf, Col1a1 and Fn1 transcripts, but has no effect on VEGF expression. Taken together, our data suggest that the increased matrix production in Antxr1- deficient fibroblasts primarily occurs via a CTGF-dependent pathway and that other ANTXR1\u2013associated mechanisms contribute to VEGF-dependent increase of collagen type I and fibronectin expression. Our findings provide a basis for further studies of novel ANTXR1-dependent connective tissue homeostatic control mechanisms in healthy individuals, patients with organ fibrosis, and patients with GAPO syndrome.",

Furthermore, ligation by transglutaminase factor XIII (cross-linking) adds to the complexity of the fibrin network.

     "abstract": "Fibrinogen and its functional aspects have been linked to cardiovascular disease. There is vast discrepancy between the heritability of fibrinogen concentrations observed in twin studies and the heritability uncovered by genome wide association studies. We postulate that some of the missing heritability might be explained by the pleiotropic and polygenic co-regulation of fibrinogen through multiple targeted genes, apart from the fibrinogen genes themselves. To this end we investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes coding for phenotypes associated with total and \u03b3\u2032 fibrinogen concentrations and clot properties. Their individual and accumulative associations with the fibrinogen variables were explored together with possible co-regulatory processes as a result of the gain and loss of transcription factor binding sites (TFBS). Seventy-eight SNPs spanning the APOB, APOE, CBS, CRP, F13A1, FGA, FGB, FGG, LDL-R, MTHFR, MTR, PCSK-9 and SERPINE-1 genes were included in the final analysis. A novel PCSK-9 SNP (rs369066144) was identified in this population, which associated significantly (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) with clot lysis time (CLT). Apart from SNPs in the fibrinogen (FGA, FGB and FGG) and FXIII (F13A1) genes, the fibrinogen phenotypes were also associated with SNPs in genes playing a role in lipid homeostasis (LDL-R, PCSK-9) together with CBS and CRP polymorphisms (particularly, CRP-rs3093068). The genetic risk scores, presenting accumulative genetic risk, were significantly associated (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.007) with total and \u03b3\u2032 fibrinogen concentrations, lag time, slope and CLT, highlighting the importance of a polygenetic approach in determining complex phenotypes. SNPs significantly associated with the fibrinogen phenotypes, resulted in a total of 75 TFBS changes, of which 35 resulted in a loss and 40 in a gain of TFBS. In terms of co-regulation, V$IRF4.02, V$E2FF and V$HIFF were of particular importance. The investigation into TFBS provided valuable insight as to how sequence divergences in seemingly unrelated genes can result in transcriptional co-regulation of the fibrinogen phenotypes. The observed associations between the identified SNPs and the fibrinogen phenotypes therefore do not imply direct effects on cardiovascular disease outcomes, but may prove useful in explaining more of the genetic regulation of the investigated fibrinogen phenotypes.",

One of the unique features of fibronectin is its ability to specifically bind a large number of molecules including other components of the extracellular matrix, signaling molecules, and cell adhesion molecules. Cellular interactions with fibronectin lead to bidirectional crosstalk that directs cell function and also leads to cell-dependent changes in the extracellular matrix. Interestingly, fibronectin exists in a functional form composed of fibers that are nm to \u03bcm in diameter that is highly interwoven, and fibronectin molecules that constitute this material have a labile molecular conformation that can be altered through binding of allosteric partners and strain resulting from application of cell contractile forces.

Two major ECM components, fibronectin (Fn) and collagen I (Col I), are known to interact with each other to regulate cellular behavior. In this study, we seek to understand how Fn and Col I interplay and promote a dysregulated signaling pathway to facilitate tumor progression. Specifically, we investigated the evolution of tumor-conditioned stromal ECM composition, structure, and relaxation. Furthermore, we assessed how evolving Fn-Col I interactions gradually affected pro-angiogenic signaling. Our data first indicate that CAFs initially assembled a strained, viscous, and unfolded Fn matrix. This early altered Fn matrix was later remodeled into a thick Col I-rich matrix that was characteristic of a dense tumor mass. Next, our results suggest that this ECM remodeling was primarily mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This MMP activity caused profound structural and mechanical changes in the developing ECM, which then modified vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by CAFs and matrix sequestration. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which Fn and Col I synergistically interplay in promoting a sustained altered signaling cascade to remodel the breast tumor stroma for invasive breast tumor growth.",

However, direct delivery of satellite cells presents a challenge at a translational level due to inflammation and donor cell death, motivating the need to develop engineered matrices for muscle satellite cell delivery. This review will highlight important aspects of satellite cell and their niche biology in the context of muscle regeneration, and examine recent progresses in the development of engineered cell delivery matrices designed for skeletal muscle regeneration.

     "abstract": "Fibrin is a protein polymer that is essential for hemostasis and thrombosis, wound healing, and several other biological functions and pathological conditions that involve extracellular matrix. In addition to molecular and cellular interactions, fibrin mechanics has been recently shown to underlie clot behavior in the highly dynamic intra- and extravascular environments. Fibrin has both elastic and viscous properties. Perhaps the most remarkable rheological feature of the fibrin network is an extremely high elasticity and stability despite very low protein content. Another important mechanical property that is common to many filamentous protein polymers but not other polymers is stiffening occurring in response to shear, tension, or compression. New data has begun to provide a structural basis for the unique mechanical behavior of fibrin that originates from its complex multi-scale hierarchical structure. The mechanical behavior of the whole fibrin gel is governed largely by the properties of single fibers and their ensembles, including changes in fiber orientation, stretching, bending, and buckling. The properties of individual fibrin fibers are determined by the number and packing arrangements of double-stranded half-staggered protofibrils, which still remain poorly understood. It has also been proposed that forced unfolding of sub-molecular structures, including elongation of flexible and relatively unstructured portions of fibrin molecules, can contribute to fibrin deformations. In spite of a great increase in our knowledge of the structural mechanics of fibrin, much about the mechanisms of fibrin's biological functions remains unknown. Fibrin deformability is not only an essential part of the biomechanics of hemostasis and thrombosis, but also a rapidly developing field of bioengineering that uses fibrin as a versatile biomaterial with exceptional and tunable biochemical and mechanical properties.",

     "abstract": "Fibrin and collagen as well as their combinations play an important biological role in tissue regeneration and are widely employed in surgery as fleeces or sealants and in bioengineering as tissue scaffolds. Earlier studies demonstrated that fibrin-collagen composite networks displayed improved tensile mechanical properties compared to the isolated protein matrices. Unlike previous studies, here unconfined compression was applied to a fibrin-collagen filamentous polymer composite matrix to study its structural and mechanical responses to compressive deformation. Combining collagen with fibrin resulted in formation of a composite hydrogel exhibiting synergistic mechanical properties compared to the isolated fibrin and collagen matrices. Specifically, the composite matrix revealed a one order of magnitude increase in the shear storage modulus at compressive strains\u00a0>\u00a00.8 in response to compression compared to the mechanical features of individual components. These material enhancements were attributed to the observed structural alterations, such as network density changes, an increase in connectivity along with criss-crossing, and bundling of fibers. In addition, the compressed composite collagen/fibrin networks revealed a non-linear transformation of their viscoelastic properties with softening and stiffening regimes. These transitions were shown to depend on protein concentrations. Namely, a decrease in protein content drastically affected the mechanical response of the networks to compression by shifting the onset of stiffening to higher degrees of compression. Since both natural and artificially composed extracellular matrices experience compression in various (patho)physiological conditions, our results provide new insights into the structural biomechanics of the polymeric composite matrix that can help to create fibrin-collagen sealants, sponges, and tissue scaffolds with tunable and predictable mechanical properties.",

Here we investigate the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibronectin (FN) in this process.

Results show that soluble FN, FN fibrils, or increased contractile forces are insufficient to independently induce EMT. We further demonstrate that inhibition of latent TGF-\u03b21 binding to FN fibrils via either a monoclonal blocking antibody against the growth factor binding domain of FN or through use of a FN deletion mutant that lacks the growth factor binding domains of FN blocks EMT progression, indicating a novel role for FN in EMT in which the assembly of FN fibrils serves to localize TGF-\u03b21 signaling to drive EMT.",

Providing guidance cues and soluble factors to promote neurite outgrowth and cell survival can enhance repair. The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in tissue repair by controlling cell adhesion, motility, and growth. In this study, we explored the ability of a mesenchymal ECM to support neurite outgrowth from neurons in the superior cervical ganglia (SCG). Length and morphology of neurites extended on a decellularized fibroblast ECM were compared to those on substrates coated with laminin, a major ECM protein in neural tissue, or fibronectin, the main component of a mesenchymal ECM. Average radial neurite extension was equivalent on laminin and on the decellularized ECM, but contrasted with the shorter, curved neurites observed on the fibronectin substrate. Differences between neurites on fibronectin and on other substrates were confirmed by fast Fourier transform analyses. To control the direction of neurite outgrowth, we developed an ECM with linearly aligned fibril organization by orienting the fibroblasts that deposit the matrix on a polymeric surface micropatterned with a striped chemical interface. Neurites projected from SCGs appeared to reorient in the direction of the pattern. These results highlight the ability of a mesenchymal ECM to enhance neurite extension and to control the directional outgrowth of neurites. This micropatterned decellularized ECM architecture has potential as a regenerative microenvironment for nerve repair.",

Here, we used microfabricated, type I collagen-based 3-D tissue culture platforms to investigate the effect of breast cancer cell-derived TEVs on ASCs myofibroblast differentiation and consequential changes in extracellular matrix remodeling and vascular sprouting. TEVs collected from MDA MB-231 human metastatic breast cancer cells (MDAs) promoted ASC myofibroblast differentiation in both 2-D and 3-D cultures as indicated by increased alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and fibronectin (Fn) levels. Correspondingly, TEV-treated ASCs were more contractile, secreted more vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and promoted angiogenic sprouting of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). These changes were dependent on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2)-related signaling and tumor cell glutaminase activity as their inhibition decreased TEV-related myofibroblastic differentiation of ASCs and related functional consequences. In summary, our data suggest that TEVs are important signaling factors that contribute to ASC desmoplastic reprogramming in the tumor microenvironment, and suggest that tumor cell glutamine metabolism may be used as a therapeutic target to interfere with this process.",

Therefore, increasing transplant sensitivity to injury-induced SDF-1\u03b1 represents a method for increasing neural transplant efficacy. Previously, we have reported on a hyaluronic acid-laminin based hydrogel (HA-Lm gel) that increases NPSC expression of SDF-1\u03b1 receptor, CXCR4, and subsequently, NPSC chemotactic migration towards a source of SDF-1\u03b1 in vitro.

MMP14, a known regulator of angiogenesis, cleaved CCN5 and abrogated the angiostatic activity. CCN3 was also processed in the variable region by MMP14 and MMP2, and by MMP1, 8 and 9. In addition to the previously reported cleavages of CCN1 and CCN2 by several MMPs we found that MMPs 8, 9, and 1 process CCN1, and MMP8 and MMP9 also process CCN2. Thus, our study reveals additional and pervasive family-wide processing of CCN matricellular proteins/cytokines by MMPs. Furthermore, CCN5 cleavage by proangiogenic MMPs results in removal of an angiogenic brake held by CCN5.

AGEs contribute to the progression of fibrosis, in part by stimulating cellular pathways that affect gene expression. Long-lived ECM proteins are targets for non-enzymatic glycation but the question of whether the AGE-modified ECM leads to excess ECM accumulation and fibrosis remains unanswered. In this study, cellular changes due to AGE accretion in the ECM were investigated. Non-enzymatic glycation of proteins in a decellularized fibroblast ECM was achieved by incubating the ECM in a solution of methylglyoxal (MGO). Mass spectrometry of fibronectin (FN) isolated from the glycated matrix identified twenty-eight previously unidentified MGO-derived AGE modification sites including functional sites such as the RGD integrin-binding sequence. Mesangial cells grown on the glycated, decellularized matrix assembled increased amounts of FN matrix. Soluble AGE-modified bovine serum albumin (BSA) also stimulated FN matrix assembly and this effect was reduced by function-blocking antibodies against the receptor for AGE (RAGE). These results indicate that cells respond to AGEs by increasing matrix assembly and that RAGE is involved in this response. This raises the possibility that the accumulation of ECM during the progression of fibrosis may be enhanced by cell interactions with AGEs on a glycated ECM.",

In response to injury or disease SCs activate, proliferate and eventually differentiate and fuse to one another to form new muscle fibres, or to existing damaged fibres to repair them. The sulfated polysaccharide heparan sulfate (HS) is a highly variable biomolecule known to play key roles in the regulation of cell fate decisions, though the changes that muscle HS undergoes during SC differentiation are unknown. Here we show that the sulfation levels of HS increase during SC differentiation; more specifically, we observe an increase in 6-O and 2-O-sulfation in N-acetylated disaccharides. Interestingly, a specific increase in 6-O sulfation is also observed in the heparanome of ageing muscle, which we show leads to promotion of FGF2 signalling and satellite cell proliferation, suggesting a role for the heparanome dynamics in age-associated loss of quiescence. Addition of HS mimetics to differentiating SC cultures results in differential effects: an oversulfated HS mimetic increases differentiation and inhibits FGF2 signalling, a known major promoter of SC proliferation and inhibitor of differentiation. In contrast, FGF2 signalling is promoted by an N-acetylated HS mimetic, which inhibits differentiation and promotes SC expansion. We conclude that the heparanome of SCs is dynamically regulated during muscle differentiation and ageing, and that such changes might account for some of the phenotypes and signalling events that are associated with these processes.",

Replacement of R215 with glutamine restored binding. Substituting arginine at the equivalent locus (Q214) in integrins \u03b11 and \u03b12 I domains impaired their binding to GROGER. Collagen II, abundant in cartilage, lacks GROGER. GRSGET is uniquely expressed in the C-terminus of collagen II, but this motif is similarly not recognised by \u03b110\u03b21.

     "abstract": "Concurrent with a progressive loss of regenerative capacity, connective tissue aging is characterized by a progressive accumulation of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs). Besides being part of the typical aging process, type II diabetics are particularly affected by AGE accumulation due to abnormally high levels of systemic glucose that increases the glycation rate of long-lived proteins such as collagen. Although AGEs are associated with a wide range of clinical disorders, the mechanisms by which AGEs contribute to connective tissue disease in aging and diabetes are still poorly understood. The present study harnesses advanced multiscale imaging techniques to characterize a widely employed in vitro model of ribose induced collagen aging and further benchmarks these data against experiments on native human tissues from donors of different age. These efforts yield unprecedented insight into the mechanical changes in collagen tissues across hierarchical scales from molecular, to fiber, to tissue-levels. We observed a linear increase in molecular spacing (from 1.45\u00a0nm to 1.5\u00a0nm) and a decrease in the D-period length (from 67.5\u00a0nm to 67.1\u00a0nm) in aged tissues, both using the ribose model of in vitro glycation and in native human probes. Multiscale mechanical analysis of in vitro glycated tendons strongly suggests that AGEs reduce tissue viscoelasticity by severely limiting fiber\u2013fiber and fibril\u2013fibril sliding. This study lays an important foundation for interpreting the functional and biological effects of AGEs in collagen connective tissues, by exploiting experimental models of AGEs crosslinking and benchmarking them for the first time against endogenous AGEs in native tissue.",

     "abstract": "COL4A1 and COL4A2 are extracellular matrix proteins that form heterotrimers and are present in nearly all basement membranes in every organ. In the past decade, COL4A1 and COL4A2 mutations have been identified to cause a multi-system disorder for which penetrance and severity of constituent phenotypes can greatly vary. Here, we compare the outcomes of more than 100 mutations identified in patients and data from a murine allelic series to explore the presence of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations \u2013 many of which are shared among other types of collagen. We find that there is a frequency bias for COL4A1 over COL4A2 mutations and that glycine (Gly) substitutions within the triple helical domain are the most common class of mutations. Glycine is most often replaced by a charged amino acid, however the position of the mutation, and not the properties of the substituting amino acid, appears to have a greater influence on disease severity. Moreover, the impact of position is not straightforward. Observations from a murine allelic series suggest that mutations in the NC1 domain may result in relatively mild phenotypes via a \u2018quantitative\u2019 mechanism similar to other types of collagens, however, this effect was not apparent in human reports. Importantly, other position-dependent effects had differential impacts depending on the phenotype of interest. For example, the severity of cerebrovascular disease correlated with an amino-to-carboxy severity gradient for triple-helical glycine substitutions whereas the penetrance and severity of myopathy and nephropathy appear to involve a functional sub-domain(s). Greater understanding of genotype\u2013phenotype correlations and the interaction of consequences of different mutations will be important for patient prognosis and care and for developing mechanism-based therapeutics to treat individual components of this emerging syndrome.",

     "abstract": "Collagen XVIII is a ubiquitous basement membrane (BM) proteoglycan produced in three tissue-specific isoforms that differ in their N-terminal non-collagenous sequences, but share collagenous and C-terminal non-collagenous domains. The collagenous domain provides flexibility to the large collagen XVIII molecules on account of multiple interruptions in collagenous sequences. Each isoform has a complex multi-domain structure that endows it with an ability to perform various biological functions. The long isoform contains a frizzled-like (Fz) domain with Wnt-inhibiting activity and a unique domain of unknown function (DUF959), which is also present in the medium isoform. All three isoforms share an N-terminal laminin-G-like/thrombospondin-1 sequence whose specific functions still remain unconfirmed. The proteoglycan nature of the isoforms further increases the functional diversity of collagen XVIII. An anti-angiogenic domain termed endostatin resides in the C-terminus of collagen XVIII and is proteolytically cleaved from the parental molecule during the BM breakdown for example in the process of tumour progression. Recombinant endostatin can efficiently reduce tumour angiogenesis and growth in experimental models by inhibiting endothelial cell migration and proliferation or by inducing their death, but its efficacy against human cancers is still a subject of debate. Mutations in the COL18A1 gene result in Knobloch syndrome, a genetic disorder characterised mainly by severe eye defects and encephalocele and, occasionally, other symptoms. Studies with gene-modified mice have elucidated some aspects of this rare disease, highlighting in particular the importance of collagen XVIII in the development of the eye. Research with model organisms have also helped in determining other structural and biological functions of collagen XVIII, such as its requirement in the maintenance of BM integrity and its emerging roles in regulating cell survival, stem or progenitor cell maintenance and differentiation and inflammation. In this review, we summarise current knowledge on the properties and endogenous functions of collagen XVIII in normal situations and tissue dysregulation. When data is available, we discuss the functions of the distinct isoforms and their specific domains.",

Mutations in as many as 18 distinct genes expressed at the cutaneous basement membrane zone have been shown to be associated with the blistering phenotype, attesting to the role of the corresponding proteins in providing stable association of the epidermis to the dermis through adhesion at the dermo-epidermal basement membrane zone. Thus, different forms of EB have been highly instructive in providing information on the physiological functions of these proteins as integral components of the supramolecular adhesion complexes. In addition, precise information of the underlying genes and distinct mutations in families with EB has been helpful in subclassification of the disease with prognostic implications, as well as for prenatal testing and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. Furthermore, knowledge of the types of mutations is a prerequisite for application of allele-specific treatment approaches that have been recently developed, including read-through of premature termination codon mutations and chaperone-facilitated intracellular transport of conformationally altered proteins to proper physiologic subcellular location. Collectively, EB serves as a paradigm of heritable skin diseases in which significant progress has been made in identifying the underlying genetic bases and associated aberrant pathways leading from mutations to the phenotype, thus allowing application of precision medicine for this, currently intractable group of diseases.",

     "abstract": "Previous work has shown that myotubes cultured on laminin-coated substrates form complex aggregates of synaptic proteins that are similar in shape and composition to neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). Here we show that laminin instructs the location of complex aggregates which form only on the lower surface when laminin is coated onto culture dishes but over the entire cell when laminin is added in solution. Silencing of myotubes by agents that block electrical activity (tetrodotoxin, verapamil) or by inhibitors of calmodulin dependent kinase (CaMKII) render the myotube permissive for the formation of complex aggregates. Treatment with laminin alone will facilitate the formation of complex aggregates hours later when myotubes are made permissive by inhibiting CaMKII. The AChR agonist carbachol disperses pre formed aggregates suggesting that non-permissiveness may involve active dispersal of AChRs. The permissive period requires ongoing protein synthesis. The latter may reflect a requirement for rapsyn, which turns over rapidly, and is necessary for aggregation. Consistent with this geldanamycin, an agent that increases rapsyn turnover disrupts complex aggregates. Agrin is well known to induce small clusters of AChRs but does not induce complex aggregates even though aggregate formation requires MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase activated by agrin. Dystroglycan (DG) is the major laminin receptor mediating complex aggregate formation with some contribution from \u03b21 integrins. In addition, there is a pool of CaMKII associated with DG. We discuss how these permissive and instructive mechanisms bear on NMJ formation in vivo.",

In consequence, complete and permanent engraftment of cells does not necessarily have to occur to achieve substantial causal therapeutic effects. For these disorders cells can be used as transient vehicles for protein replacement. In addition, it is becoming evident that BM-linked genetic disorders are modified by secondary diseases mechanisms. Cell-based therapies have also the ability to target such disease modifying mechanisms. Thus, cell therapies can simultaneously provide causal treatment and symptomatic relief, and accordingly hold great potential for treatment of BM-linked disorders. However, this potential has for most applications and diseases so far not been realized. Here, we will present the state of cell therapies for BM-linked diseases.

     "abstract": "Type XIX collagen is a minor collagen that is associated with the basement membrane zone that belongs to the FACIT family (Fibril-Associated Collagens with Interrupted Triple helices). The FACIT family is composed of type IX, XII, XIV, XVI, XX, XXI, XXII and XIX collagens, which share many highly conserved structural motifs: a short NC1 domain, a thrombospondin-like N-terminal domain (TSPN), and numerous cysteine residues. The main role of FACITs is to ensure the integrity and stability of the extracellular matrix and its fibrillar collagen network by regulating the formation and size of the collagen fibrils.Type XIX collagen was discovered in a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. The collagen \u03b11(XIX) chain is composed of 5 triple-helical domains (COL) interrupted by 6 non-triple-helical (NC) domains with a short, C-terminal, 19 amino acid non-collagenous domain (NC1). This collagen is involved in the differentiation of muscle cells, central nervous system development, and formation of the esophagus.Type XIX collagen is associated with the basement membrane zone, like type XVIII and XV collagens. Its short NC1(XIX) C-terminal domain inhibits the migration and invasion of melanoma cells. It also exerts a strong anti-angiogenic effect by inhibiting MMP-14 and VEGF expression. NC1(XIX) binding to \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin decreases the phosphorylation of proteins involved in the FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase)/PI3K (PhosphoInositide 3-Kinase)/Akt (protein kinase B)/mTOR (Mammalian Target Of Rapamycin) pathway. On the other hand, NC1(XIX) induces an increase in GSK3\u03b2 activity by decreasing its level of phosphorylation. The inhibition of this pathway could explain the anti-tumor properties of the NC1(XIX) domain.",

In this review, we highlight recent findings that illustrate unifying molecular mechanisms whereby these physical cues contribute to tissue fibrosis and malignancy in three epithelial organs: breast, pancreas, and liver.

The polymerisation of laminins at the cell surface is mediated by the three short arms of the cross-shaped laminin heterotrimer. The short arms contain repeats of laminin-type epidermal growth factor-like (LE) domains, interspersed with globular domains of unknown function. A single LF domain is inserted between LE5 and LE6 of the laminin \u03b21 and \u03b22 chains. We report the crystal structure at 1.85\u00a0\u00c5 resolution of the laminin \u03b22 LE5-LF-LE6 region. The LF domain consists of a \u03b2-sandwich related to bacterial family 35 carbohydrate binding modules, and more distantly to the L4 domains present in the short arms of laminin \u03b1 and \u03b3 chains. An \u03b1-helical region mediates the extensive interaction of the LF domain with LE5. The relative arrangement of LE5 and LE6 is very similar to that of consecutive LE domains in uninterrupted LE tandems. Fitting atomic models to a low-resolution structure of the first eight domains of the laminin \u03b21 chain determined by small-angle X-ray scattering suggests a deviation from the regular LE array at the LE4\u2013LE5 junction.

In this capacity, integrins cooperate with different cell surface receptors, including growth factor receptors and G-protein coupled receptors, to regulate intracellular signaling pathways that control cell polarization, spreading, migration, survival, and gene expression. A distinct subfamily of molecules in the integrin family of adhesion receptors is formed by receptors that mediate cell adhesion to laminins, major components of the basement membrane that lie under clusters of cells or surround them, separating them from other cells and/or adjacent connective tissue. During the past decades, many studies have provided evidence for a role of laminin-binding integrins in tumorigenesis, and both tumor-promoting and suppressive activities have been identified. In this review we discuss the dual role of the laminin-binding integrins \u03b13\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24 in tumor development and progression, and examine the factors and mechanisms involved in these opposing effects.",

Integrins, transmembrane receptors formed by non-covalently bound \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits, serve as laminin receptors, but their role in development and homeostasis of the kidney collecting system is poorly defined. Integrin \u03b13\u03b21, one of the major laminin receptors, plays a minor role in kidney collecting system development, while the role of \u03b16 containing integrins (\u03b16\u03b21 and \u03b16\u03b24), the other major laminin receptors, is unknown. Patients with mutations in \u03b16 containing integrins not only develop epidermolysis bullosa, but also have abnormalities in the kidney collecting system. In this study, we show that selectively deleting the \u03b16 or \u03b24 integrin subunits at the initiation of ureteric bud development in mice does not affect morphogenesis. However, the collecting system becomes dilated and dysmorphic as the mice age. The collecting system in both null genotypes was also highly susceptible to unilateral ureteric obstruction injury with evidence of excessive tubule dilatation and epithelial cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, integrin \u03b16-null collecting duct cells are unable to withstand high mechanical force when adhered to laminin. Thus, we conclude that \u03b16 integrins are important for maintaining the integrity of the kidney collecting system by enhancing tight adhesion of the epithelial cells to the basement membrane.

DDR1 expression increases following kidney injury and accumulating evidence suggests that it contributes to the progression of injury. To this end, deletion of DDR1 is beneficial in ameliorating kidney injury induced by angiotensin infusion, unilateral ureteral obstruction, or nephrotoxic nephritis. Most of the beneficial effects observed in the DDR1-null mice are attributed to reduced inflammatory cell infiltration to the site of injury, suggesting that DDR1 plays a pro-inflammatory effect. The goal of this study was to determine whether, in addition to its pro-inflammatory effect, DDR1 plays a deleterious effect in kidney injury by directly regulating extracellular matrix production. We show that DDR1-null mice have reduced deposition of glomerular collagens I and IV as well as decreased proteinuria following the partial renal ablation model of kidney injury. Using mesangial cells isolated from DDR1-null mice, we show that these cells produce significantly less collagen compared to DDR1-null cells reconstituted with wild type DDR1. Moreover, mutagenesis analysis revealed that mutations in the collagen binding site or in the kinase domain significantly reduce DDR1-mediated collagen production. Finally, we provide evidence that blocking DDR1 kinase activity with an ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor reduces collagen production. In conclusion, our studies indicate that the kinase activity of DDR1 plays a key role in DDR1-induced collagen synthesis and suggest that blocking collagen-mediated DDR1 activation may be beneficial in fibrotic diseases.",

The influence of laminin-111 (Lm111) and its integrin and dystroglycan (DG) receptors on epiblast in embryoid bodies (EBs), a model for differentiation of the embryonic plate, was further investigated. Lm111 added to the medium of EBs initiated conversion of inner nonpolar cell to the polarized epiblast epithelium with an exterior-to-central basal-to-apical orientation. Microinjection of Lm111 into EB interiors resulted in an interior BM with complete inversion of cell polarity. Lm111 assembled a BM on integrin-\u03b21 null EBs with induction of polarization at reduced efficiency. \u03b2-Integrin compensation was not detected in these nulls with integrin adaptor proteins failing to assemble. A dimer of laminin LG domains 4\u20135 (LZE3) engineered to strongly bind to \u03b1-dystroglycan almost completely inhibited laminin accumulation on integrin \u03b21-null EBs, reducing BM and ablating cell polarization. When Lm111 was incubated with integrin-\u03b21/dystroglycan double-knockout EBs, laminin failed to accumulate on the EBs, the EBs did not differentiate, and the EBs underwent apoptosis. Collectively the findings support the hypotheses that the locus of laminin cell surface assembly can determine the axis of epithelial polarity. This requires integrin- and/or dystroglycan-dependent binding to laminin LG domains with the highest efficiency achieved when both receptors are present. Finally, EBs that cannot assemble a matrix undergo apoptosis.",

Heparan sulfate proteoglycans such as agrin are major components of the GBM, along with \u03b1345(IV) collagen, laminin-521 and nidogen. A loss of GBM heparan sulfate chains is associated with proteinuria in several glomerular diseases and may contribute to the underlying pathology. As the major determinants of the anionic charge of the GBM, heparan sulfate chains have been thought to impart charge selectivity to the glomerular filtration, a view challenged by the negligible albuminuria in mice that lack heparan sulfate in the GBM. Recent studies provide increasing evidence that heparan sulfate chains modulate local complement activation by recruiting complement regulatory protein factor H, the major inhibitor of the alternative pathway in plasma. Factor H selectively inactivates C3b bound to surfaces bearing host-specific polyanions such as heparan sulfate, thus limiting complement activation on self surfaces such as the GBM, which are not protected by cell-bound complement regulators. We discuss mechanisms whereby the acquired loss of GBM heparan sulfate can impair the local regulation of the alternative pathway, exacerbating complement activation and glomerular injury in immune-mediated kidney diseases such as membranous nephropathy and lupus nephritis.",

A unifying theme during organogenesis is the importance of epithelial cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and growth factors (GFs). The diverse developmental mechanisms giving rise to these epithelial organs involve many organ-specific GFs, but a unifying paradigm during organogenesis is the regulation of GF activity by heparan sulfates (HS) on the cell surface and in the ECM. This primarily involves the interactions of GFs with the sulfated side-chains of HS proteoglycans. HS is one of the most diverse biopolymers and modulates GF binding and signaling at the cell surface and in the ECM of all tissues. Here, we review what is known about how HS regulates branching morphogenesis of epithelial organs with emphasis on the developing salivary gland, which is a classic model to investigate epithelial-ECM interactions. We also address the structure, biosynthesis, turnover and function of HS during organogenesis. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms that control HS dynamics may aid in the development of therapeutic interventions for diseases and novel strategies for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

One innovative approach to overcome these limitations has focused on incorporating bioactivity into cytocompatible, synthetic hydrogels that present tunable physicochemical properties. This review provides an overview of successful approaches to convey basement membrane-like bioactivity into 3D artificial hydrogel matrices in order to recapitulate cellular responses to native matrices. Recent advances involving biofunctionalization of synthetic hydrogels via incorporation of bioactive motifs that promote cell-matrix interactions and cell-directed matrix degradation will be discussed.

Multiple studies, including ours, have demonstrated the possibility of using the extracellular matrix (ECM) of animal organs as platform for tissue engineering and more recently, discarded human organs have also been proposed as scaffold source. In contrast to artificial biomaterials, natural ECM has the advantage of undergoing continuous remodeling which allows adaptation to diverse conditions. It is known that natural matrices present diverse immune properties when compared to artificial biomaterials. However, how these properties compare between diseased and healthy ECM and artificial scaffolds has not yet been defined.To answer this question, we used decellularized renal ECM derived from WT mice and from mice affected by Alport Syndrome at different time-points of disease progression as a model of renal failure with extensive fibrosis. We characterized the morphology and composition of these ECMs and compared their in vitro effects on macrophage activation with that of synthetic scaffolds commonly used in the clinic (collagen type I and poly-L-(lactic) acid, PLLA).We showed that ECM derived from Alport kidneys differed in fibrous protein deposition and cytokine content when compared to ECM derived from WT kidneys. Yet, both WT and Alport renal ECM induced macrophage differentiation mainly towards a reparative (M2) phenotype, while artificial biomaterials towards an inflammatory (M1) phenotype. Anti-inflammatory properties of natural ECMs were lost when homogenized, hence three-dimensional structure of ECM seems crucial for generating an anti-inflammatory response. Together, these data support the notion that natural ECM, even if derived from diseased kidneys promote a M2 protolerogenic macrophage polarization, thus providing novel insights on the applicability of ECM obtained from discarded organs as ideal scaffold for tissue engineering.",

Two additional proteins, peroxidasin and Goodpasture antigen-binding protein (GPBP), have recently emerged as potential members of the toolkit. In the present study, we sought to determine whether peroxidasin and GPBP undergo dynamic regulation in the assembly of uterine tissue BMs in early pregnancy as a tractable model for dynamic adult BMs. We explored these proteins in the context of collagen IV and laminin that are known to extensively change for decidualization. Electron microscopic analyses revealed: 1) a smooth continuous layer of BM in between the epithelial and stromal layers of the preimplantation endometrium; and 2) interrupted, uneven, and progressively thickened BM within the pericellular space of the postimplantation decidua. Quantification of mRNA levels by qPCR showed changes in expression levels that were complemented by immunofluorescence localization of peroxidasin, GPBP, collagen IV, and laminin. Novel BM-associated and subcellular spatiotemporal localization patterns of the four components suggest both collective pericellular functions and distinct functions in the uterus during reprogramming for embryo implantation.",

For example, the function of bone depends on its rigidity, and the function of skin depends on its elasticity. The aggregate physical properties of tissues are determined by a collaborative relationship between their cells and matrix and are the product of genetic programs, circulating chemical signals, physical signals, and age. The mechanical properties of matrix and basement membranes in biologic systems are difficult to understand in detail because of their complexity and technical limitations of measurements. Matrix may contain fibrillary collagens, network collagens, other fibrillar proteins such as elastin, fibronectin, and laminins, proteoglycans, and can be a reservoir for growth factors. In each tissue and in different regions of the same tissue, matrix composition can vary. The goal of measuring the mechanical properties of matrix is to understand the physical environment experienced by specific cell types to be able to control cell behavior in vivo and for tissue engineering. At this time, such precise analysis is not possible. The general elastic properties of tissues are now better characterized, and model systems using limited numbers of matrix constituents permit improved understanding of the physical behavior of matrix and its effects on cells.

     "abstract": "Estrogen receptors have pivotal roles in breast cancer growth and progression. ER\u03b1 has been clearly shown to play key role in hormone-dependent breast cancer properties, but little is known for the isoform ER\u03b2. To evaluate the role of ER\u03b2, we established stably transfected ER\u03b2-suppressed MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by knocking down the human ER\u03b2 gene, using specific shRNA lentiviral particles. As observed by scanning electron microscopy, the ER\u03b2 suppression induces significant phenotypic changes in these cells, as compared to the control cells. Notably, the down-regulation of ER\u03b2 decreases the expression of the mesenchymal markers fibronectin and vimentin, whereas it increases the expression levels of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and cell junctions. These alterations are followed by reduced levels of the functional cell properties that promote the aggressiveness of these cells, such as proliferation, migration, spreading capacity, invasion and adhesion on collagen I. Notably, the down-regulation of ER\u03b2 reduces the migration of breast cancer cells through the tyrosine kinase receptors EGFR/IGF-IR and the JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Moreover, ER\u03b2 has a crucial role on the gene expression of several matrix mediators, including the proteoglycans syndecans-2/-4 and serglycin, several matrix metalloproteinases, plasminogen activation system components and receptor tyrosine kinases. These data clearly show that ER\u03b2 plays a crucial role in the cell behavior and ECM composition of the highly aggressive MDA-MB-231 cells and opens a new area of research to further understand its role and to improve pharmaceutical targeting of the non-hormone dependent breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Laminin \u03b15 is broadly expressed in the epidermal basement membrane (BM) of mature mice and its elimination at this site (Lama5Ker5 mouse) results in hyperproliferation of basal keratinocytes and a delay in hair follicle development, which correlated with upregulation of the dermally-derived laminin \u03b12 and laminin \u03b14 chains in the epidermal BM and of tenascin-C subjacent to the BM. In vitro studies revealed laminin 511 to be strongly adhesive for primary keratinocytes and that loss of laminin \u03b15 does not result in cell autonomous defects in proliferation. Flow cytometry reveals that the loss of laminin \u03b15 resulted in increased numbers of CD45+, CD4+ and CD11b+ immune cells in the skin, which temporo-spatial analyses revealed were detectable only subsequent to the loss of laminin \u03b15 and the appearance of the hyperproliferative keratinocyte phenotype. These findings indicate that immune cell changes are the consequence and not the cause of keratinocyte hyperproliferation. Loss of laminin \u03b15 in the epidermal BM was also associated with changes in the expression of several dermally-derived growth factors involved in keratinocyte proliferation and hair follicle development in adult but not new born Lama5Ker5 skin, including KGF, EGF and KGF-2. In situ binding of FGF-receptor-2\u03b1 (IIIb)-Fc chimera (FGFR2IIIb) to mouse skin sections revealed decoration of several BMs, including the epidermal BM, which was absent in Lama5Ker5 skin. This indicates reduced levels of FGFR2IIIb ligands, which include KGF and KGF-2, in the epidermal BM of adult Lama5Ker5 skin. Our data suggest an initial inhibitory effect of laminin \u03b15 on basal keratinocyte proliferation and migration, which is exacerbated by subsequent changes in growth factor expression by epidermal and dermal cells, implicating laminin \u03b15 in epidermal\u2013dermal intercommunication.",

     "abstract": "Laminins are the most abundant non-collagenous basement membrane (BM) components, composed of an \u03b1, \u03b2 and \u03b3 chain. The laminin \u03b31 chain, encoded by LAMC1, is the most abundant \u03b3 chain. The main laminin isoforms in the dermo-epidermal junction (DEJ) are laminin-332, laminin-511 and laminin-211, the latter being restricted to the lower part of hair follicles (HFs). Complete deletion of LAMC1 results in lethality around embryonic day 5.5. To study the function of laminin \u03b31 containing isoforms in skin development and maturation after birth, we generated mice lacking LAMC1 expression in basal keratinocytes (LAMC1EKO) using the keratin 14 (K14) Cre/loxP system. This deletion resulted in loss of keratinocyte derived laminin-511 and in deposition of fibroblast derived laminin-211 throughout the whole DEJ. The DEJ in areas between hemidesmosomes was thickened, whereas hemidesmosome morphology was normal. Most strikingly, LAMC1EKO mice showed delayed HF morphogenesis accompanied by reduced proliferation of hair matrix cells and impaired differentiation of hair shafts (HS). However, this deletion did not interfere with early HF development, since placode numbers and embryonic hair germ formation were not affected. Microarray analysis of skin revealed down regulation of mainly different hair keratins. This is due to reduced expression of transcription factors such as HoxC13, FoxN1, FoxQ1 and Msx2, known to regulate expression of hair keratins. While the role of laminin-511 in signaling during early hair germ formation and elongation phase has been described, we here demonstrate that epidermal laminin-511 is also a key regulator for later hair development and HS differentiation.",

The wide range of MMP-13 proteolytic capacity suggests that it is a powerful, potentially destructive proteinase and thus it has been believed that MMP-13 is not produced in most adult human tissues in the steady state. Present study has revealed that human chondrocytes isolated from healthy adults constitutively express and secrete MMP-13, but that it is rapidly endocytosed and degraded by chondrocytes. Both pro- and activated MMP-13 bind to clusters II and III of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1). Domain deletion studies indicated that the hemopexin domain is responsible for this interaction. Binding competition between MMP-13 and ADAMTS-4, -5 or TIMP-3, which also bind to cluster II, further shown that the MMP-13 binding site within cluster II is different from those of ADAMTS-4, -5 or TIMP-3. MMP-13 is therefore co-endocytosed with ADAMTS-5 and TIMP-3 by human chondrocytes. These findings indicate that MMP-13 may play a role on physiological turnover of cartilage extracellular matrix and that LRP1 is a key modulator of extracellular levels of MMP-13 and its internalization is independent of the levels of ADAMTS-4, -5 and TIMP-3.",

     "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) plays an essential role in cartilage where it functions to retain aggrecan. Previous studies have suggested that aggrecan is anchored indirectly to the plasma membrane of chondrocytes via its binding to cell-associated HA. However, reagents used to test these observations such as hyaluronidase and HA oligosaccharides are short term and may have side activities that complicate interpretation. Using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach, a model system was developed by generating HA-deficient chondrocyte cell lines. HA synthase-2 (Has2)-specific single guide RNA was introduced into two different variant lines of rat chondrosarcoma chondrocytes; knockout clones were isolated and characterized. Two other members of the HA synthase gene family were expressed at very low relative copy number but showed no compensatory response in the Has2 knockouts. Wild type chondrocytes of both variants exhibited large pericellular matrices or coats extending from the plasma membrane. Addition of purified aggrecan monomer expanded the size of these coats as the proteoglycan became retained within the pericellular matrix. Has2 knockout chondrocytes lost all capacity to assemble a particle-excluding pericellular matrix and more importantly, no matrices formed around the knockout cells following the addition of purified aggrecan. When grown as pellet cultures so as to generate a bioengineered neocartilage tissue, the Has2 knockout chondrocytes assumed a tightly-compacted morphology as compared to the wild type cells. When knockout chondrocytes were transduced with Adeno-ZsGreen1-mycHas2, the cell-associated pericellular matrices were restored including the capacity to bind and incorporate additional exogenous aggrecan into the matrix. These results suggest that HA is essential for aggrecan retention and maintaining cell separation during tissue formation.",

Fibronectin (FN) is a large glycoprotein abundantly expressed in breast cancer extracellular matrices (ECMs) postulated to be a marker of aggressiveness during cancer pathogenesis. In this study we demonstrate that IGF-I/EGF as well E2 strongly increase the adhesion of the MCF-7 breast cancer cells onto FN. Moreover, IGF-IR is necessary for the IGF-I-/EGF- and E2-induced cell adhesion. Erk1/2 inhibition abolished the IGF-I-/EGF-/E2-induced MCF-7 cell adhesion, suggesting that this regulation of cell adhesion is perpetrated through Erk1/2 downstream signaling. Erk1/2 signaling was shown to modulate IGF-IR status as its' inhibition attenuates both IGF-IR expression and activation. Notably, EGF and E2 enhanced the mRNA as well as protein expression of IGF-IR in MCF-7 cells. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that treatment of MCF-7 cells with IGF-I or EGF induced actin reorganization, which was attenuated with Erk1/2 inhibition. Interestingly, IGF-I treatment induced a co-localization of IGF-IR and FAK, which was evident mostly at the cell membranes of MCF-7 cells. In summary, IGF-IR was shown to be a convergence point for the IGF-/EGF- and E2-dependent MCF-7 cell adhesion onto FN.",

Early lethality of mice null for the BMP1 gene Bmp1 or the mTLL1 gene Tll1 has impaired in vivo studies of these proteinases. To overcome issues of early lethality and functional redundancy we developed the novel BTKO mouse strain, with floxed Bmp1 and Tll1 alleles, for induction of postnatal, simultaneous ablation of the two genes. We previously showed these mice to have a skeletal phenotype that includes elements of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), osteomalacia, and deficient osteocyte maturation, observations validated by the finding of BMP1 mutations in a subset of human patients with OI-like phenotypes. However, the roles of BMP1-like proteinase in non-skeletal tissues have yet to be explored, despite the supposed importance of putative substrates of these proteinases in such tissues. Here, we employ BTKO mice to investigate potential roles for these proteinases in skin. Loss of BMP1-like proteinase activity is shown to result in markedly thinned and fragile skin with unusually densely packed collagen fibrils and delayed wound healing. We demonstrate deficits in the processing of collagens I and III, decorin, biglycan, and laminin 332 in skin, which indicate mechanisms whereby BMP1-like proteinases affect the biology of this tissue. In contrast, lack of effects on collagen VII processing or deposition indicates this putative substrate to be biosynthetically processed by non-BMP1-like proteinases.",

     "abstract": "Fibulin-4 is a 60\u00a0kDa calcium binding glycoprotein that has an important role in development and integrity of extracellular matrices. It interacts with elastin, fibrillin-1 and collagen IV as well as with lysyl oxidases and is involved in elastogenesis and cross-link formation. To date, several mutations in the fibulin-4 gene (FBLN4/EFEMP2) are known in patients whose major symptoms are vascular deformities, aneurysm, cutis laxa, joint laxity, or arachnodactyly. The pathogenetic mechanisms how these mutations translate into the clinical phenotype are, however, poorly understood. In order to elucidate these mechanisms, we expressed fibulin-4 mutants recombinantly in HEK293 cells, purified the proteins in native forms and analyzed alterations in protein synthesis, secretion, matrix assembly, and interaction with other proteins in relation to wild type fibulin-4. Our studies show that different mutations affect these properties in multiple ways, resulting in fibulin-4 deficiency and/or impaired ability to form elastic fibers. The substitutions E126K and C267Y impaired secretion of the protein, but not mRNA synthesis. Furthermore, the E126K mutant showed less resistance to proteases, reduced binding to collagen IV and fibrillin-1, as well as to LTBP1s and LTBP4s. The A397T mutation introduced an extra O-glycosylation site and deleted binding to LTBP1s. We show that fibulin-4 binds stronger than fibulin-3 and -5 to LTBP1s, 3, and 4s, and to the lysyl oxidases LOX and LOXL1; the binding of fibulin-4 to the LOX propeptide was strongly reduced by the mutation E57K. These findings show that different mutations in the fibulin-4 gene result in different molecular defects affecting secretion rates, protein stability, LOX-induced cross-linking, or binding to other ECM components and molecules of the TGF-\u03b2 pathway, and thus illustrate the complex role of fibulin-4 in connective tissue assembly.",

     "abstract": "High heparanase expression is associated with enhanced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis in many types of cancer. However, the mechanisms driving high heparanase expression are not fully understood. In the present study, we discovered that drugs used in the treatment of myeloma upregulate heparanase expression. Frontline anti-myeloma drugs, bortezomib and carfilzomib activate the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway to trigger heparanase expression in tumor cells. Blocking the NF-\u03baB pathway diminished this chemotherapy-induced upregulation of heparanase expression. Activated NF-\u03baB signaling was also found to drive high heparanase expression in drug resistant myeloma cell lines. In addition to enhancing heparanase expression, chemotherapy also caused release of heparanase by tumor cells into the conditioned medium. This soluble heparanase was taken up by macrophages and triggered an increase in TNF-\u03b1 production. Heparanase is also taken up by tumor cells where it induced expression of HGF, VEGF and MMP-9 and activated ERK and Akt signaling pathways. These changes induced by heparanase are known to be associated with the promotion of an aggressive tumor phenotype. Importantly, the heparanase inhibitor Roneparstat diminished the uptake and the downstream effects of soluble heparanase. Together, these discoveries reveal a novel mechanism whereby chemotherapy upregulates heparanase, a known promoter of myeloma growth, and suggest that therapeutic targeting of heparanase during anti-cancer therapy may improve patient outcome.",

     "abstract": "Dysregulated repair of lung injury often results in lung fibrosis characterized by unremitting deposition of matrix components including glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan (HA). HA is mainly produced by hyaluronan synthases (HAS) in mesenchymal cells. We previously demonstrated that over-expression of HAS2 in mesenchymal cells in mice regulates the invasiveness of fibroblasts and promotes severe lung fibrosis. The mechanisms that control the resolution of lung fibrosis are unknown. We propose that a critical step in resolving fibrosis is the induction of senescence in fibrotic fibroblasts and hyaluronan synthase 2 may regulate this process. We found that fibrotic fibroblasts developed the characteristics of replicative senescence in culture and that HAS2 expression was dramatically down-regulated. Furthermore, down-regulation of HAS2 initiated and regulated fibroblast senescence through a p27-CDK2-SKP2 pathway. Deletion of HAS2 in mouse mesenchymal cells increased the cellular senescence of fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced mouse lung fibrosis in vivo. These data suggest that HAS2 may be a critical regulator of the fate of pulmonary fibrosis and we propose a model where over-expression of HAS2 promotes an invasive phenotype resulting in severe fibrosis and down-regulation of HAS2 promotes resolution. Targeting HAS2 to induce fibroblast senescence could be an attractive approach to resolve tissue fibrosis.",

     "abstract": "Twisted gastrulation (Tsg) and chordin are secreted glycoproteins that function together as BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) antagonists to regulate BMP growth factor signalling. Chordin binds to BMPs, preventing them from interacting with their receptors and Tsg is known to strengthen this inhibitory complex. Tsg also acts as a BMP agonist by promoting cleavage of chordin by tolloid-family proteinases. Here we explore the structural mechanism through which Tsg exerts this dual activity. We have characterized the nanoscale structure of human Tsg using in-solution biomolecular analysis and show that Tsg is a globular monomer with a flattened cross shape. Tsg has a high proportion of N-linked glycans, in relation to its molecular weight, which supports a role in solubilising BMPs. Tsg binds with high affinity to the C-terminal region of chordin and was also able to inhibit BMP-7 signalling directly but did not have an effect on BMP-4 signalling. Although both Tsg and mammalian tolloid are involved in chordin cleavage, no interaction could be detected between them using surface plasmon resonance. Together these data suggest that Tsg functions as a BMP-agonist by inducing conformational change in chordin making it more susceptible to tolloid cleavage and as a BMP-antagonist either independently or via a chordin-mediated mechanism. Following single cleavage of chordin by tolloids, Tsg continues to strengthen the inhibitory complex, supporting a role for partially cleaved chordin in BMP regulation.",

Mouse models of excess TGF\u03b2 signaling display increased adiposity and predisposition to type-2 diabetes. It is therefore interesting that individuals with Marfan syndrome, a disease in which fibrillin-1 mutation leads to aberrant TGF\u03b2 signaling, typically present with extreme fat hypoplasia. The goal of this project was to characterize multiple fibrillin-1 mutant mouse strains to understand how fibrillin-1 contributes to metabolic health. The results of this study demonstrate that fibrillin-1 contributes little to lipid storage and metabolic homeostasis, which is in contrast to the obesity and metabolic changes associated with MAGP1 deficiency. MAGP1 but not fibrillin-1 mutant mice had elevated TGF\u03b2 signaling in their adipose tissue, which is consistent with the difference in obesity phenotypes. However, fibrillin-1 mutant strains and MAGP1-deficient mice all exhibit increased bone length and reduced bone mineralization which are characteristic of Marfan syndrome. Our findings suggest that Marfan-associated adipocyte hypoplasia is likely not due to microfibril-associated changes in adipose tissue, and provide evidence that MAGP1 may function independently of fibrillin in some tissues.",

This may lead to the generation of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, important diagnostic markers in rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, the citrullination may directly affect protein function. Based on structural analysis, we found that most ECM-associated growth factors (GFs) have arginine residues in their receptor recognition sites. Thus, they are potential functional targets of extracellular citrullination. To examine this further, we focused on the citrullination of transforming growth factor-\u03b2s (TGF-\u03b2), well-known ECM-associated GFs. PAD-treatment of CHO-LTBP1 cell derived matrix, rich with TGF-\u03b2, decreased the level of TGF-\u03b2 activity as detected by HaCaT and MLEC-PAI-1/Lu reporter cells. Additional experiments indicated that PAD-treatment inhibits the integrin-mediated TGF-\u03b2 activation since PAD-treatment decreased the binding of integrin \u03b1V\u03b26 ectodomain as well as integrin-mediated spreading of MG-63 and HaCaT cells to \u03b21-latency associated peptide (TGF-\u03b21 LAP). The citrullination of the RGD site, an important integrin recognition motif, was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Furthermore, the citrullination of active TGF-\u03b21 inhibited its binding to recombinant TGF-\u03b2 receptor II, and prevented its ability to activate TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Thus, extracellular PAD activity can affect the function of ECM-associated growth factors by different mechanisms. Importantly, the citrullination of both latent and active TGF-\u03b2 has the potency to regulate the inflammatory process.",

Collagen VI is a microfibrillar collagen enriched in the pericellular matrix of tendon fibroblasts with a potential regulatory role in tendon repair mechanism. We investigated the molecular basis of the interaction between collagen VI and the cell membrane both in tissue sections and fibroblast cultures of human tendon, and analyzed the deposition of collagen VI during migration and myofibroblast trans-differentiation, two crucial events for tendon repair. Tendon fibroblast displayed a collagen VI microfibrillar network closely associated with the cell surface. Binding of collagen VI with the cell membrane was mediated by NG2 proteoglycan, as demonstrated by in vitro perturbation of collagen VI\u2013NG2 interaction with a NG2-blocking antibody.Cultures subjected to wound healing scratch assay displayed collagen VI\u2013NG2 complexes at the trailing edge of migrating cells, suggesting a potential role in cell migration. In fact, the addition of a NG2-blocking antibody led to an impairment of cell polarization and delay of wound closure. Similar results were obtained after in vitro perturbation of collagen VI extracellular assembly with the 3C4 anti-collagen VI antibody and in collagen VI-deficient tendon cultures of a Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy patient carrying mutations in COL6A2 gene.Moreover, in vitro treatment with transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21) induced a dramatic reduction of NG2 expression, both at protein and mRNA transcript level, and the impairment of collagen VI association with the cell membrane. Instead, collagen VI was still detectable in the extracellular matrix in association with ED-A fibronectin and collagen I, which were strongly induced by TGF\u03b21 treatment.Our findings reveal a critical role of the NG2 proteoglycan for the binding of collagen VI to the surface of tendon fibroblasts. By interacting with NG2 proteoglycan and other extracellular matrix proteins, collagen VI regulates fibroblasts behavior and the assembly of tendon matrix, thereby playing a crucial role in tendon repair.",

Identification of factors involved in the regulation of MSC proliferation, migration and differentiation could provide insights into the pathophysiological regulation of MSC and be exploited to optimize clinical grade expansion protocols for therapeutic use.Here we identify thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) as a major regulator of MSC. TSP-1 induced MSC proliferation. This effect was mediated by TSP-1-induced activation of endogenous TGF\u03b2, as shown by the inhibitory effects of anti-TGF\u03b2 antibodies and by the lack of activity of TSP-2 \u2014 that does not activate TGF\u03b2. Moreover, TSP-1 strongly potentiated the proliferative and migratory activity of PDGF on MSC. TSP-1 directly bound to PDGF, through a site located within the TSP-1 type III repeats, and protected the growth factor from degradation by MSC-derived proteases, hence increasing its stability and bioavailability.The studies presented here identify a more comprehensive picture of the pleiotropic effect of TSP-1 on MSC behavior, setting the basis for further studies aimed at investigating the possible use of PDGF and TSP-1 in the in vitro expansion of MSC for therapeutic applications.",

     "abstract": "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a genetic disease of Type I collagen and collagen-associated pathways that results in brittle bone behavior characterized by fracture and reduced mechanical properties. Based on previous work in our laboratory showing that raloxifene (RAL) can significantly improve bone mechanical properties through non-cellular mechanisms, we hypothesized that raloxifene would improve the mechanical properties of OI bone. In experiment 1, tibiae from female wild type (WT) and homozygous oim mice were subjected to in vitro soaking in RAL followed by mechanical tests. RAL soaking resulted in significantly higher post-yield displacement (+\u00a075% in WT, +\u00a0472% in oim; p\u00a0<\u00a00.004), with no effect on ultimate load or stiffness, in both WT and oim animals. In experiment 2, eight-week old WT and oim male mice were treated for eight weeks with saline vehicle (VEH) or RAL. Endpoint measures included assessment of in vivo skeletal fractures, bone density/geometry and mechanical properties. In vivo skeletal fractures of the femora, assessed by micro CT imaging, were significantly lower in oim-RAL (20%) compared to oim-VEH (48%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). RAL led to significantly higher DXA-based BMD (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and CT-based trabecular BV/TV in both WT and oim animals compared to those treated with VEH. Fracture toughness of the femora was lower in oim mice compared to WT and improved with RAL in both genotypes. These results suggest that raloxifene reduces the incidence of fracture in this mouse model of oim. Furthermore, they suggest that raloxifene's effects may be the result of both cellular (increased bone mass) and non-cellular (presumably changes in hydration) mechanisms, raising the possibility of using raloxifene, or related compounds, as a new approach for treating bone fragility associated with OI.",

     "abstract": "Glycine substitutions in type I collagen appear to cause osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) by disrupting folding of the triple helix, the structure of which requires Gly in every third position. It is less clear, however, whether the resulting bone malformations and fragility are caused by effects of intracellular accumulation of misfolded collagen on differentiation and function of osteoblasts, effects of secreted misfolded collagen on the function of bone matrix, or both. Here we describe a study originally conceived for testing how reducing intracellular accumulation of misfolded collagen would affect mice with a Gly610 to Cys substitution in the triple helical region of the \u03b12(I) chain. To stimulate degradation of misfolded collagen by autophagy, we utilized a low protein diet. The diet had beneficial effects on osteoblast differentiation and bone matrix mineralization, but also affected bone modeling and suppressed overall animal growth. Our more important observations, however, were not related to the diet. They revealed how altered osteoblast function and deficient bone formation by each cell caused by the G610C mutation combined with increased osteoblastogenesis might make the bone more brittle, all of which are common OI features. In G610C mice, increased bone formation surface compensated for reduced mineral apposition rate, resulting in normal cortical area and thickness at the cost of altering cortical modeling process, retaining woven bone, and reducing the ability of bone to absorb energy through plastic deformation. Reduced collagen and increased mineral density in extracellular matrix of lamellar bone compounded the problem, further reducing bone toughness. The latter observations might have particularly important implications for understanding OI pathophysiology and designing more effective therapeutic interventions.",

Since MSCs can also influence hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) activities, here we investigated adult hematopoiesis in mice with Cre-mediated inactivation of the fibrillin-1 (Fbn1) gene in the mesenchyme of the forming limbs (Fbn1Prx1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice). Analyses of 3-month-old Fbn1Prx1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice revealed a statistically significant increase of circulating red blood cells, which a differentiation assay correlated with augmented erythropoiesis. This finding, together with evidence of fibrillin-1 deposition in erythroblastic niches, supported the notion that this extracellular matrix protein normally restricts differentiation of erythroid progenitors. Whereas flow cytometry measurements identified a decreased HSC frequency in mutant relative to wild type mice, no appreciable differences were noted with regard to the relative abundance and differentiation potential of myeloid progenitor cells. Together these findings implied that fibrillin-1 normally promotes HSC expansion but does not influence cell lineage commitment. Since local TGF\u03b2 hyperactivity has been associated with abnormal osteogenesis in Fbn1Prx1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice, 1-month-old mutant and wild type animals were systemically treated for 8\u00a0weeks with either a pan-TGF-\u03b2-neutralizing antibody or an antibody of the same IgG1 isotype.

Mutations in, or deletion of DMP1, cause autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets along with dental defects; DSPP mutations or its ablation are associated with dentinogenesis imperfecta. While the roles and functional mechanisms of DMP1 in osteogenesis have been extensively studied, those of DSPP in long bones have been studied only to a limited extent. Previous studies by our group revealed that transgenic expression of Dspp completely rescued the dentin defects of Dmp1-null (Dmp1\u2212/\u2212) mice. In this investigation, we assessed the effects of transgenic Dspp on osteogenesis by analyzing the formation and mineralization of the long bones in Dmp1\u2212/\u2212 mice that expresses a transgene encoding full-length DSPP driven by a 3.6-kb rat Col1a1 promoter (referred as \u201cDmp1\u2212/\u2212;Dspp-Tg mice\u201d).

In the present study we have defined the role of the extracellular matrix protein ameloblastin (AMBN) in fracture resistance and fracture healing of mouse long bones. To this end, long bones from WT and AMBN\u03945\u20136 truncation model mice were subjected to biomechanical analysis, fracture healing assays, and stem cell colony formation comparisons. The effect of exogenous AMBN addition to fracture sites was also determined. Our data indicate that lack of a functional AMBN in the bone matrix resulted in 31% decreased femur bone mass and 40% reduced energy to failure. On a cellular level, AMBN function inhibition diminished the proliferative capacity of fracture repair callus cells, as evidenced by a 58% reduction in PCNA and a 40% reduction in Cyclin D1 gene expression, as well as PCNA immunohistochemistry. In terms of fracture healing, AMBN truncation was associated with an enhanced and prolonged chondrogenic phase, resulting in delayed mineralized tissue gene expression and delayed ossification of the fracture repair callus. Underscoring a role of AMBN in fracture healing, there was a 6.9-fold increase in AMBN expression at the fracture site one week after fracture, and distinct AMBN immunolabeling in the fracture gap. Finally, application of exogenous AMBN protein to bone fracture sites accelerated callus formation and bone fracture healing (33% increase in bone volume and 19% increase in bone mineral density), validating the findings of our AMBN loss of function studies.

Cranial neural crest cell (NCC)-derived VEGF regulates proliferation, vascularization and ossification of cartilage and membranous bone. However, the function of VEGF derived from specific subpopulations of NCCs in controlling unique aspects of craniofacial morphogenesis is not clear. In this study a conditional knockdown strategy was used to genetically delete Vegfa expression in Osterix (Osx) and collagen II (Col2)-expressing NCC descendants. No major defects in calvaria and mandibular morphogenesis were observed upon knockdown of VEGF in the Col2+ cell population. In contrast, loss of VEGF in Osx+ osteoblast progenitor cells led to reduced ossification of calvarial and mandibular bones without affecting the formation of cartilage templates in newborn mice. The early stages of ossification in the developing jaw revealed decreased initial mineralization levels and a reduced thickness of the collagen I (Col1)-positive bone template upon loss of VEGF in Osx+ precursors. Increased numbers of proliferating cells were detected within the jaw mesenchyme of mutant embryos. Explant culture assays revealed that mandibular osteogenesis occurred independently of paracrine VEGF action and vascular development. Reduced VEGF expression in mandibles coincided with increased phospho-Smad1/5 (P-Smad1/5) levels and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2) expression in the jaw mesenchyme. We conclude that VEGF derived from Osx+ osteoblast progenitor cells is required for optimal ossification of developing mandibular bones and modulates mechanisms controlling BMP-dependent specification and expansion of the jaw mesenchyme.",

     "abstract": "The small proteoglycan biglycan (Bgn) is highly expressed in the organic matrix of bone and plays a role in bone formation. Previous work implicated Bgn in vessel growth during bone healing [1]. By infusing barium sulfate (BaSO4) into WT and Bgn-deficient mice we discovered the positive effect of Bgn in modulating angiogenesis during fracture healing. Using micro-computed tomography angiography we found significant differences in the vessel size and volume among other parameters. To further understand the mechanistic basis for this, we explored the relationship between Bgn and the anti-angiogenic protein endostatin. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed co-localization of Bgn and endostatin in regions of bone formation, with increased endostatin staining in Bgn-KO compared to WT at 14\u00a0days post-fracture. To further elucidate the relationship between Bgn and endostatin, an endothelial cell tube formation assay was used. This study showed that endothelial cells treated with endostatin had significantly decreased vessel length and vessel branches compared to untreated cells, while cells treated with endostatin and Bgn at a 1:1\u00a0M ratio had vessel length and vessel branches comparable to untreated cells. This indicated that Bgn was able to mitigate the inhibitory effect of endostatin on endothelial cell growth. In summary, these results suggest that Bgn is needed for proper blood vessel formation during fracture healing, and one mechanism by which Bgn impacts angiogenesis is through inhibition of endostatin.",

Thus, understanding the local cause for osteomalacia in hypophosphatemic rickets and developing an effective treatment to restore mineralization in this rare disease has been a longstanding goal in medicine. Here, we used Dmp1 knockout (KO) mice (whose mutations led to the same type of autosomal recessive hypophosphatemic rickets in humans) as the model in which the monoclonal antibody of sclerostin (Scl-Ab) was tested in two age groups for 8\u00a0weeks: the prevention group (starting at age 4\u00a0weeks) and the treatment group (starting at age 12\u00a0weeks). Applications of Scl-Ab greatly improved the osteomalacia phenotype (>\u00a015%) and the biomechanical properties (3-point bending, ~\u00a060%) in the treated long-bone group. Our studies not only showed improvement of the osteomalacia in the alveolar bone, which has the highest bone metabolism rate, as well as the long bone phenotypes in treated mice. All these improvements attributed to the use of Scl-Ab are independent of the change in serum levels of phosphorus and FGF23, since Scl-Ab had little efficacy on those parameters. Finally, we propose a model to explain how Scl-Ab can improve the Dmp1 KO osteomalacia phenotype, in which the sclerostin level is already low.",

However, it remains unclear how exercise and PTH influence the composition of bone and how exercise and PTH-mediated compositional changes influence the mechanical properties of bone. Thus, the primary purpose of this study was to establish compositional changes within osteocytes' perilacunar region of cortical bone following exercise, and evaluate the influence of endogenous PTH signaling on this perilacunar adaptation. Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) were used to evaluate tissue composition surrounding individual lacuna within the tibia of 19\u00a0week old male mice exposed to treadmill running for 3\u00a0weeks. As a result of exercise, tissue within the perilacunar region (within 0\u20135\u00a0\u03bcm of the lacuna wall) had a lower mineral-to-matrix ratio (MMR) compared to sedentary controls. In addition, exercise also increased the carbonate-to-phosphate ratio (CPR) across both perilacunar and non-perilacunar regions (5\u201310\u00a0\u03bcm and 10\u201315\u00a0\u03bcm from the lacuna walls). Tibial post-yield work had a significant negative correlation with perilacunar MMR. Inhibition of PTH activity with PTH(7-34) demonstrated that perilacunar remodeling during exercise was dependent on the cellular response to endogenous PTH. The osteocytes' response to endogenous PTH during exercise was characterized by a significant reduction in SOST expression and significant increase in FGF-23 expression. The potential reduction in phosphate levels due to FGF-23 expression may explain the increase in carbonate substitution. Overall, this is the first study to demonstrate that adaptation in tissue composition is localized around individual osteocytes, may contribute to the changes in whole bone mechanics during exercise, and that PTH signaling during exercise contributes to these adaptations.",

     "abstract": "Osteoclasts are unique cells that destroy the mineralized matrix of the skeleton. There is a \u201clove\u2013hate\u201d relationship between the osteoclasts and the bone matrix, whereby the osteoclast is stimulated by the contact with the matrix but, at the same time, it disrupts the matrix, which, in turn, counteracts this disruption by some of its components. The balance between these concerted events brings about bone resorption to be controlled and to contribute to bone tissue integrity and skeletal health. The matrix components released by osteoclasts are also involved in the local regulation of other bone cells and in the systemic control of organismal homeostasis. Disruption of this regulatory loop causes bone diseases, which may end up with either reduced or increased bone mass, often associated with poor bone quality. Expanding the knowledge on osteoclast-to-matrix interaction could help to counteract these diseases and improve the human bone health. In this article, we will present evidence of the physical, molecular and regulatory relationships between the osteoclasts and the mineralized matrix, discussing the underlying mechanisms as well as their pathologic alterations and potential targeting.",

Amelogenin RNA is alternatively spliced, resulting in at least 16 different amelogenin isoforms in mice, with M180 and LRAP expressed most abundantly. Soon after secretion by ameloblasts, M180 is cleaved by MMP20 resulting in C-terminal truncated (CTRNC) amelogenin.

     "abstract": "The epithelial ameloblasts are separated from the maturing enamel by an atypical basement membrane (BM) that is enriched in laminin 332 (LM-332). This heterotrimeric protein (\u03b13, \u00df3 and \u03b32 chains) provides structural integrity to BMs and influences various epithelial cell processes including cell adhesion and differentiation. Mouse models that lack expression of individual LM-332 chains die shortly after birth. The lethal phenotype of laminin \u03b32 knockout mice can be rescued by human laminin \u03b32 (LAMC2) expressed using a doxycycline-inducible (Tet-on) cytokeratin 14 promoter-rtTA. These otherwise normal-looking rescued mice exhibit white spot lesions on incisors. We therefore investigated the effect of rescue with human LAMC2 on enamel maturation and structuring of the atypical BM. The maturation stage enamel organ in transgenic mice was severely altered as compared to wild type controls, a structured BM was no longer discernible, dystrophic matrix appeared in the maturing enamel layer, and there was residual enamel matrix late into the maturation stage. Microtomographic scans revealed excessive wear of occlusal surfaces on molars, chipping of enamel on incisor tips, and hypomineralization of the enamel layer. No structural alterations were observed at other epithelial sites, such as skin, palate and tongue. These results indicate that while this humanized mouse model is capable of rescue in various epithelial tissues, it is unable to sustain structuring of a proper BM at the interface between ameloblasts and maturing enamel. This failure may be related to the atypical composition of the BM in the maturation stage and reaffirms that the atypical BM is essential for enamel maturation.",

No abnormalities except in enamel were observed, and no significant differences were detected in enamel thickness or volume, or in rod decussation. Micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) maximum intensity projections localized the onset of enamel maturation in wild-type incisors distal to the first molar, but mesial to this position in Amtn\u2212/\u2212, Klk4\u2212/\u2212 and Amtn\u2212/\u2212\u00a0Klk4\u2212/\u2212 mice, demonstrating a delay in enamel maturation in Amtn\u2212/\u2212 incisors. Micro-CT detected significantly reduced enamel mineral density (2.5 and 2.4\u00a0gHA/cm3) in the Klk4\u2212/\u2212 and Amtn\u2212/\u2212\u00a0Klk4\u2212/\u2212 mice respectively, compared with wild-type enamel (3.1\u00a0gHA/cm3).

The Knoop hardness of the Amtn\u2212/\u2212 outer enamel was significantly reduced relative to the wild-type and was not as hard as the middle or inner enamel. Klk4\u2212/\u2212 enamel hardness was significantly reduced at all levels, but the outer enamel was significantly harder than the inner and middle enamel. Thus the hardness patterns of the Amtn\u2212/\u2212 and Klk4\u2212/\u2212 mice were distinctly different, while the Amtn\u2212/\u2212\u00a0Klk4\u2212/\u2212 outer enamel was not as hard as in the Amtn\u2212/\u2212 and Klk4\u2212/\u2212 mice.

V-type ATPase is a multi-subunit protein complex expressed in enamel forming cells. V-type ATPase plays a key role in enamel development, specifically lysosomal acidification, yet our understanding of the relationship between the endocytotic activities and dental health and disease is limited. The objective of this study is to better understand the ameloblast-associated pH regulatory networks essential for amelogenesis. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on tissues from secretory-stage and maturation-stage enamel organs to determine which of the V-type ATPase subunits are most highly upregulated during maturation-stage amelogenesis: a time when ameloblast endocytotic activity is highest. Western blot analyses, using specific antibodies to four of the V-type ATPase subunits (Atp6v0d2, Atp6v1b2, Atp6v1c1 and Atp6v1e1), were then applied to validate much of the qPCR data. Immunohistochemistry using these same four antibodies was also performed to identify the spatiotemporal expression profiles of individual V-type ATPase subunits. Our data show that cytoplasmic V-type ATPase is significantly upregulated in enamel organ cells during maturation-stage when compared to secretory-stage. These data likely relate to the higher endocytotic activities, and the greater need for lysosomal acidification, during maturation-stage amelogenesis. It is also apparent from our immunolocalization data, using antibodies against two of the V-type ATPase subunits (Atp6v1c1 and Atp6v1e1), that significant expression is seen at the apical membrane of maturation-stage ameloblasts. Others have also identified this V-type ATPase expression profile at the apical membrane of maturation ameloblasts.

In humans many mutations have been found in DSPP and are associated with two autosomal-dominant genetic diseases \u2014 dentinogenesis imperfecta II (DGI-II) and dentin dysplasia (DD). Both disorders result in the development of hypomineralized and mechanically compromised teeth. The erupted mature molars of Dspp\u2212/\u2212 mice have a severe hypomineralized dentin phenotype. Since dentin and enamel formations are interdependent, we decided to investigate the process of enamel onset mineralization in young Dspp\u2212/\u2212 animals. We focused our analysis on the constantly erupting mouse incisor, to capture all of the stages of odontogenesis in one tooth, and the unerupted first molars. Using high-resolution microCT, we revealed that the onset of enamel matrix deposition occurs closer to the cervical loop and both secretion and maturation of enamel are accelerated in Dspp\u2212/\u2212 incisors compared to the Dspp+/\u2212 control. Importantly, these differences did not translate into major phenotypic differences in mature enamel in terms of the structural organization, mineral density or hardness. The only observable difference was the reduction in thickness of the outer enamel layer, while the total enamel thickness remained unchanged. We also observed a compromised dentin-enamel junction, leading to delamination between the dentin and enamel layers. The odontoblast processes were widened and lacked branching near the DEJ. Finally, for the first time we demonstrate expression of Dspp mRNA in secretory ameloblasts. In summary, our data show that DSPP is important for normal mineralization of both dentin and enamel.",

     "abstract": "Dental enamel is the hardest tissue in the human body, and although it starts as a tissue rich in proteins, by the time of eruption of the tooth in the oral cavity only a small fraction of the protein remains. While this organic matrix of enamel represents less than 1% by weight it plays essential roles in improving both toughness and resilience to chemical attacks. Despite the fact that the first studies of the enamel matrix began in the 19th century, its exact composition and mechanisms of its function remain poorly understood. It was proposed that keratin or a keratin-like primitive epithelial component exists in mature enamel, however due to the extreme insolubility of its organic matrix the presence of keratins there was never clearly established. We have recently identified expression of a number of hair keratins in ameloblasts, the enamel secreting cells, and demonstrated their incorporation into mature enamel. Mutation in epithelial hair keratin KRT75 leads to a skin condition called pseudofollicularis barbae. Carriers of this mutation have an altered enamel structure and mechanical properties. Importantly, these individuals have a much higher prevalence of caries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing a direct link between a mutation in a protein-coding region of a gene and increased caries rates. In this paper we present an overview of the evidence of keratin-like material in enamel that has accumulated over the last 150\u00a0years. Furthermore, we propose potential mechanisms of action of KTR75 in enamel and highlight the clinical implications of the link between mutations in KRT75 and caries.

     "abstract": "Membrane-type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT1-MMP) is a transmembrane zinc-endopeptidase that breaks down extracellular matrix components, including several collagens, during tissue development and physiological remodeling. MT1-MMP-deficient mice (MT1-MMP\u2212/\u2212) feature severe defects in connective tissues, such as impaired growth, osteopenia, fibrosis, and conspicuous loss of molar tooth eruption and root formation. In order to define the functions of MT1-MMP during root formation and tooth eruption, we analyzed the development of teeth and surrounding tissues in the absence of MT1-MMP. In situ hybridization showed that MT1-MMP was widely expressed in cells associated with teeth and surrounding connective tissues during development. Multiple defects in dentoalveolar tissues were associated with loss of MT1-MMP. Root formation was inhibited by defective structure and function of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS). However, no defect was found in creation of the eruption pathway, suggesting that tooth eruption was hampered by lack of alveolar bone modeling/remodeling coincident with reduced periodontal ligament (PDL) formation and integration with the alveolar bone. Additionally, we identified a significant defect in dentin formation and mineralization associated with the loss of MT1-MMP. To segregate these multiple defects and trace their cellular origin, conditional ablation of MT1-MMP was performed in epithelia and mesenchyme. Mice featuring selective loss of MT1-MMP activity in the epithelium were indistinguishable from wild type mice, and importantly, featured a normal HERS structure and molar eruption. In contrast, selective knock-out of MT1-MMP in Osterix-expressing mesenchymal cells, including osteoblasts and odontoblasts, recapitulated major defects from the global knock-out including altered HERS structure, short roots, defective dentin formation and mineralization, and reduced alveolar bone formation, although molars were able to erupt. These data indicate that MT1-MMP activity in the dental mesenchyme, and not in epithelial-derived HERS, is essential for proper tooth root formation and eruption. In summary, our studies point to an indispensable role for MT1-MMP-mediated matrix remodeling in tooth eruption through effects on bone formation, soft tissue remodeling and organization of the follicle/PDL region.",

Western blot analyses demonstrated that MV released from 17IIA11 cells are characterized by high levels of proteins engaged in calcium and phosphate regulation, but do not express the exosomal markers CD81 and HSP70. Furthermore, we uncovered that the molecular composition of MV released by 17IIA11 cells changes upon exposure to the classical inducers of osteogenic differentiation, namely ascorbic acid and phosphate. Specifically, lysosomal proteins Lamp1 and Lamp2a were only detected in MV secreted by cells stimulated with osteogenic factors. Quantitative nanoparticle tracking analyses of MV secreted by osteogenic cells determined that standard osteogenic factors stimulate MV secretion and that phosphate is the main driver of their secretion. On the molecular level, phosphate-induced MV secretion is mediated through activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases Erk1/2 and is accompanied by re-organization of filamentous actin. In summary, we determined that mineralization-competent MV are distinct from exosomes, and we identified a new role of phosphate in the process of ECM mineralization. These data provide novel insights into the mechanisms of MV formation during initiation of the mineralization process.",

     "abstract": "Metastasis is the major cause of death in cancer patients, and a frequent site of metastasis for many cancers is the bone marrow. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying the metastatic process is necessary for future prevention and treatment. The tumor microenvironment is now known to play a role in the metastatic cascade, both at the primary tumor and in metastatic sites, and includes both cellular and non-cellular components. The extracellular matrix (ECM) provides structural support and signaling cues to cells. One particular group of molecules associated with the ECM, known as matricellular proteins, modulate multiple aspects of tumor biology, including growth, migration, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis. These proteins are also important for normal function in the bone by regulating bone formation and bone resorption. Recent studies have described a link between some of these proteins and metastasis of various tumors to the bone. The aim of this review is to summarize what is currently known about matricellular protein influence on bone metastasis. Particular attention to the contribution of both tumor cells and non-malignant cells in the bone has been given.",

The pathogenesis of ectopic tendon mineralization and its clinical impact have not been fully elucidated yet. In this study, we utilized a mouse Achilles tendon injury model to determine whether ectopic tendon mineralization alters the biomechanical properties of the tendon and whether BMP signaling is involved in this condition. A complete transverse incision was made at the midpoint of the right Achilles tendon in 8-week-old CD1 mice and the gap was left open. Ectopic cartilaginous mass formation was found in the injured tendon by 4\u00a0weeks post-surgery and ectopic mineralization was detected at 8 to 10\u00a0weeks post-surgery. Ectopic mineralization grew over time and volume of the mineralized materials of 25-weeks samples was about 2.5 fold bigger than that of 10-weeks samples, indicating that injury-induced ectopic tendon mineralization is progressive. In vitro mechanical testing showed that max force, max stress and mid-substance modulus in the 25-weeks samples were significantly lower than the 10-weeks samples. We observed substantial increases in expression of bone morphogenetic protein family genes in injured tendons 1\u00a0week post-surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that phosphorylation of both Smad1 and Smad3 was highly increased in injured tendons as early as 1\u00a0week post-injury and remained high in ectopic chondrogenic lesions 4-weeks post-injury. Treatment with the BMP receptor kinase inhibitor (LDN193189) significantly inhibited injury-induced tendon mineralization. These findings indicate that injury-induced ectopic tendon mineralization is progressive, involves BMP signaling and associated with deterioration of tendon biomechanical properties.",

Fibrocartilaginous entheses contain fibrocartilage in their transitional zone, part of which is mineralized. Mineral-associated proteins within this zone have not been adequately characterized. Members of the S mall I ntegrin B inding Li gand N -linked G lycoprotein (SIBLING) family are acidic phosphoproteins expressed in mineralized tissues. Here we show that two SIBLING proteins, bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN), are present in the mouse enthesis. Histological analyses indicate that the calcified zone of the quadriceps tendon enthesis is longer in Bsp\u2212/\u2212 mice, however no difference is apparent in the supraspinatus tendon enthesis. In an analysis of mineral content within the calcified zone, micro-CT and Raman spectroscopy reveal that the mineral content in the calcified fibrocartilage of the quadriceps tendon enthesis are similar between wild type and Bsp\u2212/\u2212 mice. Mechanical testing of the patellar tendon shows that while the tendons fail under similar loads, the Bsp\u2212/\u2212 patellar tendon is 7.5% larger in cross sectional area than wild type tendons, resulting in a 16.5% reduction in failure stress. However, Picrosirius Red staining shows no difference in collagen organization. Data collected here indicate that BSP is present in the calcified fibrocartilage of murine entheses and suggest that BSP plays a regulatory role in this structure, influencing the growth of the calcified fibrocartilage in addition to the weakening of the tendon mechanical properties. Based on the phenotype of the Bsp\u2212/\u2212 mouse enthesis, and the known in vitro functional properties of the protein, BSP may be a useful therapeutic molecule in the reattachment of tendons and ligaments to bone.",

     "abstract": "The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a diarthrodial joint that relies on lubricants for frictionless movement and long-term function. It remains unclear what temporal and causal relationships may exist between compromised lubrication and onset and progression of TMJ disease. Here we report that Proteoglycan 4 (Prg4)-null TMJs exhibit irreversible osteoarthritis-like changes over time and are linked to formation of ectopic mineralized tissues and osteophytes in articular disc, mandibular condyle and glenoid fossa. In the presumptive layer of mutant glenoid fossa's articulating surface, numerous chondrogenic cells and/or chondrocytes emerged ectopically within the type I collagen-expressing cell population, underwent endochondral bone formation accompanied by enhanced Ihh expression, became entrapped into temporal bone mineralized matrix, and thereby elicited excessive chondroid bone formation. As the osteophytes grew, the roof of the glenoid fossa/eminence became significantly thicker and flatter, resulting in loss of its characteristic concave shape for accommodation of condyle and disc. Concurrently, the condyles became flatter and larger and exhibited ectopic bone along their neck, likely supporting the enlarged condylar heads. Articular discs lost their concave configuration, and ectopic cartilage developed and articulated with osteophytes. In glenoid fossa cells in culture, hedgehog signaling stimulated chondrocyte maturation and mineralization including alkaline phosphatase, while treatment with hedgehog inhibitor HhAntag prevented such maturation process. In sum, our data indicate that Prg4 is needed for TMJ integrity and long-term postnatal function. In its absence, progenitor cells near presumptive articular layer and disc undergo ectopic chondrogenesis and generate ectopic cartilage, possibly driven by aberrant activation of Hh signaling. The data suggest also that the Prg4-null mice represent a useful model to study TMJ osteoarthritis-like degeneration and clarify its pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The ECM of the intervertebral disc and articular cartilage contains a highly organised network of collagens and proteoglycans which resist compressive forces applied to these tissues. A pathological hallmark of the intervertebral disc is the imbalance between production of anabolic and catabolic factors by the resident cells. This process is thought to be mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines, predominantly TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which upregulate expression of matrix degrading enzymes such as MMPs and ADAMTSs. This imbalance ultimately results in tissue degeneration causing failure of the biomechanical function of the tissues. A similar cascade of events is thought to occur in articular cartilage during development of osteoarthritis. Within these skeletal tissues a small, cell surface heparan sulphate proteoglycan; syndecan-4 (SDC4) has been implicated in maintaining physiological functions. However in the degenerating niche of the intervertebral disc and cartilage, dysregulated activities of this molecule may exacerbate pathological changes. Studies in recent years have elucidated a role for SDC4 in mediating matrix degradation in both intervertebral discs and cartilage by controlling ADAMTS-5 function and MMP3 expression.

Bone's structure comprises mainly structural collagen fibrils, hydroxyapatite nanocrystals and water, and it is the organization of the densely-packed collagen matrix that directs the organization of the mineral crystallites. Biogenic mineralization occurs when osteoblasts release \u201cmineral bearing globules\u201d which fuse into the preformed collagen matrix, and upon crystallization of this amorphous precursor, the fibrils become embedded with [001] oriented nanocrystals of hydroxyapatite. Our prior work has shown that this nanostructured organization of bone can be reproduced in vitro using the polymer-induced liquid-precursor (PILP) process. In this report, our focus is on using biomimetic processing to recreate both the nano- and micro-structure of lamellar bone. We first applied molecular crowding techniques to acidic, type-I collagen solutions to form dense, liquid crystalline collagen (LCC) scaffolds with cholesteric order. We subsequently mineralized these LCCs via the PILP process to achieve a high degree of intrafibrillar mineral, with compositions and organization similar to that of native bone and with a \u201clamellar\u201d microstructure generated by the twisting LCC template. In depth characterization of the nano- and micro-structure was performed, including optical and electron microscopy, X-ray and electron diffraction, and thermogravimetric analyses. The results of this work lead us closer to our goal of developing hierarchically structured, collagen-hydroxyapatite composites which can serve as fully synthetic, bioresorbable, load-bearing bone substitutes that are remodeled by the native BRU.",

     "abstract": "For more than 100\u00a0years, cells and tissues have been studied in vitro using glass and plastic surfaces. Over the last 10\u201320\u00a0years, a great body of research has shown that cells are acutely sensitive to their local environment (extracellular matrix, ECM) which contains both chemical and physical cues that influence cell behavior. These observations suggest that modern cell culture systems, using tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) surfaces, may fail to reproduce authentic cell behavior in vitro, resulting in \u201cartificial outcomes.\u201d In the current study, we use bone marrow (BM)- and adipose (AD)-derived stromal cells to prepare BM-ECM and AD-ECM, which are decellularized after synthesis by the cells, to mimic the cellular niche for each of these tissues. Each ECM was characterized for its ability to affect BM- and AD-mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) proliferation, as well as proliferation of three cancer cell lines (HeLa, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-231), modulate cell spreading, and direct differentiation relative to standard TCP surfaces. We found that both ECMs promoted the proliferation of MSCs, but that this effect was enhanced when the tissue-origin of the cells matched that of the ECM (i.e. BM-ECM promoted the proliferation of BM-MSCs over AD-MSCs, and vice versa). Moreover, BM- and AD-ECM were shown to preferentially direct MSC differentiation towards either osteogenic or adipogenic lineage, respectively, suggesting that the effects of the ECM were tissue-specific. Further, each ECM influenced cell morphology (i.e. circularity), irrespective of the origin of the MSCs, lending more support to the idea that effects were tissue specific. Interestingly, unlike MSCs, these ECMs did not promote the proliferation of the cancer cells. In an effort to further understand how these three culture substrates influence cell behavior, we evaluated the chemical (protein composition) and physical properties (architecture and mechanical) of the two ECMs. While many structural proteins (e.g. collagen and fibronectin) were found at equivalent levels in both BM- and AD-ECM, the architecture (i.e. fiber orientation; surface roughness) and physical properties (storage modulus, surface energy) of each were unique. These results, demonstrating differences in cell behavior when cultured on the three different substrates (BM- and AD-ECM and TCP) with differences in chemical and physical properties, provide evidence that the two ECMs may recapitulate specific elements of the native stem cell niche for bone marrow and adipose tissues. More broadly, it could be argued that ECMs, elaborated by cells ex vivo, serve as an ideal starting point for developing tissue-specific culture environments. In contrast to TCP, which relies on the \u201cone size fits all\u201d paradigm, native tissue-specific ECM may be a more rational model to approach engineering 3D tissue-specific culture systems to replicate the in vivo niche. We suggest that this approach will provide more meaningful information for basic research studies of cell behavior as well as cell-based therapeutics.",

     "abstract": "Fibrotic diseases constitute a world-wide major health problem, but research support remains inadequate in comparison to the need. Although considerable understanding of the pathogenesis of fibrotic reactions has been attained, no completely effective therapies exist. Although fibrotic disorders are diverse, it is universally appreciated that a particular cell type with unique characteristics, the myofibroblast, is responsible for replacement of functioning tissue with non-functional scar tissue. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the creation of myofibroblasts and their activities is central to the development of therapies. Critical signaling cascades, initiated primarily by TGF-\u03b2, but also involving other cytokines which stimulate pro-fibrotic reactions in the myofibroblast, offer potential therapeutic targets. However, because of the multiplicity and complex interactions of these signaling pathways, it is very unlikely that any single drug will be successful in modifying a major fibrotic disease. Therefore, we have chosen to examine the effectiveness of administration of several drug combinations in a mouse pneumoconiosis model. Such treatment proved to be effective. Because fibrotic diseases that tend to be chronic, are difficult to monitor, and are patient variable, implementation of clinical trials is difficult and expensive. Therefore, we have made efforts to identify and validate non-invasive biomarkers found in urine and blood. We describe the potential utility of five such markers: (i) the EDA form of fibronectin (FnEDA), (ii) lysyl oxidase (LOX), (iii) lysyl oxidase-like protein 2 (LoxL2), (iv) connective tissue growth factor (CTGF, CCNII), and (v) the N-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP).",

SSc is considered to be the prototypic systemic fibrotic disorder. Despite currently available therapeutic approaches SSc has a high mortality rate owing to the development of SSc-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), complications that have emerged as the most frequent causes of disability and mortality in SSc. The pathogenesis of the fibrotic process in SSc is complex and despite extensive investigation the exact mechanisms have remained elusive. Myofibroblasts are the cells ultimately responsible for tissue fibrosis and fibroproliferative vasculopathy in SSc. Tissue myofibroblasts in SSc originate from several sources including expansion of quiescent tissue fibroblasts and tissue accumulation of CD34\u00a0+ fibrocytes. Besides these sources, myofibroblasts in SSc may result from the phenotypic conversion of endothelial cells into activated myofibroblasts, a process known as endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). Recently, it has been postulated that EndoMT may play a role in the development of SSc-associated ILD and PAH. However, although several studies have described the occurrence of EndoMT in experimentally induced cardiac, renal, and pulmonary fibrosis and in several human disorders, the contribution of EndoMT to SSc-associated ILD and PAH has not been generally accepted.

The etiology of keloids is unknown but they occur after dermal injury in genetically susceptible individuals, and they cause both physical and psychological distress for the affected individuals. Several treatment methods for keloids exist, including the combination therapy of surgical excision followed by intralesional steroid therapy, however, they have high recurrence rate regardless of the current treatment method. Improved understanding of the pathomechanisms leading to keloid formation will hopefully identify pathways that serve as specific targets to improve therapy for this devastating, currently intractable, disorder.",

     "abstract": "Peritoneal adhesions, primarily caused by surgical procedures, are the leading cause of pelvic pain, bowel obstruction, and infertility. TGF-\u03b21 and IL-6 have been found to be elevated in the peritoneal fluid of patients during/after abdominal surgery. However, it remains to be determined whether these cytokines interact and facilitate adhesion formation by promoting mesothelial to mesenchymal transition (MMT). In the present study, isolated rat peritoneal mesothelial cells were treated with TGF-\u03b21 and/or IL-6 which elicited MMT as determined by morphologic and biochemical techniques. During this transition, cellular morphology changed from that of cobblestone polygonal cells to elongated/spindle-shaped fibroblast-like cells. There was decreased expression of genes characteristic of mesothelial cells, such as E-cadherin, and increased expression of genes characteristic of the myofibroblast phenotype, including \u03b1-smooth muscle actin and the EDA form of fibronectin, both of which appear to mediate the transfer of force to the extracellular matrix. Partial characterization of relevant signaling pathways identified Erk1/2 activation, which was enhanced by combined TGF-\u03b21/IL-6 administration, as a crucial necessary factor in the transition. Erk1/2 activation as well as the phosphorylation of the linker region of Smad2 and MMT could be blocked by the MEK inhibitor, U0126, suggesting that such activation may be a potential pharmaceutical target to prevent MMT. In addition, the phenotypic transition could be prevented by hydrocortisone.",

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is the major determinant of GP biomechanical properties and assumed to play a pivotal role for chondrocyte geometry and arrangement, thereby guiding proper growth plate morphogenesis and bone elongation. To elucidate the relationship between morphology and biomechanics during cartilage morphogenesis, we have investigated age-dependent structural and elastic properties of the proliferative zone of the murine GP by atomic force microscopy (AFM) from the embryonic stage to adulthood. We observed a progressive cell flattening and arrangement into columns from embryonic day 13.5 until postnatal week 2, correlating with an increasing collagen density and ECM stiffness, followed by a nearly constant cell shape, collagen density and ECM stiffness from week 2 to 4\u00a0months. At all ages, we found marked differences in the density and organization of the collagen network between the intracolumnar matrix, and the intercolumnar matrix, associated with a roughly two-fold higher stiffness of the intracolumnar matrix compared to the intercolumnar matrix. This difference in local ECM stiffness may force the cells to arrange in a columnar structure upon cell division and drive bone elongation during embryonic and juvenile development.",

Potential sources of cells to augment the clinical repair of cartilage defects include autologous chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. We have reported that culture of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells with specific growth and differentiation factors as shallow multilayers on Transwell permeable membranes provided ideal conditions for chondrogenesis. Rigid translucent cartilaginous disks formed and expressed cartilage-specific structural proteins aggrecan and type II collagen. We report here the analysis of the collagen network assembled in these cartilage constructs and identify key features of the network as it became mature during 28\u00a0days of culture. The type II collagen was co-polymerized with types XI and IX collagens in a fibrillar network stabilized by hydroxylysyl pyridinoline cross-links as in epiphyseal and hyaline cartilages. Tandem ion-trap mass-spectrometry identified 3-hydroxylation of Proline 986 and Proline 944 of the \u03b11(II) chains, a post-translational feature of human epiphyseal cartilage type II collagen. The formation of a type II collagen based hydroxy-lysyl pyridinoline cross-linked network typical of cartilage in 28\u00a0days shows that the Transwell system not only produces, secretes and assembles cartilage collagens, but also provides all the extracellular mechanisms to modify and generate covalent cross-links that determine a robust collagen network. This organized assembly explains the stiff, flexible nature of the cartilage constructs developed from hMSCs in this culture system.",

     "abstract": "Perlecan/HSPG2, a large, monomeric heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG), is a key component of the lacunar canalicular system (LCS) of cortical bone, where it is part of the mechanosensing pericellular matrix (PCM) surrounding the osteocytic processes and serves as a tethering element that connects the osteocyte cell body to the bone matrix. Within the pericellular space surrounding the osteocyte cell body, perlecan can experience physiological fluid flow drag force and in that capacity function as a sensor to relay external stimuli to the osteocyte cell membrane. We previously showed that a reduction in perlecan secretion alters the PCM fiber composition and interferes with bone's response to a mechanical loading in vivo. To test our hypothesis that perlecan core protein can sustain tensile forces without unfolding under physiological loading conditions, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to capture images of perlecan monomers at nanoscale resolution and to perform single molecule force measurement (SMFMs). We found that the core protein of purified full-length human perlecan is of suitable size to span the pericellular space of the LCS, with a measured end-to-end length of 170\u00a0\u00b1\u00a020\u00a0nm and a diameter of 2\u20134\u00a0nm. Force pulling revealed a strong protein core that can withstand over 100\u00a0pN of tension well over the drag forces that are estimated to be exerted on the individual osteocyte tethers. Data fitting with an extensible worm-like chain model showed that the perlecan protein core has a mean elastic constant of 890\u00a0pN and a corresponding Young's modulus of 71\u00a0MPa. We conclude that perlecan has physical properties that would allow it to act as a strong but elastic tether in the LCS.",

     "abstract": "Galectin-3 is highly expressed in notochordal nucleus pulposus (NP) and thought to play important physiological roles; however, regulation of its expression remains largely unexplored. The aim of the study was to investigate if TGF\u03b2 regulates Galectin-3 expression in NP cells. TGF\u03b2 treatment resulted in decreased Galectin-3 expression. Bioinformatic analysis using JASPAR and MatInspector databases cross-referenced with published ChIP-Seq data showed nine locations of highly probable Smad3 binding in the LGALS3 proximal promoter. In NP cells, TGF\u03b2 treatment resulted in decreased activity of reporters harboring several 5\u2032 deletions of the proximal Galectin-3 promoter. While transfection of NP cells with constitutively active (CA)-ALK5 resulted in decreased promoter activity, DN-ALK5 blocked the suppressive effect of TGF\u03b2 on the promoter. The suppressive effect of Smad3 on the Galectin-3 promoter was confirmed using gain- and loss-of-function studies. Transfection with DN-Smad3 or Smad7 blocked TGF\u03b2 mediated suppression of promoter activity. We also measured Galectin-3 promoter activity in Smad3 null and wild type cells. Noteworthy, promoter activity was suppressed by TGF\u03b2 only in wild type cells. Likewise, stable silencing of Smad3 in NP cells using sh-Smad3 significantly blocked TGF\u03b2-dependent decrease in Galectin-3 expression. Treatment of human NP cells isolated from tissues with different grades of degeneration showed that Galectin-3 expression was responsive to TGF-\u03b2-mediated suppression. Importantly, Galectin-3 synergized effects of TNF-\u03b1 on inflammatory gene expression by NP cells. Together these studies suggest that TGF\u03b2, through Smad3 controls Galectin-3 expression in NP cells and may have implications in the intervertebral disc degeneration.",

In order to elucidate the role of fibulin-4 in bone structure and skeletal development, we analyzed structural changes in skeletal tissues of Fbln4\u2212/\u2212 mice. Immunostaining confirmed that fibulin-4 is highly expressed in cartilage, bone, ligaments and tendons. No morphological abnormalities were found in the skeleton of Fbln4\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared to wild type littermates except forelimb contractures as well as unusually thick collagen fibrils. Furthermore, fibulin-4 deficiency caused enhanced susceptibility of bone collagen for acid extraction, consistent with significantly reduced lysylpyridinoline and hydroxylysylpyridinoline cross-links in bone. In accordance with that, the amount of lysyl oxidase in long bones and calvaria was strongly decreased and proteolytic activation of lysyl oxidase was reduced in fibulin-4 deficient osteoblasts, while addition of recombinant fibulin-4 rescued the activation. The finding suggested that fibulin-4 is important for the proteolytic activation of lysyl oxidase which has a pivotal role in cross-linking of collagen and elastin.",

In the present study, we modulated versican expression using siRNAs in the human leiomyosarcoma (LMS) smooth muscle cell line SK-LMS-1, and observed the formation of elastin and elastic fibers in vitro and also in vivo in a nude mouse tumor model. Constitutive siRNA-directed knockdown of versican in LMS cells resulted in increased levels of elastin, as shown by immunohistochemical staining of the cells in vitro, and by mRNA and protein analyses. Moreover, versican siRNA LMS cells, when injected into nude mice, generated smaller tumors that had significantly greater immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for elastin when compared to control tumors. Additionally, microarray analyses were used to determine the influence of versican isoform modulation on gene expression profiles, and to identify genes that influence and relate to the process of elastogenesis. cDNA microarray analysis and TaqMan low density array validation identified previously unreported genes associated with downregulation of versican and increased elastogenesis. These results highlight an important role for the proteoglycan versican in regulating the expression and assembly of elastin and the phenotype of LMS cells.",

     "abstract": "Secreted and membrane tethered matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are key homeostatic proteases regulating the extracellular signaling and structural matrix environment of cells and tissues. For drug targeting of proteases, selectivity for individual molecules is highly desired and can be met by high yield active site specificity profiling. Using the high throughput Proteomic Identification of protease Cleavage Sites (PICS) method to simultaneously profile both the prime and non-prime sides of the cleavage sites of nine human MMPs, we identified more than 4300 cleavages from P6 to P6\u2032 in biologically diverse human peptide libraries. MMP specificity and kinetic efficiency were mainly guided by aliphatic and aromatic residues in P1\u2032 (with a ~\u00a032\u201393% preference for leucine depending on the MMP), and basic and small residues in P2\u2032 and P3\u2032, respectively. A wide differential preference for the hallmark P3 proline was found between MMPs ranging from 15 to 46%, yet when combined in the same peptide with the universally preferred P1\u2032 leucine, an unexpected negative cooperativity emerged. This was not observed in previous studies, probably due to the paucity of approaches that profile both the prime and non-prime sides together, and the masking of subsite cooperativity effects by global heat maps and iceLogos. These caveats make it critical to check for these biologically highly important effects by fixing all 20 amino acids one-by-one in the respective subsites and thorough assessing of the inferred specificity logo changes. Indeed an analysis of bona fide MEROPS physiological substrate cleavage data revealed that of the 37 natural substrates with either a P3-Pro or a P1\u2032-Leu only 5 shared both features, confirming the PICS data. Upon probing with several new quenched-fluorescent peptides, rationally designed on our specificity data, the negative cooperativity was explained by reduced non-prime side flexibility constraining accommodation of the rigidifying P3 proline with leucine locked in S1\u2032. Similar negative cooperativity between P3 proline and the novel preference for asparagine in P1 cements our conclusion that non-prime side flexibility greatly impacts MMP binding affinity and cleavage efficiency. Thus, unexpected sequence cooperativity consequences were revealed by PICS that uniquely encompasses both the non-prime and prime sides flanking the proteomic-pinpointed scissile bond.",

     "abstract": "Biglycan, a ubiquitous proteoglycan, acts as a danger signal when released from the extracellular matrix. As such, biglycan triggers the synthesis and maturation of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-, TLR4-, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. Here, we discovered that biglycan autonomously regulates the balance in IL-1\u03b2 production in vitro and in vivo by modulating expression, activity and stability of NADPH oxidase (NOX) 1, 2 and 4 enzymes via different TLR pathways. In primary murine macrophages, biglycan triggered NOX1/4-mediated ROS generation, thereby enhancing IL-1\u03b2 expression. Surprisingly, biglycan inhibited IL-1\u03b2 due to enhancement of NOX2 synthesis and activation, by selectively interacting with TLR4. Synthesis of NOX2 was mediated by adaptor molecule Toll/IL-1R domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF). Via myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88) as well as Rac1 activation and Erk phosphorylation, biglycan triggered translocation of the cytosolic NOX2 subunit p47phox to the plasma membrane, an obligatory step for NOX2 activation. In contrast, by engaging TLR2, soluble biglycan stimulated the expression of heat shock protein (HSP) 70, which bound to NOX2, and consequently impaired the inhibitory function of NOX2 on IL-1\u03b2 expression. Notably, a genetic background lacking biglycan reduced HSP70 expression, rescued the enhanced renal IL-1\u03b2 production and improved kidney function of Nox2\u2010/y mice in a model of renal ischemia reperfusion injury. Here, we provide a novel mechanism where the danger molecule biglycan influences NOX2 synthesis and activation via different TLR pathways, thereby regulating inflammation severity. Thus, selective inhibition of biglycan-TLR2 or biglycan-TLR4 signaling could be a novel therapeutic approach in ROS-mediated inflammatory diseases.",

An essential step during biosynthesis of HS is the epimerization of d-glucuronic to l-iduronic acid by the enzyme glucuronyl C5-epimerase (Hsepi or Glce). Here we have investigated chondrocyte differentiation in Glce deficient mice and found increased regions of proliferating chondrocytes accompanied by a delayed onset of hypertrophic differentiation. In addition, we observed increased expression levels of the Ihh target genes Patched1 (Ptch1) and Parathyroid hormone related peptide (Pthrp; Parathyroid hormone like hormone (Pthlh)) indicating elevated Ihh signaling.

They are secreted as heterotrimeric proteins consisting of one \u03b1, one \u03b2, and one \u03b3 chain, followed by their assembly into a polymer-like sheet at the basement membrane. Using sedimentation velocity, dynamic light scattering, and surface plasmon resonance experiments, we studied self-association of three laminin (LM) N-terminal fragments \u03b1-1 (hLM \u03b1-1\u00a0N), \u03b1-5 (hLM \u03b1-5\u00a0N) and \u03b2-3 (hLM \u03b2-3\u00a0N) originating from the short arms of the human laminin \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 heterotrimer. Corresponding studies of the hLM \u03b1-1\u00a0N C49S mutant, equivalent to the larval lethal C56S mutant in zebrafish, have shown that this mutation causes enhanced self-association behavior, an observation that provides a plausible explanation for the inability of laminin bearing this mutation to fulfill functional roles in vivo, and hence for the deleterious pathological consequences of the mutation on lens function.",

     "abstract": "Collagen XXVIII is the last discovered member of the collagen superfamily and thus has been only sparsely investigated. We studied collagen XXVIII in zebrafish to gain insight into its structure, evolution and expression. In contrast to human and mouse, the zebrafish genome contains four collagen XXVIII genes, col28a1a and -b, and col28a2a and -b. Genomic context and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the a2 branch was lost during evolution of mammals, whereas the duplication of the a1 and a2 branches results from the whole genome duplication in the teleost lineage. Sequence analysis revealed conservation of domain structure and the unique imperfections in the triple helical domain. Two major forms of collagen XXVIII were identified, Col28a1b in adult and Col28a2a in 3\u20135\u00a0dpf zebrafish. Composite agarose/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that both these chains mainly form dimers of trimers, although Col28a1b appears to be more polydisperse. Homodimers are abundant, although it is possible that complexes consisting of Col28a2a and Col28a1a or -a2b occur. Peptide mass fingerprint analysis revealed that the C-terminal Kunitz domain is often proteolytically processed. In contrast to murine collagen XXVIII, the zebrafish orthologs are widely expressed and not only present in the nervous system. They are differentially expressed in the liver, thymus, muscle, intestine and skin. Altogether our results point to a unique nature of collagen XXVIII within the collagen family.",

Clinical manifestations associated with mutations of the human COL4A1 gene include perinatal cerebral hemorrhage and porencephaly, hereditary angiopathy, nephropathy, aneurysms and muscle cramps (HANAC), ocular dysgenesis, myopathy, Walker\u2013Warburg syndrome and systemic tissue degeneration. In Drosophila, the phenotype associated with dominant temperature sensitive mutations of col4a1 include severe myopathy resulting from massive degradation of striated muscle fibers, and in the gut, degeneration of circular visceral muscle cells and epithelial cells following detachment from the BM. In order to determine the consequences of altered BM functions due to aberrant COL4A1 protein, we have carried out a series of tests using DrosophilaDTS-L3 mutants from our allelic series of col4a1 mutations with confirmed degeneration of various cell types and lowest survival rate among the col4a1 mutant lines at restrictive temperature. Results demonstrated epithelial cell degeneration in the gut, shortened gut, enlarged midgut with multiple diverticulae, intestinal dysfunction and shortened life span. Midgut immunohistochemistry analyses confirmed altered expression and distribution of BM components integrin PSI and PSII alpha subunits, laminin gamma 1, and COL4A1 both in larvae and adults. Global gene expression analysis revealed activation of the effector AMP genes of the primary innate immune system including Metchnikowin, Diptericin, DiptericinB, and edin that preceded morphological changes. Attacin::GFP midgut expression pattern further supported these changes. An increase in ROS production and changes in gut bacterial flora were also noted and may have further enhanced an immune response. The phenotypic features of Drosophila col4a1 mutants confirmed an essential role for type IV collagen in maintaining epithelial integrity, gut morphology and intestinal function and suggest that aberrant structure and function of the COL4A1 protein may also be a significant factor in modulating immunity.",

Further, polymorphisms in Col IX are known risk factors for the development of early intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. To understand the role of Col IX in the pathogenesis of IVD disorders, the spine of newborn and older Col IX deficient mice was systematically analyzed and compared to C57BL/6N controls. Morphology and bone parameters of the spine from newborn, 6 and 10\u00a0months old animals were investigated using \u03bcCT measurements. Histological staining was used to evaluate tissue structure and degree of degeneration. Localization and expression of extracellular matrix proteins was analyzed in depth by immunofluorescence staining, immunoblotting, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization. High resolution imaging and stiffness measurements were performed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Vertebral bodies of newborn Col IX-deficient mice were smaller and showed an increased mineral density compared to wild type animals. At birth, lack of Col IX led to a disrupted cellular organization in the cartilaginous endplate and a smaller nucleus pulposus of the IVD. Expression levels and localization of other extracellular matrix proteins were strongly altered accompanied by a softening of cartilaginous tissues. In older animals, absence of Col IX caused earlier and more pronounced disc degeneration with annular fissures.The absence of Col IX induces early developmental, structural and biomechanical alterations in both vertebral body and intervertebral disc which eventually cause severe degenerative changes in the aging spine.",

Thus, we tested whether pro-autophagic stimuli could affect decorin expression in mouse cardiac tissue and whether the absence of decorin could disrupt the in vivo autophagic response. We found that nutrient deprivation induced decorin at the mRNA and protein level in vivo and in vitro, a process regulated at the transcriptional level by inhibiting the canonical mTOR pathway. Moreover, Dcn\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice displayed an aberrant response to fasting compared to wild-type mice.

However, the association between autophagy and perlecan in muscle homeostasis remains unclear. The mechanical unloading of perlecan-deficient soleus muscles resulted in significantly decreased wet weights and cross-section fiber area compared with those of control mice. We found that perlecan deficiency in slow-twitch soleus muscles enhanced autophagic activity. This was accompanied by a decrease in autophagic substrates, such as p62, and an increase in LC3II levels. Furthermore, perlecan deficiency caused a reduction in the phosphorylation levels of p70S6k and Akt and increased the phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1.

Previous work of others has suggested that the hyaluronidase isoform HYAL2 has the capacity to bind to CD44, a binding that may itself induce CD44 cleavage. Experiments were developed to elucidate whether chondrocyte HYAL2: (1) was exposed on the extracellular plasma membrane of chondrocytes, (2) bound to CD44, (3) underwent shedding together with CD44 and lastly, (4) exhibited hyaluronidase activity within a near-neutral pH range. Enhancing CD44 shedding by IL-1\u03b2 resulted in a proportional increase in HYAL2 released from human and bovine chondrocytes into the medium. CD44 knockdown by siRNA also resulted in increased accumulation of HYAL2 in the media of chondrocytes. By hyaluronan zymography only activity at pH\u00a03.7 was observed and this activity was reduced by pre-treatment of chondrocytes with trypsin. CD44 and HYAL2 were found to co-immunoprecipitate, and to co-localize within intracellular vesicles and at the plasma membrane. Degradation of hyaluronan was visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. With this approach, hyaluronidase activity could be observed at pH\u00a04.8 under assay conditions in which CD44 and HYAL2 binding remained intact; additionally, weak hyaluronidase activity could be observed at pH\u00a06.8 under these conditions. This study suggests that CD44 and HYAL2 are bound at the surface of chondrocytes. The release of HYAL2 when CD44 is shed could provide a mechanism for weak hyaluronidase activity to occur within the more distant extracellular matrix of cartilage.",

In some cases, EMT up-regulates the cancer stem cell marker CD44S and the enzyme hyaluronic acid synthase-2 (HAS2). CD44S is the major receptor for hyaluronan in the extracellular matrix. Herein, we demonstrate that CD44S, unlike the CD44E isoform expressed in normal epithelial cells, contributes to the protection against anoikis.

A prominent signaling pathway is the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk MAPK pathway, which increases expression of genes that promote melanoma progression. Many melanomas harbor a mutation in this pathway, BRAFV600E, which constitutively activates MAPK signaling and expression of downstream target genes that facilitate tumor progression. In BRAFV600E melanoma, the small molecule inhibitor, vemurafenib (PLX4032), has revolutionized therapy for melanoma by inducing rapid tumor regression. This compound down-regulates the expression of many genes. However, in this study, we document that blocking the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk MAPK pathway, either with an ERK (PLX4032) or a MEK (U1026) signaling inhibitor, in BRAFV600E human and murine melanoma cell lines increases collagen synthesis in vitro and collagen deposition in vivo. Since TGF\u00df signaling is a major mediator of collagen synthesis, we examined whether blocking TGF\u00df signaling with a small molecule inhibitor would block this increase in collagen. However, there was minimal reduction in collagen synthesis in response to blocking TGF\u00df signaling, suggesting additional mechanism(s), which may include activation of the p38 MAPK pathway. Presently, it is unclear whether this increased collagen synthesis and deposition in melanomas represent a therapeutic benefit or an unwanted \u201coff target\u201d effect of inhibiting the Ras-Raf-Erk-Mek pathway.",

The most abundant AGE, glucosepane, accumulates in collagen with concentrations over 100 times greater than all other AGEs. Detrimental collagen stiffening properties are believed to play a significant role in several age-related diseases such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Currently little is known of the potential location of covalently cross-linked glucosepane formation within collagen molecules; neither are there reports on how the respective cross-link sites affect the physical and biochemical properties of collagen. Using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations (MD) we have identified six sites where the formation of a covalent intra-molecular glucosepane cross-link within a single collagen molecule in a fibrillar environment is energetically favourable. Identification of these favourable sites enables us to align collagen cross-linking with experimentally observed changes to the ECM. For example, formation of glucosepane was found to be energetically favourable within close proximity of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-1 (MMP1) binding site, which could potentially disrupt collagen degradation.",

Ectopia lentis occurs in each of these conditions except geleophysic dysplasia, and is due to a defect in the ciliary zonule, which is predominantly composed of FBN1 microfibrils.

     "abstract": "The LTBPs (or latent transforming growth factor \u03b2 binding proteins) are important components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) that interact with fibrillin microfibrils and have a number of different roles in microfibril biology. There are four LTBPs isoforms in the human genome (LTBP-1, \u2212\u00a02, \u2212\u00a03, and \u2212\u00a04), all of which appear to associate with fibrillin and the biology of each isoform is reviewed here.The LTBPs were first identified as forming latent complexes with TGF\u03b2 by covalently binding the TGF\u03b2 propeptide (LAP) via disulfide bonds in the endoplasmic reticulum. LAP in turn is cleaved from the mature TGF\u03b2 precursor in the trans-golgi network but LAP and TGF\u03b2 remain strongly bound through non-covalent interactions. LAP, TGF\u03b2, and LTBP together form the large latent complex (LLC). LTBPs were originally thought to primarily play a role in maintaining TGF\u03b2 latency and targeting the latent growth factor to the extracellular matrix (ECM), but it has also been shown that LTBP-1 participates in TGF\u03b2 activation by integrins and may also regulate activation by proteases and other factors. LTBP-3 appears to have a role in skeletal formation including tooth development. As well as having important functions in TGF\u03b2 regulation, TGF\u03b2-independent activities have recently been identified for LTBP-2 and LTBP-4 in stabilizing microfibril bundles and regulating elastic fiber assembly.",

     "abstract": "Physiological tissue repair aims at restoring the mechano-protective properties of the extracellular matrix. Consequently, redundant regulatory mechanisms are in place ensuring that tissue remodeling terminates once matrix homeostasis is re-established. If these mechanisms fail, stromal cells become continuously activated, accumulate excessive amounts of stiff matrix, and fibrosis develops. In this mini-review, I develop the hypothesis that the mechanical state of the extracellular matrix and the pro-fibrotic transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 cooperate to regulate the remodeling activities of stromal cells. TGF-\u03b21 is stored in the matrix as part of a large latent complex and can be activated by cell contractile force that is transmitted by integrins. Matrix straining and stiffening lower the threshold for TGF-\u03b21 activation by increasing the mechanical resistance to cell pulling. Different elements of this mechanism can be pharmacologically targeted to interrupt the mechanical positive feedback loop of fibrosis, including specific integrins and matrix protein interactions.",

     "abstract": "ADAMTS5 (TS5), a member of the aggrecanase clade (TS1, 4, 5, 8, 9, 15) of ADAMTS-proteases, has been considered largely responsible for the proteolysis of the hyalectans, aggrecan (Acan) and versican (Vcan), in vivo. However, we have reported that ts5-knockout (KO) mice show joint protection after injury due to inhibition of synovial scarring and enhanced Acan deposition. Also, KO mice have an impaired wound healing phenotype in skin and tendons which is associated with Acan/Vcan-rich deposits at the wound sites. Moreover, the Acan and Vcan deposited was aggrecanase-cleaved, even in the absence of TS5. In this study, we have used adipose-derived stromal cell (ADSC) and epiphyseal chondrocyte cultures from wild type and KO mice to further study the role of TS5 in Acan and Vcan turnover. We have confirmed with both cell types that the aggrecanase-mediated degradation of these hyalectans is not due to TS5, but an aggrecanase which primarily cleaves them before they are secreted. We also provide data which suggests that TS5 protein functions to suppress glucose uptake in ADSCs and thereby inhibits the synthesis, and promotes the intracellular degradation of Acan and Vcan by an ADAMTS other than TS5. We propose that this apparently non-proteolytic role of TS5 explains its anti-chondrogenic and pro-fibrotic effects in murine models of wound repair. A possible role for TS5 in an endocytotic process, involving competitive interactions between TS5, LRP1 and GLUT4 is discussed.",

     "abstract": "Skin aging is a complex phenomenon in which several mechanisms operate simultaneously. Among them, intrinsic aging is a time-dependent process, which leads to gradual skin changes affecting its structure and function such as thinning down of both epidermal and dermal compartments and a flattening and fragility of the dermo-epidermal junction. Today, several approaches have been proposed for the generation of aged skin in vitro, including skin explants from aged donors and three-dimensional skin equivalent treated by aging-inducing chemical compounds or engineered with human cells isolated from aged donors.The aim of this study was to develop and validate a new in vitro model of aging based on skin equivalent demonstrating the same phenotypic changes that were observed in chronological aging.By using prolonged culture as a proxy for cellular aging, we extended to 120\u00a0days the culture time of a skin equivalent model based on collagen\u2013glycosaminoglycan\u2013chitosan porous polymer and engineered with human skin cells from photo-protected sites of young donors. Morphological, immunohistological and ultrastructural analysis at different time points of the culture allowed characterizing the phenotypic changes observed in our model in comparison to samples of non photo-exposed normal human skin from different ages.We firstly confirmed that long-term cultured skin equivalents are still morphologically consistent and functionally active even after 120\u00a0days of culture. However, similar to in vivo chronological skin aging a significant decrease of the epidermis thickness as well as the number of keratinocyte expressing proliferation marker Ki67 are observed in extended culture time skin equivalent. Epidermal differentiation markers loricrin, filaggrin, involucrin and transglutaminase, also strongly decreased. Ultrastructural analysis of basement membrane showed typical features of aged skin such as duplication of lamina densa and alterations of hemidesmosomes. Moreover, the expression of hyaluronan and its surface receptor CD44 drastically decreased as observed during chronological skin aging. Finally, we found that the level of p16INK4A expression significantly increased supporting cellular senescence process associated to our model.To conclude, the major morphological and ultrastructural epidermal modifications observed in both our extended culture skin equivalent model and skin biopsies from old donors validate the relevance of our model for studying chronological aging, understanding and elucidating age-related modifications of basic skin biological processes. In addition, our model provides a unique tool for identifying new targeted molecules intended at improving the appearance of aging skin.",

     "abstract": "This issue of Matrix Biology is devoted to exploring how metalloproteinases \u2013 here inclusive of related families of extracellular proteinases \u2013 act on extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to influence an astonishing diversity of biological systems and diseases. Since their discovery in the 1960's, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have oft and widely been considered as the principal mediators of ECM destruction. However, as becomes clear from several articles in this issue, MMPs affect processes that both promote and limit ECM assembly, structure, and quantity. Furthermore, it has become increasingly apparent that ECM proteolysis is neither the exclusive function of MMPs nor their only sphere of influence. Thus, other enzymes may be important participants in ECM proteolysis, and indeed they are. The ADAMTS ( a d isintegrin-like a nd m etalloproteinase domain with t hrombo s pondin type 1 repeat) proteinases, BMP/tolloid proteases, and meprins have all emerged as major mechanisms of ECM proteolysis. An aggregate view of proteolysis as an exquisitely specific and crucial post-translational modification of secreted proteins emerges from these reviews. The cumulative evidence strongly suggests that although some MMPs can and do cleave ECM components, notably fibrillar collagens, the majority of these proteinases are not key physiological participants in morphogenesis nor in control of matrix metabolism in homeostasis or disease. In contrast, deficiency of ADAMTS proteases leads to a remarkable array of morphogenetic defects and connective tissue disorders consistent with a specialized role in turnover of the embryonic provisional ECM and in ECM assembly. Astacin-related proteases emerge into crucial positions in ECM assembly and turnover, although they also have numerous roles related to morphogen and growth factor regulation. To further turn the traditional view on its head, it is clear that many MMPs are key participants in many, diverse immune and inflammation processes rather than ECM proteolysis. The overlap in the activities within and between these families leads to the view that ECM proteolysis, which is indispensable for life, was over-engineered to an extraordinary extent during vertebrate evolution. That these proteinases, which likely evolved within networks regulating morphogenesis, immunity and regeneration, also participate in diseases is a side effect of human longevity. Attempts to inhibit metalloproteinases in human diseases thus require continuing appraisal of their biological roles and cautious evaluation of potential new therapeutic opportunities.",

     "abstract": "The mammalian ADAMTS superfamily comprises 19 secreted metalloproteinases and 7 ADAMTS-like proteins, each the product of a distinct gene. Thus far, all appear to be relevant to extracellular matrix function or to cell\u2013matrix interactions. Most ADAMTS functions first emerged from analysis of spontaneous human and animal mutations and genetically engineered animals. The clinical manifestations of Mendelian disorders resulting from mutations in ADAMTS2, ADAMTS10, ADAMTS13, ADAMTS17, ADAMTSL2 and ADAMTSL4 identified essential roles for each gene, but also suggested potential cooperative functions of ADAMTS proteins. These observations were extended by analysis of spontaneous animal mutations, such as in bovine ADAMTS2, canine ADAMTS10, ADAMTS17 and ADAMTSL2 and mouse ADAMTS20. These human and animal disorders are recessive and their manifestations appear to result from a loss-of-function mechanism. Genome-wide analyses have determined an association of some ADAMTS loci such as ADAMTS9 and ADAMTS7, with specific traits and acquired disorders. Analysis of genetically engineered rodent mutations, now achieved for over half the superfamily, has provided novel biological insights and animal models for the respective human genetic disorders and suggested potential candidate genes for related human phenotypes. Engineered mouse mutants have been interbred to generate combinatorial mutants, uncovering cooperative functions of ADAMTS proteins in morphogenesis. Specific genetic models have provided crucial insights on mechanisms of osteoarthritis (OA), a common adult-onset degenerative condition. Engineered mutants will facilitate interpretation of exome variants identified in isolated birth defects and rare genetic conditions, as well as in genome-wide screens for trait and disease associations. Mammalian forward and reverse genetics, together with genome-wide analysis, together constitute a powerful force for revealing the functions of ADAMTS proteins in physiological pathways and health disorders. Their continuing use, together with genome-editing technology and the ability to generate stem cells from mutants, presents numerous opportunities for advancing basic knowledge, human disease pathways and therapy.",

Indeed, many studies have examined the neuroplastic contribution of the ADAMTSs to damage and recovery after injury and in central nervous system disease. Much of this data supports a role for the ADAMTSs in recovery and repair following spinal cord injury by stimulating axonal outgrowth after degradation of a glial scar and improving synaptic plasticity following seizure-induced neural damage in the brain. The action of the ADAMTSs in chronic diseases of the central nervous system appears to be more complex and less well-defined.

An accumulated body of evidence indicates that metastasis-supporting neovasculature should possess certain structural characteristics allowing for the process of tumor cell intravasation, an active entry of cancer cells into the vessel interior. It appears that the development of tumor vessels with lumens of a distinctive size and support of these vessels by a discontinuous pericyte coverage constitute critical microarchitectural requirements to: (a) provide accessible points for vessel wall penetration by primary tumor cells; (b) provide enough lumen space for a tumor cell or cell aggregate upon intravasation; and (c) allow for sufficient rate of blood flow to carry away intravasated cells from the primary tumor to the next, proximal or distal site.

     "abstract": "Matrikines originate from the fragmentation of extracellular matrix proteins and regulate cellular activities by interacting with specific receptors. Matrikines are implicated in inflammation, immune responses, organ development, wound repair, angiogenesis, atherosclerosis, tumor progression and metastasis due to their ability to alter cellular migration, chemotaxis, and mitogenesis. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade extracellular matrix components under normal circumstances and in disease processes. Of the 20 MMPs identified, MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-8, MMP-9, and MMP-12 have been implicated in regulating the matrikines Val-Gly-Val-Ala-Pro-Gly (elastin peptide) and proline\u2013glycine\u2013proline (PGP). Elastin peptide fragments are generated by elastolytic enzymes and have implications in atherosclerosis, neovascularization, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, skin disease, as well as tumor invasion and spread. PGP is produced through a multistep pathway that liberates the tripeptide fragment from extracellular collagen. PGP is best described for its role in neutrophil chemotaxis and is implicated in the pathogenesis of corneal ulcers and in chronic lung conditions. In chronic cigarette smoke related lung disease, the PGP pathway can become a self-propagating cycle of inflammation through cigarette-smoke mediated inhibition of leukotriene A4 hydrolase, the enzyme responsible for degrading PGP and halting acute inflammation. This review highlights the roles of MMPs in generating these important matrikines.",

     "abstract": "Dystrophin is a cytosolic protein belonging to a membrane-spanning glycoprotein complex, called dystrophin\u2013glycoprotein complex (DGC) that is expressed in many tissues, especially in skeletal muscle and in the nervous system. The DGC connects the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix and, although none of the proteins of the DGC displays kinase or phosphatase activity, it is involved in many signal transduction pathways. Mutations in some components of the DGC are linked to many forms of inherited muscular dystrophies. In particular, a mutation in the dystrophin gene, leading to a complete loss of the protein, provokes one of the most prominent muscular dystrophies, the Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which affects 1 out of 3500 newborn males. What is observed in these circumstances, is a dramatic alteration of the expression levels of a multitude of metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of extracellular Zn2+-dependent endopeptidases, in particular of MMP-2 and MMP-9, also called gelatinases. Indeed, the enzymatic activity of MMP-2 and MMP-9 on dystroglycan, an important member of the DGC, plays a significant role also in physiological processes taking place in the central and peripheral nervous system. This mini-review discusses the role of MMP-2 and MMP-9, in physiological as well as pathological processes involving members of the DGC.",

This would enable the possibility of a more upstream and effective therapeutic target. Indeed, conditions including gliomas, Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and other insults such as hypoxia/ischemia show elevated levels of EMMPRIN which correlate with MMP production. In contrast, given EMMPRIN's role in CNS homeostasis with respect to regulation of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and interactions with adhesion molecules including integrins, we need to consider that EMMPRIN may also serve important regulatory or protective functions. This review summarizes the current understanding of EMMPRIN's involvement in CNS homeostasis, its possible roles in escalating or reducing neural injury, and the mechanisms of EMMPRIN including and apart from MMP induction.",

Due to its roles, the liver is frequently exposed to various insults which can cause cell death and hepatic dysfunction. Alternatively, the liver has a remarkable ability to self-repair and regenerate after injury. Liver injury and regeneration have both been linked to complex extracellular matrix (ECM) related pathways.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are the main enzymes implicated in ECM degradation. MMPs not only remodel the ECM, but also regulate immune responses.

The most straightforward explanation for their role in cancer is that MMPs, through extracellular matrix degradation, pave the way for tumor cell invasion and metastasis. While this notion may be true for many circumstances, we now know that, depending on the context, MMPs may employ additional modes of functionality. Here, we will give an update on the function of MMPs in development and cancer, which may directly regulate signaling pathways that control tissue homeostasis and may even work in a non-proteolytic manner.

     "abstract": "Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which inhibit matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) as well as the closely related, a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) and ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTSs), were traditionally thought to control extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis through direct inhibition of MMP-dependent ECM proteolysis. This classical role for TIMPs suggests that increased TIMP levels results in ECM accumulation (or fibrosis), whereas loss of TIMPs leads to enhanced matrix proteolysis. Mice lacking TIMP family members have provided support for such a role; however, studies with these TIMP deficient mice have also demonstrated that loss of TIMPs can often be associated with an accumulation of ECM. Collectively, these studies suggest that the divergent roles of TIMPs in matrix accumulation and proteolysis, which together can be referred to as ECM turnover, are dependent on the TIMP, specific tissue, and local tissue environment (i.e. health vs. injury/disease). Ultimately, these combined factors dictate the specific metalloproteinases being regulated by a given TIMP, and it is likely the diversity of metalloproteinases and their physiological substrates that determines whether TIMPs inhibit matrix proteolysis or accumulation. In this review, we discuss the evidence for the dichotomous roles of TIMPs in ECM turnover highlighting some of the common findings between different TIMP family members. Importantly, while we now have a better understanding of the role of TIMPs in regulating ECM turnover, much remains to be determined. Data on the specific metalloproteinases inhibited by different TIMPs in vivo remains limited and must be the focus of future studies.",

MiRNA expression was studied by quantitative PCR of microdissected growth plate cartilage and binding to the 3\u2032-UTR sequences was analyzed by luciferase interaction studies. Levels of proteins encoded by target genes in cultures of miR-26a mimic- or inhibitor-transfected chondrocytes were determined by FACS or immunoblot analysis.The complementary binding sequence of miR-26a and miR-26b was found in the 3\u2032-UTR of the prehypertrophic/hypertrophic-specific genes Cd200, Col10a1 as well as Col9a1 and Ctgf.

MiR-26a could interact with the 3\u2032-UTR of Cd200 and Col10a1 in luciferase binding studies, but not with Col9a1 and Ctgf.

Interestingly, ER\u03b1 silencing in MCF-7 cells strongly induced cellular phenotypic changes accompanied by significant changes in gene and protein expression of several markers typical of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). Notably, these cells exhibited enhanced cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Moreover, ER\u03b1 suppression strongly affected the gene and protein expression of EGFR and HER2 receptor tyrosine kinases, and various extracellular matrix (ECM) effectors, including matrix metalloproteinases and their endogenous inhibitors (MMPs/TIMPs) and components of the plasminogen activation system. The action caused by E2 in MCF-7/c cells in the expression of HER2, MT1-MMP, MMP1, MMP9, uPA, tPA, and PAI-1 was abolished in MCF-7/SP10\u00a0+ cells lacking ER\u03b1. These data suggested a regulatory role for the E2/ER\u03b1 pathway in respect to the composition and activity of the extracellular proteolytic molecular network. Notably, loss of ER\u03b1 promoted breast cancer cell migration and invasion by inducing changes in the expression levels of certain matrix macromolecules (especially uPA, tPA, PAI-1) through the EGFR\u2013ERK signaling pathway.In conclusion, loss of ER\u03b1 in breast cancer cells results in a potent EMT characterized by striking changes in the expression profile of specific matrix macromolecules highlighting the potential nodal role of matrix effectors in breast cancer endocrine resistance.",

LTBP-1 is found as both short (LTBP-1S) and long (LTBP-1L) forms, which are derived through the use of separate promoters. There is controversy regarding the importance of LTBP-1L, as Ltbp1L knockout mice showed multiple cardiovascular defects but the complete null mice did not. Here, we describe a third line of Ltbp1 knockout mice generated utilizing a conditional knockout strategy that ablated expression of both L and S forms of LTBP-1. These mice show severe developmental cardiovascular abnormalities and die perinatally; thus these animals display a phenotype similar to previously reported Ltbp1L knockout mice. We reinvestigated the other \u201ccomplete\u201d knockout line and found that these mice express a splice variant of LTBP-1L and, therefore, are not complete Ltbp1 knockouts. Our results clarify the phenotypes of Ltbp1 null mice and re-emphasize the importance of LTBP-1 in vivo.",

Periostin and CCN2 are both upregulated at day 3 post-wounding in murine skin, where they regulate aspects of the proliferative phase of repair including mesenchymal cell infiltration and myofibroblast differentiation. In this study, we examined 1) the wound phenotype and expression patterns of periostin and CCN2 in non-healing skin wounds in humans and 2) the regulation of their expression in wound fibroblasts by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Chronic skin wounds had a pro-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by macrophage infiltration, TNF\u03b1 immunoreactivity, and neutrophil infiltration. Periostin, but not CCN2, was significantly suppressed in non-healing wound edge tissue at the mRNA and protein level compared with non-involved skin. In vitro, human wound edge fibroblasts populations were still able to proliferate and contract collagen gels. Compared to cells from non-involved skin, periostin and \u03b1-SMA mRNA levels increased significantly in the presence of TGF-\u03b21 in wound cells and were significantly decreased by TNF\u03b1, but not those of Col1A2 or CCN2. In the presence of both TGF-\u03b21 and TNF\u03b1, periostin and \u03b1-SMA mRNA levels were significantly reduced compared to TGF-\u03b21 treated wound cells. Effects of TGF-\u03b21 and TNF\u03b1 on gene expression were also more pronounced in wound edge cells compared to non-involved fibroblasts. We conclude that variations in the expression of periostin and CCN2, are related to an inflammatory microenvironment and the presence of TNF\u03b1 in human chronic wounds.",

A predominant role has been proposed for factor (F)XIII-A and a subsidiary role suggested for the homologous protein, transglutaminase 2. Full-length FXIII-A is an 83\u00a0kDa protransglutaminase that is present both in plasma and also in haematopoietic and connective tissue lineages. Several studies have reported expression in murine cells, including osteocytes, of a 37\u00a0kDa protein that reacts with the monoclonal anti-FXIII-A antibody AC-1A1. This protein was presumed to be a catalytically active fragment of FXIII-A-83 and to play a major role in bone deposition. We detected a 37\u00a0kDa AC-1A1 reactive protein in FXIII-A mRNA negative cell lines and in tissues from FXIII-A\u2212/\u2212 mice. By mass spectrometric sequencing of AC-1A1 immunoprecipitates, we identified this protein as transaldolase-1, and confirmed that recombinant transaldolase-1 is recognised by AC-1A1. We have also shown that bone deposition is normal in FXIII-A\u2212/\u2212.TG2\u2212/\u2212 double knockout mice, casting doubt on the role of transglutaminases in bone mineralisation. Various studies have used antibody AC-1A1 for immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence. We observe strong FXIII-A dependent staining in paraffin embedded mouse heart sections, with relatively low background in non-expressing mouse cells. In contrast, FXIII-A independent staining predominates in cultured human cells using a standard immunofluorescence procedure. Immunofluorescence is present in membrane compartments that are expected to lack transaldolase, indicating that other off-target antigens are recognised by AC-1A1. This has significant implications for studies that have used this approach to define the subcellular trafficking of FXIII-A in osteocytes.",

Fibulin-1 has also been implicated in embryonic development of the heart and neural crest-derived structures. It is an integral part of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and has been shown to bind to a multitude of ECM proteins. However, fibulin-1 was first identified as a protein purified from placental extracts that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin \u03b21. Human fibulin-1 is alternatively spliced into four different isoforms namely A\u2013D. These isoforms share a common N-terminus sequence that contains a secretion sequence but differ in their carboxy-terminal fibulin-1 module. In this report we identify a new splice variant of fibulin-1 that differs from all other fibulin-1 variants in the N-terminus sequence and has a similar carboxy-terminus sequence as fibulin-1D. This variant that we named fibulin-1D prime (fibulin-1D\u2032) lacks a secretion sequence and the anaphlatoxin region of fibulin-1 variants. The protein has an apparent molecular weight of 70.5\u00a0kDa. Herein we show that fibulin-1D\u2032 binds to the intracellular domain of integrin \u03b21 as well as to integrin \u03b15\u03b21. The protein was localized intracellularly in CHO cells transfected with a pEF4 plasmid containing full-length coding sequence of fibulin-1D\u2032. We also localized the protein in human placenta.

     "abstract": "Mechanical properties of the microenvironment regulate cell morphology and differentiation within complex organs. However, methods to restore morphogenesis and differentiation in organs in which compliance is suboptimal are poorly understood. We used mechanosensitive mouse salivary gland organ explants grown at different compliance levels together with deoxycholate extraction and immunocytochemistry of the intact, assembled matrices to examine the compliance-dependent assembly and distribution of the extracellular matrix and basement membrane in explants grown at permissive or non-permissive compliance. Extracellular matrix and basement membrane assembly were disrupted in the glands grown at low compliance compared to those grown at high compliance, correlating with defective morphogenesis and decreased myoepithelial cell differentiation. Extracellular matrix and basement membrane assembly as well as myoepithelial differentiation were restored by addition of TGF\u03b21 and by mechanical rescue, and mechanical rescue was prevented by inhibition of TGF\u03b2 signaling during the rescue. We detected a basal accumulation of active integrin \u03b21 in the differentiating myoepithelial cells that formed a continuous peripheral localization around the proacini and in clefts within active sites of morphogenesis in explants that were grown at high compliance. The pattern and levels of integrin \u03b21 activation together with myoepithelial differentiation were interrupted in explants grown at low compliance but were restored upon mechanical rescue or with application of exogenous TGF\u03b21. These data suggest that therapeutic application of TGF\u03b21 to tissues disrupted by mechanical signaling should be examined as a method to promote organ remodeling and regeneration.",

     "abstract": "It is well known that angiogenesis is linked to fibrotic processes in fibroproliferative diseases, but insights into pathophysiological processes are limited, due to lack of understanding of molecular mechanisms controlling endothelial and fibroblastic homeostasis. We demonstrate here that the matrix receptor anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1), also known as tumor endothelial marker 8 (TEM8), is an essential component of these mechanisms. Loss of TEM8 function in mice causes reduced synthesis of endothelial basement membrane components and hyperproliferative and leaky blood vessels in skin. In addition, endothelial cell alterations in mutants are almost identical to those of endothelial cells in infantile hemangioma lesions, including activated VEGF receptor signaling in endothelial cells, increased expression of the downstream targets VEGF and CXCL12, and increased numbers of macrophages and mast cells. In contrast, loss of TEM8 in fibroblasts leads to increased rates of synthesis of fiber-forming collagens, resulting in progressive fibrosis in skin and other organs. Compromised interactions between TEM8-deficient endothelial and fibroblastic cells cause dramatic reduction in the activity of the matrix-degrading enzyme MMP2. In addition to insights into mechanisms of connective tissue homeostasis, our data provide molecular explanations for vascular and connective tissue abnormalities in GAPO syndrome, caused by loss-of-function mutations in ANTXR1. Furthermore, the loss of MMP2 activity suggests that fibrotic skin abnormalities in GAPO syndrome are, in part, the consequence of pathophysiological mechanisms underlying syndromes (NAO, Torg and Winchester) with multicentric skin nodulosis and osteolysis caused by homozygous loss-of-function mutations in MMP2.",

     "abstract": "The contribution of hyaluronan-dependent pericellular matrix to TGF-\u03b21-driven induction and maintenance of myofibroblasts is not understood. Hyaluronan is an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycosaminoglycan important in cell adhesion, proliferation and migration, and is implicated in myofibroblast formation and maintenance. Reduced turnover of hyaluronan has been linked to differentiation of myofibroblasts and potentiation of lung fibrosis. Fibronectin is a fibril forming adhesive glycoprotein that is also upregulated following induction with TGF-\u03b21. Although they are known to bind each other, the interplay between hyaluronan and fibronectin in the pericellular matrix during myofibroblast induction and matrix assembly is not clear. This study addresses the role of hyaluronan and its interaction with fibrillar matrix components during myofibroblast formation. Hyaluronan and fibronectin were increased and co-localized in the ECM following myofibroblast induction by TGF-\u03b21. Inhibition of hyaluronan synthesis in TGF-\u03b21-induced lung myofibroblasts over a 4\u00a0day period with 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MU) further enhanced myofibroblast morphology, caused increased deposition of fibronectin and type I collagen in the ECM, and increased expression of alpha-smooth muscle actin and hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2) mRNA. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides or hyaluronidase treatment, which more effectively disrupted the pericellular matrix, had similar effects. CD44 and \u03b21 integrins co-localized in the cell membrane and along some stress fibers. However, CD44 and hyaluronan were specifically excluded from focal adhesions, and associated primarily with cortical actin. Time-lapse imaging of the immediate effects of hyaluronidase digestion showed that hyaluronan matrix primarily mediates attachment of membrane and cortical actin between focal contacts, suggesting that surface adhesion through hyaluronan and CD44 is distinct from focal adhesion through \u03b21 integrins and fibronectin. Fluorescein-labeled hyaluronan bound regularly along fibronectin fibers and co-localized more with \u03b21 integrin and less with CD44. Therefore, the hyaluronan matrix can interfere with the assembly of fibrillar ECM components, and this interplay regulates the degree of myofibroblast formation. These data also suggest that adhesion through hyaluronan matrix impacts cytoskeletal organization, and is potentially part of a clutch mechanism that regulates stick and slip of myofibroblasts by affecting the adhesion to and organization of fibronectin and collagen.",

Since the amounts of \u03b1-DG and \u03b2-DG at the cell surface decrease when gelatinases are up-regulated, we investigated the degradation of \u03b1-DG subunit by MMP-2. Present data show, for the first time, that the proteolysis of \u03b1-DG indeed occurs on a native glycosylated molecule enriched from rabbit skeletal muscle. In order to characterize the \u03b1-DG portion, which is more prone to cleavage by MMP-2, we performed different degradations on tailored recombinant domains of \u03b1-DG spanning the whole subunit. The overall bulk of results casts light on a relevant susceptibility of the \u03b1-DG to MMP-2 degradation with particular reference to its C-terminal domain, thus opening a new scenario on the role of gelatinases (in particular of MMP-2) in the degradation of this glycoprotein complex, taking place in the course of pathological processes.",

Jurkat cells, whose \u03b14 integrins are inherently activated, adhered to different preparations of OPN in the presence of Mn2\u00a0+: the EC50 of adhesion was not affected by phosphorylation or glycosylation status. Thrombin cleavage of OPN at the C-terminus of the \u03b14 integrin-binding site also did not affect binding affinity.

     "abstract": "The development of atherosclerosis involves phenotypic changes among vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) that correlate with stiffening and remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). VSMCs are highly sensitive to the composition and mechanical state of the surrounding ECM, and ECM remodeling during atherosclerosis likely contributes to pathology. We hypothesized that ECM mechanics and biochemistry are interdependent in their regulation of VSMC behavior and investigated the effect of ligand presentation on certain stiffness-mediated processes. Our findings demonstrate that substrate stiffening is not a unidirectional stimulus\u2014instead, the influence of mechanics on cell behavior is highly conditioned on ligand biochemistry. This \u201cstiffness-by-ligand\u201d effect was evident for VSMC adhesion, spreading, cytoskeletal polymerization, and focal adhesion assembly, where VSMCs cultured on fibronectin (Fn)-modified substrates showed an augmented response to increasing stiffness, whereas cells on laminin (Ln) substrates showed a dampened response. By contrast, cells on Fn substrates showed a decrease in myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and elongation with increasing stiffness, whereas Ln supported an increase in MLC phosphorylation and no change in cell shape with increasing stiffness. Taken together, these findings show that identical cell populations exhibit opposing responses to substrate stiffening depending on ECM presentation. Our results also suggest that the shift in VSMC phenotype in a developing atherosclerotic lesion is jointly regulated by stromal mechanics and biochemistry. This study highlights the complex influence of the blood vessel wall microenvironment on VSMC phenotype and provides insight into how cells may integrate ECM biochemistry and mechanics during normal and pathological tissue function.",

To study EMILIN1 and EMILIN2 interaction and assembly we have applied qualitative and quantitative two hybrid systems using constructs corresponding to the gC1q and EMI domains. The identified interactions were further confirmed in yeast extracts of co-transfected cells followed by co-immunoprecipitation. The data indicated that gC1q domains are able to self-interact as well as to interact one each other and with the EMI domains, but no self interactions were detected between the EMI domains. Furthermore EMILINs interactions were studied in 293-EBNA cells co-transfected with full lenght EMILIN1 and EMILIN2 constructs. Specific antibodies were able to co-immunoprecipitate EMILINs, indicating that also full-lenght proteins can give rise to non-covalent homo- and hetero-multimers even if reduced and alkylated before mixing. Immunofluorescence analysis on mouse cell cultures and tissues sections with specific antibodies showed co-distribution of EMILIN1 and EMILIN2. Thus, we can hypothesize that EMILINs multimers are formed by head-to-tail interaction between C-terminal and N-terminal domains of EMILIN1 and/or EMILIN2 but also by tail-to-tail interaction between gC1q domains. These multiple interactions may regulate homo-typic and/or hetero-typic linear and eventually lateral branching assemblies of EMILIN1 and EMILIN2 in tissues.",

Post-translational modifications of ECM proteins are thus appearing as mechanisms, which contribute to tissue dysfunction in chronic kidney disease, in diabetes and in various inflammatory diseases. In chronic renal failure, carbamylation could lead to kidney fibrosis. In diabetes, high glucose levels lead to non-enzymatic glycation and cross-linking of collagens, which contribute to tissue stiffening with consequences for cardiovascular and renal functions. In inflammatory diseases, citrullination deiminates arginine residues with possible consequences for integrin-mediated cell adhesion to RGD- and GFOGER sequences in ECM proteins. Citrullination of fibronectin was in one study suggested to affect cell adhesion by modifying the heparin-binding site and not the RGD site. In a recent publication citrullination of GFOGER sequences in collagen II was demonstrated to selectively affect \u03b110\u03b21 and \u03b111\u03b21 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to collagen II, with consequences for synovial fibroblast and stem cell adhesion and migration.

     "abstract": "Degeneration of the intervertebral disc is characterized by changes in proteoglycan status, loss of bound water molecules, decreased tissue osmotic pressure and a resulting mechanical failure of the disc. A similar spectrum of changes is evident in osteoarthritic articular cartilage. When healthy, resident cells in these skeletal tissues respond to applied mechanical loads by regulating their own osmotic state and the hydration of the extracellular matrix. The transcription factor Tonicity-Responsive Enhancer Binding Protein (TonEBP or NFAT5) is known to mediate the osmoadaptive response in these and other tissues. While the molecular basis of how osmotic loading controls matrix homeostasis is not completely understood, TonEBP regulates the expression of aggrecan and \u03b21,3-glucoronosyltransferase in nucleus pulposus cells, in addition to targets that allow for survival under hypertonic stress. Moreover, in chondrocytes, TonEBP controls expression of several collagen subtypes and Sox9, a master regulator of aggrecan and collagen II expression. Thus, TonEBP-mediated regulation of the matrix composition allows disc cells and chondrocytes to modify the extracellular osmotic state itself. On the other hand, TonEBP in immune cells induces expression of TNF-\u03b1, \u0399L-6 and MCP-1, pro-inflammatory molecules closely linked to matrix catabolism and pathogenesis of both disc degeneration and osteoarthritis, warranting investigations of this aspect of TonEBP function in skeletal cells. In summary, the TonEBP system, through its effects on extracellular matrix and osmoregulatory genes can be viewed primarily as a protective or homeostatic response to physiological loading.",

Initial experiments using the 3D neutral hydrogel were conducted in static isotonic culture with ionic and non-ionic osmolytes added to the culture medium. Tissue production by bovine chondrocytes with non-ionic osmolytes was 1.9-fold greater than with ionic osmolytes, suggesting that the ionic nature of the osmolyte is an important regulator of tissue production. To investigate fixed negative charges, a 3D culture system containing encapsulated chondrocytes was employed based on a synthetic and neutral hydrogel platform within which negatively charged chondroitin sulfate was incorporated in a controlled manner. Incorporation of negative charges did not affect the mechanical properties of the hydrogel; however, intracellular ion concentration was elevated from the culture medium (330\u00a0mOsm) and estimated to be similar to that in ~\u00a0400\u00a0mOsm culture medium. With dynamic loading, GAG synthesis decreased by 26% in neutral hydrogels cultured in 400\u00a0mOsm medium, and increased by 26% in charged gels cultured in 330\u00a0mOsm. Treatment of chondrocyte-seeded hydrogels with the Ca2\u00a0+ chelator BAPTA-AM decreased GAG synthesis by 32\u201346% and was similar among all conditions, suggesting multiple roles for Ca2\u00a0+ mediated tissue production including with ionic osmolytes.

     "abstract": "MAGP2 is a small extracellular protein with both tumor angiogenesis and cell signaling activity. MAGP2 was originally isolated biochemically from microfibril-rich connective tissue. The localization of MAGP2 to microfibrils has been confirmed by both immunohistochemistry and immunogold electron microscopy. Whether MAGP2 binding to microfibrils is regulated post-translationally is still unclear, however, and a better understanding of this process would be instructive to understanding the angiogenesis and signaling functions ascribed to MAGP2. Here we show via immunofluorescence studies that the T3 cell line, derived from ovarian mouse tumor cells, produces abundant fibrillin-2 microfibrils to which MAGP2 can bind. Co-localization of MAGP2 and fibrillin-2 can be detected either when MAGP2 is overexpressed in, or exogenously introduced to, the cells. As expected, matrix association of MAGP2 required its conserved Matrix Binding Domain. Matrix association was positively regulated by proprotein convertase (PC) cleavage of MAGP2; mutation of the MAGP2 PC consensus site reduced the amount of matrix-associated MAGP2. Deletion analysis of the C-terminal 20-amino acid domain that is defined by the PC cleavage site suggests that this domain also positively modulates matrix localization of MAGP2, in a manner that requires the amino-terminal half of the protein. Together, our data indicate that matrix localization of MAGP2 by its Matrix Binding Domain is promoted by PC cleavage and the presence of its C-terminal 20 amino acids.",

In the present study, we investigated the distribution of ECM molecules along the surface-to-bone axis, using quantitative non-targeted as well as targeted proteomics.\\In a discovery approach, iTRAQ mass spectrometry was used to identify all extractable ECM proteins in the different layers of a human lateral tibial plateau full thickness cartilage sample. A targeted MRM mass spectrometry approach was then applied to verify these findings and to extend the analysis to four medial tibial plateau samples.In the lateral tibial plateau sample, the unique distribution patterns of 70 ECM proteins were identified, revealing groups of proteins with a preferential distribution to the superficial, intermediate or deep regions of articular cartilage. The detailed analysis of selected 29 proteins confirmed these findings and revealed similar distribution patterns in the four medial tibial plateau samples.The results of this study allow, for the first time, an overview of the zonal distribution of a broad range of cartilage ECM proteins and open up further investigations of the functional roles of matrix proteins in the different zones of articular cartilage in health and disease.",

     "abstract": "Whisker follicles have multiple stem cell niches, including epidermal stem cells in the bulge as well as neural crest-derived stem cells and mast cell progenitors in the trabecular region. The neural crest-derived stem cells are a pool of melanocyte precursors. Previously, we found that the extracellular matrix glycoproteins tenascin-C and tenascin-W are expressed near CD34-positive cells in the trabecular stem cell niche of mouse whisker follicles. Here, we analyzed whiskers from tenascin-C knockout mice and found intrafollicular adipocytes and supernumerary mast cells. As Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling promotes melanogenesis and suppresses the differentiation of adipocytes and mast cells, we analyzed \u03b2-catenin subcellular localization in the trabecular niche. We found cytoplasmic and nuclear \u03b2-catenin in wild-type mice reflecting active Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, whereas \u03b2-catenin in tenascin-C knockout mice was mostly cell membrane-associated and thus transcriptionally inactive. Furthermore, cells expressing the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin target gene cyclin D1 were enriched in the CD34-positive niches of wild-type compared to tenascin-C knockout mice. We then tested the effects of tenascins on this signaling pathway. We found that tenascin-C and tenascin-W can be co-precipitated with Wnt3a. In vitro, substrate bound tenascins promoted \u03b2-catenin-mediated transcription in the presence of Wnt3a, presumably due to the sequestration and concentration of Wnt3a near the cell surface. We conclude that the presence of tenascin-C in whiskers assures active Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the niche thereby maintaining the stem cell pool and suppressing aberrant differentiation, while in the knockout mice with reduced Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, stem cells from the trabecular niche can differentiate into ectopic adipocytes and mast cells.",

Its heterogeneity due to various acetylation and sulfation patterns endows a multitude of functions. In animal tissues, HS interacts with a wide range of proteins to mediate numerous biological activities; given its multiple roles in inflammation processes, characterization of HS in human serum has significant potential for elucidating disease mechanisms. Historically, investigation of HS was limited by its low concentration in human serum, together with the complexity of the serum matrix. In this study, we used a modified mass spectrometry method to examine HS disaccharide profiles in the serum of 50 women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and compared our results to 51 sera from healthy women. Using various purification methods and online LC\u2013MS/MS, we discovered statistically significant differences in the sulfation and acetylation patterns between populations. Since early diagnosis of RA is considered important in decelerating the disease's progression, identification of specific biomolecule characterizations may provide crucial information towards developing new therapies for suppressing the disease in its early stages. This is the first report of potential glycosaminoglycan biomarkers for RA found in human sera, while acknowledging the obvious fact that a larger population set, and more stringent collection parameters, will need to be investigated in the future.",

     "abstract": "Early wound healing is associated with fibroblasts assembling a provisional fibronectin-rich extracellular matrix (ECM), which is subsequently remodeled and interlaced by type I collagen. This exposes fibroblasts to time-variant sets of matrices during different stages of wound healing. Our goal was thus to gain insight into the ECM-driven functional regulation of human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) being either anchored to a fibronectin (Fn) or to a collagen-decorated matrix, in the absence or presence of cyclic mechanical strain. While the cells reoriented in response to the onset of uniaxial cyclic strain, cells assembled exogenously added Fn with a preferential Fn-fiber alignment along their new orientation. Exposure of HFFs to exogenous Fn resulted in an increase in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression levels, i.e. MMP-15 (RT-qPCR), and MMP-9 activity (zymography), while subsequent exposure to collagen slightly reduced MMP-15 expression and MMP-9 activity compared to Fn-exposure alone. Cyclic strain upregulated Fn fibrillogenesis and actin stress fiber formation, but had comparatively little effect on MMP activity. We thus propose that the appearance of collagen might start to steer HFFs towards homeostasis, as it decreased both MMP secretion and the tension of Fn matrix fibrils as assessed by Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer. These results suggest that HFFs might have a high ECM remodeling or repair capacity in contact with Fn alone (early event), which is reduced in the presence of Col1 (later event), thereby down-tuning HFF activity, a processes which would be required in a tissue repair process to finally reach tissue homeostasis.",

Together, these tissues give each joint its unique shape, organization and biomechanical function. Articular cartilage itself is rather complex and organized in distinct zones, including the superficial zone that produces lubricants and contains stem/progenitor cells. For many years there has been great interest in deciphering the mechanisms by which the joints form and come to acquire such unique structural features and diversity. Decades ago, classic embryologists discovered that the first overt sign of joint formation at each prescribed limb site was the appearance of a dense and compact population of mesenchymal cells collectively called the interzone. Work carried out since then by several groups has provided evidence that the interzone cells actively participate in joint tissue formation over developmental time. This minireview provides a succinct but comprehensive description of the many important recent advances in this field of research. These include studies using various conditional reporter mice to genetically trace and track the origin, fate and possible function of joint progenitor cells; studies on the involvement and roles in signaling pathways and transcription factors in joint cell determination and functioning; and studies using advanced methods of gene expression analyses to uncover novel genetic determinants of joint formation and diversity. The overall advances are impressive, and the findings are not only of obvious interest and importance but also have major implications in the conception of future translational medicine tools to repair and regenerate defective, overused or aging joints.",

While the PCM was first observed nearly a century ago, its role is still under investigation. In support of early hypotheses regarding its function, increasing evidence indicates that the PCM serves as a transducer of biochemical and biomechanical signals to the chondrocyte. Work over the past two decades has established that the PCM in adult tissue is defined biochemically by several molecular components, including type VI collagen and perlecan. On the other hand, the biomechanical properties of this structure have only recently been measured. Techniques such as micropipette aspiration, in situ imaging, computational modeling, and atomic force microscopy have determined that the PCM exhibits distinct mechanical properties as compared to the ECM, and that these properties are influenced by specific PCM components as well as disease state. Importantly, the unique relationships among the mechanical properties of the chondrocyte, PCM, and ECM in different zones of cartilage suggest that this region significantly influences the stress\u2013strain environment of the chondrocyte. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the measurement of PCM mechanical properties and structure that further increase our understanding of PCM function. Taken together, these studies suggest that the PCM plays a critical role in controlling the mechanical environment and mechanobiology of cells in cartilage and other cartilaginous tissues, such as the meniscus or intervertebral disc.",

     "abstract": "No single processing technique is capable of optimally preserving each and all of the structural entities of cartilaginous tissue. Hence, the choice of methodology must necessarily be governed by the nature of the component that is targeted for analysis, for example, fibrillar collagens or proteoglycans within the extracellular matrix, or the chondrocytes themselves.This article affords an insight into the pitfalls that are to be encountered when implementing the available techniques and how best to circumvent them.Adult articular cartilage is taken as a representative pars pro toto of the different bodily types. In mammals, this layer of tissue is a component of the synovial joints, wherein it fulfills crucial and diverse biomechanical functions. The biomechanical functions of articular cartilage have their structural and molecular correlates. During the natural course of postnatal development and after the onset of pathological disease processes, such as osteoarthritis, the tissue undergoes structural changes which are intimately reflected in biomechanical modulations. The fine structural intricacies that subserve the changes in tissue function can be accurately assessed only if they are faithfully preserved at the molecular level. For this reason, a careful consideration of the tissue-processing technique is indispensable. Since, as aforementioned, no single methodological tool is capable of optimally preserving all constituents, the approach must be pre-selected with a targeted structure in view. Guidance in this choice is offered.",

Insufficient number and activity of resident mesenchymal (connective tissue) progenitors is likely one of the underlying reasons. Chondroprogenitors reside not only in the superficial zone of articular cartilage but also in other zones of articular cartilage and in the neighboring tissues, including perichondrium (groove of Ranvier), synovium and fat pad. These cells may respond to injury and contribute to articular cartilage healing. In addition, marrow stromal cells can migrate through subchondral bone when articular cartilage is damaged. We should develop drugs and methods that correctly stimulate resident progenitors for improvement of repair and inhibition of degenerative changes in articular cartilage.",

MRL/MpJ mouse strain initially identified to heal full-thickness ear wounds now represents a classical example of mammalian wound regeneration since it can heal a spectrum of injuries such as skin and cardiac wounds, nerve injuries and knee articular cartilage lesions. In addition to MRL/MpJ, a few other mouse strains such as LG/J (a parent of MRL/MpJ) and LGXSM-6 (arising from an intercross between LG/J and SM/J mouse strains) have now been recognized to possess regenerative/healing abilities for articular cartilage and ear wound injuries that are similar, if not superior, to MRL/MpJ mice. While some mechanisms underlying regenerative potential have been begun to emerge, a complete set of biological processes and pathways still needs to be elucidated. Using a panel of healer and non-healer mouse strains, our recent work has provided some insights into the genes that could potentially be associated with healing potential.

     "abstract": "Our friend and colleague, Dr. Dick Heineg\u00e5rd, contributed greatly to the understanding of joint tissue biochemistry, the discovery and validation of arthritis-related biomarkers and the establishment of methodology for proteomic studies in osteoarthritis (OA). To date, discovery of OA-related biomarkers has focused on cartilage, synovial fluid and serum. Methods, such as affinity depletion and hyaluronidase treatment have facilitated proteomics discovery research from these sources. Osteoarthritis usually involves multiple joints; this characteristic makes it easier to detect OA with a systemic biomarker but makes it hard to delineate abnormalities of individual affected joints. Although the abundance of cartilage proteins in urine may generally be lower than other tissue/sample sources, the protein composition of urine is much less complex and its collection is non-invasive thereby facilitating the development of patient friendly biomarkers. To date however, relatively few proteomics studies have been conducted in OA urine. Proteomics strategies have identified many proteins that may relate to pathological mechanisms of OA. Further targeted approaches to validate the role of these proteins in OA are needed. Herein we summarize recent proteomic studies related to joint tissues and the cohorts used; a clear understanding of the cohorts is important for this work as we expect that the decisive discoveries of OA-related biomarkers rely on comprehensive phenotyping of healthy non-OA and OA subjects. Besides the common phenotyping criteria that include, gender, age, and body mass index (BMI), it is essential to collect data on symptoms and signs of OA outside the index joints and to bolster this with objective imaging data whenever possible to gain the most precise appreciation of the total burden of disease. Proteomic studies on systemic biospecimens, such as serum and urine, rely on comprehensive phenotyping data to unravel the true meaning of the proteomic results.",

Various imaging modalities and biochemical techniques have been used to assess the changes in cartilage tissue but lack adequate sensitivity, or in the case of biochemical techniques, result in destruction of the sample. Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy has shown promise for the study of cartilage composition. In the current study NIR spectroscopy was used to identify the contributions of individual components of cartilage in the NIR spectra by assessment of the major cartilage components, collagen and chondroitin sulfate, in pure component mixtures. The NIR spectra were obtained using homogenous pellets made by dilution with potassium bromide. A partial least squares (PLS) model was calculated to predict composition in bovine cartilage samples. Characteristic absorbance peaks between 4000 and 5000\u00a0cm\u22121 could be attributed to components of cartilage, i.e. collagen and chondroitin sulfate. Prediction of the amount of collagen and chondroitin sulfate in tissues was possible within 8% (w/dw) of values obtained by gold standard biochemical assessment. These results support the use of NIR spectroscopy for in vitro and in vivo applications to assess matrix composition of cartilage tissues, especially when tissue destruction should be avoided.",

The structures of the insoluble materials and human aortic elastin were investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, all samples were digested with enzymes of different specificities, and the resultant peptide mixtures were characterized by ESI mass spectrometry and MALDI mass spectrometry. The MS2 data was used to sequence linear peptides, and cross-linked species were analyzed with the recently developed software PolyLinX. This enabled the identification of two intramolecularly cross-linked peptides containing allysine aldols in the two constructs. The presence of the tetrafunctional cross-link desmosine was shown for all analyzed materials and its quantification revealed that the cross-linking degree of the two in vitro cross-linked materials was significantly lower than that of native elastin. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed, based on molecular species identified in the samples, to follow the formation of elastin cross-links. The results provide evidence for the significance of the GVGTP hinge region of domain 23 for the formation of elastin cross-links. Overall, this work provides important insight into structural similarities and differences between elastin-like constructs and native elastin.

     "abstract": "Sensory and sympathetic nerve fibers (SNF) innervate bone and epiphyseal growth plate. The role of neuronal signals for proper endochondral ossification during skeletal growth is mostly unknown. Here, we investigated the impact of the absence of sensory neurotransmitter substance P (SP) and the removal of SNF on callus differentiation, a model for endochondral ossification in adult animals, and on bone formation.In order to generate callus, tibia fractures were set in the left hind leg of wild type (WT), tachykinin 1-deficient (Tac1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212) mice (no SP) and animals without SNF. Locomotion was tested in healthy animals and touch sensibility was determined early after fracture. Callus tissue was prepared for immunofluorescence staining for SP, neurokinin1-receptor (NK1R), tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) and adrenergic receptors \u03b11, \u03b12 and \u03b22. At the fracture site, osteoclasts were stained for TRAP, osteoblasts were stained for RUNX2, and histomorphometric analysis of callus tissue composition was performed. Primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM), osteoclasts, and osteoblasts were tested for differentiation, activity, proliferation and apoptosis in vitro. Femoral fractures were set in the left hind leg of all the three groups for mechanical testing and \u03bcCT-analysis.Callus cells stained positive for SP, NK1R, \u03b11d- and \u03b12b adrenoceptors and remained \u03b22-adrenoceptor and TH-negative. Absence of SP and SNF did not change the general locomotion but reduces touch sensitivity after fracture. In mice without SNF, we detected more mesenchymal callus tissue and less cartilaginous tissue 5\u00a0days after fracture. At day 13 past fracture, we observed a decrease of the area covered by hypertrophic chondrocytes in Tac1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice and mice without SNF, a lower number of osteoblasts in Tac1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice and an increase of osteoclasts in mineralized callus tissue in mice without SNF. Apoptosis rate and activity of osteoclasts and osteoblasts isolated from Tac1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 and sympathectomized mice were partly altered in vitro. Mechanical testing of fractured- and contralateral legs 21\u00a0days after fracture, revealed an overall reduced mechanical bone quality in Tac1\u00a0\u2212/\u2212 mice and mice without SNF. \u03bcCT-analysis revealed clear structural alteration in contralateral and fractured legs proximal of the fracture site with respect to trabecular parameters, bone mass and connectivity density. Notably, structural parameters are altered in fractured legs when related to unfractured legs in WT but not in mice without SP and SNF.The absence of SP and SNF reduces pain sensitivity and mechanical stability of the bone in general. The micro-architecture of the bone is profoundly impaired in the absence of intact SNF with a less drastic effect in SP-deficient mice. Both sympathetic and sensory neurotransmitters are indispensable for proper callus differentiation. Importantly, the absence of SP reduces bone formation rate whereas the absence of SNF induces bone resorption rate. Notably, fracture chondrocytes produce SP and its receptor NK1 and are positive for \u03b1-adrenoceptors indicating an endogenous callus signaling loop. We propose that sensory and sympathetic neurotransmitters have crucial trophic effects which are essential for proper bone formation in addition to their classical neurological actions.",

We used an established, quantifiable model of endothelial cell (EC) sprout initiation where ECs were tested for invasion in low (1\u00a0mg/mL) and high density (5\u00a0mg/mL) 3D collagen matrices. Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) alone, or S1P combined with stromal derived factor-1\u03b1 (SDF) and phorbol ester (TPA), elicited robust sprouting responses. The ability of these factors to stimulate sprouting was more effective in higher density collagen matrices. S1P stimulation resulted in a significant increase in invasion distance, and with the exception of treatment groups containing phorbol ester, invasion distance was longer in 1\u00a0mg/mL compared to 5\u00a0mg/mL collagen matrices. Closer examination of cell morphology revealed that increasing matrix density and supplementing with SDF and TPA enhanced the formation of multicellular structures more closely resembling capillaries. TPA enhanced the frequency and size of lumen formation and correlated with a robust increase in phosphorylation of p42/p44 Erk kinase, while S1P and SDF did not. Also, a higher number of significantly longer extended processes formed in 5\u00a0mg/mL compared to 1\u00a0mg/mL collagen matrices. Because collagen matrices at higher density have been reported to be stiffer, we tested for changes in the mechanosensitive protein, zyxin. Interestingly, zyxin phosphorylation levels inversely correlated with matrix density, while levels of total zyxin did not change significantly. Immunofluorescence and localization studies revealed that total zyxin was distributed evenly throughout invading structures, while phosphorylated zyxin was slightly more intense in extended peripheral processes. Silencing zyxin expression increased extended process length and number of processes, while increasing zyxin levels decreased extended process length. Altogether these data indicate that ECs integrate signals from multiple exogenous factors, including changes in matrix density, to accomplish successful sprouting responses. We show here for the first time that zyxin limited the formation and extension of fine peripheral processes used by ECs for matrix interrogation, providing a molecular explanation for altered EC responses to high and low density collagen matrices.",

The hypomaturation enamel phenotype has been described for mutations involved in the later stage of enamel formation, including Klk4, Mmp20, C4orf26, and Wdr72. Using a candidate gene approach we discovered a novel Wdr72 human mutation in association with AI to be a 5-base pair deletion (c.806_810delGGCAG; p.G255VfsX294). To gain insight into the function of WDR72, we used computer modeling of the full-length human WDR72 protein structure and found that the predicted N-terminal sequence forms two beta-propeller folds with an alpha-solenoid tail at the C-terminus. This domain iteration is characteristic of vesicle coat proteins, such as beta\u2032-COP, suggesting a role for WDR72 in the formation of membrane deformation complexes to regulate intracellular trafficking. Our Wdr72 knockout mouse model (Wdr72\u2212/\u2212), containing a LacZ reporter knock-in, exhibited hypomineralized enamel similar to the AI phenotype observed in humans with Wdr72 mutations. MicroCT scans of Wdr72\u2212/\u2212 mandibles affirmed the hypomineralized enamel phenotype occurring at the onset of the maturation stage. H&E staining revealed a shortened height phenotype in the Wdr72\u2212/\u2212 ameloblasts with retained proteins in the enamel matrix during maturation stage. H+/Cl\u2212 exchange transporter 5 (CLC5), an early endosome acidifier, was co-localized with WDR72 in maturation-stage ameloblasts and decreased in Wdr72\u2212/\u2212 maturation-stage ameloblasts. There were no obvious differences in RAB4A and LAMP1 immunostaining of Wdr72\u2212/\u2212 mice as compared to wildtype controls. Moreover, Wdr72\u2212/\u2212 ameloblasts had reduced amelogenin immunoreactivity, suggesting defects in amelogenin fragment resorption from the matrix. These data demonstrate that WDR72 has a major role in enamel mineralization, most notably during the maturation stage, and suggest a function involving endocytic vesicle trafficking, possibly in the removal of amelogenin proteins.",

     "abstract": "This study investigated changes in collagen fibril architecture and the sulphation status of keratan sulphate (KS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) epitopes from central to peripheral corneal regions. Freshly excised adult bovine corneal tissue was examined as a function of radial position from the centre of the cornea outwards. Corneal thickness, tissue hydration, hydroxyproline content, and the total amount of sulphated GAG were all measured. High and low-sulphated epitopes of keratan sulphate were studied by immunohistochemistry and quantified by ELISA. Chondroitin sulphate (CS) and dermatan sulphate (DS) distributions were observed by immunohistochemistry following specific enzyme digestions. Electron microscopy and X-ray fibre diffraction were used to ascertain collagen fibril architecture. The bovine cornea was 1021\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.42\u00a0\u03bcm thick at its outer periphery, defined as 9\u201312\u00a0mm from the corneal centre, compared to 844\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.10\u00a0\u03bcm at the centre. The outer periphery of the cornea was marginally, but not significantly, more hydrated than the centre (H\u00a0=\u00a04.3 vs. H\u00a0=\u00a03.7), and was more abundant in hydroxyproline (0.12 vs. 0.06\u00a0mg/mg dry weight of cornea). DMMB assays indicated no change in the total amount of sulphated GAG across the cornea. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of both high- and low-sulphated epitopes of KS, as well as DS, throughout the cornea, and CS only in the peripheral cornea before the limbus. Quantification by ELISA, disclosed that although both high- and low-sulphated KS remained constant throughout stromal depth at different radial positions, high-sulphated epitopes remained constant from the corneal centre to outer-periphery, whereas low-sulphated epitopes increased significantly. Both small angle X-ray diffraction and TEM analysis revealed that collagen fibril diameter remained relatively constant until the outer periphery was reached, after which fibrils became more widely spaced (from small angle x-ray diffraction analysis) and of larger diameter as they approached the sclera. Depth-profiled synchrotron microbeam analyses showed that, at different radial positions from the corneal centre outwards, fibril diameter was greater superficially than in deeper stromal regions. The interfibrillar spacing was also higher at mid-depth in the stroma than it was in anterior and posterior stromal regions. Collagen fibrils in the bovine cornea exhibited a fairly consistent spacing and diameter from the corneal centre to the 12\u00a0mm radial position, after which a significant increase was seen. While the constancy of the overall sulphation levels of proteoglycans in the cornea may correlate with the fibrillar architecture, there was no correlation between the latter and the distribution of low-sulphated KS.",

     "abstract": "Chondroadherin (CHAD), a class IV small leucine rich proteoglycan/protein (SLRP), was hypothesized to play important roles in regulating chondrocyte signaling and cartilage homeostasis. However, its roles in cartilage development and function are not well understood, and no major osteoarthritis-like phenotype was found in the murine model with CHAD genetically deleted (CHAD\u2212/\u2212). In this study, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanoindentation to quantify the effects of CHAD deletion on changes in the biomechanical function of murine cartilage. In comparison to wild-type (WT) mice, CHAD-deletion resulted in a significant \u2248\u00a070\u201380% reduction in the indentation modulus, Eind, of the superficial zone knee cartilage of 11\u00a0weeks, 4\u00a0months and 1\u00a0year old animals. This mechanical phenotype correlates well with observed increases in the heterogeneity collagen fibril diameters in the surface zone. The results suggest that CHAD mainly plays a major role in regulating the formation of the collagen fibrillar network during the early skeletal development. In contrast, CHAD-deletion had no appreciable effects on the indentation mechanics of middle/deep zone cartilage, likely due to the dominating role of aggrecan in the middle/deep zone. The presence of significant rate dependence of the indentation stiffness in both WT and CHAD\u2212/\u2212 knee cartilage suggested the importance of both fluid flow induced poroelasticity and intrinsic viscoelasticity in murine cartilage biomechanical properties. Furthermore, the marked differences in the nanomechanical behavior of WT versus CHAD\u2212/\u2212 cartilage contrasted sharply with the relative absence of overt differences in histological appearance. These observations highlight the sensitivity of nanomechanical tools in evaluating structural and mechanical phenotypes in transgenic mice.",

Concomitantly with the tight skin phenotype at two weeks of age, Tsk2/+ mice demonstrate increased levels of total transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) and excessive accumulation of dermal elastic fibers. The increase in elastic fibers is not responsible for tight skin, however, because Tsk2/+ mice genetically engineered to lack skin elastic fibers nevertheless have tight skin and fibrosis.

We have identified a novel interaction of the members of the TSP gene family with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1). This association is robust since it is preserved in Triton X-100, can be detected with multiple anti-TSP-1 and anti-STIM1 antibodies, and is detected in a wide range of cell types. We have also found that STIM1 co-immunoprecipitates with TSP-4 and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), and that a recombinant version of the N-terminal domain of STIM1 binds to the signature domain of TSP-1 and COMP. The association of the TSPs with STIM1 is observed in both the presence and absence of calcium indicating that the calcium-dependent conformation of the signature domain of TSPs is not required for binding. Thus, this interaction could occur in the ER under conditions of normal or low calcium concentration. Furthermore, we observed that the expression of COMP in HEK 293 cells decreases STIM1-mediated calcium release activated calcium (CRAC) channel currents and increases arachidonic acid calcium (ARC) channel currents. These data indicate that the TSPs regulate STIM1 function and participate in the reciprocal regulation of two channels that mediate calcium entry into the cell.",

     "abstract": "More than 2.5 million Americans suffer from burn injuries annually, and burn management is a major public health problem. Treatments have been developed to manage wound injuries employing skin grafts, various dressings and topical and systemic agents. However, these often achieve limited degrees of success. We previously reported that targeting the interaction of thrombospondin-1 with its signaling receptor CD47 or deletion of the genes encoding either of these proteins in mice improves recovery from soft tissue ischemic injuries as well as tissue injuries caused by ionizing radiation. We now demonstrate that the absence of CD47 improves the rate of wound closure for a focal dermal second-degree thermal injury, whereas lack of thrombospondin-1 initially delays wound closure compared to healing in wild type mice. Doppler analysis of the wounded area showed increased blood flow in both CD47 and thrombospondin-1 null mice. Accelerated wound closure in the CD47 null mice was associated with increased fibrosis as demonstrated by a 4-fold increase in collagen fraction. Wound tissue of CD47 null mice showed increased thrombospondin-1 mRNA and protein expression and TGF-\u03b21 mRNA levels. Activation of latent TGF-\u03b21 was increased in thermally injured CD47-null tissue as assessed by phosphorylation of the TGF-\u03b21 receptor-regulated transcription factors SMAD-2 and -3. Overall these results indicate that targeting CD47 may improve the speed of healing thermal injuries, but some level of CD47 expression may be required to limit the long term TGF-\u03b21-dependent fibrosis of these wounds.",

TSP-4, one of the 5 TSP family members, is expressed abundantly in tendon and muscle. We have examined the effect of TSP-4 deficiency on tendon collagen and skeletal muscle morphology and function.In Thbs4\u2212/\u2212 mice, tendon collagen fibrils are significantly larger than in wild-type mice, and there is no compensatory over-expression of TSP-3 and TSP-5, the two TSPs most highly homologous to TSP-4, in the deficient mice. TSP-4 is expressed in skeletal muscle, and higher levels of TSP-4 protein are associated with the microvasculature of red skeletal muscle with high oxidative metabolism. Lack of TSP-4 in medial soleus, red skeletal muscle with predominant oxidative metabolism, is associated with decreased levels of several specific glycosaminoglycan modifications, decreased expression of a TGF\u03b2 receptor beta-glycan, decreased activity of lipoprotein lipase, which associates with vascular cell surfaces by binding to glycosaminoglycans, and decreased uptake of VLDL. The soleus muscle is smaller and hind- and fore-limb grip strength is reduced in Thbs4\u2212/\u2212 mice compared to wild-type mice. These observations suggest that TSP-4 regulates the composition of the ECM at major sites of its deposition, tendon and muscle, and the absence of TSP-4 alters the organization, composition and physiological functions of these tissues.",

Thrombospondin-1 and its receptor CD47 are expressed on exosomes/ectosomes derived from T cells, and these extracellular vesicles are internalized and modulate signaling in both T cells and endothelial cells. Extracellular vesicles released from cells expressing or lacking CD47 differentially regulate activation of T cells induced by engaging the T cell receptor. Similarly, T cell-derived extracellular vesicles modulate endothelial cell responses to vascular endothelial growth factor and tube formation in a CD47-dependent manner. Uptake of T cell derived extracellular vesicles by recipient endothelial cells globally alters gene expression in a CD47-dependent manner. CD47 also regulates the mRNA content of extracellular vesicles in a manner consistent with some of the resulting alterations in target endothelial cell gene expression.

Multiple ECM proteins are conserved from sponges to human, raising questions about the evolutionary origin of ECM. Choanoflagellates are the closest unicellular relatives of the metazoa and proteins with domains characteristic of metazoan ECM proteins have been identified from the genome-predicted proteome of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. However, a systematic analysis of M. brevicollis secretory signal peptide-containing proteins with ECM domains has been lacking. We analysed all predicted secretory signal-peptide-containing proteins of M. brevicollis for ECM domains. Nine domains that are widespread in metazoan ECM proteins are represented, with EGF, fibronectin III, laminin G, and von Willebrand Factor_A domains being the most numerous. Three proteins contain more than one category of ECM domain, however, no proteins correspond to the domain architecture of metazoan ECM proteins. The fibronectin III domains are all present within glycoside hydrolases and none contain an integrin-binding motif. Glycosaminoglycan-binding motifs identified in animal thrombospondin type 1 domains are conserved in some M. brevicollis representatives of this domain, whereas there is little evidence of conservation of glycosaminoglycan-binding motifs in the laminin G domains. The identified proteins were compared with the predicted secretory ECM domain-containing proteins of the integrin-expressing filasterean, Capsaspora owczarzaki. C. owczarzaki encodes a smaller number of secretory, ECM domain-containing proteins and only EGF, fibronectin type III and laminin G domains are represented. The M. brevicollis and C. owczarzaki proteins have distinct domain architectures and all proteins differ in their domain architecture to metazoan ECM proteins. These identifications provide a basis for future experiments to validate the extracellular location of these proteins and uncover their functions in choanoflagellates and C. owczarzaki. The data strengthen the model that ECM proteins are metazoan-specific and evolved as innovations in the last common metazoan ancestor.",

Central to this cross-talk is endothelial generated nitric oxide (NO) that stimulates relaxation of the contractile vascular smooth muscle (VSMC) layer of blood vessels. In cardiovascular disease this balanced interaction is disrupted and NO signaling is lost. Work over the last several years indicates that regulation of NO is much more complex than previously believed. It is now apparent that the secreted protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), that is upregulated in cardiovascular disease and animal models of the same, on activating cell surface receptor CD47, redundantly inhibits NO production and NO signaling. This inhibitory event has implications for baseline and disease-related responses mediated by NO. Further work has identified that TSP1-CD47 signaling stimulates enzymatic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production to further limit blood flow and promote vascular disease.

These proteins modulate a variety of cell functions through a range of interactions with cell-surface receptors, hormones, proteases and structural components of the ECM. As such, matricellular proteins are crucial regulators of cell phenotype, and consequently tissue function. The distinct cell types and microenvironments that together form the IVD provide an excellent paradigm to study how matricellular proteins mediate communication within and between adjacent tissue types. In recent years, the role of several matricellular proteins in the intervertebral disc has been explored in vivo using mutant mouse models in which the expression of target matricellular proteins was deleted from either one or all compartments of the intervertebral disc. The current review outlines what is presently known about the roles of the matricellular proteins belonging to the CCN family, SPARC (Secreted Protein, Acidic, and Rich in Cysteine), and thrombospondin (TSP) 2 in regulating intervertebral disc cell\u2013ECM interactions, ECM synthesis and disc tissue homeostasis using genetically modified mouse models. Furthermore, we provide a brief overview of recent preliminary studies of other matricellular proteins including, periostin (POSTN) and tenascin (TN). Each specific tissue type of the IVD contains a different matricellular protein signature, which varies based on the specific stage of development, maturity or disease. A growing body of direct genetic evidence links IVD development, maintenance and repair to the coordinate interaction of matricellular proteins within their respective niches and suggests that several of these signaling modulators hold promise in the development of diagnostics and/or therapeutics targeting intervertebral disc aging and/or degeneration.",

Dysregulation of tissue microenvironment can drive various inflammatory diseases and tumors. The ECM is a crucial component of tissue microenvironment. ECM proteins can not only modulate tissue microenvironment but also regulate the behavior of surrounding cells and the homeostasis of tissues. As a nonstructural ECM protein, periostin is generally present at low levels in most adult tissues; however, periostin is often highly expressed at sites of injury or inflammation and in tumors within adult organisms. Current evidence demonstrates that periostin actively contributes to tissue injury, inflammation, fibrosis and tumor progression. Here, we summarize the roles of periostin in inflammatory and tumor microenvironments.",

R-spondins positively regulate canonical Wnt signaling by reducing Wnt receptor turnover and thereby increasing beta-catenin stabilization. R-spondins are prominently expressed in the developing skeleton and contribute to limb formation, particularly of the distal digit.

Within the embryo, the heart tube serves as an informative developmental paradigm to analyze functional aspects of matricellular proteins. Here, we describe two essential extracellular matricellular proteins, Multiplexin (Mp) and Lonely heart (Loh). Each of these proteins contributes to the development and morphogenesis of the heart tube by regulating the activity/localization of essential extracellular proteins. Mp, which is secreted by heart cardioblasts and is specifically distributed in the lumen of the heart tube, binds to the signaling protein Slit, and facilitates its local signaling at the heart's luminal domain. Loh is an ADAMTS-like protein, which serves as an adapter protein to Pericardin (a collagen-like protein), promoting its specific localization at the abluminal domain of the heart tube. We also introduce the Drosophila orthologues of matricellular proteins present in mammals, including Thrombospondin, and SPARC, and discuss a possible role for Teneurins (Ten-A and Ten-M) in the heart. Understanding the role of these proteins provides a novel developmental perspective into the functional contribution of matricellular proteins to organ development.",

The thrombospondin gene family is composed of matricellular proteins that associate with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and regulate processes in the matrix. Mutations in COMP interfere with calcium-binding, protein conformation and export to the extracellular matrix, resulting in inappropriate intracellular COMP retention. This accumulation of misfolded protein is cytotoxic and triggers premature death of chondrocytes during linear bone growth, leading to shortened long bones. Both in vitro and in vivo models have been employed to study the molecular processes underlying development of the PSACH pathology. Here, we compare the strengths and weaknesses of current mouse models of PSACH and discuss how the resulting phenotypes may be translated to clinical therapies.",

Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is the main risk factor for developing glaucoma and is caused by impaired aqueous humor drainage through the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC). In primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), this elevation in IOP in turn leads to deformation at the optic nerve head (ONH) specifically at the lamina cribrosa (LC) region where there is also a deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules such as collagen and fibronectin.Matricellular proteins are non-structural secreted glycoproteins that help cells communicate with their surrounding ECM. This family of proteins includes connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), also known as CCN2, thrombospondins (TSPs), secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), periostin, osteonectin, and Tenascin-C and -X and other ECM proteins. All members appear to play a role in fibrosis and increased ECM deposition. Most are widely expressed in tissues particularly in the TM and ONH and deficiency of TSP1 and SPARC have been shown to lower IOP in mouse models of glaucoma through enhanced outflow facility. The role of these proteins in glaucoma is emerging as some have an association with the pathophysiology of the TM and LC regions and might therefore be potential targets for therapeutic intervention in glaucoma.",

Moreover, the abluminal side of blood and/or lymphatic vessels and the nerve perineurium, common tracks of tumor cell dissemination, express \u03b14-laminins, and these laminin isoforms, when expressed in the stroma, may contribute to tumor invasion. In the present study, we examined ten mAbs to human laminin \u03b14 chain for their reactivity with the isolated laminin \u03b14 globular domain, their ability to inhibit tumor cell adhesion and migration on laminins 411 and 421, and their effect on the binding of \u03b16\u03b21 integrin and MCAM to both \u03b14-laminins. Most of the mAbs reacted with the laminin \u03b14 globular domain, but only two, mAbs FC10 and 084, significantly inhibited tumor cell adhesion and migration on laminin-411. When used in combination, these antibodies practically abolished the cell adhesion and migration on laminin-411 and significantly reduced the cellular responses on laminin-421. Accordingly, mAbs FC10 and 084 significantly inhibited the binding of purified \u03b16\u03b21 integrin and MCAM to laminins 411 and 421.

Unexpectedly, these sequences not only provide elasticity to the whole protein, but are also able to form amyloid-like fibrils. Even though amyloid fibrils have been associated for a long time to the development of serious disorders as Alzheimer's disease, recent evidence suggests that toxicity may be related to oligomeric species or to pre-fibrillar intermediates, rather than to mature fibrils. In addition, a number of studies highlighted the potential of \u201cbio-inspired\u201d materials based on amyloid-like nanostructures.The present study has been undertaken with the aim to characterize a chemically synthesized elastin-like peptide (VGGVG)3. Structural and biological features were compared with those of peptides as poly(VGGVG) and VGGVG that, having the same amino acid sequence, but different length and supramolecular structure have been previously investigated for their amyloidogenic properties. Results demonstrate that a minimum sequence of 15 amino acids is sufficient to aggregate into short amyloid-like fibrils, whose formation is however strictly dependent on the specific VGGVG repeated sequence. Moreover, in the attempt to elucidate the relationship among aggregation properties, fibers morphology and biocompatibility, 3T3 fibroblasts were grown in the presence of VGGVG-containing elastin-like peptides (ELPs) and analyzed for their ability to proliferate, attach and spread on ELPs-coated surfaces. Data clearly show that amyloid-like fibrils made of (VGGVG)3 are not cytotoxic at least up to the concentration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, even after several days of culture, and are a good support for cell attachment and spreading.",

We hypothesized that the fat depot-specific gene signature of Sca1high ASCs may play the major role in defining adipose tissue function and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling in a depot-specific manner. Herein we aimed to characterize the unique gene signature and ECM remodeling of Sca1high ASCs isolated from subcutaneous (inguinal) and visceral (epididymal) adipose tissues. Sca1high ASCs are found in the adventitia and perivascular areas of adipose tissues. Sca1high ASCs purified with magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) demonstrate dendrite or round shape with the higher expression of cytokines and chemokines (e.g., Il6, Cxcl1) and the lower expression of a glucose transporter (Glut1). Subcutaneous and visceral fat-derived Sca1high ASCs particularly differ in the gene expressions of adhesion and ECM molecules. While the expression of the major membrane-type collagenase (MMP14) is comparable between the groups, the expressions of secreted collagenases (MMP8 and MMP13) are higher in visceral Sca1high ASCs than in subcutaneous ASCs. Consistently, slow but focal MMP-dependent collagenolysis was observed with subcutaneous adipose tissue-derived vascular stromal cells, whereas rapid and bulk collagenolysis was observed with visceral adipose tissue-derived cells in MMP-dependent and -independent manners. These results suggest that the fat depot-specific gene signatures of ASCs may contribute to the distinct patterns of ECM remodeling and adipose function in different fat depots.",

     "abstract": "This study describes a new mechanism controlling the production of alternatively spliced isoforms of type II procollagen (Col2a1) in vivo. During chondrogenesis, precursor chondrocytes predominantly produce isoforms containing alternatively spliced exon 2 (type IIA and IID) while Col2a1 mRNA devoid of exon 2 (type IIB) is the major isoform produced by differentiated chondrocytes. We previously identified an additional Col2a1 isoform containing a truncated exon 2 and premature termination codons in exon 6 (type IIC). This transcript is produced by utilization of another 5\u2032 splice site present in exon 2. To determine the role of this IIC splicing event in vivo, we generated transgenic mice containing silent knock-in mutations at the IIC 5\u2032 splice site (Col2a1-mIIC), thereby inhibiting production of IIC transcripts. Heterozygous and homozygous knock-in mice were viable and display no overt skeletal phenotype to date. However, RNA expression profiles revealed that chondrocytes in cartilage from an age range of Col2a1-mIIC mice produced higher levels of IIA and IID mRNAs and decreased levels of IIB mRNAs throughout pre-natal and post-natal development, when compared to chondrocytes from littermate control mice. Immunofluorescence analyses showed a clear increase in expression of embryonic type II collagen protein isoforms (i.e. containing the exon 2-encoded cysteine-rich (CR) protein domain) in cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM). Interestingly, at P14, P28 and P56, expression of embryonic Col2a1 isoforms in Col2a1-mIIC mice persisted in the pericellular domain of the ECM in articular and growth plate cartilage. We also show that persistent expression of the exon 2-encoded CR domain in the ECM of post-natal cartilage tissue may be due, in part, to the embryonic form of type XI collagen (the \u03b13 chain of which is also encoded by the Col2a1 gene). In conclusion, expression of the Col2a1 IIC splice form may have a regulatory function in controlling alternative splicing of exon 2 to generate defined proportions of IIA, IID and IIB procollagen isoforms during cartilage development. Future studies will involve ultrastructural and biomechanical analysis of the collagen ECM to determine the effects of persistent mis-expression of embryonic collagen isoforms in mature cartilage tissue.",

During prostate cancer (PCa) cell invasion, a variety of proteolytic enzymes are expressed that digest BM components including perlecan. An enzyme upregulated in invasive PCa cells, matrilysin/matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7), was examined as a candidate for perlecan proteolysis both in silico and in vitro. Purified perlecan showed high sensitivity to MMP-7 digestion even when fully decorated with HS or when presented in native context connected with other BM proteins. In both conditions, MMP-7 produced discrete perlecan fragments corresponding to an origin in immunoglobulin (Ig) repeat region domain IV. While not predicted by in silico analysis, MMP-7 cleaved every subpart of recombinantly generated perlecan domain IV. Other enzymes relevant to PCa that were tested had limited ability to cleave perlecan including prostate specific antigen, hepsin, or fibroblast activation protein \u03b1. A long C-terminal portion of perlecan domain IV, Dm IV-3, induced a strong clustering phenotype in the metastatic PCa cell lines, PC-3 and C4-2. MMP-7 digestion of Dm IV-3 reverses the clustering effect into one favoring cell dispersion. In a C4-2 Transwell\u00ae invasion assay, perlecan-rich human BM extract that was pre-digested with MMP-7 showed loss of barrier function and permitted a greater level of cell penetration than untreated BM extract. We conclude that enzymatic processing of perlecan in the BM or territorial matrix by MMP-7 as occurs in the invasive tumor microenvironment acts as a molecular switch to alter PCa cell behavior and favor cell dispersion and invasiveness.",

The central collagenous domain of Col7 contains several interruptions of the collagen triple helix. The longest interruption is 39 amino acids long and referred to as the hinge region. The hinge region is highly conserved between species. This region was predicted to adopt a coiled coil structure and to serve as the trimerization domain of Col7.To gain insight into the potential function of the hinge region we investigated a heterologous expressed peptide by CD and NMR spectroscopy. CD spectroscopy implies that the hinge region is intrinsically disordered. Resonance assignment was performed and allowed secondary structure analysis based on the chemical shift values. Seven amino acids in the N-terminal moiety show residual \u03b1-helical conformation. Subsequent investigation of temperature dependency of amide chemical shifts indicated participation in hydrogen bonding of amino acid residues in the C-terminal moiety of the hinge region. Therefore, the hinge region does not form a coiled coil structure under the employed experimental conditions.

     "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan composed by repeating units of D-glucuronic acid (GlcUA) and N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) that is ubiquitously present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) where it has a critical role in the physiology and pathology of several mammalian tissues. HA represents a perfect environment in which cells can migrate and proliferate. Moreover, several receptors can interact with HA at cellular level triggering multiple signal transduction responses. The control of the HA synthesis is therefore critical in ECM assembly and cell biology; in this review we address the metabolic regulation of HA synthesis. In contrast with other glycosaminoglycans, which are synthesized in the Golgi apparatus, HA is produced at the plasma membrane by HA synthases (HAS1-3), which use cytoplasmic UDP-glucuronic acid and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as substrates. UDP-GlcUA and UDP-hexosamine availability is critical for the synthesis of GAGs, which is an energy consuming process. AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which is considered a sensor of the energy status of the cell and is activated by low ATP:AMP ratio, leads to the inhibition of HA secretion by HAS2 phosphorylation at threonine 110. However, the most general sensor of cellular nutritional status is the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway that brings to the formation of UDP-GlcNAc and intracellular protein glycosylation by O-linked attachment of the monosaccharide \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAcylation) to specific aminoacid residues. Such highly dynamic and ubiquitous protein modification affects serine 221 residue of HAS2 that lead to a dramatic stabilization of the enzyme in the membranes.",

EXTL2, one of the three EXT-like genes in the human genome that are homologous to EXT1 and EXT2, encodes an N-acetylhexosaminyltransferase. However, both the role of EXTL2 in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis and the biological significance of EXTL2 remain unclear. Interestingly, EXTL2 can transfer a GlcNAc residue to the tetrasaccharide linkage region when this region is phosphorylated by a xylose kinase 1 (FAM20B) and thereby terminate chain elongation. Production of GAGs was significantly higher in EXTL2-knockout mice than in wild-type mice. EXTL2-knockout mice are viable and apparently healthy during development and after birth. Therefore, EXTL2-knockout mice were analyzed following the experimental induction of two separate pathological conditions. Carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) was used to induce liver failure, and 5/6th nephrectomy in combination with a high-phosphate diet was used to induce chronic kidney disease (CKD). Under conditions of CCl4-induced liver failure, hepatocyte proliferation following CCl4 treatment was lower in EXTL2-knockout mice than in wild-type mice; consequently, liver regeneration was impaired in EXTL2-knockout mice. This reduction in hepatocyte proliferation resulted partially because EXTL2-knockout mice experienced less hepatocyte-growth-factor-mediated signaling than did wild-type mice. Under conditions of induced CKD, matrix mineralization in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in aortic rings of EXTL2-knockout mice was enhanced relative to that in wild-type mice. Altered biosynthesis of GAGs in EXTL2-knockout mice affected bone-morphogenetic-protein signaling, and consequently enhanced the differentiation of VSMCs into osteoblasts. Taken together, these results indicated that the EXTL2-dependent mechanism that regulates GAG biosynthesis is important for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis under pathological conditions, that is, lack of EXTL2 causes GAG overproduction and structural changes of GAGs associated with pathological processes.",

     "abstract": "Embryonic development is an exceptionally dynamic process, requiring a provisional extracellular matrix that is amenable to rapid remodeling, and proteolytic or non-proteolytic mechanisms that can remodel the major components of this matrix. Versican is a chondroitin-sulfate proteoglycan that forms highly hydrated complexes with hyaluronan and is widely distributed in the provisional matrix of mammalian embryos. It has been extensively studied in the context of cardiovascular morphogenesis, neural crest cell migration and skeletal development. Analysis of Vcan transgenic mice has established the requirement for versican in cardiac development and its role in skeletogenesis. The ADAMTS family includes several versican-degrading proteases that are active during remodeling of the embryonic provisional matrix, especially during sculpting of versican-rich tissues. Versican is cleaved at specific peptide bonds by ADAMTS proteases, and the cleavage products are detectable by neo-epitope antibodies. Myocardial compaction, closure of the secondary palate (in which neural crest derived cells participate), endocardial cushion remodeling, myogenesis and interdigital web regression are developmental contexts in which ADAMTS-mediated versican proteolysis has been identified as a crucial requirement. ADAMTS proteases are expressed coordinately and function cooperatively in many of these contexts. In addition to versican clearance, ADAMTS proteases generate a bioactive versican fragment containing the N-terminal G1 domain, which we have named versikine. This review promotes the view that the embryonic extracellular matrix has evolved not only to provide a permissive environment for embryo growth and morphogenesis, but through its dissolution to influence and regulate cellular processes.",

     "abstract": "The highly conserved eukaryotic process of macroautophagy (autophagy) is a non-specific bulk-degradation program critical for maintaining proper cellular homeostasis, and for clearing aged and damaged organelles. This decision is inextricably dependent upon prevailing metabolic demands and energy requirements of the cell. Soluble monomeric decorin functions as a natural tumor repressor that antagonizes a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently, we discovered that decorin induces endothelial cell autophagy, downstream of VEGFR2. This process was wholly dependent upon Peg3, a decorin-inducible genomically imprinted tumor suppressor gene. However, the signaling cascades responsible have remained elusive. In this report we discovered that Vps34, a class III phosphoinositide kinase, is an upstream kinase required for Peg3 induction. Moreover, decorin triggered differential formation of Vps34/Beclin 1 complexes with concomitant dissolution of inhibitive Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complexes. Further, decorin inhibited anti-autophagic signaling via suppression of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K activity with the concurrent activation of pro-autophagic AMPK-mediated signaling cascades. Mechanistically, AMPK is downstream of VEGFR2 and inhibition of AMPK signaling abrogated decorin-evoked autophagy. Collectively, these findings hint at the complexity of the underlying molecular relays necessary for decorin-evoked endothelial cell autophagy and reveal important therapeutic targets for augmenting autophagy and combatting tumor angiogenesis.",

Several studies have demonstrated the presence of heparan sulfate (HS) or HSPGs in the cell nucleus, but little attention has been focused on their role there.

In mammals, a family of seven heparan sulfate 3-O-sulfotransferases installs sulfate groups at this position and constitutes the largest group of sulfotransferases involved in heparan sulfate formation.

     "abstract": "Numerous extracellular proteins, growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, enzymes, lipoproteins, involved in a variety of biological processes, interact with heparin and/or heparan sulfate at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (ECM). The goal of this study is to investigate the relationship(s) between affinity and kinetics of heparin\u2013protein interactions and the localization of the proteins, their intrinsic disorder and their biological roles. Most proteins bind to heparin with a higher affinity than their fragments and form more stable complexes with heparin than with heparan sulfate. Lipoproteins and matrisome-associated proteins (e.g. growth factors and cytokines) bind to heparin with very high affinity. Matrisome-associated proteins form transient complexes with heparin. However they bind to this glycosaminoglycan with a higher affinity than the proteins of the core matrisome, which contribute to ECM assembly and organization, and than the secreted proteins which are not associated with the ECM. The association rate of proteins with heparin is related to the intrinsic disorder of heparin-binding sites. Enzyme inhibitor activity, protein dimerization, skeletal system development and pathways in cancer are functionally associated with proteins displaying a high or very high affinity for heparin (KD\u00a0<\u00a0100\u00a0nM). Besides their use in investigating molecular recognition and functions, kinetics and affinity are essential to prioritize interactions in networks and to build network models as discussed for the interaction network established at the surface of endothelial cells by endostatin, a heparin-binding protein regulating angiogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The proteoglycan decorin, a key component of the tumor stroma, regulates the action of several tyrosine-kinase receptors, including the EGFR, Met and the IGF-IR. Notably, the action of decorin in regulating the IGF-I system differs between normal and transformed cells. In normal cells, decorin binds with high affinity to both the natural ligand IGF-I and the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and positively regulates IGF-IR activation and downstream signaling. In contrast, in transformed cells, decorin negatively regulates ligand-induced IGF-IR activation, downstream signaling and IGF-IR-dependent biological responses. Whether decorin may bind another member of the IGF-I system, the insulin receptor A isoform (IR-A) and its cognate ligands, insulin, IGF-II and proinsulin, have not been established. Here we show that decorin bound with high affinity insulin and IGF-II and, to a lesser extent, proinsulin and IR-A. We utilized as a cell model system mouse embryonic fibroblasts homozygous for a targeted disruption of the Igf1r gene (designated R\u2212 cells) which were stably transfected with a human construct harboring the IR-A isoform of the receptor. Using these R\u2212/IR-A cells, we demonstrate that decorin did not affect ligand-induced phosphorylation of the IR-A but enhanced IR-A downregulation after prolonged IGF-II stimulation without affecting insulin and proinsulin-dependent effects on IR-A stability. In addition, decorin significantly inhibited IGF-II-mediated activation of the Akt pathways, without affecting insulin and proinsulin-dependent signaling. Notably, decorin significantly inhibited IGF-II-mediated cell proliferation of R\u2212/IR-A cells but affected neither insulin- nor proinsulin-dependent mitogenesis. Collectively, these results suggest that decorin differentially regulates the action of IR-A ligands. Decorin preferentially inhibits IGF-II-mediated biological responses but does not affect insulin- or proinsulin-dependent signaling. Thus, decorin loss may contribute to tumor initiation and progression in malignant neoplasms which depend on an IGF-II/IR-A autocrine loop.",

     "abstract": "Decorin is a small leucine-rich proteoglycan harboring a single glycosaminoglycan chain, which, in skin, is mainly composed of dermatan sulfate (DS). Mutant mice with targeted disruption of the decorin gene (Dcn\u2212/\u2212) exhibit an abnormal collagen architecture in the dermis and reduced tensile strength, collectively leading to a skin fragility phenotype. Notably, Ehlers\u2013Danlos patients with mutations in enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of DS display a similar phenotype, and recent studies indicate that DS is involved in growth factor binding and signaling. To determine the impact of the loss of DS-decorin in the dermis, we analyzed the glycosaminoglycan content of Dcn\u2212/\u2212 and wild-type mouse skin. The total amount of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate (CS/DS) was increased in the Dcn\u2212/\u2212 skin, but was overall less sulfated with a significant reduction in bisulfated \u0394DiS2,X (X\u00a0=\u00a04 or 6) disaccharide units, due to the reduced expression of uronyl 2-O sulfotransferase (Ust). With increasing age, sulfation declined; however, Dcn\u2212/\u2212 CS/DS was constantly undersulfated vis-\u00e0-vis wild-type. Functionally, we found altered fibroblast growth factor (Fgf)-7 and -2 binding due to changes in the micro-heterogeneity of skin Dcn\u2212/\u2212 CS/DS. To better delineate the role of decorin, we used a 3D Dcn\u2212/\u2212 fibroblast cell culture model. We found that the CS/DS extracts of wild-type and Dcn\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts were similar to the skin sugars, and this correlated with the lack of uronyl 2-O sulfotransferase in the Dcn\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts. Moreover, Ffg7 binding to total CS/DS was attenuated in the Dcn\u2212/\u2212 samples. Surprisingly, wild-type CS/DS significantly reduced the binding of Fgf7 to keratinocytes in a concentration dependent manner unlike the Dcn\u2212/\u2212 CS/DS that only affected the binding at higher concentrations. Although binding to cell-surfaces was quite similar at higher concentrations, keratinocyte proliferation was differentially affected. Higher concentration of Dcn\u2212/\u2212 CS/DS induced proliferation in contrast to wild-type CS/DS. 3D co-cultures of fibroblasts and keratinocytes showed that, unlike Dcn\u2212/\u2212 CS/DS, wild-type CS/DS promoted differentiation of keratinocytes. Collectively, our results provide novel mechanistic explanations for the reported defects in wound healing in Dcn\u2212/\u2212 mice and possibly Ehlers\u2013Danlos patients. Moreover, the lack of decorin-derived DS and an altered CS/DS composition differentially influence keratinocyte behavior.",

In the Bgn\u2212/0/Lum\u2212/\u2212 corneas there were abnormal lamellar and fibril structures consistent with the functional deficit in transparency. Lamellar structure was disrupted across the stroma with disorganized fibrils, and altered fibril packing.

This was not observed in the Bgn\u2212/0 or wild type corneas and was restricted to the posterior stroma in Lum\u2212/\u2212 mice.

In this study we characterized the glycosaminoglycan side chains of perlecan isolated from either primary human coronary artery smooth muscle or endothelial cells and determined their roles in mediating cell adhesion and proliferation, and in fibroblast growth factor (FGF) binding and signaling. Smooth muscle cell perlecan was decorated with both heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, whereas endothelial perlecan contained exclusively heparan sulfate chains. Smooth muscle cells bound to the protein core of perlecan only when the glycosaminoglycans were removed, and this binding involved a novel site in domain III as well as domain V/endorepellin and the \u03b12\u03b21 integrin. In contrast, endothelial cells adhered to the protein core of perlecan in the presence of glycosaminoglycans. Smooth muscle cell perlecan bound both FGF1 and FGF2 via its heparan sulfate chains and promoted the signaling of FGF2 but not FGF1. Also endothelial cell perlecan bound both FGF1 and FGF2 via its heparan sulfate chains, but in contrast, promoted the signaling of both growth factors. Based on this differential bioactivity, we propose that perlecan synthesized by smooth muscle cells differs from that synthesized by endothelial cells by possessing different signaling capabilities, primarily, but not exclusively, due to a differential glycanation. The end result is a differential modulation of cell adhesion, proliferation and growth factor signaling in these two key cellular constituents of blood vessels.",

Here we show that, in the human mast cell line HMC-1, the transcription of this gene results in a population of mRNA that is processed in such a way to provide a relative increase of transcripts corresponding to domain V or the C-terminus compared to transcripts from either domain III or the N-terminal domain I. This paper also presents evidence of splicing of the HSPG2 gene in HMC-1 cells at exons 2/3 and after comparing this sequence with those published in various databases, a model is postulated to explain what might be happening in these cells with regard to the transcription of the HSPG2 gene. As domain V of perlecan contains the \u03b12\u03b21 integrin binding site that modulates angiogenesis, we hypothesize that the transcriptional control of the HSPG2 gene in mast cells to synthesize these transcripts supports their stimulatory and specific role in wound healing and tissue regeneration.",

     "abstract": "Matrix-bound constituents, such as the small leucine-rich proteoglycan biglycan, can act as powerful signaling molecules when released by limited proteolysis of the extracellular matrix or de novo synthesized by macrophages in the circulation and body fluids. Specifically, biglycan acts as an endogenous ligand of innate immunity by directly engaging the Toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and -4. In this study, we generated a transient transgenic mouse model where biglycan was de novo overproduced by hepatocytes driven by the albumin promoter. Transgenic biglycan was rapidly and abundantly synthesized by hepatocytes and released into the bloodstream. Notably, we found that circulating biglycan accumulated in the kidneys where it caused recruitment of leukocytes infiltrating the renal parenchyma concurrent with abnormal renal levels of chemoattractants CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL2 and CCL5. Using mice deficient in either TLR adapter proteins MyD88 or TRIF we discovered that MyD88 deficiency drastically reduced neutrophil and macrophage infiltration in the kidney, whereas TRIF deficiency decreased T cell infiltrates. Production of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL2 required MyD88, whereas the levels of T cell and macrophage attractant CCL5 required TRIF. Thus, we provide robust genetic evidence for circulating biglycan as a powerful pro-inflammatory mediator targeting the renal parenchyma. Furthermore, our results provide the first evidence that biglycan differentially triggers chemoattraction of leukocytes via two independent pathways, both under the control of TLR2/4, utilizing either MyD88 or TRIF adaptor proteins. As aberrant expression of biglycan occurs in several inflammatory diseases, this transient transgenic mouse model could serve as a valuable research tool in investigating the effects of increased biglycan expression in vivo and for the development of therapeutic strategies in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

During disease endogenous danger signals stimulate innate immune cells via Toll-like receptors (TLR)-2 and -4 and accelerate inflammatory responses. Here we show that production of soluble biglycan, a small leucine-rich proteoglycan, is induced during reperfusion and that it functions as endogenous agonist of TLR-2/4. Biglycan-mediated activation of TLR-2/4 initiates an inflammatory response in native kidneys, which is marked by the release of cytokines and chemokines and recruitment of inflammatory cells. Overexpression of soluble circulating biglycan before ischemic reperfusion enhanced plasma and renal levels of TNF-\u03b1, CXCL1, CCL2 and CCL5, caused influx of neutrophils, macrophages and T cells and overall worsened renal function in wild type mice. We provide robust genetic evidence for TLR-2/4 requirement insofar as biglycan biological effects were markedly dampened in mice deficient in both innate immune receptors, Tlr2\u2212/\u2212;Tlr4\u2212/\u2212 mice.

     "abstract": "Versican is an extracellular matrix (ECM) proteoglycan that interacts with cells by binding to non-integrin and integrin receptors and to other ECM components that associate with the cell surface. Recent studies have shown also that versican interacts with myeloid and lymphoid cells promoting their adhesion and production of inflammatory cytokines. Versican is produced by stromal cells, as well as leukocytes, and is markedly increased in inflammation. Inflammatory agonists, such as double-stranded RNA mimetics (e.g., poly I:C), stimulate stromal cells, smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts, to produce fibrillar ECMs enriched in versican and hyaluronan (HA) that interact with leukocytes promoting their adhesion. Interference with the incorporation of versican into this ECM blocks monocyte adhesion and dampens the inflammatory response. Tumor cells also express elevated levels of versican which interact with myeloid cells to promote an inflammatory response, through stimulating cytokine release, and metastasis. In addition, myeloid cells, such as macrophages in tumors, synthesize versican which affects tumor cell phenotypes, inflammation, and subsequent metastasis. Versican, by binding to hyaluronan, influences T lymphocyte phenotypes and in part controls the ability of these cells to synthesize and secrete cytokines that influence the immune response. Collectively, these studies indicate that versican as an ECM molecule plays a central role in inflammation and as a result it is emerging as a potential target promising wide therapeutic benefits.",

Mice were treated with intratracheal (IT) live Escherichia coli, E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or PBS. Both E. coli and LPS caused rapid selective increases in mRNA expression of versican and hyaluronan synthase (Has) isoforms 1 and 2 associated with increased immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for versican and hyaluronan in the lungs. Versican was associated with a subset of alveolar macrophages. To examine whether macrophages contribute to versican and hyaluronan accumulation, in vitro studies with primary cultures of bone marrow-derived and alveolar macrophages were performed. Unstimulated macrophages expressed very low levels of versican and hyaluronan synthase mRNA, with no detectible versican protein or hyaluronan product. Stimulation with LPS caused rapid increases in versican mRNA and protein, a rapid increase in Has1 mRNA, and concomitant inhibition of hyaluronidases 1 and 2, the major hyaluronan degrading enzymes. Hyaluronan could be detected following chloroquine pre-treatment, indicating rapid turnover and degradation of hyaluronan by macrophages. In addition, the effects of LPS, the M1 macrophage classical activation agonist, were compared to those of IL-4/IL-13 or IL-10, the M2a and M2c alternative activation agonists, respectively. Versican and Has1 increased only in response to M1 activation. Finally, the up-regulation of versican and Has1 in the whole lungs of wild-type mice following IT LPS was completely abrogated in TLR-4\u2212/\u2212 mice.

The functions of HSPGs are mainly mediated through interactions of the heparan sulfate (HS) polysaccharide side chains with different protein ligands. The molecular structure of HS is highly diverse, expressed in a cell-type specific manner. The flexible yet controlled structure of HS is primarily generated through a strictly regulated biosynthesis process and is further modified post-synthetically, such as desulfation by endosulfatases and fragmentation by heparanase. Heparanase is an endo-glucuronidase expressed in all tissues. The enzyme has been found up-regulated in a number of pathological conditions, implying a role in diseases mainly through degradation of HS. Emerging evidence demonstrates important roles of HS and heparanase in inflammatory reactions, particularly in the regulation of leukocyte activation and extravasation.

     "abstract": "In hormone-dependent breast cancer, estrogen receptors are the principal signaling molecules that regulate several cell functions either by the genomic pathway acting directly as transcription factors in the nucleus or by the non-genomic pathway interacting with other receptors and their adjacent pathways like EGFR/IGFR. It is well established in literature that EGFR and IGFR signaling pathways promote cell proliferation and differentiation. Moreover, recent data indicate the cross-talk between ERs and EGFR/IGFR signaling pathways causing a transformation of cell functions as well as deregulation on normal expression pattern of matrix molecules. Specifically, proteoglycans, a major category of extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell surface macromolecules, are modified during malignancy and cause alterations in cancer cell signaling, affecting eventually functional cell properties such as proliferation, adhesion and migration. The on-going strategies to block only one of the above signaling effectors result cancer cells to overcome such inactivation using alternative signaling pathways. In this article, we therefore review the underlying mechanisms in respect to the role of ERs and the involvement of cross-talk between ERs, IGFR and EGFR in breast cancer cell properties and expression of extracellular secreted and cell bound proteoglycans involved in cancer progression. Understanding such signaling pathways may help to establish new potential pharmacological targets in terms of using ECM molecules to design novel anticancer therapies.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma represents one of the most-rapidly spreading cancers in the world. In the majority of cases, an inflammation-driven fibrosis or cirrhosis precedes the development of the tumor. During malignant transformation, the tumor microenvironment undergoes qualitative and quantitative changes that modulate the behavior of the malignant cells. A key constituent for the hepatic microenvironment is the small leucine-rich proteoglycan decorin, known to interfere with cellular events of tumorigenesis mainly by blocking various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) such as EGFR, Met, IGF-IR, PDGFR and VEGFR2. In this study, we characterized cell signaling events evoked by decorin deficiency in two experimental models of hepatocarcinogenesis using thioacetamide or diethyl nitrosamine as carcinogens. Genetic ablation of decorin led to enhanced tumor occurrence as compared to wild-type animals. These findings correlated with decreased levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1 and a concurrent elevation in retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation via cyclin dependent kinase 4. Decreased steady state p21Waf1/Cip1 levels correlated with enhanced expression of transcription factor AP4, a known transcriptional repressor of p21Waf1/Cip1, and enhanced c-Myc protein levels. In addition, translocation of \u03b2-catenin was a typical event in diethyl nitrosamine-evoked tumors. In parallel, decreased phosphorylation of both c-Myc and \u03b2-catenin was observed in Dcn\u2212/\u2212 livers likely due to the hindered GSK3\u03b2-mediated targeting of these proteins to proteasomal degradation. We discovered that in a genetic background lacking decorin, four RTKs were constitutively activated (phosphorylated), including three known targets of decorin such as PDGFR\u03b1, EGFR, IGF-IR, and a novel RTK MSPR/RON. Our findings provide powerful genetic evidence for a crucial in vivo role of decorin during hepatocarcinogenesis as lack of decorin in the liver and hepatic stroma facilitates experimental carcinogenesis by providing an environment devoid of this potent pan-RTK inhibitor. Thus, our results support future utilization of decorin as an antitumor agent in liver cancer.",

     "abstract": "In patients with multiple myeloma, the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 (CD138) is shed from the surface of tumor cells and accumulates in the serum and within the extracellular matrix of the bone marrow where it promotes tumor growth and metastasis. In the present study we discovered that commonly used anti-myeloma drugs stimulate syndecan-1 shedding both in vitro and in animals bearing myeloma tumors. Enhanced shedding is accompanied by increased syndecan-1 synthesis prior to drug induced tumor cell death. Addition of a caspase inhibitor blocks the drug-induced shedding of syndecan-1 in vitro indicating that shedding is linked to the onset of apoptosis. ADAM inhibitors or siRNA targeting ADAMs blocked drug-induced shedding suggesting that upregulation or activation of ADAMs is responsible for cleaving syndecan-1 from the tumor cell surface. These results reveal that myeloma chemotherapy stimulates synthesis and shedding of syndecan-1, a potentially negative side effect that may lead to the accumulation of high levels of syndecan-1 to establish a microenvironment that nurtures relapse and promotes tumor progression. Interestingly, we also found that chemotherapeutic drugs stimulated syndecan-1 shedding from pancreatic cancer cells as well, indicating that drug-induced shedding of syndecan-1 may occur in many cancer types. Overall, our results indicate that the use of metalloproteinase inhibitors (to inhibit syndecan-1 shedding) in combination with chemotherapy may represent a novel therapeutic strategy to prevent re-establishment of a microenvironment conducive for tumor relapse.",

     "abstract": "Matrix proteoglycans such as biglycan (Bgn) dominate skeletal tissue and yet its exact role in regulating bone function is still unclear. In this paper we describe the potential role of (Bgn) in the fracture healing process. We hypothesized that Bgn could regulate fracture healing because of previous work showing that it can affect normal bone formation. To test this hypothesis, we created fractures in femurs of 6-week-old male wild type (WT or Bgn+/0) and Bgn-deficient (Bgn-KO or Bgn-/0) mice using a custom-made standardized fracture device, and analyzed the process of healing over time. The formation of a callus around the fracture site was observed at both 7 and 14\u00a0days post-fracture in WT and Bgn-deficient mice and immunohistochemistry revealed that Bgn was highly expressed in the fracture callus of WT mice, localizing within woven bone and cartilage. Micro-computed tomography (\u03bcCT) analysis of the region surrounding the fracture line showed that the Bgn-deficient mice had a smaller callus than WT mice. Histology of the same region also showed the presence of less cartilage and woven bone in the Bgn-deficient mice compared to WT mice. Picrosirius red staining of the callus visualized under polarized light showed that there was less fibrillar collagen in the Bgn-deficient mice, a finding confirmed by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to type I collagen. Interestingly, real time RT-PCR of the callus at 7\u00a0days post-fracture showed a significant decrease in relative vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF) gene expression by Bgn-deficient mice as compared to WT. Moreover, VEGF was shown to bind directly to Bgn through a solid-phase binding assay. The inability of Bgn to directly enhance VEGF-induced signaling suggests that Bgn has a unique role in regulating vessel formation, potentially related to VEGF storage or stabilization in the matrix. Taken together, these results suggest that Bgn has a regulatory role in the process of bone formation during fracture healing, and further, that reduced angiogenesis could be the molecular basis.",

However, despite the increased risk of tendon injury in the elderly, the role of SLRPs in tendon repair has not been investigated in aged animals. Therefore, our objective was to elucidate the influences of bigylcan and decorin on tendon healing in aged mice to relate our findings to previous work in mature mice. Since the processes of aging and healing are known to interact, our hypothesis was that aging mediates the role of biglycan and decorin on tendon healing. Patellar tendons from wild-type, biglycan-null and decorin-null mice were injured at 270\u00a0days using an established model. At 3 and 6\u00a0weeks post-surgery, structural, mechanical and biochemical analyses were performed and compared to uninjured controls. Early stage healing was inferior in biglycan-null and decorin-null mice as compared to wild type. However, tendons of all genotypes failed to exhibit improved mechanical properties between 3 and 6\u00a0weeks post-injury. In contrast, in a previous investigation of tendon healing in mature (i.e., 120\u00a0day-old) mice, only biglycan-null mice were deficient in early stage healing while decorin-null mice were deficient in late-stage healing. These results confirm that the impact of SLRPs on tendon healing is mediated by age and could inform future age-specific therapies for enhancing tendon healing.",

Here, we report developmental heart defects in mice bearing a targeted disruption of the HS-generating enzyme GlcNAc N-deacetylase/GlcN N-sulfotransferase 1 (NDST1), including ventricular septal defects (VSD), persistent truncus arteriosus (PTA), double outlet right ventricle (DORV), and retroesophageal right subclavian artery (RERSC). These defects closely resemble cardiac anomalies observed in mice made deficient in the cardiogenic regulator fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8). Consistent with this, we show that HS-dependent FGF8/FGF-receptor2C assembly and FGF8-dependent ERK-phosphorylation are strongly reduced in NDST1\u2212/\u2212 embryonic cells and tissues. Moreover, WNT1-Cre/LoxP-mediated conditional targeting of NDST function in neural crest cells (NCCs) revealed that their impaired HS-dependent development contributes strongly to the observed cardiac defects. These findings raise the possibility that defects in HS biosynthesis may contribute to congenital heart defects in humans that represent the most common type of birth defect.",

Notably, a subtype of Ehlers\u2013Danlos Syndrome is caused by expression of abnormal biglycan and decorin proteoglycans. As compound deficiency of these two small leucine-rich proteoglycans is a model of preterm birth, we investigated the fetal membranes of Bgn\u2212/\u2212; Dcn\u2212/\u2212 double-null and single-null mice. Our results showed that biglycan signaling supported fetal membrane remodeling during early gestation in the absence of concomitant changes in TGF\u03b2 levels. In late gestation, biglycan signaling acted in a TGF\u03b2-dependent manner to aid in membrane stabilization. In contrast, decorin signaling supported fetal membrane remodeling at early stages of gestation in a TGF\u03b2-dependent manner, and fetal membrane stabilization at later stages of gestation without changes in TGF\u03b2 levels. Furthermore, exogenous soluble decorin was capable of rescuing the TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway in fetal membrane mesenchymal cells. Collectively, these findings provide novel targets for manipulation of fetal membrane extracellular matrix stability and could represent novel targets for research on preventive strategies for preterm premature rupture of fetal membranes.",

Mice were treated with intratracheal (IT) live Escherichia coli, E. coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or PBS. Both E. coli and LPS caused rapid selective increases in mRNA expression of versican and hyaluronan synthase (Has) isoforms 1 and 2 associated with increased immunohistochemical and histochemical staining for versican and hyaluronan in the lungs. Versican was associated with a subset of alveolar macrophages. To examine whether macrophages contribute to versican and hyaluronan accumulation, in vitro studies with primary cultures of bone marrow-derived and alveolar macrophages were performed. Unstimulated macrophages expressed very low levels of versican and hyaluronan synthase mRNA, with no detectible versican protein or hyaluronan product. Stimulation with LPS caused rapid increases in versican mRNA and protein, a rapid increase in Has1 mRNA, and concomitant inhibition of hyaluronidases 1 and 2, the major hyaluronan degrading enzymes. Hyaluronan could be detected following chloroquine pre-treatment, indicating rapid turnover and degradation of hyaluronan by macrophages. In addition, the effects of LPS, the M1 macrophage classical activation agonist, were compared to those of IL-4/IL-13 or IL-10, the M2a and M2c alternative activation agonists, respectively. Versican and Has1 increased only in response to M1 activation. Finally, the up-regulation of versican and Has1 in the whole lungs of wild-type mice following IT LPS was completely abrogated in TLR-4\u2212/\u2212 mice. These findings suggest that versican and hyaluronan synthesis may play an important role in the innate immune response to gram-negative lung infection.",

Impaired maturation causes proteinuria and renal fibrosis in the type IV collagen disease Alport syndrome. This study evaluates the role of collagen receptors in maturation of the GBM, matrix accumulation and renal fibrosis by using mice deficient for discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1), integrin subunit \u03b12 (ITGA2), and type IV collagen \u03b13 (COL4A3). Loss of both collagen receptors DDR1 and integrin \u03b12\u03b21 delays maturation of the GBM: due to a porous GBM filtration barrier high molecular weight proteinuria that more than doubles between day 60 and day 100. Thereafter, maturation of the GBM causes proteinuria to drop down to one tenth until day 200. Proteinuria and the porous GBM cause accumulation of glomerular and tubulointerstitial matrix, which both decrease significantly after GBM-maturation until day 250. In parallel, in a disease with impaired GBM-maturation such as Alport syndrome, loss of integrin \u03b12\u03b21 positively delays renal fibrosis: COL4A3\u2212/\u2212/ITGA2\u2212/\u2212 double knockouts exhibited reduced proteinuria and urea nitrogen compared to COL4A3\u2212/\u2212/ITGA2+/\u2212 and COL4A3\u2212/\u2212/ITGA2+/+ mice. The double knockouts lived 20% longer and showed less glomerular and tubulointerstitial extracellular matrix deposition than the COL4A3\u2212/\u2212 Alport mice with normal integrin \u03b12\u03b21 expression. Electron microscopy illustrated improvements in the glomerular basement membrane structure. MMP2, MMP9, MMP12 and TIMP1 were expressed at significantly higher levels (compared to wild-type mice) in COL4A3\u2212/\u2212/ITGA2+/+ Alport mice, but not in COL4A3+/+/ITGA2\u2212/\u2212 mice. In conclusion, the collagen receptors DDR1 and integrin \u03b12\u03b21 contribute to regulate GBM-maturation and to control matrix accumulation.

The breakdown of ECM can lead to the generation of bioactive fragments that promote cell growth and spread. EMILIN1, a multidomain glycoprotein expressed in several tissues, exerts a crucial regulatory function through the engagement of \u03b14/\u03b19 integrins. Unlike the majority of ECM molecules that elicit a proliferative program, the signals emitting from EMILIN1 engaged by \u03b14/\u03b19\u03b21 integrins are antiproliferative. In this study, aimed to demonstrate if the suppressor role of EMILIN1 was related to its structural integrity, we tested the possibility that EMILIN1 could be specifically cleaved. Among the proteolytic enzymes released in the tumor microenvironment we showed that neutrophil elastase cleaved EMILIN1 in three/four major fragments. The consequence of this proteolytic process was the impairment of its anti-proliferative role. Accordingly, EMILIN1 was digested in sarcomas and ovarian cancers. Sarcoma specimens were infiltrated by neutrophils (PMNs) and stained positively for elastase. The present findings highlight the peculiar activity of PMN elastase in disabling EMILIN1 suppressor function.",

Factors that control and coordinate the functional activities of fibronectin fibrils are not known. Here, we compared effects of cell adhesion to vitronectin versus type I collagen on the assembly of and response to, extracellular matrix fibronectin fibrils. The amount of insoluble fibronectin matrix fibrils assembled by fibronectin-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts adherent to collagen- or vitronectin-coated substrates was not significantly different 20\u00a0h after fibronectin addition. However, the fibronectin matrix produced by vitronectin-adherent cells was ~\u00a010-fold less effective at enhancing cell proliferation than that of collagen-adherent cells. Increasing insoluble fibronectin levels with the fibronectin fragment, anastellin did not increase cell proliferation. Rather, native fibronectin fibrils polymerized by collagen- and vitronectin-adherent cells exhibited conformational differences in the growth-promoting, III-1 region of fibronectin, with collagen-adherent cells producing fibronectin fibrils in a more extended conformation. Fibronectin matrix assembly on either substrate was mediated by \u03b15\u03b21 integrins. However, on vitronectin-adherent cells, \u03b15\u03b21 integrins functioned in a lower activation state, characterized by reduced 9EG7 binding and decreased talin association. The inhibitory effect of vitronectin on fibronectin-mediated cell proliferation was localized to the cell-binding domain, but was not a general property of \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin-binding substrates. These data suggest that adhesion to vitronectin allows for the uncoupling of fibronectin fibril formation from downstream signaling events by reducing \u03b15\u03b21 integrin activation and fibronectin fibril extension.",

     "abstract": "The highly conserved eukaryotic process of macroautophagy (autophagy) is a non-specific bulk-degradation program critical for maintaining proper cellular homeostasis, and for clearing aged and damaged organelles. This decision is inextricably dependent upon prevailing metabolic demands and energy requirements of the cell. Soluble monomeric decorin functions as a natural tumor repressor that antagonizes a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases. Recently, we discovered that decorin induces endothelial cell autophagy, downstream of VEGFR2. This process was wholly dependent upon Peg3, a decorin-inducible genomically imprinted tumor suppressor gene. However, the signaling cascades responsible have remained elusive. In this report we discovered that Vps34, a class III phosphoinositide kinase, is an upstream kinase required for Peg3 induction. Moreover, decorin triggered differential formation of Vps34/Beclin 1 complexes with concomitant dissolution of inhibitive Bcl-2/Beclin 1 complexes. Further, decorin inhibited anti-autophagic signaling via suppression of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K activity with the concurrent activation of pro-autophagic AMPK-mediated signaling cascades. Mechanistically, AMPK is downstream of VEGFR2 and inhibition of AMPK signaling abrogated decorin-evoked autophagy. Collectively, these findings hint at the complexity of the underlying molecular relays necessary for decorin-evoked endothelial cell autophagy and reveal important therapeutic targets for augmenting autophagy and combatting tumor angiogenesis.",

These undergo several steps of differentiation from proliferating into hypertrophic chondrocytes, which are subsequently replaced by bone. Chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation are tightly controlled by a complex network of signaling molecules. During recent years, it has become increasingly clear that heparan sulfate (HS) carrying proteoglycans play a critical role in controlling the distribution and activity of these secreted factors. In this review we summarize the current understanding of the role of HS in regulating bone formation. In human, mutations in the HS synthetizing enzymes Ext1 and Ext2 induce the Multiple Osteochondroma syndrome, a skeletal disorder characterized by short stature and the formation of benign cartilage-capped tumors. We review the current insight into the origin of the disease and discuss its possible molecular basis. In addition, we summarize the existing insight into the role of HS as a regulator of signal propagation and signaling strength in the developing skeleton.",

     "abstract": "The extracellular matrix proteoglycan (ECM) perlecan, also known as heparan sulfate proteoglycan 2 or HSPG2, is one of the largest (>\u00a0200\u00a0nm) and oldest (>\u00a0550\u00a0M\u00a0years) extracellular matrix molecules. In vertebrates, perlecan's five-domain structure contains numerous independently folding modules with sequence similarities to other ECM proteins, all connected like cars into one long, diverse complex train following a unique N-terminal domain I decorated with three long glycosaminoglycan chains, and an additional glycosaminoglycan attachment site in the C-terminal domain V. In lower invertebrates, perlecan is not typically a proteoglycan, possessing the majority of the core protein modules, but lacking domain I where the attachment sites for glycosaminoglycan chains are located. This suggests that uniting the heparan sulfate binding growth factor functions of domain I and the core protein functions of the rest of the molecule in domains II\u2013V occurred later in evolution for a new functional purpose. In this review, we surveyed several decades of pertinent literature to ask a fundamental question: Why did nature design this protein uniquely as an extraordinarily long multifunctional proteoglycan with a single promoter regulating expression, rather than separating these functions into individual proteins that could be independently regulated? We arrived at the conclusion that the concentration of perlecan at functional borders separating tissues and tissue layers is an ancient key function of the core protein. The addition of the heparan sulfate chains in domain I likely occurred as an additional means of binding the core protein to other ECM proteins in territorial matrices and basement membranes, and as a means to reserve growth factors in an on-site depot to assist with rapid repair of those borders when compromised, such as would occur during wounding. We propose a function for perlecan that extends its role from that of an extracellular scaffold, as we previously suggested, to that of a critical agent for establishing and patrolling tissue borders in complex tissues in metazoans. We also propose that understanding these unique functions of the individual portions of the perlecan molecule can provide new insights and tools for engineering of complex multi-layered tissues including providing the necessary cues for establishing neotissue borders.",

     "abstract": "Type II collagen, the major fibrillar collagen of cartilage, is synthesized as precursor forms (procollagens) containing N- and C-terminal propeptides. Three splice variants are thought to be translated to produce procollagen II isoforms (IIA/D and IIB) which differ in their amino propeptide parts. The IIA and IID are transient embryonic isoforms that include an additional cysteine-rich domain encoded by exon 2. The IIA and IID transcripts are co-expressed during chondrogenesis then decline and the IIB isoform is the only one expressed and synthesized in fully differentiated chondrocytes. Additionally, procollagens IIA/D can be re-expressed by dedifferentiating chondrocytes and in osteoarthritic cartilage. Therefore, it is an important point to determine which isoform(s) is (are) synthesized in vivo in normal and pathological situations and in vitro, to fully assess the phenotype of cells producing type II collagen protein. Antibodies directed against the cysteine-rich extra domain found in procollagens IIA and IID are already available but antibodies detecting only the chondrogenic IIB form of type II procollagen were missing so far. A synthetic peptide encompassing the junction between exon 1 and exon 3 of the human sequence was used as immunogen to produce rabbit polyclonal antibodies to procollagen IIB. After affinity purification on immobilized peptide their absence of crossreaction with procollagens IIA/D and with the fibrillar procollagens I, III and V was demonstrated by Western blotting. These antibodies were used to reveal at the protein level that the treatment of dedifferentiated human chondrocytes by bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-2 induces the synthesis of the IIB (chondrocytic) isoform of procollagen II. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of bovine cartilage demonstrates the potential of these antibodies in the analysis of the differential spatiotemporal distribution of N-propeptides of procollagens IIA/D and IIB during normal development and in pathological situations.",

In this work we use an atomistic model of a collagen fibril to pinpoint, for the first time, the precise location of amino acids involved in the most relevant AGE, glucosepane. The results show that there are 14 specific lysine\u2013arginine pairs that, due to their relative position and configuration, are likely to form glucosepane. We find that several residues involved in AGE crosslinks are within key collagen domains, such as binding sites for integrins, proteoglycans and collagenase, hence providing molecular-level explanations of previous experimental results showing decreased collagen affinity for key molecules. Altogether, these findings reveal the molecular mechanism by which glycation affects the biological properties of collagen tissues, which in turn contribute to age- and diabetes-related pathological states.",

     "abstract": "Until now, no biological tools have been available to determine if a cross-linked collagen fibrillar network derived entirely from type IIA procollagen isoforms, can form in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cartilage. Recently, homozygous knock-in transgenic mice (Col2a1+\u00a0ex2, ki/ki) were generated that exclusively express the IIA procollagen isoform during post-natal development while type IIB procollagen, normally present in the ECM of wild type mice, is absent. The difference between these Col2a1 isoforms is the inclusion (IIA) or exclusion (IIB) of exon 2 that is alternatively spliced in a developmentally regulated manner. Specifically, chondroprogenitor cells synthesize predominantly IIA mRNA isoforms while differentiated chondrocytes produce mainly IIB mRNA isoforms. Recent characterization of the Col2a1+\u00a0ex2 mice has surprisingly shown that disruption of alternative splicing does not affect overt cartilage formation. In the present study, biochemical analyses showed that type IIA collagen extracted from ki/ki mouse rib cartilage can form homopolymers that are stabilized predominantly by hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (HP) cross-links at levels that differed from wild type rib cartilage. The findings indicate that mature type II collagen derived exclusively from type IIA procollagen molecules can form hetero-fibrils with type XI collagen and contribute to cartilage structure and function. Heteropolymers with type XI collagen also formed. Electron microscopy revealed mainly thin type IIA collagen fibrils in ki/ki mouse rib cartilage. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of purified type XI collagen revealed a heterotrimeric molecular composition of \u03b11(XI)\u03b12(XI)\u03b11(IIA) chains where the \u03b11(IIA) chain is the IIA form of the \u03b13(XI) chain. Since the N-propeptide of type XI collagen regulates type II collagen fibril diameter in cartilage, the retention of the exon 2-encoded IIA globular domain would structurally alter the N-propeptide of type XI collagen. This structural change may subsequently affect the regulatory function of type XI collagen resulting in the collagen fibril and cross-linking differences observed in this study.",

     "abstract": "Latent transforming growth factor-beta-1 binding protein-2 (LTBP-2) is a protein of ill-defined function associated with elastic fibers during elastinogenesis. Although LTBP-2 binds fibrillin-1, fibulin-5, and heparin/heparan sulfate, molecules critical for normal elastic fiber assembly, it does not interact directly with elastin or its precursor, tropoelastin. We investigated the modulating effect of LTBP-2 on two key interactions of tropoelastin during elastinogenesis a) with fibulin-5 and b) with heparan sulfate (using heparin). Firstly, using solid phase assays we showed that LTBP-2 bound fibulin-5 (Kd\u00a0=\u00a026.47\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.68\u00a0nM) with an affinity similar to that of the tropoelastin-fibulin-5 interaction (Kd\u00a0=\u00a024.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.64\u00a0nM). Then using a competitive binding assay we showed that LTBP-2 inhibited the tropoelastin-fibulin-5 interaction in a dose dependent manner with almost complete inhibition obtained with 5-fold molar excess of LTBP-2. Interestingly, a fragment of LTBP-2 containing the fibulin-5 binding sequence only partially inhibited the tropoelasin-fibulin-5 interaction suggesting that LTBP-2 was directly blocking only the C-terminal tropoelastin binding site on fibulin-5 and indirectly blocking tropoelastin binding to the N-terminal region. In parallel experiments heparin was shown to have minor inhibitory effects on fibulin-5 interactions with tropoelastin and LTBP-2. However, LTBP-2 was shown to significantly inhibit the binding of heparin to tropoelastin with 50% inhibition achieved with 10 fold molar excess of LTBP-2. Confocal microscopy of fibroblast matrix showed strong co-distribution of LTBP-2 with fibulin-5 and fibrillin-1 and partial co-distribution with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, perlecan and syndecan-4. Also addition of exogenous LTBP-2 to ear cartilage chondrocyte cultures blocked elastinogenesis in a concentration-dependent manner. Overall the results indicate that LTBP-2 may have a negative regulatory role during elastic fiber assembly, perhaps in displacing elastin microassemblies from complexes with fibulin-5 and/or cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans.",

     "abstract": "Extracellular matrix (ECM) conformation is regulated by a variety of stimuli in vivo, including mechanical forces and allosteric binding partners, and these conformational changes contribute to the regulation of cell behavior. Heparin and heparan sulfate, for example, have been shown to regulate the sequestration and presentation of numerous growth factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor, on the heparin 2 binding domain in fibronectin (Fn). However, mechanical force also alters Fn conformation, indicating that the growth factor binding region may be co-regulated by both heparin and mechanical force. Herein, we describe a simple antibody-based method for evaluating the conformation of the heparin 2 binding domain in Fn, and use it to determine the relative contributions of heparin and mechanical strain to the regulation of Fn conformation. We achieved specificity in quantifying conformational changes in this region of Fn by measuring the ratio of two fluorescent monoclonal antibodies, one that is insensitive to Fn conformational changes and a second whose binding is reduced or enhanced by non-equilibrium conformational changes. Importantly, this technique is shown to work on Fn adsorbed on surfaces, single Fn fibers, and Fn matrix fibers in cell culture. Using our dual antibody approach, we show that heparin and mechanical strain co-regulate Fn conformation in matrix fibrils, which is the first demonstration of heparin-dependent regulation of Fn in its physiologically-relevant fibrillar state. Furthermore, the dual antibody approach utilizes commercially available antibodies and simple immunohistochemistry, thus making it accessible to a wide range of scientists interested in Fn mechanobiology.",

However, in-depth characterization of the specific effects of MSCs on their microenvironments is needed to realize their full therapeutic potentials. Furthermore, since MSCs of varying properties can be isolated from a diverse spectrum of tissues, a strategic and rational approach in MSC sourcing for a particular application has yet to be achieved. For example, MSCs that activate their proteolytic environments may promote tissue remodeling, while those from different tissue sources may inhibit proteases and promote tissue stabilization. This study attempts to address these issues by analyzing MSCs isolated from three adult tissue sources in terms of their effects on their proteolytic microenvironments. Human bone marrow, adipose, and traumatized muscle derived MSCs were compared in their soluble and cellular-associated MMP components and activity. For all types of MSCs, MMP activity associated with the cell surface, but activity levels and MMP profiles differed with tissue source. All MSC types bound exogenous active MMPs at their surfaces. MSCs were also able to activate exogenous proMMP-2 and proMMP-13. This is in marked contrast to the MSC soluble compartment, which strongly inhibited MMPs via endogenous TIMPs. The exact TIMP used to inhibit the exogenous MMP differed with MSC type. Thus, MSCs saturate their environment with both MMPs and TIMPs. Since they bind and activate MMPs at their surfaces, the net result is a very controlled pericellular localization of MMP activities by MSCs.",

     "abstract": "Type II collagen is the major collagenous component of the cartilage extracellular matrix; formation of a covalently cross-linked type II collagen network provides cartilage with important tensile properties. The Col2a1 gene is encoded by 54 exons, of which exon 2 is subject to alternative splicing, resulting in different isoforms named IIA, IIB, IIC and IID. The two major procollagen protein isoforms are type IIA and type IIB procollagen. Type IIA procollagen mRNA contains exon 2 and is generated predominantly by chondroprogenitor cells and other non-cartilaginous tissues. Differentiated chondrocytes generate type IIB procollagen, devoid of exon 2. Although type IIA procollagen is produced in certain non-collagenous tissues during development, this developmentally-regulated alternative splicing switch to type IIB procollagen is restricted to cartilage cells. Though a much studied and characterized molecule, the importance of the various type II collagen protein isoforms in cartilage development and homeostasis is still not completely understood. Effective antibodies against specific epitopes of these isoforms can be useful tools to decipher function. However, most type II collagen antibodies to date recognize either all isoforms or the IIA procollagen isoform. To specifically identify the murine type IIB procollagen, we have generated a rabbit antibody (termed IIBN) directed to a peptide sequence that spans the murine exon 1\u20133 peptide junction. Characterization of the affinity-purified antibody by western blotting of collagens extracted from wild type murine cartilage or cartilage from Col2a1+\u00a0ex2 knock-in mice (which generates predominantly the type IIA procollagen isoform) demonstrated that the IIBN antibody is specific to the type IIB procollagen isoform. IIBN antibody was also able to detect the native type IIB procollagen in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the wild type growth plate, but not in those of the Col2a1+\u00a0ex2 homozygous knock-in mice, by both immunofluorescence and immunohistochemical studies. Thus the IIBN antibody will permit an in-depth characterization of the distribution of IIB procollagen isoform in mouse skeletal tissues. In addition, this antibody will be an important reagent for characterizing mutant type II collagen phenotypes and for monitoring type II procollagen processing and trafficking.",

     "abstract": "Collagen type I is an extracellular matrix protein found in connective tissues such as tendon, ligament, bone, skin, and the cornea of the eyes, where it functions to provide tensile strength; it also serves as a scaffold for cells and other extracellular matrix components. A single collagen type I molecule is composed of three amino acid chains that form a triple helix for most of the molecule's length; non-triple-helical extensions called N- and C-telopeptides are located at the amino/N-terminal and carboxy/C-terminal ends of the molecule, respectively. In two of the three chains, the C-telopeptide has been reported to possess a hair-pin/hook conformation, while the three N-telopeptides display a more extended structure. These telopeptides are crucial for the formation of enzymatic covalent crosslinks that form in collagens near their N- and C-ends. Such crosslinks provide structural integrity, strength, and stiffness to collagenous tissues. However, deformation mechanisms of N- and C-crosslinks and functional roles for the N- and C-telopeptide conformations are not yet well known. By performing molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that two dehydro-hydroxylysino-norleucine crosslinks, positioned at the N- and C-crosslinking sites, exhibited a two-stage response to the mechanical deformation of their parent molecules. We observed that the N-crosslink served as the first responder to mechanical deformation, followed by the C-crosslink. The results of our simulations suggest a mechanical recruitment mechanism for N- and C-crosslinks. Understanding this mechanism will be crucial for the development of larger-scale predictive models of the mechanical behavior of native collagenous tissues, engineered tissues, and collagen-based materials.",

We further report in vitro experiments clarifying both the effect of myofibroblast differentiation on this expression and the effect of extracellular elastin on myofibroblast differentiation.Lung fibrosis was induced in female C57Bl/6 mice by bleomycin instillation. Animals were sacrificed at zero to five weeks after fibrosis induction. Collagen synthesized during the week prior to sacrifice was labeled with deuterium. After sacrifice, lung tissue was collected for determination of new collagen formation, microarray analysis, and histology. Human lung fibroblasts were grown on tissue culture plastic or BioFlex culture plates coated with type I collagen or elastin, and stimulated to undergo myofibroblast differentiation by 0\u201310\u00a0ng/ml transforming growth factor (TGF)\u03b21. mRNA expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR.New collagen formation during bleomycin-induced fibrosis was highly correlated to gene expression of elastin, type V collagen and tenascin C. At the protein level, elastin, type V collagen and tenascin C were highly expressed in fibrotic areas as seen in histological sections of the lung. Type V collagen and tenascin C were transiently increased. Human lung fibroblasts stimulated with TGF\u03b21 strongly increased gene expression of elastin, type V collagen and tenascin C. The extracellular presence of elastin increased gene expression of the myofibroblastic markers \u03b1 smooth muscle actin and type I collagen.The extracellular matrix composition changes dramatically during the development of lung fibrosis. The increased levels of elastin, type V collagen and tenascin C are probably the result of increased expression by fibroblastic cells; reversely, elastin influences myofibroblast differentiation. This suggests a reciprocal interaction between fibroblasts and the extracellular matrix composition that could enhance the development of lung fibrosis.",

This hypothesis is in stark contrast to reports in literature that indicated that individually mechanical loading or cross-linking each retards enzymatic degradation of collagen substrates.

While activation of DDRs by extracellular matrix collagens is required for normal development and tissue homeostasis, aberrant activation of these receptors following injury or in disease is detrimental. The availability of mice lacking DDRs has enabled us to identify key roles played by these receptors in disease initiation and progression. DDR1 promotes inflammation in atherosclerosis, lung fibrosis and kidney injury, while DDR2 contributes to osteoarthritis. Furthermore, both DDRs have been implicated in cancer progression. Yet the mechanisms whereby DDRs contribute to disease progression are poorly understood. In this review we highlight the mechanisms whereby DDRs regulate two important processes, namely inflammation and tissue fibrosis. In addition, we discuss the challenges of targeting DDRs in disease. Selective targeting of these receptors requires understanding of how they interact with and are activated by extracellular matrix, and whether their cellular function is dependent on or independent of receptor kinase activity.",

Osterix expression has also been described in non-skeletal tissues but functional analyses are lacking. In the present study, we show that in the teleost model medaka, osterix is present as two alternatively spliced transcripts, osx_tv1 and osx_tv2. Knock-down of osx_tv1 and/or osx_tv2 results in mineralization loss in early intramembranous bones while cartilage formation is mostly unaffected. Formation of the parasphenoid, the earliest mineralized bone in the medaka skeleton, is impaired and fails to recover at later stages. Ossification of later bones, such as the operculum and cleithrum, is delayed but recovers during further development. In the axial skeleton, formation of the neural arches and centra is strongly delayed. In vivo analyses using osterix:nlGFP and osteocalcin:GFP transgenic medaka and whole mount in situ hybridization suggest that bone defects observed after knock-down of osterix are caused by a delay of osteoblast maturation and activity. Furthermore, we analyzed expression profile and function of osterix during ear and otolith formation. We show that osterix is expressed in otic placodes at the otic vesicle stage and that its knock-down results in a loss of otoliths. Taken together, we show that osterix is required for bone formation in a teleost fish and that its important regulatory functions are conserved between teleosts and mammals.

Elastin, fibulin-4, fibulin-5 and latent transforming growth factor-\u03b2-binding protein 4 are secreted proteins which form elastic fibers and are involved in the sequestration and subsequent activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2). Proteins within the second group, localized to the secretory pathway, perform transport and membrane trafficking functions necessary for the modification and secretion of elastic fiber components. Key proteins include a subunit of the vacuolar-type proton pump, which ensures the efficient secretion of tropoelastin, the precursor or elastin. A copper transporter is required for the activity of lysyl oxidases, which crosslink collagen and elastin. A Rab6-interacting goglin recruits kinesin motors to Golgi-vesicles facilitating the transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. The Rab and Ras interactor 2 regulates the activity of Rab5, a small guanosine triphosphatase essential for the endocytosis of various cell surface receptors, including integrins. Proteins of the third group related to CL perform metabolic functions within the mitochondria, inhibiting the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Two of these proteins catalyze subsequent steps in the conversion of glutamate to proline. The third transports dehydroascorbate into mitochondria.

     "abstract": "During tendon development collagen fibrillogenesis occurs in extracellular micro-domains defined by the tenocytes. This permits cellular regulation of the extracellular steps involved in the tissue-specific matrix assembly required for function. The hypothesis tested here is that collagen V associates with the tenocyte surface where it functions in regulation of collagen assembly and cell-directed fibril deposition. The in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that collagen V is a quantitatively minor component of the tendon. It is preferentially localized on the tenocyte surface as distinct foci in tendons and in cell culture. In vitro data indicate that this interaction with the tenocyte is not HSPG GAG-dependent. Collagen V is present as the mature, processed form, is absent from the media, and is a significant part of the detergent-insoluble cell layer, presumably as part of a membrane-associated complex. In contrast, procollagen I is not efficiently processed and is found predominantly in the culture media. Our data suggest that the regulatory role of collagen V requires collagen V to occupy a different cellular niche from the structural collagen I. In monolayer cultures, the conversion to the tissue form of collagen V and its deposition with the cell layer suggest efficient engagement of procollagen V with pericellular receptors and processing enzymes. The secretion of collagen I into the media and inefficient processing of procollagen I suggest reduced accessibility to these pericellular molecules due to disengagement from the cell surface. This all points to differential spatial localization of collagen V as a mechanism to optimize its regulatory roles during the cell-surface directed steps in tendon collagen fibril assembly.",

Based on our recent observations of a new subrupture, overload-induced mode of fibril disruption that we call discrete plasticity, we have sought in the current study to re-explore whether the tensile overload of collagen fibrils can alter the helical conformation of collagen molecules. In order to accomplish this, we have analyzed the conformation of collagen molecules within repeatedly overloaded tendons in relation to their undamaged matched-pair controls using both differential scanning calorimetry and variable temperature trypsin digestion susceptibility. We find that tensile overload reduces the specific enthalpy of denaturation of tendons, and increases their susceptibility to trypsin digestion, even when the digestion is carried out at temperatures as low as 4\u00a0\u00b0C. Our results indicate that the tensile overload of collagen fibrils can uncoil the helix of collagen molecules, placing them in a stable, denatured state.",

Recently, heterozygous missense mutations in KIF22, a gene which encodes a member of the kinesin-like protein family, have been identified in sporadic as well as familial cases of SEMDJL2. In the present study homozygosity mapping and whole-exome sequencing were combined to analyze a consanguineous family with a phenotype resembling SEMDJL2. We identified homozygous missense mutations in the two nearby genes NIN (Ninein) and POLE2 (DNA polymerase epsilon subunit B) which segregate with the disease in the family and were not present in 500 healthy control individuals and in the 1094 control individuals contained within the 1000-genomes database. We present several lines of evidence that mutant Ninein is most likely causative for the SEMDJL2-like phenotype. The centrosomal protein NIN shows a functional relationship with KIF22 and other proteins associated with chromosome congression/movement, centrosomal function, and ciliogenesis, which have been associated with skeletal dysplasias. Moreover, compound heterozygous missense mutations at more N-terminal positions of Ninein have very recently been identified in a family with microcephalic primordial dwarfism. Together with the present report this strongly supports a fundamental role of Ninein in skeletal development.",

The present study investigated the interaction between these two important cytokines on function of human CF and their differentiation to myofibroblasts (CMF). CF were isolated from human atrial appendage and exposed to IL-1\u03b1 and/or TGF\u03b21 (both 0.1\u00a0ng/ml). mRNA expression levels of selected genes were determined after 6\u201324\u00a0h by real-time RT-PCR, while protein levels were analyzed at 24\u201348\u00a0h by ELISA or western blot. Activation of canonical signaling pathways (NF\u03baB, Smad3, p38 MAPK) was determined by western blotting. Differentiation to CMF was examined by collagen gel contraction assays. Exposure of CF to IL-1\u03b1 alone enhanced levels of IL-6, IL-8, matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) and collagen III (COL3A1), but reduced the CMF markers \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF/CCN2). By contrast, TGF\u03b21 alone had minor effects on IL-6, IL-8 and MMP3 levels, but significantly increased levels of the CMF markers \u03b1SMA, CTGF, COL1A1 and COL3A1. Co-stimulation with both IL-1\u03b1 and TGF\u03b21 increased MMP3 expression synergistically. Furthermore, while TGF\u03b21 had no effect on IL-1\u03b1-induced IL-6 or IL-8 levels, co-stimulation inhibited the TGF\u03b21-induced increase in \u03b1SMA and blocked the gel contraction caused by TGF\u03b21. Combining IL-1\u03b1 and TGF\u03b21 had no apparent effect on their canonical signaling pathways. In conclusion, IL-1\u03b1 and TGF\u03b21 act synergistically to stimulate MMP3 expression in CF.

For many years elastin was considered to serve a solely structural role but is now being increasingly identified as causal in cell signaling, development and repair. We introduced tropoelastin into an in vitro model in which airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) were stimulated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 to examine the modulatory effect of this modular elastin sequence on release of angiogenic factors and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Human ASMCs were presented to surfaces coated with tropoelastin or collagen and controls, then stimulated with TGF-\u03b21. Transcript levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were quantified 4 and 24\u00a0h after TGF-\u03b21 stimulation. Protein VEGF release from cells and CTGF sequestered at cell surfaces were measured by ELISA at 24 and 48\u00a0h. TGF-\u03b21 increased VEGF mRNA 2.4 fold at 4\u00a0h and 5 fold at 24\u00a0h, accompanied by elevated cognate protein release 3 fold at 24\u00a0h and 2.5 fold at 48\u00a0h. TGF-\u03b21 stimulation increased CTGF mRNA 6.9 fold at 4\u00a0h and 11.8 fold at 24\u00a0h, accompanied by increased sequestering of its protein counterpart 1.2 fold at 24\u00a0h and 1.4 fold at 48\u00a0h. Pre-incubation of cells with tropoelastin did not modulate VEGF or CTGF mRNA expression, but combined with TGF-\u03b21 stimulation it led to enhanced VEGF release 5.1-fold at 24\u00a0h and 4.4-fold at 48\u00a0h. Pre-incubation with tropoelastin decreased CTGF sequestering 0.6-fold at 24 and 48\u00a0h, and increased MMP-2 production. Collagen pre-incubation under the same conditions displayed no effect on TGF-\u03b21 stimulation apart from a slightly decreased (0.9 fold) sequestered CTGF at 48\u00a0h. As CTGF is known to anchor VEGF to the matrix and inhibit its angiogenic activity, a process which can be reversed by digestion with MMP-2, these findings reveal that elastin sequences can disrupt the balance of angiogenic factors, with implications for aberrant angiogenesis. The results suggest a model of molecular crosstalk and support an active role for elastin in vascular remodeling.",

In this study, 3D collagen gels were polymerized into tensile test specimens in the presence of decorin proteoglycan, decorin core protein, or dermatan sulfate (DS). Collagen fibrillogenesis, ultrastructure, and mechanical properties were then quantified using a turbidity assay, 2 forms of microscopy (SEM and confocal), and tensile testing. The presence of decorin proteoglycan or core protein decreased the rate and ultimate turbidity during fibrillogenesis and decreased the number of fibril aggregates (fibers) compared to control gels. The addition of decorin and core protein increased the linear modulus by a factor of 2 compared to controls, while the addition of DS reduced the linear modulus by a factor of 3. Adding decorin after fibrillogenesis had no effect, suggesting that decorin must be present during fibrillogenesis to increase the mechanical properties of the resulting gels. These results show that the inclusion of decorin proteoglycan during fibrillogenesis of type I collagen increases the modulus and tensile strength of resulting collagen gels. The increase in mechanical properties when polymerization occurs in the presence of the decorin proteoglycan is due to a reduction in the aggregation of fibrils into larger order structures such as fibers and fiber bundles.",

Tissue samples of early stages of human disease are not readily available and it is difficult to identify changes in collagen content, since standard collagen analyses do not distinguish between \u2018old\u2019 and \u2018new\u2019 collagen. Therefore, the current study aimed to (i) investigate the dynamics of new collagen formation in mice using bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in which newly synthesized collagen was labeled with deuterated water and (ii) use this information to identify genes and processes correlated to new collagen formation.Lung fibrosis was induced in female C57Bl/6 mice by bleomycin instillation. Animals were sacrificed at 1 to 5\u00a0weeks after fibrosis induction. Collagen synthesized during the week before sacrifice was labeled with deuterium by providing mice with deuterated drinking water. After sacrifice, we collected lung tissue for microarray analysis, determination of new collagen formation, and histology. Furthermore, we measured in vitro the expression of selected genes after transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b21-induced myofibroblast differentiation.Deuterated water labeling showed a strong increase in new collagen formation already during the first week after fibrosis induction and a complete return to baseline at five weeks. Correlation of new collagen formation data with gene expression data allowed us to create a gene expression signature of fibrosis within the lung and revealed fibrosis-specific processes, among which proliferation. This was confirmed by measuring cell proliferation and collagen synthesis simultaneously using deuterated water incorporation in a separate experiment. Furthermore, new collagen formation strongly correlated with gene expression of e.g. elastin, Wnt-1 inducible signaling pathway protein 1, tenascin C, lysyl oxidase, and type V collagen. Gene expression of these genes was upregulated in vitro in fibroblasts stimulated with TGF\u03b21.Together, these data demonstrate, using a novel combination of technologies, that the core process of fibrosis, i.e. the formation of new collagen, correlates not only with a wide range of genes involved in general extracellular matrix production and modification but also with cell proliferation. The observation that the large majority of the genes which correlated with new collagen formation also were upregulated during TGF\u03b21-induced myofibroblast differentiation provides further evidence for their involvement in fibrosis.",

     "abstract": "Highly mineralized tooth enamel develops from an extracellular matrix chiefly comprised of amelogenins formed by splicing of 7 (human) or 9 (rodent) exons secreted from specialized epithelial cells known as ameloblasts. Here we examined the role of the 59 amino acid alternatively spliced amelogenin known as leucine rich amelogenin peptide (LRAP) on enamel formation, using transgenic murine models in which LRAP overexpression is driven by an amelogenin promoter (TgLRAP). Beginning in the secretory stage of mouse amelogenesis, we found a reduced thickness of enamel matrix and a loss of Tomes' processes, followed by upregulated amelogenin mRNA expression, inhibited amelogenin secretion and loss of cell polarity. In the presecretory stage (P0) amelogenin m180 mRNA expression was increased 58 fold along with a 203 fold increase in MMP-20 expression and 3.5 and 3.2 fold increased in respectively enamelin and ameloblastin. When LRAP was overexpressed on an amelogenin knockout mouse model, the ameloblasts were not affected. Further, expression of the global chromatin organizer and transcription factor SATB1 was reduced in secretory stage TgLRAP ameloblasts. These findings identify a cellular role for LRAP in enamel formation that is not directly related to directing enamel crystal formation as is reported to be the primary function of full length amelogenins. The effect of LRAP overexpression in upregulating amelogenins, MMP-20 and SATB1, suggests a role in protein regulation critical to ameloblast secretion and matrix processing, to form a mineralized enamel matrix.",

A participation of extracellular, isolated chondrocalcin in mineralization was proposed more than 25\u00a0years ago, but never demonstrated. Here, exogenous chondrocalcin was found to trigger MMP13 secretion and cartilage destruction ex vivo in human cartilage explants and did so by modulating the expression of interleukin-1\u03b2 in primary chondrocyte cultures in vitro. Chondrocalcin was found internalized by chondrocytes. Uptake was found mediated by a single 18-mer peptide of chondrocalcin, which does not exhibit homology to any known cell-penetrating peptide. The isolated peptide, when artificially linked as a tetramer, inhibited gene expression regulation by chondrocalcin, suggesting a functional link between uptake and gene expression regulation. At the same time, the tetrameric peptide potentiated chondrocalcin uptake by chondrocytes, suggesting a cooperative mechanism of entry. The corresponding peptide from type I pro-collagen supported identical cell-penetration, suggesting that this property may be conserved among C-propeptides of fibrillar pro-collagens. Structural modeling localized this peptide to the tips of procollagen C-propeptide trimers.

Every tissue has an ECM with unique composition and topology that governs the process of determination, differentiation, proliferation, migration and regeneration of cells. Little is known about the structural organization of matrix especially of MSC-derived adipogenic ECM. Here, we particularly focus on the composition and architecture of the fat ECM to understand the cellular behavior on functional bases. Thus, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) were adipogenically differentiated, then, were transferred to adipogenic propagation medium, whereas they started the release of lipid droplets leaving bare network of ECM. Microarray analysis was performed, to indentify the molecular machinery of matrix. Adipogenesis was verified by Oil Red O staining of lipid droplets and by qPCR of adipogenic marker genes PPARG and FABP4.

In the adipogenic matrix, the hexagonal structures were abundant followed by octagonal structures, whereas they interwoven in a crisscross manner. Regarding molecular machinery of adipogenic ECM, the bioinformatics analysis revealed the upregulated expression of COL4A1, ITGA7, ITGA7, SDC2, ICAM3, ADAMTS9, TIMP4, GPC1, GPC4 and downregulated expression of COL14A1, ADAMTS5, TIMP2, TIMP3, BGN, LAMA3, ITGA2, ITGA4, ITGB1, ITGB8, CLDN11. Moreover, genes associated with integrins, glycoproteins, laminins, fibronectins, cadherins, selectins and linked signaling pathways were found.

The almost ubiquitous regulation of CCN2 by TGF-\u03b2, including that seen in the disc, emphasizes the importance of the TGF-\u03b2\u2013CCN2 relationship, especially in terms of extracellular matrix synthesis. Likewise, the unique cross-talk between CCN2 and HIF-1 in the disc highlights the tissue and niche specific mode of regulation.

Better understanding of the mechanisms resulting in fibrosis is essential for developing appropriate treatment solutions and is therefore of upmost importance. Recent evidence suggests a significant antifibrotic potential of an integral membrane protein, caveolin-1. While caveolin-1 has been widely studied for its role in the regulation of cell signaling and endocytosis, its possible implication in fibrosis remains largely unclear. In this review we survey involvement of caveolin-1 in various cellular processes and highlight different aspects of its antifibrotic activity. We hypothesize that caveolin-1 conveys a homeostatic function in the process of fibrosis by (a) regulating TGF-\u03b21 and its downstream signaling; (b) regulating critical cellular processes involved in tissue repair, such as migration, adhesion and cellular response to mechanical stress; and (c) antagonizing profibrotic processes, such as proliferation. Finally, we consider this homeostatic function of caveolin-1 as a possible novel approach in treatment of fibroproliferative diseases.",

     "abstract": "Thrombospondin-1 is a potent suppressor of T cell activation via its receptor CD47. However, the precise mechanism for this inhibition remains unclear. Because H2S is an endogenous potentiator of T cell activation and is necessary for full T cell activation, we hypothesized that thrombospondin-1 signaling through CD47 inhibits T cell activation by antagonizing H2S signaling. Primary T cells from thrombospondin-1 null mice were more sensitive to H2S-dependent activation assessed by proliferation and induction of interleukin-2 and CD69 mRNAs. Exogenous thrombospondin-1 inhibited H2S responses in wild type and thrombospondin-1 null T cells but enhanced the same responses in CD47 null T cells. Fibronectin, which shares integrin and glycosaminoglycan binding properties with thrombospondin-1 but not CD47 binding, did not inhibit H2S signaling. A CD47-binding peptide derived from thrombospondin-1 inhibited H2S-induced activation, whereas two other functional sequences from thrombospondin-1 enhanced H2S signaling. Therefore, engaging CD47 is necessary and sufficient for thrombospondin-1 to inhibit H2S-dependent T cell activation. H2S stimulated T cell activation by potentiating MEK-dependent ERK phosphorylation, and thrombospondin-1 inhibited this signaling in a CD47-dependent manner. Thrombospondin-1 also limited activation-dependent T cell expression of the H2S biosynthetic enzymes cystathionine \u03b2-synthase and cystathionine \u03b3-lyase, thereby limiting the autocrine role of H2S in T cell activation. Thus, thrombospondin-1 signaling through CD47 is the first identified endogenous inhibitor of H2S signaling and constitutes a novel mechanism that negatively regulates T cell activation.",

Excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins and altered cytokine levels in the dermal collagen matrix are common to several pathological situations such as localized scleroderma and systemic sclerosis, keloids, dermatosclerosis associated with venous ulcers and the fibroproliferative tissue surrounding invasively growing tumors. Which factors contribute to altered organization of dermal collagen matrix in skin fibrosis is not well understood. We recently demonstrated that cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) functions as organizer of the dermal collagen I network in healthy human skin (Agarwal et al., 2012). Here we show that COMP deposition is enhanced in the dermis in various fibrotic conditions. COMP levels were significantly increased in fibrotic lesions derived from patients with localized scleroderma, in wound tissue and exudates of patients with venous leg ulcers and in the fibrotic stroma of biopsies from patients with basal cell carcinoma. We postulate enhanced deposition of COMP as one of the common factors altering the supramolecular architecture of collagen matrix in fibrotic skin pathologies. Interestingly, COMP remained nearly undetectable in normally healing wounds where myofibroblasts transiently accumulate in the granulation tissue. We conclude that COMP expression is restricted to a fibroblast differentiation state not identical to myofibroblasts which is induced by TGF\u03b2 and biomechanical forces.",

Type VIII collagen, a short chain collagen, is scarcely present in normal arteries, but is dramatically upregulated in atherosclerosis and after other types of vascular injury. Cell culture studies have revealed that this protein supports smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion and stimulates migration, however little is known about the signaling or the mechanisms by which this occurs. SMCs isolated from wild-type C57BL/6 and type VIII collagen deficient mice were studied using assays to measure chemotactic and haptotactic migration, and remodeling and contraction of 3-dimensional type I collagen gels. Col8\u2212/\u2212 SMCs exhibited impairments in migration, and a strongly adhesive phenotype with prominent stress fibers, stable microtubules and pronounced central basal focal adhesions. The addition of exogenous type VIII collagen to the Col8\u2212/\u2212 SMCs rescued the impairments in migration, and restored cytoskeletal architecture so that it was similar to Col8+/+ cells. We measured elevated levels of active GTP-RhoA in the Col8\u2212/\u2212 cells, and this too was reversed by treatment with exogenous type VIII collagen. We showed that type VIII collagen normally suppresses RhoA activation through a beta-1 integrin dependent mechanism. MMP-2 levels were reduced in the Col8\u2212/\u2212 SMCs, and knockdown of MMP-2 in Col8+/+ SMCs partially recapitulated the decreases in migration and 3D gel contraction seen in Col8\u2212/\u2212 cells, showing that type VIII collagen-stimulated migration was dependent on MMP-2. Inhibition of Rho restored MMP-2 activity in the Col8\u2212/\u2212 cells, and partially rescued migration, demonstrating that the elevations in RhoA activity were responsible for the suppression of migration of these cells. In conclusion, we have shown that type VIII collagen signals through beta-1 integrin receptors to suppress RhoA, allowing optimal configuration of the cytoskeleton, and the stimulation of MMP-2-dependent cell migration.",

     "abstract": "Asynchronous concurrent lactation (ACL) is an extreme lactation strategy in macropod marsupials including the tammar wallaby, that may hold the key to understanding local control of mammary epithelial cell function. Marsupials have a short gestation and a long lactation consisting of three phases; P2A, P2B and P3, representing early, mid and late lactation respectively and characterised by profound changes in milk composition. A lactating tammar is able to concurrently produce phase 2A and 3 milk from adjacent glands in order to feed a young newborn and an older sibling at heel. Physiological effectors of ACL remain unknown and in this study the extracellular matrix (ECM) is investigated for its role in switching mammary phenotypes between phases of tammar wallaby lactation. Using the level of expression of the genes for the phase specific markers tELP, tWAP, and tLLP-B representing phases 2A, 2B and 3 respectively we show for the first time that tammar wallaby mammary epithelial cells (WallMECs) extracted from P2B acquire P3 phenotype when cultured on P3 ECM. Similarly P2A cells acquire P2B phenotype when cultured on P2B ECM. We further demonstrate that changes in phase phenotype correlate with phase-specific changes in ECM composition. This study shows that progressive changes in ECM composition in individual mammary glands provide a local regulatory mechanism for milk protein gene expression thereby enabling the mammary glands to lactate independently.",

They enwrap a subset of GABAergic inhibitory interneurons in the cerebral cortex and restrict experience-dependent cortical plasticity. While the expression profile of PNN components has been widely studied in many areas of the central nervous system of various animal species, it remains unclear how these components are expressed during the postnatal development of mouse primary visual cortex (V1). In the present study, we characterized the developmental time course of the formation of PNNs in the mouse primary visual cortex, using the specific antibodies against the two PNN component proteins aggrecan and tenascin-R, or the lectin Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) that directly binds to glycosaminoglycan chains of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs). We found that the fluorescence staining signals of both the WFA staining and the antibody against aggrecan rapidly increased in cortical neurons across layers 2\u20136 during postnatal days (PD) 10\u201328 and reached a plateau around PD42, suggesting a full construction of PNNs by the end of the critical period. Co-staining with antibodies to Ca2\u00a0+ binding protein parvalbumin (PV) demonstrated that the majority of PNN-surrounding cortical neurons are immunoreactive to PV. Similar expression profile of another PNN component tenascin-R was observed in the development of V1. Dark rearing of mice from birth significantly reduced the density of PNN-surrounding neurons. In addition, the expression of two recently identified CSPG receptors \u2014 Nogo receptor (NgR) and leukocyte common antigen-related phosphatase (LAR), showed significant increases from PD14 to PD70 in layer 2\u20136 of cortical PV-positive interneurons in normal reared mice, but decreased significantly in dark-reared ones. Taken together, these results suggest that PNNs form preferentially in cortical PV-positive interneurons in an experience-dependent manner, and reach full maturation around the end of the critical period of V1 development.",

Heparanase is an enzyme that cleaves heparan sulfate polysaccharide into smaller fragments, regulating the functions of heparan sulfate. Understanding the substrate specificity plays a critical role in dissecting the biological functions of heparanase and heparan sulfate. The prevailing view is that heparanase recognizes specific sulfation patterns in heparan sulfate.

     "abstract": "Heparanase (Hpse) is an endo-\u03b2-d-glucuronidase that degrades the glycosaminoglycan heparan sulfate (HS) in basement membranes (BMs) to facilitate leukocyte migration into tissues. Heparanase activity also releases HS-bound growth factors from the extracellular matrix (ECM), a function that aids wound healing and angiogenesis. In disease states, the degradation of HS in BMs by heparanase is well recognized as an invasive property of metastatic cancer cells. Recent studies by our group, however, have identified unexpected new roles for heparanase and HS. First, we discovered that in Type 1 diabetes (T1D) (i) HS in the pancreatic islet BM acts as a barrier to invading cells and (ii) high levels of HS within the insulin-producing islet beta cells themselves are critical for beta cell survival, protecting the cells from free radical-mediated damage. Furthermore, catalytically active heparanase produced by autoreactive T cells and other insulitis mononuclear cells was shown to degrade intra-islet HS, increasing the susceptibility of islet beta cells to free radical damage and death. This totally novel molecular explanation for the onset of T1D diabetes opens up new therapeutic approaches for preventing disease progression. Indeed, administration of the heparanase inhibitor, PI-88, dramatically reduced T1D incidence in diabetes-prone NOD mice, preserved islet beta cell HS and reduced islet inflammation. Second, in parallel studies it has been shown that heparanase and HS can be transported to the nucleus of cells where they impact directly or indirectly on gene transcription. Based on ChIP-on-chip studies heparanase was found to interact with the promoters and transcribed regions of several hundred genes and micro-RNAs in activated Jurkat T cells and up-regulate transcription, with many of the target genes/micro-RNAs being involved in T cell differentiation. At the molecular level, nuclear heparanase appears to regulate histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation by influencing the recruitment of demethylases to transcriptionally active genes. These studies have unveiled new functions for heparanase produced by T lymphocytes, with the enzyme mediating unexpected intracellular effects on T cell differentiation and insulin-producing beta cell survival in T cell-dependent autoimmune T1D.",

Notably, current data show that in addition to its well characterized role in cancer, heparanase activity may represent an important determinant in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory disorders, such as inflammatory lung injury, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic colitis. Nevertheless, the precise mode of heparanase action in inflammatory reactions remains largely unclear and recent observations suggest that heparanase can either facilitate or limit inflammatory responses, when tissue/cell-specific contextual cues may dictate an outcome of heparanase action in inflammation. In this review the involvement of heparanase in modulation of inflammatory reactions is discussed through a few illustrative examples, including neuroinflammation, sepsis-associated lung injury and inflammatory bowel disease. We also discuss possible action of the enzyme in coupling inflammation and tumorigenesis in the setting of inflammation-triggered cancer.",

Blood vessels are highly active structures whose morphology rapidly adapts to maintain vascular function under altered systemic and local conditions. In some pathologies (restenosis, thrombosis, atherosclerosis) this normally beneficial adaptation may be detrimental to overall function. Enzymatic dependent and independent effects of heparanase on arterial structure mechanics and repair closely regulate arterial compliance and neointimal proliferation following endovascular stenting. Additionally, heparanase promotes thrombosis after vascular injury and contributes to a pro-coagulant state in human carotid atherosclerosis. Importantly, heparanase is closely associated with development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques, including stable to unstable plaque transition. Consequently, heparanase levels are markedly increased in the plasma of patients with acute myocardial infarction. Noteworthy, heparanase activates macrophages, resulting in marked induction of cytokine expression associated with plaque progression towards vulnerability.

     "abstract": "Mouse and human genetic data suggests that Wnt5a is required for jaw development but the specific role in facial skeletogenesis is unknown. We mapped expression of WNT5A in the developing chicken skull and found that the highest expression was in early Meckel's cartilage but by stage 35 expression was decreased to background. We focused on chondrogenesis by targeting a retrovirus expressing WNT5A to the mandibular prominence prior to cell differentiation. Unexpectedly, there were no phenotypes in the first 6\u00a0days following injection; however later the mandibular bones and Meckel's cartilage were reduced or missing on the treated side. To examine the effects on cartilage differentiation we treated micromass cultures from mandibular mesenchyme with Wnt5a-conditioned media (CM). Similar to in vivo viral data, cartilage differentiates normally, but, after 6\u00a0days of culture, nearly all Alcian blue staining is lost. Collagen II and aggrecan were also decreased in treated cultures. The matrix loss was correlated with upregulation of metalloproteinases, MMP1, MMP13, and ADAMTS5 (codes for Aggrecanase). Moreover, Marimastat, an MMP and Aggrecanase inhibitor rescued cartilage matrix in Wnt5a-CM treated cultures. The pathways mediating these cartilage and RNA changes were investigated using luciferase assays. Wnt5a-CM was a potent inhibitor of the canonical pathway and strongly activated JNK/PCP signaling. To determine whether the matrix loss is mediated by repression of canonical signaling or activation of the JNK pathway we treated mandibular cultures with either DKK1, an antagonist of the canonical pathway, or a small molecule that antagonizes JNK signaling (TCS JNK 6o). DKK1 slightly increased cartilage formation and therefore suggested that the endogenous canonical signaling represses chondrogenesis. To test this further we added an excess of Wnt3a-CM and found that far fewer cartilage nodules differentiated. Since DKK1 did not mimic the effects of Wnt5a we excluded the canonical pathway from mediating the matrix loss phenotype. The JNK antagonist partially rescued the Wnt5a phenotype supporting this non-canonical pathway as the main mediator of the cartilage matrix degradation. Our study reveals two new roles for WNT5A in development and disease: 1) to repress canonical Wnt signaling in cartilage blastema in order to promote normal differentiation and 2) in conditions of excess to stimulate degradation of mature cartilage matrix via non-canonical pathways.",

Increased ECM synthesis and deposition, coupled with reduced ECM breakdown contribute to the elevated ECM level in CKD.Previous pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that increased plasmin activity has a beneficial effect in the protein overload model of CKD. As plasmin activation is downregulated by the action of the thrombin activated fibrinolytic inhibitor (TAFI), we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of TAFI might increase plasmin activity and reduce ECM accumulation in an in vitro model of glucose induced ECM expansion. Treatment of NRK52E tubular epithelial cells with increasing concentrations of glucose resulted in a 40% increase in TAFI activity, a 38% reduction in plasmin activity and a subsequent increase in ECM accumulation. In this model system, application of the previously reported TAFI inhibitor UK-396082 [(2S)-5-amino-2-[(1-n-propyl-1H-imidazol-4-yl)methyl]pentanoic acid] caused a reduction in TAFI activity, increased plasmin activity and induced a parallel decrease in ECM levels. In contrast, RNAi knockdown of plasmin resulted in an increase in ECM levels.The data presented here indicate that high glucose induces TAFI activity, inhibiting plasmin activation which results in elevated ECM levels in tubular epithelial cells. The results support the hypothesis that UK-396082 is able to reduce TAFI activity, normalising plasmin activity and preventing excess ECM accumulation suggesting that TAFI inhibition may have potential as an anti-scarring strategy in CKD.",

ADAMTS-4 is synthesized as a latent pro-enzyme that requires the removal of the pro-domain, exposing the N-terminal neoepitope, to achieve activity. We developed a monoclonal antibody against this neoepitope of active ADAMTS-4. Furthermore, we established and characterized a competitive ELISA for measuring active ADAMTS-4 form applying the specific antibody. We used this assay to profile the presence of active ADAMTS-4 and its aggrecan degradation product (NITEGE373) in a bovine cartilage ex vivo model. We found that after stimulation with catabolic factors, the cartilage initially released high levels of aggrecanase-derived aggrecan fragments into supernatant but subsequently decreased to background levels. The level of active ADAMTS-4 released into the supernatant and retained in the cartilage matrix increased continuously throughout the 21\u00a0days of the study. The activity of ADAMTS-4 on the last day of catabolic stimulation was verified in vitro by adding deglycosylated or native aggrecan to the conditioned medium. Samples of human cartilage affected by varying degrees of osteoarthritis stained strongly for active ADAMTS-4 where surface fibrillation and clustered chondrocytes were observed.

In vitro assays indicated that acurhagin-C not only may influence the cell viability at higher concentration, but also can potently and dose-dependently decrease cell proliferation in murine B16-F10 melanoma. Otherwise, it also had a dose-dependent inhibition on B16-F10 cell adhesion to extracellular matrices, collagen VI, gelatin B and fibronectin, as well as disturbed transendothelial migration of B16-F10 cell.

The glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan and its receptor, CD44, are implicated in the initiation and progression of a mouse model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Digestion of hyaluronan tethered to brain vascular endothelial cells by a hyaluronidase blocks the slow rolling of lymphocytes along activated brain vascular endothelial cells and delays the onset of EAE. These effects could be due to the elimination of hyaluronan or the generation of hyaluronan digestion products that influence lymphocytes or endothelial cells. Here, we found that hyaluronan dodecasaccharides impaired activated lymphocyte slow rolling on brain vascular endothelial cells when applied to lymphocytes but not to the endothelial cells. The effects of hyaluronan dodecasaccharides on lymphocyte rolling were independent of CD44 and a receptor for degraded hyaluronan, Toll-like receptor-4. Subcutaneous injection of hyaluronan dodecasaccharides or tetrasaccharides delayed the onset of EAE in a manner similar to subcutaneous injection of hyaluronidase. Hyaluronan oligosaccharides can therefore act directly on lymphocytes to modulate the onset of inflammatory demyelinating disease.",

     "abstract": "Connective tissue aging and diabetes related comorbidity are associated with compromised tissue function, increased susceptibility to injury, and reduced healing capacity. This has been partly attributed to collagen cross-linking by advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that accumulate with both age and disease. While such cross-links are believed to alter the physical properties of collagen structures and tissue behavior, existing data relating AGEs to tendon mechanics is contradictory. In this study, we utilized a rat tail tendon model to quantify the micro-mechanical repercussion of AGEs at the collagen fiber-level. Individual tendon fascicles were incubated with methylglyoxal (MGO), a naturally occurring metabolite known to form AGEs. After incubation in MGO solution or buffer only, tendons were stretched on the stage of a multiphoton confocal microscope and individual collagen fiber stretch and relative fiber sliding were quantified. Treatment by MGO yielded increased fluorescence and elevated denaturation temperatures as found in normally aged tissue, confirming formation of AGEs and related cross-links. No apparent ultrastructural changes were noted in transmission electron micrographs of cross-linked fibrils. MGO treatment strongly reduced tissue stress relaxation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), with concomitantly increased tissue yield stress (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and ultimate failure stress (p\u00a0=\u00a00.036). MGO did not affect tangential modulus in the linear part of the stress\u2013strain curve (p\u00a0=\u00a00.46). Microscopic analysis of collagen fiber kinematics yielded striking results, with MGO treatment drastically reducing fiber-sliding (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) with a compensatory increase in fiber-stretch (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). We thus conclude that the main mechanical effect of AGEs is a loss of tissue viscoelasticity driven by matrix-level loss of fiber\u2013fiber sliding. This has potentially important implications to tissue damage accumulation, mechanically regulated cell signaling, and matrix remodeling. It further highlights the importance of assessing viscoelasticity \u2013 not only elastic response \u2013 when considering age-related changes in the tendon matrix and connective tissue in general.",

     "abstract": "The osteophyte associated with osteoarthritis (OA) is a bony outgrowth formed at the margins of the affected joint through endochondral ossification-like processes. However, the mechanism of osteophyte formation and its pathogenesis are unclear. Perlecan (Hspg2), a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is expressed in many extracellular tissues and plays critical roles in skeletal development and diseases. The aim of the present study is to identify the role of synovial perlecan in osteophyte formation using perinatal lethality rescued perlecan-knockout mice (Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg) wherein perlecan expression is lacking in the synovial and other tissues, except for cartilage. We analyzed the development of osteophytes in joints of Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice in two different animal models: the surgical OA model, in which the medial collateral ligament was transected and the medial meniscus was resected, and the TGF-\u03b2-induced osteophyte formation model. In the surgical OA model, the osteophyte size and maturation were significantly reduced in the OA joints of Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice compared with control mice, while OA developed on the medial side of the knee joints with no differences in the cartilage degradation score or synovitis score between control and Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice. The reduced osteophyte formation in Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice was associated with reduced cell proliferation and chondrogenesis. In the TGF-\u03b2 model, the osteophyte size and maturation were also significantly reduced in Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice compared with control mice. Our findings suggest that synovial perlecan plays an important role in osteophyte development in OA, and they provide insights that may facilitate the development of OA therapy.",

Nephronectin has been shown to interact with \u03b18\u03b21 integrin through the central linker segment, but its interactions with other molecules remain to be elucidated. Here, we examined the binding of nephronectin to a panel of glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains. Nephronectin bound strongly to heparin and chondroitin sulfate (CS)-E and moderately to heparan sulfate (HS), but failed to bind to CS-A, CS-C, CS-D, dermatan sulfate and hyaluronic acid. Deletion of the MAM domain severely impaired the binding of nephronectin to heparin but not CS-E, whereas deletion of the EGF-like repeats reduced its binding to CS-E but not heparin, suggesting that nephronectin interacts with CS-E and heparin through the EGF-like repeats and MAM domain, respectively. Consistent with these results, nephronectin bound to agrin and perlecan, which are heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in basement membranes, in HS-dependent manners. Site-directed mutagenesis of the MAM domain revealed that multiple basic amino acid residues in the putative loop regions were involved in the binding of the MAM domain to agrin. The binding of nephronectin to basement membrane HSPGs was further confirmed by in situ nephronectin overlay assays using mouse frozen tissue sections. Taken together, these findings indicate that nephronectin is capable of binding to HSPGs in basement membranes via the MAM domain, and thereby raise the possibility that interactions with basement membrane HSPGs may be involved in the deposition of nephronectin onto basement membranes.",

Further, immunofluorescence staining and quantitative proteomic analysis of the inner limiting membrane (ILM), a BM of the retina, revealed that laminin-111 and nidogen-1 were reduced in POMGnT1 knockout mice. Finally, atomic force microscopy showed that the ILM from POMGnT1 knockout mice was thinner with an altered surface topography.

Western blotting confirmed these changes at the protein level. In contrast, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) did not modulate CCN2 expression and had only a modest stimulatory effect on TNC levels.

In contrast, multiple signaling pathways (p38, JNK, PI3K/Akt and NF\u03baB) contributed to IL-1\u03b1-induced TNC expression. In conclusion, IL-1\u03b1 reduced CCN2 expression and increased TNC expression in human CF.

     "abstract": "Collagen XVI, by structural analogy a member of the FACIT- (fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices) family of collagens, is described as a minor collagen component of connective tissues. Collagen XVI is expressed in various cells and tissues without known occurrence of splice variants or isoforms. For skin and cartilage tissues its suprastructure is known. Presumably, there it acts as an adaptor protein connecting and organizing large fibrillar networks and thus modulates integrity and stability of the extracellular matrix (ECM).Collagen XVI is produced by myofibroblasts in the normal intestine and its synthesis is increased in the inflamed bowel wall where myofibroblasts develop increased numbers of focal adhesion contacts on collagen XVI. Consequently, recruitment of \u03b11 integrin into the focal adhesions at the tip of the cells is induced followed by increased cell spreading on collagen XVI. This presumably adds to the maintenance of myofibroblasts in the inflamed intestinal regions and thus promotes fibrotic responses of the tissue. Notably, \u03b11/\u03b12 integrins interact with collagen XVI through an \u03b11/\u03b12\u03b21 integrin binding site located in the COL 1\u20133 domains.Collagen XVI may act as a substrate for adhesion and invasion of connective tissue tumor cells. In glioblastoma it induces tumor invasiveness by modification of the \u03b21-integrin activation pattern. Thus, altering the cell\u2013matrix interaction through collagen XVI might be a molecular mechanism to further augment the invasive phenotype of glioma cells. In this line, in oral squamous cell carcinoma collagen XVI expression is induced which results in an upregulation of Kindlin-1 followed by an increased interaction with beta1-integrin. Consequently, collagen XVI induces a proliferative tumor phenotype by promoting an early S-phase entry.In summary, collagen XVI plays a decisive role in the interaction of connective tissue cells with their ECM, which is impaired in pathological situations. Alteration of tissue location and expression level of collagen XVI appears to promote tumorigenesis and to perpetuate inflammatory reactions.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA molecules that are made up of 18\u201325 nucleotides that function in post-transcriptional gene regulation. The expression of miRNAs is highly conserved and essential in regulating many cellular processes including formation, maintenance and the remodelling of the extracellular matrix (ECM). In this review, we examine different ECM molecules and the miRNAs involved in regulating their abundance and how these changes influence cell phenotype. For example, miRNAs and their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are involved in cell adhesion, by regulating the synthesis and turnover of key ECM adhesion molecules and their receptors including cadherins, integrins and other non-integrin ECM receptors. Other miRNAs regulate the abundance of cytokines and growth factors which in turn stimulate cells to synthesize and secrete specialized ECMs. For example, miR-125a/b and miR-146a and their downstream target mRNAs influence the production of the epidermal growth factor family which has a significant impact on the nature of the ECM formed. miRNAs affect structural ECM proteins important in the assembly, composition and organization of the ECM. Proteins such as collagen, fibronectin, versican, and nephronectin are targeted by several miRNAs. miRNAs can also control the expression of proteins such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs), which are involved in ECM remodelling and are important for tissue development, cell motility and wound healing. It has become clear that many different miRNAs control the balance in ECM composition that determines normal tissue function and alterations in the expression of these miRNAs can lead to pathological consequences.",

Of particular importance is the cytokine\u2013governed elastin regulatory axis in which the pro-elastogenic activities of transforming growth factor \u03b2-1 (TGF\u03b21) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are opposed by anti-elastogenic activities of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF/FGF-2), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), EGF, PDGF-BB, TGF\u03b1, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and noncanonical TGF\u03b21 signaling. A key mechanistic feature of the regulatory axis is that cytokines influence elastin formation through effects on the cell cycle involving control of cyclin\u2013cyclin dependent kinase complexes and activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. In this article we provide an overview of the major cytokines/growth factors that modulate elastogenesis and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms for their action on elastin production.",

     "abstract": "The components that comprise the extracellular matrix (ECM) are integral to normal tissue homeostasis as well as the development and progression of breast tumors. The secretion, construction, and remodeling of the ECM are each regulated by a complex interplay between tumor cells, fibroblasts and macrophages. Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) is an essential molecule in regulating the cellular production of ECM molecules and the adhesive interactions of cells with the ECM. Additionally, hypoxic cell signals, initiated by oxygen deprivation, additional metabolic factors or receptor activation, are associated with ECM formation and the progression of breast cancer. Both TGF-\u03b2 and hypoxic cell signals are implicated in the functional and morphological changes of cancer-associated-fibroblasts and tumor-associated-macrophages. Moreover, the enhanced recruitment of tumor and stromal cells in response to hypoxia-induced chemokines leads to increased ECM deposition and remodeling, increased blood vessel formation, and enhanced tumor migration. Thus, elucidation of the collaborative networks between tumor and stromal cells in response to the combined signals of TGF-\u03b2 and hypoxia may yield insight into treatment parameters that target both tumor and stromal cells.",

The role that extracellular matrix components, mainly collagen, proteoglycans, and collagen cross-links, play in determining the mechanical behavior of tendon will be examined in this review. Specifically, collagen fiber re-alignment and collagen fibril uncrimping relate mechanical behavior to structural alterations during development and during healing. Finally, attention is paid to a number of recent efforts to augment injured tendon and how future efforts could focus on recreating the important structure\u2013function relationships reviewed here.",

Importantly, increases in MAGP2 positively correlate with poor prognosis for some ovarian cancers. It has been assumed that full-length MAGP2 is responsible for all reported effects; however, here we show MAGP2 is a substrate for the proprotein convertase (PC) family of endoproteases. Proteolytic processing of MAGP2 by PC cleavage could serve to regulate secretion and thus, activity and function as reported for other extracellular and cell-surface proteins. In support of this idea, MAGP2 contains an evolutionarily conserved PC consensus cleavage site, and amino acid sequencing of a newly identified MAGP2 C-terminal cleavage product confirmed functional PC cleavage. Additionally, mutagenesis of the MAGP2 PC consensus cleavage site or treatment with PC inhibitors prevented MAGP2 proteolytic processing. Finally, both cleaved and uncleaved MAGP2 were detected extracellularly and MAGP2 secretion appeared independent of PC cleavage, suggesting that PC processing occurs mainly outside the cell. Our characterization of alternative forms of MAGP2 present in the extracellular space not only enhances diversity of this ECM protein but also provides a previously unrecognized molecular mechanism for regulation of MAGP2 biological activity.",

     "abstract": "Reversibility of aberrant methylation via pharmacological means is an attractive target for therapies through epigenetic reprogramming. To establish that pharmacologic reversal of methylation could result in functional inhibition of angiogenesis, we undertook in vitro and in vivo studies of thrombospondin-1 (TSP1), a known inhibitor of angiogenesis. TSP1 is methylated in several malignancies, and can inhibit angiogenesis in melanoma xenografts. We analyzed effects of 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dC) on melanoma cells in vitro to confirm reversal of promoter hypermethylation and restoration of TSP1 expression. We then investigated the effects of TSP1 expression on new blood vessel formation and tumor growth in vivo. Finally, to determine potential for clinical translation, the methylation status of TSP1 promoter regions of nevi and melanoma tissues was investigated.5-Aza-dC reduced DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) protein, reversed promoter hypermethylation, and restored TSP1 expression in five melanoma cell lines, while having no effect on TSP1 protein levels in normal human melanocytes. In in vivo neovascularization studies, mice were implanted with melanoma cells (A375) either untreated or treated with 5Aza-dC. Vessels at tumor sites were counted by an observer blinded to treatments and the number of tumor vessels was significantly decreased at pretreated tumor sites. This difference occurred before a significant difference in tumor volumes was seen, yet in further studies the average tumor volume in mice treated in vivo with 5-Aza-dC was decreased by 55% compared to untreated controls. Knockdown of TSP1 expression with shRNA enhanced tumor-induced angiogenesis by 68%. Analyses of promoter methylation status of TSP1 in tumors derived from untreated and treated mice identified 67% of tumors from untreated and 17% of tumors from treated mice with partial methylation consistent with the methylation specific PCR analysis of A375 cells. Examination of methylation patterns in the promoter of TSP1 and comparison of aberrantly methylated TSP1 in melanoma with non-malignant nevi identified a significantly higher frequency of promoter methylation in tumor samples from melanoma patients.Pharmacological reversal of methylation silenced TSP1 had functional biological consequences in enhancing angiogenesis inhibition and inducing antitumor effects to decrease murine melanoma growth. Angiogenesis inhibition is an additional mechanism by which epigenetic modulators can have antitumor effects.",

     "abstract": "Patients with aortic stenosis develop various degrees of myocardial hypertrophy and heart failure (HF) despite comparable transvalvular gradients. An important element in the transition from compensated hypertrophy to HF is dilatation of the left ventricle (LV). The molecular pathology associated with LV dilatation and development of HF is not known. Thus, we examined potential differences in the regulation of myocardial extracellular matrix (ECM) constituents in mice with hypertrophy only (ABnonHF) and with HF (ABHF) as response to comparable pressure overload. The ascending aorta was banded, or left loose in sham-operated mice. Increased lung weight and left atrial diameter indicating pulmonary congestion were used to identify ABHF mice. Cardiac function and geometry were evaluated by echocardiography. Despite comparable pressure gradients and cardiac output, ABHF had reduced fractional shortening (23%), reduced systolic (28%) and diastolic (32%) tissue velocity and increased LV internal dimension in diastole (10%) and systole (17%) (LVIDd/s) compared to ABnonHF (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Microarray analyses identified 120 differently regulated genes related to ECM in ABHF compared to ABnonHF (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). Interestingly, in ABHF, we found a 24% (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) reduction of the LV collagen VIII protein levels despite increased levels of LV total collagen by 23% (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05). LV collagen VIII correlated negatively with LVIDd (R\u00a0=\u00a00.55, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and LVIDs (R\u00a0=\u00a00.72, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).

     "abstract": "The aging population is at an increased risk of tendon injury and tendinopathy. Elucidating the molecular basis of tendon aging is crucial to understanding the age-related changes in structure and function in this vulnerable tissue. In this study, the structural and functional features of tendon aging are investigated. In addition, the roles of decorin and biglycan in the aging process were analyzed using transgenic mice at both mature and aged time points. Our hypothesis is that the increase in tendon injuries in the aging population is the result of altered structural properties that reduce the biomechanical function of the tendon and consequently increase susceptibility to injury. Decorin and biglycan are important regulators of tendon structure and therefore, we further hypothesized that decreased function in aged tendons is partly the result of altered decorin and biglycan expression. Biomechanical analyses of mature (day 150) and aged (day 570) patellar tendons revealed deteriorating viscoelastic properties with age. Histology and polarized light microscopy demonstrated decreased cellularity, alterations in tenocyte shape, and reduced collagen fiber alignment in the aged tendons. Ultrastructural analysis of fibril diameter distributions indicated an altered distribution in aged tendons with an increase of large diameter fibrils. Aged wild type tendons maintained expression of decorin which was associated with the structural and functional changes seen in aged tendons. Aged patellar tendons exhibited altered and generally inferior properties across multiple assays. However, decorin-null tendons exhibited significantly decreased effects of aging compared to the other genotypes. The amelioration of the functional deficits seen in the absence of decorin in aged tendons was associated with altered tendon fibril structure. Fibril diameter distributions in the decorin-null aged tendons were comparable to those observed in the mature wild type tendon with the absence of the subpopulation containing large diameter fibrils. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for age-dependent alterations in tendon architecture and functional activity, and further show that lack of stromal decorin attenuates these changes.",

Modulation of the extracellular matrix by immune-derived proteases can alter endothelial cell\u2013matrix interactions as well as endothelial cell sprouting, migration and capillary formation. Granzyme B is a serine protease that is expressed by a variety of immune cells, and accumulates in the extracellular milieu in many chronic inflammatory disorders that are associated with dysregulated angiogenesis. Although granzyme B is known to cleave fibronectin, an essential glycoprotein in vascular morphogenesis, the role of granzyme B in modulating angiogenesis is unknown. In the present study, granzyme B cleaved both plasma fibronectin and cell-derived fibronectin, resulting in the release of multiple fibronectin fragments. Granzyme B cleavage of fibronectin resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in endothelial cell adhesion to fibronectin as well as reduced endothelial cell migration and tubular formation. These events were prevented when granzyme B activity was inhibited by a small molecule inhibitor. In summary, granzyme B-mediated cleavage of fibronectin contributes to attenuated angiogenesis through the disruption of endothelial cell \u2014 fibronectin interaction resulting in impaired endothelial cell migration and tubular formation.",

Further, we tested the possible roles of DPT in CFs adhesion, spreading, migration and proliferation, which greatly promote the ventricular remodeling process after MI. Results showed that hypoxia/SD stimulated DPT expression and secretion in CMs and CFs and that DPT promoted adhesion, spreading and migration of CFs whereas had no effect on CFs proliferation. In addition, functional blocking antibodies specific for integrin \u03b13 and \u03b21 significantly reduced CFs adhesion and migration that DPT induced, suggesting that integrin \u03b13\u03b21 is at least one receptor for CFs adhesion and migration to DPT.

The 67-residue full-length PIVL sequence was deduced from a venom gland cDNA clone. Structurally, PIVL is built by a single Kunitz/BPTI-like domain. Functionally, it is able to specifically inhibit trypsin activity. Interestingly, PIVL exhibits an anti-tumor effect and displays integrin inhibitory activity without being cytotoxic. Here we show that PIVL is able to dose-dependently inhibit the adhesion, migration and invasion of human glioblastoma U87 cells.

     "abstract": "An innovative approach to enhance the selectivity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors comprises targeting these inhibitors to catalytically required substrate binding sites (exosites) that are located outside the catalytic cleft. In MMP-2, positioning of collagen substrate molecules occurs via a unique fibronectin-like domain (CBD) that contains three distinct modular collagen binding sites. To characterize the contributions of these exosites to gelatinolysis by MMP-2, seven MMP-2 variants were generated with single, or concurrent double and triple alanine substitutions in the three fibronectin type II modules of the CBD. Circular dichroism spectroscopy verified that recombinant MMP-2 wild-type (WT) and variants had the same fold. Moreover, the MMP-2 WT and variants had the same activity on a short FRET peptide substrate that is hydrolyzed independently of CBD binding. Among single-point variants, substitution in the module 3 binding site had greatest impact on the affinity of MMP-2 for gelatin. Simultaneous substitutions in two or three CBD modules further reduced gelatin binding. The rates of gelatinolysis of MMP-2 variants were reduced by 20\u201340% following single-point substitutions, by 60\u201375% after double-point modifications, and by >\u00a090% for triple-point variants. Intriguingly, the three CBD modules contributed differentially to cleavage of dissociated \u03b1-1(I) and \u03b1-2(I) collagen chains. Importantly, kinetic analyses (kcat/Km) revealed that catalysis of a triple-helical FRET peptide substrate by MMP-2 relied primarily on the module 3 binding site. Thus, we have identified three collagen binding site residues that are essential for gelatinolysis and constitute promising targets for selective inhibition of MMP-2.",

Previously, we observed that mechanical signaling was attenuated in leiomyoma, but the mechanisms responsible remain unclear. Integrins, especially integrin \u03b21, are transmembrane adhesion receptors that couple extracellular matrix stresses to the intracellular cytoskeleton to influence cell proliferation and differentiation. Here we characterized integrin and laminin to signaling in leiomyoma cells. We observed a 2.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.32 fold increased expression of integrin \u03b21 in leiomyoma cells, compared to myometrial cells. Antibody-mediated inhibition of integrin \u03b21 led to significant growth inhibition in leiomyoma cells and a loss of cytoskeletal integrity. Specifically, polymerization of actin filaments and formation of focal adhesions were reduced by inhibition of integrin \u03b21. Inhibition of integrin \u03b21 in leiomyoma cells led to 0.81\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02 fold decrease in active RhoA, and resembled levels found in serum-starved cells. Likewise, inhibition of integrin \u03b21 was accompanied by a decrease in phospho-ERK. Compared to myometrial cells, leiomyoma cells demonstrated increased expression of integrin \u03b16 subunit to laminin receptor (1.91\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11 fold), and increased expression of laminin 5\u03b1 (1.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.02), laminin 5\u03b2 (3.06\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92), and laminin 5\u03b3 (1.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06). Of note, leiomyoma cells grown on laminin matrix appear to realign themselves.

     "abstract": "During skeletal development, the onset of chondrogenic differentiation is marked by expression of the \u03b11(II) procollagen (Col2a1) gene. Exon 2 of Col2a1 codes for a cysteine-rich von Willebrand factor C-like domain. Chondroprogenitors express the exon 2-containing IIA and IID splice forms by utilizing adjacent 5\u2032 splice sites separated by 3 base pairs. There is a shift to expression of the shorter, exon 2-lacking IIB splice form with further differentiation. Alternative splicing analysis of Col2a1 splice forms has often relied upon semi-quantitative PCR, using a single set of PCR primers to amplify multiple splice forms. We show that this widely used method is inaccurate due to mismatched amplification efficiency of different-sized PCR products. We have developed the TaqMan\u00ae-based AT-qPCR (Alternative Transcript-qPCR) assay to more accurately quantify alternatively spliced mRNA, and demonstrate the measurement of Col2a1 splice form expression in differentiating ATDC5 cells in vitro, and in wild type mouse embryonic and postnatal cartilage in vivo. The AT-qPCR assay is based on the use of a multiple-amplicon standard (MAS) plasmid, containing a chemically synthesized cluster of splice site-spanning PCR amplicons, to quantify alternative splice forms by standard curve-based qPCR. The MAS plasmid designed for Col2a1 also contained an 18S rRNA amplicon for sample normalization, and an amplicon corresponding to a region spanning exon 52\u201353 to measure total Col2a1 mRNA. In mouse E12.5 to P70 cartilages, we observed the expected switch between the IIA and IIB splice forms; no IID or IIC splice products were observed. However, in the ATDC5 cultures, predominant expression of the IIA and IID splice forms was found at all times in culture. Additionally, we observed that the sum of the IIA, IIB and IID splice forms comprises only a small fraction of Col2a1 transcripts containing the constitutive exon 52\u201353 junction. We conclude from our results that the majority of ATDC5 cells in the assay described in this study remained as chondroprogenitors during culture in standard differentiation conditions, and that additional Col2a1 transcripts may be present. The validity of this novel AT-qPCR assay was confirmed by demonstrating the expected Col2a1 isoform expression patterns in vivo in developing mouse cartilage. The ability to measure true levels of procollagen type II splice forms will provide better monitoring of chondrocyte differentiation in other model systems. In addition, the AT-qPCR assay described here could be applied to any gene of interest to detect and quantify known and predicted alternative splice forms and can be scaled up for high throughput assays.",

     "abstract": "Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF/CCN2) is an important mediator of kidney fibrosis. Previous observations indicated that attenuation of CCN2 expression sufficed to alleviate early kidney damage. However, little is known about the role of CCN2 in fibrosis of severely damaged and more chronically injured kidneys. Therefore, we examined the effects of CCN2 haploinsufficiency on the progression of renal scarring in long-term STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, in a more advanced stage of obstructive nephropathy following unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO), and in severe aristolochic acid (AA)-induced tubulotoxic nephritis.Wild-type (WT, CCN2+/+) and hemizygous CCN2+/\u2212 C57Bl/6 mice were studied. In the diabetes experiment, streptozotocin-injected and control mice were followed for 6\u00a0months, with regular blood pressure, glycaemia and albuminuria recordings. In the UUO experiment, the left ureter was obstructed for 14\u00a0days with the contralateral kidney serving as control. For the AA experiment, mice were followed for 25\u00a0days after 5 intraperitoneal injections with AA and compared to control mice injected with buffer alone. Organs were harvested for histology, mRNA and protein measurements. Collagen content was determined by HPLC and expressed as hydroxyproline/proline ratio.CCN2 expression was significantly increased in the damaged as compared to control kidneys. In all three models, CCN2 levels in the damaged kidneys of CCN2+/\u2212 mice averaged about 50% of those in damaged WT kidneys. After 6\u00a0months of diabetes, albuminuria was increased 2.5-fold in WT mice, compared to 1.5-fold in CCN2+/\u2212 mice, mesangial matrix was expanded 5-fold in WT and 4.4-fold in CCN2+/\u2212 mice and the glomerular basement membrane was thickened 1.3-fold in WT and 1.5-fold in CCN2+/\u2212 mice (all differences between WT and CCN2+/\u2212 mice are NS). Tubular damage and interstitial fibrosis scores were also not different between Wt and CCN2+/\u2212 mice in the diabetes (1.8 vs. 1.7), UUO (2.8 vs. 2.6), and AA (1.4 vs. 1.2) models, as was the case for macrophage influx and collagen content in these three models.Unlike in mild and relatively early STZ-induced diabetic nephropathy, scarring of severely and chronically damaged kidneys is not attenuated by a 50% reduction of CCN2 to (near) normal levels. This suggests that CCN2 is either redundant in severe and chronic kidney disease, or that it is a limiting factor only at subnormal concentrations requiring further reduction by available or emerging therapies to prevent fibrosis of the severely injured kidney.",

While the PCM is often defined by the presence of type VI collagen, other macromolecules such as perlecan, a heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan, are also exclusively localized to the PCM in normal cartilage and likely contribute to PCM structural integrity and biomechanical properties. Though perlecan is essential for normal cartilage development, its exact role in the PCM is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the biomechanical role of perlecan in the articular cartilage PCM in situ and its potential as a defining factor of the PCM. To this end, atomic force microscopy (AFM) stiffness mapping was combined with dual immunofluorescence labeling of cryosectioned porcine cartilage samples for type VI collagen and perlecan. While there was no difference in overall PCM mechanical properties between type VI collagen- and perlecan-based definitions of the PCM, within the PCM, interior regions containing both type VI collagen and perlecan exhibited lower elastic moduli than more peripheral regions rich in type VI collagen alone. Enzymatic removal of HS chains from perlecan with heparinase III increased PCM elastic moduli both overall and locally in interior regions rich in both perlecan and type VI collagen. Heparinase III digestion had no effect on ECM elastic moduli. Our findings provide new evidence for perlecan as a defining factor in both the biochemical and biomechanical properties of the PCM.",

Aggrecan is required both for proper cartilage formation in development and maintenance of mature cartilage. Prominent ACAN transcription is a conserved feature of vertebrate cartilage, although little is known about its specific transcriptional regulation. We examined the genomic interval containing human ACAN for transcriptional enhancers directing expression to cartilage, using a functional assay in transgenic zebrafish. We tested 24 conserved non\u2010coding sequences, representing ~\u00a06% of the total sequence in the interval, and identified eleven independently capable of regulating reporter gene expression in cartilage. These enhancers were widely spaced, from >\u00a0100\u00a0kb upstream of the gene to within the first intron. While the majority displayed broad cartilage expression in zebrafish larvae, several were restricted to a subset of cartilage cells in the craniofacial skeleton. In older fish, the enhancers displayed differential activity; some maintained expression, either in all cartilage or preferentially in articular cartilage at the joints, while others were not active. This remarkable degree of overlapping regulatory control has been highly conserved; we identified clear orthologues of six enhancers at the chicken ACAN locus, arranged in the same order relative to the gene. These were also functional in directing expression to cartilage in transgenic zebrafish. Several enhancers contain potential binding sites for Sox9, consistent with its described role as an upstream regulator of ACAN expression. However, others lacked Sox9 consensus binding sites, implicating additional pathways and transcription factors as regulators of ACAN expression in cartilage, either in development or adult tissue. Our identification of these enhancer sequences is the necessary first step in detailed examination of the upstream regulators of ACAN expression.",

By interacting with A2AR, the purine nucleoside adenosine acts as a potent endogenous inhibitor of the inflammatory process in a variety of tissues. Hyaluronan (HA) fragments act to prime inflammation via CD44 and the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4). The aim of this study was to investigate whether the inhibition/stimulation of A2AR modulates the inflammation cascade primed by small HA fragments in mouse articular chondrocytes.6-mer HA treatment induced up-regulation of CD44, TLR4 and A2AR mRNA expression and the related protein levels, and NF-kB activation, that in turn increased TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 and production. Treatment with a selective 2A adenosine receptor agonist (2-phenylaminoadenosine) enhanced A2AR increase, as well as the inhibition of CD44 and TLR4 activity using two specific antibodies abolished up-regulation of CD44 and TLR4, and significantly reduced, especially by antibody inhibition, NF-kB activation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Furthermore, the exposure of chondrocytes to A2AR specific interference mRNA (A2AR siRNA) enhanced HA 6-mer induced NF-kB activation and inflammatory cytokine increase. Finally, the use of an exchange protein activated by cAMP (EPAC) siRNA and a specific PKA inhibitor showed a predominant EPAC involvement in the mediation of the anti-inflammatory activity exerted by A2AR stimulation.These data suggest that HA depolymerization occurring during inflammation contributes to priming of the inflammatory cascade, while endogenous adenosine, by exerting anti-inflammatory response via A2AR, could be a modulatory mechanism that attempts to attenuate the inflammation process.",

The control of FN deposition is tightly controlled by cells. Agents that modulate FN assembly may be useful therapeutically in conditions characterized by excessive FN deposition, such as fibrosis, inflammatory diseases, and malignancies. To identify such agents by high throughput screening (HTS), we developed a microtiter assay of FN deposition by human fibroblasts. The assay provides a robust read-out of FN assembly. Alexa 488-FN (A488-FN) was added to cell monolayers, and the total fluorescence intensity of deposited A488-FN was quantified. The fluorescence intensity of deposited A488-FN correlated with the presence of FN fibrils visualized by fluorescence microscopy. The assay Z\u2032 values were 0.67 or 0.54, respectively, when using background values of fluorescence either with no added A488-FN or with A488-FN added together with a known inhibitor of FN deposition. The assay was used to screen libraries comprising 4160 known bioactive compounds. Nine compounds were identified as non- or low-cytotoxic inhibitors of FN assembly. Four (ML-9, HA-100, tyrphostin and imatinib mesylate) are kinase inhibitors, a category of compounds known to inhibit FN assembly; two (piperlongumine and cantharidin) are promoters of cancer cell apoptosis; and three (maprotiline, CGS12066B, and aposcopolamine) are modulators of biogenic amine signaling. The latter six compounds have not been recognized heretofore as affecting FN assembly. The assay is straight-forward, adapts to 96- and 384-well formats, and should be useful for routine measurement of FN deposition and HTS.

Its precise functions remain to be fully elucidated though it clearly plays a critical role in the structural integrity of the extracellular matrix. Loss of collagen XV from the basement membrane zone precedes invasion of a number of tumor types and we previously showed that collagen XV functions as a dose-dependent suppressor of tumorigenicity in cervical carcinoma cells. The carboxyl terminus of another non-fibrillar collagen (XVIII) is cleaved to produce endostatin, which has anti-angiogenic effects and thus may act as a tumor suppressor in vivo. Since collagen XV has structural similarity with collagen XVIII, its C-terminal restin domain could confer tumor suppressive functions on the molecule, though our previous data did not support this. We now show that expression of collagen XV enhances the adhesion of cervical carcinoma cells to collagen I in vitro as does the N-terminus and collagenous regions of collagen XV, but not the restin domain. Destruction of a cysteine residue in the collagenous region that is critical for intermolecular interactions of collagen XV abolished the enhanced adhesion to collagen I. Finally, we demonstrate that unlike full length collagen XV, expression of the restin domain alone does not suppress tumorigenicity of cervical carcinoma cells in vivo; hence, this process is dependent on functions and interactions of other parts of the protein.",

     "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) has long been viewed primarily as an organized network of solid-phase ligands for integrin receptors. During degenerative processes, such as osteoarthritis, the ECM undergoes deterioration, resulting in its remodeling and in the release of some of its components. Matrilin-3 (MATN3) is an almost cartilage specific, pericellular protein acting in the assembly of the ECM of chondrocytes. In the past, MATN3 was found required for cartilage homeostasis, but also involved in osteoarthritis-related pro-catabolic functions. Here, to better understand the pathological and physiological functions of MATN3, its concentration as a circulating protein in articular fluids of human osteoarthritic patients was determined and its functions as a recombinant protein produced in human cells were investigated with particular emphasis on the physical state under which it is presented to chondrocytes. MATN3 down-regulated cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and up-regulated catabolism when administered as a soluble protein. When artificially immobilized, however, MATN3 induced chondrocyte adhesion via a \u03b15\u03b21 integrin-dependent mechanism, AKT activation and favored survival and ECM synthesis. Furthermore, MATN3 bound directly to isolated \u03b15\u03b21 integrin in vitro. TGF\u03b21 stimulation of chondrocytes allowed integration of exogenous MATN3 into their ECM and ECM-integrated MATN3 induced AKT phosphorylation and improved ECM synthesis and accumulation. In conclusion, the integration of MATN3 to the pericellular matrix of chondrocytes critically determines the direction toward which MATN3 regulates cartilage metabolism. These data explain how MATN3 plays either beneficial or detrimental functions in cartilage and highlight the important role played by the physical state of ECM molecules.",

Osteonectin/SPARC/BM-40 is a collagen binding matricellular protein that is enriched in bone. Its expression is increased in prostate cancer metastases, and it stimulates the migration of prostate carcinoma cells. However, the presence of osteonectin in cancer cells and the stroma may limit prostate tumor development and progression. To determine how bone matrix osteonectin affects the behavior of prostate cancer cells, we modeled prostate cancer cell-bone interactions using the human prostate cancer cell line PC-3, and mineralized matrices synthesized by wild type and osteonectin-null osteoblasts in vitro. We developed this in vitro system because the structural complexity of collagen matrices in vivo is not mimicked by reconstituted collagen scaffolds or by more complex substrates, like basement membrane extracts.Second harmonic generation imaging demonstrated that the wild type matrices had thick collagen fibers organized into longitudinal bundles, whereas osteonectin-null matrices had thinner fibers in random networks. Importantly, a mouse model of prostate cancer metastases to bone showed a collagen fiber phenotype similar to the wild type matrix synthesized in vitro. When PC-3 cells were grown on the wild type matrices, they displayed decreased cell proliferation, increased cell spreading, and decreased resistance to radiation-induced cell death, compared to cells grown on osteonectin-null matrix. Our data support the idea that osteonectin can suppress prostate cancer pathogenesis, expanding this concept to the microenvironment of skeletal metastases.",

     "abstract": "Heparin and its derivatives are known to regulate a variety of pathophysiological events related to vascular biology. In the present manuscript we examine a variety of heparinomimetics biochemically (electrophoretic behavior and enzymatic degradation) and pharmacologically (in vitro anticoagulant activity and in vivo hemorrhagic and antithrombotic tests) as well as their interactions with cells from the vessel wall using a time resolved fluorometric method and confocal microscopy. Data were determined for unfractionated heparin (UFH), enoxaparin, synthetic heparin pentasaccharide, C3 heparin derived oligosaccharides and phosphosulfomannan (PI-88). While being structurally distinct from UFH, all compounds exhibited anticoagulant, antithrombotic and hemorrhagic activities. In addition, besides the pentasaccharide, they all stimulated the synthesis of an antithrombotic heparan sulfate present at the cell surface and secreted by endothelial cells. Also, like UFH, they interacted with both endothelial and smooth muscle cells and dislodged UFH from its binding sites in a dose dependent manner but, with distinct saturable curves showing that the binding of polymeric structures to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins does not depend on a glycosaminoglycan backbone. The data also suggest a common pathway, which does not depend on the presence of the conventionally accepted antithrombin binding pentasaccharide, for ECM dependent activity of the heparinomimetic stimulated synthesis of antithrombotic heparan sulfate. Notably, although of similar molecular weight as well as polymeric backbone, the synthetic heparin pentasaccharide showed significant hemorrhagic action and negligible antithrombotic activity in a venous thrombosis model, contrasting with C3, that displayed negligible hemorrhagic effect and potent antithrombotic action. These results provide evidence that structurally unrelated polymers can elicit similar hemostatic activities and show that polymeric sequence is not always crucial for certain activities. The results also suggest that non-GAG structures may provide an alternative route for the pharmaceutical control of hemostasis.",

Degradation was inhibited by EDTA, the metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 and by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-3, but not by TIMP-1 or TIMP-2. This inhibitor profile indicates that the shed microvesicles contain aggrecanolytic ADAMTS(s) or related TIMP-3-sensitive metalloproteinase(s). The oligodendroglioma cells were shown to express the three most active aggrecanases, namely Adamts1, Adamts4 and Adamts5, suggesting that one or more of these enzymes may be responsible for the microvesicle activity. Microvesicles shed by rheumatoid synovial fibroblasts similarly degraded aggrecan in a TIMP-3-sensitive manner.

Perlecan deficiency (Hspg2\u2212/\u2212) in mice and humans causes lethal chondrodysplasia, which indicates that perlecan is essential for cartilage development. However, the function of perlecan in endochondral ossification is not clear. Here, we report the critical role of perlecan in VEGF signaling and angiogenesis in growth plate formation. The Hspg2\u2212/\u2212 growth plate was significantly wider but shorter due to severely impaired endochondral bone formation. Hypertrophic chondrocytes were differentiated in Hspg2\u2212/\u2212 growth plates; however, removal of the hypertrophic matrix and calcified cartilage was inhibited. Although the expression of MMP-13, CTGF, and VEGFA was significantly upregulated in Hspg2\u2212/\u2212 growth plates, vascular invasion into the hypertrophic zone was impaired, which resulted in an almost complete lack of bone marrow and trabecular bone. We demonstrated that cartilage perlecan promoted activation of VEGF/VEGFR by binding to the VEGFR of endothelial cells. Expression of the perlecan transgene specific to the cartilage of Hspg2\u2212/\u2212 mice rescued their perinatal lethality and growth plate abnormalities, and vascularization into the growth plate was restored, indicating that perlecan in the growth plate, not in endothelial cells, is critical in this process. These results suggest that perlecan in cartilage is required for activating VEGFR signaling of endothelial cells for vascular invasion and for osteoblast migration into the growth plate. Thus, perlecan in cartilage plays a critical role in endochondral bone formation by promoting angiogenesis essential for cartilage matrix remodeling and subsequent endochondral bone formation.",

A progressive increase in mineralization was also reflected by increased mineral-to-matrix ratio determined by FT-IRIS.

     "abstract": "Alveolar formation or alveolarization is orchestrated by a finely regulated and complex interaction between growth factors and extracellular matrix proteins. The lung parenchyma contains various extracellular matrix proteins including proteoglycans, which are composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) linked to a protein core. Although GAGs are known to regulate growth factor distribution and activity according to their degree of sulfation the role of sulfated GAG in the respiratory system is not well understood. The degree of sulfation of GAGs is regulated in part, by sulfatases that remove sulfate groups. In vertebrates, the enzyme Sulfatase-Modifying Factor 1 (Sumf1) activates all sulfatases. Here we utilized mice lacking Sumf1\u2212/\u2212 to study the importance of proteoglycan desulfation in lung development. The Sumf1\u2212/\u2212 mice have normal lungs up until the onset of alveolarization at post-natal day 5 (P5). We detected increased deposition of sulfated GAG throughout the lung parenchyma and a decrease in alveolar septa formation. Moreover, stereological analysis showed that the alveolar volume is 20% larger in Sumf1\u2212/\u2212 as compared to wild type (WT) mice at P10 and P30. Additionally, pulmonary function test was consistent with increased alveolar volume. Genetic experiments demonstrate that in Sumf1\u2212/\u2212 mice arrest of alveolarization is independent of fibroblast growth factor signaling. In turn, the Sumf1\u2212/\u2212 mice have increased transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling and in vivo injection of TGF\u03b2 neutralizing antibody leads to normalization of alveolarization. Thus, absence of sulfatase activity increases sulfated GAG deposition in the lungs causing deregulation of TGF\u03b2 signaling and arrest of alveolarization.",

We examined structural vascular changes, collagen and elastin content, vascular oxidative stress, and MMPs levels/activities during the development of 2K1C hypertension. Plasma angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity was measured to assess renin-angiotensin system activation. Sham or 2K1C hypertensive rats were studied after 2, 4, 6, and 10\u00a0weeks of hypertension. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored weekly. Morphometry of structural changes in the aortic wall was studied in hematoxylin/eosin, orcein and picrosirius red sections. Aortic NADPH activity and superoxide production was evaluated. Aortic gelatinolytic activity was determined by in situ zymography, and MMP-2, MMP-14, and tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP)-2 levels were determined by gelatin zymography, immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry. 2K1C hypertension was associated with increased ACE activity, which decreased to normal after 10\u00a0weeks. We found increased aortic collagen and elastin content in the early phase of hypertension, which were associated with vascular hypertrophy, increased vascular MMP-2 and MMP-14 (but not TIMP-2) levels, and increased gelatinolytic activity, possibly as a result of increased vascular NADPH oxidase activity and oxidative stress. These results indicate that vascular remodeling of renovascular hypertension is an early process associated with early increases in MMPs activities, enhanced matrix deposition and oxidative stress. Using antioxidants or MMPs inhibitors in the early phase of hypertension may prevent the vascular alterations of hypertension.",

A previous study reported the expression and localization of CyrA cleavage products CyrA-C45 and CyrA-C40. In this study, an N-terminal antibody was produced that detected the full-length 63\u00a0kDa protein (CyrA-C63). Western blot analyses showed that the intracellular expression of CyrA-C63 peaked between 12 and 16\u00a0h of development, consistent with the time that cells are developing into a motile, multicellular slug. CyrA immunolocalization and CyrA-GFP showed that the protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, particularly its perinuclear component. CyrA-C63 secretion began shortly after the onset of starvation peaking between 8 and 16\u00a0h of development. A pharmacological analysis showed that CyrA-C63 secretion was dependent on intracellular Ca2+ release and active CaM, PI3K, and PLA2. CyrA-C63 bound to CaM both intra- and extracellularly and both proteins were detected in the slime sheath deposited by migrating slugs. In keeping with its purported function, CyrA-GFP over-expression enhanced cAMP-mediated chemotaxis and CyrA-C45 was detected in vinculin B (VinB)-GFP immunoprecipitates, thus providing a link between the increase in chemotaxis and a specific cytoskeletal component. Finally, DdEGFL1-FITC was detected on the membranes of cells capped with concanavalin A suggesting that a receptor exists for this peptide sequence.

Thrombospondins have been grouped functionally with SPARCs, tenascins and CCN proteins as adhesion-modulating or matricellular components of the extracellular milieu. Although all these multi-domain proteins share various commonalities of domains, the grouping is not based on structural homologies. Instead, the terms emphasise the general observations that these proteins do not form large-scale ECM structures, yet act at cell surfaces and function in coordination with the structural ECM and associated extracellular proteins. The designation of adhesion-modulation thus depends on observed tissue and cell culture ECM distributions and on experimentally identified functional properties. To date, the evolutionary relationships of these proteins have not been critically compared: yet, knowledge of their evolutionary histories is clearly relevant to any consideration of functional similarities. In this article, we survey briefly the structural and functional knowledge of these protein families, consider the evolution of each family, and outline a perspective on their functional roles.",

Studies of such interactions involving thrombospondin-1 have revealed several physiological functions and roles in the pathogenesis of injury responses and cancer, but the relatively mild phenotypes of mice lacking thrombospondin-1 suggested that thrombospondin-1 would not be a central player that could be exploited therapeutically. Recent research focusing on signaling through its receptor CD47, however, has uncovered more critical roles for thrombospondin-1 in acute regulation of cardiovascular dynamics, hemostasis, immunity, and mitochondrial homeostasis. Several of these functions are mediated by potent and redundant inhibition of the canonical nitric oxide pathway. Conversely, elevated tissue thrombospondin-1 levels in major chronic diseases of aging may account for the deficient nitric oxide signaling that characterizes these diseases, and experimental therapeutics targeting CD47 show promise for treating such chronic diseases as well as acute stress conditions that are associated with elevated thrombospondin-1 expression.",

     "abstract": "Aortic valve disease (AVD) occurs in 2.5% of the general population and often requires surgical intervention. Aortic valve malformation (AVM) underlies the majority of cases, suggesting a developmental etiology. Elastin haploinsufficiency results in complex cardiovascular problems, and 20\u201345% of patients have AVM and/or AVD. Elastin insufficient (Eln+/\u2212) mice demonstrate AVM and latent AVD due to abnormalities in the valve annulus region. The objective of this study was to examine extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and biomechanical properties in regional aortic valve tissue and determine the impact of early AVM on late AVD in the Eln+/\u2212 mouse model. Aortic valve ECM composition and remodeling from juvenile, adult, and aged stages were evaluated in Eln+/\u2212 mice using histology, ELISA, immunohistochemistry and gelatin zymography. Aortic valve tissue biomechanical properties were determined using micropipette aspiration. Cartilage-like nodules were demonstrated within the valve annulus region at all stages identifying a developmental abnormality preceding AVD. Interestingly, maladaptive ECM remodeling was observed in early AVM without AVD and worsened with late AVD, as evidenced by increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression and activity, as well as abnormalities in ADAMTS-mediated versican processing. Cleaved versican was increased in the valve annulus region of aged Eln+/\u2212 mice, and this abnormality correlated temporally with adverse alterations in valve tissue biomechanical properties and the manifestation of AVD. These findings identify maladaptive ECM remodeling in functional AVM as an early disease process with a progressive natural history, similar to that seen in human AVD, emphasizing the importance of the annulus region in pathogenesis. Combining molecular and engineering approaches provides complementary mechanistic insights that may be informative in the search for new therapeutic targets and durable valve bioprostheses.",

In this review, we elucidate the influence of the pathologically altered extracellular matrix on progenitor cell behavior. Moreover, we discuss the modulation of progenitor cells especially of previously characterized chondrogenic progenitor cells (Koelling et al., 2009) in situ to enhance their regeneration potential. These options comprise the application of growth factors like fibroblast growth factor-2, a Runx-2 knock down and a contemporary anti-inflammatory therapy. This supports endogenous regeneration on behalf of the diseased osteoarthritic cartilage, which otherwise results mainly in an insufficient fibro-cartilaginous repair tissue. Furthermore, new results indicate a role of pericytes in osteoarthritis for these repair attempts. We discuss the biological mechanisms potentially leading to new therapeutic options in osteoarthritis to enhance regeneration in situ.",

     "abstract": "The present study describes the generation of a knock-in mouse model to address the role of type II procollagen (Col2a1) alternative splicing in skeletal development and maintenance. Alternative splicing of Col2a1 precursor mRNA is a developmentally-regulated event that only occurs in chondrogenic tissue. Normally, chondroprogenitor cells synthesize predominantly exon 2-containing mRNA isoforms (type IIA and IID) while Col2a1 mRNA devoid of exon 2 (type IIB) is the major isoform produced by differentiated chondrocytes. Another isoform, IIC, has also been identified that contains a truncated exon 2 and is not translated into protein. The biological significance of this IIA/IID to IIB splicing switch is not known. Utilizing a splice site targeting knock-in approach, a 4 nucleotide mutation was created to convert the 5\u2032 splice site of Col2a1 exon 2 from a weak, non-consensus sequence to a strong, consensus splice site. This resulted in apparent expression of only the IIA mRNA isoform, as confirmed in vitro by splicing of a type II procollagen mini-gene containing the 5\u2032 splice site mutation. To test the splice site targeting approach in vivo, homozygote mice engineered to retain IIA exon 2 (Col2a1+ex2) were generated. Chondrocytes from hindlimb epiphyseal cartilage of homozygote mice were shown to express only IIA mRNA and protein at all pre- and post-natal developmental stages analyzed (E12.5, E16.5, P0, P3, P7, P14, P28 and P70). As expected, type IIB procollagen was the major isoform produced in wild type cartilage at all post-natal time points. Col2a1+ex2 homozygote mice are viable, appear healthy and display no overt phenotype to date. However, research is currently underway to investigate the biological consequence of persistent expression of the exon 2-encoded conserved cysteine-rich domain in post-natal skeletal tissues.",

     "abstract": "The metabolism of hyaluronan (HA), especially its catabolism, is still far from being elucidated. Although several studies suggest that HA is degraded locally in tissues and through the lymphatic or circulatory systems, much needs to be learned about the enzymes, receptors and cell types that support this dynamic process. In the current work, the clearance of exogenously administered HA was examined in a C57BL/6 mouse model. Hyaluronidase-sensitive fluorescein-labeled 1.2\u00a0MDa hyaluronan (flHA) was administered either intravenously (i.v.) or subcutaneously (s.c.) into wild type C57BL/6 mice. Plasma was sampled for pharmacokinetic analysis and tissues were harvested for histological examination of the cell types responsible for uptake using immunofluorescent localization and for size exclusion chromatography analysis. We observed that flHA could be degraded locally in the skin or be taken up by sinusoidal cells in lymph nodes, liver and spleen. I.v. administration of flHA revealed non-linear Michaelis\u2013Menten pharmacokinetics compatible with a saturable, receptor-mediated clearance system (Km\u00a0=\u00a011.6\u00a0\u03bcg/ml\u00a0\u00b1\u00a046.0%, Vmax\u00a0=\u00a01.69\u00a0\u03bcg/ml/min\u00a0\u00b1\u00a059.7%).

     "abstract": "The ability of lymphocytes to migrate freely through connective tissues is vital to efficient immune function. How the extracellular matrix (ECM) may affect T-cell adhesion and migration is not well understood. We have examined the adhesion and migration of activated human T-lymphocytes on ECM made by fibroblast-like synoviocytes and lung fibroblasts. These cells were minimally interactive until treated with a viral mimetic, Poly I:C. This treatment promoted myofibroblast formation and engendered a higher-order structured ECM, rich in versican and hyaluronan, to which T-cells avidly adhered in a hyaluronidase-sensitive manner. This Poly I:C-induced matrix impeded T-cell spreading and migration on and through synoviocyte monolayers, while hyaluronidase treatment or adding versican antibody during matrix formation reversed the effect on T-cell migration. Hyaluronidase also reversed the spread myofibroblast morphology. These data suggest that the viscous hyaluronan- and versican-rich matrix binds and constrains T-lymphocytes. Using purified matrix components and solid state matrices of defined composition, we uncovered a role for versican in modulating hyaluronan-T-cell interactions. Versican prevented T-cell binding to soluble hyaluronan, as well as the amoeboid shape change on hyaluronan-coated dishes and T-cell penetration of collagen gels. Together, these data suggest that hyaluronan and versican play a role in T-cell trafficking and function in inflamed tissues.",

We questioned whether these effects were related to abnormal extracellular matrix (ECM)-cell adhesion. HASMCs were seeded on decorin, biglycan, collagen type I or plastic. Actin organization and focal adhesion formation were assessed by staining for filamentous (F) and globular (G) actin, and vinculin, respectively. Gene expression for focal adhesion proteins, ECM molecules and HASMC receptors was measured. Protein levels for fibronectin, \u03b12, \u03b15, \u03b1v and \u03b23 integrin subunits and, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) were assessed. F-actin filaments were prominent in cells seeded on collagen I and plastic, less apparent in cells cultured on biglycan and faint in cells on decorin. Vinculin clustering was decreased in cells seeded on decorin and biglycan, as was vinculin gene expression. Compared to cells on plastic, cells on decorin had an increase in fibronectin gene expression. Seeding on decorin caused an increase in \u03b12 integrin subunit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor A gene expression. There was also an increase in \u03b12 and \u03b1v integrin subunit protein. Finally, FAK protein levels in cells seeded on decorin or biglycan were decreased compared to cells seeded on plastic or collagen I. Cells grown on proteoglycan matrices demonstrate evidence of abnormalities during many of the key processes involved in normal cell adhesion. Upregulation of cell surface receptor proteins, such as \u03b12 integrin subunit, may represent a compensatory mechanism to overcome poor adhesion induced by growth on these matrices.",

Migration of choroidal endothelial cells was quantified in the presence of inhibitors to different EDP binding proteins. C57BL6 mice were injected with EDPs and studied by electroretinography, transmission electron microscopy, and microarray analysis.An alternatively spliced form of beta-galactosidase (GLB1) is present on human choroidal endothelial cells and acts as a receptor for EDPs. Elevated levels of circulating EDPs do not affect retinal function in the mouse, but do increase the expression and deposition of collagen IV in the RPE/choroid complex.EDPs may play a role in neovascular AMD by binding to and inducing neovascular phenotypes in choroidal endothelial cells through their receptor, GLB1. These peptides also cause an increased mRNA expression and deposition of collagen IV in the RPE/choroid, which may alter diffusion properties between the retina and choriocapillaris.",

They are important components in formation of the molecular networks of BMs as well as in cell polarity, cell differentiation and tissue morphogenesis. Each laminin is composed by an \u03b1, a \u03b2 and a \u03b3 chain. Previous studies have shown that the \u03b33 chain is partnered with either the \u03b21 chain (in placenta) or \u03b22 chain (in the CNS) (Libby et al., 2000). Several studies, including our own, suggested that the \u03b33 chain is expressed in both apical and basal compartments (Koch et al., 1999, Gersdorff et al., 2005, Yan and Cheng, 2006). This study investigates the expression pattern of the \u03b33 chain in mouse. We developed three new \u03b33-reactive antibodies, and we show that the \u03b33 chain is present in BMs. The distribution pattern is considerably more restricted than that of the \u03b31 chain and within any tissue there is differential deposition into BM compartments. This is particularly true in the retina and brain, where \u03b33 is uniquely expressed in a subset of the vascular basement membranes and the pial surface. We used conventional genetic ablation techniques to remove the \u03b33 chain in mice; unlike other laminin null mice (\u03b15, \u03b22, \u03b31 nulls), these mice live a normal lifespan and have only minor abnormalities, the most striking of which are ectopic granule cells in the cerebellum and an apparent increase in capillary branching in the outer retina. These data support the suggestion that the \u03b33 chain is deposited in BMs and contributes some unique properties to their function, particularly in the nervous system.",

     "abstract": "Collagen is the prime construction material in vertebrate biology, determining the mechanical behavior of connective tissues such as tendon, bone and skin. Despite extensive efforts in the investigation of the origin of collagen unique mechanical properties, a deep understanding of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical properties remains elusive, hindered by the complex hierarchical structure of collagen-based tissues. In particular, although extensive studies of viscoelastic properties have been pursued at the macroscopic (fiber/tissue) level, fewer investigations have been performed at the smaller scales, including in particular collagen molecules and fibrils. These scales are, however, important for a complete understanding of the role of collagen as an important constituent in the extracellular matrix. Here, using an atomistic modeling approach, we perform in silico creep tests of a collagen-like peptide, monitoring the strain-time response for different values of applied external load. The results show that individual collagen molecules exhibit a nonlinear viscoelastic behavior, with a Young's modulus increasing from 6 to 16\u00a0GPa (for strains up to 20%), a viscosity of 3.84.\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.38\u00a0Pa\u00b7s, and a relaxation time in the range of 0.24\u20130.64\u00a0ns. The single molecule viscosity, for the first time reported here, is several orders of magnitude lower than the viscosity found for larger-scale single collagen fibrils, suggesting that the viscous behavior of collagen fibrils and fibers involves additional mechanisms, such as molecular sliding between collagen molecules within the fibril or the effect of relaxation of larger volumes of solvent. Based on our molecular modeling results we propose a simple structural model that describes collagen tissue as a hierarchical structure, providing a bottom-up description of elastic and viscous properties form the properties of the tissue basic building blocks.",

In-depth studies of mutant COL4A1-associated muscle phenotype, however, are lacking and significant details of the muscle-specific pathomechanisms remain unknown. In this study, we have used a comprehensive set of Drosophila col4a1 and col4a2 mutants and a series of genetic and mutational analyses, gene, protein expression, and immunohistochemistry experiments in order to establish a Drosophila model and address some of these questions. The Drosophila genome contains two type IV collagen genes, col4a1 and col4a2. Mutant heterozygotes of either gene are viable and fertile, whereas homozygotes are lethal. In complementation analysis of all known mutants of the locus and a complementation matrix derived from these data we have identified the dominant lesions within the col4a1, but not within the col4a2 gene. Expression of a col4a1 transgene partially rescued the dominant and recessive mutant col4a1 alleles but not the col4a2 mutations that were all recessive. Partial complementation suggested that col4a1 gene mutations have strong antimorph effect likely due to the incorporation of the mutant protein into the triple helix. In col4a1 mutants, morphological changes of the oviduct muscle included severe myopathy with centronuclear myofibers leading to gradual development of female sterility. In larval body wall muscles ultrastructural changes included disturbance of A and I bands between persisting Z bands. In the most severely affected DTS-L3 mutant, we have identified four missense mutations within the coding region of the col4a1 gene two of which affected the Y within the Gly-X-Y unit and a 3\u2032 UTR point mutation. In conclusion, our Drosophila mutant series may serve as an effective model to uncover the mechanisms by which COL4A1 mutations result in compromised myofiber\u2013basement membrane interactions and aberrant muscle function.",

Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis analyses (on a per cell basis) and immunohistochemistry (n\u00a0=\u00a014) were undertaken.

At least one other non- or 6-sulfated N-acetylgalactosamine proteoglycan(s), which is not decorin or an inter-\u03b1-trypsin inhibitor family member, is present in bovine antral follicles and associated with hitherto unknown groups of cells around some larger blood vessels.

Here we tested the viscoelastic properties of leiomyoma and characterized dynamic and static mechanical signaling in leiomyoma cells using three approaches, including measurement of active RhoA. We found that the peak strain and pseudo-dynamic modulus of leiomyoma tissue was significantly increased relative to matched myometrium. In addition, leiomyoma cells demonstrated an attenuated response to applied cyclic uniaxial strain and to variation in substrate stiffness, relative to myometrial cells. However, on a flexible pronectin-coated silicone substrate, basal levels and lysophosphatidic acid-stimulated levels of activated RhoA were similar between leiomyoma and myometrial cells. In contrast, leiomyoma cells plated on a rigid polystyrene substrate had elevated levels of active RhoA, compared to myometrial cells. The results indicate that viscoelastic properties of the ECM of leiomyoma contribute significantly to the tumor's inherent stiffness and that leiomyoma cells have an attenuated sensitivity to mechanical cues. The findings suggest there may be a fundamental alteration in the communication between the external mechanical environment (extracellular forces) and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton mediated by RhoA in leiomyoma cells. Additional research will be needed to elucidate the mechanism(s) responsible for the attenuated mechanical signaling in leiomyoma cells.",

To develop peptide antagonists selectively inhibiting the function of Mac-1, we used a random constrained 6-mer (cys-6aa-cys) peptide library to map the structural features of CD11b, by determining the epitope of neutralizing monoclonal antibody mAb 44a (anti-CD11b). We have used a stringent phage display strategy, which resulted in the identification of one disulfide C-RLKEKH-C constrained peptide by direct biopanning of library on decreasing amounts of purified mAb 44a. The selected peptide mimics a discontinuous epitope, a peculiar shape on the CD11b-I-domain surface. Competitive ELISA experiments with different Mac-1 ligands showed that C-RLKEKH-C is able to bind to fibrinogen, iC3b, and C1q. Furthermore, the monomeric circular peptide C-RLKEKH-C, was effective in blocking the interaction between 125I-fibrinogen and Mac-1 (IC50\u00a0=\u00a03.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u2212\u00a06\u00a0M), and inhibited the adhesion of human neutrophils to fibrinogen and iC3b.

Recent studies characterizing the cell-matrix adhesions formed by cells within a 3D matrix have arrived at contradictory conclusions regarding the presence and composition of adhesions. Here we review this literature, and provide a comparative compilation of information found in published studies from the 3D cell-matrix adhesion field in order to identify shared and divergent conclusions and conceptually important areas that require further research. Although there is a general consensus that discrete cell-matrix adhesions exist in various 3D matrix environments, there are specific exceptions, particularly in cells undergoing amoeboid migration. There are also technical issues to consider when imaging adhesions in 3D matrix; for example, over-expression of a cytoskeletal cell adhesion component can potentially cloud the visualization of adhesions and even alter the mode of cell migration. Properties such as stiffness and local matrix topography may also affect the composition of cell-matrix adhesions. For example, even though cells contain integrin-based 3D adhesions, there can be substantial variability within these adhesions in the presence of force-dependent cytoskeletal components such as vinculin. These new findings and ideas provide promising new leads for understanding the regulation and function of cell-matrix adhesions in 3D matrix.",

Due to the whole genome duplication two Ucma genes are present in zebrafish, ucmaa and ucmab, located on chromosomes 25 and 4, respectively. UCMA gene structure, alternative splicing and protein sequence are highly conserved between mammals and zebrafish and Ucmaa and Ucmab are expressed in zebrafish skeletal tissues. Ucmaa is first detected in the notochord at 18 hpf and expression continues during notochord development. In addition, it is widely present in the developing craniofacial cartilage. In contrast, the weakly expressed Ucmab can be first detected at specific sites in the craniofacial cartilage at 96 hpf, but not in notochord. Knockdown of ucmaa leads to severe growth retardation and perturbance of skeletal development. The cartilage of the morphants has a decreased aggrecan and collagen II content. Similar malformations were observed when glutamate \u03b3-carboxylation was inhibited by warfarin treatment, indicating that glutamate \u03b3-carboxylation is crucial for Ucma function and pointing to a role of UCMA in the pathogenesis of \u201cwarfarin embryopathies\u201d and other human skeletal diseases.",

To understand the role of perlecan in tooth morphogenesis, we used a keratin 5 promoter to generate transgenic (Tg) mice that over-express perlecan in epithelial cells, and examined their tooth germs at tissue and cellular levels. Immunohistochemistry showed that perlecan was more strongly expressed in the enamel organ cells of Tg mice than in wild-type mice. Histopathology showed wider intercellular spaces in the stellate reticulum of the Tg molars and loss of cellular polarity in the enamel organ, especially in its cervical region. Hertwig's epithelial root sheath (HERS) cells in Tg mice were irregularly aligned due to excessive deposits of perlecan along the inner, as well as on the outer sides of the HERS. Tg molars had dull-ended crowns and outward-curved tooth roots and their enamel was poorly crystallized, resulting in pronounced attrition of molar cusp areas. In Tg mice, expression of integrin \u03b21 mRNA was remarkably higher at E18, while expression of bFGF, TGF-\u03b21, DSPP and Shh was more elevated at P1. The overexpression of perlecan in the enamel organ resulted in irregular morphology of teeth, suggesting that the expression of perlecan regulates growth factor signaling in a stage-dependent manner during each step of the interaction between ameloblast-lineage cells and mesenchymal cells.",

     "abstract": "Accumulation of type I collagen is a key event in renal interstitial fibrosis. As there is no effective treatment, understanding the site where collagen is transcribed and the factors driving it in response to disease in vivo is critical for designing future therapies. The present research investigated the transcriptional activity of the COL1A2 gene in a mouse model of progressive fibrosis induced by aristolochic acid (aristolochic acid nephropathy, AAN). To achieve this we genetically modified mice to express a reporter gene (LacZ) and CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor) under the transcriptional control of the COL1A2 promoter /enhancer sequences. Using these mice we asked where is collagen actively transcribed and secondly, what is the role of CCN2 in AAN. Here, we report that de-novo transcription of the COL1A2 gene occurred predominantly in damaged tubular epithelial cells during progressive interstitial fibrosis in vivo. The activation of COL1A2 was studied by detection of the reporter gene LacZ and COL1A2 mRNA in interstitial, glomerular, vascular, and tubular epithelial tissue from laser capture microscopy. We also demonstrated that LacZ-positive cells co-express E-Cadherin a marker of epithelial origin which is consistent with an epithelial phenotype which is capable of collagen expression during injury. There was no evidence of detachment of these cells from tubules to become myofibroblasts. Moreover, we showed that the transgenic mice show a modest enhancement of CCN2 expression; however fibrosis induced by AA is the same in transgenics and controls suggesting that CCN2, at this level of expression, is not sufficient to enhance fibrogenesis. Overall our study provides a better understanding into the expression patterns and roles of two major extracellular matrix proteins: type I collagen and CCN2.",

In this study, we tested the feasibility of inhibiting activation of proMMP-2 by exogenous inhibitors, which block the binding between PEX and TIMP-2. The recombinant C-TIMP-2 and synthetic peptides from C-TIMP-2 were used as inhibitors for proMMP-2 activation. Recombinant C-TIMP-2 bound specifically to both the catalytically inactive MMP-2E404A and the C-terminal domain of MMP-2 (PEX) in a concentration dependent manner with apparent Kd of 3.9\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0M and 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127\u00a0M, respectively. Moreover, C-TIMP-2 competed the binding between MMP-2E404A and full-length TIMP-2. Finally, activity assays showed that addition of C-TIMP-2 to HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells inhibited proMMP-2 activation in a concentration-dependent manner. We then designed a synthetic peptide, P175L, consisting of 20 residues from the PEX-binding tail region of C-TIMP-2. P175L bound PEX and inhibited cell membrane-mediated activation of proMMP-2 in a concentration dependent manner. Deletion of the last 9 tail residues of C-TIMP-2 in P175L abrogated the inhibitory activities of the peptide showing that these residues were essential for function. Overall, these experiments have demonstrated that proMMP-2 activation can be inhibited by exogenous inhibitors which points to a potential strategy for MMP-2 specific inhibition.",

     "abstract": "The cardiac response to myocardial injury includes fibrotic and hypertrophic processes and a key mediator in this response is transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). Caveolin-1 (cav1), the main structural protein of caveolae, is an inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway. To examine the role of cav1 in cardiac repair, cav1 deficient (Cav1\u2212/\u2212) and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to cryoinjury of the left ventricle (LV). At baseline the two groups exhibited no inflammation, similar collagen content, and similar cardiac function. After injury, Cav1\u2212/\u2212 animals displayed enhanced TGF-\u03b21 signaling, as reflected by a 3-fold increase in the activation of the Smad2-dependent pathway and more widespread collagen deposition in the heart. Qualitative and quantitative analyses indicated that collagen deposition peaked in the WT LV 14\u00a0days after injury, accompanied by increased mRNA abundance for procol1a2 (2-fold) and procol3a1 (3-fold). Collagen deposition was further enhanced in Cav1\u2212/\u2212 mice, which was accompanied by reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP-8 (3-fold) and -13 mRNA (2-fold). The levels of expression of inflammatory markers of acute phase were similar between the strains However, macrophage clearance in the damaged region was delayed in Cav1\u2212/\u2212 mice. We observed a 4-fold decrease in collagen deposition in Cav1\u2212/\u2212 mice injected with a cav1 scaffolding domain peptide (CSD) and a 2-fold decrease in WT mice treated with the CSD. We conclude that cav1 has a direct role in reducing TGF-\u03b21 signaling and as such might be an appropriate target for therapies to influence cardiac remodeling.",

     "abstract": "Pentraxin 3 (PTX3) plays a key role in the formation of the hyaluronan-rich matrix of the cumulus oophorus surrounding ovulated eggs that is required for successful fertilization and female fertility. PTX3 is a multimeric protein consisting of eight identical protomers held together by a combination of non-covalent interactions and disulfide bonds. Recent findings suggest that the oligomeric status of PTX3 is important for stabilizing the cumulus matrix. Because the role of PTX3 in the cumulus resides in the unique N-terminal sequence of the protomer, we investigated further this issue by testing the ability of distinct Cys/Ser mutants of recombinant N-terminal region of PTX3 (N_PTX3) with different oligomeric arrangement to promote in vitro normal expansion in cumuli from Ptx3-null mice. Here we report that the dimer of the N_PTX3 is unable to rescue cumulus matrix organization, and that the tetrameric assembly of the protein is the minimal oligomeric state required for accomplishing this function. We have previously demonstrated that PTX3 binds to HCs of I\u03b1I and TSG-6, which are essential for cumulus matrix formation and able to interact with hyaluronan. Interestingly, here we show by solid-phase binding experiments that the dimer of the N_PTX3 retains the ability to bind to both I\u03b1I and TSG-6, suggesting that the octameric structure of PTX3 provides multiple binding sites for each of these ligands. These findings support the hypothesis that PTX3 contributes to cumulus matrix organization by cross-linking HA polymers through interactions with multiple HCs of I\u03b1I and/or TSG-6. The N-terminal PTX3 tetrameric oligomerization was recently reported to be also required for recognition and inhibition of FGF2. Given that this growth factor has been detected in the mammalian preovulatory follicle, we wondered whether FGF2 negatively influences cumulus expansion and PTX3 may also serve in vivo to antagonize its activity. We found that a molar excess of FGF2, above PTX3 binding capacity, does not affect in vitro cumulus matrix formation thus ruling out this possibility. In conclusion, the data strength the view that PTX3 acts as a nodal molecule in cross-linking HA in the matrix.",

To this end we have used a reporter assay in which the COL5A1 3\u2032-UTR from AT patients and controls were cloned downstream of the firefly luciferase gene and luciferase activity measured as an indication of mRNA stability. When the cloned COL5A13\u2032-UTRs were sequenced, two major forms named C- and T-alleles were predominantly identified in the controls and the AT subjects respectively. The luciferase activity of the C-alleles was significantly lower than that of the T-alleles (69.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a022.0% (N\u00a0=\u00a024) vs. 90.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.7% (N\u00a0=\u00a030), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) which suggests an overall increase in mRNA stability for the T-allele.

A particular challenge in vascular engineering results from the inability of adult cells to produce elastin, as its expression is developmentally limited. We investigated factors to stimulate elastogenesis in vitro, and found that heparin treatment of adult human vascular smooth muscle cells promoted the formation of elastic fibers. This effect was heparin-specific, and dependent on cell density and growth state. We then applied this information to a silk-based construct, and found that immobilized heparin showed essentially identical biological effects to that of soluble heparin. These findings indicate that heparinized vascular grafts may promote elastin formation and regulate restenosis, in addition to heparin's well-established antithrombotic properties.

The pathogenesis of fibrosis involves multiple cell types and extracellular signals, of which transforming growth factor-\u00df (TGF-\u00df) is pre-eminent. The prevalence of fibrosis is rising worldwide, and to date no agents has shown clinical efficacy in the attenuating or reversing the process. Recent studies implicate the immediate\u2013early response transcription factor Egr-1 in the pathogenesis of fibrosis. Egr-1 couples acute changes in the cellular environment to sustained alterations in gene expression, and mediates a broad spectrum of biological responses to injury and stress. In contrast to other ligand-activated transcription factors such as NF-\u03baB, c-jun and Smad2/3 that undergo post-translational modification such as phosphorylation and nuclear translocation, Egr-1 activity is regulated via its biosynthesis. Aberrant Egr-1 expression or activity is implicated in cancer, inflammation, atherosclerosis, and ischemic injury and recent studies now indicate an important role for Egr-1 in TGF-\u00df-dependent profibrotic responses. Fibrosis in various animal models and human diseases such as scleroderma (SSc) and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is accompanied by aberrant Egr-1 expression. Moreover Egr-1 appears to be required for physiologic and pathological connective tissue remodeling, and Egr-1-null mice are protected from fibrosis. As a novel profibrotic mediator, Egr-1 thus appears to be a promising potential target for the development of anti-fibrotic therapies.",

     "abstract": "Cross bridges are radial structures within the highly organized lamellar structure of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc that connect two or more non-consecutive lamellae. Their origin and function are unknown. During fetal development, blood vessels penetrate deep within the AF and recede during postnatal growth. We hypothesized that cross bridges are the pathways left by these receding blood vessels.Initially, the presence of cross bridges was confirmed in cadaveric human discs aged 25 and 53\u00a0years. Next, L1\u2013L2 intervertebral discs (n\u00a0=\u00a04) from sheep ranging in age from 75\u00a0days fetal gestation to adult were processed for paraffin histology. Mid-sagittal sections were immunostained for endothelial cell marker PECAM-1. The anterior and posterior AF were imaged using differential interference contrast microscopy, and the following parameters were quantified: total number of distinct lamellae, total number of cross bridges, percentage of cross bridges staining positive for PECAM-1, cross bridge penetration depth (% total lamellae), and PECAM-1 positive cross bridge penetration depth.Cross bridges were first observed at 100\u00a0days fetal gestation. The overall number peaked in neonates then remained relatively unchanged. The percentage of PECAM-1 positive cross bridges declined progressively from almost 100% at 100\u00a0days gestation to less than 10% in adults. Cross bridge penetration depth peaked in neonates then remained unchanged at subsequent ages. Depth of PECAM-1 positive cross bridges decreased progressively after birth. Findings were similar for both the anterior and posterior.The AF lamellar architecture is established early in development. It later becomes disrupted as a consequence of vascularization. Blood vessels then recede, perhaps due to increasing mechanical stresses in the surrounding matrix. In this study we present evidence that the pathways left by receding blood vessels remain as lamellar cross bridges. It is unclear whether the presence of cross bridges in the aging and degenerating intervertebral disc would be advantageous or detrimental, and this question should be addressed by future studies.",

The matrilins are adaptor proteins with a function in connecting fibrillar and network-like components in the cartilage extracellular matrix. Cleavage resulting in processed matrilins with fewer ligand-binding subunits could make these less efficient in providing matrix cohesion. In this study, the processing and degradation of matrilin-4 during cartilage remodeling in the growth plate of the developing mouse long bones were studied in greater detail. We show that ADAMTS-5 and a matrilin-4 neoepitope, revealed upon ADAMTS cleavage, colocalize in prehypertrophic/hypertrophic chondrocytes while they are not detected in proliferating chondrocytes of the growth plate. ADAMTS-5 and the cleaved matrilin-4 are preferentially detected in vesicles derived from the Golgi apparatus. The matrilin-4 neoepitope was not observed in the growth plate of ADAMTS-5 deficient mice.

The mechanisms for these differential responses are not known, but may result from divergence in regulation of early osteogenic transcription factors. The purpose of this study was to elucidate where in the hierarchy of osteoblast-specific transcription factors and markers the differences in MMP-1- and -13-mediated regulation of osteoblastic differentiation arise. We found that the overexpression of MMP-1 resulted in significant decreases in BMP-2, Dlx5, AP, OP and BSP and increases in TGF-\u03b21 and MSX2. In contrast, MMP-13 overexpression resulted in significant decreases in Runx2, OP and BSP, and increases in TGF-\u03b21, MSX2 and OC. The knockdown of MMP-1 caused significant increases in all osteoblastic markers. MMP-13 knockdown produced significant increases only in TGF-\u03b21, MSX2 and Osx, but decreases in Runx2 and OC. Suppression of both MMPs together resulted in significant increases of all osteoblastic markers except Runx2. MMP-1 had a more robust and generalized effect in regulating osteoblast transcription factors and markers than MMP-13. Finally, of the markers and transcription factors assayed, Runx2 is the most early stage transcription factor induced by suppression of MMP-1, while Osx and MSX2 are the most early stage transcription factors regulated by MMP-13. These data show that MMP-1's and -13's differential regulation of osteoblastic markers in MG63 cells likely results from their modulation of divergent signaling pathways involved in osteoblastic differentiation.",

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are required for regular skin wound healing and the distinctive pattern of their expression has been implicated to promote scarless healing. In this study, we analyzed the temporal and spatial expression patterns of these molecules during the incisional skin wounds in adult nude mice. Macroscopic and histological analyses of skin wounds revealed an accelerated wound healing process, minimal granulation tissue formation and markedly diminished scarring in nude mice. Quantitative RT-PCR (Mmp-2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -12, -13, -14 and Timp-1, -2, -3), Western blots (MMP-13) and gelatin zymography (MMP-9) revealed that MMP-9 and MMP-13 showed a unique, bimodal pattern of up-regulation during the early and late phases of wound healing in nude mice. Immunohistochemically MMP-9 and MMP-13 were generally detected in epidermis during the early phase and in dermis during the late (remodeling) phase. Consistent with these in vivo observations, dermal fibroblasts cultured from nude mice expressed higher levels of types I and III collagen, MMP-9 and MMP-13 mRNA levels and higher MMP enzyme activity than wild type controls. Collectively, these finding suggest that the bimodal pattern of MMP-9 and MMP-13 expression during skin repair process in nude mice could be a major component of their ability for scarless healing.",

     "abstract": "Many significant human birth defects originate around the time of neural tube closure or early during post-closure nervous system development. For example, failure of the neural tube to close generates anencephaly and spina bifida, faulty cell cycle progression is implicated in primary microcephaly, while defective migration of neuroblasts can lead to neuronal migration disorders such as lissencephaly. At the stage of neural tube closure, basement membranes are becoming organised around the neuroepithelium, and beneath the adjacent non-neural surface ectoderm. While there is circumstantial evidence to implicate basement membrane dynamics in neural tube and surface ectodermal development, we have an incomplete understanding of the molecular composition of basement membranes at this stage. In the present study, we examined the developing basement membranes of the mouse embryo at mid-gestation (embryonic day 9.5), with particular reference to laminin composition. We performed in situ hybridization to detect the mRNAs of all eleven individual laminin chains, and immunohistochemistry to identify which laminin chains are present in the basement membranes. From this information, we inferred the likely laminin variants and their tissues of origin: that is, whether a given basement membrane laminin is contributed by epithelium, mesenchyme, or both. Our findings reveal major differences in basement composition along the body axis, with the rostral neural tube (at mandibular arch and heart levels) exhibiting many distinct laminin variants, while the lumbar level where the neural tube is just closing shows a much simpler laminin profile. Moreover, there appears to be a marked difference in the extent to which the mesenchyme contributes laminin variants to the basement membrane, with potential contribution of several laminins rostrally, but no contribution caudally. This information paves the way towards a mechanistic analysis of basement membrane laminin function during early neural tube development in mammals.",

The possibility that 4-MU exerts at least some of its actions via regulation of UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGDH), a key enzyme required for both HA and sulphated-glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) production, remains unexplored. We therefore examined the effects of 4-MU on basal and retroviral UGDH-driven HA and sGAG release in cells derived from chick articular cartilage and its influence upon UGDH protein and mRNA expression and HA and sGAG production. We found that 4-MU: i) suppressed UGDH mRNA and protein expression and chondrogenic matrix accumulation in chick limb bud micromass culture, ii) significantly reduced both HA and sGAG production and iii) more selectively reversed the potentiating effects of UGDH overexpression on the production of HA than sGAG.

Histological and ultrastructural analyses of cartilage elements in loxl3b morphant embryos reveal abnormal maturation of cartilage and altered chondrocyte morphology. Spatiotemporal analysis of craniofacial markers in loxl3b morphant embryos shows that cranial neural crest cells migrate normally into the developing pharyngeal arches but that differentiation and condensation markers are aberrantly expressed. We further show that the loxl3b morphant phenotype is not due to P53 mediated cell death but likely to be due to reduced chondrogenic progenitor cell proliferation within the pharyngeal arches. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel role for loxl3b in the maturation of craniofacial cartilage and can provide new insight into the specific genetic factors important in the pathogenesis of craniofacial birth defects.",

The interaction between tenascin-C and SMOC1 was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and further analyzed by Surface Plasmon Resonance Spectroscopy, which revealed an apparent dissociation constant (KD) value of 2.59\u00a0\u2217\u00a010\u22129M.

In support of these data, western blot analysis of protein extracts from 12 oligodendrogliomas, 4 astrocytomas and 13 glioblastomas revealed elevated levels compared to healthy brain extract.

Collagen XVIII has three variants, of which the shortest one is found in most vascular and epithelial BM structures, whereas the longer variants are found especially in the liver. The longest or frizzled variant has a cysteine-rich domain in its N-terminus that has been shown to inhibit Wnt signaling in vitro. The presence of collagen XVIII homologues in organisms such as C. elegans, Xenopus laevis, zebrafish and chick suggests a fundamental role for this BM collagen. Mutations in the collagen XVIII gene lead to the Knobloch syndrome, which is characterized by high myopia, vitreoretinal degeneration with retinal detachment, macular abnormalities and occipital encephalocele. Mice lacking collagen XVIII also show several ocular abnormalities. This suggests that in physiological conditions collagen XVIII is mostly needed for the proper development of the eye.

Previous observations have led to the hypothesis that an interaction between COL17 and laminin 332, an extracellular matrix protein, contributes to the attachment of the basal keratinocyte to the basement membrane. In order to isolate and manipulate COL17 interactions with ECM components, we induced COL17 expression in two cells lines, SK-MEL1 and K562, that exhibit little or no capacity to attach to our test substrates, including laminin 332, types I and IV collagen, and fibronectin. Cells expressing high levels of COL17 preferentially adhered to a laminin 332 matrix, and, to a lesser extent, type IV collagen, while showing little or no binding to type I collagen or fibronectin. A quantitative analysis of cell adhesive forces revealed that, compared with COL17-negative cells, COL17-positive cells required over 7-fold greater force to achieve 50% detachment from a laminin 332 substrate. When a cell preparation (either K562 or SK-MEL1) with heterogeneous COL17 expression levels was allowed to attach to a laminin 332 matrix, the COL17-positive and COL17-negative cells differentially sorted to the bound and unbound cell fractions, respectively. COL17-dependent attachment to laminin 332 could be reduced or abolished by siRNA-mediated knock-down of COL17 expression or by adding to the assay wells specific antibodies against COL17 or laminin 332.

     "abstract": "Extracellular matrix factors, specifically fibronectin and collagen I, are essential for structural support during muscle regeneration. Decorin has been identified as an anti-fibrotic agent with binding sites located on both fibronectin and collagen I. Upon injury, activated myoblasts are required to migrate through the extracellular matrix factors deposited by the myofibroblasts to facilitate skeletal muscle regeneration. In this study we looked at the effects decorin on fibronectin- and collagen I-stimulated myoblast migration. Dose response studies demonstrated 10\u00a0\u03bcg/ml, 5\u00a0\u03bcg/ml and 25\u00a0\u03bcg/ml as the optimal stimulatory concentrations of decorin (1.2 fold increase), fibronectin (3.5 fold increase) and collagen I (2.4 fold increase), when compared with control respectively. A synergistic effect was identified when decorin and collagen I were added in combination; this effect was not evident when decorin was added with fibronectin. The effects of these factors on the ROCK signalling pathway were also analyzed. ROCK-2 was identified as the key Rho-activated kinase isoform involved in migration, due to its higher expression levels and localisation to focal points within migrating C2C12 myoblasts. Decorin and collagen I in combination stimulated an increase in the number of ROCK-2 localized focal points when compared with control, decorin and collagen I added separately. Fibronectin did not show any increase in ROCK-2 focal points when compared with control. These results show for the first time that decorin can modify collagen I-stimulated, but not fibronectin-stimulated myoblast migration in vitro. Furthermore, the synergistic, rather than additive, effect observed suggests a direct modification of collagen I signalling by decorin mediated, at least in part, by ROCK-2 rather than ROCK-1.",

     "abstract": "Type XVI collagen belongs to the family of fibril-associated collagens with interrupted triple helices (FACIT). Recently, high affinity to integrin alpha1beta1 has been shown allowing cells expressing those integrins to attach and spread on recombinant type XVI collagen. Here, we show that type XVI collagen is overexpressed in dysplastic areas of mucosal epithelium from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients. Induction of its expression in OSCC cell lines (COLXVI cells) leads to an increased expression of Kindlin-1. Moreover, we demonstrate a significantly increased Kindlin-1/beta1-integrin interaction. Additionally, we detected a higher number of activated beta1-integrins in COLXVI cells and found a neo-expression of alpha1 integrin subunit on these cells. FACS analysis revealed a significantly higher amount of COLXVI cells in S-phase and G2/M-phase 6\u00a0h after synchronisation leading to a markedly higher proliferation activity. Blocking beta1-integrins with a specific antibody resulted in reduced proliferation of COLXVI cells. In summary, we demonstrate that overexpression of type XVI collagen in aberrant oral keratinocytes leads to Kindlin-1 induction, increased Kindlin-1/beta1-integrin interaction, integrin activation and subsequently to a proliferative cellular phenotype.",

     "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by airway remodeling, which includes changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM). However the role of the ECM in mediating these changes is poorly understood. Hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the ECM, has been implicated in asthma as well as in many other biological processes. Our study investigates the processes involved in HA synthesis, deposition, localization and degradation during an acute and chronic murine model of ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic pulmonary inflammation. Mice were sensitized, challenged to OVA and sacrificed at various time points during an 8-week challenge protocol. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids, blood, and lung tissue were collected for study. RNA, HA, protein and histopathology were analyzed. Analyses of lung sections and BAL fluids revealed an early deposition and an increase in HA levels within 24\u00a0h of antigen exposure. HA levels peaked at day 8 in BAL, while inflammatory cell recovery peaked at day 6. Hyaluronan synthase (HAS)1 and HAS2 on RNA levels peaked within 2\u00a0h of antigen exposure, while hyaluronidase (HYAL)1 and HYAL2 on RNA levels decreased. Both inflammatory cell infiltrates and collagen deposition co-localized with HA deposition within the lungs. These data support a role for HA in the pathogenesis of inflammation and airway remodeling in a murine model of asthma. HA deposition appears largely due to up regulation of HAS1 and HAS2. In addition, HA appears to provide the scaffolding for inflammatory cell accumulation as well as for new collagen synthesis and deposition.",

It has long been recognized that mechanical stress is an important modulator of the intervertebral disc degeneration. Here we studied the influence of substrate stiffness on cell morphology, apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) metabolism of the rat annulus fibrosus (AF) cells which are known to be mechanosensitive cells. Polyacrylamide gel substrates with three different stiffnesses were prepared by varying the concentration of acrylamide and bisacrylamide, and the elastic modulus of the different gel substrates were measured with atomic force microscopy (AFM). First-passage rat annular cells were cultured on soft, intermediate, rigid substrates or plastics for 24 or 48\u00a0h. The percentages of apoptotic cells were detected by flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity, and morphologic changes were visualized by Hoechst 33258 staining and F-actin staining. In addition, the expression of ECM genes (Col1\u03b11, Col2\u03b11, aggrecan, MMP-3, MMP-13 and ADAMTS-5) were analyzed by RT-PCR. The three different substrates had elastic moduli varying between 1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23\u00a0kPa (soft, 5% gel with 0.06% bis), 32\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.89\u00a0kPa (intermediate, 10% gel with 0.13% bis) and 63\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.45\u00a0kPa (rigid, 10% gel with 0.26% bis) with a thickness about 60\u201370\u00a0\u03bcm. Most of the rat AF cells appeared small and rounded, and lost most of their stress fibers when cultured on soft substrate. There was a significant increase in the percentage of apoptotic cells in the rat AF cells cultured on soft and intermediate substrates relative to those on plastic surface, with a parallel decrease in the area of cell spreading and nucleus. The AF cells grown on intermediate or rigid substrate had reduced expression of Col1\u03b11, Col2\u03b11 and aggrecan and enhanced expression of MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 at 24\u00a0h or 48\u00a0h, respectively, relative to those cultured on plastic surface. Conversely, we observed an up-regulation of Col2\u03b11 and aggrecan and no change in the gene expression of MMP-3, MMP-13, and ADAMTS-5 in AF cells on soft substrates. Rat AF cells are sensitive to substrate stiffness which can regulate the morphology, growth, apoptosis and ECM metabolism of rat AF cells, thus indicating the importance of substrate choice for cell transplantation and regeneration for the treatment of disc degeneration using tissue-engineering technique.",

     "abstract": "Aggrecan degradation in articular cartilage occurs predominantly through proteolysis and has been attributed to the action of members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) families. Both families of enzymes cleave aggrecan at specific sites within the aggrecan core protein. One cleavage site within the interglobular domain (IGD), between Glu373\u2013374Ala and five additional sites in the chondroitin sulfate-2 (CS-2) region of aggrecan were characterized as \u201caggrecanase\u201d (ADAMTS) cleavage sites, while cleavage between Ser341\u2013342Phe within the IGD of bovine aggrecan is attributed to MMP action. The objective of this study was to assess the cleavage efficiency of MMPs relative to ADAMTS and their contribution to aggrecan proteolysis in vitro. The analysis of aggrecan IGD degradation in bovine articular cartilage explants treated with catabolic cytokines over a 19-day period showed that MMP-mediated degradation of aggrecan within the IGD can only be observed following day 12 of culture. This delay is associated with the lack of activation of proMMPs during the first 12\u00a0days of culture. Analysis of MMP1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and ADAMTS5 efficiencies at cleaving within the aggrecan IGD and CS-2 region in vitro was carried out by the digestion of bovine aggrecan with the various enzymes and Western blot analysis using aggrecan anti-G1 and anti-G3 antibodies. Of these MMPs, MMP12 was the most efficient at cleaving within the aggrecan IGD. In addition to cleavage in the IGD, MMP, 3, 7, 8 and 12 were also able to degrade the aggrecan CS-2 region. MMP3 and MMP12 were able to degrade aggrecan at the very C-terminus of the CS-2 region, cleaving the Glu2047\u20132048Ala bond which was previously shown to be cleaved by ADAMTS5. However, in comparison to ADAMTS5, MMP3 was about 100 times and 10 times less efficient at cleaving within the aggrecan IGD and CS-2 regions, respectively. Collectively, our results showed that the delayed activation of proMMPs and the relatively low cleavage efficiency of MMPs can explain the minor contribution of these enzymes to aggrecan catabolism in vivo. This study also uncovered a potential role for MMPs in the C-terminal truncation of aggrecan.",

Electron microscopy revealed increased mitochondrial densities in skeletal muscle from both CD47 null and thrombospondin-1 null mice. We further assessed the mitochondria status of CD47-null vs WT mice. Quantitative RT-PCR of RNA extracted from tissues of 3\u00a0month old mice revealed dramatically elevated expression of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins and PGC-1\u03b1 in both fast and slow-twitch skeletal muscle from CD47-null mice, but modest to no elevation in other tissues. These observations were confirmed by Western blotting of mitochondrial proteins. Relative amounts of electron transport enzymes and ATP/O2 ratios of isolated mitochondria were not different between mitochondria from CD47-null and WT cells. Young CD47-null mice displayed enhanced treadmill endurance relative to WTs and CD47-null gastrocnemius had undergone fiber type switching to a slow-twitch pattern of myoglobin and myosin heavy chain expression. In 12\u00a0month old mice, both skeletal muscle mitochondrial volume density and endurance had decreased to wild type levels. Expression of myosin heavy chain isoforms and myoglobin also reverted to a fast twitch pattern in gastrocnemius. Both CD47 and TSP1 null mice are leaner than WTs, use less oxygen and produce less heat than WT mice. CD47-null cells produce substantially less reactive oxygen species than WT cells. These data indicate that loss of signaling from the TSP1\u2013CD47 system promotes accumulation of normally functioning mitochondria in a tissue-specific and age-dependent fashion leading to enhanced physical performance, lower reactive oxygen species production and more efficient metabolism.",

Fourteen years ago, the patient underwent a partial esophageal resection followed by a replacement with jejunum. Recently, she underwent a surgical resection of the esophagus due to esophageal dysfunction. Genetic analyses of COL4A5 and COL4A6 on the X-chromosome were efficiently performed using the genomic DNA of her son. We have identified a novel deletion of 194-kb in length, encompassing COL4A5\u2013COL4A6 promoters as well as nearly the entire large intron 1 of COL4A5 and intron 2 of COL4A6. To uncover the relationship of the esophagus-specific occurrence of the tumor and the expression of those genes, immunohistochemical analyses of type IV collagen \u03b1 chains were conducted in the non-affected individuals. The esophageal smooth muscle-specific expression of \u03b15(IV) and \u03b16(IV) chains in the gastrointestinal tract was observed. Moreover, CAG repeat analysis of the androgen receptor gene and an immunohistochemical analysis in the leiomyoma revealed clonal overgrowth of the cells which received X-inactivation on the non-affected allele. These results may suggest that the dominant effect was caused by the partial deletion of the esophageal smooth muscle-specific genes, COL4A5 and COL4A6.",

The hydrophobic core of the trimer is devoid of solvent molecules and is shaped by \u03b2-sheet planes from each monomer. The trimerization domain is extremely stable and forms at picomolar concentrations. It is found that the trimerization domain of type XV collagen is structurally similar to that of type XVIII, despite only 32% sequence identity. High structural conservation indicates that the multiplexin trimerization domain represents a three dimensional fold that allows for sequence variability while retaining structural integrity necessary for tight and efficient trimerization.",

We previously identified GVMGFO (O is hydroxyproline) as a major DDR2 binding site in collagens I\u2013III, and located two additional DDR2 binding sites in collagen II. Here we extend these studies to the homologous DDR1 and the identification of DDR binding sites on collagen III. Using sets of overlapping triple-helical peptides, the Collagen II and Collagen III Toolkits, we located several DDR2 binding sites on both collagens. The interaction of DDR1 with Toolkit peptides was more restricted, with DDR1 mainly binding to peptides containing the GVMGFO motif. Triple-helical peptides containing the GVMGFO motif induced DDR1 transmembrane signalling, and DDR1 binding and receptor activation occurred with the same amino acid requirements as previously defined for DDR2. While both DDRs exhibit the same specificity for binding the GVMGFO motif, which is present only in fibrillar collagens, the two receptors display distinct preferences for certain non-fibrillar collagens, with the basement membrane collagen IV being exclusively recognised by DDR1. Based on our recent crystal structure of a DDR2-collagen complex, we designed mutations to identify the molecular determinants for DDR1 binding to collagen IV. By replacing five amino acids in DDR2 with the corresponding DDR1 residues we were able to create a DDR2 construct that could function as a collagen IV receptor.",

This area is covered by amino acids 541\u2013547 in human LH3, but contains no cysteine residues. The region is highly conserved among LH isoforms, and is also involved in the dimerization of LH1 subunits.

In order to determine whether complex formation can occur between LH molecules originating from different species, and between different LH isoforms, double expressions were generated in a baculovirus system. Heterocomplex formation between mouse and human LH3, between human LH1 and LH3 and between human LH2 and LH3 was detected by western blot analyses.

The cleavage has been ascribed to inherent autolytic protease activities as well as co-purified matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). Understanding the mechanism by which the proteolysis of FN occurs is important, because the FN fragments have biological activities that differ from those of intact FN. Having excluded contributions of other plasma-derived proteases, the present experiments demonstrated that cleavage of FN by MMP-2 to distinct fragments occurred in synergy with inherent FN activities. Limited heat treatment of FN at 56\u00a0\u00b0C for 30\u00a0min inactivated the inherent protease activities sharply reducing autolysis of FN in a manner similar to that seen in the presence of serine proteinase inhibitors. Heat treatment did not alter cell attachment to FN, but significantly increased the susceptibility of FN to enzymatic cleavage by MMP-2. The carboxyl-terminal hemopexin-like domain (PEX) of MMP-2 was shown to possess critical exodomain properties required for the interactions of MMP-2 with FN, and FN was cleaved at a significantly reduced rate by an MMP-2 variant with deletion of PEX. Verifying the specificity of interactions, isolated PEX competed FN cleavage by MMP-2 in a concentration-dependent manner. These results have further elucidated the synergistic contributions of inherent autolytic serine protease-like activities and MMP-2 to fragmentation of FN and provide the rationale and basis for modified preparation and handling of FN used in biological research.",

Fibrillin-3 was more recently discovered and is much less well characterized. Fibrillin-1 is expressed throughout life, whereas fibrillins-2 and -3 are thought to be primarily present during development. Here, we report detailed fibrillin-3 expression patterns in early human development.A polyclonal antiserum against a C-terminal recombinant half of human fibrillin-3 was produced in rabbit. Anti-fibrillin-3 antibodies were affinity-purified and antibodies cross-reacting with the other fibrillins were removed by absorption resulting in specific anti-fibrillin-3 antibodies. Immunohistochemical analyses with these purified antibodies demonstrate that fibrillin-3 is temporally expressed in numerous tissues relatively evenly from the 6th to the 12th gestational week. Fibrillin-3 was found spatially expressed in perichondrium, perineurium, perimysium, skin, developing bronchi, glomeruli, pancreas, kidney, heart and testis and at the prospective basement membranes in developing epithelia and endothelia. Double immunohistochemical analyses showed that all fibrillins are globally expressed in the same organs, with a number of differences on the tissue level in cartilage, perichondrium and developing bronchi.

Collagen VI is a non-fibrillar collagen expressed in developing and adult tendons. Human collagen VI mutations result in muscular dystrophy, joint hyperlaxity and contractures. The purpose of this study is to determine the functional roles of collagen VI in tendon matrix assembly. During tendon development, collagen VI was expressed throughout the extracellular matrix, but enriched around fibroblasts and their processes. To analyze the functional roles of collagen VI a mouse model with a targeted inactivation of Col6a1 gene was utilized. Ultrastructural analysis of Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 versus wild type tendons demonstrated disorganized extracellular micro-domains and associated collagen fibers in the Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 tendon. In Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 tendons, fibril structure and diameter distribution were abnormal compared to wild type controls. The diameter distributions were shifted significantly toward the smaller diameters in Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 tendons compared to controls. An analysis of fibril density (number/\u03bcm2) demonstrated a ~\u00a02.5 fold increase in the Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 versus wild type tendons. In addition, the fibril arrangement and structure were aberrant in the peri-cellular regions of Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 tendons with frequent very large fibrils and twisted fibrils observed restricted to this region. The biomechanical properties were analyzed in mature tendons. A significant decrease in cross-sectional area was observed. The percent relaxation, maximum load, maximum stress, stiffness and modulus were analyzed and Col6a1\u2212/\u2212 tendons demonstrated a significant reduction in maximum load and stiffness compared to wild type tendons. An increase in matrix metalloproteinase activity was suggested in the absence of collagen VI. This suggests alterations in tenocyte expression due to disruption of cell\u2013matrix interactions. The changes in expression may result in alterations in the peri-cellular environment. In addition, the absence of collagen VI may alter the sequestering of regulatory molecules such as leucine rich proteoglycans. These changes would result in dysfunctional regulation of tendon fibrillogenesis indirectly mediated by collagen VI.",

     "abstract": "A functional renin\u2013angiotensin system (RAS) is required for normal kidney development. Neonatal inhibition of the RAS in rats results in long-term pathological renal phenotype and causes hyaluronan (HA), which is involved in morphogenesis and inflammation, to accumulate. To elucidate the mechanisms, intrarenal HA content was followed during neonatal completion of nephrogenesis with or without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (ACEI) together with mRNA expression of hyaluronan synthases (HAS), hyaluronidases (Hyal), urinary hyaluronidase activity and cortical lymphatic vessels, which facilitate the drainage of HA from the tissue. In 6\u20138\u00a0days old control rats cortical HA content was high and reduced by 93% on days 10\u201321, reaching adult low levels. Medullary HA content was high on days 6\u20138 and then reduced by 85% to 12-fold above cortical levels at day 21. In neonatally ACEI-treated rats the reduction in HA was abolished. Temporal expression of HAS2 corresponded with the reduction in HA content in the normal kidney. In ACEI-treated animals cortical HAS2 remained twice the expression of controls. Medullary Hyal1 increased in controls but decreased in ACEI-treated animals. Urine hyaluronidase activity decreased with time in control animals while in ACEI-treated animals it was initially 50% lower and did not change over time. Cells expressing the lymphatic endothelial mucoprotein podoplanin in ACEI-treated animals were increased 18-fold compared to controls suggesting compensation. In conclusion, the high renal HA content is rapidly reduced due to reduced HAS2 and increased Hyal1 mRNA expressions. Normal angiotensin II function is crucial for inducing these changes. Due to the extreme water-attracting and pro-inflammatory properties of HA, accumulation in the neonatally ACEI-treated kidneys may partly explain the pathological renal phenotype of the adult kidney, which include reduced urinary concentration ability and tubulointerstitial inflammation.",

     "abstract": "Disruption of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is frequently found in calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), yet the role of ECM components in valvular interstitial cell (VIC) function and dysfunction remains poorly understood. This study examines the contributions of exogenous and endogenous hyaluronic acid (HA), in both two-dimensional (2-D) and 3-D environments, in regulating the phenotype and calcification of VICs. VIC calcification was first assessed in a 2-D setting in which the cells were exposed to different molecular weights of exogenous HA presented in either an immobilized or soluble form. Delivery of HA suppressed nodule formation in a molecular weight-dependent manner, while blocking VIC recognition of HA via an antibody to CD44 abolished these nodule-suppressive effects and stimulated other hallmarks of valvular dysfunction. These 2-D results were then validated in a more physiologically-relevant setting, using an approach that allowed the characterization of VIC phenotype in response to HA alterations in the native 3-D environment. In this approach, leaflet organ cultures were analyzed following treatment with anti-CD44 or with hyaluronidase to specifically remove HA. Disruption of VIC\u2013HA interactions upregulated markers of VIC disease and induced leaflet mineralization. Similarly, HA-deficient leaflets exhibited numerous hallmarks of CAVD, including increased VIC proliferation, apoptosis, increased expression of disease-related markers, and mineralization. These findings suggest that VIC\u2013HA interactions are crucial in maintaining a healthy VIC phenotype. Identification ECM components that can regulate VIC phenotype and function has significant implications for understanding native valve disease, investigating possible treatments, and designing new biomaterials for valve tissue engineering.",

Due to the identification of new molecular markers during the last decade, there has been a recent dramatic increase in our knowledge on the molecular mechanisms involved in lymphatic vessel growth (lymphangiogenesis) and lymphatic function. Here we review data showing that although it is often overlooked, the extracellular matrix plays an important role in the generation of new lymphatic vessels as a response to physiological and pathological stimuli. Extracellular matrix-lymphatic interactions as well as biophysical characteristics of the stroma have consequences for tumor formation, growth and metastasis. During the recent years, anti-lymphangiogenesis has emerged as an additional therapeutic modality to the clinically applied anti-angiogenesis strategy. Oppositely, enhancement of lymphangiogenesis in situations of lymph accumulation is seen as a promising strategy to a set of conditions where few therapeutic avenues are available. Knowledge on the interaction between the extracellular matrix and the lymphatics may enhance our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and may ultimately lead to better therapies for conditions where reduced or increased lymphatic function is the therapeutic target.",

Such a model was designed on the basis of a \u201ctranswell\u201d assay, with an insert seeded with human bone marrow stromal cells and a well with a desired cell type. To mimic physiological environment and to simulate \u201cinjury\u201d, cells in a well were maintained not only on tissue culture plastic but also on collagens I and IV, major matrix components in musculoskeletal and adipose tissues respectively, and subjected to a severe thermal stress. The results obtained showed a massive translocation of bone marrow stromal cells through the inserts' membrane toward the \u201cinjury\u201d site. Unexpectedly, it emerged that collagen matrix is essential in producing such a migration. The results obtained suggest that upon injury cells secrete a substance which interacts with collagen matrix to produce a homing agent. The substance in question appears to be a protease and its interaction with the collagen matrix appears to be a digestion of the latter into fragments shown to be chemotactic. Both AEBSF, an inhibitor of serine proteases, and leupeptin, an inhibitor of cysteine proteases as well as of trypsin-like serine proteases, but not the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor marimastat, significantly inhibit the observed homing effect and this inhibition is not due to cytotoxicity. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of HTRA1, a trypsin-like serine protease known to be secreted by cells differentiating into all three major mesenchymal lineages and by stressed cells in general and shown to degrade a number of matrix proteins including collagen, significantly diminished the homing effect. The data suggest that this protease is a major contributor to the observed chemotaxis of bone marrow stromal cells. The present study indicates that collagen fragments can mediate the migration of bone marrow stromal cells. The results also suggest that, at least in musculoskeletal and in adipose tissues, matrix remodeling occurrences, usually closely associated with tissue remodeling, should also be regarded as potential stem cells recruitment events.",

However, thus far, no information has been available on the mechanism of tendon formation in vitro and how to accelerate the process. We show here that human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) can generate tendon-like tissue in 7\u00a0days mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b23. MSCs cultured in fixed-length fibrin gels spontaneously synthesized narrow-diameter collagen fibrils and exhibited fibripositors (actin-rich, collagen fibril-containing plasma membrane protrusions) identical to those that occur in embryonic tendon. In contrast, BM-MNCs did not synthesize tendon-like tissue under these conditions. We performed real-time PCR analysis of MSCs and BM-MNCs. MSCs upregulated genes encoding type I collagen, TGF\u03b23, and Smad2 at the time of maximum contraction of the tendon-like tissue (7\u00a0days). Western blot analysis showed phosphorylation of Smad2 at maximum contraction. The TGF\u03b2 inhibitor SB-431542, blocked the phosphorylation of Smad2 and stopped the formation of tendon-like tissue. Quantitative PCR showed that BM-MNCs expressed very low levels of TGF\u03b23 compared to MSCs. Therefore we added exogenous TGF\u03b23 protein to BM-MNCs in fibrin gels, which resulted in phosphorylation of Smad2, synthesis of collagen fibrils, the appearance of fibripositors at the plasma membrane, and the formation of tendon-like tissue. In conclusion, MSCs that self-generate TGF\u03b2 signaling or the addition of TGF\u03b23 protein to BM-MNCs in fixed-length fibrin gels spontaneously make embryonic tendon-like tissue in vitro within 7\u00a0days.",

The constructs display mechanical properties (toe\u2013linear\u2013fail stress\u2013strain curve, stiffness, ultimate tensile strength, and failure strain) as well as collagen fibril volume fraction and extracellular matrix (ECM)/cell ratio that are statistically similar to those of embryonic chick metatarsal tendons. The development of mechanical properties during time in culture was abolished when the constructs were treated separately with Triton X-100 (to solubilise membranes), cytochalasin (to disassemble the actin cytoskeleton) and blebbistatin (a small molecule inhibitor of non-muscle myosin II). Importantly, these treatments had no effect on the mechanical properties of the constructs that existed prior to treatment. Live-cell imaging and 14C-proline metabolic labeling showed that blebbistatin inhibited the contraction of the constructs without affecting cell viability, procollagen synthesis, or conversion of procollagen to collagen.

One exception is the adult MRL/MpJ mouse that can regenerate ear and cardiac tissue after wounding with little evidence of scar tissue formation. Following production of a MRL mouse ear hole, 2\u00a0mm in diameter, a structure rapidly forms at the injury site that resembles the amphibian blastema at a limb amputation site during limb regeneration. We have isolated MRL blastemal cells (MRL-B) from this structure and adapted them to culture. We demonstrate by RT-PCR that even after continuous culturing of these cells they maintain expression of several progenitor cell markers, including DLK (Pref-1), and Msx-1. We have isolated the underlying extracellular matrix (ECM) produced by these MRL-B cells using a new non-proteolytic method and studied the biological activities of this cell-free ECM. Multiplex microELISA analysis of MRL-B cell-free ECM vs. cells revealed selective enrichment of growth factors such as bFGF, HGF and KGF in the matrix compartment. The cell-free ECM, degraded by mild enzyme treatment, was active in promoting migration and proliferation of progenitor cells in vitro and accelerating wound closure in a mouse full thickness cutaneous wound assay in vivo. In vivo, a single application of MRL-B cell matrix-derived products to full thickness cutaneous wounds in non-regenerative mice, B6, induced re-growth of pigmented hair, dermis and epidermis at the wound site whereas scar tissue replaced these tissues at wound sites in mice treated with vehicle alone. These studies suggest that matrix-derived products can stimulate regenerative healing and avert scar tissue formation in adult mammals.",

The purpose of the present study was to clarify the involvement of Sp7/Osterix in the mouse Col5a1 gene. A functional analysis revealed that mutation of the Sp1 binding site specifically decreased the promoter activity in osteoblastic cells. An overexpression of Sp7/Osterix significantly increased the promoter activity and the endogenous mRNA levels of the Col5a1 gene in osteoblastic cells. Conversely, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Sp7/Osterix decreased the promoter activity and the endogenous mRNA levels of the Col5a1 gene. These effects on promoter activity were canceled when the mutant construct of Sp1 binding site was introduced. Consistent with these data, the experiments using an osteoblast differentiation model showed increased promoter activity and endogenous mRNA levels, along with increased Sp7/Osterix during differentiation. Therefore, type V collagen appears to be involved in bone formation.",

     "abstract": "The sequence encoding the N-propeptide of collagen I is characterized by significant conservation of amino acids across species; however, the function of the N-propeptide remains poorly defined. Studies in vitro have suggested that one activity of this propeptide might be to act as a feedback inhibitor of collagen I synthesis. To determine whether the N-propeptide contributed to decreased collagen content in SPARC-null mice, mice carrying a deletion of exon 2, which encodes the globular domain of the N-propeptide of collagen I, were crossed to SPARC-null animals. Mice lacking SPARC and expressing collagen I without the globular domain of the N-propeptide were viable and fertile. However, a significant number of animals developed abdominal hernias within the first 2\u00a0months of life with an approximate 20% penetrance (~\u00a035% of males). The dermis of SPARC-null/exon 2-deleted mice was thinner and contained fewer large collagen fibers in comparison with wild-type or in either single transgenic animal. The average collagen fibril diameter of exon 2-deleted mice did not significantly differ from wild-type mice (WT: 87.9\u00a0nm versus exon 2-deleted: 88.2\u00a0nm), whereas SPARC-null/exon 2-deleted fibrils were smaller than that of SPARC-null dermis (SPARC-null: 60.2\u00a0nm, SPARC-null/exon 2-deleted: 40.8\u00a0nm). As measured by hydroxyproline analysis, double transgenic skin biopsies contained significantly less collagen than those of wild-type, those of exon 2-deleted, and those of SPARC-null biopsies. Acetic acid extraction of collagen from skin biopsies revealed an increase in the proportion of soluble collagen in the SPARC-null/exon 2-deleted mice. These results support a function of the N-propeptide of collagen I in facilitating incorporation and stabilization of collagen I into the insoluble ECM and argue against a primary function of the N-propeptide as a negative regulator of collagen synthesis.",

Here we demonstrate that specific domains of tenascin-C inhibit fibronectin matrix assembly whereas full-length tenascin-C does not. These domains act via distinct mechanisms: TNfn1-8 blocks fibrillogenesis by binding to fibronectin fibrils and preventing intermolecular fibronectin interactions whilst FBG acts independently of binding to fibronectin and instead is internalized and causes cytoskeletal re-organization. We also show that TNfn1-8 disrupts epithelial cell tubulogenesis. Our data demonstrate that tenascin-C contains cryptic sites which can control tissue levels of fibrillar fibronectin either by preventing de novo fibril assembly or reducing levels of deposited fibronectin.

Experimental and computational models of FGF2 binding kinetics to both cells and BM under static conditions are well established in the literature but remain largely unexplored under flow. We now examine BM-FGF2 binding kinetics in fluid flow conditions. We hypothesized that FGF2 binding to the endothelial BM would decrease as fluid shear stress increased. To investigate this, BM-FGF2 equilibrium, associative, and dissociative bindings were measured at various shear stresses. Surprisingly, FGF2 binding increased up to a physiological arterial shear stress of 25\u00a0dynes/cm2, after which it decreased to a level similar to the 1\u00a0dyne/cm2 condition. Both BM-FGF2 dissociation and BM binding site availability increased with flow, while association remained constant. This suggests that force-dependent FGF2 equilibrium binding varies with shear stress due to a combination of an increase in binding site availability and FGF2 dissociation with flow. This improved understanding of BM-FGF2 binding with flow enriches current knowledge of FGF2 binding kinetics under physiologic conditions, which may contribute to improved growth factor therapy development.",

Many non-histone proteins are also targeted for acetylation, including TGF-\u03b2 signalling pathway components such as Smad2, Smad3 and Smad7. Our studies in mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts suggested that a number of TGF-\u03b2-induced genes that regulate matrix turnover are selectively regulated by HDACs. Blockade of HDAC activity with trichostatin A (TSA) abrogated the induction of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12 (Adam12) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (Timp-1) genes by TGF-\u03b2, whereas plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (Pai-1) expression was unaffected. Analysis of the activation of cell signalling pathways demonstrated that TGF-\u03b2 induced robust ERK and PI3K activation with delayed kinetics compared to the phosphorylation of Smads. The TGF-\u03b2 induction of Adam12 and Timp-1 was dependent on such non-Smad signalling pathways and, importantly, HDAC inhibitors completely blocked their activation without affecting Smad signalling. Analysis of TGF-\u03b2-induced Adam12 and Timp-1 expression and ERK/PI3K signalling in the presence of semi-selective HDAC inhibitors valproic acid, MS-275 and apicidin implicated a role for class I HDACs. Furthermore, depletion of HDAC3 by RNA interference significantly down-regulated TGF-\u03b2-induced Adam12 and Timp-1 expression without modulating Pai-1 expression. Correlating with the effect of HDAC inhibitors, depletion of HDAC3 also blocked the activation of ERK and PI3K by TGF-\u03b2. Collectively, these data confirm that HDACs, and in particular HDAC3, are required for activation of the ERK and PI3K signalling pathways by TGF-\u03b2 and for the subsequent gene induction dependent on these signalling pathways.",

Conversely, IL-1\u03b1 reduced mRNA and protein expression of ADAMTS1, a metalloproteinase that suppresses neovascularization. IL-1\u03b1 increased expression of TIMP-1 slightly, but not TIMP-2. Data for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-10 and ADAMTS1 were confirmed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1), another important myocardial proinflammatory cytokine, did not alter expression of these metalloproteinases. IL-1\u03b1 strongly activated the p38 MAPK pathway in human CMF. Pharmacological inhibitors of p38-\u03b1/\u03b2 (SB203580) or p38-\u03b1/\u03b2/\u03b3/\u03b4 (BIRB-0796) reduced MMP-3 and ADAMTS1 mRNA expression, but neither inhibitor affected MMP-9 levels. MMP-1 and MMP-10 expression were inhibited by BIRB-0796 but not SB203580, suggesting roles for p38-\u03b3/\u03b4.In summary, IL-1\u03b1 induces a distinct pattern of ECM protein and protease expression in human CMF, in part regulated by distinct p38 MAPK subtypes, affirming the key role of IL-1\u03b1 and CMF in post-infarction cardiac remodeling.",

To investigate the molecular mechanisms leading to cutis laxa in vivo, we generated transgenic mice by pronuclear injection of minigenes encoding normal human tropoelastin (WT) or tropoelastin with a cutis laxa mutation (CL). Three independent founder lines of CL mice showed emphysematous pulmonary airspace enlargement. No consistent dermatological or cardiovascular pathologies were observed. One CL and one WT line were selected for detailed studies. Both mutant and control transgenic animals showed elastin deposition into pulmonary elastic fibers, indicated by increased desmosine levels in the lung and by colocalization of transgenic and endogenous elastin by immunostaining. CL mice showed increased static lung compliance and decreased stiffness of lung tissue. In addition, markers of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling and the unfolded protein response (UPR) were elevated together with increased apoptosis in the lungs of CL animals. We conclude that the synthesis of mutant elastin in CL activates multiple downstream disease pathways by triggering a UPR, altered mechanical signaling, increased release of TGF\u03b2 and apoptosis. We propose that the combined effects of these processes lead to the development of an emphysematous pulmonary phenotype in CL.",

     "abstract": "The heparan sulfate (HS) chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) are \u201cubiquitous\u201d components of the cell surface and the extracellular matrix (EC) and play important roles in the physiopathology of developmental and homeostatic processes. Most biological properties of HS are mediated by interactions with \u201cheparin-binding proteins\u201d and can be modulated by exogenous heparin species (unmodified heparin, low molecular weight heparins, shorter heparin oligosaccharides and various non-anticoagulant derivatives of different sizes). Heparin species can promote or inhibit HS activities to different extents depending, among other factors, on how closely their structure mimics the biologically active HS sequences. Heparin shares structural similarities with HS, but is richer in \u201cfully sulfated\u201d sequences (S domains) that are usually the strongest binders to heparin/HS-binding proteins. On the other hand, HS is usually richer in less sulfated, N-acetylated sequences (NA domains). Some of the functions of HS chains, such as that of activating proteins by favoring their dimerization, often require short S sequences separated by rather long NA sequences. The biological activities of these species cannot be simulated by heparin, unless this polysaccharide is appropriately chemically/enzymatically modified or biotechnologically engineered. This mini review covers some information and concepts concerning the interactions of HS chains with heparin-binding proteins and some of the approaches for modulating HS interactions relevant to inflammation and cancer. This is approached through a few illustrative examples, including the interaction of HS and heparin-derived species with the chemokine IL-8, the growth factors FGF1 and FGF2, and the modulation of the activity of the enzyme heparanase by these species. Progresses in sequencing HS chains and reproducing them either by chemical synthesis or semi-synthesis, and in the elucidation of the 3D structure of oligosaccharide\u2013protein complexes, are paving the way for rational approaches to the development of HS-inspired drugs in the field of inflammation and cancer, as well in other therapeutic fields.",

It remains unclear whether bone shortening and deformities are caused solely by changes in the cartilage matrix, or whether chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan undersulfation affects also signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore we studied macromolecular sulfation in the different zones of the dtd mouse growth plate and these data were related to growth plate histomorphometry and proliferation analysis.A 2-fold increase of non-sulfated disaccharide in dtd animals compared to wild-type littermates in the resting, proliferative and hypertrophic zones was detected indicating proteoglycan undersulfation; among the three zones the highest level of undersulfation was in the resting zone. The relative height of the hypertrophic zone and the average number of cells per column in the proliferative and hypertrophic zones were significantly reduced compared to wild-types; however the total height of the growth plate was within normal values. The chondrocyte proliferation rate, measured by bromodeoxyuridine labelling, was also significantly reduced in mutant mice. Immunohistochemistry combined with expression data of the dtd growth plate demonstrated that the sulfation defect alters the distribution pattern, but not expression, of Indian hedgehog, a long range morphogen required for chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation.These data suggest that in dtd mice proteoglycan undersulfation causes reduced chondrocyte proliferation in the proliferative zone via the Indian hedgehog pathway, therefore contributing to reduced long bone growth.",

The aim of the present study is to identify the role of perlecan in skeletal muscle hypertrophy and myostatin signaling, with and without mechanical stress, using a mouse model (Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg) deficient in skeletal muscle perlecan. We found that myosin heavy chain (MHC) type IIb fibers in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice had a significantly increased fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) compared to control (WT-Tg) mice. Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice also had an increased number of type IIx fibers in the TA muscle. Myostatin and its type I receptor (ALK4) expression was substantially decreased in the Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg TA muscle. Myostatin-induced Smad activation was also reduced in a culture of myotubes from the Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg muscle, suggesting that myostatin expression and its signaling were decreased in the Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg muscle. To examine the effects of mechanical overload or unload on fast and slow muscles in Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice, we performed tenotomy of the plantaris (fast) muscle and the soleus (slow) muscle. Mechanical overload on the plantaris muscle of Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice significantly increased wet weights compared to those of control mice, and unloaded plantaris muscles of Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice caused less decrease in wet weights compared to those of control mice. The decrease in myostatin expression was significantly profound in the overloaded plantaris muscle of Hspg2\u2212/\u2212-Tg mice, compared with that of control mice. In contrast, overloading the soleus muscle caused no changes in either type of muscle.

     "abstract": "Basement membranes (BMs) are physiologically insoluble extracellular matrix sheets present in all multicellular organisms. They play an important role in providing mechanical strength to tissues and regulating cell behavior. Proteomic analysis of BM proteins is challenged by their high molecular weights and extensive post-translational modifications. Here, we describe the direct analysis of an in vivo BM system using a mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics approach. Retinal BMs were isolated from embryonic chick eyes. The BM macromolecules were deglycosylated and separated by low percentage gradient SDS PAGE, in-gel digested and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. This identified over 27 extracellular matrix proteins in the retinal BM. A semi-quantitative measure of protein abundance distinguished, nidogens-1 and -2, laminin subunits \u03b11, \u03b15, \u03b22, and \u03b31, agrin, collagen XVIII, perlecan, FRAS1 and FREM2 as the most abundant BM protein components. Laminin subunits \u03b13, \u03b21, \u03b32, \u03b33 and collagen IV subunits \u03b15 and \u03b16 were minor constituents. To examine binding interactions that contribute to the stability of the retinal BM, we applied the LC-MS/MS based approach to detect potential BM complexes from the vitreous. Affinity-captured nidogen- and heparin-binding proteins from the vitreous contained >\u00a010 and >\u00a0200 proteins respectively. Comparison of these protein lists with the retinal BM proteome reveals that glycosaminoglycan and nidogen binding interactions play a central role in the internal structure and formation of the retinal BM. In addition, we studied the biomechanical qualities of the retinal BM before and after deglycosylation using atomic force microscopy. These results show that the glycosaminoglycan side chains of the proteoglycans play a dominant role in regulating the thickness and elasticity of the BMs by binding water to the extracellular matrix. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale investigation of an in vivo BM system using MS-based proteomics.",

Endocytosis is thought to play an essential role in the catabolism of HA due to the intracellular compartmentalization of the HA degrading hyaluronidase enzymes. Previous investigations have shown that keratinocytes, chondrocytes and breast tumor cell lines endocytose HA via the cell surface glycoprotein, CD44. However, other cell types endocytose HA using a CD44-independent mechanism that remains to be defined. The purpose of this study was to investigate HA endocytosis in B16-F10 melanoma cells. We found that B16-F10 melanoma cells expressed CD44 on their surfaces. Unexpectedly, CD44 did not play a role in the endocytosis of HA. Electron microscopy studies revealed that B16-F10 melanoma cells exhibited membrane ruffling, a characteristic feature of macropinocytosis, only after incubating the cells with the HA co-polymer. Moreover, B16-F10 melanoma cells endocytosed HA via macropinocytosis as assessed by drug inhibition studies and the co-localization of fluorescently labeled HA with fluorescent tracers under confocal microscopy. Based on these results, we conclude that induced macropinocytosis may provide a previously unrecognized avenue for HA endocytosis in some cell types.",

Fibrillar collagen cross-linking is a product of the enzymatic activities of lysyl oxidase (LOX and LOXL-3) released by the cardiac fibroblast and possibly cardiac myocytes. Our hypothesis is that stimulation of the TH1 lymphocytes activates lysyl oxidase mediated ECM cross-linking and thereby alters left ventricular function. Three-month old C57BL/J female mice were treated with selective TH1 lymphocyte inducers \u2014 T-cell receptor V\u03b2 peptides (TCR). After 6\u00a0weeks, candidate gene expression, tissue enzymatic activity, ECM composition, and left ventricular mechanics were quantified. Lymphocyte gene expression and cytokine assay revealed TH1 immune polarization with TCR administration which was associated with a 2.6-fold and 3.1-fold increase of LOX and LOXL3 gene expression, respectively, and a 55% increase in cardiac LOX enzymatic activity. The ECM cross-linked fibrillar collagen increased by 95% when compared with the control. Concurrently, there was a 33% increased ventricular stiffness, decreased cardiac output, and normal ejection fraction.

Distribution of collagen type I and fibronectin in the ECM of the agarose cultures was determined by immunoflorescence. Collagen fibril and keratocyte morphology was evaluated by electron microscopy. The agarose overlay significantly enhanced the cell number in the IGF-I, TGF-\u03b2 and PDGF treated cultures by 2\u20133 fold. The overlay also significantly enhanced the processing of procollagen to collagen fibrils from 29% in standard cultures to 63\u201368% in agarose cultures for the IGF-I and PDGF cultures, and from 66% in standard culture to 85% in agarose culture for the TGF-\u03b2 cultures. Cell accumulation and collagen processing was not enhanced by agarose overlay of the FGF-2 treated cultures. Collagen type I and fibronectin were more uniformly distributed and the collagen fibrils smaller in the ECM of the TGF-\u03b2 treated cultures. Keratocytes in the FGF-2 treated cultures were in close cell contact with few collagen fibrils while IGF-I, TGF-\u03b2, and PDGF cultures had an extensive ECM with abundant collagen fibrils. The results of this study indicate that the agarose overlay enhances collagen fibril assembly and cell accumulation by keratocytes when both collagen synthesis and cell proliferation are stimulated.",

This study aimed to characterise the cellular insult of suturing and acellular zone formation in mouse tendon. Acellular zone formation was evaluated using single grasping sutures placed using flexor tendons with time lapse cell viability imaging for a period of 12\u00a0h. Both tension and injury were required to induce cell death and cell movement in the formation of the acellular zone. DNA fragmentation studies and transmission electron microscopy indicated that cells necrosed.Parallel in vivo studies showed that cell-to-cell contacts were disrupted following grasping by the suture in tensioned tendon. Without tension, cell death was lessened and cell-to-cell contacts remained intact. Quantitative immunohistochemistry and 3D cellular profile mapping of wound healing markers over a one year time course showed that acellular zones arise rapidly and showed no evidence of healing whilst the wound healing response occurred in the surrounding tissues. The acellular zones were also evident in a standard modified \u201cKessler\u201d clinical repair. In conclusion, the suture repair of injured tendons produces acellular zones, which may potentially cause early tendon failure.",

     "abstract": "Fibrosis is a frequent complication of diabetes mellitus in many organs and tissues but the mechanism of how diabetes-induced glycation of extracellular matrix proteins impacts the formation of fibrotic lesions is not defined. As fibrosis is mediated by myofibroblasts, we investigated the effect of collagen glycation on the conversion of human cardiac fibroblasts to myofibroblasts. Collagen glycation was modeled by the glucose metabolite, methylglyoxal (MGO). Cells cultured on MGO-treated collagen exhibited increased activity of the \u03b1-smooth muscle actin promoter and enhanced expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, ED-A fibronectin and cadherin, which are markers for myofibroblasts. In cells remodeling floating or stress-relaxed collagen gels, MGO treatment promoted more contraction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.025) than vehicle controls, which was MGO dose-dependent. Transwell assays showed that cell migration was increased by MGO-treated collagen (p\u00a0<\u00a00.025). In shear-force detachment assays, cells on MGO-treated collagen were less adherent than untreated collagen, and the formation of high affinity, \u03b21 integrin-dependent adhesions was inhibited. MGO-collagen-induced expression of SMA was dependent on TGF-\u03b2 but not on Rho kinase. We conclude that collagen glycation augments the formation and migration of myofibroblasts, critical processes in the development of fibrosis in diabetes.",

     "abstract": "The matricellular protein thrombospondin-2 (TSP2) inhibits proliferation and enhances osteoblastogenesis of multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPC). Osteoblastogenesis and adipogenesis are reciprocally regulated, thus we hypothesized that TSP2 could be an inhibitor of adipogenesis. TSP2 gene expression is up-regulated during MPC osteoblast differentiation and down-regulated during adipogenic differentiation through a cAMP\u2013PKA pathway, relative to control cells. Next, the importance of TSP2 in adipogenesis was studied by comparing gene-targeted knockout mice that lack TSP2 protein (TSP2-null) and control wild-type mice. TSP2-null marrow-derived MPC show 25% increased adipocytes. Similarly, TSP2-null adipose-derived MPC show increased adipocytes (25\u201350%) and proliferation (2-fold) relative to wild-type cells. However, the increase in TSP2-null adipocytes is not due to an increase in MPC number, because the percentage of adipocytes relative to total MPC is still significantly increased. Surprisingly, there are only minor alterations in the adipogenic transcriptional program (PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1 expression). Weight gain over time was evaluated in TSP2-null and control wild-type mice fed normal and high-fat diets. Female TSP2-null mice are 30% heavier than wild-type controls due to an increase in non-visceral adipose tissue, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and direct weighing of fat pads. These results show that TSP2 is an endogenous matricellular protein produced by MPC that in addition to enhancing osteoblastogenesis, inhibits adipocytes and decreases subcutaneous adiposity.",

Recently, we reported that Pl-nectin is a new member of the discoidin family, in agreement with the notion that many discoidin-containing proteins are involved in cell adhesion processes as integrin ligands. To better understand the molecular basis for the interaction of Pl-nectin with ectoderm, we investigated the hypothesis that Pl-nectin is an integrin ligand in sea urchin embryos. We show that in P. lividus embryos, \u03b2C-containing integrins localize to the apical surface of ectodermic cells, which are in contact with Pl-nectin. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that the two proteins are part of a complex in vivo and affinity chromatography indicates that \u03b2C-containing integrin receptors bind purified Pl-nectin. These data support a model in which ectodermic integrins binding to Pl-nectin mediate cellular adhesion to the hyaline layer. Regulated adhesion of cells to the hyaline layer is a critical component of several morphogenetic processes and the identification of the receptors and ligands involved provides new opportunities to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of ECM adhesion and morphogenesis.",

The present study evaluates the role of Discoidin Domain Receptor 1 (DDR1) in cell\u2013matrix interaction involved in pathogenesis of Alport syndrome including renal inflammation and fibrosis.DDR1/COL4A3 Double-knockouts were compared to COL4A3\u2212/\u2212 mice with 50% or 100% expression of DDR1, wildtype controls and to DDR1\u2212/\u2212 COL4A3+/+ controls for over 6\u00a0years. Double-knockouts lived 47% longer, mice with 50% DDR1 lived 29% longer and showed improved renal function (reduction in proteinuria and blood urea nitrogen) compared to animals with 100% DDR1 expression. Loss of DDR1 reduced proinflammtory, profibrotic cells via signaling of TGF\u03b2, CTGF, NF\u03baB and IL-6 and decreased deposition of extracellular matrix. Immunogold-staining and in-situ hybridisation identified podocytes as major players in DDR1-mediated fibrosis and inflammation within the kidney.In summary, glomerular epithelial cells (podocytes) express DDR1. Loss of DDR1-expression in the kidney delayed renal fibrosis and inflammation in hereditary type IV collagen disease. This supports our hypothesis that podocyte\u2013matrix interaction via collagen receptors plays an important part in progression of renal fibrosis in Alport disease. The blockade of collagen-receptor DDR1 might serve as an important new therapeutic concept in progressive fibrotic and inflammatory diseases in the future.",

In this study we identified fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2, large modular structural glycoproteins, as components of the extracellular matrix of peripheral nerve. Previously it was found that fibrillin-2 null mice display joint contractures, suggesting a possible defect of the peripheral nervous system in these animals. Close examination of the peripheral nerves of fibrillin-2 deficient animals described here revealed some structural abnormalities in the perineurium, while general structure of the nerve and molecular composition of nerve extracellular matrix remained unchanged. We also found that in spite of the obvious motor function impairment, fibrillin-2 null mice failed to display changes of nerve conduction properties or nerve regeneration capacity. Based on the data obtained we can conclude that peripheral neuropathy should be excluded as the cause of the impairment of locomotory function and joint contractures observed in fibrillin-2 deficient animals.",

Syndecan-4, a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, is associated to focal adhesions in adherent cells and has been described as a marker of satellite cells in skeletal muscle. In this tissue, \u03b21 integrin forms heterodimers with \u03b15 and \u03b16 during myoblast differentiation and with \u03b17 in adult muscle. Here, we show that the levels of these two cell surface membrane molecules are regulated by spontaneous electrical activity during the differentiation of rat primary myoblasts. Syndecan-4 and \u03b21 integrin protein levels decrease after the inhibition of electrical activity using tetrodotoxin (TTX). Syndecan-4 also decreases substantially in denervated rat tibialis anterior muscle. Indirect immunofluorescence analysis shows that syndecan-4 and \u03b21 integrin co-localize with vinculin, a molecular marker of costameres in skeletal muscle myofibers. Co-localization is lost in inactive myotubes adopting a diffuse pattern, suggesting that the costameric organization is disrupted in TTX-treated myotubes. Moreover, the inhibition of spontaneous electrical activity decreases myotube cell adhesion. In summary, this work shows that syndecan-4 and \u03b21 integrin protein levels and their localization in costameric structures are regulated by electrical activity and suggests that this regulatory mechanism influences the adhesion properties of skeletal myotubes during differentiation.",

In this study we investigated the molecular interactions of LTBP-2 with heparin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) since unidentified cell surface HSPGs are critical for normal fiber assembly. In solid phase assays, heparin conjugated to albumin (HAC) bound strongly to recombinant full-length human LTBP-2. This interaction was completely blocked by addition of excess heparin, but not chondroitin sulfate, confirming specificity. Analysis of binding to LTBP-2 fragments showed that HAC bound strongly to N-terminal fragment LTBP-2 NT(H) and more weakly to central fragment LTBP-2 C(H). No binding was detected to C-terminal fragment LTBP-2 CT(H). Kds for heparin binding were calculated for full-length LTBP-2, LTBP-2 NT(H) and LTBP-2 C(H) as 0.9\u00a0nM, 0.7\u00a0nM and 80\u00a0nM respectively. HAC interaction with fragment LTBP-2 NT(H) was not sensitive to EDTA or EGTA indicating that binding had no requirement for Ca2+ ions whereas HAC binding to fragment LTBP-2 C(H) was markedly reduced by these chelating agents indicating a degree of Ca2+ dependence. Inhibition studies with synthetic peptides identified three major heparin binding sequences in fragment LTBP-2 NT(H), including sequence LTEKIKKIKIV in the first large cysteine-free domain of LTBP-2, adjacent to the previously identified fibulin-5 binding site.

To find out whether BMs maintain their ultrastructure, protein composition and biophysical properties throughout life the natural aging history of the human inner limiting membranes (ILM) was investigated. The ILM is a BM at the vitreal surface of the retina that connects the retina with the vitreous. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the ILM steadily increases in thickness from 70\u00a0nm at fetal stages to several microns at age 90. By the age of 20, the ILM loses its laminated structure to become an amorphous and very irregular extracellular matrix layer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the native, hydrated ILMs are on average 4-fold thicker than the dehydrated ILMs as seen by TEM and that their thickness is prominently determined by its water-binding proteoglycans. The morphological changes are accompanied by age-related changes in the biochemical composition, whereby the relative concentrations of collagen IV and agrin increase, and the concentration of laminin decreases with age. Force-indentation measurements by AFM also showed that ILMs become increasingly stiffer with advancing age. The data suggest that BMs from other human tissues may undergo similar age-related changes.",

These tissues differentiate with reciprocal signaling interactions to form a mature tooth. In this study we have characterized ameloblast differentiation in human developing incisors, and have further investigated the role of extracellular matrix proteins on ameloblast differentiation. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses showed that in the human tooth, the basement membrane separating the early developing dental epithelium and mesenchyme was lost shortly before dentin deposition was initiated, prior to enamel matrix secretion. Presecretary ameloblasts elongated as they came into contact with the dentin matrix, and then shortened to become secretory ameloblasts. In situ hybridization showed that the presecretory stage of odontoblasts started to express type I collagen mRNA, and also briefly expressed amelogenin mRNA. This was followed by upregulation of amelogenin mRNA expression in secretory ameloblasts. In vitro, amelogenin expression was upregulated in ameloblast lineage cells cultured in Matrigel, and was further up-regulated when these cells/Matrigel were co-cultured with dental pulp cells. Co-culture also up-regulated type I collagen expression by the dental pulp cells. Type I collagen coated culture dishes promoted a more elongated ameloblast lineage cell morphology and enhanced cell adhesion via integrin \u03b12\u03b21. Taken together, these results suggest that the basement membrane proteins and signals from underlying mesenchymal cells coordinate to initiate differentiation of preameloblasts and regulate type I collagen expression by odontoblasts. Type I collagen in the dentin matrix then anchors the presecretary ameloblasts as they further differentiate to secretory cells. These studies show the critical roles of the extracellular matrix proteins in ameloblast differentiation.",

Here we examine the effects of reduced loading of rat hindlimbs on articular cartilage expression of MMP-3, which not only digests matrix components but also activates other proteolytic enzymes. We show that hindlimb immobilization resulted in elevated MMP-3 mRNA expression at 6\u00a0h that was sustained throughout the 21\u00a0day immobilization period. MMP-3 upregulation was higher in the medial condyle than the lateral, and was greatest in the superficial cartilage zone, followed by middle and deep zones. These areas also showed decreases in safranin O staining, consistent with reduced cartilage proteoglycan content, as early as 7\u00a0days after immobilization. One hour of daily moderate mechanical loading, applied as passive joint motion, reduced the MMP-3 and ADAMTS-5 increases that resulted from immobilization, and also prevented changes in safranin O staining. Intra-articular injections of an MMP-3 inhibitor, N-isobutyl-N-(4-methoxyphenylsulfonyl)-glycylhydroxamic acid (NNGH), dampened the catabolic effects of a 7\u00a0day immobilization period, indicating a likely requirement for MMP-3 in the regulation of proteoglycan levels through ADAMTS-5.

Direct measurement of aggrecan core protein length and chondroitin sulfate chain length by single molecule atomic force microscopy imaging revealed that, independent of age, BMSCs produced longer core protein and longer chondroitin sulfate chains, and fewer short core protein molecules than chondrocytes, suggesting that the BMSC-produced aggrecan has a phenotype more characteristic of young tissue than chondrocyte-produced aggrecan. Aggrecan ultrastructure, ECM composition, and cellular proliferation combine to suggest a mechanism by which BMSCs produce a superior cartilage-like neo-tissue than either young or adult chondrocytes.",

Although the major fibrillar collagen types I\u2013III comprise only clade A chains, the minor fibrillar collagen types V and XI comprise both clade A chains and the clade B chains pro-\u03b11(V), pro-\u03b13(V), pro-\u03b11(XI) and pro-\u03b12(XI), in which defects can underlie various genetic connective tissue disorders. Here we characterize the clade B procollagen chains of zebrafish. We demonstrate that in contrast to the four tetrapod clade B chains, zebrafish have six clade B chains, designated here as pro-\u03b11(V), pro-\u03b13(V)a and b, pro-\u03b11(XI)a and b, and pro-\u03b12(XI), based on synteny, sequence homologies, and features of protein domain and gene structures. Spatiotemporal expression patterns are described, as are conserved and non-conserved features that provide insights into the function and evolution of the clade B chain types. Such features include differential alternative splicing of NH2-terminal globular sequences and the first case of a non-triple helical imperfection in the COL1 domain of a clade B, or clade A, fibrillar procollagen chain. Evidence is also provided for previously unknown and evolutionarily conserved alternative splicing within the pro-\u03b11(V) C-propeptide, which may affect selectivity of collagen type V/XI chain associations in species ranging from zebrafish to human. Data presented herein provide insights into the nature of clade B procollagen chains and should facilitate their study in the zebrafish model system.",

This led to the identification of extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1) as a novel COMP-associated partner. COMP directly binds to ECM1 both in vitro and in vivo. The EGF domain of COMP and the C-terminus of ECM1 mediate the interaction between them. COMP and ECM1 colocalize in the growth plates invivo. ECM1 inhibits chondrocyte hypertrophy, matrix mineralization, and endochondral bone formation, and COMP overcomes the inhibition by ECM1. In addition, COMP-mediated neutralization of ECM1 inhibition depends on their interaction, since COMP largely fails to overcome the ECM1 inhibition in the presence of the EGF domain of COMP, which disturbs the association of COMP and ECM1. These findings provide the first evidence linking the association of COMP and ECM1 and the biological significance underlying the interaction between them in regulating endochondral bone growth.",

Electroneutral sodium-bicarbonate co-transporter (NBCn1) is expressed in inactive osteoclasts, but its physiological role in bone resorption has remained unknown. We show here that NBCn1, encoded by the SLC4A7 gene, is directly involved in bone resorption. NBCn1 protein was specifically found at the bone-facing ruffled border areas, and metabolic acidosis increased NBCn1 expression in rats in vivo. In human hematopoietic stem cell cultures, NBCn1 mRNA expression was observed only after formation of resorbing osteoclasts. To further confirm the critical role of NBCn1 during bone resorption, human hematopoietic stem cells were transduced with SLC4A7 shRNA lentiviral particles. Downregulation of NBCn1 both on mRNA and protein level by lentiviral shRNAs significantly inhibited bone resorption and increased intracellular acidification in osteoclasts. The lentiviral particles did not impair osteoclast survival, or differentiation of the hematopoietic or mesenchymal precursor cells into osteoclasts or osteoblasts in vitro. Inhibition of NBCn1 activity may thus provide a new way to regulate osteoclast activity during pathological bone resorption.",

In this study, full-length recombinant mouse DSPP was made for the first time in furin-deficient mammalian LoVo cells and used to test the ability of three different isoforms of one candidate protease, bone morphogenetic protein-1 (BMP1) to cleave DSPP at the appropriate site. Furthermore, two reported enhancers of BMP1/mTLD activity (procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer-1, PCPE-1, and secreted frizzled-related protein-2, sFRP2) were tested for their abilities to modulate BMP1-mediated processing of both DSPP and another SIBLING family member with a similar cleavage motif, dentin matrix protein-1 (DMP1). Three splice variants of BMP1 (classic BMP1, the full-length mTolloid (mTLD), and the shorter isoform lacking the CUB3 domain, BMP1-5) were all shown to cleave the recombinant DSPP in vitro although mTLD was relatively inefficient at processing both DSPP and DMP1. Mutation of the MQGDD peptide motif to IEGDD completely eliminated the ability of all three recombinant isoforms to process full-length recombinant DSPP in vitro thereby verifying the single predicted cleavage site. Furthermore when human bone marrow stromal cells (which naturally express furin-activated BMP1) were transduced with the adenovirus-encoding either wild-type or mutant DSPP, they were observed to fully cleave wild-type DSPP but failed to process the mutant DSPPMQ\u0394IE during biogenesis. All three BMP1 isoforms were shown to process type I procollagen as well as DSPP and DMP1 much more efficiently in low-salt buffer (\u2264\u00a050\u00a0mM NaCl) compared to commonly used normal saline buffers (150\u00a0mM NaCl). Neither PCPE-1 nor sFRP2 were able to enhance any of the three BMP1 isoforms in cleaving either DSPP or DMP1 under either low or normal saline conditions. Interestingly, we were unable to reproduce sFRP2's reported ability to enhance the processing of type I procollagen by BMP1/mTLD. In summary, three isoforms of BMP1 process both DSPP and DMP1 at the MQX/DDP motif, but the identity of a protein that can enhance the cleavage of the two SIBLING proteins remains elusive.",

Analysis of Adamts9+/LacZ adult mice revealed anomalies in the aortic wall, valvulosinus and valve leaflets. Abnormal myocardial projections and \u2018spongy\u2019 myocardium consistent with non-compaction of the left ventricle were also found in Adamts9+/LacZ mice. During development, Adamts9 was expressed in derivatives of the Secondary Heart Field, vascular smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall, mesenchymal cells of the valves, and non-myocardial cells of the ventricles, but expression also continued in the adult heart and ascending aorta. Thus, the adult cardiovascular anomalies found in Adamts9+/LacZ hearts could result from subtle developmental alterations in extracellular matrix remodeling or defects in adult homeostasis. The valvular and aortic anomalies of Adamts9+/LacZ hearts were associated with accumulation of versican and a decrease in cleaved versican relative to WT littermates. These data suggest a potentially important role for ADAMTS9 cleavage of versican, or other, as yet undefined substrates in development and allostasis of cardiovascular extracellular matrix. In addition, these studies identify ADAMTS9 as a potential candidate gene for congenital cardiac anomalies. Mouse models of ADAMTS9 deficiency may be useful to study myxomatous valve degeneration.",

GAG mimetics called RGTAs (for ReGeneraTing Agents) have been shown to stimulate tissue repair. In particular they accelerate myogenesis, in part via their heparin-mimetic property towards growth factors. RGTAs also increase activity of calcium-dependent intracellular protease suggesting an effect on calcium cellular homeostasis. This effect was presently investigated on myoblasts in vitro using one member of the RGTA family molecule named OTR4120. We have shown that OTR4120 or heparin induced transient increases of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in pre-fusing myoblasts from both mouse SolD7 cell line and rat skeletal muscle satellite cells grown in primary culture by mobilising sarcoplasmic reticulum store. This [Ca2+]i was not mediated by ryanodine receptors but instead resulted from stimulation of the Inositol-3 phosphate-phospholipase C activation pathway. OTR4120-induced calcium transient was not mediated through an ATP, nor a tyrosine kinase, nor an acetylcholine receptor but principally through serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. This original finding shows that the GAG mimetic can induce calcium signal through serotonin receptors and the IP3 pathway may be relevant to its ability to favour myoblast differentiation. It supports a novel and unexpected function of GAGs in the regulation of calcium homeostasis.",

     "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) hydrolysis catalysed by hyaluronidase (HAase) is strongly inhibited when performed at a low ratio of HAase to HA concentrations and at low ionic strength. This is because long HA chains can form non-active complexes with HAase. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is able to compete with HAase to form electrostatic complexes with HA so freeing HAase which then recovers its catalytic activity. This BSA-dependence is characterised by two main domains separated by the optimal BSA concentration: below this concentration the HAase activity increases when the BSA concentration is increased, above this concentration the HAase activity decreases. This occurs provided that HA is negatively charged and BSA is positively charged, i.e. in a pH range from 3 to 5.25. The higher the pH value the higher the optimal BSA concentration. Other proteins can also modulate HAase activity. Lysozyme, which has a pI higher than that of BSA, is also able to compete with HAase to form electrostatic complexes with HA and liberate HAase. This occurs over a wider pH range that extends from 3 to 9. These results mean that HAase can form complexes with HA and recover its enzymatic activity at pH as high as 9, consistent with HAase having either a high pI value or positively charged patches on its surface at high pH. Finally, the pH-dependence of HAase activity, which results from the influence of pH on both the intrinsic HAase activity and the formation of complexes between HAase and HA, shows a maximum at pH 4 and a significant activity up to pH 9.",

We have previously characterized a 3\u00a0kb human \u03b111 promoter region in vitro. In the current study we generated promoter-LacZ reporter transgenic mice to examine the ability of the 3\u00a0kb \u03b111 promoter to drive tissue-specific expression also in vivo. Our data show that the 3 kb \u03b111 promoter contains most of the regulatory elements that direct ectomesenchymal and mesodermal fibroblast-specific expression.Not much is known about integrin \u03b111 regulation by TGF-\u03b2 family members and the potential role of \u03b111 in TGF-\u03b21 driven processes such as fibrosis and wound contraction. In the current study we show that TGF-\u03b21 induces \u03b111 transcription in the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 as well as in primary fibroblasts. Co-transfection of an expression plasmid encoding constitutively active ALK5 together with \u03b111 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs demonstrated that TGF-\u03b21 responsive elements are located within the 3\u00a0kb \u03b111 promoter. Serial deletions located TGF-\u03b21 responsiveness to the proximal promoter (nt \u2212176/+25) as well as to the region extending to nt \u2212330. Transfection and expression of the inhibitory Smad7 in the cells attenuated the TGF-\u03b21-dependent \u03b111 induction both at the RNA and the protein level. Mutation and deletion analyses identified a Smad-binding element, SBE2 (nt \u2212182/\u2212176), as an important Smad3-binding site in this part of the promoter. Further analyses suggested that the Sp1-binding site SBS1 (nt \u2212140/\u2212134) takes part in the responsiveness to TGF-\u03b21 in a Smad2-dependent manner.In summary, our data confirm that 3\u00a0kb of the \u03b111 promoter is efficient in driving tissue-specific expression in vivo. We also demonstrate that this promoter confers TGF-\u03b21 responsiveness which appears to rely on both a Smad-binding element at nt \u2212182/\u2212176 and a Sp1-binding site at nt \u2212140/\u2212134.

This is characterized by increased numbers of collagen-producing ISEMF causing an uncontrolled, irreversible wound-healing response to the chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Reconstitution of the original ECM leads ISEMF to exit this cycle. In contrast, during fibrosis, ISEMF persist. It is known that ISEMF produce and deposit collagen types I, III, IV and V; however synthesis and the role of fibrillar peripheral molecules like collagen type XVI have not been addressed yet. Here, we have analyzed the distribution of collagen XVI in the normal and inflamed bowel wall, its gene and protein expression by ISEMF of different inflammation stages, the cell\u2013matrix interactions in different phases of the inflammatory process and their effect on cell spreading, proliferation and migration. Collagen XVI is deposited in the submucosa of the intestinal wall where it co-localizes with fibrillin-1 and integrin \u03b11. ISEMF reveal increasing gene and protein expression of collagen XVI concurrent to increasing inflammation. ISEMF reveal more mature focal adhesion contacts when seeded on collagen XVI resulting in an extensive cell spreading. This involves recruitment of \u03b11\u03b21 integrin, which shows increased cell surface expression on ISEMF in late stages of inflammation. We assume that collagen XVI promotes persistence of ISEMF in the normal and, even stronger in the inflamed bowel wall by stabilizing focal adhesion contacts via cell\u2013matrix interaction preferentially through recruitment of \u03b11\u00df1 integrin into the tips of the focal adhesion contacts.",

The goal of this paper is therefore to provide quantitative biochemical data from these tissues as a reference for further studies.

     "abstract": "Human tooth contains a distinct population of neural crest-derived progenitor cells (dNC-PCs) which are known to give rise to specialized daughter cells of an osteogenic lineage. We hypothesised that dNC-PCs could develop into neural crest-derived bone in a self-propagating and extracorporal culture system. Thus, we examined the three-dimensional structure obtained from osteogenic-stimulated dNC-PCs by morphological, biochemical and spectroscopic methods. After the onset of stimulation, cells formed a multilayer with outer cells covering the surface and inner cells secreting a hyaline matrix. With prolonged culture, multilayers contracted and formed a three-dimensional construct which subsequently converted to a calcified mass. Differentiation of progenitor cells was associated with apoptosis. Cell types which survived were smooth muscle actin-positive cells and bone-like cells. The expression of osteoblastic markers and the secretion of a collagenous matrix indicate that the bone cells had acquired their functional phenotype. Furthermore, these cells produced and secreted membrane-bound vesicles into the newly forming matrix. Consequently, an early biomineralized extracellular matrix was found with calcium phosphate deposits being associated with the newly formed collagen matrix framework. The molar calcium\u2013phosphorus-ratio of the mineralized collagen indicated that amorphous calcium phosphate was present within this matrix. The data suggest that stimulated cultures of dNC-PCs are able to recapitulate some processes of the early phase of osteogenesis.",

Small molecules required for lens cell metabolism, such as glucose, salts, and waste products, freely pass through the capsule. However, the lens capsule is selectively permeable to proteins such as growth hormones and substrate carriers which are required for proper lens growth and development. We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to characterize the diffusional behavior of various sized dextrans (3, 10, 40, 150, and 250\u00a0kDa) and proteins endogenous to the lens environment (EGF, \u03b3D-crystallin, BSA, transferrin, ceruloplasmin, and IgG) within the capsules of whole living lenses. We found that proteins had dramatically different diffusion and partition coefficients as well as capsule matrix binding affinities than similar sized dextrans, but they had comparable permeabilities. We also found ionic interactions between proteins and the capsule matrix significantly influence permeability and binding affinity, while hydrophobic interactions had less of an effect. The removal of a single anionic residue from the surface of a protein, \u03b3D-crystallin [E107A], significantly altered its permeability and matrix binding affinity in the capsule. Our data indicated that permeabilities and binding affinities in the lens capsule varied between individual proteins and cannot be predicted by isoelectric points or molecular size alone.",

     "abstract": "Zebrafish gastrulation entails morphogenetic cell movements that shape the body plan and give rise to an embryo with defined anterior\u2013posterior and dorsal\u2013ventral axes. Regulating these cell movements are diverse signaling pathways and proteins including Wnts, Src-family tyrosine kinases, cadherins, and matrix metalloproteinases. While our knowledge of how these proteins impact cell polarity and migration has advanced considerably in the last decade, almost no data exist regarding the organization of extracellular matrix (ECM) during zebrafish gastrulation. Here, we describe for the first time the assembly of a fibronectin (FN) and laminin containing ECM in the early zebrafish embryo. This matrix was first detected at early gastrulation (65% epiboly) in the form of punctae that localize to tissue boundaries separating germ layers from each other and the underlying yolk cell. Fibrillogenesis increased after mid-gastrulation (80% epiboly) coinciding with the period of planar cell polarity pathway-dependent convergence and extension cell movements. We demonstrate that FN fibrils present beneath deep mesodermal cells are aligned in the direction of membrane protrusion formation. Utilizing antisense morpholino oligonucleotides, we further show that knockdown of FN expression causes a convergence and extension defect. Taken together, our data show that similar to amphibian embryos, the formation of ECM in the zebrafish gastrula is a dynamic process that occurs in parallel to at least a portion of the polarized cell behaviors shaping the embryonic body plan. These results provide a framework for uncovering the interrelationship between ECM structure and cellular processes regulating convergence and extension such as directed migration and mediolateral/radial intercalation.",

Its potential role in the context of peritoneal injury following long-term peritoneal dialysis is unclear. We used an adenovirus expressing the B chain of PDGF (AdPDGF-B) to assess its effect on pro-fibrotic pathways in the peritoneal membrane. To assess the transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 independent effects of PDGF, we over-expressed PDGF-B in the peritoneum of either wild-type mice (Smad3+/+) or those with a deletion of the TGF\u03b2 signaling protein Smad3 (Smad3\u2212/\u2212). PDGF-B induced sustained angiogenesis in both Smad3+/+ and Smad3\u2212/\u2212 mice. Despite increased collagen gene expression, collagen accumulation was transient and fibrogenesis was associated with induction of collagenase activity. We observed epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) involving the peritoneal mesothelial cells, as shown by increased SNAIL and decreased E-Cadherin expression with evidence of mesothelial cells expressing both epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Unlike TGF\u03b2-induced EMT, PDGF-B exposure did not lead to mobilization of the mesothelial cells; they remained as a single monolayer throughout the observation period. This \u201cnon-invasive\u201d EMT phenomenon is a novel finding and may have implications concerning the role of EMT in peritoneal fibrosis and injury to other organ systems. The observed effects were similar in Smad3\u2212/\u2212 and Smad3+/+ animals, suggesting that the PDGF-B effects were independent of TGF\u03b2 or Smad signaling.",

Studies have confirmed that oligosaccharides of HA (o-HA) are capable of stimulating neovascularization in vitro and promoting blood flow or angiogenesis in animal models. However, few laboratories have studied the function of o-HA as an exogenous treatment in injured tissue repair in vivo. It is thought that o-HA may lose its activities when used topically in vivo due to its small size, which may be absorbed quickly by the surrounding tissues. In this study, we prepared a special slow-releasing gel that contains a mixture of defined size of o-HA and studied the healing effects of o-HA by topical application to an acute wound model. We report that o-HA complex promotes the repair of tissue injury of a murine excisional dermal wound. The therapy by o-HA was compared with high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA) and the known angiogenesis stimulator, VEGF. At days 6 to 8 after treatment, significant differences were seen in wound closure rates between o-HA and control or HMW-HA groups, in which o-HA showed an increased wound recovery. Histological analysis revealed that increased neo-blood and lymph vessels were formed in wounded tissues treated by o-HA. In addition, treatments of wounds with o-HA resulted in more granulation production, collagen deposition, and fibroblast proliferation. Analysis of gene expression by real-time RT-PCR demonstrated a significant up-regulation of some cytokines or adhesion molecules in o-HA-treated wounds, which corresponds with the increased granulation tissue in these wounds. Our findings suggested that o-HA therapy may be useful in acute wound repair.",

Thus, a marginal p38-independent adipogenesis on native collagen I matrix contrasts with an efficient p38-dependent differentiation on denatured collagen I. An efficient Hsp90-dependent osteogenesis occurs on native collagen I matrix but not on its denatured counterpart where it is insignificant and proceeds in an Hsp90-independent manner. Whereas only marginal osteogenesis and no detectable adipogenesis of bone marrow stromal cells occur on native collagen IV, the same matrix supports a highly efficient adipogenesis in denatured structural state. The present study addresses the opposite direction in the flow of cell\u2013matrix interaction, namely the cells' influence on structural state of collagen matrix, and tests the possibility that differentiating bone marrow stromal cells may adjust the expression phenotype of MMP and TIMP in such a way that, if translated into matrix modification, would facilitate the maintenance of collagen matrix in or its modification into structural state optimal for the ongoing differentiation process. The results obtained indicate that this is indeed the case. In bone marrow stromal cells stimulated to undergo adipogenesis the expression of MMP increases and that of TIMP decreases. In cells induced to undergo osteogenesis the opposite is true: MMP/TIMP expression is adjusted in a manner that, if translated into matrix modification, could promote the native structural conformation optimal for this type of differentiation. The results obtained also indicate that the observed adjustment in MMP/TIMP expression phenotype might be an early differentiation event and that differentiation stimulation alone might be sufficient to trigger it even on matrices not favorable to a given type of differentiation.

     "abstract": "Collagen IV is the major matrix component associated with differentiating adipocytes in adipose tissues, and the understanding of its contribution in adipogenic differentiation could be important for elucidation of mechanisms and processes driving the obesity. Therefore, in the light of our previous findings of differential effects of structural conformation of collagen I matrix on differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells, we investigated whether similar phenomenon occurs on collagen IV matrix in native and denatured structural states. The results of the present study show that native collagen IV is unsupportive of adipogenic differentiation and very little if any adipogenesis occurs on this matrix in the presence of adipogenic stimuli. In sharp contrast to native collagen IV, the same matrix in denatured structural state drives highly efficient adipogenic differentiation suggesting that it might be the major driver of adipogenesis in adipose tissues and that the ratio of native to denatured matrix might regulate the intensity of adipogenesis and possibly underlies the obesity. In contrast to observations that adipogenesis on denatured collagen I (collagen I is the major matrix component in musculoskeletal tissues) is suppressed by stress, adipogenesis on denatured collagen IV appears to be stress-resistant suggesting an explanation for the observed ineffectiveness of physical exercise, i.e. mechanical stress, in the reduction of adipose tissues. The obesity was shown to be associated with overproduction of MMPs and decline in levels of TIMPs. Such a shift in MMP/TIMP balance was considered a consequence of the pathology. In the light of the present study, however, this shift might constitute the primary source of the decease.

To address this problem, we utilized an in vitro model in which type I collagen was reconstituted and overlaid with fibronectin. Either the collagen or fibronectin was fluorescently-labeled. ECM remodeling by fibroblasts deficient in LRP1, uPAR, or MT1-MMP was studied. MT1-MMP was required for efficient remodeling of the deep collagen layer but not involved in fibronectin remodeling. Instead, fibronectin was remodeled by a system that required urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), uPAR, and exogenously-added plasminogen. LRP1 markedly inhibited fibronectin remodeling by regulating cell-surface uPAR and plasminogen activation. LRP1 also regulated remodeling of the deep collagen layer but not by controlling MT1-MMP. Instead, LRP1 deficiency or inhibition de-repressed a secondary pathway for collagen remodeling, which was active in MT1-MMP-deficient cells but not in uPAR-deficient cells. These results demonstrate that LRP1 regulates ECM remodeling principally by repressing pathways that require plasminogen activation by uPA in association with uPAR.",

In chicken tenascin-C, meprin\u03b2 processed all three major splicing variants by removal of 10\u00a0kDa N-terminal and 38\u00a0kDa C-terminal peptides, leaving a large central part of subunits intact. A similar cleavage pattern was found for large human tenascin-C variant where two N-terminal peptides (10 or 15\u00a0kDa) and two C-terminal fragments (40 and 55\u00a0kDa) were removed from the intact subunit. N-terminal sequencing revealed the exact amino acid positions of cleavage sites. In both chicken and human tenascin-C N-terminal cleavages occurred just before and/or after the heptad repeats involved in subunit oligomerization. In the human protein, an additional cleavage site was identified in the alternative fibronectin type III repeat D. Whereas all these sites are known to be attacked by several other proteases, a unique cleavage by meprin\u03b2 was located to the 7th constant fibronectin type III repeat in both chicken and human tenascin-C, thereby removing the C-terminal domain involved in its anti-adhesive activity. In cell adhesion assays meprin\u03b2-digested human tenascin-C was not able to interfere with fibronectin-mediated cell spreading, confirming cleavage in the anti-adhesive domain.

Through the application of a transactivation reporter assay, we also provide a molecular proof that increased TGF\u03b2 (Transforming Growth Factor \u03b2) signalling is tightly associated with downregulation of iduronate sulfatase function. Our results provide an insight into the early biological impairments underlying the Hunter syndrome and suggest the use of zebrafish as a novel tool to better understand lysosomal storage disorder pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed to elucidate the role of charge in mediating chondrocyte response to loading by employing synthetic 3D hydrogels. Specifically, neutral poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels were employed where negatively charged chondroitin sulfate (ChS), one of the main extracellular matrix components of cartilage, was systematically incorporated into the PEG network at 0%, 20% or 40% to control the fixed charge density. PEG hydrogels were employed as a control environment for extracellular events which occur as a result of loading, but which are not associated with a charged matrix (e.g., cell deformation and fluid flow). Freshly isolated bovine articular chondrocytes were embedded in the hydrogels and subject to dynamic mechanical stimulation (0.3\u00a0Hz, 15% amplitude strains, 6\u00a0h) and assayed for nitric oxide production, cell proliferation, proteoglycan synthesis, and collagen deposition. In the absence of loading, incorporation of charge inhibited cell proliferation by ~\u00a075%, proteoglycan synthesis by ~\u00a022\u201350% depending on ChS content, but had no affect on collagen deposition. Dynamic loading had no effect on cellular responses in PEG hydrogels. However, dynamically loading 20% ChS gels inhibited nitrite production by 50%, cell proliferation by 40%, but stimulated proteoglycan and collagen deposition by 162% and 565%, respectively. Dynamic loading of 40% ChS hydrogels stimulated nitrite production by 62% and proteoglycan synthesis by 123%, but inhibited cell proliferation by 54% and collagen deposition by 52%. Upon removing the load and culturing under free-swelling conditions for 36\u00a0h, the enhanced matrix synthesis observed in the 20% ChS gels was not maintained suggesting that loading is necessary to stimulate matrix production. In conclusion, extracellular events associated with a charged matrix have a dramatic affect on how chondrocytes respond to mechanical stimulation within these artificial 3D matrices suggesting that streaming potentials and/or dynamic changes in osmolarity may be important regulators of chondrocytes while cell deformation and fluid flow appear to have less of an effect.",

     "abstract": "The potent oxidants hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypobromous acid (HOBr) are produced extracellularly by myeloperoxidase, following release of this enzyme from activated leukocytes. The subendothelial extracellular matrix is a key site for deposition of myeloperoxidase and damage by myeloperoxidase-derived oxidants, with this damage implicated in the impairment of vascular cell function during acute inflammatory responses and chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis. The heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan, a key component of the subendothelial extracellular matrix, regulates important cellular processes and is a potential target for HOCl and HOBr. It is shown here that perlecan binds myeloperoxidase via its heparan sulfate side chains and that this enhances oxidative damage by myeloperoxidase-derived HOCl and HOBr. This damage involved selective degradation of the perlecan protein core without detectable alteration of its heparan sulfate side chains, despite the presence of reactive GlcNH2 residing within this glycosaminoglycan. Modification of the protein core by HOCl and HOBr (measured by loss of immunological recognition of native protein epitopes and the appearance of oxidatively-modified protein epitopes) was associated with an impairment of its ability to support endothelial cell adhesion, with this observed at a pathologically-achievable oxidant dose of 425\u00a0nmol oxidant/mg protein. In contrast, the heparan sulfate chains of HOCl/HOBr-modified perlecan retained their ability to bind FGF-2 and collagen V and were able to promote FGF-2-dependent cellular proliferation. Collectively, these data highlight the potential role of perlecan oxidation, and consequent deregulation of cell function, in vascular injuries by myeloperoxidase-derived HOCl and HOBr.",

     "publication date": "01-2010",
     "abstract": "In the study of aggrecan fragmentation several methods to extract and purify aggrecan from cartilage and synovial fluid (SF) are used. This work compares and evaluates the effectiveness for purification of aggrecan of the most commonly used methods by the ratio of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) to protein and by fragment analysis by Western blot. A novel method for purification of aggrecan fragments from SF by boiling (Boiled SF) is also presented.Of the sGAG extracted from cartilage by guanidinium, 66% was recovered by associative\u2013dissociative cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (A1D1\u2013D3) with a 9 times higher ratio of sGAG to protein in the A1D1 fraction. Although less enriched in aggrecan, the Western blot aggrecan pattern of the guanidinium extracted sample resembled that of the combined patterns of the A1D1, A1D2 and A1D3 fractions.The recoveries of sGAG from SF purified by anion chromatography and Alcian blue precipitation were around 50%, while the recoveries were over 80% in the associative or dissociative density gradient fractions (A1 and D1) and Boiled SF. The purification compared to neat SF ranged from 9 times in boiled SF to 1800\u20131900 times in Alcian blue and D1 samples. To obtain reliable results when analyzing synovial fluid aggrecan fragments by Western blot, purification was necessary. The immuno-pattern of anion chromatography purified SF resembled the patterns of A1 and D1, while the pattern of Boiled SF resembled the D1 sample.This work suggests that aggrecan fragments extracted from cartilage by guanidinium need no further purification to be analyzed by Western blot, whereas aggrecan fragments in SF are best analyzed in the A1 and D1 fractions or in the Boiled SF sample.",
