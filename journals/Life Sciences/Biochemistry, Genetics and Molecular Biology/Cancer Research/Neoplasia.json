     "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a malignant cancer with an unknown etiology and an unfavorable prognosis. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, thus making it essential to find novel curative targets for CCA. Metabolic reprogramming of the tumor cells includes metabolic abnormalities in glucose (known as the Warburg effect) and other substances such as amino acids and fats. Metabolic reprogramming produces anti-oxidant substances, reduces tumor oxidative stress, and finally promotes the proliferation of tumors. There is increasing evidence to imply that SIRT2, a histone deacetylase, and its downstream target cMYC, play metabolic regulatory roles in tumor cells. However, the role of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA is unclear. To assess the metabolic reprogramming function of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA and to determine the downstream targets as well as evaluate the therapeutic effect, the CCA RNA-Seq data were downloaded from the TCGA database. Differentially expressed genes were confirmed and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Overall, 48 paired CCA samples were collected and subjected to immunohistochemical detection, and the clinical characteristics of participants were summarized. The CCA cells were suppressed or overexpressed with different downstream targets of SIRT2 and then subjected to apoptosis, immunoblotting, seahorse, and metabolites tracing analysis. In vivo experiments were also performed. We found that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway contributed to the proliferation of CCA cells and confirmed that the downstream target is PHDA1 and the serine synthesis pathway. The up-regulated SIRT2 and cMYC levels resulted in low levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increased conversion of glucose to serine and led to poor patient survival. The highly active SIRT2/cMYC pathway up-regulated the serine synthesis pathway pyruvate and increased antioxidant production, thus consequently protecting the CCA cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Our data revealed that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway plays a critical role in transforming glucose oxidative metabolism to serine anabolic metabolism, thus providing antioxidants for stress resistance. SIRT2/cMYC-induced metabolic reprogramming may represent a new therapeutic target for treating CCA.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma is highly heterogeneous in microstructure and vasculature, creating various tumor microenvironments among patients, which may lead to different phenotypes. The purpose was to interrogate the interdependence of microstructure and vasculature using perfusion and diffusion imaging and to investigate the utility of this approach in tumor invasiveness assessment. A total of 115 primary glioblastoma patients were prospectively recruited for preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and surgery. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was calculated from diffusion imaging, and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) was calculated from perfusion imaging. The empirical copula transform was applied to ADC and rCBV voxels in the contrast-enhancing tumor region to obtain their joint distribution, which was discretized to extract second-order features for an unsupervised hierarchical clustering. The lactate levels of patient subgroups, measured by MR spectroscopy, were compared. Survivals were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The results showed that three patient subgroups were identified by the unsupervised clustering. These subtypes showed no significant differences in clinical characteristics but were significantly different in lactate level and patient survivals. Specifically, the subtype demonstrating high interdependence of ADC and rCBV displayed a higher lactate level than the other two subtypes (P\u202f=\u202f.016 and P\u202f=\u202f.044, respectively). Both subtypes of low and high interdependence showed worse progression-free survival than the intermediate (P\u202f=\u202f.046 and P\u202f=\u202f.009 respectively). Our results suggest that the interdependence between perfusion and diffusion imaging may be useful in stratifying patients and evaluating tumor invasiveness, providing overall measure of tumor microenvironment using multiparametric MRI.",

     "abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is an important process of tumor progression associated with increased metastatic potential. EMT can be activated by external triggers such as cytokines or metabolic parameters (e.g. hypoxia). Since extracellular acidosis is a common finding in tumors, the aim of the study is to analyze its impact on the expression of EMT markers in vitro and in vivo as well as the functional impact on cell adhesion. Therefore, three tumor and two normal epithelial cell lines were incubated for 24 h at pH 6.6 and the expression of EMT markers was studied. In addition, mRNA expression of transcription and metabolic factors related to EMT was measured as well as the functional impact on cell adhesion, either during acidic incubation or after priming cells in an acidic milieu. E-cadherin and N-cadherin were down-regulated in all tumor and normal cell lines studied, whereas vimentin expression increased in only two tumor and one normal cell line. Down-regulation of the cadherins was seen in total protein and to a lesser extent in surface protein. In vivo an increase in N-cadherin and vimentin expression was found. Acidosis up-regulated Twist1 and Acsl1 but down-regulated fumarate hydratase (Fh). Cell adhesion during acidic incubation decreased in AT1 prostate carcinoma cells whereas preceding acidic priming increased their subsequent adhesion. Low tumor pH is able to modulate the expression EMT-related proteins and by this may affect the stability of the tissue structure.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a lethal brain tumor with a mean survival time of 1 year. One major reason for therapeutic failure is that GBM cells have an extraordinary capacity to invade normal brain tissue beyond the surgical margin, accounting for the lack of treatment efficacy. GBM cells that can infiltrate into the healthy brain possess tumor properties of stemness and invasion, and previous studies demonstrate that Musashi-1 (MSI1), a neural stem cell marker, plays an important role in the maintenance of stem cell status, cellular differentiation, and tumorigenesis in cancers. By analyzing neuronal progenitor cell markers and stemness genes, we predicted that MSI1 might be an important factor in GBM pathogenesis. Because inflammation aids in the proliferation and survival of malignant cells, the inflammatory microenvironment also promotes GBM invasion, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is involved in inflammation. Our results indicate that the above phenomena are likely due to MSI1 upregulation, which occurred simultaneously with higher expression of ICAM1 in GBM cells. Indeed, MSI1 knockdown effectively suppressed ICAM1 expression and blocked GBM cell motility and invasion, whereas overexpressing ICAM1 reversed these effects. According to RNA immunoprecipitation assays, MSI1-mediated mRNA interactions promote ICAM1 translation. Finally, immunohistochemical analysis showed MSI1 and ICAM-1 to be coexpressed at high levels in GBM tissues. Thus, the MSI1/ICAM1 pathway plays an important role in oncogenic resistance, including increased tumor invasion, and MSI1/ICAM1 may be a target for GBM treatment.",

     "abstract": "Leukemogenic potential of MLL fusion with the coiled-coil domain-containing partner genes and the downstream target genes of this type of MLL fusion have not been clearly investigated. In this study, we demonstrated that the coiled-coil\u2013four-helix bundle structure of EB1 that participated in the MLL/EB1 was required for immortalizing mouse bone marrow (BM) cells and producing myeloid, but not lymphoid, cell lines. Compared to MLL/AF10, MLL/EB1 had low leukemogenic ability. The MLL/EB1 cells grew more slowly owing to increased apoptosis in vitro and induced acute monocytic leukemia with an incomplete penetrance and longer survival in vivo. A comparative analysis of transcriptome profiling between MLL/EB1 and MLL/AF10 cell lines revealed that there was an at least two-fold difference in the induction of 318 genes; overall, 51.3% (163/318) of the genes were known to be bound by MLL, while 15.4% (49/318) were bound by both MLL and MLL/AF9. Analysis of the 318 genes using Gene Ontology\u2013PANTHER overrepresentation test revealed significant differences in several biological processes, including cell differentiation, proliferation/programmed cell death, and cell homing/recruitment. The Ets1 gene, bound by MLL and MLL/AF9, was involved in several biological processes. We demonstrated that Ets1 was selectively upregulated by MLL/EB1. Short hairpin RNA knockdown of Ets1 in MLL/EB1 cells reduced the expression of CD115, apoptosis rate, competitive engraftment to BM and spleen, and incidence of leukemia and prolonged the survival of the diseased mice. Our results demonstrated that MLL/EB1 upregulated Ets1, which controlled the balance of leukemia cells between apoptosis and BM engraftment/clonal expansion.Novelty and impact of this studyThe leukemogenic potential of MLL fusion with cytoplasmic proteins containing coiled-coil dimerization domains and the downstream target genes of this type of MLL fusion remain largely unknown. Using a retroviral transduction/transplantation mouse model, we demonstrated that MLL fusion with the coiled-coil\u2013four-helix bundle structure of EB1 has low leukemogenic ability; Ets1, which is upregulated by MLL/EB1, plays a critical role in leukemic transformation by balance between apoptosis and BM engraftment/clonal expansion.",

     "abstract": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are abundant stromal cells in tumor microenvironment that are critically involved in cancer progression. Contrasting reports have shown that CAFs can have either pro- or antitumorigenic roles, indicating that CAFs are functionally heterogeneous. Therefore, to precisely target the cancer-promoting CAF subsets, it is necessary to identify specific markers to define these subpopulations and understand their functions. We characterized two CAFs subsets from 28 non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient tumors that were scored and classified based on desmoplasia [mainly characterized by proliferating CAFs; high desmoplastic CAFs (HD-CAF; n\u202f=\u202f15) and low desmoplastic CAFs (LD-CAF; n\u202f=\u202f13)], which is an independent prognostic factor. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that HD-CAFs and LD-CAFs show different tumor-promoting abilities. HD-CAFs showed higher rate of collagen matrix remodeling, invasion, and tumor growth compared to LD-CAFs. Transcriptomic analysis identified 13 genes that were differentially significant (fold \u22651.5; adjusted P value < .1) between HD-CAFs and LD-CAFs. The top upregulated differentially expressed gene, ST8SIA2 (11.3 fold; adjusted P value\u202f=\u202f.02), enhanced NSCLC tumor cell invasion in 3D culture compared to control when it was overexpressed in CAFs, suggesting an important role of ST8SIA2 in cancer cell invasion. We confirmed the protumorigenic role of ST8SIA2, showing that ST8SIA2 was significantly associated with the risk of relapse in three independent NSCLC clinical datasets. In summary, our studies show that functional heterogeneity in CAF plays key role in promoting cancer cell invasion in NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "TP63 (p63), a member of the tumor suppressor TP53 (p53) gene family, is essential for ectodermal tissue development and suppresses malignant progression of carcinomas. The most abundant isoform, \u0394Np63\u03b1 (referred to as p63), lacks the N-terminal transactivation (TA) domain, and was originally characterized as a dominant-negative type suppressor against p53 family proteins. It also binds to TCF/LEF to inhibit \u03b2-catenin. Nevertheless, transcriptional activation by p63 has also been observed in varied systems. To understand the puzzling results, we analyzed the structure\u2013function relationship of p63 in the control of \u03b2-catenin-dependent transcription. p63 acted as a suppressor of moderately induced \u03b2-catenin. However, when nuclear targeted S33Y \u03b2-catenin was applied to cause the maximum enhancer activation, p63 displayed a \u03b2-catenin-coactivating function. The DNA-binding domain of p63 and the target sequence facilitated it. Importantly, we newly found that, despite the absence of TA domain, p63 was associated with p300, a general adaptor protein and chromatin modifier causing transcriptional activation. C-terminal \u03b1 domain of p63 was essential for p300-binding and for the coactivator function. These results were related to endogenous p63-p300 complex formation and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-responsive gene regulation by p63 in squamous cell carcinoma lines. The novel p63-p300 interaction may be involved in positive regulation of gene expression in tissue development and carcinogenesis.",

In this study, we investigated whether homodimers or heterodimers, and which ligand, play a major role in cancer development, with the goal of ultimately identifying therapeutic targets. We demonstrated that the ErbB3 ligand heregulin1 is the strongest mitogenic factor for non\u2013small cell lung cancer cells and is more potent in activating EGFRmut-ErbB3 heterodimers than EGFRwt-ErbB3 heterodimers. We discovered that four of the seven EGFR ligands inhibited heregulin1-induced EGFRwt-ErbB3 activation and cell proliferation by promoting dephosphorylation of heregulin1-induced ErbB3 phosphorylation, whereas the other three did not exhibit such inhibition. Importantly, those four EGFR ligands did not inhibit heregulin1-induced EGFRmut-ErbB3 activation and proliferation of cells with EGFR mutants. We demonstrated that ErbB3 was overexpressed in the lung cancer cells but not in the adjacent normal alveoli or stromal tissue. EGFR and heregulin1 were also highly expressed in lung cancer cells. We conclude that the overexpression of heregulin1, ErbB3, and EGFR mutant renders uncontrolled cell proliferation.",

     "abstract": "CDK regulatory subunit 2 (CKS2) has a nuclear function that promotes cell division and is a candidate biomarker of chemoradioresistance in cervical cancer. The underlying mechanisms are, however, not completely understood. We investigated whether CKS2 also has a mitochondrial function that augments tumor aggressiveness. Based on global gene expression data of two cervical cancer cohorts of 150 and 135 patients, we identified a set of genes correlated with CKS2 expression. Gene set enrichment analysis showed enrichment of mitochondrial cellular compartments, and the hallmarks oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and targets of the MYC oncogene in the gene set. By in situ proximity ligation assay, we showed that CKS2 formed complex with the positively correlated MYC target, mitochondrial single-stranded DNA binding protein SSBP1, in the mitochondrion of cervix tumor samples and HeLa and SiHa cervical cancer cell lines, indicating a role in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and thereby OXPHOS. CDK1 was found to be part of the complex. Flow cytometry analyses of HeLa cells showed cell cycle regulation of the CKS2-SSBP1 complex consistent with mtDNA replication activity. Moreover, repression of mtDNA replication and OXPHOS by acute hypoxia decreased CKS2-SSBP1 complex abundance and expression of MYC targets. By immunohistochemistry, cytoplasmic CKS2 expression was found to add to the prognostic impact of nuclear CKS2 expression in patients, suggesting that the mitochondrial function promotes tumor aggressiveness. Our study uncovers a novel link between regulation of cell division by nuclear pathways and OXPHOS in the mitochondrion that involves CKS2 and promotes chemoradioresistance of cervical cancer.",

     "abstract": "Paclitaxel is a frontline drug for the treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, following paclitaxel-platinum based chemotherapy, tumor recurrence occurs in most ovarian cancer patients. Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a hallmark of cancer and represents genetic variation fueling tumor adaptation to cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs. In this study, our Kaplan-Meier analysis including 263 ovarian cancer patients (stages I/II) revealed that high Polo-like kinase (PLK) 1 expression correlates with bad prognosis. To evaluate the role of PLK1 as potential cancer target within a combinatorial trial, we induced strong mitotic arrest in ovarian cancer cell lines by synergistically co-targeting microtubules (paclitaxel) and PLK1 (BI6727) followed by pharmaceutical inhibition of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC/C) using proTAME. In short- and long-term experiments, this triple treatment strongly activated apoptosis in cell lines and primary ovarian cells derived from cancer patients. Mechanistically, BI6727/paclitaxel/proTAME stabilize Cyclin B1 and trigger mitotic arrest, which initiates mitochondrial apoptosis by inactivation of antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, followed by activation of caspase-dependent effector pathways. This triple treatment prevented endoreduplication and reduced CIN, two mechanisms that are associated with aggressive tumors and the acquisition of drug resistance.

To address this gap in knowledge, we conducted a preclinical prevention trial of calcitriol in the 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO) oral carcinogenesis model. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to the carcinogen 4NQO in drinking water for 16 weeks and randomized to control (4NQO only) or calcitriol arms. Calcitriol (0.1 \u03bcg i.p, Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) was administered for (i) 16 weeks concurrently with 4NQO exposure, (ii) 10 weeks post completion of 4NQO exposure, and, (iii) a period of 26 weeks concurrent with and following 4NQO exposure. Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to monitor disease progression until end point (week 26). Correlative histopathology of tongue sections was performed to determine incidence and multiplicity of oral dysplastic lesions and squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Vitamin D metabolites and calcium were measured in the serum using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS/MS) and colorimetric assay, respectively. Renal CYP24A1 (24-hydroxylase) and CYP27B1 (1\u03b1-hydroxylase) expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Immunostaining of tongue sections for vitamin D receptor (VDR), CYP24A1, and Ki67 was also performed. Non-invasive MRI enabled longitudinal assessment of lesions in the oral cavity. Calcitriol administered concurrently with 4NQO for 16 weeks significantly (P\u202f<\u202f.001) decreased the number of premalignant lesions by 57% compared to 4NQO only controls. Mice treated with calcitriol for 26 weeks showed highest renal CYP24A1, lowest serum 1,25(OH)2D3 levels and highest incidence of invasive SCC. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased VDR, CYP24A1 and Ki67 staining in dysplastic epithelia compared to normal epithelium, in all four groups.

     "abstract": "Chromosomal aneuploidy is a defining feature of carcinomas and results in tumor-entity specific genomic imbalances. For instance, most sporadic colorectal carcinomas carry extra copies of chromosome 7, an aneuploidy that emerges already in premalignant adenomas, and is maintained throughout tumor progression and in derived cell lines. A comprehensive understanding on how chromosomal aneuploidy affects nuclear organization and gene expression, i.e., the nucleome, remains elusive. We now analyzed a cell line established from healthy colon mucosa with a normal karyotype (46,XY) and its isogenic derived cell line that acquired an extra copy of chromosome 7 as its sole anomaly (47,XY,+7). We studied structure/function relationships consequent to aneuploidization using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), RNA sequencing and protein profiling. The gain of chromosome 7 resulted in an increase of transcript levels of resident genes as well as genome-wide gene and protein expression changes. The Hi-C analysis showed that the extra copy of chromosome 7 is reflected in more interchromosomal contacts between the triploid chromosomes. Chromatin organization changes are observed genome-wide, as determined by changes in A/B compartmentalization and topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Most notably, chromosome 4 shows a profound loss of chromatin organization, and chromosome 14 contains a large A/B compartment switch region, concurrent with resident gene expression changes. No changes to the nuclear position of the additional chromosome 7 territory were observed when measuring distances of chromosome painting probes by interphase FISH. Genome and protein data showed enrichment in signaling pathways crucial for malignant transformation, such as the HGF/MET-axis. We conclude that a specific chromosomal aneuploidy has profound impact on nuclear structure and function, both locally and genome-wide. Our study provides a benchmark for the analysis of cancer nucleomes with complex karyotypes.",

Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of samples from breast cancer patients showed that the expression of LOXL2 was positively correlated with lymphatic vessel density and breast cancer malignancy. In animal studies, LOXL2-overexpressing breast cancer cells significantly increased lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis, whereas knockdown of LOXL2 suppressed both processes. In order to study the mechanisms of lymphangiogenesis progression, we performed further in vitro investigations and the data revealed that LOXL2 significantly enhanced lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) invasion and tube formation through directly activation of the Akt-Snail and Erk pathways. Moreover, LOXL2 also stimulated fibroblasts to secrete high level of pro- lymphangiogenic factors VEGF-C and SDF-1\u03b1. Taken together, our study elucidates a novel function of tumor cell secreted LOXL2 in lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis, demonstrating that LOXL2 serves as a promising target for anti-lymphangiogenesis and anti-metastasis therapies for breast cancer.",

In particular, the Traf2 and Nck-interacting kinase (TNIK) was markedly upregulated and phosphorylated on multiple sites upon ERG overexpression. Importantly, TNIK has not previously been implicated in prostate cancer. To validate the clinical relevance of these findings, we characterized expression of TNIK and TNIK phosphorylated at serine 764 (pS764) in a localized prostate cancer patient cohort and showed that nuclear enrichment of TNIK (pS764) was significantly positively correlated with ERG expression. Moreover, TNIK protein levels were dependent upon ERG expression in VCaP cells and primary cells established from a prostate cancer patient-derived xenograft. Furthermore, reduction of TNIK expression and activity by silencing TNIK expression or using the TNIK inhibitor NCB-0846 reduced cell viability, colony formation and anchorage independent growth. Therefore, TNIK represents a novel and actionable therapeutic target for ERG-positive prostate cancers that could be exploited to develop new treatments for these patients.",

Recent studies suggest that wild-type KRAS and HRAS isoforms could majorly contribute to HCC progression and sorafenib resistance. In contrast, the role of neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) in HCC remained elusive. In this study, wild-type NRAS was found to be overexpressed in HCC cell lines, preclinical HCC models, and human HCC tissues. Moreover, NRAS overexpression correlated with poor survival and proliferation in vivo. However, si-RNA-pool\u2013mediated NRAS knockdown showed only slight effects on HCC proliferation, clonogenicity, and AKT activity. We determined that KRAS upregulation served as a functional compensatory mechanism in the absence of NRAS, which was overcome by combined inhibition of NRAS and KRAS in HCC cells. Furthermore, NRAS expression was elevated in sorafenib-resistant compared to nonresistant HCC cells, and NRAS knockdown enhanced sorafenib efficacy in resistant cells. In summary, NRAS appears to be a prognostic marker in HCC and contributes to sorafenib resistance. Regarding potential therapeutic strategies, NRAS inhibition in HCC should be combined with KRAS inhibition to prevent KRAS-mediated rescue effects.",

     "abstract": "Dysfunctional inflammatory pathways are associated with an increased risk of cancer, including colorectal cancer. We have previously identified and enriched for a self-renewing, colon cancer stem cell (CCSC) subpopulation in primary sporadic colorectal cancers (CRC) and a related subpopulation in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients defined by the stem cell marker, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Subsequent work demonstrated that CCSC-initiated tumors are dependent on the inflammatory chemokine, CXCL8, a known inducer of tumor proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion. Here, we use RNA interference to target CXCL8 and its receptor, CXCR1, to establish the existence of a functional signaling pathway promoting tumor growth initiated by sporadic and colitis CCSCs. Knocking down either CXCL8 or CXCR1 had a dramatic effect on inhibiting both in vitro proliferation and angiogenesis. Likewise, tumorigenicity was significantly inhibited due to reduced levels of proliferation and angiogenesis. Decreased expression of cycle cell regulators cyclins D1 and B1 along with increased p21 levels suggested that the reduction in tumor growth is due to dysregulation of cell cycle progression. Therapeutically targeting the CXCL8-CXCR1 signaling pathway has the potential to block sustained tumorigenesis by inhibiting both CCSC- and pCCSC-induced proliferation and angiogenesis.",

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are thought to differentiate into two main phenotypes: proinflammatory M1 and protumorigenic M2. Currently, the prognostic impact of TAMs and their M1 and M2 phenotypes is unclear in non\u2013small cell cancer (NSCLC). The present study was set up to evaluate an approach for identifying common M1 and M2 macrophage markers and explore their clinical significance in NSCLC. Using multiplex chromogenic immunohistochemistry, tissue microarrays of 553 primary tumors and 143 paired metastatic lymph nodes of NSCLC specimens were stained to detect various putative macrophage phenotypes: M1 (HLA-DR/CD68), M2 (CD163/CD68), M2 (CD204/CD68), and pan-macrophage (CD68/CK). Correlation analyses were performed to examine the relationship between TAMs and adaptive/innate immune infiltrates. HLA-DR+/CD68+M1 TAM level significantly decreased from pathological stage I to III. In a compartment-specific correlation analysis, moderate to strong correlations were observed between both TAM subsets (M1 and M2) with CD3-, CD8-, CD4-, and CD45RO-positive immune cells. Survival analyses, in both stromal and intratumoral compartments, revealed that high levels of HLA-DR+/CD68+M1 (stroma, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73, P = .03; intratumor, HR = 0.7, P = .04), CD204+M2 (stroma, HR = 0.7, P = .02; intratumor, HR = 0.6, P = .004), and CD68 (stroma, HR = 0.69, P = .02; intratumor, HR = 0.73, P = .04) infiltration were independently associated with improved NSCLC-specific survival. In lymph nodes, the intratumoral level of HLA-DR+/CD68+M1 was an independent positive prognostic indicator (Cox model, HR = 0.38, P = .001). In conclusion, high levels of M1, CD204+M2, and CD68 macrophages are independent prognosticators of prolonged survival in NSCLC.",

The genetic landscape of T-ALL has been largely characterized by next-generation sequencing. Yet, the transcriptome of miRNAs (miRNome) of T-ALL has been less extensively studied. Using small RNA sequencing, we characterized the miRNome of 34 pediatric T-ALL samples, including the expression of isomiRs and the identification of candidate novel miRNAs (not previously annotated in miRBase). For the first time, we show that immunophenotypic subtypes of T-ALL present different miRNA expression profiles. To extend miRNome characteristics in T-ALL (to 82\u202fT-ALL cases), we combined our small RNA-seq results with data available in Gene Expression Omnibus. We report on miRNAs most abundantly expressed in pediatric T-ALL and miRNAs differentially expressed in T-ALL versus normal mature T-lymphocytes and thymocytes, representing candidate oncogenic and tumor suppressor miRNAs. Using eight target prediction algorithms and pathway enrichment analysis, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs and their predicted targets implicated in processes (defined in Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) of potential importance in pathogenesis of T-ALL, including interleukin-6\u2013mediated signaling, mTOR signaling, and regulation of apoptosis. We finally focused on hsa-mir-106a-363 cluster and functionally validated direct interactions of hsa-miR-20b-5p and hsa-miR-363-3p with 3\u2032 untranslated regions of their predicted targets (PTEN, SOS1, LATS2), overrepresented in regulation of apoptosis. hsa-mir-106a-363 is a paralogue of prototypic oncogenic hsa-mir-17-92 cluster with yet unestablished role in the pathogenesis of T-ALL.

We further established that the tumor suppressor effect of NFAT1 is mediated by its inactivation of ITGA6 transcription.

We used carcinomatosis fluids (n\u202f=\u202f16) collected from patients diagnosed with epithelial ovarian cancer, detected by an increase in CA125 levels. Our results indicate that HLA-G is expressed by 1) ascitic cell clusters, 2) stromal cells (hospicells) extracted from cancer cell clusters, and 3) cancer cell lines and tumor cells. The origin of HLA-G was linked to inflammatory cytokines present in the cancer microenvironment. In parallel, the ascitic fluid of patients with ovarian cancer contains soluble HLA-G (sHLA-G). The mesothelial cell layer and submesothelial tissues, as well as the immune cell infiltrate, do not secrete HLA-G. In contrast, sHLA-G is absorbed by peritoneal tissues along with mesothelial layers as well as immune cell infiltrates. We demonstrated that interleukin-1\u03b2 along with TGF-\u03b2 can be a major HLA-G\u2013inducing factor that upregulates HLA-G expression through the NF-\u03baB pathway. The level of HLA-G in ascites correlated positively with the expression of T regulatory (T-regs) cells, while it negatively correlated with the expression of natural killer and memory cells in tumor-infiltrating immune cells. In conclusion, the production of HLA-G is associated with the presence of inflammatory cytokines and is strongly correlated with microenvironment tolerant cells such as T-regs and diminution of NK and memory T cells.",

Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) selectively target hypoxic cells and their activity can extend to well-oxygenated areas of tumors via diffusion of active metabolites. This type of bystander effect has been suggested to be responsible for the single agent activity of the clinical-stage HAP evofosfamide (TH-302) but direct evidence is lacking. To dissect the contribution of bystander effects to TH-302 activity, we implemented a Green's function pharmacokinetic (PK) model to simulate the spatial distribution of O2, TH-302 and its cytotoxic metabolites, bromo-isophosphoramide mustard (Br-IPM) and its dichloro derivative isophosphoramide mustard (IPM), in two digitized tumor microvascular networks. The model was parameterized from literature and experimentally, including measurement of diffusion coefficients of TH-302 and its metabolites in multicellular layer cultures. The latter studies demonstrate that Br-IPM and IPM cannot diffuse significantly from the cells in which they are generated, although evidence was obtained for diffusion of the hydroxylamine metabolite of TH-302. The spatially resolved PK model was linked to a pharmacodynamic (PD) model that describes cell killing probability at each point in the tumor microregion as a function of Br-IPM and IPM exposure. The resulting PK/PD model accurately predicted previously reported monotherapy activity of TH-302 in H460 tumors, without invoking a bystander effect, demonstrating that the notable single agent activity of TH-302 in tumors can be accounted for by significant bioreductive activation of TH-302 even in oxic regions, driven by the high plasma concentrations achievable with this well-tolerated prodrug.",

Phagocytic CD68+ cells were found to correlate with Gleason score in human PCa samples, and M2-like macrophages (F4/80+CD206+) were identified in PCa bone resident tumors in mice. Induced M2-like macrophages in vitro were more proficient at phagocytosis (efferocytosis) of apoptotic tumor cells than M1-like macrophages. Moreover, soluble factors released from efferocytic versus nonefferocytic macrophages increased PC-3 prostate cancer cell numbers in vitro. Trabectedin exposure reduced M2-like (F4/80+CD206+) macrophages in vivo. Trabectedin administration after PC-3 cell intracardiac inoculation reduced skeletal metastatic tumor growth. Preventative pretreatment with trabectedin 7 days prior to PC-3 cell injection resulted in reduced M2-like macrophages in the marrow and reduced skeletal tumor size.

Subtype-specific cellular morphology is maintained during short-term culturing, resulting in the formation of holoclonal, meroclonal, and paraclonal colonies. A549 holoclone cells were characterized by an epithelial and stem-like phenotype, paraclone cells featured a mesenchymal phenotype, whereas meroclone cells were phenotypically intermediate. Cell-surface marker expression of subpopulations changed over time, indicating an active epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in vitro and in vivo. EMT has been associated with the overexpression of the immunomodulators PD-L1 and PD-L2, which were 37- and 235-fold overexpressed in para- versus holoclone cells, respectively. We found that DNA methylation is involved in epigenetic regulation of marker expression. Holoclone cells were extremely sensitive to cisplatin and radiotherapy in vitro, whereas paraclone cells were highly resistant. However, inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase AXL, whose expression is associated with an EMT, specifically targeted the otherwise highly resistant paraclone cells. Xenograft tumor formation capacity was 24- and 269-fold higher in holo- than mero- and paraclone cells, respectively.

Furthermore, restoration of miR-503-5p by transfection with mimics or NF-\u03baB inhibitor efficiently blocked CD97 expression and the downstream JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Target inhibition of JAK with siRNA also impaired colony formation and metastasis of LPS-stimulated and paclitaxel-resistant ovarian cancer cells.

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dormancy is one characteristic of cancer cells to make patients remain asymptomatic before metastasis and relapse, which is closely related to the survival rate of cancer patients, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). PRRX1 has previously been implicated in the invasion and metastasis of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in different types of human carcinoma. However, whether PRRX1 can regulate cancer dormancy and its reactivation, leading to the migration and invasion of HNSCC cells, remains elusive. The aim of this study was to determine the role of PRRX1 in cellular phenotype plasticity and cancer dormancy of HNSCC cells and its association with miRNAs in HNSCC. METHODS: The expression of PRRX1 was detected by immunohistochemical staining in primary HNSCC samples and the metastatic lymph nodes. Meanwhile, the role of PRRX1 and its relationship with miR-642b-3p and EMT in cellular phenotype plasticity and cancer dormancy of HNSCC were investigated in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: PRRX1 was significantly higher at the invasive front of HNSCC samples compared with the metastatic lymph nodes, and such switch process was accompanied by the cellular phenotype plasticity and cell dormancy activation. In HNSCC cell lines, PRRX1 positively promoted the expression of known EMT inducers and cooperated with activated TGF-\u03b21 to contribute to EMT and migration and invasion of HNSCC cells. Then, we found that overexpression of miR-642b-3p, one of the most significantly downregulated miRNAs in PRRX1-overexpressed cells, significantly reduced the migration and invasion, and increased cell proliferation and apoptosis. And miR-642b-3p restoration reversed PRRX1-induced cell dormancy and EMT of HNSCC cells through TGF-\u03b22 and p38. Finally, we demonstrated that overexpressed PRRX1 was closely correlated with miR-642b-3p downregulation and the upregulation of TGF-\u03b22 and p38 in a xenograft model of HNSCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed that PRRX1 may be one of the main driving forces for the cellular phenotype plasticity and tumor dormancy of HNSCC. Therefore, we can raise the possibility that EMT may help to keep cancer cell in dormant state and mesenchymal-epithelial transition may resurge dormancy in HNSCC.",

TSC-associated tumors exhibit somatic loss of the second allele of the TSC genes, leading to aberrant activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) causes addiction to glucose and glutamine in Tsc1\u2212/\u2212 or Tsc2\u2212/\u2212 mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Blocking of glutamine anaplerosis in combination with glycolytic inhibition causes significant cell death in Tsc2\u2212/\u2212 but not Tsc2+/+ MEFs.

Following 2 months of treatment of Tsc2+/\u2212 mice from the age of 12\u202fmonths, combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 significantly reduced overall size and cellular areas of all renal lesions (cystic/papillary adenomas and solid carcinomas), but neither alone did. Combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 inhibited mTORC1 and the proliferation of tumor cells but did not increase apoptosis. However, combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 was not as efficacious as rapamycin alone or rapamycin in combination with either 3-BrPA or CB-839 for renal lesions of Tsc2+/\u2212 mice. Consistently, rapamycin alone or rapamycin in combination with either 3-BrPA or CB-839 had stronger inhibitory effects on mTORC1 and proliferation of tumor cells than combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839.

     "abstract": "Metastatic dissemination continues to be a major cause of prostate cancer (PCa) mortality, creating a compelling need to understand factors that play a role in the metastatic cascade. Since hypoxia plays an important role in PCa aggressiveness, we characterized patterns of hypoxia in the primary tumor and metastatic environments of a human PCa xenograft. We previously developed and characterized an imaging strategy based on the hypoxia response element (HRE)\u2013driven expression of long-lived enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and short-lived luciferase (luc) fused to the oxygen-dependent degradation domain in human PCa PC-3 cells. Both reporter proteins were placed under the transcriptional control of a five\u2013tandem repeat HRE sequence. PC-3 cells also constitutively expressed the tdTomato red fluorescent protein, allowing cancer cell detection in vivo. This \u201ctimer\u201d strategy can provide information on the temporal evolution of HIF activity and hypoxia in tumors. Here, for the first time, we performed in vivo and ex vivo imaging of this dual HIF reporter system in PC-3 metastatic tumors implanted orthotopically in the prostate and PC-3 nonmetastatic tumors implanted subcutaneously. We observed distinct patterns of EGFP and luc expression in subcutaneous and orthotopic tumors, and in metastatic nodules, that provide new insights into the presence of hypoxia at primary and metastatic tumor sites, and of the role of hypoxia in metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Bi-allelic inactivation of the VHL gene on chromosome 3p is the characteristic feature in most clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC). Frequent gene alterations were also identified in SETD2, BAP1 and PBRM1, all of which are situated on chromosome 3p and encode histone/chromatin regulators. The relationship between gene mutation, loss of protein expression and the correlations with clinicopathological parameters is important for the understanding of renal cancer progression. We analyzed PBRM1 and BAP1 protein expression as well as the tri-methylation state of H3K36 as a surrogate marker for SETD2 activity in more than 700 RCC samples. In ccRCC loss of nuclear PBRM1 (68%), BAP1 (40%) and H3K36me3 (47%) expression was significantly correlated with each other, advanced tumor stage, poor tumor differentiation (P\u202f<\u202f.0001 each), and necrosis (P\u202f<\u202f.005) Targeted next generation sequencing of 83 ccRCC samples demonstrated a significant association of genetic mutations in PBRM1, BAP1, and SETD2 with absence of PBRM1, BAP1, and HEK36me3 protein expression (P\u202f<\u202f.05, each). By assigning the protein expression patterns to evolutionary subtypes, we revealed similar clinical phenotypes as suggested by TRACERx Renal. Given their important contribution to tumor suppression, we conclude that combined functional inactivation of PBRM1, BAP1, SETD2 and pVHL is critical for ccRCC progression.",

Since the publication of the first NIH white paper on hyperpolarized 13C MRI in 2011, preclinical studies involving [1-13C]pyruvate as well a number of other 13C labeled metabolic substrates have demonstrated this technology's capacity to provide unique metabolic information. A dose-ranging study of HP [1-13C]pyruvate in patients with prostate cancer established safety and feasibility of this technique. Additional studies are ongoing in prostate, brain, breast, liver, cervical, and ovarian cancer. Technology for generating and delivering hyperpolarized agents has evolved, and new MR data acquisition sequences and improved MRI hardware have been developed. It will be important to continue investigation and development of existing and new probes in animal models. Improved polarization technology, efficient radiofrequency coils, and reliable pulse sequences are all important objectives to enable exploration of the technology in healthy control subjects and patient populations. It will be critical to determine how HP 13C MRI might fill existing needs in current clinical research and practice, and complement existing metabolic imaging modalities. Financial sponsorship and integration of academia, industry, and government efforts will be important factors in translating the technology for clinical research in oncology. This white paper is intended to provide recommendations with this goal in mind.",

BT474 tumor-bearing mice (N = 30) were treated with trastuzumab or saline and imaged longitudinally with either dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or 18F-fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) positron emission tomography (PET). At the imaging study end point (day 4 for MRI or 7 for PET), each tumor was excised for immunohistochemistry analysis. Voxel-based histogram analysis was performed on imaging-derived parametric maps (i.e., Ktrans and ve from DCE-MRI, SUV from 18F-FMISO-PET) of the tumor region of interest to measure heterogeneity. Image processing and histogram analysis of whole tumor slice immunohistochemistry data were performed to validate the in vivo imaging findings. Trastuzumab-treated tumors had increased heterogeneity in quantitative imaging measures of cellularity (ve), with a mean Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) distance of 0.32 (P = .05) between baseline and end point distributions. Trastuzumab-treated tumors had increased vascular heterogeneity (Ktrans) and decreased hypoxic heterogeneity (SUV), with a mean K-S distance of 0.42 (P < .01) and 0.46 (P = .047), respectively, between baseline and study end points. These observations were validated by whole-slice immunohistochemistry analysis with mean interquartile range of CD31 distributions of 1.72 for treated and 0.95 for control groups (P = .02). Quantitative longitudinal changes in tumor cellular and vascular heterogeneity in response to therapy may provide evidence for early prediction of response and guide therapy for patients with HER2+ breast cancer.",

The protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) regulatory subunit SDS22 plays a significant role in cell cycle progression. A recent study showed that SDS22 plays a vital role in epithelial integrity and tumor suppression in Drosophila. However, its tumor suppressive activity remains obscure in the mammalian system. Here, for the first time, we show that SDS22 inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells through induction of apoptosis. SDS22 negatively regulates the AKT kinase signaling pathway through PP1. SDS22 associates predominantly with AKT and dephosphorylates the phospho Thr308 and phospho Ser473 through PP1 and hence abrogates the cell migration, invasion, and tumor growth. Thus, our study deciphers the long-standing question of how PP1 negatively regulates the AKT signaling pathway. Further, we observed a significant converse correlation in the expression levels of SDS22 and phospho form of AKT with reduced levels of SDS22 in the higher grades of cancer. Overall, our results suggest that SDS22 could be a putative tumor suppressor and replenishment of SDS22 would be an important strategy to restrict the tumor progression.",

AC0010 selectively inhibits EGFR T790M mutation in both preclinical and clinical studies. However, AC0010 treatment eventually triggers drug resistance with unknown mechanism. To this end, we established two H1975 NSCLC-derived lines resistant to AC0010 after a series of drug exposure and selection in either nude-mice xenograft tumor (H1975-P) or cell culture (H1975-AVR) settings. Both lines obtained 100-fold resistance to AC0010 as compared to the parental lines. To elucidate underlying mechanism, we performed unbiased RNAseq-based profiling analysis and found that H1975-P cells had c-MET overexpression, whereas H1975-AVR cells had BCL-2 overexpression. AC0010 resistance was partially abrogated by targeting c-MET or BCL-2 using either pharmacological (small molecule inhibitors) and/or genetic (siRNA-based knockdown) approach, respectively. Our study shows that drug resistance to AC0010 can be developed via the different mechanism in a cell context\u2013dependent manner and provides the proof-of-concept evidence for rational drug combinations to overcome resistance for maximal therapeutic efficacy.",

However, whether and how PKC\u03b6 regulates tumor cells fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation are unknown. Here, we report that the phosphorylation of SIRT6 is significantly increased after palmitic acid (PA) treatment in colon cancer cells. PKC\u03b6 can physically interact with SIRT6 in vitro and in vivo, and this interaction enhances following PA treatment. Further experiments show that PKC\u03b6 is the phosphorylase of SIRT6 and phosphorylates SIRT6 at threonine 294 residue to promote SIRT6 enrichment on chromatin. In the functional study, we find that the expression of ACSL1, CPT1, CACT, and HADHB, the genes related to fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation, increases after PA stimulation. We further confirm that PKC\u03b6 mediates the binding of SIRT6 specifically to the promoters of fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation\u2013related genes and elicits the expression of these genes through SIRT6 phosphorylation. Our findings demonstrate the mechanism of PKC\u03b6 as a new phosphorylase of SIRT6 on maintaining tumor fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation and define the new role of PKC\u03b6 in lipid homeostasis.",

IFN\u03b3 up-regulates mRNA as well as protein levels of MLKL demonstrating that IFN\u03b3 transcriptionally regulates MLKL. This notion is further supported by Actinomycin D chase experiments showing that IFN\u03b3-stimulated up-regulation of MLKL is prevented in the presence of the transcriptional inhibitor Actinomycin D. Also, knockdown of the transcription factor IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 1 as well as knockout of IRF1 significantly attenuate IFN\u03b3-mediated induction of MLKL mRNA levels.

In this preclinical study of novel CTCL therapy, we performed in vitro and ex vivo experiments to determine the efficacy of combination treatment with a panel of BET bromodomain inhibitors (BETi) (JQ1, OTX015, CPI-0610, I-BET762) and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) (SAHA/Vorinostat, Romidepsin). BETi/HDACi combinations were synergistic (combination index <1) against cell viability and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis was uniformly enhanced. From a mechanistic standpoint, proliferative drivers c-Myc, Cyclin D1, NFkB, and IL-15R\u03b1 were reduced. Inhibitory CDKN1A was increased. CDKN1B, IL-7R, IL-17R\u03b1, STAT3, and STAT5 alterations varied. There were significant increases in extrinsic apoptotic pathway death receptors and ligands (FasL, DR4, DR5, TRAIL, and TNFR1). At clinically tolerable levels of single agents, Romidepsin (1 nM)\u202f+\u202fOTX015 (125 nM) induced the greatest apoptosis (60%_80%) at 96\u202fhours. Ex vivo studies of leukemic CTCL cells obtained from patients with Sezary syndrome also showed higher levels of apoptosis (about 60%-90%) in response to combination treatments relative to single agents. In contrast, combination treatment of normal CD4+ T cells induced only minimal apoptosis (<10%). Our findings show that the mechanism of action of BETi/HDACi therapy in CTCL involves induction of both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis with reduced proliferative drivers and enhanced expression of apoptotic extrinsic pathway death receptors and ligands. Relative to single agents, the superior anti-CTCL effects of BETi/HDACi combinations in vitro and ex vivo provide a rationale for clinical trials exploring their efficacy as therapy for CTCL.",

MMECs showed higher expression of Jagged1/2 ligands, of activated Notch1/2 receptors, and of Hes1/Hey1 Notch target genes than ECs from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients, suggesting that homotypic activation of Notch pathway occurs in MM. MM cells co-cultured with MMECs triggered Notch activation in these cells through a cell-to-cell contact-dependent way via Jagged1/2, resulting in Hes1/Hey1 overexpression. The angiogenic effect of Notch pathway was analyzed through Notch1/2\u00b7siRNAs and the \u03b3-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 by in vitro (adhesion, migration, chemotaxis, angiogenesis) and in vivo (Vk12598/C57B/6 J mouse model) studies. Activated Notch1/2 pathway was associated with the overangiogenic MMEC phenotype: Notch1/2 knockdown or MK-0752 treatment reduced Hes1/Hey1 expression, impairing in vitro angiogenesis of both MMECs alone and co-cultured with MM cells. MM cells were unable to restore angiogenic abilities of treated MMECs, proving that MMEC angiogenic activities closely rely on Notch pathway. Furthermore, Notch1/2 knockdown affected VEGF/VEGFR2 axis, indicating that the Notch pathway interferes with VEGF-mediated control on angiogenesis. MK-0752 reduced secretion of proangiogenic/proinflammatory cytokines in conditioned media, thus inhibiting blood vessel formation in the CAM assay. In the Vk12598/C57B/6 J mouse, MK-0752 treatment restrained angiogenesis by reducing microvessel density. Overall, homotypic and heterotypic Jagged1/2-mediated Notch activation enhances MMECs angiogenesis. Notch axis inhibition blocked angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the Notch pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target in MM.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most aggressive and lethal types of brain tumor. Despite the advancements in conventional or targeted therapies, median survival of GBM patients is less than 12 months. Amongst various signaling pathways aberrantly activated in glioma, active Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway is one of the crucial oncogenic players. \u03b2-catenin, an important mediator of Wnt signaling pathway, gets phosphorylated by GSK3\u03b2 complex. Phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin is specifically recognized by \u03b2-Trcp1, a F-box/WD40-repeat protein and with the help of Skp1 it plays a central role in recruiting phosphorylated \u03b2-catenin for degradation. In GBM, expression of \u03b2-TrCP1 and its affinity for \u03b2 catenin is reported to be very low. Hence, we investigated whether any other members of the E3 ubiquitin ligase family could be involved in degradation of nuclear \u03b2-catenin. We here report that FBXO16, a component of SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, is an interacting protein partner for \u03b2-catenin and mediates its degradation. Next, we show that FBXO16 functions as a tumor suppressor in GBM. Under normal growth conditions, FBXO16 proteasomally degrades \u03b2-catenin in a GSK-3\u03b2 independent manner. Specifically, the C-terminal region of FBXO16 targets the nuclear \u03b2-catenin for degradation and inhibits TCF4/LEF1 dependent Wnt signaling pathway. The nuclear fraction of \u03b2-catenin undergoes K-48 linked poly-ubiquitination in presence of FBXO16. In summary, we show that due to low expression of FBXO16, the \u03b2-catenin is not targeted in glioma cells leading to its nuclear accumulation resulting in active Wnt signaling. Activated Wnt signaling potentiates the glioma cells toward a highly proliferative and malignant state.",

To address this question, a murine model with fibroblast-specific Pten deletion was used to examine how PTEN regulates matrix remodeling. Using second harmonic generation microscopy, Pten deletion was found to promote collagen alignment parallel to the mammary duct in the normal gland and further remodeling perpendicular to the tumor edge in tumor-bearing mice. Increased alignment was observed with Pten deletion in vitro using fibroblast-derived matrices. PTEN loss was associated with fibroblast activation and increased cellular contractility, as determined by traction force microscopy. Inhibition of contractility abrogated the increased matrix alignment observed with PTEN loss. Murine mammary adenocarcinoma cells cultured on aligned matrices derived from Pten\u2212/\u2212 fibroblasts migrated faster than on matrices from wild-type fibroblasts. Combined, these data demonstrate that PTEN loss in fibroblasts promotes extracellular matrix deposition and alignment independently from cancer cell presence, and this reorganization regulates cancer cell behavior. Importantly, stromal PTEN negatively correlated with collagen alignment and high mammographic density in human breast tissue, suggesting parallel function for PTEN in patients.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant promoter methylation plays a vital role in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, its role in treatment responses is unclear, especially for metastatic disease. Here, we investigated the association between promoter methylation and treatment outcomes of irinotecan-based chemotherapy in 102 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Promoter methylation was examined by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for three loci (CHFR, WRN, and SULF2) associated with chemotherapy response and five CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)\u2013specific markers (CACNA1G, IGF2, NEUROG1, RUNX3, and SOCS1). Association between CHFR methylation and in vitro sensitivity to irinotecan was also evaluated. Promoter methylation of CHFR, WRN, and SULF2 was identified in 16 (15.7%), 24 (23.5%), and 33 (32.4%) patients, respectively. CIMP status was positive in 22 (21.6%) patients. CHFR methylation was associated with a significantly longer time to progression (TTP) (median: 8.77 vs. 4.43 months, P = .019), with trends favoring higher overall survival (OS) (median: 22.83 vs. 20.17 months, P = .300) and response rates (31.3% vs. 17.4%, P = .300). For patients with unmethylated CHFR, TTP (median: 5.60 vs. 3.53, P = .020) and OS (median: 20.57 vs. 9.23, P = .006) were significantly different according to CIMP status. Colorectal cancer cell lines with CHFR methylation demonstrated increased sensitivity to irinotecan. Both CHFR overexpression and combination with 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine reversed irinotecan sensitivity in CHFR-methylated cell lines, whereas CHFR knockdown in unmethylated cells restored sensitivity to irinotecan. These data suggest that CHFR methylation may be associated with favorable treatment outcomes of irinotecan-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.",

Fusion-BRAF-expressing neural stem cells (NSCs) exhibit increased cell growth and can generate glioma-like lesions following injection into the cerebella of na\u00efve mice. Increased Iba1+ monocyte (microglia) infiltration is associated with murine f-BRAF-expressing NSC-induced glioma-like lesion formation, suggesting that f-BRAF-expressing NSCs attract microglia to establish a microenvironment supportive of tumorigenesis. Herein, we identify Ccl2 as the chemokine produced by f-BRAF-expressing NSCs, which is critical for creating a permissive stroma for gliomagenesis. In addition, f-BRAF regulation of Ccl2 production operates in an ERK- and NF\u03baB-dependent manner in cerebellar NSCs. Finally, Ccr2-mediated microglia recruitment is required for glioma-like lesion formation in vivo, as tumor do not form in Ccr2-deficient mice following f-BRAF-expressing NSC injection.

     "abstract": "The S100 protein family contains 20 functionally expressed members, which are commonly dysregulated in cancer. Their wide range of functions includes cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of transcription factors, inflammation, chemotaxis, and angiogenesis. S100 proteins have in several types of cancer proven to be biomarkers for disease progression and prognosis. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a highly heterogeneous and aggressive disease in which immature myeloblasts replace normal hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow. This review focuses on the S100 protein family members, which commonly are dysregulated in AML, and on the consequences of their dysregulation in the disorder. Like in other cancers, it appears as if S100 proteins are potential biomarkers for leukemogenesis. Furthermore, several S100 members seem to be involved in maintaining the leukemic phenotype. For these reasons, specific S100 proteins might serve as prognostic biomarkers, especially in the patient subset with intermediate/undetermined risk, and as potential targets for patient-adjusted therapy. Because the question of the most suitable candidate S100 biomarkers in AML still is under discussion, because particular AML subgroups lead to specific S100 signatures, and because downstream effects and the significance of co-expression of potential S100 binding partners in AML are not fully elucidated yet, we conclude that a panel of S100 proteins will probably be best suited for prognostic purposes.",

We found that krasV12 promotes intestinal carcinogenesis by generating a transgenic zebrafish line with inducible krasV12 expression in the intestine, Tg(ifabp:EGFP-krasV12). The transgenic fish generated exhibited significant increases in the rates of intestinal epithelial outgrowth, proliferation, and cross talk in the active Ras signaling pathway involving in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). These results provide in vivo evidence of Ras pathway activation via krasV12 overexpression. Long-term transgenic expression of krasV12 resulted in enteritis, epithelial hyperplasia, and tubular adenoma in adult fish. This was accompanied by increased levels of the signaling proteins p-Erk and p-Akt and by downregulation of the EMT marker E-cadherin. Furthermore, we also observed a synergistic effect of krasV12 expression and dextran sodium sulfate treatment to enhance intestinal tumor in zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that krasV12 overexpression induces intestinal tumorigenesis in zebrafish, which mimics intestinal tumor formation in humans. Thus, our transgenic zebrafish may provide a valuable in vivo platform that can be used to investigate tumor initiation and anticancer drugs for gastrointestinal cancers.",

In cutaneous melanoma, an extremely aggressive and highly metastatic disease, RICTOR overexpression is involved in tumor development and invasiveness. Therefore, we investigated the impact of RICTOR inhibition in melanoma cells in vitro and in vivo with special emphasis on hepatic metastasis. Moreover, our study focused on the interaction of tumor cells and hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which play a crucial role in the hepatic microenvironment. In silico analysis revealed increased RICTOR expression in melanoma cells and tissues and indicated higher expression in advanced melanoma stages and metastases. In vitro, transient RICTOR knock-down via siRNA caused a significant reduction of tumor cell motility. Using a syngeneic murine splenic injection model, a significant decrease in liver metastasis burden was detected in vivo. Moreover, stimulation of melanoma cells with conditioned medium (CM) from activated HSC or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) led to a significant induction of AKT phosphorylation and tumor cell motility. Blocking of RICTOR expression in cancer cells diminished constitutive and HGF-induced AKT phosphorylation as well as cell motility. Interestingly, RICTOR blockade also led to an abrogation of CM-induced effects on AKT phosphorylation and motility in melanoma cells. In conclusion, these results provide first evidence for a critical role of mTORC2/RICTOR in melanoma liver metastasis via cancer cell/HSC interactions.",

To assess the impact of DEK expression levels on cell growth, small interfering RNA and short hairpin RNA approaches were utilized. Decreasing DEK expression in ovarian cancer cell lines slows cell growth and induces apoptosis and DNA damage. The biologic effects of DEK depletion are enhanced with concurrent chemotherapy treatment. The in vitro effects of DEK knockdown are reproduced in vivo, as DEK depletion in a mouse xenograft model results in slower tumor growth and smaller tumors compared to tumors expressing DEK. These findings provide a compelling rationale to target the DEK oncoprotein and its pathways as a therapeutic strategy for treating epithelial ovarian cancer.",

We prospectively evaluated the MEBGEN RASKET-B KIT (RASKET-B), a novel multiplex kit, simultaneously detecting 48 types of RAS mutations and the BRAF V600E mutation using Luminex xMAP technology. The aim was to obtain market approval for RASKET-B as an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) option in Japan. Genomic DNA was extracted from 302 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues obtained from CRC patients. The primary endpoints were the concordance rate (CR) between the results from RASKET-B and the previously approved IVD kit (RASKET) for RAS mutations, and CR between the results from RASKET-B and direct sequencing (DS) for BRAF mutations. The secondary endpoints included the CR between RASKET-B and DS for RAS mutations and between RASKET-B and the pyrosequencing (PYRO) for the BRAF V600E mutation. Among the 302 samples, 142 RAS mutations (47%) and 18 BRAF V600E mutations (6.0%) were detected by RASKET-B. All mutations detected in the recruited patients were mutually exclusive. Both RAS and BRAF mutation rates were statistically higher in right-sided than left-sided CRC. The CR between RASKET-B and RASKET for RAS gene and RASKET-B and DS for BRAF V600E mutation was 100% for both (95% CI: 99%-100%). The results from RASKET-B were also highly concordant with DS for RAS (97.4%) and with PYRO for the BRAF (V600E) gene (99.7%). RASKET-B thus provides rapid, precise, and simultaneous detection of RAS and BRAF mutations in CRC.",

MCC reveals a trilinear differentiation characterized by neuroendocrine, epithelial and pre/pro B-cell lymphocytic gene expression disguising the cellular origin of MCC. Here we investigated the expression of the neuroendocrine key regulators RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), neurogenic differentiation 1 (NeuroD1) and the Achaete-scute homolog 1 (ASCL1) in MCC. All MCCs were devoid of REST and were positive for NeuroD1 expression. Only one MCC tissue revealed focal ASCL1 expression. This was confirmed in MCPyV-positive MCC cell lines. Of interest, MCPyV-negative cell lines did express REST. The introduction of REST expression in REST-negative, MCPyV-positive MCC cells downregulated the neuroendocrine gene expression. The lack of the neuroendocrine master regulator ASCL1 in almost all tested MCCs points to an important role of the absence of the negative regulator REST towards the MCC neuroendocrine phenotype. This is underlined by the expression of the REST-regulated microRNAs miR-9/9* in REST-negative MCC cell lines. These data might provide the basis for the understanding of neuroendocrine gene expression profile which is expected to help to elucidate the cellular origin of MCC.",

F10 is much more cytotoxic than 5-FU to colorectal cancer (CRC) cells; however, the mechanism of enhanced F10 cytotoxicity remains incompletely characterized. Using DNA fiber analysis, we establish that F10 decreases replication fork velocity and causes replication fork collapse, while 1000-fold excess of 5-FU is required to achieve similar endpoints. Treatment of HCT-116 cells with F10 results in Chk1 phosphorylation and activation of intra\u2013S-phase checkpoint. Combining F10 with pharmacological inhibition of Chk1 with either PF-477736 or prexasertib in CRC cells enhanced DNA damage relative to single-agent treatment as assessed by \u03b3H2AX intensity and COMET assay. PF-477736 or prexasertib co-treatment also inhibited upregulation of Rad51 levels in response to F10, resulting in reduced homologous repair. siRNA knockdown of Chk1 also increased F10-induced DNA damage assessed and sensitized CRC cells to F10. However, Chk1 knockdown did not inhibit Rad51 upregulation by F10, indicating that the scaffolding activity of Chk1 imparts activity in DNA repair distinct from Chk1 enzymatic activity. Our results indicate that F10 is cytotoxic to CRC cells in part through DNA damage subsequent to replication fork collapse. F10 is ~1000-fold more potent than 5-FU at inducing replication-mediated DNA damage which correlates with the increased overall potency of F10 relative to 5-FU. F10 efficacy can be enhanced by pharmacological inhibition of Chk1.",

Since c-Abl plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, we asked whether SOCS3 is regulated by c-Abl\u2013dependent phosphorylation. Here, we found that SOCS3 interacted with all three Abl kinases (Bcr-Abl, v-Abl, and c-Abl), and SH1 domain of the Abl kinases was critically required for such interaction. Furthermore, the SH2 domain of SOCS3 was sufficient to pull down the SH1 domain but not the full length of Bcr-Abl. Importantly, SOCS3 was highly tyrosine phosphorylated by c-Abl, leading to impairment of its ability to suppress JAK2 activity. In addition, disrupting the tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 promoted apoptosis of c-Abl\u2013expressing cells and impeded xenograft growth of these tumor cells in nude mice. The results demonstrate that SOCS3 is highly tyrosine phosphorylated by c-Abl and that tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS3 is required for the survival and tumorigenesis of certain cells.

Gene expression profiling analysis revealed aberrant expression of several cell-cycle and apoptosis-related genes, and the DNA methylation assay identified both hypo- and hypermethylation features in different regions throughout the whole genome of DNMT3A mutants-transduced myeloid cells.

Our meta-analysis of normal, benign, and malignant thyroid samples demonstrated that ETV5 expression is upregulated in papillary thyroid cancer and was predominantly associated with BRAF V600E or RAS mutations. However, the precise role of ETV5 in these lesions is unknown. In this study, we used the KTC1 cell line as a model for human advanced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) because the cells harbor the heterozygous BRAF (V600E) mutation together with the C250T TERT promoter mutation. The role of ETV5 in PTC proliferation was tested using RNAi followed by high-throughput screening. Signaling pathways driving ETV5 expression were identified using specific pharmacological inhibitors. To determine if ETV5 influences the expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) markers in these cells, an EMT PCR array was used, and data were confirmed by qPCR and ChIP-qPCR. We found that ETV5 is critical for PTC cell growth, is expressed downstream of the MAPK pathway, and directly upregulates the transcription factor TWIST1, a known marker of intravasation and metastasis. Increased ETV5 expression could therefore be considered as a marker for advanced PTCs and a possible future therapeutic target.",

Its chemical inhibition eliminates subsets of cancer cells in various tumor types. This effect is caused at least partly by the synthetically lethal relationship between ATR and certain DNA repair genes. In a previous screen using an siRNA library against DNA repair genes, we identified PRIM1, a part of the polymerase \u03b1-primase complex, as acting synthetically lethal with ATR. Applying a genetic ATR knock-in model of colorectal cancer cells, we confirmed that PRIM1 depletion inhibited proliferation of ATR-deficient cells and excluded artifacts due to clonal variation using an ATR reexpressing cell clone. We expanded these data by demonstrating in different cell lines that also chemical inhibition of ATR or its main effector kinase CHK1 reduces proliferation upon depletion of PRIM1. Mechanistically, PRIM1 depletion in ATR-deficient cells caused S-phase stasis in the absence of increased DNA damage followed by Wee1-mediated activation of caspase 8 and apoptosis. As PRIM1 inactivation sensitizes cancer cells to ATR and CHK1 inhibitors, mutations in PRIM1 or other components of the polymerase \u03b1-primase complex could represent novel targets for individualized tumor therapeutic approaches using ATR/CHK1 inhibitors, as has been previously demonstrated for POLD1, the catalytic subunit of polymerase \u03b4.",

In the present study, OX40 expression on ALL cells was significantly associated with positivity for the adverse risk factor BCR-ABL. In line, signaling via OX40 increased metabolic activity of primary ALL cells and resulted in release of cytokines involved in disease pathophysiology. Furthermore, interaction of ALL-expressed OX40 with its cognate ligand on NK cells stimulated ALL cell lysis. The data presented thus not only identify the yet unknown involvement of OX40/OX40L in ALL pathophysiology and NK cell immunosurveillance but also point to the necessity to thoroughly consider the consequences of modulating the OX40/OX40L molecule system beyond its effects on T cells when developing OX40-targeting approaches for cancer immunotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Obese women diagnosed with breast cancer have an increased risk for metastasis, and the underlying mechanisms are not well established. Within the mammary gland, adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) are heterogeneous cells with the capacity to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages. To study the effects of obesity on ASCs, mice were fed a control diet (CD) or high-fat diet (HFD) to induce obesity, and ASCs were isolated from the mammary glands of lean and obese mice. We observed that obesity increased ASCs proliferation, decreased differentiation potential, and upregulated expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, a marker of activated fibroblasts, compared to ASCs from lean mice. To determine how ASCs from obese mice impacted tumor growth, we mixed ASCs isolated from CD- or HFD-fed mice with mammary tumor cells and injected them into the mammary glands of lean mice. Tumor cells mixed with ASCs from obese mice grew significantly larger tumors and had increased invasion into surrounding adipose tissue than tumor cells mixed with control ASCs. ASCs from obese mice demonstrated enhanced tumor cell invasion in culture, a phenotype associated with increased expression of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and abrogated by IGF-1 neutralizing antibodies. Weight loss induced in obese mice significantly decreased expression of IGF-1 from ASCs and reduced the ability of the ASCs to induce an invasive phenotype. Together, these results suggest that obesity enhances local invasion of breast cancer cells through increased expression of IGF-1 by mammary ASCs, and weight loss may reverse this tumor-promoting phenotype.",

Preclinical and early-phase clinical studies of BRD4 and AURKA inhibitors, however, show limited efficacy against neuroblastoma when used alone. We report our studies on the concomitant use of the BRD4 inhibitor I-BET151 and AURKA inhibitor alisertib. We show that, in vitro, the drugs act synergistically to inhibit viability in four models of high-risk neuroblastoma. We demonstrate that this synergy is driven, in part, by the ability of I-BET151 to mitigate reflexive upregulation of AURKA, MYC, and MYCN in response to AURKA inhibition. We then demonstrate that I-BET151 and alisertib are effective in prolonging survival in four xenograft neuroblastoma models in vivo, and this efficacy is augmented by the addition of the antitubule chemotherapeutic vincristine. These data suggest that epigenetic and posttranslational inhibition of MYC/MYCN-driven pathways may have significant clinical efficacy against neuroblastoma.",

Using micro-computed tomography to monitor and study parenchymal and extra-parenchymal metastases in existing murine models of lung cancer is challenging owing to a lack of radiographic contrast and difficulty in achieving respiratory gating. To facilitate the analysis of these in vivo imaging studies and study of tumor progression in murine models we developed a novel, rapid, semi-automated method of calculating thoracic tumor burden from computed tomography images. This method, in which commercially available software is used to calculate the mass of the thoracic cavity (MTC), takes into account the aggregate tumor burden in the thoracic cavity. The present study showed that in tumor-free mice, the MTC does not change over time and is not affected by breathing, whereas in tumor-bearing mice, the increase in the MTC is a measure of tumor mass that correlates well with tumor burden measured by lung weight. Tumor burden calculated with our MTC method correlated with that measured by lung weight as well as or better than that calculated using four established methods. To test this method, we assessed metastatic tumor development and response to a pharmacologic PLK1 inhibitor in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model. PLK1 inhibition significantly inhibited tumor growth. Our results demonstrate that the MTC method can be used to study dynamic changes in tumor growth and response to therapeutics in genetically engineered mouse models and orthotopic xenograft mouse models of lung cancer.",

DDK has diverse and apparently conflicting roles in the replication checkpoint response in various organisms, but the underlying mechanisms are far from settled. We show that human DDK promotes limited resection of newly synthesized DNA at stalled replication forks or sites of DNA damage to initiate replication checkpoint signaling. DDK is also required for efficient fork restart and G2/M cell cycle arrest. DDK exhibits genetic interactions with the ssDNA exonuclease EXO1 and phosphorylates EXO1 in vitro. EXO1 is also required for nascent strand degradation following exposure to HU, so DDK might regulate EXO1 directly. Lastly, sublethal DDK inhibition causes various mitotic abnormalities, which is consistent with a checkpoint deficiency. In summary, DDK has a primary and previously undescribed role in the replication checkpoint to promote ssDNA accumulation at stalled forks, which is required to initiate a robust checkpoint response and cell cycle arrest to maintain genome integrity.",

The GSEA analysis showed that the higher level of FOXF1 was positively associated with an enrichment of EMT gene signatures, and exogenous overexpression of FOXF1 induced EMT by transcriptionally activating SNAI1. Exogenous overexpression FOXF1 functionally promoted invasion and metastasis features of CRC cells, and inhibition of SNAI1 attenuates the invasive phenotype and metastatic potential of FOXF1-overexpressing CRC cells.

Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that AXL mediates cell invasion through the regulation of lysosomes peripheral distribution and cathepsin B secretion in EAC cell lines. Furthermore, we show that AXL-dependent peripheral distribution of lysosomes and cell invasion are mediated by extracellular acidification, which is potentiated by AXL-induced secretion of lactate through AKT-NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent MCT-1 regulation.

Nuclear factor I (NFI) is a family of transcription factors that controls glial cell differentiation in the developing central nervous system. NFIs have previously been shown to regulate the expression of astrocyte markers such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in both normal brain and GBM cells. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)\u2013on-chip to identify additional NFI targets in GBM cells. Analysis of our ChIP data revealed ~400 putative NFI target genes including an effector of the Notch signaling pathway, HEY1, implicated in the maintenance of neural stem cells. All four NFIs (NFIA, NFIB, NFIC, and NFIX) bind to NFI recognition sites located within 1\u202fkb upstream of the HEY1 transcription site. We further showed that NFI negatively regulates HEY1 expression, with knockdown of all four NFIs in GBM cells resulting in increased HEY1 RNA levels. HEY1 knockdown in GBM cells decreased cell proliferation, increased cell migration, and decreased neurosphere formation. Finally, we found a general correlation between elevated levels of HEY1 and expression of the brain neural stem/progenitor cell marker B-FABP in GBM cell lines. Knockdown of HEY1 resulted in an increase in the RNA levels of the GFAP astrocyte differentiation marker. Overall, our data indicate that HEY1 is negatively regulated by NFI family members and is associated with increased proliferation, decreased migration, and increased stem cell properties in GBM cells.",

We previously reported critical roles of polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 6 (GALNT6 or GalNAc-T6) that was upregulated in a great majority of breast cancer tissues. Here we further report O-glycosylation of estrogen receptor alpha (ER-\u03b1) by GALNT6 and the significant role of its nuclear localization in breast cancer cells. Knockdown of GALNT6 expression in two breast cancer cell lines, T47D and MCF7, in which both ER-\u03b1 and GALNT6 were highly expressed, by small interfering RNA could significantly attenuate expression of ER-\u03b1. Immunocytochemical analysis clearly demonstrated the drastic decrease of ER-\u03b1 protein in the nucleus of these cancer cells. Accordingly, the downstream genes of the ER-\u03b1 pathway such as MYC, CCND1, and CTSD were significantly downregulated. We confirmed GALNT6-dependent ER-\u03b1 O-glycosylation and identified O-glycosylation of S573 in an F domain of ER-\u03b1 by GALNT6 through LC-MS/MS analysis. We also obtained evidences showing that the glycosylation of ER-\u03b1 at S573 by GALNT6 is essential for protein stability and nuclear localization of ER-\u03b1 in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we designed cell membrane\u2013permeable peptides including the O-glycosylation site and found a significant decrease of the cell viability of breast cancer cells by treatment of these peptides in a GALNT6 expression\u2013dependent manner.

The highly aggressive invasion of malignant cells into the normal brain parenchyma renders complete surgical resection of GBM tumors impossible, increases resistance to therapeutic treatment, and leads to near-universal tumor recurrence. We have previously demonstrated that TROY (TNFRSF19) plays an important role in glioblastoma cell invasion and therapeutic resistance. However, the potential downstream effectors of TROY signaling have not been fully characterized. Here, we identified PDZ-RhoGEF as a binding partner for TROY that potentiated TROY-induced nuclear factor kappa B activation which is necessary for both cell invasion and survival. In addition, PDZ-RhoGEF also interacts with Pyk2, indicating that PDZ-RhoGEF is a component of a signalsome that includes TROY and Pyk2. PDZ-RhoGEF is overexpressed in glioblastoma tumors and stimulates glioma cell invasion via Rho activation. Increased PDZ-RhoGEF expression enhanced TROY-induced glioma cell migration. Conversely, silencing PDZ-RhoGEF expression inhibited TROY-induced glioma cell migration, increased sensitivity to temozolomide treatment, and extended survival of orthotopic xenograft mice. Furthermore, depletion of RhoC or RhoA inhibited TROY- and PDZ-RhoGEF\u2013induced cell migration. Mechanistically, increased TROY expression stimulated Rho activation, and depletion of PDZ-RhoGEF expression reduced this activation. Taken together, these data suggest that PDZ-RhoGEF plays an important role in TROY signaling and provides insights into a potential node of vulnerability to limit GBM cell invasion and decrease therapeutic resistance.",

We analyzed 22 cases of PCNSL using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to detect 64 candidate genes. We used immunohistochemical methods to analyze gene expression in 57 PCNSL samples. NGS showed that recurrent mutations in KMT2D and CD79B, components of the NF-\u03baB pathway, accounted for 65% of total mutations in PCNSL samples. The most frequent mutated gene was PIM1 (77.27%, 17/22), followed by MYD88 (63.64%, 14/22), CD79B (69.09%, 13/22), and KMT2D (50.00%, 11/22). Mutations of the CD79B gene were associated with an inferior progression-free survival (PFS), and GNA13 gene mutations were associated with a shorter PFS and overall survival (OS) in PCNSL patients (P\u202f<\u202f.05). PIM1 and MYD88 were highly expressed in PCNSL patients and were related to their OS time. MYD88 overexpression might be an independent and poor prognostic predictor of OS time. In summary, we identified highly recurrent genetic lesions in CD79B and KMT2D, components of the NF-\u03baB pathway, in PCNSL and validated the expression of PIM1 and MYD88 related to poor survival, thereby providing novel insights into the pathogenesis and precision medicine of PCNSL.",

We identified highly upregulated interleukin 8 (IL-8)-CXCR2 axis in tumor cells in high-grade human glioma and AAT-treated orthotopic GBM tumors. METHODS: Human GBM tissue sections and tissue array were used to ascertain the clinical relevance of CXCR2-positive tumor cells in the formation of VM. We utilized U251 and U87 human tumor cells to understand VM in an orthotopic GBM model and AAT-mediated enhancement in VM was modeled using vatalanib (anti-VEGFR2) and avastin (anti-VEGF). Later, VM was inhibited by SB225002 (CXCR2 inhibitor) in a preclinical study. RESULTS: Overexpression of IL8 and CXCR2 in human datasets and histological analysis was identified as a bonafide candidate to validate VM through in vitro and animal model studies. AAT-treated tumors displayed a higher number of CXCR2-positive GBM-stem cells with endothelial-like phenotypes. Stable knockdown of CXCR2 expression in tumor cells led to decreased tumor growth as well as incomplete VM structures in the animal models. Similar data were obtained following SB225002 treatment. CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggests that tumor cell autonomous IL-8-CXCR2 pathway is instrumental in AAT-mediated resistance and VM formation in GBM. Therefore, CXCR2 can be targeted through SB225002 and can be combined with standard therapies to improve the therapeutic outcomes in clinical trials.",

Knockout of claudin-1 induced apoptosis and significantly inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of cervical adenocarcinoma cells and tumorigenicity in vivo. Importantly, all of the cervical adenocarcinoma cell lines examined expressed a membrane-bound type estrogen receptor, G protein\u2013coupled receptor 30 (GPR30/GPER1), but not ER\u03b1. Estrogen-dependent induction of claudin-1 expression was mediated by GPR30 via ERK and/or Akt signaling. In surgical specimens, there was a positive correlation between claudin-1 expression and GPR30 expression. Double high expression of claudin-1 and GPR30 predicts poor prognosis in patients with cervical adenocarcinomas. Mechanism-based targeting of estrogen/GPR30 signaling and claudin-1 may be effective for cervical adenocarcinoma therapy.",

In this study we sought to address mutational intratumor heterogeneity (ITH) in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). ATL is a malignancy with an incompletely understood molecular pathogenesis caused by infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1). To determine the clonal structure through tumor genetic diversity profiles, we investigated 142 whole-exome sequencing data of tumor and matched normal samples from 71 ATL patients. Based on SciClone analysis, the ATL samples showed a wide spectrum of modes over clonal/subclonal frequencies ranging from one to nine clusters. The average number of clusters was six across samples, but the number of clusters differed among different samples. Of these ATL samples, 94% had more than two clusters. Aggressive ATL cases had slightly more clonal clusters than indolent types, indicating the presence of ITH during earlier stages of disease. The known significantly mutated genes in ATL were frequently clustered together and possibly coexisted in the same clone. IRF4, CCR4, TP53, and PLCG1 mutations were almost clustered in subclones with a moderate variant allele frequency (VAF), whereas HLA-B, CARD11, and NOTCH1 mutations were clustered in subclones with lower VAFs. Taken together, these results show that ATL displays a high degree of ITH and a complex subclonal structure. Our findings suggest that clonal/subclonal architecture might be a useful measure for prognostic purposes and personalized assessment of the therapeutic response.",

Many of these identified genetic and epigenetic changes play a role in the progression of this disease. Studies have identified molecular subtypes in muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) with different sensitivities to frontline therapy suggesting the heterogeneity in these tumors and the importance of molecular characterization of MIBC to provide effective treatment. Specifically, it has become increasingly evident, as demonstrated by The Cancer Genome Atlas project, that metabolic enzymes are commonly dysregulated in BLCA. Elevated expression of multiple metabolic enzymes is due to the increased demand from rapidly proliferating BLCA cells requiring extensive nucleotide synthesis. Cancer cells utilize the de novo purine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway as a source of their nucleotide needs. In this study, we show that phosphoribosyl aminoimidazole succinocarboxamide synthetase (PAICS), an enzyme involved in de novo purine biosynthetic pathway, is significantly overexpressed in BLCA. Immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded tissue sections showed that PAICS is overexpressed in MIBC. Furthermore, we found that tumor suppressor miR-128 negatively regulated PAICS expression by binding to its 3\u2032-untranslated region. We also found that PAICS induces EMT by positively regulating SNAI1 and by a reduction in E-cadherin expression. Additionally, our in vitro functional studies and in vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay show that PAICS plays a critical role in BLCA cell proliferation, invasion, and tumor growth.

     "abstract": "About 15% of human cancers counteract telomere loss by alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT), which is attributed to homologous recombination (HR)\u2013mediated events. But how telomeric HR leads to length elongation is poorly understood. Here, we explore telomere clustering and telomeric HR induced by double-stranded breaks (DSBs). We show that telomere clustering could occur at G1 and S phase of cell cycle and that three types of telomeric HR occur based on the manner of telomeric DNA exchange: equivalent telomeric sister chromatin exchange (T-SCE), inequivalent T-SCE, and No-SCE. While inequivalent T-SCE increases telomere length heterogeneity with no net gain of telomere length, No-SCE, which is presumably induced by interchromatid HR and/or break-induced replication, results in telomere elongation. Accordingly, cells subjected to long-term telomeric DSBs display increased heterogeneity of length and longer telomeres. We also demonstrate that DSBs-induced telomere elongation is telomerase independent. Moreover, telomeric recombination induced by DSBs is associated with formation of ALT-associated PML body and C-circle. Thus, DNA damage triggers recombination mediated elongation, leading to the induction of multiple ALT phenotypes.",

     "abstract": "Current treatment strategies provide minimal results for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Attempts to target the androgen receptor have shown promise, but resistance ultimately develops, often due to androgen receptor reactivation. Understanding mechanisms of resistance, including androgen receptor reactivation, is crucial for development of more efficacious CRPC therapies. Here, we report that the RON receptor tyrosine kinase is highly expressed in the majority of human hormone-refractory prostate cancers. Further, we show that exogenous expression of RON in human and murine prostate cancer cells circumvents sensitivity to androgen deprivation and promotes prostate cancer cell growth in both in vivo and in vitro settings. Conversely, RON loss induces sensitivity of CRPC cells to androgen deprivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that RON overexpression leads to activation of multiple oncogenic transcription factors (namely, \u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB), which are sufficient to drive androgen receptor nuclear localization and activation of AR responsive genes under conditions of androgen deprivation and support castration-resistant growth. In total, this study demonstrates the functional significance of RON during prostate cancer progression and provides a strong rationale for targeting RON signaling in prostate cancer as a means to limit resistance to androgen deprivation therapy.",

     "abstract": "We have previously demonstrated that apigenin promotes the expression of antiangiogenic protein thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) via a mechanism driven by mRNA-binding protein HuR. Here, we generated a novel mouse model with whole-body THBS-1 gene knockout on SKH-1 genetic background, which allows studies of UVB-induced acute skin damage and carcinogenesis and tests TSP1 involvement in apigenin's anticancer effects. Apigenin significantly inhibited UVB-induced carcinogenesis in the wild-type (WT) animals but not in TSP1 KO (TKO) mice, suggesting that TSP1 is a critical component of apigenin's chemopreventive function in UVB-induced skin cancer. Importantly, TKO mice presented with the elevated cutaneous inflammation at baseline, which was manifested by increased inflammatory infiltrates (neutrophils and macrophages) and elevated levels of the two key inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and IL-12. In agreement, maintaining normal TSP1 expression in the UVB-irradiated skin of WT mice using topical apigenin application caused a marked decrease of circulating inflammatory cytokines. Finally, TKO mice showed an altered population dynamics of the bone marrow myeloid progenitor cells (CD11b+), with dramatic expansion of the population of neutrophil progenitors (Ly6ClowLy6Ghigh) compared to the WT control. Our results indicate that the cutaneous tumor suppressor TSP1 is a critical mediator of the in vivo anticancer effect of apigenin in skin, specifically of its anti-inflammatory action.",

The underlying cause(s) accounting for I-CRCs remain poorly understood, but may involve aberrant biology that drives genome instability. Genetic defects inducing genome instability are pathogenic events that lead to the development and progression of traditional sporadic (Sp-) CRCs. Classically, there are two genome instability pathways that give rise to virtually all Sp-CRCs, chromosome instability (CIN; ~85% of Sp-CRCs) and microsatellite instability (MSI; ~15% of Sp-CRCs); however, the contribution MSI and CIN have in I-CRCs is only beginning to emerge. To date, no study has simultaneously evaluated both MSI and CIN within an I-CRC cohort, and thus we sought to determine and compare the prevalence of MSI and/or CIN within population-based I-CRC and matched Sp-CRC cohorts. MSI status was established using a clinically validated, immunohistochemical approach that assessed the presence or absence of four proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2) implicated in MSI. By combining the MSI results of the current study with those of our previous CIN study, we provide unprecedented insight into the prevalence of MSI and/or CIN between and within Sp- and I-CRCs. Our data show that MSI+ tumors are 1.5-times more prevalent within I-CRCs than Sp-CRCs in a population-based setting and further show that CIN+/MSI+ I-CRCs occur at similar frequency as CIN+/MSI+ Sp-CRCs.",

     "abstract": "Diagnosis of breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) presents a challenge since we cannot yet distinguish those cases that would remain indolent and not require aggressive treatment from cases that may progress to invasive ductal cancer (IDC). The purpose of this study is to determine the role of Rap1Gap, a GTPase activating protein, in the progression from DCIS to IDC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of samples from breast cancer patients shows an increase in Rap1Gap expression in DCIS compared to normal breast tissue and IDCs. In order to study the mechanisms of malignant progression, we employed an in vitro three-dimensional (3D) model that more accurately recapitulates both structural and functional cues of breast tissue. Immunoblotting results show that Rap1Gap levels in MCF10.Ca1D cells (a model of invasive carcinoma) are reduced compared to those in MCF10.DCIS (a model of DCIS). Retroviral silencing of Rap1Gap in MCF10.DCIS cells activated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), induced extensive cytoskeletal reorganization and acquisition of mesenchymal phenotype, and enhanced invasion. Enforced reexpression of Rap1Gap in MCF10.DCIS-Rap1GapshRNA cells reduced Rap1 activity and reversed the mesenchymal phenotype. Similarly, introduction of dominant negative Rap1A mutant (Rap1A-N17) in DCIS-Rap1Gap shRNA cells caused a reversion to nonmalignant phenotype. Conversely, expression of constitutively active Rap1A mutant (Rap1A-V12) in noninvasive MCF10.DCIS cells led to phenotypic changes that were reminiscent of Rap1Gap knockdown. Thus, reduction of Rap1Gap in DCIS is a potential switch for progression to an invasive phenotype. The Graphical Abstract summarizes these findings.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: To evaluate the management and outcomes of na\u00efve bilateral retinoblastoma treated at a single-center over a 5-year period during the era of ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) and intravitreous chemotherapy. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of 46 patients (92 eyes) with na\u00efve bilateral retinoblastoma treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center between January 2012 and February 2017. Indirect ophthalmoscopy, fundus photography, ultrasonography, and ultrasonic biomicroscopy were used to evaluate clinical response. Patient, ocular, ocular progression-free, ocular recurrent event\u2013free, and second ocular survivals were assessed by Kaplan-Meier estimates. Retinal toxicity was evaluated by electroretinography. Snellen visual acuity and complete blood count metrics were recorded. RESULTS: Sixty-four eyes (70%) in 41 patients (89%) received ophthalmic artery chemosurgery as part of their treatment. Twenty-six patients (56%) received tandem OAC (bilateral simultaneous infusions). Seven eyes were primarily enucleated. No eye receiving initial OAC was enucleated. There was a single secondary enucleation in an eye initially treated with focal therapy with anterior chamber recurrence. The 3-year Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall ocular, secondary ocular (survival after treatment for recurrence), progression-free, and recurrent event\u2013free survival were 91.3% [95% confidence interval (CI) 83.4-95.5], 98.7% (95% CI 91.3-99.8), 91.5% (95% CI 83.0-95.8), and 78.9% (95% CI 68.2-86.3), respectively. Overall and secondary ocular survivals were 100% for International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) groups A-C. Overall ocular survival was 91.5% (95% CI 70-97.8) for ICRB group D and 71.4% (95% CI 47.1-79.4) for group E. Secondary ocular survival was 95.4% (95% CI 71.8-99.3) for ICRB group D and 100% for group E. There were no treatment-related deaths, three patients developed trilateral retinoblastoma (one died), and one patient (who did not receive OAC) developed metastatic disease and is in remission at 32-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The majority (89%) of bilateral retinoblastoma patients in the current era and at this center were treated with OAC. This has resulted in saving a historic number of eyes. A quarter of eyes developed recurrent disease (defined as recurrent disease requiring any treatment including focal), the majority of which occurred in the first year after treatment, and all but one was saved. There has been no compromise in patient survival.",

Currently, the molecular mechanisms that cause SGT pathogenesis remain poorly understood. A lack of animal models that faithfully recapitulate the naturally occurring process of human SGTs has hampered research progress on this field. In this report, we developed an inducible keratin 5-driven conditional knockout mouse model to delete gene(s) of interest in murine salivary gland upon local RU486 delivery. We have deleted two major tumor suppressors, Pten, a negative regulator of the PI3K pathway, and Smad4, the central signaling mediator of TGF\u03b2 pathway, in the murine salivary gland. Our results have shown that deletion of either Pten or Smad4 in murine salivary gland resulted in pleomorphic adenomas, the most common tumor in human SGT patients. Deletion of both Pten and Smad4 in murine salivary gland developed several malignancies, with salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC) being the most frequently seen. Molecular characterization showed that SACC exhibited mTOR activation and TGF\u03b21 overexpression. Examination of human SGT clinical samples revealed that loss of Pten and Smad4 is common in human SACC samples, particularly in the most aggressive solid form, and is correlated with survival of SACC patients, highlighting the human relevance of the murine models. In summary, our results offer significant insight into synergistic role of Pten and Smad4 in SGT, providing a rationale for targeting mTOR and/or TGF\u03b2 signaling to control SGT formation and progression.",

     "abstract": "Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a major event during cancer progression and metastasis; however, the definitive role of EMT in remodeling tumor microenvironments (TMEs) is unclear. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are a major type of host immune cells in TMEs, and they perform a wide range of functions to regulate tumor colonization and progression by regulating tumor invasiveness, local tumor immunity, and angiogenesis. TAMs are considered to have an M2-like, i.e., alternatively activated, phenotype; however, how these EMT-undergoing cancer cells promote M2 polarization of TAMs as a crucial tumor-host interplay during cancer progression is unclear. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of EMT-mediated TAM activation. Here, we demonstrate that the EMT transcriptional factor Snail directly activates the transcription of MIR21 to produce miR-21-abundant tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs). The miR-21-containing exosomes were engulfed by CD14+ human monocytes, suppressing the expression of M1 markers and increasing that of M2 markers. Knockdown of miR-21 in Snail-expressing human head and neck cancer cells attenuated the Snail-induced M2 polarization, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. In head and neck cancer samples, a high expression of miR-21 was correlated with a higher level of SNAI1 and the M2 marker MRC1. This study elucidates the mechanism of EMT-mediated M2 polarization through delivery of the miR-21-abundant exosomes, which may serve as a candidate biomarker of tumor progression and provide a potential target for intercepting EMT-mediated TME remodeling.",

Spheroids were cultured from cancer cells alone (monospheroids) or as a mixture (mixed-cell spheroids) in ultra-low-attachment plates. Compact, well-mixed, and stroma-rich mixed-cell spheroids were successfully established with heterotypic cell-cell contacts shown by the presence of gap junctions and desmosomes. Mixed-cell spheroids showed enhanced expression of collagen type-I (Col\u2010I) and pro\u2010fibrotic factors such as, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-\u03b21), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) compared to the levels expressed in mono-spheroids. The EMT phenotype was evident in mixed-cell spheroids as shown by the altered expression of E-cadherin and vimentin. Differential drug sensitivity was observed in mixed-cell spheroids, and only sorafenib and oxaliplatin showed dose-dependent antiproliferative effects. Simultaneous treatment with TGF-\u03b2 inhibitors further improved sorafenib efficacy in the mixed-cell spheroids, indicating the involvement of TGF-\u03b2 in the mechanism of sorafenib resistance. In 3D matrix invasion assay, mixed-cell spheroids exhibited fibroblast-led collective cell movement. Overall, our results provide evidence that mixed-cell spheroids formed with Huh-7 and LX-2 cells well represent HCC tumors and their TME in vivo and hence are useful in studying tumor-stroma interactions as mechanisms associated with drug resistance and increased cell motility.",

Genomic breakpoints of KIF5B-MET were determined by targeted next-generation sequencing. Soft agar colony formation assays, proliferation assays, and a xenograft mouse model were used to investigate its oncogenic activity. In addition, specific MET inhibitors were administered to evaluate their anti-tumor activities. A KIF5B-MET fusion variant in a patient with a mixed-type adenocarcinoma and sarcomatoid tumor was identified, and another case was found in a pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinoma patient. Both cases carried the same chimeric gene, a fusion between exons 1\u201324 of KIF5B and exons 15\u201321 of MET. KIF5B-MET-overexpressing cells exhibited significantly increased proliferation and colony-forming ability. Xenograft tumors harboring the fusion gene demonstrated significantly elevated tumor growth. Ectopic expression of the fusion gene stimulated the phosphorylation of KIF5B-MET as well as downstream STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. The MET inhibitors significantly repressed cell proliferation; phosphorylation of downstream STAT3, AKT, and ERK1/2; and xenograft tumorigenicity.

Uncovering pathways and mechanisms involved in drug resistance is an urgent and critical aim for breast cancer research oriented to improve treatment efficacy. Here we show that Doxorubicin and other chemotherapeutic drugs induce the expression of ETV7, a transcriptional repressor member of ETS family of transcription factors. The ETV7 expression led to DNAJC15 down-regulation, a co-chaperone protein whose low expression was previously associated with drug resistance in breast and ovarian cancer. There was a corresponding reduction in Doxorubicin sensitivity of MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. We identified the binding site for ETV7 within DNAJC15 promoter and we also found that DNA methylation may be a factor in ETV7-mediated DNAJC15 transcriptional repression. These findings of an inverse correlation between ETV7 and DNAJC15 expression in MCF7 cells in terms of Doxorubicin resistance, correlated well with treatment responses of breast cancer patients with recurrent disease, based on our analyses of reported genome-wide expression arrays. Moreover, we demonstrated that ETV7-mediated Doxorubicin-resistance involves increased Doxorubicin efflux via nuclear pumps, which could be rescued in part by DNAJC15 up-regulation. With this study, we propose a novel role for ETV7 in breast cancer, and we identify DNAJC15 as a new target gene responsible for ETV7-mediated Doxorubicin-resistance. A better understanding of the opposing impacts of Doxorubicin could improve the design of combinatorial adjuvant regimens with the aim of avoiding resistance and relapse.",

However, there is a large variation between tumors from different patients in both histology and gene expression that is not well characterized. Here we use a meta-analysis of published microarray datasets to show that Favorable Histology Wilms' Tumors (FHWT's) fill a triangle-shaped continuum in gene expression space of which the vertices represent three idealized \u201carchetypes\u201d. We show that these archetypes have predominantly renal blastemal, stromal, and epithelial characteristics and that they correlate well with the three major lineages of the developing embryonic kidney.

These results illustrate the potential of this methodology for characterizing the cellular composition of Wilms' tumors and for assessing disease progression.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Widespread infiltration of tumor cells into surrounding brain parenchyma is a hallmark of malignant gliomas, but little data exist on the overall invasion pattern of tumor cells throughout the brain. METHODS: We have studied the invasive phenotype of malignant gliomas in two invasive mouse models and patients. Tumor invasion patterns were characterized in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model using brain-wide histological analysis and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Findings were histologically validated in a cdkn2a\u2212/\u2212 PDGF-\u03b2 lentivirus-induced mouse glioblastoma model. Clinical verification of the results was obtained by analysis of MR images of malignant gliomas. RESULTS: Histological analysis using human-specific cellular markers revealed invasive tumors with a non-radial invasion pattern. Tumors cells accumulated in structures located far from the transplant site, such as the optic white matter and pons, whereas certain adjacent regions were spared. As such, the hippocampus was remarkably free of infiltrating tumor cells despite the extensive invasion of surrounding regions. Similarly, MR images of xenografted mouse brains displayed tumors with bihemispheric pathology, while the hippocampi appeared relatively normal. In patients, most malignant temporal lobe gliomas were located lateral to the collateral sulcus. Despite widespread pathological fluid-attenuated inversion recovery signal in the temporal lobe, 74% of the \u201clateral tumors\u201d did not show signs of involvement of the amygdalo-hippocampal complex. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide clear evidence for a compartmental pattern of invasive growth in malignant gliomas. The observed invasion patterns suggest the presence of preferred migratory paths, as well as intra-parenchymal boundaries that may be difficult for glioma cells to traverse supporting the notion of compartmental growth. In both mice and human patients, the hippocampus appears to be a brain region that is less prone to tumor invasion.",

     "abstract": "A diagnosis of perineural invasion (PNI), defined as cancer within or surrounding at least 33% of the nerve, leads to selection of aggressive treatment in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Recent mechanistic studies show that cancer and nerves interact prior to physical contact. The purpose of this study was to explore cancer-nerve interactions relative to clinical outcome. Biopsy specimens from 71 patients with oral cavity SCC were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical (IHC; cytokeratin, S100, GAP43, Tuj1) stains. Using current criteria, PNI detection was increased with IHC. Overall survival (OS) tended to be poor for patients with PNI (P\u202f=\u202f.098). OS was significantly lower for patients with minimum tumor-nerve distance smaller than 5 \u03bcm (P\u202f=\u202f.011). The estimated relative death rate decreased as the nerve-tumor distance increased; there was a gradual drop off in death rate from distance equal to zero that stabilized around 500 \u03bcm. In PNI-negative patients, nerve diameter was significantly related to OS (HR 2.88, 95%CI[1.11,7.49]). Among PNI-negative nerves, larger nerve-tumor distance and smaller nerve diameter were significantly related to better OS, even when adjusting for T-stage and age (HR 0.82, 95% CI[0.72,0.92]; HR 1.27, 95% CI[1.00,1.62], respectively). GAP43, a marker for neuronal outgrowth, stained less than Tuj1 in nerves at greater distances from tumor (OR 0.76, 95% CI[0.73,0.79]); more GAP43 staining was associated with PNI. Findings from a small group of patients suggest that nerve parameters other than presence of PNI can influence outcome and that current criteria of PNI need to be re-evaluated to integrate recent biological discoveries.",

We report reverse-translational research using LIM1215 xenografts of RAS WT mCRC to elucidate the biologic mechanisms underlying this clinical observation. Sequential administration of panitumumab then bevacizumab (PB) demonstrated a stronger tendency to inhibit tumor growth than bevacizumab then panitumumab (BP). Cell proliferation was reduced significantly with PB (P\u202f<\u202f.01) but not with BP based on Ki-67 index. Phosphoproteomic analysis demonstrated reduced phosphorylation of EGFR and EPHA2 with PB and BP compared with control. Western blotting showed reduced EPHA2 expression and S897-phosphorylation with PB; RSK phosphorylation was largely unaffected by PB but increased significantly with BP. In quantitative real-time PCR analyses, PB significantly reduced the expression of both lipogenic (FASN, MVD) and hypoxia-related (CA9, TGFBI) genes versus control. These results suggest that numerous mechanisms at the levels of gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation may explain the improved clinical activity of PB over BP in patients with RAS WT mCRC.",

METHODS: We analyzed two prospective biomarker design trials of newly diagnosed RAS-WT mCRC patients treated with panitumumab-FOLFOX6 (PULSE trial; NCT01288339) or cetuximab plus either FOLFOX6/FOLFIRI (POSIBA trial; NCT01276379). The main exposure was DP phenotype (DP/non-DP), as assessed by two independent pathologists. DP cases were defined by immunohistochemistry as > 70% expression of moderate or strong intensity for both MMP-7 and pIGF-1R. Primary endpoint: progression-free survival (PFS); secondary endpoints: OS and response rate. PFS and OS were adjusted by baseline characteristics using multivariate Cox models. RESULTS: We analyzed 67 patients (30 non-DP, 37 DP) in the PULSE trial and 181 patients in the POSIBA trial (158 non-DP, 23 DP). Response rates and PFS were similar between groups in both studies. DP was associated with prolonged OS in PULSE (adjusted HR: 0.23; 95%CI: 0.11-0.52; P=.0004) and with shorter OS in POSIBA (adjusted HR: 1.67; 95%CI: 0.96-2.90; P=.07). CONCLUSION: A differential effect of anti-EGFRs on survival by DP phenotype was observed. Panitumumab might be more beneficial for RAS-WT mCRC patients with DP phenotype, whereas cetuximab might improve OS in non-DP.",

     "abstract": "The use of blood-circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) as a \u201cliquid biopsy\u201d in oncology is being explored for its potential as a cancer biomarker. Mitochondria contain their own circular genomic entity (mitochondrial DNA, mtDNA), up to even thousands of copies per cell. The mutation rate of mtDNA is several orders of magnitude higher than that of the nuclear DNA. Tumor-specific variants have been identified in tumors along the entire mtDNA, and their number varies among and within tumors. The high mtDNA copy number per cell and the high mtDNA mutation rate make it worthwhile to explore the potential of tumor-specific cf-mtDNA variants as cancer marker in the blood of cancer patients. We used single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to profile the entire mtDNA of 19 tissue specimens (primary tumor and/or metastatic sites, and tumor-adjacent normal tissue) and 9 cfDNA samples, originating from 8 cancer patients (5 breast, 3 colon). For each patient, tumor-specific mtDNA variants were detected and traced in cfDNA by SMRT sequencing and/or digital PCR to explore their feasibility as cancer biomarker. As a reference, we measured other blood-circulating biomarkers for these patients, including driver mutations in nuclear-encoded cfDNA and cancer-antigen levels or circulating tumor cells. Four of the 24 (17%) tumor-specific mtDNA variants were detected in cfDNA, however at much lower allele frequencies compared to mutations in nuclear-encoded driver genes in the same samples. Also, extensive heterogeneity was observed among the heteroplasmic mtDNA variants present in an individual. We conclude that there is limited value in tracing tumor-specific mtDNA variants in blood-circulating cfDNA with the current methods available.",

To test whether mtBRCA1 or mtBRCA2 nonmalignant FTE cells respond differently to periovulatory FF exposure than control patient FTE cells, gene expression profiles from primary FTE cultures derived from BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers or control patients were compared at baseline, 24 hours after FF exposure, and 24 hours after FF replacement with culture medium. Hierarchical clustering revealed both FF exposure and BRCA mutation status affect gene expression, with BRCA1 mutation having the greatest impact. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed increased NF\u03baB and EGFR signaling at baseline in mtBRCA1 samples, with increased interferon target gene expression, including members of the ISGylation pathway, observed after recovery from FF exposure. Gene set enrichment analysis did not identify altered pathway signaling in mtBRCA2 samples. An inverse relationship between EGFR signaling and ISGylation with BRCA1 protein levels was verified in an immortalized FTE cell line, OE-E6/E7, stably transfected with BRCA1 cDNA. Suppression of ISG15 and ISGylated protein levels by increased BRCA1 expression was found to be mediated by decreased NF\u03baB signaling. These studies indicate that increased NF\u03baB signaling associated with decreased BRCA1 expression results in increased ISG15 and protein ISGylation following FF exposure, which may be involved in predisposition to HGSOC.",

Moreover, the same increase was achieved when temozolomide was given to wild-type mice in combination with the dual P-gp/BCRP inhibitor elacridar (GF120918). The antitumor efficacy of temozolomide against three different intracranial tumor models was significantly enhanced when Abcb1a/b and Abcg2 were genetically deficient or pharmacologically inhibited in recipient mice.

Sunitinib-treated and untreated control tumors of two PDAC xenograft models (BxPC-3 and Panc-1) were subjected to DCE-MRI before the imaged tumors were prepared for quantitative analysis of immunohistochemical preparations. Pimonidazole was used as a hypoxia marker, and fraction of hypoxic tissue (HFPim), density of CD31-positive microvessels (MVDCD31), and density of \u03b1SMA-positive microvessels (MVD\u03b1SMA) were measured. Parametric images of Ktrans and ve were derived from the DCE-MRI data by using the Tofts pharmacokinetic model. BxPC-3 tumors showed increased HFPim, decreased MVDCD31, unchanged MVD\u03b1SMA, and increased vessel maturation index (VMI\u202f=\u202fMVD\u03b1SMA/MVDCD31) after sunitinib treatment. The increase in VMI was seen because sunitinib induced selective pruning rather than maturation of \u03b1SMA-negative microvessels. Even though the microvessels in sunitinib-treated tumors were less abnormal than those in untreated tumors, this microvessel normalization did not improve the function of the microvascular network or normalize the tumor microenvironment. In Panc-1 tumors, HFPim, MVDCD31, MVD\u03b1SMA, and VMI were unchanged after sunitinib treatment. Median Ktrans increased with increasing MVDCD31 and decreased with increasing HFPim, and the correlations were similar for treated and untreated BXPC-3 and Panc-1 tumors. These observations suggest that sunitinib may induce significant changes in the microenvironment of PDACs, and furthermore, that Ktrans may be an adequate measure of tumor vascular density and hypoxia in untreated as well as sunitinib-treated PDACs.",

Unfortunately, the underlying mechanism behind this metastasis remains unknown. Mounting evidence suggests the dynamic regulatory role of sirtuin2 (SIRT2), a histone deacetylase (HDAC), in cell migration and invasion. The present study aims to evaluate the biological function of SIRT2 in GC and identify the target of SIRT2 as well as evaluate its therapeutic efficacy. We found that SIRT2 was upregulated in GC tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues, and this was correlated with reduced patient survival. Although CCK8 and colony-formation assays showed that SIRT2 overexpression marginally promoted proliferation in GC cell lines, SIRT2 knockdown or treatment with SirReal2 decreased the migration and invasion of GC cells. We demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that SirReal2 could inhibit the deacetylation activity of SIRT2 and its downstream target PEPCK1, which is related to mitochondrial metabolism and RAS/ERK/JNK/MMP-9 pathway. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that SirReal2 selectively targets SIRT2 and decreases migration as well as invasion in human GC cells. SirReal2 therefore shows promise as a new drug candidate for GC therapy.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) progression involves a shift from endocrine to paracrine and eventually autocrine control resulting from alterations in molecular mechanisms in the cells. Deregulation of RNA translation is crucial for tumor cells to grow and proliferate; therefore, overactivation of the translation machinery is often observed in cancer. The two most important signal transduction pathways regulating PCa progression are PI3K/Akt/mTOR and Ras/MAPK. These two pathways converge on the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) which binds to the protein scaffold eIF4G upon mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) activation and is phosphorylated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) interacting protein kinases (Mnk1/2). This review describes the role of eIF4E in mRNA translation initiation mediated by its binding to the methylated 5\u2032 terminal structure (m7G-cap) of many mRNAs, and the ability of many tumor cells to bypass this mechanism. Hormonal therapy and chemotherapy are two of the most prevalent therapies used in patients with advanced PCa, and studies have implicated a role for eIF4E phosphorylation in promoting resistance to both these therapies. It appears that eIF4E phosphorylation enhances the rate of translation of oncogene mRNAs to increase tumorigenicity.",

     "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that dysregulation of iron regulatory factors may play essential roles in cancer pathophysiology. Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate 3 (STEAP3) is a metalloreductase, which is vital for cellular iron uptake and homeostasis. However, the clinical significance and function of STEAP3 in the development of human gliomas remain unclear. Through analysis of publicly available databases, we found that STEAP3 was highly expressed in malignant gliomas, especially in the mesenchymal glioma molecular subtype and isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) wild-type gliomas. Expression levels of STEAP3 in gliomas correlated inversely with patient overall survival (OS) and served as an independent prognostic marker by multivariate Cox regression analysis. In functional assays performed with RNA knockdown, loss of STEAP3 attenuated aggressive phenotypes in glioma cells, including cell proliferation, invasion, and sphere formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Finally, STEAP3 drives these activities by inducing mesenchymal transition, promoting transferrin receptor (TfR) expression, and activating STAT3-FoxM1 axis signaling. Taken together, these results indicate that STEAP3 functions as an oncogenic mediator in glioma progression and is thus a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of the disease.",

Although recognized as an AMP mimetic activator of the protein kinase AMPK, the AICAR monophosphate derivative ZMP was also shown to mediate AMPK-independent effects. In order to unveil these AMPK-independent functions, we performed a transcriptomic analysis in AMPK\u03b11/\u03b12 double knockout murine embryonic cells. Kinetic analysis of the cellular response to AICAR revealed the up-regulation of the large tumor suppressor kinases (Lats) 1 and 2 transcripts, followed by the repression of numerous genes downstream of the transcriptional regulators Yap1 and Taz. This transcriptional signature, together with the observation of increased levels in phosphorylation of Lats1 and Yap1 proteins, suggested that the Hippo signaling pathway was activated by AICAR. This effect was observed in both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Knockdown of Lats1/2 prevented the cytoplasmic delocalization of Yap1/Taz proteins in response to AICAR and conferred a higher resistance to the drug. These results indicate that activation of the most downstream steps of the Hippo cascade participates to the antiproliferative effects of AICAR.",

     "abstract": "PTEN loss has been associated with poorer prognosis in many solid tumors. However, such investigation in lymphomas is limited. In this study, PTEN cytoplasmic and nuclear expression, PTEN gene deletion, and PTEN mutations were evaluated in two independent cohorts of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Cytoplasmic PTEN expression was found in approximately 67% of total 747 DLBCL cases, more frequently in the activated B-cell\u2013like subtype. Nuclear PTEN expression was less frequent and at lower levels, which significantly correlated with higher PTEN mRNA expression. Remarkably, loss of PTEN protein expression was associated with poorer survival only in DLBCL with AKT hyperactivation. In contrast, high PTEN expression was associated with Myc expression and poorer survival in cases without abnormal AKT activation. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms for loss of PTEN expression were investigated. PTEN deletions (mostly heterozygous) were detected in 11.3% of DLBCL, and showed opposite prognostic effects in patients with AKT hyperactivation and in MYC rearranged DLBCL patients. PTEN mutations, detected in 10.6% of patients, were associated with upregulation of genes involved in central nervous system function, metabolism, and AKT/mTOR signaling regulation. Loss of PTEN cytoplasmic expression was also associated with TP53 mutations, higher PTEN-targeting microRNA expression, and lower PD-L1 expression. Remarkably, low PTEN mRNA expression was associated with down-regulation of a group of genes involved in immune responses and B-cell development/differentiation, and poorer survival in DLBCL independent of AKT activation. Collectively, multi-levels of PTEN abnormalities and dysregulation may play important roles in PTEN expression and loss, and that loss of PTEN tumor-suppressor function contributes to the poor survival of DLBCL patients with AKT hyperactivation.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third most lethal cancer worldwide. Despite progress in identifying risk factors, the incidence of HCC is increasing. Moreover, therapeutic options are limited and survival is poor. Therefore, alternative and innovative therapeutic strategies are urgently required. R-Tf-D-LP4, a cell-penetrating peptide derived from the mitochondrial multifunctional protein the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1), is identified here as a highly effective liver cancer treatment. Recently, we demonstrated that R-Tf-D-LP4 induced apoptosis and inhibited tumor growth in mouse models. We now demonstrate that R-Tf-D-LP4 induced apoptosis in cancer liver-derived cell lines and inhibited tumor growth in three different liver cancer mouse models. These included diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCC, metabolically high-fat diet\u2013induced HCC, and using a subcutaneous HepG2 cell xenograft model. Intravenous injection of the peptide into tumor-carrying DEN-treated mice resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth up to complete tumor elimination. TUNEL staining of liver sections demonstrated peptide-induced apoptosis. Hematoxylin/eosin and Sirius red staining of liver sections showed decreased fibrotic formation. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated reduced numbers of \u03b1-SMA\u2013expressing cells in R-Tf-D-LP4\u2013treated mouse livers. Additionally, macrophage presence in liver tissue was reduced in R-Tf-D-LP4\u2013treated mice. Liver sections from DEN-treated mice showed steatohepatic pathology, reflected as fatty liver, inflammation, ballooning degeneration, and fibrosis; all were eliminated upon peptide treatment. Peptide treatment also inhibited tumor development in a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis\u2013hepatocellular carcinoma mouse model induced by HFD. In HepG2 subcutaneous tumor xenografts, R-Tf-D-LP4 inhibited tumor growth. Conclusion: These results show that the VDAC1-based peptide R-Tf-D-LP4 has multiple effects on liver cancer cells, leading to impairment of cell energy and metabolism homeostasis, induction of apoptosis, and elimination of liver cancer-associated processes, and thus represents a promising therapeutic approach for liver cancer.",

Progress to date mostly reflects the use of immortalized cancer cell lines, and progression to primary patient-derived tumor cells is needed to realize the full potential of these platforms. For the first time, we report endothelial sprouting induced by primary patient tumor cells in a 3D microfluidic system. Specifically, we have combined primary human clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cells from six independent donors with human endothelial cells in a vascularized, flow-directed, 3D culture system (\u201cccRCC-on-a-chip\u201d). The upregulation of key angiogenic factors in primary human ccRCC cells, which exhibited unique patterns of donor variation, was further enhanced when they were cultured in 3D clusters. When embedded in the matrix surrounding engineered human vessels, these ccRCC tumor clusters drove potent endothelial cell sprouting under continuous flow, thus recapitulating the critical angiogenic signaling axis between human ccRCC cells and endothelial cells. Importantly, this phenotype was driven by a primary tumor cell\u2013derived biochemical gradient of angiogenic growth factor accumulation that was subject to pharmacological blockade. Our novel 3D system represents a vascularized tumor model that is easy to image and quantify and is fully tunable in terms of input cells, perfusate, and matrices. We envision that this ccRCC-on-a-chip will be valuable for mechanistic studies, for studying tumor-vascular cell interactions, and for developing novel and personalized antitumor therapies.",

Despite age being a significant risk factor for the development of this cancer, there are little published data which address the impact of aging on ovarian cancer metastasis. Here we report that the aged host is more susceptible to metastatic success using two murine syngeneic allograft models of ovarian cancer metastasis. This age-related increase in metastatic tumor burden corresponds with an increase in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumor-bearing mice and alteration of B cell-related pathways in gonadal adipose tissue. Based on this work, further studies elucidating the status of B cell TILs in mouse models of metastasis and human tumors in the context of aging are warranted.",

ALL LSCs expressed CD19 (B4), CD44 (Pgp-1), CD123 (IL-3RA), and CD184 (CXCR4) in all patients tested. Moreover, in various subgroups of patients, LSCs also displayed CD20 (MS4A1) (10/41\u202f=\u202f24%), CD22 (12/20\u202f=\u202f60%), CD33 (Siglec-3) (20/48\u202f=\u202f42%), CD52 (CAMPATH-1) (17/40\u202f=\u202f43%), IL-1RAP (13/29\u202f=\u202f45%), and/or CD135 (FLT3) (4/20\u202f=\u202f20%). CD25 (IL-2RA) and CD26 (DPPIV) were expressed on LSCs in Ph+ ALL exhibiting BCR/ABL1p210, whereas in Ph+ ALL with BCR/ABL1p190, LSCs variably expressed CD25 but did not express CD26. In Ph\u2212 ALL, CD34+/CD38\u2212 LSCs expressed IL-1RAP in 6/18 patients (33%), but did not express CD25 or CD26. Normal stem cells stained negative for CD25, CD26 and IL-1RAP, and expressed only low amounts of CD52. In xenotransplantation experiments, CD34+/CD38\u2212 and CD34+/CD38+ cells engrafted NSG mice after 12\u201320 weeks, and targeting with antibodies against CD33 and CD52 resulted in reduced engraftment.

In Ph+ ALL with BCR/ABL1p210, the LSC-phenotype closely resembles the marker-profile of CD34+/CD38\u2212 LSCs in chronic myeloid leukemia, confirming the close biologic relationship of these neoplasms.

Here, we showed that POH1 expression was increased and associated with poor outcomes in three independent cohorts of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal cancer (EC), and colorectal cancer (CRC). The knockdown of POH1 significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial pathway in vitro. Intratumoral injection of POH1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly reduced the progression of tumor growth and induced apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, p53 or Bim siRNA markedly attenuated the apoptosis induced by POH1 depletion. POH1 depletion resulted in cell apoptosis by increasing the stability of p53 and Bim and inhibiting their ubiquitination. Overall, POH1 knockdown induced cell apoptosis through increased expression of p53 and Bim via enhanced protein stability and attenuated degradation.

The telomere quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay has become an important tool for epidemiological studies examining the effects of aging, stress, and other factors on the length of telomeres. Current telomere qPCR methods analyze the relative length of telomeres by amplifying telomere sequence products and normalizing with single-copy gene products. However, the current telomere qPCR does not always reflect absolute telomere length in cancer DNA. Because of genomic instability in cancer cells, we hypothesized that the use of single-copy genes (scg) is less accurate for normalizing data in cancer DNA and that new primer sets are required to better represent relative telomere length in cancer DNA. We first confirmed that cancer cells had a different copy ratio among different scg, implying that DNA is aneuploid. By using the new primer sets that amplify multiple-copy sequences (mcs) throughout the genome, the telomere qPCR results showed that the mcs primers were interchangeable with the scg primers as reference primers in normal DNA. By comparing results from the traditional southern blotting method (as kilobases) and results from monochrome multiplex qPCR using the mcs primers (as T/M ratios), we verified that the T/M ratio is highly correlated with absolute telomere length from the southern blot analysis. Together, the mcs primers were able to represent the telomere lengths accurately in cancer DNA samples. These results would allow for analyses of telomeres within cancerous DNA and the development of new, less invasive diagnostic tools for cancer.",

While the cure rate for medulloblastoma exceeds 70%, this figure has stagnated over the past few decades and survivors still contend with significant long-term debilitating side effects. The prognosis for pineoblastoma is age-dependent, with little chance of a cure for children younger than three years. More effective molecularly targeted strategies are urgently required to treat these cancers. Hyper-activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is characteristic of several different classes of human cancers, including a subset of glioblastoma and medulloblastoma. This has provided the impetus for the development of a suite of EGFR pathway blockers, including second generation irreversible inhibitors, such as dacomitinib. We have developed a comprehensive drug evaluation pipeline, including in vitro interaction analyses and orthotopic xenograft mouse models, to address the efficacy of drugs for brain tumor treatment, enabling the exclusion of potentially ineffective treatments and prioritization of truly beneficial novel treatments for clinical trial. We used this system to examine the effects of dacomitinib as a single agent, or in combination with conventional chemotherapeutics, on the growth of human adult and pediatric brain tumor cell lines. Dacomitinib inhibited EGFR or EGFRvIII activity in vitro in all three tumor types tested, and as a single agent induced a modest increase in survival time for mice bearing glioblastoma, which accurately predicted human clinical trial data. For pediatric medulloblastoma, dacomitinib blocked EGFR/HER signalling in orthotopic xenografts and extended median survival as a single agent, however was antagonistic when used in combination with standard frontline medulloblastoma chemotherapies. The findings caution against the use of dacomitinib for pediatric brain tumor clinical trials.",

These lymphomas were monoclonal, Epstein Barr Virus (EBV) positive, originated tumorigenic cell cultures and displayed a mutational burden and an expression profile distinct from gastric adenocarcinomas. The ability of grafted samples to develop lymphomas did not correlate with patient outcome, nor with the histotype, the lymphocyte infiltration level, or the EBV status of the original gastric tumor, impeding from foreseeing lymphoma onset. Interestingly, lymphoma development was significantly more frequent when primary rather than metastatic samples were grafted.Notably, the development of such lympho-proliferative disease could be prevented by a short rituximab treatment upon mice implant, without negatively affecting gastric carcinoma engraftment.Due to the high frequency of human lymphoma onset, our data show that a careful histologic analysis is mandatory when generating gastric cancer PDXs.

Inhibition of mutant BRAF is a current frontline therapy for such cases, with improved survival compared with chemotherapy. Unfortunately, reactivation of MAPK signaling by several mechanisms has been shown to cause drug resistance and disease recurrence. In this work, we describe the co-occurrence of an in-frame deletion within an amplified BRAFV600E locus and a missense point mutation of the transcriptional repressor BCORL1 in vemurafenib-resistant A375 melanoma cells. Functional data confirmed that truncated p47BRAFV600E and mutant BCORL1Q1076H both contribute to resistance. Interestingly, either endogenous BCORL1 silencing or ectopic BCORL1Q1076H expression mimicked the effects of a CRISPR/Cas9-edited BCORL1Q1076H locus, suggesting a complex mixture of loss- and gain-of-function effects caused by the mutation. Transcriptomic data confirmed this hypothesis. Finally, we show that the pan-RAF inhibitor sorafenib is not affected by expression of BRAF deletion variant and effectively synergizes with vemurafenib to block resistant cells, suggesting a possible intervention for this class of mutants.",

The selective WEE1 inhibitor, AZD1775, has shown strong anti-proliferative effects on a variety of tumors. Here, we first demonstrate that inhibition of ATR by selective inhibitor AZD6738 can enhance AZD1775-caused growth inhibition in TNBC. Our results show that the enhanced cell death is attributed to repressed DNA damage repair and excessive replication stress, thereby causing increased DNA damage reflected by accumulation of the DNA double-strand-break marker \u03b3H2AX. On the other hand, combined treatment with AZD6738 and AZD1775 forces mitotic entry of cells with DNA damages by activating CDK1 activity, inducing severely aberrant mitosis and mitotic catastrophe, ultimately resulting in cell death. Dual inhibition of WEE1 and ATR also inactivated RAD51-mediated homologous recombination, which sensitized TNBC cells to cisplatin and PARP inhibitor. Here, based on the preclinical results that ATR inhibition synergizes with WEE1 inhibition in TNBC, we propose that this combination therapy alone, or in parallel with chemotherapy, represents an innovative and potent targeted therapy in TNBC.",

We showed that STAT3 binds directly to a regulatory region within the TNFRSF1A gene, and that TNFRSF1A levels are dependent on STAT3 function in both constitutive and cytokine-induced models of STAT3 activation. Furthermore, TNFRSF1A is a major mediator of both basal and TNF\u03b1-induced NF-\u03baB activity in breast cancer cells. We extended these findings to primary human breast cancers, in which we found that high TNFRSF1A transcript levels correlated with STAT3 activation. In addition, and consistent with a causal role, increased TNFRSF1A expression was associated with an NF-\u03baB gene expression in signature in breast cancers. Thus, TNFRSF1A is a STAT3 target gene that regulates the NF-\u03baB pathway. These findings reveal a novel functional crosstalk between STAT3 and NF-\u03baB signaling in breast cancer. Furthermore, elevated TNFRSF1A levels may predict a subset of breast tumors that are sensitive to STAT3 transcriptional inhibitors, and may be a biomarker for response to inhibition of this pathway.",

     "abstract": "Salmonella infection is a major public health concern, and colonization in humans can be chronic and increases the risk of cancers. Wnt signaling is a key pathway for intestinal renewal and development, inflammation, and tumorigenesis. In the current study, we report a novel role of Wnt1 in infection and colon cancer using cell culture models, a Salmonella-colitis colon cancer model, and human samples. In contrast to the bacteria-induced increases in Wnt2 and Wnt11, Salmonella colonization significantly reduced the level of Wnt1 in intestinal epithelial cells in vivo and in vitro. The bacterial AvrA protein is known to activate the canonical Wnt pathway. Wnt1 expression level was downregulated by AvrA-expressing Salmonella but stabilized by AvrA-deficient Salmonella in the intestine of Salmonella-colitis mice. In a chronic Salmonella-infected cancer model, the Wnt1 protein level was decreased in the AvrA+ infected group. Thus, we further assessed the functional role of Wnt1 downregulation in the inflammatory response and colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Moreover, downregulation of Wnt1 by the Crispr-Cas9 method affected cancer cell invasion and migration. Interestingly, we found that Wnt1 was downregulated in human CRC tissue, and Wnt1 downregulation may be correlated with cancer progression. Our study provides insights into mechanisms by which enteric bacteria regulate Wnt1 expression and potentially contribute to infection-associated colon cancer.",

Here, we characterized for the first time the expression of pro-apoptotic receptors, tumor necrosis-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptors (TRAILR1-4) within an established human DSRCT cell line and clinical samples. The molecular induction of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis using agonistic small molecule, ONC201 in vitro cell-based proliferation assay and in vivo novel orthotopic xenograft animal models of DSRCT, was able to inhibit cell proliferation that was associated with caspase activation, and tumor growth, indicating that a cell-based delivery of an apoptosis-inducing factor could be relevant therapeutic agent to control DSRCT.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers and it usually develops from a background of liver fibrosis or inflammation. The crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells plays an important and stimulating role during tumor progression. Previously we found in a krasV12\u2013induced zebrafish HCC model that oncogenic hepatocytes activate hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by up-regulation of serotonin and activate neutrophils and macrophages by up-regulation of cortisol. In the present study, we found a novel signaling transduction mechanism between oncogenic hepatocytes and HSCs. After krasV12 induction, fibrinogen was up-regulated in oncogenic hepatocytes. We reasoned that fibrinogen may bind to integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 on HSCs to activate HSCs. Consistent with this notion, pharmaceutical treatment using an antagonist of integrin \u03b1v\u03b25, cilengitide, significantly blocked HSC activation and function, accompanied by attenuated proliferation of oncogenic hepatocytes and progression of liver fibrosis. On the contrary, adenosine 5\u2019-diphosphate, an agonist of \u03b1v\u03b25, activated HSCs significantly that further stimulated the tumor progression and liver fibrosis. Interestingly, in human liver disease samples, we detected an increased level of fibrinogen during tumor progression which indicated the potential role of fibrinogen signaling in HCC progression. Thus, we concluded a novel interaction between oncogenic hepatocytes and HSCs through the fibrinogen related pathway in both the zebrafish HCC model and human liver disease samples.",

Here, we show that human MGMT associates with PCNA and in turn, with the cell cycle inhibitor, p21cip1 in glioblastoma and other cancer cell lines. MGMT protein was shown to harbor a nearly perfect P CNA- I nteracting P rotein (PIP box) motif. Isogenic p53-null H1299 cells were engineered to express the p21 protein by two different procedures. Reciprocal immunoprecipitation/western blotting, Far-western blotting, and confocal microscopy confirmed the specific association of MGMT with PCNA and the ability of p21 to strongly disrupt the MGMT-PCNA complexes in tumor cells. Alkylation DNA damage resulted in a greater colocalization of MGMT and PCNA proteins, particularly in HCT116 cells deficient in p21 expression. p21 expression in isogenic cell lines directly correlated with markedly higher levels of MGMT mRNA, protein, activity and greater resistance to alkylating agents. In other experiments, four glioblastoma cell lines synchronized at the G1/S phase using either double thymidine or thymidine-mimosine blocks and subsequent cycling consistently showed a loss of MGMT protein at mid- to late S-phase, irrespective of the cell line, suggesting such a downregulation is fundamental to cell cycle control. MGMT protein was also specifically degraded in extracts from S-phase cells and evidence strongly suggested the involvement of PCNA-dependent CRL4Cdt2 ubiquitin-ligase in the reaction. Overall, these data provide the first evidence for non-repair functions of MGMT in cell cycle and highlight the involvement of PCNA in MGMT downregulation, with p21 attenuating the process.",

However, despite their importance, whether there is a mutual interaction between COX-2 and YAP and how they regulate each other are not clear. In this paper, we showed that COX-2 overexpression in HCC cell lines resulted in increased levels of YAP mRNA, protein, and its target genes. COX-2 promoted proliferation of HCC cell lines, and knockdown of YAP antagonized this effect. In addition, our results indicated that EP2 and Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin mediate the transcriptional induction of YAP by COX-2. On the other hand, YAP increased COX-2 expression at the level of transcription requiring intact TEAD binding sites in the COX-2 promoter. Collectively, these findings indicated that COX-2 is not only a stimulus of YAP but also a target of Hippo-YAP pathway, thus forming a positive feedback circuit, COX-2-PGE2-EP2-G\u03b1s-\u03b2-catenin-YAP-COX-2. In a further study, we showed that inhibition of YAP and COX-2 acted synergistically and more efficiently reduced the growth of HCC cells and tumor formation than either of them alone, suggesting that dual governing of YAP and COX-2 may lead to the discovery of promising therapeutic strategies for HCC patients via blocking this positive feedback loop.",

     "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is one of the commonest and deadliest solid tumours of childhood, and is thought to result from disrupted differentiation of the developing sympathoadrenergic lineage of the neural crest. Neuroblastoma exhibits intra- and intertumoural heterogeneity, with high risk tumours characterised by poor differentiation, which can be attributable to MYCN-mediated repression of genes involved in neuronal differentiation. MYCN is known to co-operate with oncogenic signalling pathways such as Alk, Akt and MEK/ERK signalling, and, together with c-MYC has been shown to be activated by Wnt signalling in various tissues. However, our previous work demonstrated that Wnt3a/Rspo2 treatment of some neuroblastoma cell lines can, paradoxically, decrease c-MYC and MYCN proteins. This prompted us to define the neuroblastoma-specific Wnt3a/Rspo2-driven transcriptome using RNA sequencing, and characterise the accompanying changes in cell biology. Here we report the identification of ninety Wnt target genes, and show that Wnt signalling is upstream of numerous transcription factors and signalling pathways in neuroblastoma. Using live-cell imaging, we show that Wnt signalling can drive differentiation of SK-N-BE(2)-C and SH-SY5Y cell-lines, but, conversely, proliferation of SK-N-AS cells. We show that cell-lines that differentiate show induction of pro-differentiation BMP4 and EPAS1 proteins, which is not apparent in the SK-N-AS cells. In contrast, SK-N-AS cells show increased CCND1, phosphorylated RB and E2F1 in response to Wnt3a/Rspo2, consistent with their proliferative response, and these proteins are not increased in differentiating lines. By meta-analysis of the expression of our 90 genes in primary tumour gene expression databases, we demonstrate discrete expression patterns of our Wnt genes in patient cohorts with different prognosis. Furthermore our analysis reveals interconnectivity within subsets of our Wnt genes, with one subset comprised of novel putative drivers of neuronal differentiation repressed by MYCN. Assessment of \u03b2-catenin immunohistochemistry shows high levels of \u03b2-catenin in tumours with better differentiation, further supporting a role for canonical Wnt signalling in neuroblastoma differentiation.",

Here, RNA-seq analyses identified differentially regulated genes in response to concurrent knockdown of p53 and EAF2. Several of these genes were associated with the STAT3 signaling pathway, and this was verified by significantly increased p-STAT3 immunostaining in the Eaf2\u2212/\u2212p53\u2212/\u2212 mouse prostate. STAT3 knockdown abrogated the stimulation of C4-2 cell proliferation by concurrent knockdown of EAF2 and p53. Furthermore, immunostaining of p-STAT3 was increased in human prostate cancer specimens with EAF2 downregulation and/or p53 nuclear staining.

Using RNA sequencing data for 409 patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas, we examined miRNA differential expression between cancer and normal tissues and associated differentially expressed miRNAs with patient survival and clinical variables. We then correlated miRNA expressions with genomic alterations using the Wilcoxon test and REVEALER. We found a panel of six miRNAs dysregulated in bladder cancer and exhibited correlations to patient survival. We also performed differential expression analysis and clinical variable correlations to identify miRNAs associated with tobacco smoking, the most important risk factor for bladder cancer. Two miRNAs, miR-323a and miR-431, were differentially expressed in smoking patients compared to nonsmoking patients and were associated with primary tumor size. Functional studies of these miRNAs and the genomic features we identified for potential stratification may reveal underlying mechanisms of bladder cancer carcinogenesis and further diagnosis and treatment methods for urothelial bladder carcinoma.",

Acidic bile can accelerate NF-\u03baB activation and molecular events, linked to premalignant changes in murine hypopharyngeal mucosa (HM). We hypothesize that short-term in vivo topical application of NF-\u03baB inhibitor BAY 11-7082 can prevent acidic bile\u2013induced early preneoplastic molecular events, suggesting its potential role in disease prevention. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We topically exposed HM (C57Bl/6j wild-type) to a mixture of bile acids at pH 3.0 with and without BAY 11-7082 3 times/day for 7 days. We used immunofluorescence, Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and polymerase chain reaction microarrays to identify NF-\u03baB activation and its associated oncogenic mRNA and miRNA phenotypes, in murine hypopharyngeal cells in vitro and in murine HM in vivo. RESULTS: Short-term exposure of HM to acidic bile is a potent stimulus accelerating the expression of NF-\u03baB signaling (70 out of 84 genes) and oncogenic molecules. Topical application of BAY 11-7082 sufficiently blocks the effect of acidic bile. BAY 11-7082 eliminates NF-\u03baB activation in regenerating basal cells of acidic bile\u2013treated HM and prevents overexpression of molecules central to head and neck cancer, including bcl-2, STAT3, EGFR, TNF-\u03b1, and WNT5A.

CONCLUSION: There is novel evidence that acidic bile\u2013induced NF-\u03baB\u2013related oncogenic mRNA and miRNA phenotypes are generated after short-term 7-day mucosal exposure and that topical mucosal application of BAY 11-7082 can prevent the acidic bile\u2013induced molecular alterations associated with unregulated cell growth and proliferation of hypopharyngeal cells.",

While early detection and improved treatment have led to reduced mortality, even for those with metastatic cancer, some patients still respond poorly to treatment. Understanding the mechanisms of metastasis is important to improve prognostication, to stratify patients for treatment, and to identify new targets for therapy. We have shown previously that expression of nephronectin (NPNT) is correlated with metastatic propensity in breast cancer cell lines. In the present study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the expression pattern and distribution of NPNT in breast cancer tissue from 842 patients by immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays from a historic cohort. Several patterns of NPNT staining were observed. An association between granular cytoplasmic staining (in <10% of tumor cells) and poor prognosis was found. We suggest that granular cytoplasmic staining may represent NPNT-positive exosomes. We found that NPNT promotes adhesion and anchorage-independent growth via its integrin-binding and enhancer motifs and that enforced expression in breast tumor cells promotes their colonization of the lungs. We propose that NPNT may be a novel prognostic marker in a subgroup of breast cancer patients.",

CEACAM1 has a dual role in melanoma, including facilitation of cell proliferation and suppression of infiltrating lymphocytes, which are consistent with its value as a marker for poor prognosis in melanoma patients. Here we show that BRAFV600E melanoma cells treated with BRAF and MEK inhibitors (MAPKi) downregulate CEACAM1 mRNA and protein expression in a dose- and exposure time\u2013dependent manners. Indeed, there is a significant correlation between the presence of BRAFV600E and CEACAM1 expression in melanoma specimens obtained from 45 patients. Vemurafenib-resistant cell systems reactivate the MAPK pathway and restore basal CEACAM1 mRNA and protein levels. These combined results suggest transcriptional regulation. Indeed, luciferase reporting assays show that CEACAM1 promoter (CEACAM1p) activity is significantly reduced by MAPKi. Importantly, we show that the MAPK-driven CEACAM1p activity is mediated by ETS1, a major transcription factor and downstream effector of the MAPK pathway. Phosphorylation mutant ETS1T38A shows a dominant negative effect over CEACAM1 expression. The data are consistent with independent RNAseq data from serial biopsies of melanoma patients treated with BRAF inhibitors, which demonstrate similar CEACAM1 downregulation. Finally, we show that CEACAM1 downregulation by MAPKi renders the cells more sensitive to T-cell activation. These results provide a new view on a potential immunological mechanism of action of MAPKi in melanoma, as well as on the aggressive phenotype observed in drug-resistant cells.",

     "abstract": "Cross talk of stromal-epithelial cells plays an essential role in both normal development and tumor initiation and progression. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-FGF receptor (FGFR)-Src kinase axis is one of the major signal transduction pathways to mediate this cross talk. Numerous genomic studies have demonstrated that expression levels of FGFR/Src are deregulated in a variety of cancers including prostate cancer; however, the role that paracrine FGF (from stromal cells) plays in dysregulated expression of epithelial FGFRs/Src and tumor progression in vivo is not well evaluated. In this study, we demonstrate that ectopic expression of wild-type FGFR1/2 or Src kinase in epithelial cells was not sufficient to initiate prostate tumorigenesis under a normal stromal microenvironment in vivo. However, paracrine FGF10 synergized with ectopic expression of epithelial FGFR1 or FGFR2 to induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Additionally, paracrine FGF10 sensitized FGFR2-transformed epithelial cells to initiate prostate tumorigenesis. Next, paracrine FGF10 also synergized with overexpression of epithelial Src kinase to high-grade tumors. But loss of the myristoylation site in Src kinase inhibited paracrine FGF10-induced prostate tumorigenesis. Loss of myristoylation alters Src levels in the cell membrane and inhibited FGF-mediated signaling including inhibition of the phosphotyrosine pattern and FAK phosphorylation. Our study demonstrates the potential tumor progression by simultaneous deregulation of proteins in the FGF/FGFRs/Src signal axis and provides a therapeutic strategy of targeting myristoylation of Src kinase to interfere with the tumorigenic process.",

Our previous studies demonstrated that with wild-type p53, Plk2 impacts mTOR signaling in the same manner as TSC1, and Plk2-deficient tumors grew larger than control. Other investigators have demonstrated that Plk2 phosphorylates mutant p53 in a positive feedback loop. We investigated Plk2\u2019s tumor suppressor functions in relationship to mTOR signaling. Archival specimens from 12 colorectal adenocarcinomas were stained for markers including Plk2, phosphorylated mTOR (serine 2448) and ribosomal S6 (Serine 235/236). We show that Plk2 is expressed in normal colon, with a punctate staining pattern in supranuclear cytoplasm. In colorectal adenocarcinoma, Plk2 demonstrates complete or partial loss of expression. Strong expression of phosphorylated mTOR is observed in the invasive front. Phosphorylated S6 expression partially correlates with phosphorylated mTOR expression but appears more diffuse in some cases. p53 and Ki67 expression is diffuse, in the subset of cases examined. In order to determine whether Plk2 is lost prior to the development of invasive cancer, 8 colon polyps from 6 patients were evaluated for Plk2 expression. All polyps are positive for Plk2. A Cancer Genome Atlas search identified Plk2 mutations to be infrequent in colorectal adenocarcinomas. Neither Plk2 methylation (in the gene body) nor copy number variations correlated with changes in mRNA expression levels. Loss of Plk2 expression along with accentuated expression of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated S6 at the invasive front in some colorectal carcinomas is consistent with previous findings that an interaction between Plk2 and TSC1 / mTOR signaling molecules plays a role in tumor suppression. Plk2 protein expression is lost at the same stage in colorectal carcinogenesis as p53. The p53 dependence of Plk2 loss and tumor suppressor function in relationship to mTOR signaling may have therapeutic implications.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor gene TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. It encodes p53, a DNA-binding transcription factor that regulates multiple genes involved in DNA repair, metabolism, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence. TP53 is associated with human cancer by mutations that lead to a loss of wild-type p53 function as well as mutations that confer alternate oncogenic functions that enable them to promote invasion, metastasis, proliferation, and cell survival. Identifying the discrete TP53 mutations in tumor cells may help direct therapies that are more effective. In this study, we identified the frequency of individual TP53 mutations in patients with colon adenocarcinoma (48%), non\u2013small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) (36%), and glioma/glioblastoma (28%) at our institution using next-generation sequencing. We also identified the occurrence of somatic mutations in numerous actionable genes including BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, IDH1, and PIK3CA that occurred concurrently with these TP53 mutations. Of the 480 tumors examined that contained one or more mutations in the TP53 gene, 219 were colon adenocarcinomas, 215 were NSCLCs, and 46 were gliomas/glioblastomas. Among the patients positive for TP53 mutations diagnosed with colon adenocarcinoma, 50% also showed at least one mutation in pathogenic genes of which 14% were BRAF, 33% were KRAS, and 3% were NRAS. Forty-seven percent of NSCLC patients harboring TP53 mutations also had a mutation in at least one actionable pathogenic variant with the following frequencies: BRAF: 4%, EGFR: 10%, KRAS: 28%, and PIK3CA: 4%. Fifty-two percent of patients diagnosed with glioma/glioblastoma with a positive TP53 mutation had at least one concurrent mutation in a known pathogenic gene of which 9% were CDKN2A, 41% were IDH1, and 11% were PIK3CA.",

     "abstract": "Target-specific treatment modalities are currently not available for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and acquired chemotherapy resistance is a primary obstacle for the treatment of these tumors. Here we employed derivatives of BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 TNBC cell lines that were adapted to grow in the presence of either 5-Fluorouracil, Doxorubicin or Docetaxel in an aim to identify molecular pathways involved in the adaptation to drug-induced cell killing. All six drug-adapted BT-549 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines displayed cross resistance to chemotherapy and decreased apoptosis sensitivity. Expression of the anti-apoptotic co-chaperone BAG3 was notably enhanced in two thirds (4/6) of the six resistant lines simultaneously with higher expression of HSP70 in comparison to parental controls. Doxorubicin-resistant BT-549 (BT-549rDOX20) and 5-Fluorouracil-resistant MDA-MB-468 (MDA-MB-468r5-FU2000) cells were chosen for further analysis with the autophagy inhibitor Bafilomycin A1 and lentiviral depletion of ATG5, indicating that enhanced cytoprotective autophagy partially contributes to increased drug resistance and cell survival. Stable lentiviral BAG3 depletion was associated with a robust down-regulation of Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, restoration of drug-induced apoptosis and reduced cell adhesion in these cells, and these death-sensitizing effects could be mimicked with the BAG3/Hsp70 interaction inhibitor YM-1 and by KRIBB11, a selective transcriptional inhibitor of HSF-1. Furthermore, BAG3 depletion was able to revert the EMT-like transcriptional changes observed in BT-549rDOX20 and MDA-MB-468r5-FU2000 cells. In summary, genetic and pharmacological interference with BAG3 is capable to resensitize TNBC cells to treatment, underscoring its relevance for cell death resistance and as a target to overcome therapy resistance of breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have an established impact on the prognosis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), however, their role in recurrent ovarian cancer is largely unknown. We therefore systematically investigated TIL densities and MHC class I and II (MHC1, 2) expression in the progression of HGSOC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ TILs and MHC1, 2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays in 113 paired primary and recurrent HGSOC. TILs were quantified by image analysis. All patients had been included to the EU-funded OCTIPS FP7 project. RESULTS: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ TILs and MHC1 and MHC2 expression showed significant correlations between primary and recurrent tumor levels (Spearman rho 0.427, 0.533, 0.361, 0.456, 0.526 respectively; P<.0001 each). Paired testing revealed higher CD4+ densities and MHC1 expression in recurrent tumors (Wilcoxon P=.034 and P=.018). There was also a shift towards higher CD3+ TILs levels in recurrent carcinomas when analyzing platinum-sensitive tumors only (Wilcoxon P=.026) and in pairs with recurrent tumor tissue from first relapse only (Wilcoxon P=.031). High MHC2 expression was the only parameter to be significantly linked to prolonged progression-free survival after first relapse (PFS2, log-rank P=.012). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study that analyzed the development of TILs density and MHC expression in paired primary and recurrent HGSOC. The level of the antitumoral immune response in recurrent tumors was clearly dependent on the one in the primary tumor. Our data contribute to the understanding of temporal heterogeneity of HGSOC immune microenvironment and have implications for selection of samples for biomarker testing in the setting of immune-targeting therapeutics.",

We have previously reported that the cohesin SA-1 down-regulation is an early event in colon carcinogenesis which is dramatically accentuated in African-Americans. In order to investigate the mechanism, we evaluated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for association with SA-1-related outcomes followed by gene editing of candidate SNP. We observed that rs34149860 SNP was significantly associated with a lower colonic mucosal SA-1 expression and evaluation of public databases showed striking racial discordance. Given that the predicted SNP would alter miR-29b binding site, we used CRISPR knock-in in CRC cells and demonstrated that the SNP but not wild-type had profound alterations in SA-1 expression with miR-29b inhibitor. This is the first demonstration of high-order chromatin regulators as a modulator of racial differences, risk alteration with SNPs and finally specific modulation by microRNAs.",

The mechanism for this recurrence is yet unknown. Here we report that human mammary carcinoma cells induced to undergo apoptosis could recover with increased tumorigenicity in vitro and in vivo, and induced lymph node metastasis. Specifically, the reversed cells underwent epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions in the primary tumors in situ, and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transitions in the metastatic cells. Flow cytometry confirmed an elevated percentage of cells carrying cancer stem cells (CSCs) markers (CD44+/CD24-) in the reversed breast cancer cell population, with hypomethylated CD44 promoters and hypermethylated CD24 promoters. More importantly, CSCs were generated anew from non-stem cancer cells after apoptosis reversal possibly through epigenetic modifications. The results from this study can open doors to discovering more effective cancer treatments by suppressing apoptosis reversal.",

Understanding which symptoms are associated with longer diagnostic intervals to help the targeting of early diagnosis initiatives is an area of emerging research. In this Review, we consider the methodological challenges in studying the presenting symptoms and intervals to diagnosis of cancer patients, and summarize current evidence on presenting symptoms associated with a range of common and rarer cancer sites. We propose a taxonomy of cancer sites considering their symptom signature and the predictive value of common presenting symptoms. Finally, we consider evidence on associations between symptomatic presentations and intervals to diagnosis before discussing implications for the design, implementation, and evaluation of public health or health system interventions to achieve the earlier detection of cancer.",

In the present study, we explored the anti\u2013colorectal cancer (CRC) activity of SL-1, a DNA-directed N-mustard-quinoline conjugate. The N-mustard moiety in SL-1 induced DNA strand breaks, interstrand cross-links (ICLs), G2/M arrest, and apoptosis, whereas its quinoline moiety preferentially directed SL-1 to target the selective guanine sequence 5\u2032-G-G/C-N-G-C/T-3\u2032. Notably, SL-1 was highly cytotoxic to various CRC cell lines. Experiments using xenograft models revealed that SL-1 was more potent than 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin for suppressing the growth of RKO and RKO-E6 (oxaliplatin-resistant subline) cells as well as metastatic SW620 cells. In addition, SL-1 combined with 5-FU was more effective than oxaliplatin and 5-FU for suppressing RKO or SW620 cell growth in mice. Significantly, compared with cisplatin, oxaliplatin, or 5-FU, SL-1 alone or in combination with 5-FU did not cause obvious kidney or liver toxicity in ICR mice. In summary, SL-1, a DNA-directed alkylating agent, is established as an anti-CRC agent with high efficacy and low toxicity and thus warrants further development for the treatment of CRC patients.",

Here we investigated the silencing effects of two of the three known isoforms, HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1, on collagen 1 (Col1) fibers, which form a major component of the ECM of tumors. Using a loss-of-function approach for HIF-1\u03b1 or 2\u03b1 or both HIF-1\u03b1 and 2\u03b1, we identified a relationship between HIFs and Col1 fibers in MDA-MB-231 tumors. Tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 cells with HIF-1\u03b1 or 2\u03b1 or both HIF-1\u03b1 and 2\u03b1 silenced contained higher percent fiber volume and lower inter-fiber distance compared to tumors derived from empty vector MDA-MB-231 cells. Depending upon the type of silencing, we observed changes in Col1 degrading enzymes, and enzymes involved in Col1 synthesis and deposition. Additionally, a reduction in lysyl oxidase protein expression in HIF-down-regulated tumors suggests that more non-cross-linked fibers were present. Collectively these results identify the role of HIFs in modifying the ECM and the TME and provide new insights into the effects of hypoxia on the tumor ECM.",

We strove to uncover the proteome signature of primary PCa and associated lymph node metastases (LNMs) in order to identify proteins that may indicate or potentially promote metastases formation. We performed a proteomic comparative profiling of PCa tissue from radical prostatectomy (RPE) of patients without nodal metastases or relapse at the time of surgical resection (n\u00a0=\u00a05) to PCa tissue from RPE of patients who suffered from nodal relapse (n\u00a0=\u00a05). For the latter group, we also included patient-matched tissue of the nodal metastases. All samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. We identified and quantified more than 1200 proteins by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry with subsequent label-free quantification. An increase of ribosomal or proteasomal proteins in LNM (compared to corresponding PCa) became apparent, while extracellular matrix components rather decreased. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) corroborated accumulation of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase 1 and N-myc-downstream-regulated-gene 3, alpha/beta hydrolase domain-containing protein 11, and protein phosphatase slingshot homolog 3 in LNM. These findings strengthen the present interest in examining PARP inhibitors for the treatment of aggressive PCa. IHC also corroborated increased abundance of retinol dehydrogenase 11 in metastasized primary PCa compared to organ-confined PCa. Generally, metastasizing primary tumors were characterized by an enrichment of proteins involved in cellular lipid metabolic processes with concomitant decrease of cell adhesion proteins. This study highlights the usefulness of a combined proteomic-IHC approach to explore novel aspects in tumor biology. Our initial results open novel opportunities for follow-up studies.",

The effect of Usp9x activity inhibition by small molecule deubiquitinase inhibitor G9 was assessed in 2D and 3D culture, and its efficacy was tested in human tumor xenografts. Overexpression of Usp9x increased 3D growth and invasion in PANC1 cells and up-regulated the expression of known Usp9x substrates Mcl-1 and ITCH. Usp9x inhibition by shRNA-knockdown or by G9 treatment reduced 3D colony formation in PANC1 and PDX cell lines, induced rapid apoptosis in MIAPACA2 cells, and associated with reduced Mcl-1 and ITCH protein levels. Although G9 treatment reduced human MIAPACA2 tumor burden in vivo, in mouse pancreatic cancer cell lines established from constitutive (8041) and doxycycline-inducible (4668) KrasG12D/Tp53R172H mouse pancreatic tumors, Usp9x inhibition increased and sustained the 3D colony growth and showed no significant effect on tumor growth in 8041-xenografts.

In this study, we investigated the expression and oncogenic effect of NTSR3/sortilin in NETs.

Moreover, silencing of NTSR3/sortilin significantly suppressed cell adhesion and cell migration with inhibition of focal adhesion kinase and Src phosphorylation in the NET cells. Our results demonstrate increased expression of NTSR3/sortilin in NET patient tissues and a critical role of NTSR3/sortilin on NET cell adhesion and migration suggesting that NTSR3/sortilin contributes to NET tumorigenesis.",

However, the heparin-binding domain(s) pertinent to the angiogenic activity have yet been identified. YKL-40 harbors a consensus heparin-binding motif that consists of positively charged arginine (R) and lysine (K) (RRDK; residues 144\u2013147); but they don't bind to heparin. Intriguingly, we identified a separate KR-rich domain (residues 334\u2013345) that does display strong heparin binding affinity. A short synthetic peptide spanning this KR-rich domain successfully competed with YKL-40 and blocked its ability to bind heparin. Three individual point mutations, where alanine (A) substituted for K or R (K337A, K342A, R344A), led to remarkable decreases in heparin-binding ability and angiogenic activity. In addition, a neutralizing anti-YKL-40 antibody that targets these residues and prevents heparin binding impeded angiogenesis in vitro. MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells engineered to express ectopic K337A, K342A or R344A mutants displayed reduced tumor development and compromised tumor vessel formation in mice relative to control cells expressing wild-type YKL-40. These data reveal that the KR-rich heparin-binding motif is the functional heparin-binding domain of YKL-40.

Tumor-bearing mice (10/group) were administered 10 mg/kg lenvatinib (p.o.) or 40 mg/kg sorafenib (p.o.), alone or in combination with 25 mg/kg HNHA (i.p.) once every three days. Gene expression in patient-derived PTC and ATC cells was compared using a microarray approach. Cellular apoptosis and proliferation were examined by immunohistochemistry and MTT assays. Tumor volume and cell properties were examined in the mouse xenograft model. HNHA-lenvatinib combined treatment induced markers of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and suppressed anti-apoptosis markers, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and the FGFR signaling pathway. Combined treatment induced significant tumor shrinkage in the xenograft model. HNHA-lenvatinib combination treatment thus blocked the FGFR signaling pathway, which is important for EMT. Treatment with HNHA-lenvatinib combination was more effective than either agent alone or sorafenib-HNHA combination. These findings have implications for ATC treatment by preventing drug resistance in cancer stem cells.",

Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) acquire an abnormal enzymatic activity, resulting in the production of 2-hydroxyglutarate and alterations in cellular metabolism, histone modification, and DNA methylation. Mutant IDH1 has been identified in various human malignancies, and IDH1R132H constituted the vast majority of mutational events of IDH1. Most recent studies suggested that IDH1 mutations define a methylator subtype in PCa. However, the function of IDH1R132H in PCa development and progression is largely unknown. In this study, we showed that the prevalence of IDH1R132H in Chinese PCa patients is 0.6% (2/336). Of note, IDH1R132H-mutant PCa patients lacked other canonical genomic lesions (e.g., ERG rearrangement, PTEN deletion) that are common in most other PCa patients. The in vitro experiment suggested that IDH1R132H can promote proliferation of benign prostate epithelial cell RWPE-1 when under the situation of low cytokine. It could also promote migration capacity of RWPE-1 cells. Mechanistically, IDH1R132H was an important regulator of insulin-like growth factor 1receptor (IGF1R) by downregulating a set of microRNAs (miR-141-3p, miR-7-5p, miR-223-3p). These microRNAs were repressed by the alteration of epigenetic modification to decrease the enrichment of active marker H3K4me3 or to increase repressive marker H3K27me3 at their promoters. Collectively, we proposed a novel model for an IDH1R132H-microRNAs-IGF1R regulatory axis, which might provide insight into the function of IDH1R132H in PCa development.",

We simultaneously investigated CD3, PDL1, and IDO by immunohistochemistry in paired biopsies from various organs of 43 metastatic melanoma patients treated with IT and targeted therapy (TT). Intraindividual biopsies taken after a period of weeks to months demonstrate discordant results in 30% of the cases. Overlap of IDO and PDL1 increased after therapy. IT only marginally impacted PDL1 expression over time in contrast to TT. Standardized repeated assessments of multiple immune markers in repeated biopsies will generate detailed insights in melanoma's immune evolution and adaption during therapies and might be used to support treatment decisions.",

     "abstract": "As the leading cause of cancer-related mortality, lung cancer is a worldwide health issue that is overwhelmingly caused by smoking. However, a substantial minority (~25%) of patients with non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has never smoked. In these patients, activating mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are more likely, which render their tumors susceptible for a finite period to treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and confer a better prognosis than EGFR wild-type NSCLC. On progression, due to the inevitable insurgence of resistance, TKIs are generally followed by second- or third-line salvage chemotherapy until treatment failure, after which no standard treatment options are available, resulting in a poor prognosis and a high risk of death. With the focus of clinical attention on treatment with TKIs, few studies on optimal salvage therapies, including cytotoxic chemotherapy, after failure of EGFR TKIs have been reported. Despite a paucity of available data, the aim of this review is to summarize the \u201cno-man's land\u201d of TKI-failed EGFR-mutated NSCLC and expand on alternative strategies as well as potential future directions.",

Although GO shows a narrow therapeutic window in early clinical studies, recent reports detailing a modified dosing regimen of GO can be safely combined with induction chemotherapy, and the combination provides significant survival benefits in AML patients. Here we tested whether the survival benefits seen with the combination arise from the enhanced reduction of chemoresidual disease and leukemic initiating cells (LICs). Herein, we use cell line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) AML models to evaluate the combination of GO with daunorubicin and cytarabine (DA) induction chemotherapy on AML blast growth and animal survival. DA chemotherapy and GO as separate treatments reduced AML burden but left significant chemoresidual disease in multiple AML models. The combination of GO and DA chemotherapy eliminated nearly all AML burden and extended overall survival. In two small subsets of AML models, chemoresidual disease following DA chemotherapy displayed hallmark markers of leukemic LICs (CLL1 and CD34). In vivo, the two chemoresistant subpopulations (CLL1+/CD117\u2212 and CD34+/CD38+) showed higher ability to self-renewal than their counterpart subpopulations, respectively. CD33 was coexpressed in these functional LIC subpopulations. We demonstrate that the GO and DA induction chemotherapy combination more effectively eliminates LICs in AML PDX models than either single agent alone. These data suggest that the survival benefit seen by the combination of GO and induction chemotherapy, nonclinically and clinically, may be attributed to the enhanced reduction of LICs.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents at metastatic stage in over 50% of patients. With a survival rate of just 2.7% for patients presenting with distant disease, it is imperative to uncover novel mechanisms capable of suppressing metastasis in PDAC. Previously, we reported that the loss of metastasis suppressor protein 1 (MTSS1) in PDAC cells results in significant increase in cellular migration and invasion. Conversely, we also found that overexpressing MTSS1 in metastatic PDAC cell lines corresponds with not only decreased metastatic phenotype, but also greater overall survival. While it is known that MTSS1 is downregulated in late-stage PDAC, the mechanism behind that loss has not yet been elucidated. Here, we build off our previous findings to present a novel regulatory mechanism for the stabilization of MTSS1 via the tumor suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). We show that PTEN loss in PDAC cells results in a decrease in MTSS1 expression and increased metastatic potential. Additionally, we demonstrate that PTEN forms a complex with MTSS1 in order to stabilize and protect it from proteasomal degradation. Finally, we show that the inflammatory tumor microenvironment, which makes up over 90% of PDAC tumor bulk, is capable of downregulating PTEN expression through secretion of miRNA-23b, potentially uncovering a novel extrinsic mechanism of MTSS1 regulation. Collectively, these data offer new insight into the role and regulation of MTSS1in suppressing tumor cell invasion and migration and help shed light as to what molecular mechanisms could be leading to early cell dissemination in PDAC.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bone metastasis is common in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), and the lesions are mainly osteolytic. The mechanism of bone destruction in RCC bone metastasis is unknown. METHODS: We used a direct intrafemur injection of mice with bone-derived 786-O RCC cells (Bo-786) as an in vivo model to study if inhibition of osteoblast differentiation is involved in osteolytic bone lesions in RCC bone metastasis. RESULTS: We showed that bone-derived Bo-786 cells induced osteolytic bone lesions in the femur of mice. We examined the effect of conditioned medium of Bo-786 cells (Bo-786 CM) on both primary mouse osteoblasts and MC3T3-E1 preosteoblasts and found that Bo-786 CM inhibited osteoblast differentiation. Secretome analysis of Bo-786 CM revealed that BIGH3 (Beta ig h3 protein), also known as TGFBI (transforming growth factor beta-induced protein), is highly expressed. We generated recombinant BIGH3 and found that BIGH3 inhibited osteoblast differentiation in vitro. In addition, CM from Bo-786 BIGH3 knockdown cells (786-BIGH3 KD) reduced the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation compared to CM from vector control. Intrafemural injection of mice with 786-BIGH3 KD cells showed a reduction in osteolytic bone lesions compared to vector control. Immunohistochemical staining of 18 bone metastasis specimens from human RCC showed strong BIGH3 expression in 11/18 (61%) and moderate BIGH3 expression in 7/18 (39%) of the specimens. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that suppression of osteoblast differentiation by BIGH3 is one of the mechanisms that enhance osteolytic lesions in RCC bone metastasis, and raise the possibilty that treatments that increase bone formation may improve therapy outcomes.",

In myxoid and round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS), an adipocytic tumor characterized by the expression of the fusion oncogene FUS-CHOP, SRC have been found as one of the most activated kinases. Here we used a cell-of-origin model of MRCLS and an MRCLS cell line to thoroughly characterize the mechanisms of cell invasion induced by FUS-CHOP using in vitro (3D spheroid invasion assays) and in vivo (chicken chorioallantoic membrane model) approaches. FUS-CHOP expression activated SRC-FAK signaling and increased the invasive ability of MRCLS cells. In addition, FAK expression was found to significantly correlate with tumor aggressiveness in sarcoma patient samples. The involvement of SRC/FAK activation in FUS-CHOP\u2013mediated invasion was further confirmed using the SRC inhibitor dasatinib, the specific FAK inhibitor PF-573228, and FAK siRNA. Notably, dasatinib and PF573228 could also efficiently block the invasion of cancer stem cell subpopulations. Downstream of SRC/FAK signaling, we found that FUS-CHOP expression increases the levels of the RHO/ROCK downstream effector phospho-MLC2 (T18/S19) and that this activation was prevented by dasatinib or PF573228. Moreover, the ROCK inhibitor RKI-1447 was able to completely abolish invasion in FUS-CHOP\u2013expressing cells. These data uncover the involvement of SRC/FAK/RHO/ROCK signaling axis in FUS-CHOP\u2013mediated invasion, thus providing a rationale for testing inhibitors of this pathway as potential novel antimetastatic agents for MRCLS treatment.",

Previous microarray and Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-ChIP analyses have revealed that interferon-stimulated gene 20 kDa (ISG20), an exoribonuclease involved in the antiviral function of interferon, is up-regulated by T3 in HepG2-TR cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of ISG20 action in tumor progression remain unknown to date. Here, we verified induction of ISG20 mRNA and protein expression by T3 in HepG2-TR cells. Based on the ChIP-on-ChIP database, potential thyroid hormone responsive element of the ISG20 promoter region was predicted, and the result confirmed with the ChIP assay. Functional assays showed that forced expression of ISG20 leads to significant promotion of metastasis and angiogenesis, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, the angiogenic-related protein, interleukin-8 (IL-8), was up-regulated through a T3-mediated increase in ISG20, as determined using a human angiogenesis array kit. Induction of IL-8 signaling activated the p-JAK2/p-STAT3 pathway, in turn, leading to promotion of tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. Furthermore, ISG20 overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens was positively correlated with clinical parameters, including vascular invasion, \u03b1-fetoprotein and tumor size. Higher ISG20 expression was significantly correlated with poorer recurrence-free survival in HCC patients. Our results collectively indicate higher TR-dependent expression of ISG20 in a subset of HCC, supporting an oncogenic role in HCC progression.",

A synergistic relationship between rapamycin and cisplatin in uterine endometrial cancer (UEC) in vitro has been reported, but the mechanism and the combined therapeutic strategy for endometrial cancer (EC) are still unknown. We found a positive correlation between the level of IL-27 and the differentiated stage of UEC. The increase of IL-27 in uterine endometrial cancer cell (UECC) lines (Ishikawa, RL95-2 and KLE) led to a high cytotoxic activity of NK cells to UECC in the co-culture system. Exposure with rapamycin enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK cells by upregulating the expression of IL-27 in UECC and IL-27 receptors (IL-27Rs: WSX-1 and gp130) on NK cells and further restricted the growth of UEC in Ishikawa-xenografted nude mice. In addition, treatment with rapamycin resulted in an increased autophagy level of UECC, and IL-27 enhanced this ability of rapamycin. Cisplatin-mediated NK cells' cytotoxic activity and anti-UEC activation were independent of IL-27; however, the combination of rapamycin and cisplatin led to a higher cytotoxic activity of NK cells, smaller UEC volume and longer survival rate in vivo. These results suggest that rapamycin and cisplatin synergistically activate the cytotoxicity of NK cells and inhibit the progression of UEC in both an IL-27\u2013dependent and \u2013independent manner. This provides a scientific basis for potential rapamycin-cisplatin combined therapeutic strategies targeted to UEC, especially for the patients with low differentiated stage or abnormally low level of IL-27.",

Its promising safety profile and broad-spectrum efficacy in vitro have been confirmed in Phase I/II trials in several advanced malignancies. Binding and reporter assays have shown that ONC201 is a selective antagonist of the dopamine D2-like receptors, specifically, DRD2 and DRD3. We hypothesized that ONC201\u2019s interaction with DRD2 plays a role in ONC201\u2019s anticancer effects. Using cBioportal and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses, we confirmed that DRD2 is expressed in different cancer cell types in a cell type\u2013specific manner. On the other hand, DRD3 was generally not detectable. Overexpressing DRD2 in cells with low DRD2 levels increased ONC201-induced PARP cleavage, which was preceded and correlated with an increase in ONC201-induced CHOP mRNA expression. On the other hand, knocking out DRD2 using CRISPR/Cas9 in three cancer cell lines was not sufficient to abrogate ONC201\u2019s anticancer effects. Although ONC201\u2019s anticancer activity was not dependent on DRD2 expression in the cancer cell types tested, we assessed the cytotoxic potential of DRD2 blockade. Transient DRD2 knockdown in HCT116 cells activated the integrated stress response and reduced cell number. Pharmacological antagonism of DRD2 significantly reduced cell viability. Thus, we demonstrate in this study that disrupting dopamine receptor expression and activity can have cytotoxic effects that may at least be in part due to the activation of the integrated stress response. On the other hand, ONC201\u2019s anticancer activity goes beyond its ability to antagonize DRD2, potentially due to ONC201\u2019s ability to activate other pathways that are independent of DRD2. Nevertheless, blocking the dopamine D1-like receptor DRD5 via siRNA or the use of a pharmacological antagonist promoted ONC201-induced anticancer activity.",

We used the C57BL/KaLwRij mouse model of myeloma, lentiviral-mediated DNA barcoding of 5TGM1 myeloma cells, and next-generation sequencing to investigate the relative efficiency of plasma cell migration to, and growth within, the bone marrow. This approach revealed three major findings: firstly, establishment of metastasis within the bone marrow was extremely inefficient, with approximately 0.01% of circulating myeloma cells becoming resident long term in the bone marrow of each long bone; secondly, the individual cells of each metastasis exhibited marked differences in their proliferative fates, with the majority of final tumor burden within a bone being attributable to the progeny of between 1 and 8 cells; and, thirdly, the proliferative fate of individual clonal plasma cells differed at each bone marrow site in which the cells \u201clanded.\u201d These findings suggest that individual myeloma plasma cells are subjected to vastly different selection pressures within the bone marrow microenvironment, highlighting the importance of niche-driven factors, which determine the disease course and outcome.",

We here sought to select highly informative covariates in a multistep strategy based on consecutive Cox regression models, resulting in a risk score that integrates hazard ratios of prognostic variables. METHODS: A cohort of 695 neuroblastoma patients was divided into a discovery set (n\u00a0=\u00a075) for multigene predictor generation, a training set (n\u00a0=\u00a0411) for risk score development, and a validation set (n\u00a0=\u00a0209). Relevant prognostic variables were identified by stepwise multivariable L1-penalized least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression, followed by backward selection in multivariable Cox regression, and then integrated into a novel risk score. RESULTS: The variables stage, age, MYCN status, and two multigene predictors, NB-th24 and NB-th44, were selected as independent prognostic markers by LASSO Cox regression analysis. Following backward selection, only the multigene predictors were retained in the final model. Integration of these classifiers in a risk scoring system distinguished three patient subgroups that differed substantially in their outcome. The scoring system discriminated patients with diverging outcome in the validation cohort (5-year event-free survival, 84.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4 vs 63.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.5 vs 31.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.4; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and its prognostic value was validated by multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: We here propose a translational strategy for developing risk assessment systems based on hazard ratios of relevant prognostic variables.

Several studies have implicated the development of cancer stem cells as a possible mechanism for therapy resistance in HNSCC. Heat shock protein 90\u2019s (Hsp90\u2019s) molecular chaperone function is implicated in pathways of resistance in HNSCC. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the efficacy of novel C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors (KU711 and KU757) in targeting HNSCC cancer stem cells (CSCs). Treatment of HNSCC human cell lines MDA1986, UMSCC 22B, and UMSCC 22B cisplatin-resistant cells with the KU compounds indicated complete blockage of self-renewal for the resistant and parent cell lines starting from 20 \u03bcM KU711 and 1 \u03bcM KU757. Dose-dependent decrease in the cancer stem cell markers CD44, ALDH, and CD44/ALDH double-positive cells was observed for all cell lines after treatment with KU711 and KU757. When cells were treated with either drug, migration and invasion were downregulated greater than 90% even at the lowest concentrations of 20 \u03bcM KU711 and 1 \u03bcM KU757. Western blot showed >90% reduction in client protein \u201cstemness\u201d marker BMI-1 and mesenchymal marker vimentin, as well as increase in epithelial marker E-cadherin for both cell lines, indicating epithelial to mesenchymal transition quiescence. Several CSC-mediated miRNAs that play a critical role in HNSCC therapy resistance were also downregulated with KU treatment. In vivo, KU compounds were effective in decreasing tumor growth with no observed toxicity. Taken together, these results indicate that KU compounds are effective therapeutics for targeting HNSCC CSCs.",

     "abstract": "The Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator upregulating genes that promote cell growth and inhibit apoptosis. The main dysregulation of the Hippo pathway in tumors is due to YAP overexpression, promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition, cell transformation, and increased metastatic ability. Moreover, it has recently been shown that YAP plays a role in sustaining resistance to targeted therapies as well. In our work, we evaluated the role of YAP in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer. In EGFR-addicted lung cancer cell lines (HCC4006 and HCC827) rendered resistant to several EGFR inhibitors, we observed that resistance was associated to YAP activation. Indeed, YAP silencing impaired the maintenance of resistance, while YAP overexpression decreased the responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors in sensitive parental cells. In our models, we identified the AXL tyrosine kinase receptor as the main YAP downstream effector responsible for sustaining YAP-driven resistance: in fact, AXL expression was YAP dependent, and pharmacological or genetic AXL inhibition restored the sensitivity of resistant cells to the anti-EGFR drugs. Notably, YAP overactivation and AXL overexpression were identified in a lung cancer patient upon acquisition of resistance to EGFR TKIs, highlighting the clinical relevance of our in vitro results. The reported data demonstrate that YAP and its downstream target AXL play a crucial role in resistance to EGFR TKIs and suggest that a combined inhibition of EGFR and the YAP/AXL axis could be a good therapeutic option in selected NSCLC patients.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Ferroptosis is a recently discovered form of iron-dependent nonapoptotic cell death. It is characterized by loss of the activity of the lipid repair enzyme, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), and accumulation of lethal reactive lipid oxygen species. However, we still know relatively little about ferroptosis and its molecular mechanism in gastric cancer (GC) cells. Here, we demonstrate that erastin, a classic inducer of ferroptosis, induces this form of cell death in GC cells and that cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1) plays an important role in this process. METHODS: We performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, cell viability assay, reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay, glutathione assay, lipid peroxidation assay, RNAi and gene transfection, immunofluorescent staining, dual-luciferase reporter assay, transmission electron microscopy, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to study the regulation of ferroptosis in GC cells. Mouse xenograft assay was used to figure out the mechanism in vivo. RESULTS: Silencing CDO1 inhibited erastin-induced ferroptosis in GC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Suppression of CDO1 restored cellular GSH levels, prevented ROS generation, and reduced malondialdehyde, one of the end products of lipid peroxidation. In addition, silencing COO1 maintained mitochondrial morphologic stability in erastin-treated cells. Mechanistically, c-Myb transcriptionally regulated CDO1, and inhibition of CDO1 expression upregulated GPX4 expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings give a better understanding of ferroptosis and its molecular mechanism in GC cells, gaining insight into ferroptosis-mediated cancer treatment.",

The aim of the study was to analyze the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2, and osteopontin in vitro in two different tumor cell lines under hypoxia (pO2\u00a0\u2248\u00a01.5 mmHg) and/or acidosis (pH\u00a0=\u00a06.6) for up to 24 hours since hypoxia and acidosis are common characteristics of solid tumors. Additionally, the same tumor cell lines implanted in vivo were made hypoxic and acidotic artificially for 24 hours, after which the cytokine expression was measured. Finally, the activation of ERK1/2 and p38 by acidosis/hypoxia and their impact on cytokine expression were studied. The results indicate that acidosis and hypoxia have fundamentally different (often opposing) effects on cytokine expression. In addition, these effects were tumor cell line specific. When combining hypoxia and acidosis, the overall changes reflect an additive effect of both conditions alone, indicating that hypoxia and acidosis act by independent mechanisms. The in vivo changes corresponded well with the results obtained in the isolated tumor cells. Only iNOS expression was downregulated in vivo but increased in cell culture. For IL-6 expression, the acidosis-induced changes were dependent on ERK1/2 activation. In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the environmental pO2 and pH strongly affect the expression of inflammatory mediators in tumor cells. In vivo, most of the inflammatory mediators were downregulated, which could limit the activation of immune cells and by this foster the immune escape of tumors.",

MUC1 expression was studied in patient-derived bone metastasis and CRPCs produced by prostate-specific PTEN\u2212/\u2212 mice and LNCaP xenografts. Elevations in MUC1 expression occur in CRPC. Among nine patients with hormone-na\u00efve bone metastasis, eight express MUC1 in 61% to 100% of PC cells. Utilizing cBioPortal PC genomic data, we organized a training (n\u00a0=\u00a0300), testing (n\u00a0=\u00a0185), and validation (n\u00a0=\u00a0194) cohort. Using the Cox model, a nine-gene signature was derived, including eight genes from a MUC1-related network (APC, CTNNB1/\u03b2-catenin, GALNT10, GRB2, LYN, SIGLEC1, SOS1, and ZAP70) and FAM84B. Genomic alterations in these genes reduce disease-free survival (DFS) in the training (P\u00a0=\u00a0.00161), testing (P\u00a0=\u00a0.00699), entire (training\u00a0+\u00a0testing, P\u00a0=\u00a05.557e-5), and a validation cohort (P\u00a0=\u00a03.326e-5).

     "abstract": "Directional cell migration is of fundamental importance to a variety of biological events, including metastasis of malignant cells. Herein, we specifically investigated SET oncoprotein, a subunit of the recently identified inhibitor of acetyltransferases (INHAT) complex and identified its role in the establishment of front\u2013rear cell polarity and directional migration in Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma (ESCC). We further define the molecular circuits that govern these processes by showing that SET modulated DOCK7/RAC1 and cofilin signaling events. Moreover, a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution of RAC1 and cofilin allowed us to decipher the synergistical contributions of the two in coordinating the advancing dynamics by measuring architectures, polarities, and cytoskeletal organizations of the lamellipodia leading edges. In further investigations in vivo, we identified their unique role at multiple levels of the invasive cascade for SET cell and indicate the necessity for their functional balance to enable efficient invasion as well. Additionally, SET epigenetically repressed miR-30c expression by deacetylating histones H2B and H4 on its promoter, which was functionally important for the biological effects of SET in our cell-context. Finally, we corroborated our findings in vivo by evaluating the clinical relevance of SET signaling in the metastatic burden in mice and a large series of patients with ESCC at diagnosis, observing it's significance in predicting metastasis formation. Our findings uncovered a novel signaling network initiated by SET that epigenetically modulated ESCC properties and suggest that targeting the regulatory axis might be a promising strategy to inhibit migration and metastasis.",

We previously discovered that deletion of a Notch signaling modulator, Lunatic Fringe (Lfng), in the mouse mammary gland induced a subset of tumors resembling CLBC. Here we report that deletion of one copy of p53 on this background not only accelerated mammary tumor development but also led to a complete penetrance of the mesenchymal stem-like phenotype. All mammary tumors examined in the Lfng/p53 compound mutant mice displayed a mesenchymal/spindloid pathology. These tumors showed high level expressions of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers including Vimentin, Twist, and PDGFR\u03b1, a gene known to be enriched in CLBC. Prior to tumor onset, Lfng/p53 mutant mammary glands exhibited increased levels of Vimentin and E-cadherin, but decreased expressions of cytokeratin 14 and cytokeratin 8, accompanied by elevated basal cell proliferation and an expanded mammary stem cell-enriched population. Lfng/p53 mutant glands displayed increased accumulation of Notch3 intracellular fragment, up-regulation of Hes5 and down-regulation of Hes1. Analysis in human breast cancer datasets found the lowest HES1 and second lowest LFNG expressions in CLBC among molecular subtypes, and low level of LFNG is associated with poor survival. Immunostaining of human breast cancer tissue array found correlation between survival and LFNG immunoreactivity. Finally, patients carrying TP53 mutations express lower LFNG than patients with wild type TP53. Taken together, these data revealed genetic interaction between Lfng and p53 in mammary tumorigenesis, established a new mouse model resembling CLBC, and may suggest targeting strategy for this disease.",

     "abstract": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapies predominantly affect nascent, immature tumor vessels. Since platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) blockade inhibits vessel maturation and thus increases the amount of immature tumor vessels, we evaluated whether the combined PDGFR inhibition by nilotinib and VEGFR2 blockade by DC101 has synergistic therapy effects in a desmoplastic breast cancer xenograft model. In this context, besides immunohistological evaluation, molecular ultrasound imaging with BR55, the clinically used VEGFR2-targeted microbubbles, was applied to monitor VEGFR2-positive vessels noninvasively and to assess the therapy effects on tumor angiogenesis. DC101 treatment alone inhibited tumor angiogenesis, resulting in lower tumor growth and in significantly lower vessel density than in the control group after 14 days of therapy. In contrast, nilotinib inhibited vessel maturation but enhanced VEGFR2 expression, leading to markedly increased tumor volumes and a significantly higher vessel density. The combination of both drugs led to an almost similar tumor growth as in the DC101 treatment group, but VEGFR2 expression and microvessel density were higher and comparable to the controls. Further analyses revealed significantly higher levels of tumor cell\u2013derived VEGF in nilotinib-treated tumors. In line with this, nilotinib, especially in low doses, induced an upregulation of VEGF and IL-6 mRNA in the tumor cells in vitro, thus providing an explanation for the enhanced angiogenesis observed in nilotinib-treated tumors in vivo. These findings suggest that nilotinib inhibits vessel maturation but counteracts the effects of antiangiogenic co-therapy by enhancing VEGF expression by the tumor cells and stimulating tumor angiogenesis.",

In this study, we found that ZBTB7A is increased in cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma cells and that elevated ZBTB7A inhibits cisplatin-induced apoptosis by repressing LINC00473 expression. Further mechanistic studies revealed that ZBTB7A directly binds to the promoter and suppresses the transcription of LINC00473. Additionally, our data indicate that LINC00473 interacts with the transcript factor C/EBP\u03b2, facilitating its binding to the promoter of IL24, leading to decrease chemoresistance.

U-CH1 cells expressed brachyury, YAP, and laminin adhesion receptors (CD49c, CD49f, CD44), and approximately 15% to 20% of U-CH1 cells featured an \u03b16 integrin-dependent (CD49f) cohesive cluster phenotype, which confers therapeutic resistance and aids metastasis. DDR to IR in U-CH1 cells was compared to normal prostate epithelial (PrEC) and tumor cells (DU145). Flow cytometry showed a dose- and time-dependent increase in \u03b3H2AX and pKAP1 expression in all cell lines. However, nearly 50% of U-CH1 cells exhibited nonresponsive phenotype to IR (measured by \u03b3H2AX and pKAP1) independent of cell cycle status. Immunofluorescence microscopy verified that only 15% of U-CH1 clustered cells were \u03b3H2AX or pKAP1 positive (versus 80% of nonclustered cells) 2 hours following 2-Gy IR. Conversely, both tumor cell lines were uniformly defective in pATM response. HYD1, a synthetic ECM ligand, inhibited DDR through an unresolved \u03b3H2AX response. \u03b21 integrin-blocking antibody (AIIB2) decreased cell survival 50% itself and approximately doubled the IR-induced cell kill at all IR doses observed at 2 and 4 weeks posttreatment.

They are small vesicles known to carry a concentrated group of functional cargo and serve as intercellular communicators not only locally but also systemically. Increasingly, it is reported that extracellular vesicles facilitate the development of drug resistance in cancer; however, their role in BRAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma is unclear. Here we investigated if extracellular vesicles from BRAF inhibitor\u2013resistant melanoma could influence drug sensitivity in recipient melanoma cells. We demonstrate that the resistance driver, PDGFR\u03b2, can be transferred to recipient melanoma cells via extracellular vesicles, resulting in a dose-dependent activation of PI3K/AKT signaling and escape from MAPK pathway BRAF inhibition.

EVs were identified using PKH-67 staining. Morphologic changes, Ki-67 immunochemistry, cell viability, growth rates, and expression levels of miR-25 and miR-210, as well as of their target mRNAs, were determined in gastroids co-cultured with EAC-derived extracellular vesicles (c-EVs). C-EVs were efficiently taken up by gastroids. Notably, c-EV\u2013treated gastroids were more crowded, compact, and multilayered and contained smaller lumens than did those cultured in organoid medium alone or in EAC-conditioned medium that had been depleted of EVs. Moreover, c-EV\u2013treated gastroids manifested increased proliferation and cellular viability relative to medium-only or EV-depleted controls. Expression levels of miR-25 and miR-210 were significantly higher, and those of PTEN and AIFM3 significantly lower, in c-EV\u2013treated versus medium-only or EV-depleted control groups.

     "abstract": "The effect of anti-angiogenic agents on tumor oxygenation has been in question for a number of years, where both increases and decreases in tumor pO2 have been observed. This dichotomy in results may be explained by the role of vessel normalization in the response of tumors to anti-angiogenic therapy, where anti-angiogenic therapies may initially improve both the structure and the function of tumor vessels, but more sustained or potent anti-angiogenic treatments will produce an anti-vascular response, producing a more hypoxic environment. The first goal of this study was to employ multispectral (MS) 19F\u2013MRI to noninvasively quantify viable tumor pO2 and evaluate the ability of a high dose of an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to produce a strong and prolonged anti-vascular response that results in significant tumor hypoxia. The second goal of this study was to target the anti-VEGF induced hypoxic tumor micro-environment with an agent, tirapazamine (TPZ), which has been designed to target hypoxic regions of tumors. These goals have been successfully met, where an antibody that blocks both murine and human VEGF-A (B20.4.1.1) was found by MS 19F\u2013MRI to produce a strong anti-vascular response and reduce viable tumor pO2 in an HM-7 xenograft model. TPZ was then employed to target the anti-VEGF-induced hypoxic region. The combination of anti-VEGF and TPZ strongly suppressed HM-7 tumor growth and was superior to control and both monotherapies. This study provides evidence that clinical trials combining anti-vascular agents with hypoxia-activated prodrugs should be considered to improved efficacy in cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "Toxicity and resistance remain major challenges for advanced or recurrent cervical cancer therapies, as treatment requires high doses of chemotherapeutic agents. Restoration of TP53 and hypophosphorylated-retinoblastoma (pRB) proteins by human papillomavirus (HPV) E6/E7 siRNA sensitizes HPV-positive cervical cancer cells toward chemotherapeutic agents. Here, we investigated the therapeutic effects of E6/E7 siRNA on the dynamic behavior of TP53 and RB/E2F signaling networks in deciding the cell fate. The synergistic effect of HPV E6/E7 siRNA pool (SP) with chemotherapeutic agents on TP53 and RB/E2F signaling, proliferation, and apoptosis was analyzed in vitro and in vivo. Compared to the E6/E7 SP alone, E6/E7 SP with cisplatin treatment effectively restored TP53 and RB/E2F signaling and contributes to differences in cell fate, such as apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. We also developed a cellular dynamics model that includes TP53-RB/E2F dynamics and cell proliferation profiles, and confirmed its utility for investigating E6/E7 siRNA-based combination regimens. Using a dual reporter system, we further confirmed the cross talk between TP53 and RB/E2F signaling mechanisms. Treatment of E6/E7 SP cationic liposome (i.v.) with cisplatin and paclitaxel (i.p.) potentially inhibited tumor growth in BALB/c-nude mice. Altogether, our findings suggest that stabilization of TP53 and the RB/E2F repressor complex by E6/E7 SP combined with low-dose chemotherapy can effectively suppress tumor growth.",

     "abstract": "B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) cells are distinctively vulnerable to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Recently, inhibition of p97 was shown to induce ER stress and subsequently cell death in solid tumors and in multiple myeloma. We investigated the role of a novel, orally available, p97 inhibitor (CB-5083; Cleave Biosciences) in B-ALL. CB-5083 induced a significant reduction in viability in 10 human B-ALL cell lines, harboring the most common fusion-genes involved in pediatric and adult B-ALL, with IC50s ranging from 0.34 to 0.76 \u03bcM. Moreover, CB-5083 significantly reduced the colony formation of OP1 and NALM6 cells. Early and strong induction of apoptosis was demonstrated in BALL1 and OP1 cells, together with a robust cleavage of PARP. CB-5083 induced ER stress, as documented through: 1) prominent expression of chaperones (GRP78, GRP94, PDI, DNAJC3, and DNAJB9); 2) increased activation of IRE1-alpha, as demonstrated by the splicing of XBP1; and 3) activation of PERK, which resulted in a significant overexpression of CHOP, and its downstream genes. CB-5083 reduced the viability also in GRP78\u2212/\u2212, GRP94\u2212/\u2212, and XBP1\u2212/\u2212 cells, suggesting that none of these proteins alone was strictly required for CB-5083 activity. Moreover, we showed that the absence of XBP1 (XBP1\u2212/\u2212) increased the sensitivity to CB-5083, leading to the hypothesis that XBP1 splicing counteracts the activity of CB-5083, probably mitigating ER stress. Finally, vincristine was synergistic with CB-5083 in both BALL1 and OP1 cells. In summary, the targeting of p97 with CB-5083 is a novel promising therapeutic approach that should be further evaluated in B-ALL.",

In short-term cultures, supporting stromal cells provide a survival advantage to CLL cells by inducing transcription and translation without promoting proliferation. We hypothesized that the stromal microenvironment augments malignant B cells' metabolism to enable the cells to cope with their energy demands for transcription and translation. We used extracellular flux analysis to assess the two major energy-generating pathways, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and glycolysis, in primary CLL cells in the presence of three different stromal cell lines. OxPhos, measured as the basal oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and maximum respiration capacity, was significantly higher in 28 patients' CLL cells cocultured with bone marrow\u2013derived NK.Tert stromal cells than in CLL cells cultured alone (P = .004 and <.0001, respectively). Similar OCR induction was observed in CLL cells cocultured with M2-10B4 and HS-5 stromal lines. In contrast, heterogeneous changes in the extracellular acidification rate (a measure of glycolysis) were observed in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis of CLL cells' metabolomics profile indicated stroma-mediated stimulation of nucleotide synthesis. Quantitation of ribonucleotide pools showed a significant two-fold increase in CLL cells cocultured with stromal cells, indicating that the stroma may induce CLL cellular bioenergy and the RNA building blocks necessary for the transcriptional requirement of a prosurvival phenotype. The stroma did not impact the proliferation index (Ki-67 staining) of CLL cells. Collectively, these data suggest that short-term interaction (\u226424 hours) with stroma increases OxPhos and bioenergy in replicationally quiescent CLL cells.",

     "abstract": "In multiple myeloma, despite recent improvements offered by new therapies, disease relapse and drug resistance still occur in the majority of patients. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new drugs that can overcome drug resistance and prolong patient survival after failure of standard therapies. The imipridone ONC201 causes downstream inactivation of ERK1/2 signaling and has tumoricidal activity against a variety of tumor types, while its efficacy in preclinical models of myeloma remains unclear. In this study, we treated human myeloma cell lines and patient-derived tumor cells with ONC201. Treatment decreased cellular viability and induced apoptosis in myeloma cell lines, with IC50 values of 1 to 1.5 \u03bcM, even in those with high risk features or TP53 loss. ONC201 increased levels of the pro-apoptotic protein Bim in myeloma cells, resulting from decreased phosphorylation of degradation-promoting Bim Ser69 by ERK1/2. In addition, myeloma cell lines made resistant to several standard-of-care agents (by chronic exposure) were equally sensitive to ONC201 as their drug-na\u00efve counterparts, and combinations of ONC201 with proteasome inhibitors had synergistic anti-myeloma activity. Overall, these findings demonstrate that ONC201 kills myeloma cells regardless of resistance to standard-of-care therapies, making it promising for clinical testing in relapsed/refractory myeloma.",

     "abstract": "Although mice models rank among the most widely used tools for understanding human genetics, biology, and diseases, differences between orthologous genes among species as close as mammals are possible, particularly in orthologous gene pairs in which one or more paralogous (i.e., duplicated) genes appear in the genomes of the species. Duplicated genes can possess overlapping functions and compensate for each other. The retinoblastoma gene family demonstrates typical composite functionality in its three member genes (i.e., RB1, RB2/P130, and P107), all of which participate in controlling the cell cycle and associated phenomena, including proliferation, quiescence, apoptosis, senescence, and cell differentiation. We analyzed the role of the retinoblastoma gene family in regulating senescence in mice and humans. Silencing experiments with each member of the gene family in mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and fibroblasts from mouse and human tissues demonstrated that RB1 may be indispensable for senescence in mouse cells, but not in human ones, as an example of species specificity. Furthermore, although RB2/P130 seems to be implicated in maintaining human cell senescence, the function of RB1 within any given species might differ by cell type, as an example of cell specificity. For instance, silencing RB1 in mouse fibroblasts induced a reduced senescence not observed in mouse MSCs. Our findings could be useful as a general paradigm of cautions to take when inferring the role of human genes analyzed in animal studies and when examining the role of the retinoblastoma gene family in detail.",

Herein we present that in the presence of tamoxifen, FGFs (Fibroblast Growth Factors) promote BCa cell growth with the strongest effect being produced by FGF7. FGFR2 was identified as a mediator of FGF7 action and the FGFR2-induced signaling was found to underlie cancer-associated fibroblasts-dependent resistance to tamoxifen. FGF7/FGFR2-triggered pathway was shown to induce ER phosphorylation, ubiquitination and subsequent ER proteasomal degradation which counteracted tamoxifen-promoted ER stabilization. We also identified activation of PI3K/AKT signaling targeting ER-Ser167 and regulation of Bcl-2 expression as a mediator of FGFR2-promoted resistance to tamoxifen. Analysis of tissue samples from patients with invasive ductal carcinoma revealed an inversed correlation between expression of FGFR2 and ER, thus supporting our in vitro data. These results unveil the complexity of ER regulation by FGFR2-mediated signaling likely to be associated with BCa resistance to endocrine therapy.",

CCSP-2 expression was evaluated in human colon adenoma and colorectal specimens. Anti\u2013CCSP-2 antibody was labeled with a near-infrared fluorescent dye, FPR-675, and molecular imaging of surgical human colorectal tumors was performed. Immunohistochemistry identified CCSP-2 expression in 87.0% of colorectal cancer specimens and 89.5% of colon adenoma specimens. Fluorescence imaging of surgical human colon specimens after spraying treatment with the probe permitted a clear distinction of cancer from paired normal colon tissue (target-to-background ratio, 4.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001).

Here we report a novel \u201concogenic\u201d role of XPO5 in advanced prostate cancer. Using prostate cancer models, we found that excess levels of XPO5 override the inhibitory effect of the canoncial miRNA-mRNA regulation, resulting in a global increase in proteins expression. Importantly, we found that decreased expression of XPO5 could promote an increase in proteasome degradation, whereas overexpression of XPO5 leads to altered protein posttranslational modification via hyperglycosylation, resulting in cellular protein stability. We evaluated the therapeutic advantage of targeting XPO5 in prostate cancer and found that knocking down XPO5 in prostate cancer cells suppressed cellular proliferation and tumor development without significantly impacting normal fibroblast cells survival. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the oncogenic role of XPO5 in overriding the miRNAs regulation control. Furthermore, we believe that these findings will provide an explanation as to why, in some cancers that express higher abundance of mature miRNAs, fail to suppress their potential protein targets.",

Here we newly demonstrate the ability of one of the most specific Chk1 inhibitors, SCH900776 (MK-8776), to enhance human colon cancer cell sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of platinum(II) cisplatin and platinum(IV)- LA-12 complexes. The combined treatment with SCH900776 and cisplatin or LA-12 results in apparent increase in G1/S phase\u2013related apoptosis, stimulation of mitotic slippage, and senescence of HCT116 cells. We further show that the cancer cell response to the drug combinations is significantly affected by the p21, p53, and PTEN status. In contrast to their wt counterparts, the p53- or p21-deficient cells treated with SCH900776 and cisplatin or LA-12 enter mitosis and become polyploid, and the senescence phenotype is strongly suppressed. While the cell death induced by SCH900776 and cisplatin or LA-12 is significantly delayed in the absence of p53, the anticancer action of the drug combinations is significantly accelerated in p21-deficient cells, which is associated with stimulation of apoptosis beyond G2/M cell cycle phase. We also show that cooperative killing action of the drug combinations in HCT116 cells is facilitated in the absence of PTEN.

In preclinical studies, specific gut microbiota promotes regression of melanoma in mice.

IMGN529 has shown promising preclinical and clinical activity in non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, DLBCL is often treated with combination therapies to maximize clinical outcomes; therefore, we investigated the potential of combining IMGN529 with both standard-of-care and emerging therapies against multiple oncology-relevant targets and pathways. The strongest enhancement in potency was seen with anti-CD20 antibodies, including rituximab. The combination of IMGN529 and rituximab was more potent than either agent alone, and this combinatorial benefit was associated with increased apoptotic induction and cell death. Additional studies revealed that rituximab treatment increased the internalization and degradation of the CD37-targeting antibody moiety of IMGN529. The combination of IMGN529 and rituximab was highly efficacious in multiple xenograft models, with superior antitumor efficacy seen compared to either agent alone or treatment with R-CHOP therapy. These findings suggest a novel mechanism whereby the potency of IMGN529 can be enhanced by CD20 binding, which results in the increased internalization and degradation of IMGN529 leading to the generation of greater amounts of cytotoxic catabolite. Overall, these data provide a biological rationale for the enhanced activity of IMGN529 in combination with rituximab and support the ongoing clinical evaluation of IMGN529 in combination with rituximab in patients with relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since invasive bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most lethal urological malignant tumors worldwide, understanding the molecular mechanisms that trigger the migration, invasion, and metastasis of BC has great significance in reducing the mortality of this disease. Although RelA/p65, a member of the NF-kappa B transcription factor family, has been reported to be upregulated in human BCs, its regulation of BC motility and mechanisms have not been explored yet. METHODS: NF-\u03baBp65 expression was evaluated in N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)-nitrosamine (BBN)\u2013induced high invasive BCs by immunohistochemistry staining and in human BC cell lines demonstrated by Western Blot. The effects of NF-\u03baBp65 knockdown on BC cell migration and invasion, as well as its regulated RhoGDI\u03b1 and FBW7, were also evaluated in T24T cells by using loss- and gain-function approaches. Moreover, the interaction of FBW7 with RhoGDI\u03b1 was determined with immunoprecipitation assay, while critical role of ubiquitination of RhoGDI\u03b1 by FBW7 was also demonstrated in the studies. RESULTS: p65 protein was remarkably upregulated in the BBN-induced high invasive BCs and in human BC cell lines. We also observed that p65 overexpression promoted BC cell migration by inhibiting RhoGDI\u03b1 expression. The regulatory effect of p65 on RhoGDI\u03b1 expression is mediated by its upregulation of FBW7, which specifically interacted with RhoGDI\u03b1 and promoted RhoGDI\u03b1 ubiquitination and degradation. Mechanistic studies revealed that p65 stabilizing the E3 ligase FBW7 protein was mediated by its attenuating pten mRNA transcription. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that p65 overexpression inhibits pten mRNA transcription, which stabilizes the protein expression of ubiquitin E3 ligase FBW7, in turn increasing the ubiquitination and degradation of RhoGDI\u03b1 protein and finally promoting human BC migration. The novel identification of p65/PTEN/FBW7/RhoGDI\u03b1 axis provides a significant insight into understanding the nature of BC migration, further offering a new theoretical support for cancer therapy.",

Therapeutic strategies to target brain malignancies, both primary brain tumors, particularly in pediatric patients, and metastases, are lacking, but targeting angiogenesis may be a promising approach. Multiparametric MRI was used to investigate the response of orthotopic SF188luc pediatric glioblastoma xenografts to small molecule pan-VEGFR inhibitor cediranib and the effects of both cediranib and cross-reactive human/mouse anti-VEGF-A antibody B20-4.1.1 in intracranial MDA-MB-231 LM2\u20134 breast cancer xenografts over 48 hours. All therapeutic regimens resulted in significant tumor growth delay. In cediranib-treated SF188luc tumors, this was associated with lower Ktrans (compound biomarker of perfusion and vascular permeability) than in vehicle-treated controls. Cediranib also induced significant reductions in both Ktrans and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in MDA-MB-231 LM2\u20134 tumors associated with decreased histologically assessed perfusion. B20-4.1.1 treatment resulted in decreased Ktrans, but in the absence of a change in perfusion; a non-significant reduction in vascular permeability, assessed by Evans blue extravasation, was observed in treated tumors. The imaging responses of intracranial MDA-MB-231 LM2\u20134 tumors to VEGF/VEGFR pathway inhibitors with differing mechanisms of action are subtly different. We show that VEGF pathway blockade resulted in tumor growth retardation and inhibition of tumor vasculature in preclinical models of pediatric glioblastoma and breast cancer brain metastases, suggesting that multiparametric MRI can provide a powerful adjunct to accelerate the development of antiangiogenic therapies for use in these patient populations.",

     "abstract": "Improving the congruity of preclinical models with cancer as it is manifested in humans is a potential way to mitigate the high attrition rate of new cancer therapies in the clinic. In this regard, three-dimensional (3D) tumor cultures in vitro have recently regained interest as they have been acclaimed to have higher similarity to tumors in vivo than to cells grown in monolayers (2D). To identify cancer functions that are active in 3D rather than in 2D cultures, we compared the transcriptional profiles (TPs) of two non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines, NCI-H1650 and EBC-1 grown in both conditions to the TP of xenografted tumors. Because confluence, diameter or volume can hypothetically alter TPs, we made intra- and inter-culture comparisons using samples with defined dimensions. As projected by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), a limited number of signal transduction pathways operational in vivo were better represented by 3D than by 2D cultures in vitro. Growth of 2D and 3D cultures as well as xenografts induced major changes in the TPs of these 3 modes of culturing. Alterations of transcriptional network activation that were predicted to evolve similarly during progression of 3D cultures and xenografts involved the following functions: hypoxia, proliferation, cell cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, and interleukin activation. Direct comparison of TPs of 3D cultures and xenografts to monolayer cultures yielded up-regulation of networks involved in hypoxia, TGF and Wnt signaling as well as regulation of epithelial mesenchymal transition. Differences in TP of 2D and 3D cancer cell cultures are subject to progression of the cultures. The emulation of the predicted cell functions in vivo is therefore not only determined by the type of culture in vitro but also by the confluence or diameter of the 2D or 3D cultures, respectively. Consequently, the successful implementation of 3D models will require phenotypic characterization to verify the relevance of applying these models for drug development.",

To understand the impact of BGN on prognosis and its relationship to molecularly defined subsets, we analyzed BGN expression by immunohistochemistry on a tissue microarray containing 12,427 prostate cancers. Seventy-eight percent of 11,050 interpretable cancers showed BGN expression, which was considered as low intensity in 47.7% and as high intensity in 31.1% of cancers. BGN protein expression rose with increasing pathological tumor stage, Gleason grade, lymph node metastasis and early PSA recurrence (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001 each). Comparison with our molecular database attached to the TMA revealed that BGN expression was linked to presence of TMPRRS2:ERG fusion and PTEN deletion (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001 each). In addition, BGN was strongly linked to androgen-receptor (AR) levels (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), suggesting a hormone-depending regulation of BGN. BGN up-regulation is a frequent feature of prostate cancer that parallels tumor progression and may be useful to estimate tumor aggressiveness particularly if combined with other molecular markers.",

JAA-F11 has potential, when humanized, for cancer immunotherapy for multiple cancer types. Humanization of JAA-F11, was performed utilizing complementarity determining regions grafting on a homology framework. The objective herein is to test the specificity, affinity and biology efficacy of the humanized JAA-F11 (hJAA-F11). Using a 609 target glycan array, 2 hJAA-F11 constructs were shown to have excellent chemical specificity, binding only to TF-Ag alpha-linked structures and not to TF-Ag beta-linked structures. The relative affinity of these hJAA-F11 constructs for TF-Ag was improved over the mouse antibody, while T20 scoring predicted low clinical immunogenicity. The hJAA-F11 constructs produced antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in breast and lung tumor lines shown to express TF-Ag by flow cytometry. Internalization of hJAA-F11 into cancer cells was also shown using a surface binding ELISA and confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Both the naked hJAA-F11 and a maytansine-conjugated antibody (hJAA-F11-DM1) suppressed in vivo tumor progression in a human breast cancer xenograft model in SCID mice. Together, our results support the conclusion that the humanized antibody to the TF-Ag has potential as an adjunct therapy, either directly or as part of an antibody drug conjugate, to treat breast cancer, including triple negative breast cancer which currently has no targeted therapy, as well as lung cancer.",

Increased IL-4 expression in human colorectal cancer tissue and growth of colon cancer cell lines implied that IL-4\u2013induced Stat6-mediated tumorigenic signaling likely contributes to intestinal tumor progression in ApcMin/+ mice. Stat6 also appears to promote expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) cells. MDSCs promote polyp formation in the ApcMin/+ model. Hence, Stat6 could have a broad role in coordinating both polyp cell proliferation and MDSC expansion. We found that IL-4\u2013induced Stat6-mediated proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells is augmented by platelet-derived growth factor\u2013BB, a tumor-promoting growth factor. To determine whether polyp progression in ApcMin/+ mice is dependent on Stat6 signaling, we disrupted Stat6 in this model. Total polyps in the small intestine were fewer in ApcMin/+ mice lacking Stat6. Furthermore, proliferation of polyp epithelial cells was reduced, indicating that Stat6 in part controlled polyp formation. Stat6 also promoted expansion of MDSCs in the spleen and lamina propria of ApcMin/+ mice, implying regulation of antitumor T-cell response. More CD8 cells and reduced PD-1 expression on CD4 cells correlated with reduced polyps. In addition, a strong CD8-mediated cytotoxic response led to killing of tumor cells in Stat6-deficient ApcMin/+ mice. Therefore, these findings show that Stat6 has an oncogenic role in intestinal tumorigenesis by promoting polyp cell proliferation and immunosuppressive mediators, and preventing an active cytotoxic process.",

Whsc1 is also found mutated in a subgroup of B-cell derived malignant diseases by genomic translocation or point mutation, both of which resulted in hyperactivity of WHSC1 mediated H3K36 methylation and uncontrolled cell proliferation, suggesting that whsc1 functions as an oncogene. However, here we provided evidences to show that whsc1 also has tumor suppressor functions. We used zebrafish as an in vivo model and generated homozygous whsc1 mutant lines via clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated protein Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9) technology. Then western-blot (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF) were performed to analysis the expression level of H3K36Me2 and H3K36Me3, and we identified the diseased tissue via hematoxylin\u2013eosin (HE) staining, IF staining or immunohistochemistry (IHC). Whsc1 lose-of-function led to significant decrease in di- and tri-methylation of H3K36. A series of WHS related phenotypes were found in whsc1\u2212/\u2212 zebrafish, including growth retardation, neural development defects and heart failure. In addition, loss of function of whsc1 led to defects in the development of swim bladder, possibly through the dis-regulation of key genes in swim bladder organogenesis and inhibition of progenitor cell differentiation, which was correlated with its expression in this organ during embryonic development. At later stage, these whsc1\u2212/\u2212 zebrafishes are inclined to grow tumors in the swim bladder. Our work suggested that whsc1 may function as a tumor suppressor by governing progenitor cell differentiation.",

The magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) detected total choline (tCho) signal can serve as an early noninvasive imaging biomarker of chemotherapy response in breast cancer. We have quantified the individual components of the tCho signal, glycerophosphocholine (GPC), phosphocholine (PC) and free choline (Cho), before and after treatment with the commonly used chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin in weakly metastatic human MCF7 and triple-negative human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. While the tCho concentration did not change following doxorubicin treatment, GPC significantly increased and PC decreased. Of the two phosphatidylcholine-specific PLD enzymes, only PLD1, but not PLD2, mRNA was down-regulated by doxorubicin treatment. For the two reported genes encoding GPC phosphodiesterase, the mRNA of GDPD6, but not GDPD5, decreased following doxorubicin treatment. mRNA levels of choline kinase \u03b1 (ChK\u03b1), which converts Cho to PC, were reduced following doxorubicin treatment. PLD1 and ChK\u03b1 protein levels decreased following doxorubicin treatment in a concentration dependent manner. Treatment with the PLD1 specific inhibitor VU0155069 sensitized MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. Low concentrations of 100 nM of doxorubicin increased MDA-MB-231 cell migration. GDPD6, but not PLD1 or ChK\u03b1, silencing by siRNA abolished doxorubicin-induced breast cancer cell migration. Doxorubicin induced GPC increase and PC decrease are caused by reductions in PLD1, GDPD6, and ChK\u03b1 mRNA and protein expression. We have shown that silencing or inhibiting these genes/proteins can promote drug effectiveness and reduce adverse drug effects.

However, the unintended formation of human lymphoma in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice from Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)\u2013infected human lymphocytes can be problematic. In this study, we have characterized ovarian cancer PDXs which developed human lymphomas and explore methods to suppress lymphoproliferative growth. Fresh human ovarian tumors from 568 patients were transplanted intraperitoneally in SCID mice. A subset of PDX models demonstrated atypical patterns of dissemination with mediastinal masses, hepatosplenomegaly, and CD45-positive lymphoblastic atypia without ovarian tumor engraftment. Expression of human CD20 but not CD3 supported a B-cell lineage, and EBV genomes were detected in all lymphoproliferative tumors. Immunophenotyping confirmed monoclonal gene rearrangements consistent with B-cell lymphoma, and global gene expression patterns correlated well with other human lymphomas. The ability of rituximab, an anti-CD20 antibody, to suppress human lymphoproliferation from a patient's ovarian tumor in SCID mice and prevent growth of an established lymphoma led to a practice change with a goal to reduce the incidence of lymphomas. A single dose of rituximab during the primary tumor heterotransplantation process reduced the incidence of CD45-positive cells in subsequent PDX lines from 86.3% (n = 117 without rituximab) to 5.6% (n = 160 with rituximab), and the lymphoma rate declined from 11.1% to 1.88%. Taken together, investigators utilizing PDX models for research should routinely monitor for lymphoproliferative tumors and consider implementing methods to suppress their growth.",

The most frequently inactivated tumor suppressor gene in MPM is CDKN2A/ARF, encoding for the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4a and p14ARF, deleted in about 70% of MPM cases. Considering the high frequency of alterations of this gene, we tested in MPM cells the efficacy of palbociclib (PD-0332991), a highly selective inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6. The analyses were performed on a panel of MPM cell lines and on two primary culture cells from pleural effusion of patients with MPM. All the MPM cell lines, as well as the primary cultures, were sensitive to palbociclib with a significant blockade in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and with the acquisition of a senescent phenotype. Palbociclib reduced the phosphorylation levels of CDK6 and Rb, the expression of myc with a concomitant increased phosphorylation of AKT. Based on these results, we tested the efficacy of the combination of palbociclib with the PI3K inhibitors NVP-BEZ235 or NVP-BYL719. After palbociclib treatment, the sequential association with PI3K inhibitors synergistically hampered cell proliferation and strongly increased the percentage of senescent cells. In addition, AKT activation was repressed while p53 and p21 were up-regulated. Interestingly, two cycles of sequential drug administration produced irreversible growth arrest and senescent phenotype that were maintained even after drug withdrawal. These findings suggest that the sequential association of palbociclib with PI3K inhibitors may represent a valuable therapeutic option for the treatment of MPM.",

They display a hierarchical arrangement with a population of self-renewing and highly tumorigenic cells called cancer stem cells. These cells are thought to be responsible for tumor recurrence, which make them main candidates for targeted therapies. Unbridled cell cycle progression may explain the selective sensitivity of some cancer cells to treatments. The members of the Cip/Kip family p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 were initially considered as tumor suppressors based on their ability to block proliferation. However, they are currently looked at as proteins with dual roles in cancer: one as tumor suppressor and the other as oncogene. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the functions of these cell cycle inhibitors in five patient-derived glioma stem cell\u2013enriched cell lines. We found that these proteins are functional in glioma stem cells. They negatively regulate cell cycle progression both in unstressed conditions and in response to genotoxic stress. In addition, p27Kip1 is upregulated in nutrient-restricted and differentiating cells, suggesting that this Cip/Kip is a mediator of antimitogenic signals in glioma cells. Importantly, the lack of these proteins impairs cell cycle halt in response to genotoxic agents, rendering cells more vulnerable to DNA damage. For these reasons, these proteins may operate both as tumor suppressors, limiting cell proliferation, and as oncogenes, conferring cell resistance to DNA damage. Thus, deepening our knowledge on the biological functions of these Cip/Kips may shed light on how some cancer cells develop drug resistance.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Therapeutic strategies targeting immune checkpoint proteins have led to significant responses in patients with various tumor types. The success of these studies has led to the development of various antibodies/inhibitors for the different checkpoint proteins involved in immune evasion of the tumor. Adenosine present in high concentrations in the tumor microenvironment activates the immune checkpoint adenosine A2a receptor (A2aR), leading to the suppression of antitumor responses. Inhibition of this checkpoint has the potential to enhance antitumor T-cell responsiveness. METHODS: We developed a novel A2aR antagonist (PBF-509) and tested its antitumor response in vitro, in a mouse model, and in non-small cell lung cancer patient samples. RESULTS: Our studies showed that PBF-509 is highly specific to the A2aR as well as inhibitory of A2aR function in an in vitro model. In a mouse model, we found that lung metastasis was decreased after treatment with PBF-509 compared with its control. Furthermore, freshly resected tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from lung cancer patients showed increased A2aR expression in CD4+ cells and variable expression in CD8+ cells. Ex vivo studies showed an increased responsiveness of human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes when PBF-509 was combined with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of the A2aR using the novel inhibitor PBF-509 could lead to novel immunotherapeutic strategies in non-small cell lung cancer.",

Tumor volume and weight showed an inverse association with the higher allergic response and were significantly reduced in the PA-treated IL-4 mice when compared with those of AOO-treated IL-4 control mice. Significantly higher activation of STAT6, as well as IL-4 and NK cell activation, was found in the tumor tissues of PA-treated IL-4 mice. Infiltration of immune cells and cytokine levels were also higher in the tumor tissues of PA-treated IL-4 mice. We further found that IL-4\u2013activated NK-92MI cells showed increased anticancer effects in human melanoma cells.

     "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian carcinoma spreads via shedding of cells and multicellular aggregates (MCAs) from the primary tumor into peritoneal cavity, with subsequent intraperitoneal tumor cell:mesothelial cell adhesion as a key early event in metastatic seeding. Evaluation of human tumor extracts and tissues confirms that well-differentiated ovarian tumors express abundant E-cadherin (Ecad), whereas advanced lesions exhibit upregulated N-cadherin (Ncad). Two expression patterns are observed: \u201cmixed cadherin,\u201d in which distinct cells within the same tumor express either E- or Ncad, and \u201chybrid cadherin,\u201d wherein single tumor cell(s) simultaneously expresses both cadherins. We demonstrate striking cadherin-dependent differences in cell-cell interactions, MCA formation, and aggregate ultrastructure. Mesenchymal-type Ncad+ cells formed stable, highly cohesive solid spheroids, whereas Ecad+ epithelial-type cells generated loosely adhesive cell clusters covered by uniform microvilli. Generation of \u201cmixed cadherin\u201d MCAs using fluorescently tagged cell populations revealed preferential sorting into cadherin-dependent clusters, whereas mixing of cell lines with common cadherin profiles generated homogeneous aggregates. Recapitulation of the \u201chybrid cadherin\u201d Ecad+/Ncad+ phenotype, via insertion of the CDH2 gene into Ecad+ cells, resulted in the ability to form heterogeneous clusters with Ncad+ cells, significantly enhanced adhesion to organotypic mesomimetic cultures and peritoneal explants, and increased both migration and matrix invasion. Alternatively, insertion of CDH1 gene into Ncad+ cells greatly reduced cell-to-collagen, cell-to-mesothelium, and cell-to-peritoneum adhesion. Acquisition of the hybrid cadherin phenotype resulted in altered MCA surface morphology with increased surface projections and increased cell proliferation. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis that MCA cadherin composition impacts intraperitoneal cell and MCA dynamics and thereby affects ultimate metastatic success.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is arguably the deadliest form of breast cancer due to its rapid onset and highly invasive nature. IBC carries 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates of ~45% and <20%, respectively. Multiple studies demonstrate that in comparison with conventional breast cancer, IBC has a unique molecular identity. Here, we have identified platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) as being uniquely expressed and active in IBC patient tumor cells. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Here we focus on characterizing and targeting PDGFRA in IBC. Using gene expression, we analyzed IBC patient samples and compared them with non-IBC patient samples. Further, using IBC cells in culture, we determined the effect of small molecules inhibitors in both in vitro and in vivo assays. RESULTS: In IBC patients, we show more frequent PDGFRA activation signature than non-IBC samples. In addition, the PDGFRA activation signature is associated with shorter metastasis-free survival in both uni- and multivariate analyses. We also demonstrate that IBC cells express active PDGFRA. Finally, we show that PDGFRA targeting by crenolanib (CP-868-596), but not imatinib (STI571), two small molecule inhibitors, interferes with IBC cell growth and emboli formation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that PDGFRA may be a promising target for therapy in IBC.",

Therefore, we propose a pipeline to uncover patterns of alternative polyadenylation (APA), a hidden complexity in cancer transcriptomes, to further accelerate efforts to discover novel cancer genes and pathways. Here, we analyzed expression data for 1045 cancer patients and found a significant shift in usage of poly(A) signals in common tumor types (breast, colon, lung, prostate, gastric, and ovarian) compared to normal tissues. Using machine-learning techniques, we further defined specific subsets of APA events to efficiently classify cancer types. Furthermore, APA patterns were associated with altered protein levels in patients, revealed by antibody-based profiling data, suggesting functional significance. Overall, our study offers a computational approach for use of APA in novel gene discovery and classification in common tumor types, with important implications in basic research, biomarker discovery, and precision medicine approaches.",

It is a challenge to develop anti-HCC drugs due to HCC's extreme aggressiveness and with the sensitivity of the liver to show severe adverse effects. More importantly, the precise mechanisms causing HCC pathogenicity are not known. Our previous study disclosed Nogo-B as a reticulon 4 (Rtn4) family member. In the present study, we first identified that Nogo-B played a critical role in HCC progression. We found, via in vitro and in vivo assays, that Nogo-B was expressed aberrantly in primary HCC tumor tissues and immortal HCC cells but was relatively scarce in the normal liver tissues or cells. Nogo-B knockout, via the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, resulted in significant suppression of HCC cell proliferation and tumor growth. Next-generation sequencing analysis showed that Nogo-B knockout have effects on interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling pathway. Furthermore, we observed that IL-6 induced phosphorylation of STAT3 (pSTAT3) in wild-type HCC cells, but Nogo-B knockout could reduce IL-6\u2013induced increase of pSTAT3, supporting that Nogo-B affects HCC tumor progression possibly via regulating the IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, Nogo-B is expressed aberrantly in HCCs and plays an oncogenic role. These findings support that Nogo-B may be a novel anti-HCC therapeutic target.",

Here, we investigate the chemopreventive effect of the phytonutrient Withaferin A (WA) on AKT-driven prostate tumorigenesis in a Pten conditional knockout (Pten-KO) mouse model of prostate cancer. Oral WA treatment was carried out at two different doses (3 and 5 mg/kg) and compared to vehicle over 45 weeks. Oral administration of WA for 45 weeks effectively inhibited primary tumor growth in comparison to vehicle controls. Pathological analysis showed the complete absence of metastatic lesions in organs from WA-treated mice, whereas discrete metastasis to the lungs was observed in control tumors. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the down-regulation of pAKT expression and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, such as \u03b2-catenin and N-cadherin, in WA-treated tumors in comparison to controls. This result corroborates our previous findings from both cell culture and xenograft models of prostate cancer.

Here, we used pioneer models of myxoid/round cell liposarcoma (MRCLS) and undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS) developed from transformed human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) to evaluate the effect of trabectedin in the cell type responsible for initiating sarcomagenesis and their derived cancer stem cells (CSC) subpopulations. We found that low nanomolar concentrations of trabectedin efficiently inhibited the growth of sarcoma-initiating cells, induced cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and apoptosis. Interestingly, trabectedin treatment repressed the expression of multiple genes responsible for the development of the CSC phenotype, including pluripotency factors, CSC markers and related signaling pathways. Accordingly, trabectedin induced apoptosis and reduced the survival of CSC-enriched tumorsphere cultures with the same efficiency that inhibits the growth of bulk tumor population. In vivo, trabectedin significantly reduced the mitotic index of MRCLS xenografts and inhibited tumor growth at a similar extent to that observed in doxorubicin-treated tumors. Combination of trabectedin with campthotecin (CPT), a chemotherapeutic drug that shows a robust anti-tumor activity when combined with alkylating agents, resulted in a very strong synergistic inhibition of tumor cell growth and highly increased DNA damage and apoptosis induction. Importantly, the enhanced anti-tumor activity of this combination was also observed in CSC subpopulations. These data suggest that trabectedin and CPT combination may constitute a novel strategy to effectively target both the cell-of-origin and CSC subpopulations in sarcoma.",

Using epithelial ovarian cancer as model setting, we show here that ex vivo NKG2D+ cancer cells have stem-like capacities, and provide formal in vivo evidence linking NKG2D stimulation with the development and maintenance of these functional states. NKG2D+ ovarian cancer cell populations harbor substantially greater capacities for self-renewing in vitro sphere formation and in vivo tumor initiation in immunodeficient (NOD scid gamma) mice than NKG2D\u2212 controls. Sphere formation and tumor initiation are impaired by NKG2D silencing or ligand blockade using antibodies or a newly designed pan ligand-masking NKG2D multimer. In further support of pathophysiological significance, a prospective study of 47 high-grade serous ovarian cancer cases revealed that the odds of disease recurrence were significantly greater and median progression-free survival rates higher among patients with above and below median NKG2D+ cancer cell frequencies, respectively.

     "abstract": "The transformation of a normal cell to cancer requires the derail of multiple pathways. Normal signaling in a cell is regulated at multiple stages by the presence of feedback loops, calibration of levels of proteins by their regulated turnover, and posttranscriptional regulation, to name a few. The tumor suppressor protein FBXO31 is a component of the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase and is required to arrest cells at G1 following genotoxic stresses. Due to its growth-suppression activity, it is underexpressed in many cancers. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the translational regulation of FBXO31 remains unclear. Here we show that the oncogenic microRNAs miR-93 and miR-106a repress FBXO31, resulting in the upregulation of Slug, which is involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell invasion. FBXO31 targets and ubiquitylates Slug for proteasomal degradation. However, this mechanism is repressed in breast tumors where miR-93 and miR-106a are overexpressed. Our study further unravels an interesting mechanism whereby Slug drives the expression of miR-93 and miR-106a, thus establishing a positive feedback loop to maintain an invasive phenotype. Together, these results establish the presence of interplay between microRNAs and the ubiquitination machinery, which together regulate cancer cell invasion.",

Herein, we used a mouse genetic model to activate platelet derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFR\u03b1) specifically in the stroma. Hyperactivation of PDGFR\u03b1 in the mammary stroma severely hindered pubertal mammary ductal morphogenesis, but did not interrupt the lobuloalveolar differentiation program. Increased stromal PDGFR\u03b1 signaling induced mammary fat pad fibrosis with a corresponding increase in interstitial hyaluronic acid (HA) and collagen deposition. Mammary fibroblasts with PDGFR\u03b1 hyperactivation also decreased hydraulic permeability of a collagen substrate in an in vitro microfluidic device assay, which was mitigated by inhibition of either PDGFR\u03b1 or HA. Fibrosis seen in this model significantly increased the overall stiffness of the mammary gland as measured by atomic force microscopy. Further, mammary tumor cells injected orthotopically in the fat pads of mice with stromal activation of PDGFR\u03b1 grew larger tumors compared to controls. Taken together, our data establish that aberrant stromal PDGFR\u03b1 signaling disrupts ECM homeostasis during mammary gland development, resulting in increased mammary stiffness and increased potential for tumor growth.",

Gemcitabine remains as a standard care for PDAC patients. Although protein neddylation is abnormally activated in many human cancers, whether neddylation dysregulation is involved in PDAC and whether targeting neddylation would sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine remain elusive. Here we report that high expression of neddylation components, NEDD8 and NAE1, are associated with poor survival of PDAC patients. Blockage of neddylation by MLN4924, a small molecule inhibitor targeting this modification, significantly sensitizes pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine, as evidenced by reduced growth both in monolayer culture and soft agar, reduced clonogenic survival, decreased invasion capacity, increased apoptosis, G2/M arrest, and senescence. Importantly, combinational treatment of MLN4924-gemcitabine near completely suppressed in vivo growth of pancreatic cancer cells. Mechanistically, accumulation of NOXA, a pro-apoptotic protein and ERBIN, a RAS signal inhibitor, appears to play, at least in part, a causal role in MLN4924 chemo-sensitization. Our study demonstrates that neddylation modification is a valid target for PDAC, and provides the proof-of-concept evidence for future clinical trial of MLN4924-gemcitabine combination for the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients.",

The prognosis of GC is dismal in Western countries due to late diagnosis: approximately 70% of the patients die within 5 years following initial diagnosis. Recently, integrative genomic analyses led to the proposal of a molecular classification of GC into four subtypes, i.e.,microsatellite-instable, Epstein-Barr virus\u2013positive, chromosomal-instable (CIN), and genomically stable GCs. Molecular classification of GC advances our knowledge of the biology of GC and may have implications for diagnostics and patient treatment. Diagnosis of microsatellite-instable GC and Epstein-Barr virus\u2013positive GC is more or less straightforward. Microsatellite instability can be tested by immunohistochemistry (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6) and/or molecular-biological analysis. Epstein-Barr virus\u2013positive GC can be tested by in situ hybridization (Epstein-Barr virus encoded small RNA). However, with regard to CIN, testing may be more complicated and may require a more in-depth knowledge of the underlying mechanism leading to CIN. In addition, CIN GC may not constitute a distinct subgroup but may rather be a compilation of a more heterogeneous group of tumors. In this review, we aim to clarify the definition of CIN and to point out the molecular mechanisms leading to this molecular phenotype and the challenges faced in characterizing this type of cancer.",

In vitro cell viability assays indicated that metformin didn't potentiate the growth inhibitory effects of erlotinib at different doses in cell lines that are of distinct genetic background. EGFR downstream signaling evaluation further demonstrated that metformin, at its IC50 value, modified apoptosis caused in erlotinib or chemotherapeutic agent-treated cells via AKT activation and the inhibition of caspase 3 and PARP cleavages. These regulations were driven independently from EGFR, LKB1, KRAS, PTEN and p53 status. Metformin triggered autophagy (LC3B expression) was identified to interplay with apoptosis to attenuate the drug effect and postpone cancer cell death. In the retrospective study of 8 NSCLC patients, the administration of metformin did not induce statistically significant changes as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of pERK, pAKT and cleaved PARP. Consequently, the application of metformin for T2D NSCLC patients receiving chemo or EGFR targeted therapy should be considered with caution.",

We knocked down KLK6 expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells to determine the significance of KLK6 expression for metastatic dissemination and to identify the KLK6-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) signaling networks in metastatic colon cancer. KLK6 suppression resulted in decreased cells invasion in vitro with a minimal effect on the cell growth and viability. In vivo, animals with orthotopic colon tumors deficient in KLK6 expression had the statistically significant increase in survival rates (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005) and decrease in incidence of distant metastases.

The established miRNA-mRNA interactions modulate cellular proliferation, differentiation and epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT) in KLK6-expressing colon cancer cells via the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and RAS-related GTP-binding proteins. We confirmed the potential tumor suppressive properties of miR-181d and miR-203 in KLK6-expressing HCT116 cells using Matrigel invasion assay.

FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a gene that is amplified in human breast cancer, but there have been no definitive studies on its function in mammary tumorigenesis, progression, and metastasis in vivo in spontaneous tumors in mice. We used the retroviral tumor knockout, or TuKO, strategy to delete fgfr1 in PyMT-induced mammary tumors in K19-tva/fgfr1loxP/loxP mice. The similarly injected control K19-tva mice developed mammary tumors exhibiting high metastasis to lung, making this an ideal model for breast cancer metastasis. The fgfr1 TuKO tumors showed significantly decreased primary tumor growth and, most importantly, greatly reduced metastasis to lung. In contrast to previous reports, FGFR1 action in this spontaneous mammary tumor model does not significantly induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Loss of FGFR1 does generate a gene signature that is reverse correlated with FGFR1 gene amplification and/or upregulation in human breast cancer. Our results suggest that FGFR1 signaling is a key pathway driving breast cancer lung metastasis and that targeting FGFR1 in breast cancer is an exciting approach to inhibit metastasis.",

Among the EMT-related genes upregulated by direct coculture with MSCs, we examined the immune localization of FN, a well-known EMT marker. In coculture assay in chamber slides, expression of FN was seen only at the edges of cancer clusters where cancer cells directly contacted MSCs. FN expression in cancer cells increased at the tumor periphery and invasive edge in orthotopic nude mouse tumors and human colon cancer tissues.

Both subunits are highly expressed in many diverse tumor cell lines and primary tumors, and this is correlated with poor prognosis. Inhibiting DDK causes apoptosis of tumor cells, but not normal cells, through a largely unknown mechanism. Firstly, to understand why DDK is often overexpressed in tumors, we identified gene expression signatures that correlate with DDK high- and DDK low-expressing lung adenocarcinomas. We found that increased DDK expression is highly correlated with inactivation of RB1-E2F and p53 tumor suppressor pathways. Both CDC7 and DBF4 promoters bind E2F, suggesting that increased E2F activity in RB1 mutant cancers promotes increased DDK expression. Surprisingly, increased DDK expression levels are also correlated with both increased chemoresistance and genome-wide mutation frequencies. Our data further suggest that high DDK levels directly promote elevated mutation frequencies. Secondly, we performed an RNAi screen to investigate how DDK inhibition causes apoptosis of tumor cells. We identified 23 kinases and phosphatases required for apoptosis when DDK is inhibited. These hits include checkpoint genes, G2/M cell cycle regulators, and known tumor suppressors leading to the hypothesis that inhibiting mitotic progression can protect against DDKi-induced apoptosis. Characterization of one novel hit, the LATS2 tumor suppressor, suggests that it promotes apoptosis independently of the upstream MST1/2 kinases in the Hippo signaling pathway.",

This article reviews BMP4 signaling in central nervous system development and in glioma tumorigenesis, and the potential of this molecule as a treatment target in human gliomas. Further work needs to be done to determine if distinct lineages of GCSCs, associated with different glioma sub-classifications, proneural, neural, classical and mesenchymal, differ in responsiveness to BMP4 treatment.

In preclinical studies, we discovered that cardenolides synergize with MEK inhibitor to promote the regression of patient-derived xenografts irrespective of BRAF mutation status. We therefore conducted a phase 1B study of digoxin 0.25 mg and trametinib 2 mg given orally once daily in 20 patients with advanced, refractory, BRAF wild-type melanomas. The most common adverse events were rash, diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue. The response rate was 4/20 or 20% with response durations of 2, 4, 6, and 8 months. The disease control rate (including partial responses and stable disease) was 13/20 or 65% of patients, including 5/6 or 83% of patients with NRAS mutant melanomas and 8/14 or 57% of NRAS wild-type melanomas.

     "abstract": "Loss of basement membrane (BM) integrity is typically associated with cancer. Nidogen-1 is an essential component of the BM. Nidogen-1 is a substrate for cathepsin-S (CatS) which is released into the tumor microenvironment. Measuring nidogen-1 degraded by CatS may therefore have biomarker potential in cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate if CatS-degraded nidogen-1 was detectable in serum and a possible biomarker for cancer, a pathology associated with disruption of the BM. A competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (NIC) was developed with a monoclonal mouse antibody specific for a CatS cleavage site on human nidogen-1. Dilution and spiking recovery, inter- and intravariation, as well as accuracy were evaluated. Serum levels were evaluated in patients with breast cancer, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and non-SCLC (NSCLC) and in healthy controls. The results indicated that the NIC assay was specific for nidogen-1 cleaved by CatS. Inter- and intraassay variations were 9% and 14%, respectively. NIC was elevated in NSCLC as compared to healthy controls (P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), breast cancer (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01), and SCLC (P\u00a0<\u00a0.5). The diagnostic power (area under the receiver operating characteristics) of NIC for NSCLC as compared to all other samples combined was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.71-0.95), P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001. In conclusion, nidogen-1 degraded by CatS can be quantified in serum by the NIC assay. The current data strongly suggest that cathepsin-S degradation of nidogen-1 is strongly associated with NSCLC, which needs validation in larger clinical cohorts.",

     "abstract": "The A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase (ADAM) family of endopeptidases plays a role in many solid cancers and includes promising targets for anticancer therapies. Deregulation of ADAM15 has been linked to tumor aggressiveness and cell line studies suggest that ADAM15 overexpression may also be implicated in prostate cancer. To evaluate the impact of ADAM15 expression and its relationship with key genomic alterations, a tissue microarray containing 12,427 prostate cancers was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. ADAM15 expression was compared to phenotype, prognosis and molecular features including TMPRSS2:ERG fusion and frequent deletions involving PTEN, 3p, 5q and 6q. Normal prostate epithelium did not show ADAM15 staining. In prostate cancers, negative, weak, moderate, and strong ADAM15 staining was found in 87.7%, 3.7%, 5.6%, and 3.0% of 9826 interpretable tumors. Strong ADAM15 staining was linked to high Gleason grade, advanced pathological tumor stage, positive nodal stage and resection margin. ADAM15 overexpression was also associated with TMPRSS2:ERG fusions and PTEN deletions (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) but unrelated to deletions of 3p, 5q and 6q. In univariate analysis, high ADAM15 expression was strongly linked to PSA recurrence (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). However, in multivariate analyses this association was only maintained if the analysis was limited to preoperatively available parameters in ERG-negative cancers. The results of our study demonstrate that ADAM15 is strongly up regulated in a small but highly aggressive fraction of prostate cancers. In these tumors, ADAM15 may represent a suitable drug target. In a preoperative scenario, ADAM15 expression measurement may assist prognosis assessment, either alone or in combination with other markers.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive malignancy with a very poor prognosis. There is an urgent need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate PDAC cell aggressiveness. The transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is a nonselective cationic channel that mainly conducts Ca2+ and Mg2+. TRPM7 is overexpressed in numerous malignancies including PDAC. In the present study, we used the PANC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cell lines to specifically assess the role of TRPM7 in cell invasion and matrix metalloproteinase secretion. We show that TRPM7 regulates Mg2+ homeostasis and constitutive cation entry in both PDAC cell lines. Moreover, cell invasion is strongly reduced by TRPM7 silencing without affecting the cell viability. Conditioned media were further studied, by gel zymography, to detect matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) secretion in PDAC cells. Our results show that MMP-2, urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), and heat-shock protein 90\u03b1 (Hsp90\u03b1) secretions are significantly decreased in TRPM7-deficient PDAC cells. Moreover, TRPM7 expression in human PDAC lymph node metastasis is correlated to the channel expression in primary tumor. Taken together, our results show that TRPM7 is involved in PDAC cell invasion through regulation of Hsp90\u03b1/uPA/MMP-2 proteolytic axis, confirming that this channel could be a promising biomarker and possibly a target for PDAC metastasis therapy.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal carcinoma (CRC) is the most common cancer of the gastrointestinal tract with frequently dysregulated intracellular signaling pathways, including p53 signaling. The mainstay of chemotherapy treatment of CRC is 5-fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin. The two anticancer drugs mediate their therapeutic effect via DNA damage-triggered signaling. The small molecule reactivating p53 and inducing tumor apoptosis (RITA) is described as an activator of wild-type and reactivator of mutant p53 function, resulting in elevated levels of p53 protein, cell growth arrest, and cell death. Additionally, it has been shown that RITA can induce DNA damage signaling. It is expected that the therapeutic benefits of 5FU and oxaliplatin can be increased by enhancing DNA damage signaling pathways. Therefore, we highlighted the antiproliferative response of RITA alone and in combination with 5FU or oxaliplatin in human CRC cells. A panel of long-term established CRC cell lines (n\u00a0=\u00a09) including p53 wild-type, p53 mutant, and p53 null and primary patient-derived, low-passage cell lines (n\u00a0=\u00a05) with different p53 protein status were used for this study. A substantial number of CRC cells with pronounced sensitivity to RITA (IC50<\u00a03.0 \u03bcmol/l) were identified within established (4/9) and primary patient-derived (2/5) CRC cell lines harboring wild-type or mutant p53 protein. Sensitivity to RITA appeared independent of p53 status and was associated with an increase in antiproliferative response to 5FU and oxaliplatin, a transcriptional increase of p53 targets p21 and NOXA, and a decrease in MYC mRNA. The effect of RITA as an inducer of DNA damage was shown by a strong elevation of phosphorylated histone variant H2A.X, which was restricted to RITA-sensitive cells. Our data underline the primary effect of RITA, inducing DNA damage, and demonstrate the differential antiproliferative effect of RITA to CRC cells independent of p53 protein status. We found a substantial number of RITA-sensitive CRC cells within both panels of established CRC cell lines and primary patient-derived CRC cell lines (6/14) that provide a rationale for combining RITA with 5FU or oxaliplatin to enhance the antiproliferative response to both chemotherapeutic agents.",

A549 non\u2013small cell lung cancer cell line, engineered to express BAR, enabled the evaluation of compounds targeting the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway in vitro as well as in mouse models. We found that erlotinib treatment of resistant A549 subcutaneous and orthotopic xenografts resulted in significant AKT inhibition as determined by an 8- to 13-fold (P < .0001) increase in reporter activity 3 hours after erlotinib (100 mg/kg) administration compared to the control. This was confirmed by a 25% (P < .0001) decrease in pAKT ex vivo and a decrease in tumor growth. Treatment of the orthotopic xenograft with varying doses of erlotinib (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) revealed a dose- and time-dependent increase in reporter activity (10-, 12-, and 23-fold). Correspondingly, a decrease in phospho-AKT levels (0%, 16%, and 28%, respectively) and a decrease in the AKT dependent proliferation marker PCNA (0%, 50%, and 50%) were observed. We applied \u03bc-CT imaging for noninvasive longitudinal quantification of lung tumor load which revealed a corresponding decrease in tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate the utility of BAR to noninvasively monitor AKT activity in preclinical studies in response to AKT modulating agents. These results also demonstrate that BAR can be applied to study drug dosing, drug combinations, and treatment efficacy in orthotopic mouse lung tumor models.",

However, our lab has recently reported a previously unappreciated role for loss of UBQLN in lung cancer progression. In fact, UBQLN genes are lost in over 50% of lung cancer samples examined. However, a reason for the loss of UBQLN has not been proposed, nor has a selective pressure that could lead to deletion of UBQLN been reported. Diesel Exhaust Particles (DEP) are a major concern in the large cities of developing nations and DEP exposed populations are at an increased risk of developing a number of illnesses, including lung cancer. A connection between DEP and UBQLN has never been examined. In the present study, we determined the effect of DEP on lung cell lines and were interested to determine if UBQLN proteins could potentially play a protective role following treatment with DEP. Interestingly, we found that DEP treated cells have increased expression of UBQLN proteins. In fact, over-expression of UBQLN was capable of protecting cells from DEP toxicity. To investigate the mechanism by which DEP leads to increased UBQLN protein levels, we identified and interrogated microRNAs that were predicted to regulate UBQLN mRNA. We found that DEP decreases the oncogenic microRNA, MIR155. Further, we showed that MIR155 regulates the mRNA of UBQLN1 and UBQLN2 in cells, such that increased MIR155 expression increased cell invasion, migration, wound formation and clonogenicity in UBQLN-loss dependent manner. This is the first report of an environmental carcinogen regulating expression of UBQLN proteins. We show that exposure of cells to DEP causes an increase in UBQLN levels and that MIR155 regulates mRNA of UBQLN. Thus, we propose that DEP-induced repression of MIR155 leads to increased UBQLN levels, which in turn may be a selective pressure on lung cells to lose UBQLN1.",

However, the disease eventually progresses and develops resistance to ADT in majority of the patients, leading to the emergence of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Here, we assessed artesunate (AS), an artemisinin derivative, for its anticancer properties and ability to alleviate resistance to androgen receptor (AR) antagonists. We have shown AS in combination with bicalutamide (Bic) attenuates the oncogenic properties of the castrate-resistant (PC3, 22RV1) and androgen-responsive (LNCaP) PCa cells. Mechanistically, AS and Bic combination inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB signaling and decreases AR and/or AR-variant 7 expression via ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation. The combination induces oxidative stress and apoptosis via survivin downregulation and caspase-3 activation, resulting in poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, preclinical castrate-resistant PC3 xenograft studies in NOD/SCID mice (n =28, seven per group) show remarkable tumor regression and significant reduction in lungs and bone metastases upon administering AS (50 mg/kg per day in two divided doses) and Bic (50 mg/kg per day) via oral gavage. Taken together, we for the first time provide a compelling preclinical rationale that AS could disrupt AR antagonist\u2013mediated resistance observed in mCRPC. The current study also indicates that the therapeutic combination of Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved AS or NF-\u03baB inhibitors and AR antagonists may enhance the clinical efficacy in the treatment of mCRPC patients.",

Here, we investigated the effect of activation of STAT3 by cisplatin on anti-apoptotic proteins and the effectiveness of a co-treatment with cisplatin and a BH3 mimetic, ABT-737. We analyzed the relationship between cisplatin and STAT3 pathway and effect of ABT-737, when combined with cisplatin in NSCLC cells and K-ras mutant mouse models. The synergism of this combination was evaluated by the Chou-Talalay Combination Index method. In vivo activity was evaluated by micro-CT. In NSCLC cells, there was a time and dose-dependent phosphorylation of SRC-JAK2-STAT3 by cisplatin, followed by increased expression of anti-apoptotic molecules. When the expression of the BCL-2 protein family members was evaluated in clinical samples, BCL-xL was most frequently overexpressed. Dominant negative STAT3 suppressed their expression, suggesting that STAT3 mediates cisplatin mediated overexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecules. ABT-737 displaced BCL-xL from mitochondria and induced oligomerization of BAK. ABT-737 itself showed cytotoxic effects and a combination of ABT-737 with cisplatin showed strong synergistic cytotoxicity. In a murine lung cancer model, co-treatment with ABT-737 and cisplatin induced significant tumor regression. These findings reveal a synergistic cytotoxic and anti-tumor activity of ABT-737 and cisplatin co-treatment in preclinical models, and suggest that clinical trials using this strategy may be beneficial in advanced NSCLC.",

We tested the ability of two inhibitors of the glucose transporters GLUT/SLC2A superfamily, indinavir (IDV) and ritonavir (RTV), and of one inhibitor of the Na/glucose antiporter type 2 (SGLT2/SLC5A2) superfamily, phlorizin (PHZ), in decreasing glucose consumption and cell proliferation of human and murine glioblastoma cells. We found in vitro that RTV, active on at least three different GLUT/SLC2A transporters, was more effective than IDV, a specific inhibitor of GLUT4/SLC2A4, both in decreasing glucose consumption and lactate production and in inhibiting growth of U87MG and Hu197 human glioblastoma cell lines and primary cultures of human glioblastoma. PHZ was inactive on the same cells. Similar results were obtained when cells were grown in adherence or as 3D multicellular tumor spheroids. RTV treatment but not IDV treatment induced AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK\u03b1) phosphorylation that paralleled the decrease in glycolytic activity and cell growth. IDV, but not RTV, induced an increase in GLUT1/SLC2A1 whose activity could compensate for the inhibition of GLUT4/SLC2A4 by IDV. RTV and IDV pass poorly the blood brain barrier and are unlikely to reach sufficient liquoral concentrations in vivo to inhibit glioblastoma growth as single agents. Isobologram analysis of the association of RTV or IDV and 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) or 4-methyl-5-oxo-2,3,4,6,8-pentazabicyclo[4.3.0]nona-2,7,9-triene-9-carboxamide (TMZ) indicated synergy only with RTV on inhibition of glioblastoma cells.

In the present study, we found that MDR gastric and breast cancer cells possess a typical mesenchymal phenotype and enhanced cell migration capacity. Additionally, Cbl-b is poorly expressed in MDR gastric and breast cancer cells. In MDR gastric adenocarcinoma tissues, gastric cancer patients with low Cbl-b expression were more likely to have tumor invasion (P\u00a0=\u00a0.016) and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a0.007). Moreover, overexpression of Cbl-b reduced cell migration in MDR cell cultures both in vitro and in vivo. Cbl-b overexpression also prevented EMT by inducing ubiquitination and degradation of EGFR, leading to inhibition of the EGFR-ERK/Akt-miR-200c-ZEB1 axis. However, further overexpression of EGFR on a background of Cbl-b overexpression restored both the mesenchymal phenotype and cell migration capacity of MDR gastric and breast cancer cells. These results suggest that Cbl-b is an important factor for maintenance of the epithelial phenotype and inhibition of cell migration in MDR gastric and breast cancer cells.",

The results showed that epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment induced tyrosine phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination of PD-L1. Further characterization of EGF-induced PD-L1 ubiquitination revealed a significant increase in mono- and multiubiquitination of PD-L1 that occurred on glycosylated PD-L1. EGF induced mono- and multiubiquitination of PD-L1 preceded EGF-induced increases in PD-L1 protein levels. Chemical inhibitors of the EGFR pathway, gefitnib and SCH772984, suppressed PD-L1 mono- and multiubiquitination, and inhibition of the ubiquitin E1 activating enzyme, with the chemical inhibitor PYR41, was sufficient to block EGF-stimulated increases in PD-L1 protein levels. This study highlights the significance of identifying novel PTMs for PD-L1 and reveals potentially critical regulatory mechanisms that may be valuable therapeutic targets.

Three ATC cell lines were exposed to sorafenib in the presence or absence of HNHA, and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Effects of combined treatment on cell cycle and intracellular signaling pathways were assessed by flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The ATC cell lines xenograft model was used to examine the anti-tumor activity in vivo. Our data showed that HNHA and sorafenib synergistically decreased cell viability in ATC cells, and also significantly increased apoptotic cell death in these cells, as proved by the cleavage of caspase-3 and DNA fragmentation. HNHA and sorafenib combination was reduced anti-apoptotic factor in ATC. Thus, combination therapy with HNHA and sorafenib significantly decreased vessel density, and most significantly reduced tumor volume and increased survival in ATC xenografts.These results propose that HNHA in combination with sorafenib has significant anti-cancer activity in preclinical models, potentially suggesting a new clinical approach for patients of advanced thyroid cancer type.",

We found that PLCE1 was required to maintain protein level of snail a key transcription factor responsible for invasion. Our further transcriptomic data revealed that deficient cells were significantly decreased in expression of genes enriched as targets of Snail. Strikingly, recovery of Snail protein at least partially rescued the invasion and proliferation capacity in PLCE1 inactivated cells.

For this, tissue extracts from patients with EAC, BO, and normal esophagus were analyzed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance. Where possible, adjacent histologically normal tissues were sampled in those with EAC and BO. The study included 46 patients with EAC, 7 patients with BO, and 68 controls who underwent endoscopy for dyspeptic symptoms with normal appearances. Within the cancer cohort, 9 patients had nonneoplastic Barrett's adjacent to the cancer suitable for biopsy. It was possible to distinguish between histologically normal, BO, and EAC tissue in EAC patients [area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) 1.00, 0.86, and 0.91] and between histologically benign BO in the presence and absence of EAC (AUROC 0.79). In both these cases, sample numbers limited the power of the models. Comparison of histologically normal tissue proximal to EAC versus that from controls (AUROC 1.00) suggests a strong field effect which may develop prior to overt EAC and hence be useful for identifying patients at high risk of developing EAC. Excellent sensitivity and specificity were found for this model to distinguish histologically normal squamous esophageal mucosa in EAC patients and healthy controls, with 8 metabolites being very significantly altered.

     "abstract": "Heparanase activity is highly implicated in cellular invasion and tumor metastasis, a consequence of cleavage of heparan sulfate and remodeling of the extracellular matrix underlying epithelial and endothelial cells. Heparanase expression is rare in normal epithelia, but is often induced in tumors, associated with increased tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. In addition, heparanase induction promotes tumor growth, but the molecular mechanism that underlines tumor expansion by heparanase is still incompletely understood. Here, we provide evidence that heparanase down regulates the expression of p21 (WAF1/CIP1), a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that attenuates the cell cycle. Notably, a reciprocal effect was noted for PG545, a potent heparanase inhibitor. This compound efficiently reduced cell proliferation, colony formation, and tumor xenograft growth, associating with a marked increase in p21 expression. Utilizing the APC Min+/\u2212 mouse model, we show that heparanase expression and activity are increased in small bowel polyps, whereas polyp initiation and growth were significantly inhibited by PG545, again accompanied by a prominent induction of p21 levels. Down-regulation of p21 expression adds a novel feature for the emerging pro-tumorigenic properties of heparanase, while the potent p21 induction and anti-tumor effect of PG545 lends optimism that it would prove an efficacious therapeutic in colon carcinoma patients.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND & AIM: p53 activation by cellular stresses induces the transcription of hundreds of its target genes. To elucidate the entire picture of its downstream pathway, we screened a cDNA microarray dataset of adriamycin-treated HCT116 p53\u2212/\u2212 or p53+/+ cells and identified EPSIN 3 as a novel p53 target. METHODS: Potential p53 binding sequences in the EPSIN 3 locus were evaluated by reporter and CHIP assays. To investigate the role of EPSIN 3 in the p53 downstream pathway, we assessed DNA damage-induced apoptosis in EPSIN 3-knockdown HCT116 cells or Epsin 3-deficient mice. In addition, we evaluated EPSIN 3 expression levels in various tissues, including gastric adenocarcinoma, human gastric mucosa with or without Helicobacter pylori infection, and mouse acute gastritis tissues induced by indomethacin. RESULTS: In response to DNA damage, p53 induced the expression of EPSIN 3 through the p53 binding elements in the EPSIN 3 promoter and the first intron. Knockdown of EPSIN 3 resulted in resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. EPSIN 3 expression was down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues compared with normal tissues. In addition, Helicobacter pylori infection and indomethacin-induced acute gastritis repressed EPSIN 3 expression in gastric mucosa. CONCLUSIONS: EPSIN 3 is a novel p53 target and a key mediator of apoptosis. Chronic or acute mucosal inflammation as well as p53 inactivation induced down-regulation of EPSIN 3 and subsequently caused apoptosis resistance, which is a hallmark of cancer cells.",

Two independent patient cohorts were investigated to define the workflow, turnaround times, feasibility, and reliability of OFA targeted sequencing in clinical application and using archival material. Cohort I consisted of 59 diagnostic clinical samples from the daily routine submitted for molecular testing over a 4-month time period. Cohort II consisted of 39 archival melanoma samples that were up to 15\u00a0years old. Libraries were prepared from isolated nucleic acids and sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM sequencer. Sequencing datasets were analyzed using the Ion Reporter software. Genomic alterations were identified and validated by orthogonal conventional assays including pyrosequencing and immunohistochemistry. Sequencing results of both cohorts, including archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded material stored up to 15\u00a0years, were consistent with published variant frequencies. A concordance of 100% between established assays and OFA targeted NGS was observed. The OFA workflow enabled a turnaround of 3\u00bd days. Taken together, OFA was found to be a convenient tool for fast, reliable, broadly applicable and cost-effective targeted NGS of tumor samples in routine diagnostics. Thus, OFA has strong potential to become an important asset for precision oncology.",

ELL2 and ELL-associated factor 2 (EAF2) form a stable complex, and their orthologs in Caenorhabditis elegans appear to be functionally similar. In C. elegans, the EAF2 ortholog eaf-1 was reported to interact with the retinoblastoma (RB) pathway to control development and fertility in worms. Because RB loss is frequent in prostate cancer, ELL2 interaction with RB might be important for prostate homeostasis. The present study explored physical and functional interaction of ELL2 with RB in prostate cancer. ELL2 expression in human prostate cancer specimens was detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction coupled with laser capture microdissection. Co-immunoprecipitation coupled with deletion mutagenesis was used to determine ELL2 association with RB. Functional interaction between ELL2 and RB was tested using siRNA knockdown, BrdU incorporation, Transwell, and/or invasion assays in LNCaP, C4-2, and 22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. ELL2 expression was downregulated in high\u2013Gleason score prostate cancer specimens. ELL2 could be bound and stabilized by RB, and this interaction was mediated through the N-terminus of ELL2 and the C-terminus of RB. Concurrent siRNA knockdown of ELL2 and RB enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion as compared to knockdown of ELL2 or RB alone in prostate cancer cells. ELL2 and RB can interact physically and functionally to suppress prostate cancer progression.",

However, the role of H19 in the tumorigenesis of colon cancer has not been fully illustrated. Recent studies suggested a potential relationship between H19 and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling. Considering the pivotal role of VDR signaling in the colon epithelium both physiologically and pathologically, the correlation between H19 and VDR signaling may have an important role in the development of colon cancer. In this study, the correlation between H19 and vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling and the underlying mechanisms in colon cancer were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The results suggested that VDR signaling was able to inhibit the expression of H19 through regulating C-Myc/Mad-1 network. H19, on the other hand, was able to inhibit the expression of VDR through micro RNA 675-5p (miR-675-5p). Furthermore, H19 overexpression induced resistance to the treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results suggested that H19 overexpression might be one of the mechanisms underlying the development of resistance to the treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 in the advanced stage of colon cancer.",

Though there is an improvement in the prognosis of WT, still 10% of patients with WT die due to recurrence. Thus more effective treatment approaches are necessary. We previously characterized the inflammatory microenvironment in human WT and observed the robust expression of COX-2. The aim of this study was to extend our studies to analyze the role of COX-2 pathway components in WT progression using a mouse model of WT. Herein, COX-2 pathway components such as COX-2, HIF1-\u03b1, p-ERK1/2, and p-STAT3 were upregulated in mouse and human tumor tissues. In our RPPA analysis, COX-2 was up-regulated in M15 cells after Wt1 gene was knocked down. Flow cytometry analysis showed the increased infiltration of immune suppressive inflammatory cells such as pDC's and Treg cells in tumors. The chemotactic chemokines responsible for the infiltration of these cells were also induced in CCR5 and CXCR4 dependent manner respectively. The immunosuppressive cytokines IL-10, TGF-\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1 were also up-regulated. Furthermore, more pronounced Th2 and Treg induced cytokine response was observed than Th1 response in tumors. Basing on all these evidences it is speculated that COX-2 pathway may be a beneficial target for the treatment of WT. It may be most effective as an adjuvant therapy together with other inhibitors. Thus, our current study provides a good rationale for initiating animal studies to confirm the efficacy of COX-2 inhibitors in decreasing tumor cell growth in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Therapeutic approaches to medulloblastoma (combination of surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy) have led to significant improvements, but these are achieved at a high cost to quality of life. Alternative therapeutic approaches are needed. Genetic mutations leading to the activation of the Hedgehog pathway drive tumorigenesis in ~30% of medulloblastoma. In a yeast two-hybrid proteomic screen, we discovered a novel interaction between GLI1, a key transcription factor for the mediation of Hedgehog signals, and PIN1, a peptidylprolyl cis/trans isomerase that regulates the postphosphorylation fate of its targets. The GLI1/PIN1 interaction was validated by reciprocal pulldowns using epitope-tagged proteins in HEK293T cells as well as by co-immunoprecipiations of the endogenous proteins in a medulloblastoma cell line. Our results support a molecular model in which PIN1 promotes GLI1 protein abundance, thus contributing to the positive regulation of Hedgehog signals. Most importantly, in vivo functional analyses of Pin1 in the GFAP-tTA;TRE-SmoA1 mouse model of Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma demonstrate that the loss of Pin1 impairs tumor development and dramatically increases survival. In summary, the discovery of the GLI1/PIN1 interaction uncovers PIN1 as a novel therapeutic target in Hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma tumorigenesis.",

While plexins are the known functional receptors for the semaphorins, there is evidence that transmembrane semaphorins may transmit a signal themselves through their short cytoplasmic tail, a phenomenon known as \u2018reverse signaling.\u2019 We used computational methods based upon correlated evolution of sequences of interacting proteins, mutational analysis and in vitro and in vivo measurements of tumor aggressiveness to show that when bound to PB1, transmembrane S4D associates with the Rac GTPase exchange factor T lymphoma invasion and metastasis (Tiam) 1, which activates Rac and promotes proliferation, invasion and metastasis in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. These results suggest that not only can S4D production by tumor cells affect the microenvironment, but engagement of this semaphorin at the cell surface activates a reverse signaling mechanism that influences tumor aggressiveness in OSCC.",

Analysis of approximately 10,000 tumor genomes uncovers a striking pattern of mutual exclusivity between PARK2 genetic loss and amplification of BCL2L1, implicating these genes in a common pathway. PARK2 directly binds to and ubiquitinates BCL-XL. Inactivation of PARK2 leads to aberrant accumulation of BCL-XL both in vitro and in vivo, and cancer-specific mutations in PARK2 abrogate the ability of the ubiquitin E3 ligase to target BCL-XL for degradation. Furthermore, PARK2 modulates mitochondrial depolarization and apoptosis in a BCL-XL-dependent manner. Thus, like genes at the nodal points of growth arrest pathways such as p53, the PARK2 tumor suppressor is able to exert its antiproliferative effects by regulating both cell cycle progression and programmed cell death.",

However, tumor responses are usually only partial, and regrowth occurs after drug withdrawal. TSC-associated tumors are highly vascular, and TSC patients with renal angiomyolipomas have elevated levels of circulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) A and VEGFD. Sorafenib inhibits multiple kinases including VEGF receptors and has been used to treat metastatic epithelioid angiomyolipoma in one case, but formal trials have not been undertaken.

Lactic acid is rapidly effluxed to the tumor microenvironment via a group of plasma-membrane transporters denoted monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) to prevent \u201cself-poisoning.\u201d One isoform, MCT2, has the highest affinity for lactate and thus should have the ability to respond to microenvironment conditions such as hypoxia, lactate, and pH to help maintain high glycolytic flux in the tumor. Yet, MCT2 is considered to not respond to hypoxia, which is counterintuitive. Its response to tumor lactate has not been reported. In this report, we experimentally identify the transcription initiation site/s for MCT2 in astrocytes (normal) and glioma (tumor). We then use a BACmid library to isolate a 4.2-kbp MCT2 promoter-exon I region and examine promoter response to glycolysis-mediated stimuli in glioma cells. Reporter analysis of nested-promoter constructs indicated response of MCT2 to hypoxia, pH, lactate, and glucose, the major physiological \u201cplayers\u201d that facilitate a tumor's growth and proliferation. Immunoblot analysis of native MCT2 expression under altered pH and hypoxia reflected the reporter data. The pH-mediated gene-regulation studies we describe are the first to record H+-based reporter studies for any mammalian system and demonstrate the exquisite response of the MCT2 gene to minute changes in tumor pH.

Mechanism dissection found C1QBP could interact with YBX1 to suppress the YBX1 activation via altering the YBX1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in RCC cells.

In this study, we tested whether olaptesed pegol (OLA-PEG, NOX-A12), a novel SDF-1\u03b1 inhibitor, could reverse the recruitment of macrophages and potentiate the antitumor effect of anti\u2013vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. We also tested whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent could provide early information on macrophage blockade. Orthotopic human G12 glioblastomas in nude mice and rat C6 glioblastomas were employed as the animal models. These were treated with bevacizumab or B-20, both anti-VEGF antibodies. Rats were MR imaged with ferumoxytol for macrophage detection. Tumor hypoxia and SDF-1\u03b1 expression were elevated by VEGF blockade. Adding OLA-PEG to bevacizumab or B-20 significantly prolonged the survival of rodents bearing intracranial GBM compared with anti-VEGF therapy alone. Intratumoral CD68+ tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) were increased by VEGF blockade, but the combination of OLA-PEG + VEGF blockade markedly lowered TAM levels compared with VEGF blockade alone. MRI with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent noninvasively demonstrated macrophage reduction in OLA-PEG + anti-VEGF\u2013treated rats compared with VEGF blockade alone. In conclusion, inhibition of SDF-1 with OLA-PEG inhibited the recruitment of TAMs by VEGF blockage and potentiated its antitumor efficacy in GBM. Noninvasive MRI with ferumoxytol as a contrast agent provides early information on the effect of OLA-PEG in reducing TAMs.",

METHODS: Studies were conducted in the murine syngeneic B16BL6 model and in the A375 and SK-MEL-3 human xenografts. ICF15002 was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and biodistribution, with iodine-125 for metabolism study, and iodine-131 for targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT). TRT efficacy was assessed by tumor volume measurement, with mechanistics and dosimetry parameters being determined in the B16BL6 model. Intracellular localization of ICF15002 was characterized by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). RESULTS: PET imaging with [18F]ICF15002 evidenced tumoral uptake of 14.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.11%ID/g and 4.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.93%ID/g in pigmented B16BL6 and SK-MEL-3 models, respectively, at 1 hour post inoculation. No accumulation was observed in the unpigmented A375 melanoma. SIMS demonstrated colocalization of ICF15002 signal with melanin polymers in melanosomes of the B16BL6 tumors. TRT with two doses of 20 MBq [131I]ICF15002 delivered an absorbed dose of 102.3 Gy to B16BL6 tumors, leading to a significant tumor growth inhibition [doubling time (DT) of 2.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.5 days in treated vs 1.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.3 in controls] and a prolonged median survival (27 days vs 21 in controls). P53S15 phosphorylation and P21 induction were associated with a G2/M blockage, suggesting mitotic catastrophe. In the human SK-MEL-3 model, three doses of 25 MBq led also to a DT increase (26.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.8 days vs 11.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8 in controls) and improved median survival (111 days vs 74 in controls). CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that ICF15002 fulfills suitable properties for bimodal imaging/TRT management of patients with pigmented melanoma.",

METHODS: Taking as a starting point our previous work in which tumors from 60 EOCRC cases (\u226445 years at the time of diagnosis) were analyzed by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), in the present study we performed an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis of those aCGH data in order to unveil possible associations between the CIN profile and the clinical features of the tumors. In addition, we evaluated the MSI and the CIMP statuses of the samples with the aim of investigating a possible relationship between copy number alterations (CNAs) and the MSI/CIMP condition in EOCRC. RESULTS: Based on the similarity of the CNAs detected, the unsupervised analysis stratified samples into two main clusters (A, B) and four secondary clusters (A1, A2, B3, B4). The different subgroups showed a certain correspondence with the molecular classification of colorectal cancer (CRC), which enabled us to outline an algorithm to categorize tumors according to their CIMP status. Interestingly, each subcluster showed some distinctive clinicopathological features. But more interestingly, the CIN of each subcluster mainly affected particular chromosomes, allowing us to define chromosomal regions more specifically affected depending on the CIMP/MSI status of the samples. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings may provide a basis for a new form of classifying EOCRC according to the genomic status of the tumors.",

We report here the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of lucitanib in experimental models with or without FGFR1/2 amplification or mutations. In cell assays, lucitanib potently inhibited the growth of tumor cell lines with amplified FGFR1 or mutated/amplified FGFR2. In all xenograft models studied, lucitanib demonstrated marked tumor growth inhibition due to potent inhibition of angiogenesis. Notably, in two lung cancer models with FGFR1 amplification, the antitumor efficacy was higher, suggesting that the simultaneous inhibition of VEGF and FGF receptors in FGFR1 dependent tumors can be therapeutically advantageous. Similar antitumor activity was observed in FGFR2 wild-type and amplified or mutated xenograft models.

Here we report GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein 78, also known as HSPA5, heat shock 70 kDa protein 5), which is highly expressed in cancer cells and indicated to play important roles in various cellular processes including ER (endoplasmic reticulum) stress and autophagy, as a novel substrate of GALNT6. We found that GALNT6-induced O-glycosylation is critical for the stability of GRP78, its subcellular localization in ER, and its anti-apoptotic function. Furthermore, we demonstrated that overexpression of GRP78 could be important for Golgi-to-ER relocation of GALNT6. Collectively, our study revealed biological significances of O-glycosylation of GRP78 protein, which might play significant roles in the survival of cancer cells, and thus provided a new insight in cancer cell death and useful information for development of anti-cancer treatment targeting the GALNT6-GRP78 pathway.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays a key role in the onset and development of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), with about half of them acquiring mutations in either CTNNB1 or AXIN1. However, it remains unclear whether these mutations impose sufficient \u03b2-catenin signaling or require upstream Wnt ligand activation for sustaining optimal growth, as previously suggested for colorectal cancers. Using a panel of nine HCC cell lines, we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of \u03b2-catenin impairs growth of all these lines. Blocking Wnt secretion, by either treatment with the IWP12 porcupine inhibitor or knockdown of WLS, reduces growth of most of the lines. Unexpectedly, interfering with Wnt secretion does not clearly affect the level of \u03b2-catenin signaling in the majority of lines, suggesting that other mechanisms underlie the growth-suppressive effect. However, IWP12 treatment did not induce autophagy or endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which may have resulted from the accumulation of Wnt ligands within the ER. Similar results were observed for colorectal cancer cell lines used for comparison in various assays. These results suggest that most colorectal and liver cancers with mutations in components of the \u03b2-catenin degradation complex do not strongly rely on extracellular Wnt ligand exposure to support optimal growth. In addition, our results also suggest that blocking Wnt secretion may aid in tumor suppression through alternative routes currently unappreciated.",

In this study we sought to explore the expression of HMGA1 in HCCs and cirrhotic tissues, and its effect in in vitro models. METHODS: We evaluated HMGA1 expression using gene expression microarrays (59 HCCs, of which 37 were matched with their corresponding cirrhotic tissue and 5 normal liver donors) and tissue microarray (192 HCCs, 108 cirrhotic tissues and 79 normal liver samples). HMGA1 expression was correlated with clinicopathologic features and patient outcome. Four liver cancer cell lines with stable induced or knockdown expression of HMGA1 were characterized using in vitro assays, including proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent growth. RESULTS: HMGA1 expression increased monotonically from normal liver tissues to cirrhotic tissue to HCC (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01) and was associated with Edmondson grade (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Overall, 51% and 42% of HCCs and cirrhotic tissues expressed HMGA1, respectively. Patients with HMGA1-positive HCCs had earlier disease progression and worse overall survival. Forced expression of HMGA1 in liver cancer models resulted in increased cell growth and migration, and vice versa. Soft agar assay showed that forced expression of HMGA1 led to increased foci formation, suggesting an oncogenic role of HMGA1 in hepatocarcinogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: HMGA1 is frequently expressed in cirrhotic tissues and HCCs and its expression is associated with high Edmondson grade and worse prognosis in HCC. Our results suggest that HMGA1 may act as oncogenic driver of progression, implicating it in tumor growth and migration potential in liver carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Despite the important role that mechanical forces play in tumor growth and therapy, the contribution of swelling to tumor mechanopathology remains unexplored. Tumors rich in hyaluronan exhibit a highly negative fixed charge density. Repulsive forces among these negative charges as well as swelling of cancer cells due to regulation of intracellular tonicity can cause tumor swelling and development of stress that might compress blood vessels, compromising tumor perfusion and drug delivery. Here, we designed an experimental strategy, using four orthotopic tumor models, to measure swelling stress and related swelling to extracellular matrix components, hyaluronan and collagen, as well as to tumor perfusion. Subsequently, interventions were performed to measure tumor swelling using matrix-modifying enzymes (hyaluronidase and collagenase) and by repurposing pirfenidone, an approved antifibrotic drug. Finally, in vitro experiments on cancer cell spheroids were performed to identify their contribution to tissue swelling. Swelling stress was measured in the range of 16 to 75 mm Hg, high enough to cause vessel collapse. Interestingly, while depletion of hyaluronan decreased swelling, collagen depletion had the opposite effect, whereas the contribution of cancer cells was negligible. Furthermore, histological analysis revealed the same linear correlation between tumor swelling and the ratio of hyaluronan to collagen content when data from all tumor models were combined. Our data further revealed an inverse relation between tumor perfusion and swelling, suggesting that reduction of swelling decompresses tumor vessels. These results provide guidelines for emerging therapeutic strategies that target the tumor microenvironment to alleviate intratumoral stresses and improve vessel functionality and drug delivery.",

     "abstract": "The study of alterations of tumor metabolism should allow the identification of new targets for innovative anticancer strategies. Metabolic alterations are generally established in vitro, and conclusions are often extrapolated to the in vivo situation without further tumor metabolic phenotyping. To highlight the key role of microenvironment on tumor metabolism, we studied the response of glycolytic and oxidative tumor models to metabolic modulations in vitro and in vivo. MDA-MB-231 and SiHa tumor models, characterized in vitro as glycolytic and oxidative, respectively, were studied. Theoretically, when passing from a hypoxic state to an oxygenated state, a Warburg phenotype should conserve a glycolytic metabolism, whereas an oxidative phenotype should switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism (Pasteur effect). This challenge was applied in vitro and in vivo to evaluate the impact of different oxic conditions on glucose metabolism. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake, lactate production, tumor oxygenation, and metabolic fluxes were monitored in vivo using positron emission tomography, microdialysis, electron paramagnetic resonance imaging, and 13C-hyperpolarizated magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. In vitro, MDA-MB-231 cells were glycolytic under both hypoxic and oxygenated conditions, whereas SiHa cells underwent a metabolic shift after reoxygenation. On the contrary, in vivo, the increase in tumor oxygenation (induced by carbogen challenge) led to a similar metabolic shift in glucose metabolism in both tumor models. The major discordance in metabolic patterns observed in vitro and in vivo highlights that any extrapolation of in vitro metabolic profiling to the in vivo situation should be taken cautiously and that metabolic phenotyping using molecular imaging is mandatory in vivo.",

This study was aimed at evaluating the efficacy of AR-42 (formerly OSU-HDAC42), a novel histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor currently in clinical trials, in suppressing tumor growth and/or cancer-induced muscle wasting in murine models of PDAC. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The in vitro antiproliferative activity of AR-42 was evaluated in six human pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, COLO-357, PANC-1, MiaPaCa-2, BxPC-3, SW1990). AsPC-1 subcutaneous xenograft and transgenic KPfl/flC (LSL-KrasG12D;Trp53flox/flox;Pdx-1-Cre) mouse models of pancreatic cancer were used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of AR-42 in suppressing tumor growth and/or muscle wasting. RESULTS: Growth suppression in AR-42\u2013treated cells was observed in all six human pancreatic cancer cell lines with dose-dependent modulation of proliferation and apoptotic markers, which was associated with the hallmark features of HDAC inhibition, including p21 upregulation and histone H3 hyperacetylation. Oral administration of AR-42 at 50 mg/kg every other day resulted in suppression of tumor burden in the AsPC-1 xenograft and KPfl/flC models by 78% and 55%, respectively, at the end of treatment. Tumor suppression was associated with HDAC inhibition, increased apoptosis, and inhibition of proliferation. Additionally, AR-42 as a single agent preserved muscle size and increased grip strength in KPfl/flC mice. Finally, the combination of AR-42 and gemcitabine in transgenic mice demonstrated a significant increase in survival than either agent alone. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that AR-42 represents a therapeutically promising strategy for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

Mirvetuximab soravtansine (IMGN853) is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets FR\u03b1 for tumor-directed delivery of the maytansinoid DM4, a potent agent that induces mitotic arrest by suppressing microtubule dynamics. Here, combinations of IMGN853 with approved therapeutics were evaluated in preclinical models of EOC. Combinations of IMGN853 with carboplatin or doxorubicin resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects in the IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cell line in vitro. IMGN853 potentiated the cytotoxic activity of carboplatin via growth arrest and augmented DNA damage; cell cycle perturbations were also observed in cells treated with the IMGN853/doxorubicin combination. These benefits translated into improved antitumor activity in patient-derived xenograft models in vivo in both the platinum-sensitive (IMGN853/carboplatin) and platinum-resistant (IMGN853/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) settings. IMGN853 co-treatment also improved the in vivo efficacy of bevacizumab in platinum-resistant EOC models, with combination regimens causing significant regressions and complete responses in the majority of tumor-bearing mice. Histological analysis of OV-90 ovarian xenograft tumors revealed that concurrent administration of IMGN853 and bevacizumab caused rapid disruption of tumor microvasculature and extensive necrosis, underscoring the superior bioactivity profile of the combination regimen.

Activation of WNT signaling is also commonly observed in PDAC. To ascertain the impact of postnatal activation of WNT-stimulated signaling pathways in PDAC development, we combined the Elastase-tva-based RCAS-TVA pancreatic cancer model with the established LSL-KrasG12D, Ptf1a-cre model. Delivery of RCAS viruses encoding \u03b2-cateninS37A and WNT1 stimulated the progression of premalignant pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (PanIN) and PDAC development. Moreover, mice injected with RCAS-\u03b2-cateninS37A or RCAS-Wnt1 had reduced survival relative to RCAS-GFP-injected controls (P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Ectopic expression of active \u03b2-catenin, or its DNA-binding partner TCF4, enhanced transformation associated phenotypes in PDAC cells. In contrast, these phenotypes were significantly impaired by the introduction of ICAT, an inhibitor of the \u03b2-catenin/TCF4 interaction. By gene expression profiling, we identified Cyr61 as a target molecule of the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cells. Nuclear \u03b2-catenin and CYR61 expression were predominantly detected in moderately to poorly differentiated murine and human PDAC. Indeed, nuclear \u03b2-catenin- and CYR61-positive PDAC patients demonstrated poor prognosis (P\u00a0<\u00a0.01). Knockdown of CYR61 in a \u03b2-catenin-activated pancreatic cancer cell line reduced soft agar, migration and invasion activity. Together, these data suggest that the WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway enhances pancreatic cancer development and malignancy in part via up-regulation of CYR61.",

High levels of the cytokine transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in HGG promote radioresistance by enforcing an effective DNA damage response and supporting glioma stem cell self-renewal. Our analysis of HGG TCGA data and immunohistochemical staining of phosphorylated Smad2, which is the main transducer of canonical TGF-\u03b2 signaling, indicated variable levels of TGF-\u03b2 pathway activation across HGG tumors. These data suggest that evaluating the putative benefit of inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 during radiotherapy requires personalized screening. Thus, we used explant cultures of seven HGG specimens as a rapid, patient-specific ex vivo platform to test the hypothesis that LY364947, a small molecule inhibitor of the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptor, acts as a radiosensitizer in HGG. Immunofluorescence detection and image analysis of \u03b3-H2AX foci, a marker of cellular recognition of radiation-induced DNA damage, and Sox2, a stem cell marker that increases post-radiation, indicated that LY364947 blocked these radiation responses in five of seven specimens. Collectively, our findings suggest that TGF-\u03b2 signaling increases radioresistance in most, but not all, HGGs.

     "abstract": "Hu-antigen R (HuR) is an RNA-binding posttranscriptional regulator that belongs to the Hu/ELAV family. HuR expression levels are modulated by a variety of proteins, microRNAs, chemical compounds, or the microenvironment, and in turn, HuR affects mRNA stability and translation of various genes implicated in breast cancer formation, progression, metastasis, and treatment. The aim of the present review is to critically summarize the role of HuR in breast cancer development and its potential as a prognosticator and a therapeutic target. In this aspect, all the existing English literature concerning HuR expression and function in breast cancer cell lines, in vivo animal models, and clinical studies is critically presented and summarized. HuR modulates many genes implicated in biological processes crucial for breast cancer formation, growth, and metastasis, whereas the link between HuR and these processes has been demonstrated directly in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, clinical studies reveal that HuR is associated with more aggressive forms of breast cancer and is a putative prognosticator for patients' survival. All the above indicate HuR as a promising drug target for cancer therapy; nevertheless, additional studies are required to fully understand its potential and determine against which types of breast cancer and at which stage of the disease a therapeutic agent targeting HuR would be more effective.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Preclinical and clinical studies have reported that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression yields resistance to endocrine therapies. Here the prevalence and prognostic impact of HER2-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) were investigated retrospectively in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients with a HER2-negative primary tumor receiving endocrine therapy. Additionally, the prevalence and prognostic significance of HER2-positive CTCs were explored in a chemotherapy cohort, as well as the prognostic impact of the estrogen receptor (ER) CTC status in both cohorts. METHODS: Included were MBC patients with a HER2-negative primary tumor, with \u22651 detectable CTC, starting a new line of treatment. CTCs were enumerated using the CellSearch system, characterized for HER2 with the CellSearch anti-HER2 phenotyping reagent, and characterized for ER mRNA expression. Primary end point was progression-free rate after 6 months (PFR6months) of endocrine treatment in HER2-positive versus HER2-negative CTC patients. RESULTS: HER2-positive CTCs were present in 29% of all patients. In the endocrine cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a072), the PFR6months was 53% for HER2-positive versus 68% for HER2-negative CTC patients (P\u00a0=\u00a0.23). In the chemotherapy cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a082), no prognostic value of HER2-positive CTCs on PFR6months was observed either. Discordances in ER status between the primary tumor and CTCs occurred in 25% of all patients but had no prognostic value in exploratory survival analyses. CONCLUSION: Discordances regarding HER2 status and ER status between CTCs and the primary tumor occurred frequently but had no prognostic impact in our MBC patient cohorts.",

     "abstract": "A number of clinical trials have shown that KRAS mutations of colorectal cancer (CRC) can predict a lack of responses to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor\u2013based therapy. Recently, there have been several studies to elucidate metabolism reprogramming in cancer. However, it remains to be investigated how mutated KRAS can coordinate the metabolic shift to sustain CRC tumor growth. In this study, we found that KRAS mutation in CRC caused alteration in amino acid metabolism. KRAS mutation causes a marked decrease in aspartate level and an increase in asparagine level in CRC. Using several human CRC cell lines and clinical specimens of primary CRC, we demonstrated that the expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS), an enzyme that synthesizes asparagine from aspartate, was upregulated by mutated KRAS and that ASNS expression was induced by KRAS-activated signaling pathway, in particular PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Importantly, we demonstrated that KRAS-mutant CRC cells could become adaptive to glutamine depletion through asparagine biosynthesis by ASNS and that asparagine addition could rescue the inhibited growth and viability of cells grown under the glutamine-free condition in vitro. Notably, a pronounced growth suppression of KRAS-mutant CRC was observed upon ASNS knockdown in vivo. Furthermore, combination of L-asparaginase plus rapamycin markedly suppressed the growth of KRAS-mutant CRC xenografts in vivo, whereas either L-asparaginase or rapamycin alone was not effective. These results indicate ASNS might be a novel therapeutic target against CRCs with mutated KRAS.",

     "abstract": "Resistance to chemotherapy is a hallmark of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) and has been partly attributed to the dense desmoplastic stroma, which forms a protective niche for cancer cells. Tissue transglutaminase (TG2), a Ca2+-dependent enzyme, is secreted by PDA cells and cross-links proteins in the tumor microenvironment (TME) through acyl-transfer between glutamine and lysine residues, promoting PDA growth. The objective of the current study was to determine whether secreted TG2 by PDA cells alters the response of pancreatic tumors to gemcitabine. Orthotopic pancreatic xenografts and co-culture of PDA and stromal cells were employed to determine the mechanisms by which TG2 alters tumor-stroma interactions and response to gemcitabine. Analysis of the pancreatic The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database demonstrated that increased TG2 expression levels correlate with worse overall survival (hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.37). Stable TG2 knockdown in PDA cells led to decreased size of pancreatic xenografts and increased sensitivity to gemcitabine in vivo. However, TG2 downregulation did not increase cytotoxicity of gemcitabine in vitro. Additionally, multivessel density and gemcitabine uptake in pancreatic tumor tissue, as measured by mass spectrometry (MS-HPLC), were not significantly different in tumors expressing TG2 versus tumors in which TG2 was knocked down. Fibroblasts, stimulated by TG2 secreted by PDA cells, secrete laminin A1, which protects cancer cells from gemcitabine-induced cytotoxicity. In all, our results demonstrate that TG2 secreted in the pancreatic TME orchestrates the cross talk between cancer cells and stroma, impacting tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. Our study supports TG2 inhibition to increase the antitumor effects of gemcitabine in PDA.",

Despite this fact, most anticancer therapeutics currently in clinical use have limited efficacy in treating established metastases. Here, we identify the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), as a metastatic dependency in several highly metastatic cancer cell models. We find that GRP78 is consistently upregulated when highly metastatic cancer cells colonize the lung microenvironment and that mitigation of GRP78 upregulation via short hairpin RNA or treatment with the small molecule IT-139, which is currently under clinical investigation for the treatment of primary tumors, inhibits metastatic growth in the lung microenvironment. Inhibition of GRP78 upregulation and an associated reduction in metastatic potential have been shown in four highly metastatic cell line models: three human osteosarcomas and one murine mammary adenocarcinoma. Lastly, we show that downmodulation of GRP78 in highly metastatic cancer cells significantly increases median survival times in our in vivo animal model of experimental metastasis. Collectively, our data indicate that GRP78 is an attractive target for the development of antimetastatic therapies.",

PDA in KFCfl/fl mice was preceded by earlier onset of acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) lesions, and associated with chromosomal instability and the accumulation of Fbxw7 substrates Yes-associated protein (Yap), c-Myc, and Notch. Using KFCfl/fl and FBXW7-deficient human pancreatic cancer cells, we found that Yap silencing attenuated growth promotion by Fbxw7 deletion.

Our goal was to understand the influence of Col1 fibers on water diffusion, and to examine the potential of using noninvasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to indirectly detect Col1 fibers in breast lesions. We previously observed, in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer xenografts engineered to fluoresce under hypoxia, relatively low amounts of Col1 fibers in fluorescent hypoxic regions. These xenograft tumors together with human breast cancer samples were used here to investigate the relationship between Col1 fibers, water diffusion and anisotropy, and hypoxia. Hypoxic low Col1 fiber containing regions showed decreased apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) compared to normoxic high Col1 fiber containing regions. Necrotic high Col1 fiber containing regions showed increased ADC with decreased FA values compared to normoxic viable high Col1 fiber regions that had increased ADC with increased FA values. A good agreement of ADC and FA patterns was observed between in vivo and ex vivo images. In human breast cancer specimens, ADC and FA decreased in low Col1 containing regions. Our data suggest that a decrease in ADC and FA values observed within a lesion could predict hypoxia, and a pattern of high ADC with low FA values could predict necrosis. Collectively the data identify the role of Col1 fibers in directed water movement and support expanding the evaluation of DTI parameters as surrogates for Col1 fiber patterns associated with specific tumor microenvironments as companion diagnostics and for staging.",

In the present study, by genetic and chemical means, we demonstrated that, KDM4C blockade selectively decreased the ESCC ALDHbri+ TICs population in vitro and specifically targeted the TICs in ALDHbri+-derived xenograft, retarding engraftment. Subsequent studies of the KDM4C functional network identified a subset of pluripotency-associated genes (PAGs) and aldehyde dehydrogenase family members to be preferentially down-regulated in KDM4C inhibited ALDHbri+ TICs. We further supported a model in which KDM4C maintains permissive histone modifications with a low level of H3K9 methylation at the promoters of several PAGs. Moreover, ectopic expression of SOX2 restored KDM4C inhibition-dependent ALDHbri+ TIC properties. We further confirmed these findings by showing that the cytoplasmic and nuclear KDM4C staining increased with adverse pathologic phenotypes and poor patient survival. Such staining pattern of intracellular KDM4C appeared to overlap with the expression of SOX2 and ALDH1.

Previously, we showed that \u03b2-catenin is downregulated by the 90K glycoprotein via ISGylation-dependent degradation. However, the further mechanisms of \u03b2-catenin degradation by 90K-mediated ISGylation pathway were not investigated. This study aimed to identify the \u03b2-catenin domain responsible for the action of 90K and to compare the mechanism of 90K on \u03b2-catenin degradation with phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitinational degradation of \u03b2-catenin. The deletion mutants of \u03b2-catenin lacking N- or C-terminal domain or mutating the N-terminal lysine or nonlysine residue were employed to delineate the characteristics of \u03b2-catenin degradation by 90K-mediated ISGylation pathway. 90K induced Herc5 and ISG15 expression and reduced \u03b2-catenin levels in HeLa and CSC221 cells. The N-terminus of \u03b2-catenin is required for 90K-induced \u03b2-catenin degradation, but the N-terminus of \u03b2-catenin is not essential for interaction with Herc5. However, substituting lysine residues in the N-terminus of \u03b2-catenin with arginine or deleting serine or threonine residue containing domains from the N-terminus does not affect 90K-induced \u03b2-catenin degradation, indicating that the N-terminal 86 amino acids of \u03b2-catenin are crucial for 90K-mediated ISGylation/degradation of \u03b2-catenin in which the responsible lysine or nonlysine residues were not identified. Our present results highlight the action of 90K on promoting degradation of mutant \u03b2-catenin lacking the phosphorylation sites in the N-terminus.

It is characterized by the unbalanced recurrent chromosomal translocation der(17)t(X;17)(p11;q25), resulting in the generation of an ASPL-TFE3 fusion gene. ASPL-TFE3 oncoprotein functions as an aberrant transcriptional factor and is considered to play a crucial role in the tumorigenesis of alveolar soft part sarcoma. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. In this study, we identified p21 (p21WAF1/CIP1) as a direct transcriptional target of ASPL-TFE3. Ectopic ASPL-TFE3 expression in 293 cells resulted in cell cycle arrest and significant increases in protein and mRNA levels of p21. ASPL-TFE3 activated p21 expression in a p53-independent manner through direct transcriptional interactions with the p21 promoter region. When ASPL-TFE3 was expressed in human bone marrow\u2013derived mesenchymal stem cells in a tetracycline-inducible manner, we observed the up-regulation of p21 expression and the induction of senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity. Suppression of p21 significantly decreased the induction of ASPL-TFE3-mediated cellular senescence. Furthermore, ASPL-TFE3 expression in mesenchymal stem cells resulted in a significant up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines associated with senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These results show that ASPL-TFE3 regulates cell cycle progression and induces cellular senescence by up-regulating p21 expression.

Current knowledge of TAMs and CAFs in the tumor microenvironment of urothelial cancer of the bladder (UCB) is limited. Therefore, we investigated the paracrine effect induced by TAMs and CAFs in the tumor microenvironment of human UCB. For this, we first carried out immunohistochemical analysis for CXCL1, CD204 (TAM marker), \u03b1SMA (CAF marker), E-cadherin, and MMP2 using 155 UBC tissue samples. Next, CXCL1-overexpressing clones of THP-1-derived TAMs and NIH3T3-derived CAFs were developed by lentiviral vector infection. The immunohistochemical study showed high CXCL1 levels in UCB cells to be associated with enhanced recruitment of TAMs/CAFs, higher metastatic potential, and poor prognosis. Three-dimensional (3D) co-culture of UCB cells and TAMs/CAFs suggested that CXCL1 production in TAMs/CAFs play an important role in cell-to-cell adhesion and interaction among cancer cells and these stromal cells. CXCL1-expressing TAMs/CAFs enhanced tumor growth of subcutaneous UCB tumors in nude mice when injected together. In addition, an experiment using the orthotopic bladder cancer model revealed that CXCL1 production in TAMs/CAFs supported tumor implantation into the murine bladder wall and UCB growth when injected together, which was confirmed by clinical data of patients with bladder cancer. Thus, CXCL1 signaling in the tumor microenvironment is highly responsible for repeated intravesical recurrence, disease progression, and drug resistance through enhanced invasion ability. In conclusion, disrupting CXCL1 signaling to dysregulate this chemokine is a promising therapeutic approach for human UCB.",

The goal of this study was to identify novel regulators of platin-induced cytotoxicity as potential therapeutic targets to further enhance platin cytotoxicity. Employing RNA-seq transcriptome analysis comparing two parental NSCLC cell lines Calu6 and H23 to their cisplatin-resistant sublines, Calu6cisR1 and H23cisR1, activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was robustly induced in cisplatin-treated parental sensitive cell lines but not their resistant sublines, and in three of six tumors evaluated, but not in their corresponding normal adjacent lung tissue (0/6). Cisplatin-induced JNK activation was a key regulator of this ATF3 induction. Interestingly, in both resistant sublines, this JNK induction was abrogated, and the expression of an activated JNK construct in these cells enhanced both cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity and ATF3 induction. An FDA-approved drug compound screen was employed to identify enhancers of cisplatin cytotoxicity that were dependent on ATF3 gene expression. Vorinostat, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, was identified in this screen and demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity with cisplatin in both the parental Calu6 and H23 cell lines and importantly in their resistant sublines as well that was dependent on ATF3 expression. Thus, we have identified ATF3 as an important regulator of cisplatin cytotoxicity and that ATF3 inducers in combination with platins are a potential novel therapeutic approach for NSCLC.",

LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1-Cre (KPC) mice showed that ETS2 expression initially increased in fibroblasts during ADM and remained elevated through progression to PDAC. Conditional ablation of Ets-2 in pancreatic fibroblasts in a KrasG12D-driven mouse ADM model decreased the amount of ADM events. ADMs from fibroblast Ets-2\u2013deleted animals had reduced epithelial cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. Surprisingly, fibroblast Ets-2 deletion significantly altered immune cell infiltration into the stroma, with an increased CD8+ T-cell population, and decreased presence of regulatory T cells (Tregs), myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and mature macrophages. The mechanism involved ETS2-dependent chemokine ligand production in fibroblasts. ETS2 directly bound to regulatory sequences for Ccl3, Ccl4, Cxcl4, Cxcl5, and Cxcl10, a group of chemokines that act as potent mediators of immune cell recruitment.

First, we observed that reduction of DNMT1 by 5-azacitidine (5-Aza) promotes EMT induction as well as CSCs and sphere formation in vitro. Reduced expression of DNMT1 significantly increased PCa migratory potential. We showed that the increase of EMT and CSC activities by reduction of DNMT1 is associated with the increase of protein kinase C. Furthermore, we confirmed that silencing DNMT1 is correlated with enhancement of the induction of EMT and the CSC phenotype in PCa cells. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay reveals that reduction of DNMT1 promotes the suppression of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 on the Zeb2 and KLF4 promoter region in PCa cells. Critically, we found in an animal model that significant tumor growth and more disseminated tumor cells in most osseous tissues were observed following injection of 5-Aza pretreated\u2013PCa cells compared with vehicle-pretreated PCa cells. Our results suggest that epigenetic alteration of histone demethylation regulated by reduction of DNMT1 may control induction of EMT and the CSC phenotype, which facilitates tumorigenesis in PCa cells and has important therapeutic implications in targeting epigenetic regulation.",

     "abstract": "Recently, activating mutations of the hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1 gene (HIF2A/EPAS1) have been recognized to predispose to multiple paragangliomas (PGLs) and duodenal somatostatinomas associated with polycythemia, and ocular abnormalities. Previously, mutations in the SDHA/B/C/D, SDHAF2, VHL, FH, PHD1, and PHD2 genes have been associated with HIF activation and the development of pseudohypoxic (cluster-1) PGLs. These tumors overlap in terms of tumor location, syndromic presentation, and noradrenergic phenotype to a certain extent. However, they also differ especially by clinical outcome and by presence of other tumors or abnormalities. In the present study, we aimed to establish additional molecular differences between HIF2A and non-HIF2A pseudohypoxic PGLs. RNA expression patterns of HIF2A PGLs (n\u00a0=\u00a06) from 2 patients were compared with normal adrenal medullas (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and other hereditary pseudohypoxic PGLs (VHL: n\u00a0=\u00a013, SDHB: n\u00a0=\u00a015, and SDHD: n\u00a0=\u00a014). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering showed that HIF2A PGLs made up a separate cluster from other pseudohypoxic PGLs. Significance analysis of microarray yielded 875 differentially expressed genes between HIF2A and other pseudohypoxic PGLs after normalization to adrenal medulla (false discovery rate 0.01). Prediction analysis of microarray allowed correct classification of all HIF2A samples based on as little as three genes (TRHDE, LRRC63, IGSF10; error rate: 0.02). Genes with the highest expression difference between normal medulla and HIF2A PGLs were selected for confirmatory quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In conclusion, HIF2A PGLs show a characteristic expression signature that separates them from non-HIF2A pseudohypoxic PGLs. Unexpectedly, the most significantly differentially expressed genes have not been previously described as HIF target genes.",

We tested 453 NSCLC samples from 407 individual patients using the 50 gene AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 from May 2013 to July 2015. Using 10 ng of DNA, up to 11 samples were simultaneously sequenced on the Ion Torrent PGM (316 and 318 chips). We identified variants with the Ion Torrent Variant Caller Plugin, and Golden Helix's SVS software was used for annotation and prediction of the significance of the variants. Three hundred ninety-eight samples were successfully sequenced (12.1% failure rate). In all, 633 variants in 41 genes were detected with a median of 2 (range of 0 to 7) variants per sample. Mutations detected in BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, and PIK3CA were considered potentially actionable and were identified in 237 samples, most commonly in KRAS (37.9%), EGFR (11.1%), BRAF (4.8%), and PIK3CA (4.3%). In our patient population, all mutations in EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF were mutually exclusive. The Ion Torrent Ampliseq technology can be utilized on small biopsy and cytology specimens, requires very little input DNA, and can be applied in clinical laboratories for genotyping of NSCLC. This targeted next-generation sequencing approach allows for detection of common and also rare mutations that are clinically actionable in multiple patients simultaneously.",

Here, we have created the Prkdc-null SCID zebrafish model which provides the stable immune-deficient background required for xenotransplantation of tumor cell. In this study, the two transcription activator-like effector nucleases that specifically target the exon3 of the zebrafish Prkdc gene were used to induce a frame shift mutation, causing a complete knockout of the gene function. The SCID zebrafish showed susceptibility to spontaneous infection, a well-known phenotype found in the SCID mutation. Further characterization revealed that the SCID zebrafish contained no functional T and B lymphocytes which reflected the phenotypes identified in the mice SCID model. Intraperitoneal injection of human cancer cells into the adult SCID zebrafish clearly showed tumor cell growth forming into a solid mass. Our present data show the suitability of using the SCID zebrafish strain for xenotransplantation experiments, and in vivo monitoring of the tumor cell growth in the zebrafish demonstrates use of the animal model as a new platform of tumor xenograft study.",

     "abstract": "Metastatic Ewing sarcoma has a very poor prognosis and therefore new investigations into the biologic drivers of metastatic progression are key to finding new therapeutic approaches. The tumor microenvironment is highly dynamic, leading to exposure of different regions of a growing solid tumor to changes in oxygen and nutrient availability. Tumor cells must adapt to such stress in order to survive and propagate. In the current study, we investigate how Ewing sarcoma cells respond to the stress of growth factor deprivation and hypoxia. Our findings reveal that serum deprivation leads to a reversible change in Ewing cell cytoskeletal phenotypes. Using an array of migration and invasion techniques, including gelatin matrix degradation invadopodia assays, we show that exposure of Ewing sarcoma cells to serum deprivation and hypoxia triggers enhanced migration, invadopodia formation, matrix degradation and invasion. Further, these functional changes are accompanied by and dependent on activation of Src kinase. Activation of Src, and the associated invasive cell phenotype, were blocked by exposing hypoxia and serum-deprived cells to the Src inhibitor dasatinib. These results indicate that Ewing sarcoma cells demonstrate significant plasticity in response to rapidly changing micro-environmental stresses that can result from rapid tumor growth and from necrosis-causing therapies. In response to these stresses, Ewing cells transition to a more migratory and invasive state and our data show that Src is an important mediator of this stress response. Our data support exploration of clinically available Src inhibitors as adjuvant agents for metastasis prevention in Ewing sarcoma.",

We performed Sample Set Enrichment Analysis (SSEA) and identified genes associated with low versus high Gleason score in the RNA-seq database. Comparing Gleason 6 versus 9+ PCa samples, we identified 99 differentially expressed genes with variable association to Gleason grade as well as robust expression in prostate cancer. The top-ranked novel lncRNA PCAT14, exhibits both cancer and lineage specificity. On multivariate analysis, low PCAT14 expression independently predicts for BPFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.00126), PSS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.0385), and MFS (P\u00a0=\u00a0.000609), with trends for OS as well (P\u00a0=\u00a0.056). An RNA in-situ hybridization (ISH) assay for PCAT14 distinguished benign vs malignant cases, as well as high vs low Gleason disease. PCAT14 is transcriptionally regulated by AR, and endogenous PCAT14 overexpression suppresses cell invasion. Thus, Using RNA-sequencing data we identify PCAT14, a novel prostate cancer and lineage-specific lncRNA.

     "abstract": "Gastric cancer (GC) remains a malignant disease with high mortality. Patients are frequently diagnosed in advanced stages where survival prognosis is poor. Thus, there is high medical need to find novel drug targets and treatment strategies. Recently, the comprehensive molecular characterization of GC subtypes revealed mutations in the small GTPase RHOA as a hallmark of diffuse-type GC. RHOA activates RHO-associated protein kinases (ROCK1/2) which regulate cell contractility, migration and growth and thus may play a role in cancer. However, therapeutic benefit of RHO-pathway inhibition in GC has not been shown so far. The ROCK1/2 inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinoline sulfonyl)-homopiperazine (HA-1077, fasudil) is approved for cerebrovascular bleeding in patients. We therefore investigated whether fasudil (i.p., 10 mg/kg per day, 4 times per week, 4 weeks) inhibits tumor growth in a preclinical model of GC. Fasudil evoked cell death in human GC cells and reduced the tumor size in the stomach of CEA424-SV40 TAg transgenic mice. Small animal PET/CT confirmed preclinical efficacy. Mass spectrometry imaging identified a translatable biomarker for mouse GC and suggested rapid but incomplete in situ distribution of the drug to gastric tumor tissue. RHOA expression was increased in the neoplastic murine stomach compared with normal non-malignant gastric tissue, and fasudil reduced (auto) phosphorylation of ROCK2 at THR249 in vivo and in human GC cells in vitro. In sum, our data suggest that RHO-pathway inhibition may constitute a novel strategy for treatment of GC and that enhanced distribution of future ROCK inhibitors into tumor tissue may further improve efficacy.",

We report here that NHERF1 acts as a tumor suppressor in vivo for intestinal adenoma development. NHERF1 is highly expressed at the apical membrane of mucosa intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and serosa mesothelial cells. NHERF1-deficient mice show overall longer small intestine and colon that most likely could be attributed to a combination of defects, including altered apical brush border of absorbtive IECs and increased number of secretory IECs. NHERF1 deficiency in ApcMin/+ mice resulted in significantly shorter animal survival due to markedly increased tumor burden. This resulted from a moderate increase of the overall tumor density, more pronounced in females than males, and a massive increase in the number of large adenomas in both genders. The analysis of possible pathways controlling tumor size showed upregulation of Wnt-\u03b2-catenin pathway, higher expression of unphosphorylated YAP, and prominent nuclear expression of cyclin D1 in NHERF1-deficient tumors. Similar YAP changes, with relative decrease of phosphorylated YAP and increase of nuclear YAP expression, were observed as early as the adenoma stages in the progression of human colorectal cancer. This study discusses a complex role of NHERF1 for intestinal morphology and presents indisputable evidence for its in vivo tumor suppressor function upstream of Wnt-\u03b2-catenin and Hippo-YAP pathways.",

We tested the analysis of PE using a multiplexed cytokeratin (CK) panel with targeted mass spectrometry\u2013based quantitation for its rapid classification. CK markers are often assessed in pathological examinations for cancer diagnosis and guiding treatment course. We developed methods to simultaneously quantify 33 CKs in PE using peptide standards for increased analytical specificity and a simple CK enrichment method to detect their low amounts. Analyzing 121 PEs associated with a variety of lung cancers and noncancerous causes, we show that abundance levels of 10 CKs can be related to PE etiology. CK-6, CK-7, CK-8, CK-18, and CK-19 were found at significantly higher levels in cancer-related PEs. Additionally, elevated levels of vimentin and actin differentiated PEs associated with bacterial infections. A classifier algorithm effectively grouped PEs into cancer-related or benign PEs with 81% sensitivity and 79% specificity. A set of undiagnosed PEs showed that our method has potential to shorten PE diagnosis time. For the first time, we show that a cancer-relevant panel of simple-epithelial CK markers currently used in clinical assessment can also be quantitated in PEs. Additionally, while requiring less invasive sampling, our methodology demonstrated a significant ability to identify cancer-related PEs in clinical samples and thus could improve patient care in the future.",

Here, we analyzed the mechanisms of the antitumor effects of aflibercept in mouse hepatoma models. METHODS: In in vitro studies, we determined the effects of aflibercept on human umbilical vein cell (HUVEC) proliferation and bone marrow (BM) cell differentiation to endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs). In in vivo experiments, aflibercept was injected intraperitoneally in hepatoma cell tumor-bearing mice, and its inhibitory effects on tumor growth and BM cell migration to tumor tissues were evaluated. RESULTS: Aflibercept suppressed phosphorylation of VEGF receptor-1 and -2 in HUVEC and dose-dependently inhibited VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation. It suppressed the differentiation of BM cells to EPCs and migration of BM cells to tumor tissues. It also suppressed tumor growth and prolonged survival time of tumor-bearing mice without side effects. In tumor tissues, aflibercept upregulated the expression of hypoxia inducible factor1-\u03b1, VEGF, PlGF, fibroblast growth factor-2, platelet derived growth factor-BB, and transforming growth factor-\u03b1 and reduced microvascular density. It also reduced sinusoidal density in noncancerous liver tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated potent antitumor activity for aflibercept in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These effects were mediated through inhibition of neovascularization, caused by inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation, EPC differentiation, and BM cell migration to tumor tissues.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Extensive cross talk exists between PI3K/Akt/mTOR and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and both are upregulated in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our previous study suggested that epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor erlotinib which acts upstream of these pathways acts synergistically with PI3K inhibitors in PDAC. Horizontal combined blockade upstream and downstream of these two pathways is therefore explored. METHODS: Erlotinib paired with PI3K inhibitor (BYL719) was tested against erlotinib plus dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ-235, and MEK inhibitor (PD98059) plus BEZ235, on five primary PDAC cell lines and on two pairs of parent and erlotinib-resistant (ER) cell lines. A range of in vitro assays including cell proliferation, Western blotting, migration, clonogenic, cell cycle, and apopotic assays was used to test for the efficacy of combined blockade. RESULTS: Dual downstream blockade of the MAPK and PAM pathways was more effective in attenuating downstream molecular signals. Synergy was demonstrated for erlotinib and BEZ235 and for PD-98059 and BEZ-235. This resulted in a trend of increased growth cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and colony and migration suppression. This combination showed more efficacy in cell lines with acquired resistance to erlotinib. CONCLUSIONS: The additional mTOR blockade provided by BEZ235 in combined blockade resulted in increased anticancer effect. The hypersensitivity of ER cell lines to additional mTOR blockade suggested PAM pathway oncogenic dependence via mTOR. Dual downstream combined blockade of MAPK and PAM pathways with MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor appeared most effective and represents an attractive therapeutic strategy against pancreatic cancer and its associated drug resistance.",

In K14-mVEGF-D mice, tumor lymphangiogenesis was significantly increased and the frequency of lymph node metastasis was elevated in comparison with controls. Most notably, the papillomas regressed more often in K14-mVEGF-D mice than in littermate controls, resulting in a delay in tumor incidence and a remarkable reduction in the total tumor number. Skin tumor growth and metastasis were not obviously affected in the absence of VEGF-D; however, the knockout mice showed a trend for reduced lymphangiogenesis in skin tumors and in the untreated skin. Interestingly, K14-mVEGF-D mice showed an altered immune response in skin tumors. This consisted of the reduced accumulation of macrophages, mast cells, and CD4+ T-cells and an increase of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells. Cytokine profiling by flow cytometry and quantitative real time PCR revealed that elevated VEGF-D expression results in an attenuated Th2 response and promotes M1/Th1 and Th17 polarization in the early stage of skin carcinogenesis, leading to an anti-tumoral immune environment and the regression of primary tumors. Our data suggest that VEGF-D may be beneficial in early-stage tumors since it suppresses the pro-tumorigenic inflammation, while at later stages VEGF-D-induced tumor lymphatics provide a route for metastasis.",

The pancreatic stellate cell (PSC) is the major cellular stromal component and the main producer of extracellular matrix proteins, including collagens, which are degraded by metalloproteinases (MMPs). PSCs interact with cancer cells through various factors, including transforming growth factor (TGF)\u03b2 and interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1. The role of TGF\u03b2 in the dual nature of tumor stroma, i.e., protumorigenic or tumor suppressive, is not clear. We aimed to investigate the roles of TGF\u03b2 and IL-1\u03b1 in the regulation of MMP profiles in PSCs and the subsequent effects on cancer cell migration. Human PSCs isolated from surgically resected specimens were cultured in the presence of pancreatic cancer cell lines, as well as IL-1\u03b1 or TGF\u03b2. MMP production and activities in PSCs were quantified by gene array transcripts, mRNA measurements, fluorescence resonance energy transfer\u2013based activity assay, and zymography. PSC-conditioned media and pancreatic cancer cells were included in a collagen matrix cell migration model. We found that production of IL-1\u03b1 by pancreatic cancer cells induced alterations in MMP and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase (TIMP) profiles and activities in PSCs, upregulated expression and activation of MMP1 and MMP3, and enhanced migration of pancreatic cancer cells in the collagen matrix model. TGF\u03b2 counteracted the effects of IL-1\u03b1 on PSCs, reestablished PSC MMP and TIMP profiles and activities, and inhibited migration of cancer cells. This suggests that tumor TGF\u03b2 has a role as a suppressor of stromal promotion of tumor progression through alterations in PSC MMP profiles with subsequent inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell migration.",

We recently demonstrated the neoplastic potential of gastroduodenal fluids (GDF) on hypopharyngeal mucosa, via NF-\u03baB, using in vitro and in vivo models. Here we will explore the in vivo effect of GDF on laryngeal mucosa (LM) to induce early preneoplastic lesions related to NF-\u03baB activation, along with deregulation of specific microRNA (miRNA) markers previously linked to laryngeal cancer. We used histological, immunohistochemical, automated quantitative analysis and quantitative polymerase chain reaction to examine LM from 35 C57Bl/6J mice previously treated with topical GDF against corresponding controls (4 experimental and 3 control groups; 5 mice/group). Our analysis showed that GDF produced early preneoplastic lesions in treated LM related to NF-\u03baB activation. LM treated by acid and bile combination demonstrated significantly higher expression of the analyzed cell proliferation markers (Ki67, CK14, \u2206Np63), oncogenic p-STAT3, and changes of cell adhesion molecules (E-cadherin, \u03d0-catenin) versus untreated LM or LM exposed to acid alone (P < .0005).

Finally, acidic bile induced reduction of miR-34a, miR-375, and miR-451a, exhibiting an inverse correlation with NF-\u03baB activation. SIGNIFICANCE: Bile in combination with acid has a selective tumorigenic effect on LM, inducing deregulation of \u201concomirs\u201d and tumor suppressor miRNAs, produced by NF-\u03baB activation with molecular and early histopathological alterations linked to neoplastic transformation.

It is located at 3p21, one copy of which is lost in the majority of ccRCC tumors, suggesting that SETD2 might function as a tumor suppressor gene. However, the manner in which loss of SETD2 contributes to ccRCC development has not been studied in renal primary tubular epithelial cells (PTECs). Therefore, we studied the consequences of SETD2 knockdown through lentiviral shRNA in human PTECs. Consistent with its known function, SETD2 knockdown (SETD-KD) led to loss of H3K36me3 in PTECs. In contrast to SETD2 wild-type PTECs, which have a limited proliferation capacity; the SETD2-KD PTECs continued to proliferate. The expression profiles of SETD2-KD PTECs showed a large overlap with the expression profile of early-passage, proliferating PTECs, whereas nonproliferating PTECs showed a significantly different expression profile. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a significant enrichment of E2F targets in SETD2-KD and proliferating PTECs as compared with nonproliferating PTECs and in proliferating PTEC compared with SETD2-KD. The SETD2-KD PTECs maintained low expression of CDKN2A and high expression of E2F1, whereas their levels changed with continuing passages in untreated PTECs. In contrast to the nonproliferating PTECs, SETD2-KD PTECs showed no \u03b2-galactosidase staining, confirming the protection against senescence. Our results indicate that SETD2 inactivation enables PTECs to bypass the senescence barrier, facilitating a malignant transformation toward ccRCC.",

     "abstract": "Enhanced autophagy has been observed in hypoxic regions of solid tumors. Here we address the hypothesis that autophagy is required for survival of hypoxic cells. We evaluated sensitivity to hypoxia of three human tumor cell lines (MCF7, PC3, and LNCaP) and their autophagy-deficient variants with shRNA knockdown of the genes ATG7 and BECLIN1. Hypoxia-induced cell death was more rapid for autophagy-deficient cells and was increased in the presence of the proton pump inhibitor pantoprazole that inhibits autophagy. Autophagy-deficient cells had a lower rate of oxygen consumption than wild-type cells. In xenografts derived from the three cell lines, autophagy (as determined by increased LC3 and reduced p62/SQSTM1) colocalized with hypoxic regions (identified by EF5). Xenografts derived from autophagy-deficient cells grew more slowly than wild-type tumors. Both LC3 expression and hypoxia were decreased in xenografts generated from single-knockdown cells and absent in double-knockdown tumors. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that autophagy facilitates the survival of hypoxic cells, although reduced oxygen consumption of autophagy-deficient cells may contribute to lack of hypoxia in tumors derived from them. Because hypoxia is associated with resistance to anticancer therapy, inhibition of autophagy has potential to enhance the effectiveness of cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNA (miRNA) deregulation in prostate cancer (PCa) contributes to PCa initiation and metastatic progression. To comprehensively define the cancer-associated changes in miRNA targeting and function in commonly studied models of PCa, we performed photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking immunoprecipitation of the Argonaute protein in a panel of PCa cell lines modeling different stages of PCa progression. Using this comprehensive catalogue of miRNA targets, we analyzed miRNA targeting on known drivers of PCa and examined tissue-specific and stage-specific pathway targeting by miRNAs. We found that androgen receptor is the most frequently targeted PCa oncogene and that miR-148a targets the largest number of known PCa drivers. Globally, tissue-specific and stage-specific changes in miRNA targeting are driven by homeostatic response to active oncogenic pathways. Our findings indicate that, even in advanced PCa, the miRNA pool adapts to regulate continuing alterations in the cancer genome to balance oncogenic molecular changes. These findings are important because they are the first to globally characterize miRNA changes in PCa and demonstrate how the miRNA target spectrum responds to staged tumorigenesis.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is globally the second most common cause of cancer mortality. The majority of HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stage disease for which no curative treatments exist. TGF-\u03b2 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. However, the molecular mechanisms mediating its functional switch from a tumor suppressor to tumor promoter in HCC and its interactions with other signaling pathways are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate an aberrant molecular network between the TGF-\u03b2 and c-KIT pathway that mediates the functional switch of TGF-\u03b2 to a driver of tumor progression in HCC. TGF-\u03b2/SMAD2 signaling transcriptionally regulates expression of the c-KIT receptor ligand (stem cell factor [SCF]) with subsequent auto- and paracrine activation of c-KIT/JAK1/STAT3 signaling. SCF induces TGF-\u03b21 ligand expression via STAT3, thereby forming a positive feedback loop between TGF-\u03b2/SMAD and SCF/c-KIT signaling. This network neutralizes TGF-\u03b2\u2013mediated cell cycle inhibition and induces tumor cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition, migration, and invasion. Disruption of this feedback loop inhibits TGF-\u03b2 tumor-promoting effects and restores its antiproliferative functions. Consistent with our in vitro data, we demonstrate SCF overexpression and its correlation to SMAD2 and STAT3 activation in human HCC tumors, advanced tumor-node-metastasis stages, and shorter survival. CONCLUSIONS: Canonical TGF-\u03b2 and c-KIT signaling forms a positive, tumor-promoting feedback loop. Disruption of this loop restores TGF-\u03b2 tumor suppressor function and provides the rationale for targeting the TGF-\u03b2/SCF axis as a novel therapeutic strategy for HCC.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: A novel quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method, namely, temporal diffusion spectroscopy (TDS), was used to detect the response of tumor cells (notably, mitotic arrest) to a specific antimitotic treatment (Nab-paclitaxel) in culture and human ovarian xenografts and evaluated as an early imaging biomarker of tumor responsiveness. METHODS: TDS measures a series of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) of tissue water over a range of effective diffusion times, which may correspond to diffusion distances ranging from subcellular to cellular levels (~\u00a03-20 \u03bcm). By fitting the measured ADC data to a tissue model, parameters reflecting structural properties such as restriction size in solid tumors can be extracted. Two types of human ovarian cell lines (OVCAR-8 as a responder to Nab-paclitaxel and NCI/ADR-RES as a resistant type) were treated with either vehicle (PBS) or Nab-paclitaxel, and treatment responses of both in vitro and in vivo cases were investigated using TDS. RESULTS: Acute cell size increases induced by Nab-paclitaxel in responding tumors were confirmed by flow cytometry and light microscopy in cell culture. Nab-paclitaxel\u2013induced mitotic arrest in treated tumors/cells was quantified histologically by measuring the mitotic index in vivo using a mitosis-specific marker (anti-phosphohistone H3). Changes in the fitted restriction size, one of the parameters obtained from TDS, were able to detect and quantify increases in tumor cell sizes. All the MR results had a high degree of consistency with other flow, microscopy, and histological data. Moreover, with an appropriate analysis, the Nab-paclitaxel\u2013responsive tumors in vivo could be easily distinguished from all the other vehicle-treated and Nab-paclitaxel\u2013resistant tumors. CONCLUSION: TDS detects increases in cell sizes associated with antimitotic-therapy\u2013induced mitotic arrest in solid tumors in vivo which occur before changes in tissue cellularity or conventional diffusion MRI metrics. By quantifying changes in cell size, TDS has the potential to improve the specificity of MRI methods in the evaluation of therapeutic response and enable a mechanistic understanding of therapy-induced changes in tumors.",

We previously suggested that polypeptide N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 6 (GALNT6), which catalyzes O-type glycosylation of Mucin 1, might be a promising molecular target for drug development for breast cancer. In this study, we report upregulation of GALNT6 in pancreatic cancer cells where Mucin proteins are highly O-glycosylated. We found that knockdown of GALNT6 with small interfering RNA in pancreatic cancer cells decreased the amount of Mucin 4 protein as well as that of its transcript, reduced the levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase, and significantly reduced pancreatic cancer cell viability. Interestingly, knockdown of GALNT6 caused drastic morphological changes of pancreatic cells, accompanied with the cadherin switching from P-cadherin to E-cadherin. Considering important roles of Mucin 4 in growth and invasion, our findings imply that targeting GALNT6 is a very promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of pancreatic cancer patients who still have very limited treatment modalities.",

We have recently shown that IL-6 enhances the survival and tumorigenic potential of head and neck cancer stem cells (i.e. ALDHhighCD44high cells). Here, we characterized the effect of therapeutic inhibition of IL-6 with a novel humanized anti-IL-6 antibody (MEDI5117) using three low-passage patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of HNSCC. We observed that single agent MEDI5117 inhibited the growth of PDX-SCC-M1 tumors (P < .05). This PDX model was generated from a previously untreated HNSCC. In contrast, MEDI5117 was not effective at reducing overall tumor volume for PDX models representing resistant disease (PDX-SCC-M0, PDX-SCC-M11). Low dose MEDI5117 (3 mg/kg) consistently decreased the fraction of cancer stem cells in PDX models of HNSCC when compared to IgG-treated controls, as follows: PDX-SCC-M0 (P < .001), PDX-SCC-M1 (P < .001), PDX-SCC-M11 (P = .04). Interestingly, high dose MEDI5117 (30 mg/kg) decreased the CSC fraction in the PDX-SCC-M11 model (P = .002), but not in PDX-SCC-M0 and PDX-SCC-M1. MEDI5117 mediated a dose-dependent decrease in the number of orospheres generated by ALDHhighCD44high cells cultured in ultra-low attachment plates (P < .05), supporting an inhibitory effect on head and neck cancer stem cells. Notably, single agent MEDI5117 reduced the overall recurrence rate of PDX-SCC-M0, a PDX generated from the local recurrence of human HNSCC.

Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that integrates cytoskeleton remodeling, mitogenic signaling and cell survival. FAK has previously been reported to undergo nuclear localization during cell migration, cell differentiation and apoptosis. However, the mechanism behind FAK nuclear accumulation and its contribution to tumor progression has remained elusive. We report that amplification of FAK and the SUMO E3 ligase PIAS1 gene loci frequently co-occur in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and that both gene products are enriched in a subset of primary NSCLCs. We demonstrate that endogenous FAK and PIAS1 proteins interact in the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus of NSCLC cells. Ectopic expression of PIAS1 promotes proteolytic cleavage of the FAK C-terminus, focal adhesion maturation and FAK nuclear localization. Silencing of PIAS1 deregulates focal adhesion turnover, increases susceptibility to apoptosis in vitro and impairs tumor xenograft formation in vivo. Nuclear FAK in turn stimulates gene transcription favoring DNA repair, cell metabolism and cytoskeleton regulation. Consistently, ablation of FAK by CRISPR/Cas9 editing, results in basal DNA damage, susceptibility to ionizing radiation and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. Our findings provide insight into a mechanism regulating FAK cytoplasm-nuclear distribution and demonstrate that FAK activity in the nucleus promotes NSCLC survival and progression by increasing cell-ECM interaction and DNA repair regulation.",

However, little is known regarding the genetic and functional importance of glycan chains displayed by proteoglycans on dendritic cells (DCs) in cancer immunity. In lung carcinoma, among other solid tumors, tumor-associated DCs play largely subversive/suppressive roles, promoting tumor growth and progression. Herein, we show that targeting of DC glycan sulfation through mutation in the heparan sulfate biosynthetic enzyme N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase-1 (Ndst1) in mice increased DC maturation and inhibited trafficking of DCs to draining lymph nodes. Lymphatic-driven DC migration and chemokine (CCL21)-dependent activation of a major signaling pathway required for DC migration (as measured by phospho-Akt) were sensitive to Ndst1 mutation in DCs. Lewis lung carcinoma tumors in mice deficient in Ndst1 were reduced in size. Purified CD11c\u00a0+ cells from the tumors, which contain the tumor-infiltrating DC population, showed a similar phenotype in mutant cells. These features were replicated in mice deficient in syndecan-4, the major heparan sulfate proteoglycan expressed on the DC surface: Tumors were growth-impaired in syndecan-4\u2013deficient mice and were characterized by increased infiltration by mature DCs. Tumors on the mutant background also showed greater infiltration by NK cells and NKT cells. These findings indicate the genetic importance of DC heparan sulfate proteoglycans in tumor growth and may guide therapeutic development of novel strategies to target syndecan-4 and heparan sulfate in cancer.",

These chronic infections increase the risk of several gastrointestinal diseases, including cancer. Salmonella AvrA is a multifunctional protein that influences eukaryotic cell pathways by regulating ubiquitination and acetylation. In an animal model, we have demonstrated that infection with AvrA-expressing Salmonella induces beta-catenin signals and enhances colonic tumorigenesis. Beta-catenin signaling is a key player in intestinal proliferation and tumorigenesis. The relative contributions of AvrA-induced proliferation and inflammation on tumorigenesis, however, are unknown. STAT3 is activated in chronically inflamed intestines in human inflammatory bowel diseases and in colitis-associated colon cancer. In the current study, mice were colonized with Salmonella AvrA-sufficient or AvrA-deficient bacterial strains. Then, inflammation-associated colon cancer was induced through the use of azoxymethane/dextran sulfate sodium. We determined that AvrA-expressing bacteria activated the STAT3 pathway, which is predicted to enhance proliferation and promote tumorigenesis. Transcriptional activity of STAT3 and its target genes were upregulated by Salmonella expressing AvrA, thus promoting proliferation and intestinal tumorigenesis. Our findings provide new insights regarding a STAT3-dependent mechanism by which the specific bacterial product AvrA enhances the development of infection-associated colon cancer.

It facilitates the escape of cells from oncogene-induced fail-safe programs (senescence, apoptosis) and their consequent neoplastic transformation. Additionally, it promotes the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and the initiation of the metastatic spread of cancer cells. Interestingly, cancer cells recurrently remain dependent on TWIST1 for their survival and/or proliferation, making TWIST1 their Achilles\u2019 heel. TWIST1 has been reported to form either homodimeric or heterodimeric complexes mainly in association with the E bHLH class I proteins. These complexes display distinct, sometimes even antagonistic, functions during development and unequal prometastatic functions in prostate cancer cells. Using a tethered dimer strategy, we successively assessed the ability of TWIST1 dimers to cooperate with an activated version of RAS in human mammary epithelial cell transformation, to provide mice with the ability to spontaneously develop breast tumors, and lastly to maintain a senescence program at a latent state in several breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrate that the TWIST1-E12 complex, unlike the homodimer, is an oncogenic form of TWIST1 in mammary epithelial cells and that efficient binding of both partners is a prerequisite for its activity. The detection of the heterodimer in human premalignant lesions by a proximity ligation assay, at a stage preceding the initiation of the metastatic cascade, is coherent with such an oncogenic function. TWIST1-E protein heterodimeric complexes may thus constitute the main active forms of TWIST1 with regard to senescence inhibition over the time course of breast tumorigenesis.",

An in vitro cytotoxicity assay revealed that BO-1978 significantly suppressed the growth of various NSCLC cell lines with or without mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Mechanistically, we demonstrated that BO-1978 exhibited multiple modes of action, including inhibition of topoisomerase I/II and induction of DNA cross-linking. Treatment of NSCLC cells with BO-1978 caused DNA damage, disturbed cell cycle progression, and triggered apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, BO-1978 significantly suppressed the growth of EGFR wild-type and mutant NSCLC tumors in xenograft tumor and orthotopic lung tumor models with negligible body weight loss. The combination of BO-1978 with gefitinib further suppressed EGFR mutant NSCLC cell growth in xenograft tumor and orthotopic lung tumor models.

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: Increased murine double minute 2 (MDM2) expression, independent of p53 status, is associated with increased cancer-specific mortality for men with prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy. We assessed MI-219, a small molecule inhibitor of MDM2 with improved pharmacokinetics over nutlin-3, for sensitization of prostate cancer cells to radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy, a standard treatment option for men with high-risk prostate cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The effect of MDM2 inhibition by MI-219 was assessed in vitro and in vivo with mouse xenograft models across multiple prostate cancer cell lines containing varying p53 functional status. RESULTS: MDM2 inhibition by MI-219 resulted in dose- and time-dependent p53 activation and decreased clonogenic cell survival after radiation in a p53-dependent manner. Mechanistically, radiosensitization following inhibition of MDM2 was largely the result of p53-dependent increases in apoptosis and DNA damage as evidenced by Annexin V flow cytometry and \u03b3-H2AX foci immunofluorescence. Similarly, treatment with MI-219 enhanced response to antiandrogen therapy via a p53-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death. Lastly, triple therapy with radiation, androgen deprivation therapy, and MI-219 decreased xenograft tumor growth compared with any single- or double-agent treatment. CONCLUSION: MDM2 inhibition with MI-219 results in p53-dependent sensitization of prostate cancer cells to radiation, antiandrogen therapy, and the combination. These findings support MDM2 small molecule inhibitor therapy as a therapy intensification strategy to improve clinical outcomes in high-risk localized prostate cancer. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The combination of radiotherapy and androgen deprivation therapy is a standard treatment option for men with high-risk prostate cancer. Despite improvements in outcomes when androgen deprivation therapy is added to radiation, men with high-risk prostate cancer have significant risk for disease recurrence, progression, and even death within the first 10 years following treatment. We demonstrate that treatment with MI-219 (an inhibitor of MDM2) results in prostate cancer cell sensitization to radiation and androgen deprivation therapy in vitro and in vivo. Triple therapy with MI-219, radiation, and androgen deprivation therapy dramatically decreased tumor growth compared with any single- or double-agent therapy. These findings provide evidence that inhibition of MDM2 is a viable means by which to enhance the efficacy of both radiation and androgen deprivation therapy and thereby improve outcomes in the treatment of prostate cancer. As such, further investigation is warranted to translate these findings to the clinical setting.",

Recent genome sequencing studies have led to the identification of novel phenomena called chromothripsis and chromoanasynthesis in which complex genomic rearrangements are thought to be derived from a single catastrophic event rather than by several incremental steps. A new term chromoanagenesis or chromosomal rebirth was coined recently to group these two one-step catastrophic events together. These phenomena suggest an evolutionary modality for cancer cells to circumvent individual mutational events with one simultaneous shattering of chromosomes resulting in the random reassembling of segmented genetic material to form complex derivative chromosomes. We report a case of possible chromoanagenesis in a patient with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Chromosome analysis from the biopsy showed a complex karyotype with multiple numerical and structural rearrangements including a translocation of chromosomes 3 and 7 involving the BCL6 gene region, with the derivative chromosome further rearranging with chromosomes 14, 7, and 22 with involvement of the IGH gene region. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies confirmed these findings. Chromosomal microarray studies showed multiple complex copy number variations including a chromosome 12 abnormality, the complexity of which appears to suggest the phenomenon of chromoanagenesis. Our case further illustrates that lymphomagenesis can be complex and may arise from a catastrophic event resulting in multiple complex chromosome rearrangements.",

Although CD200S is reported to antagonize the immunosuppressive actions of CD200L, the role of CD200S in tumor immunity has never been investigated. We established rat C6 glioma cell lines that expressed either CD200L or CD200S; the original C6 cell line did not express CD200 molecules. The cell lines showed no significant differences in growth. Upon transplantation into the neonatal Wistar rat forebrain parenchyma, rats transplanted with C6-CD200S cells survived for a significantly longer period than those transplanted with the original C6 and C6-CD200L cells. The C6-CD200S tumors were smaller than the C6-CD200L or C6-original tumors, and many apoptotic cells were found in the tumor cell aggregates. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in C6-CD200S tumors displayed dendritic cell (DC)-like morphology with multiple processes and CD86 expression. Furthermore, CD3+, CD4+ or CD8+ cells were more frequently found in C6-CD200S tumors, and the expression of DC markers, granzyme, and perforin was increased in C6-CD200S tumors. Isolated TAMs from original C6 tumors were co-cultured with C6-CD200S cells and showed increased expression of DC markers. These results suggest that CD200S activates TAMs to become DC-like antigen presenting cells, leading to the activation of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which induce apoptotic elimination of tumor cells. The findings on CD200S action may provide a novel therapeutic modality for the treatment of carcinomas.",

Here we revealed that Lon protease (Lonp1), which is a key inductive of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt) and is required to maintain the mitochondrial quality, was greatly induced in H. pylori infected gastric epithelial cells. Importantly, we uncovered that knockdown of Lonp1 expression significantly diminished the metabolic switch to glycolysis and gastric cell proliferation associated with low multiplicity of H. pylori infection. In addition, Lonp1 overexpression in gastric epithelial cells also promoted glycolytic switch and cell overgrowth, suggesting H. pylori effect is Lonp1 dependent. We further demonstrated that H. pylori induced Lonp1 expression and cell overgrowth, at least partially, via HIF-1\u03b1 regulation.

As an approach to aid interpretation of the DC results, the mutations were also quantified in normal breast tissue. Overall, the mutations were prevalent in normal breast and DCs, with 9/9 DCs having measureable levels of at least three of the five mutations. HRAS G12D was significantly increased in DCs as compared to normal breast. The most frequent point mutation reported in DC by DNA sequencing, PIK3CA H1047R, was detected in all normal breast tissue and DC samples and was present at remarkably high levels (mutant fractions of 1.1 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a03 to 4.6 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a02) in 4/10 normal breast samples.

The results suggest PIK3CA H1047R mutant cells have a selective advantage in breast, contribute to breast cancer susceptibility, and drive tumor progression during breast carcinogenesis, even when present as only a subpopulation of tumor cells.",

Murine macrophage Raw264.7 cells expressing an enhanced firefly luciferase (Raw/effluc) and murine colon cancer CT26 cells coexpressing Rluc and mCherry (CT26/Rluc-mCherry, CT26/RM) were established. CT26/RM tumor-bearing mice received Raw/effluc via their tail veins, and combination of bioluminescence imaging (BLI) and fluorescence imaging (FLI) was conducted for in vivo imaging of TAMs migration and tumor progression. Dexamethasone (DEX), a potent anti-inflammatory drug, was administered intraperitoneally to tumor-bearing mice following the intravenous transfer of Raw/effluc cells. The migration of TAMs and tumor growth was monitored by serial FLI and BLI. The migration of Raw/effluc cells to tumor lesions was observed at day 1, and BLI signals were still distinct at tumor lesions on day 4. Localization of BLI signals from migrated Raw/effluc cells corresponded to that of FLI signals from CT26/RM tumors. In vivo FLI of tumors demonstrated enhanced tumor growth associated with macrophage migration to tumor lesions. Treatment with DEX inhibited the influx of Raw/effluc cells to tumor lesions and abolished the enhanced tumor growth associated with macrophage migration. These findings suggest that molecular imaging approach for TAM tracking is a valuable tool for evaluating the role of TAMs in the tumor microenvironment as well as for the development of new drugs to control TAM involvement in the modulation of tumor progression.",

Activated fibroblasts are a prevalent component of the stroma, and traditionally, these cells have been considered as a homogenous population derived from pancreatic stellate cells. In this study, we highlight a previously unappreciated heterogeneity of the fibroblast population within the stroma. In particular, a subset of stromal fibroblasts has characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are present in the normal pancreas as well as in the carcinomatous pancreas (CA-MSCs). Here, we determine that CA-MSCs have increased tumor-promoting function compared with MSCs in normal pancreas. This ability to promote tumor growth is associated with CA-MSCs\u2019 unique ability to promote alternative macrophage polarization. Thus, our study identifies a previously uncharacterized cell population within the stroma and sheds light on tumor-promoting interactions between different components of the stroma.Targeting the stroma is emerging as a new paradigm in pancreatic cancer; however, efforts to that effect are hampered by our limited understanding of the nature and function of stromal components. Here, we uncover previously unappreciated heterogeneity within the stroma and identify interactions among stromal components that promote tumor growth and could be targeted therapeutically.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer generally metastasizes to bone, and most patients have tumor cells in their bone marrow already at diagnosis. Tumor cells at the metastatic site may therefore progress in parallel with those in the primary tumor. Androgen deprivation therapy is often the first-line treatment for clinically detectable prostate cancer bone metastases. Although the treatment is effective, most metastases progress to a castration-resistant and lethal state. To examine metastatic progression in the bone microenvironment, we implanted androgen-sensitive, androgen receptor\u2013positive, and relatively slow-growing Dunning G (G) rat prostate tumor cells into the tibial bone marrow of fully immune-competent Copenhagen rats. We show that tumor establishment in the bone marrow was reduced compared with the prostate, and whereas androgen deprivation did not affect tumor establishment or growth in the bone, this was markedly reduced in the prostate. Moreover, we found that, with time, G tumor cells in the bone microenvironment progress to a more aggressive phenotype with increased growth rate, reduced androgen sensitivity, and increased metastatic capacity. Tumor cells in the bone marrow encounter lower androgen levels and a higher degree of hypoxia than at the primary site, which may cause high selective pressures and eventually contribute to the development of a new and highly aggressive tumor cell phenotype. It is therefore important to specifically study progression in bone metastases. This tumor model could be used to increase our understanding of how tumor cells adapt in the bone microenvironment and may subsequently improve therapy strategies for prostate metastases in bone.",

Alectinib and ceritinib are second-generation ALK inhibitors which show remarkable clinical responses in both crizotinib-naive and crizotinib-resistant NSCLC patients harboring an ALK fusion gene. Despite their impressive activity, clinical resistance to alectinib and ceritinib has also emerged. In the current study, we elucidated the resistance mechanisms to these second-generation ALK inhibitors in the H3122 NSCLC cell line harboring the EML4-ALK variant 1 fusion in vitro. Prolonged treatment of the parental H3122 cells with alectinib and ceritinib led to two cell lines which are 10 times less sensitive to alectinib and ceritinib than the parental H3122 cell line. Although mutations of ALK in its kinase domain are a common resistance mechanism for crizotinib, we did not detect any ALK mutation in these resistant cell lines. Rather, overexpression of phospho-ALK and alternative receptor tyrosine kinases such as phospho-EGFR, phospho-HER3, and phospho-IGFR-1R was observed in both resistant cell lines. Additionally, NRG1, a ligand for HER3, is upregulated and responsible for resistance by activating the EGFR family pathways through the NRG1-HER3-EGFR axis. Combination treatment with EGFR inhibitors, in particular afatinib, was shown to be effective at overcoming resistance. Our study provides new mechanistic insights into adaptive resistance to second-generation ALK inhibitors and suggests a potential clinical strategy to combat resistance to these second-generation ALK inhibitors in NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "The current paradigm of pancreatic neoplastic transformation proposes an initial step whereby acinar cells convert into acinar-to-ductal metaplasias, followed by progression of these lesions into neoplasias under sustained oncogenic activity and inflammation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving these processes is crucial to the early diagnostic and prevention of pancreatic cancer. Emerging evidence indicates that transcription factors that control exocrine pancreatic development could have either, protective or facilitating roles in the formation of preneoplasias and neoplasias in the pancreas. We previously identified that the homeodomain transcription factor Prox1 is a novel regulator of mouse exocrine pancreas development. Here we investigated whether Prox1 function participates in early neoplastic transformation using in vivo, in vitro and in silico approaches. We found that Prox1 expression is transiently re-activated in acinar cells undergoing dedifferentiation and acinar-to-ductal metaplastic conversion. In contrast, Prox1 expression is largely absent in neoplasias and tumors in the pancreas of mice and humans. We also uncovered that Prox1-heterozygosis markedly increases the formation of acinar-to-ductal-metaplasias and early neoplasias, and enhances features associated with inflammation, in mouse pancreatic tissues expressing oncogenic Kras. Furthermore, we discovered that Prox1-heterozygosis increases tissue damage and delays recovery from inflammation in pancreata of mice injected with caerulein. These results are the first demonstration that Prox1 activity protects pancreatic cells from acute tissue damage and early neoplastic transformation. Additional data in our study indicate that this novel role of Prox1 involves suppression of pathways associated with inflammatory responses and cell invasiveness.",

Understanding the mechanisms supporting GSC stemness is important for developing therapeutic strategies for targeting GSC-dependent oncogenic mechanisms. Using GBM-derived neurospheres, we identified the cell surface tetraspanin family member CD151 as a novel regulator of glioma cell stemness, GSC self-renewal capacity, migration, and tumor growth. CD151 was found to be overexpressed in GBM tumors and GBM neurospheres enriched in GSCs. Silencing CD151 inhibited neurosphere forming capacity, neurosphere cell proliferation, and migration and attenuated the expression of markers and transcriptional drivers of the GSC phenotype. Conversely, forced CD151 expression promoted neurosphere self-renewal, cell migration, and expression of stemness-associated transcription factors. CD151 was found to complex with integrins \u03b13, \u03b16, and \u03b21 in neurosphere cells, and blocking CD151 interactions with integrins \u03b13 and \u03b16 inhibited AKT phosphorylation, a downstream effector of integrin signaling, and impaired sphere formation and neurosphere cell migration.

Variable tumor histology and the identification of tumor subsets displaying different gene expression profiles suggest that tumors may arise at different stages of mesenchyme differentiation and that this ontogenic variability impacts tumor pathology, biology, and clinical outcome. To test the tumorigenic potential of different cell types in the developing kidney, we used kidney progenitor-specific Cre recombinase alleles to introduce Wt1 and Ctnnb1 mutations, two alterations observed in Wilms tumor, into embryonic mouse kidney, with and without biallelic Igf2 expression, another alteration that is observed in a majority of tumors. Use of a Cre allele that targets nephron progenitors to introduce a Ctnnb1 mutation that stabilizes \u03b2-catenin resulted in the development of tumors with a predominant epithelial histology and a gene expression profile in which genes characteristic of early renal mesenchyme were not expressed. Nephron progenitors with Wt1 ablation and Igf2 biallelic expression were also tumorigenic but displayed a more triphasic histology and expressed early metanephric mesenchyme genes. In contrast, the targeting of these genetic alterations to stromal progenitors did not result in tumors. These data demonstrate that committed nephron progenitors can give rise to Wilms tumors and that committed stromal progenitors are less tumorigenic, suggesting that human Wilms tumors that display a predominantly stromal histology arise from mesenchyme before commitment to a stromal lineage.",

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) signaling regulates key translation mediators to modulate protein synthesis (e.g. eIF4E, 4E-BP1, mTOR, and S6K1). Importantly the Amplified in Breast Cancer (AIB1) oncogene regulates transcription and is also a downstream mediator of IGF-I signaling.To determine if AIB1 also affects mRNA translation, we conducted gain and loss of AIB1 function experiments in estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1)+ (MCF-7L) and ER\u03b1- (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435 and LCC6) breast cancer cells.AIB1 positively regulated IGF-I-induced mRNA translation in both ER\u03b1+ and ER\u03b1- cells. Formation of the eIF4E-4E-BP1 translational complex was altered in the AIB1 ER\u03b1+ and ER\u03b1- knockdown cells, leading to a reduction in the eIF4E/4E-BP1 and eIF4G/4E-BP1 ratios. In basal and IGF-I stimulated MCF-7 and LCC6 cells, knockdown of AIB1 decreased the integrity of the cap-binding complex, reduced global IGF-I stimulated polyribosomal mRNA recruitment with a concomitant decrease in ten of the thirteen genes tested in polysome-bound mRNAs mapping to proliferation, cell cycle, survival, transcription, translation and ribosome biogenesis ontologies. Specifically, knockdown of AIB1 decreased ribosome-bound mRNA and steady-state protein levels of the transcription factors ER\u03b1 and E2F1 in addition to reduced ribosome-bound mRNA of the ribosome biogenesis factor BYSL in a cell-line specific manner to regulate mRNA translation.The oncogenic transcription factor AIB1 has a novel role in the regulation of polyribosome recruitment and formation of the translational complex. Combinatorial therapies targeting IGF signaling and mRNA translation in AIB1 expressing breast cancers may have clinical benefit and warrants further investigation.",

In this study, we established the biological and functional significance of ezrin-EGFR interaction in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Endogenous ezrin and EGRF interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent staining. When expression of ezrin was inhibited, EGFR activity and phosphorylation levels of downstream signaling pathway proteins ERK and STAT3 were decreased. Cell fractionation experiments revealed that nuclear EGFR was significantly diminished in ezrin-knockdown cells. Consequently, mRNA levels of EGFR target genes AURKA, COX-2, cyclin D1, and iNOS were decreased in ezrin-depleted cells. A small molecule inhibitor of ezrin, NSC305787, reduced EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and downstream target proteins, EGFR nuclear translocation, and mRNA levels of nuclear EGFR target genes similar to ezrin suppression. NSC305787 showed synergism with erlotinib in wild-type EGFR-expressing NSCLC cells, whereas no synergy was observed in EGFR-null cells. Phosphorylation of ezrin on Y146 was found as an enhancer of ezrin-EGFR interaction and required for increased proliferation, colony formation, and drug resistance to erlotinib. These findings suggest that ezrin-EGFR interaction augments oncogenic functions of EGFR and that targeting ezrin may provide a potential novel approach to overcome erlotinib resistance in NSCLC cells.",

In view of this we have used an integrated systems biology approach to analyze 471 cases of skin cutaneous melanoma (SKCM) in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for mutations and amplifications of EZH2. Identified changes in target genes were validated by interrogation of microarray data from melanoma cells treated with the EZH2 inhibitor GSK126. We found that EZH2 activation by mutations, gene amplification and increased transcription occurred in about 20% of the cohort. These alterations were associated with significant hypermethylation of DNA and significant downregulation of 11% of transcripts in patient RNASeq data. GSK126 treatment of melanoma lines containing EZH2 activation reversed such transcriptional repression in 98 candidate target genes. Gene enrichment analysis revealed genes associated with tumor suppression, cell differentiation, cell cycle inhibition and repression of metastases as well as antigen processing and presentation pathways.

As previous work supports negative regulation of MET by AR signaling, we hypothesized that intact AR signaling may have limited the efficacy of cabozantinib in some of these patients. To assess the role of AR signaling on MET inhibition, we first performed an in silico analysis of human CRPC tissue samples stratified by AR signaling status (+ or \u2212), which identified MET expression as markedly increased in AR\u2212 samples. In vitro, AR signaling inhibition in AR+ CRPC models increased MET expression and resulted in susceptibility to ligand (HGF) activation. Likewise, MET inhibition was only effective in blocking cancer phenotypes in cells with MET overexpression. Using multiple AR+ CRPC in vitro and in vivo models, we showed that combined cabozantinib and enzalutamide (AR antagonist) treatment was more efficacious than either inhibitor alone. These data provide a compelling rationale to combine AR and MET inhibition in CRPC and may explain the negative results of the phase III cabozantinib study in CRPC. Similarly, the expression of MET in AR\u2212 disease, whether due to AR inhibition or loss of AR signaling, suggests potential utility for MET inhibition in select patients with AR therapy resistance and in AR\u2212 prostate cancer.",

In the recent years, it was shown that its implication in cancer goes well beyond the sole role of YAP transcriptional activity and its regulation by the canonical MST/LATS kinase cascade. Here we show that the motin family member AMOTL1 is an important effector of Hippo signaling in breast cancer. AMOTL1 connects Hippo signaling to tumor cell aggressiveness. We show that both canonical and noncanonical Hippo signaling modulates AMOTL1 levels. The tumor suppressor Merlin triggers AMOTL1 proteasomal degradation mediated by the NEDD family of ubiquitin ligases through direct interaction. In parallel, YAP stimulates AMOTL1 expression. The loss of Merlin expression and the induction of Yap activity that are frequently observed in breast cancers thus result in elevated AMOTL1 levels. AMOTL1 expression is sufficient to trigger tumor cell migration and stimulates proliferation by activating c-Src. In a large cohort of human breast tumors, we show that AMOTL1 protein levels are upregulated during cancer progression and that, importantly, the expression of AMOTL1 in lymph node metastasis appears predictive of the risk of relapse. Hence we uncover an important mechanism by which Hippo signaling promotes breast cancer progression by modulating the expression of AMOTL1.",

Metastasis of MC-38GFP, 3LL, and LLC1 cells was significantly attenuated upon dnCCL2-HSA chimera treatment. Tumor cell seeding to the lungs resulted in enhanced expression of a proteoglycan syndecan-4 by endothelial cells that correlated with accumulation of the dnCCL2-HSA chimera in the vicinity of tumor cells. These findings demonstrate that the CCL2-based decoy protein effectively binds to the activated endothelium in lungs and blocks tumor cell extravasation through inhibition of vascular permeability.",

     "abstract": "Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a rare and incurable brain tumor that arises predominately in children and involves the pons, a structure that along with the midbrain and medulla makes up the brainstem. We have previously developed genetically engineered mouse models of brainstem glioma using the RCAS/Tv-a system by targeting PDGF-B overexpression, p53 loss, and H3.3K27M mutation to Nestin-expressing brainstem progenitor cells of the neonatal mouse. Here we describe a novel mouse model targeting these same genetic alterations to Pax3-expressing cells, which in the neonatal mouse pons consist of a Pax3\u00a0+/Nestin\u00a0+/Sox2\u00a0+ population lining the fourth ventricle and a Pax3\u00a0+/NeuN\u00a0+ parenchymal population. Injection of RCAS-PDGF-B into the brainstem of Pax3-Tv-a mice at postnatal day 3 results in 40% of mice developing asymptomatic low-grade glioma. A mixture of low- and high-grade glioma results from injection of Pax3-Tv-a;p53fl/fl mice with RCAS-PDGF-B and RCAS-Cre, with or without RCAS-H3.3K27M. These tumors are Ki67\u00a0+, Nestin\u00a0+, Olig2\u00a0+, and largely GFAP\u00a0\u2212 and can arise anywhere within the brainstem, including the classic DIPG location of the ventral pons. Expression of the H3.3K27M mutation reduces overall H3K27me3 as compared with tumors without the mutation, similar to what has been previously shown in human and mouse tumors. Thus, we have generated a novel genetically engineered mouse model of DIPG, which faithfully recapitulates the human disease and represents a novel platform with which to study the biology and treatment of this deadly disease.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Bone is a preferred site of breast cancer metastasis, suggesting the presence of tissue-specific features that attract and promote the outgrowth of breast cancer cells. We sought to identify parameters of human bone tissue associated with breast cancer cell osteotropism and colonization in the metastatic niche. METHODS: Migration and colonization patterns of MDA-MB-231-fLuc-EGFP (luciferase-enhanced green fluorescence protein) and MCF-7-fLuc-EGFP breast cancer cells were studied in co-culture with cancellous bone tissue fragments isolated from 14 hip arthroplasties. Breast cancer cell migration into tissues and toward tissue-conditioned medium was measured in Transwell migration chambers using bioluminescence imaging and analyzed as a function of secreted factors measured by multiplex immunoassay. Patterns of breast cancer cell colonization were evaluated with fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Enhanced MDA-MB-231-fLuc-EGFP breast cancer cell migration to bone-conditioned versus control medium was observed in 12/14 specimens (P = .0014) and correlated significantly with increasing levels of the adipokines/cytokines leptin (P = .006) and IL-1\u03b2 (P = .001) in univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry of fragments underscored the extreme adiposity of adult human bone tissues and revealed extensive breast cancer cell colonization within the marrow adipose tissue compartment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that breast cancer cells migrate to human bone tissue-conditioned medium in association with increasing levels of leptin and IL-1\u03b2, and colonize the bone marrow adipose tissue compartment of cultured fragments. Bone marrow adipose tissue and its molecular signals may be important but understudied components of the breast cancer metastatic niche.",

     "abstract": "Subpopulations of cells that escape anti-cancer treatment can cause relapse in cancer patients. Therefore, measurements of cellular-level tumor heterogeneity could enable improved anti-cancer treatment regimens. Cancer exhibits altered cellular metabolism, which affects the autofluorescence of metabolic cofactors NAD(P)H and FAD. The optical redox ratio (fluorescence intensity of NAD(P)H divided by FAD) reflects global cellular metabolism. The fluorescence lifetime (amount of time a fluorophore is in the excited state) is sensitive to microenvironment, particularly protein-binding. High-resolution imaging of the optical redox ratio and fluorescence lifetimes of NAD(P)H and FAD (optical metabolic imaging) enables single-cell analyses. In this study, mice with FaDu tumors were treated with the antibody therapy cetuximab or the chemotherapy cisplatin and imaged in vivo two days after treatment. Results indicate that fluorescence lifetimes of NAD(P)H and FAD are sensitive to early response (two days post-treatment, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05), compared with decreases in tumor size (nine days post-treatment, P\u00a0<\u00a0.05). Frequency histogram analysis of individual optical metabolic imaging parameters identifies subpopulations of cells, and a new heterogeneity index enables quantitative comparisons of cellular heterogeneity across treatment groups for individual variables. Additionally, a dimensionality reduction technique (viSNE) enables holistic visualization of multivariate optical measures of cellular heterogeneity. These analyses indicate increased heterogeneity in the cetuximab and cisplatin treatment groups compared with the control group. Overall, the combination of optical metabolic imaging and cellular-level analyses provide novel, quantitative insights into tumor heterogeneity.",

For this purpose, human prostate cancer PC3 cells were transfected with the luciferase gene fused with an oxygen-dependent degradation domain (ODD-luc) and a variant of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Both ODD-luciferase and EGFP were under the promotion of a poly-hypoxia-response element sequence (5xHRE). The cells constitutively expressed tdTomato red fluorescent protein. For validating the imaging strategy, cells were incubated under hypoxia (1% O2) for 48\u00a0hours and then reoxygenated. The luciferase activity of PC3-HRE-EGFP/HRE-ODD-luc/tdtomato cells detected by bioluminescent imaging rapidly decreased after reoxygenation, whereas EGFP levels in these cells remained stable for several hours. After in vitro validation, PC3-HRE-EGFP/HRE-ODD-luc/tdtomato tumors were implanted subcutaneously and orthotopically in nude male mice and imaged in vivo and ex vivo using optical imaging in proof-of-principle studies to demonstrate differences in optical patterns between EGFP expression and bioluminescence. This novel \"timer\" imaging strategy of combining the short-lived ODD-luciferase and the long-lived EGFP can provide a time frame of HRE activation in PC3 prostate cancer cells and will be useful to understand the temporal changes in hypoxia and HIF activity during cancer progression and following treatments including HIF targeting strategies.",

     "abstract": "Cancer cells can undergo stress-induced premature senescence, which is considered to be a desirable outcome of anticancer treatment. However, the escape from senescence and cancer cell repopulation give rise to some doubts concerning the effectiveness of the senescence-induced anticancer therapy. Similarly, it is postulated that polyploidization of cancer cells is connected with disease relapse. We postulate that cancer cell polyploidization associated with senescence is the culprit of atypical cell divisions leading to cancer cell regrowth. Accordingly, we aimed to dissociate between these two phenomena. We induced senescence in HCT 116 cells by pulse treatment with doxorubicin and observed transiently increased ploidy, abnormal nuclear morphology, and various distributions of some proteins (e.g., p21, Ki-67, SA-\u03b2-galactosidase) in the subnuclei. Doxorubicin-treated HCT 116 cells displayed an increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) possibly caused by an increased amount of mitochondria, which are characterized by low membrane potential. A decrease in the level of ROS by Trolox partially protected the cells from polyploidization but not from senescence. Interestingly, a decreased level of ROS prevented the cells from escaping senescence. We also show that MCF7 cells senesce, but this is not accompanied by the increase of ploidy upon doxorubicin treatment. Moreover, they were stably growth arrested, thus proving that polyploidy but not senescence per se enables to regain the ability to proliferate. Our preliminary results indicate that the different propensity of the HCT 116 and MCF7 cells to increase ploidy upon cell senescence could be caused by a different level of the mTOR and/or Pim-1 kinases.",

Eventually, therapy resistance develops in even the most responsive cases, but the mechanisms of resistance remain unclear. Herein, we developed two tumor models derived from an RCC cell line by conditioning the parental cells to two different stresses caused by VEGF-targeted therapy (sunitinib exposure and hypoxia) to investigate the mechanism of resistance to such therapy in RCC. Sunitinib-conditioned Caki-1 cells in vitro did not show resistance to sunitinib compared with parental cells, but when tested in vivo, these cells appeared to be highly resistant to sunitinib treatment. Hypoxia-conditioned Caki-1 cells are more resistant to hypoxia and have increased vascularity due to the upregulation of VEGF production; however, they did not develop sunitinib resistance either in vitro or in vivo. Human endothelial cells were more proliferative and showed increased tube formation in conditioned media from sunitinib-conditioned Caki-1 cells compared with parental cells. Gene expression profiling using RNA microarrays revealed that several genes related to tissue development and remodeling, including the development and migration of endothelial cells, were upregulated in sunitinib-conditioned Caki-1 cells compared with parental and hypoxia-conditioned cells. These findings suggest that evasive resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy is acquired by activation of VEGF-independent angiogenesis pathways induced through interactions with VEGF-targeted drugs, but not by hypoxia. These results emphasize that increased inhibition of tumor angiogenesis is required to delay the development of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy and maintain the therapeutic response in RCC.",

Supervised principal component analysis of mRNA expression data was used to evaluate the ability of the PAM50 panel to provide prognostic information in a stage I NSCLC cohort, in an all-stage NSCLC cohort, and in The Cancer Genome Atlas data. Immunohistochemistry was used to determine status of ER\u03b2 and other proteins in lung tumor tissue. Associations with prognosis were observed in the stage I cohort. Cross-validation identified seven genes that, when analyzed together, consistently showed survival associations. In pathway analysis, the seven-gene panel described one network containing the ER and progesterone receptor, as well as human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2/HER3 and neuregulin-1. NSCLC cases also showed a significant association between ER\u03b2 and HER2 protein expression. Cases positive for HER2 expression were more likely to express HER3, and ER\u03b2-positive cases were less likely to be both HER2 and HER3 negative. Prognostic ability of genes in the PAM50 panel was verified in an ER\u03b2-positive cohort representing all NSCLC stages. In The Cancer Genome Atlas data sets, the PAM50 gene set was prognostic in both adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, whereas the seven-gene panel was prognostic only in squamous cell carcinoma.

     "abstract": "Anoikis, a cell death mechanism triggered upon cell-matrix detachment, is regarded as a physiological suppressor of metastasis that can be regulated by a diverse array of signals. The protein encoded by GDF2 is BMP9 and is a member of the bone morphogenetic protein family and the transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b2 superfamily with emerging yet controversial roles in carcinogenesis. In an attempt to identify the function of growth and differentiation factor 2 (GDF2) in epithelial systems, we examined the signaling machinery that is involved and cell fate decisions in response to GDF2 in ovarian and breast epithelia. We find that GDF2 can robustly activate the SMAD1/5 signaling axis by increasing complex formation between the type I receptor serine threonine kinases activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 3 and ALK6 and the type II receptor serine threonine kinase BMPRII. This activation is independent of cross talk with the SMAD2-transforming growth factor \u03b2 pathway. By activating SMAD1/5, epithelial cells regulate anchorage-independent growth by increasing anoikis sensitivity that is dependent on GDF2\u2019s ability to sustain the activation of SMAD1/5 via ALK3 and ALK6. Consistent with a role for GDF2 in promoting anoikis susceptibility, the analysis of cell lines and patient data suggests epigenetic silencing of GDF2 in cancer cell lines and increased promoter methylation in patients. These findings collectively indicate an antimetastatic role for GDF2 in ovarian and breast cancer. The work also implicates loss of GDF2 via promoter methylation-mediated downregulation in promotion of carcinogenesis with significant relevance for the use of epigenetic drugs currently in clinical trials.",

CD45RO+ memory TILs show major prognostic impact in various malignancies but have not been extensively explored in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In this study, we aimed to evaluate their potential in a NSCLC TNM-Immunoscore. Tissue microarrays were constructed from tumor tissue samples from two cohorts including in total 536 patients (University Hospital of North Norway, n = 285; Nordland Hospital, n = 251) with primary resected stage I to IIIA NSCLC. The density of CD45RO+ and CD8+ TILs in tumor epithelial and stromal compartments of the tumors was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. In univariate analyses, intraepithelial CD45RO+ TIL density (T-CD45RO) was a significant prognostic factor for disease-specific survival (P = .007), limited to the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histology subgroup (P < .001), where it was significant in both cohorts (University Hospital of North Norway, P = .003; Nordland Hospital, P = .022). Combining T-CD45RO and stromal CD8+ TIL density (S-CD8) increased the prognostic impact in SCC (P < .001) and showed a significant impact within all pathological stages (I, P = .025; II, P < .001; III, P = .001). In the multivariate analysis, T-CD45RO was an independent positive prognostic factor for SCC (hazard ratio 2.65, 95% confidence interval 1.64-4.28, P < .001), and in combination with S-CD8, the prognostic impact increased vastly (high + high versus low + low: hazard ratio 6.50, 95% confidence interval 3.54-11.91, P < .001). In conclusion, T-CD45RO was an independent prognostic factor for SCC NSCLC. When combined with S-CD8, the prognostic impact increased and was significant within each pathological stage.

The contributions of HR repair inhibition and G2 checkpoint abrogation to sensitization were assessed by \u03b3H2AX, BRCA2 manipulation, and RAD51 focus formation and pHistone H3 flow cytometry, respectively. We found that AZD1775 sensitized to gemcitabine-radiation in BRCA2 wild-type but not BRCA2 mutant pancreatic cancer cells. In all cells, AZD1775 caused inhibition of CDK1 phosphorylation and G2 checkpoint abrogation. However, sensitization by AZD1775 was associated with persistent \u03b3H2AX and inhibition of RAD51 focus formation. In HR-proficient (BRCA2 wild-type) or -deficient (BRAC2 null) isogenic cells, AZD1775 sensitized to gemcitabine-radiation in BRCA2 wild-type, but not in BRCA2 null cells, despite significant G2 checkpoint abrogation. In patient-derived pancreatic tumor xenografts, AZD1775 significantly inhibited tumor growth and impaired RAD51 focus formation in response to gemcitabine-radiation. In conclusion, WEE1 inhibition by AZD1775 is an effective strategy for sensitizing pancreatic cancers to gemcitabine chemoradiation. Although this sensitization is accompanied by inhibition of CDK1 phosphorylation and G2 checkpoint abrogation, this mechanism is not sufficient for sensitization. Our findings demonstrate that sensitization to chemoradiation by WEE1 inhibition results from inhibition of HR repair and suggest that patient tumors without underlying HR defects would benefit most from this therapy.",

Two human melanoma xenograft lines (A-07, R-18) showing different TMEs were used as cancer models. Metabolic profile was assessed by proton high resolution magic angle spinning magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-HR-MAS-MRS). Tumor hypoxia was detected in immunostained histological preparations by using pimonidazole as a hypoxia marker. Twenty-four samples from 10 A-07 tumors and 28 samples from 10 R-18 tumors were analyzed. Metastasis was associated with hypoxia in both A-07 and R-18 tumors, and 1H-HR-MAS-MRS discriminated between tissue samples with and tissue samples without hypoxic regions in both models, primarily because hypoxia was associated with high lactate resonance peaks in A-07 tumors and with low lactate resonance peaks in R-18 tumors. Similarly, metastatic and non-metastatic R-18 tumors showed significantly different metabolic profiles, but not metastatic and non-metastatic A-07 tumors, probably because some samples from the metastatic A-07 tumors were derived from tumor regions without hypoxic tissue. This study suggests that 1H-HR-MAS-MRS may be a valuable tool for evaluating the role of hypoxia and lactate in tumor metastasis as well as for identification of metastasis-associated metabolic profiles.",

Leveraging a genetically engineered mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) low-grade brain tumor (optic glioma), we have previously demonstrated that microglia are essential for glioma formation and maintenance. To identify potential tumor-associated microglial factors that support glioma growth (gliomagens), we initiated a comprehensive large-scale discovery effort using optimized RNA-sequencing methods focused specifically on glioma-associated microglia. Candidate microglial gliomagens were prioritized to identify potential secreted or membrane-bound proteins, which were next validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction as well as by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization following minocycline-mediated microglial inactivation in vivo. Using these selection criteria, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (Ccl5) was identified as a chemokine highly expressed in genetically engineered Nf1 mouse optic gliomas relative to nonneoplastic optic nerves. As a candidate gliomagen, recombinant Ccl5 increased Nf1-deficient optic nerve astrocyte growth in vitro. Importantly, consistent with its critical role in maintaining tumor growth, treatment with Ccl5 neutralizing antibodies reduced Nf1 mouse optic glioma growth and improved retinal dysfunction in vivo. Collectively, these findings establish Ccl5 as an important microglial growth factor for low-grade glioma maintenance relevant to the development of future stroma-targeted brain tumor therapies.",

As homozygous alleles, p53 mutants are differentially associated with specific loss of heterozygosity (R273; chromosome 17); copy number variation (R175H; chromosome 9); and up-stream, cancer-related regulatory pathways. The expression of immune-related cytokines was selectively related to p53 status, showing for the first time that specific p53 mutants impact, and are related to, the immune subtype of ovarian cancer. Although the majority (31%) of HGSCs exhibit loss of heterozygosity, a significant number (24%) maintain a wild-type (WT) allele and represent another HGSC subtype that is not well defined.

We also show that siRNA knock down of endogenous p53 in cells expressing homozygous mutant alleles causes apoptosis, whereas cells expressing WT p53 (or are heterozygous for WT and mutant p53 alleles) are highly resistant. Therefore, despite different gene regulatory pathways associated with specific p53 mutants, silencing mutant p53 might be a suitable, powerful, global strategy for blocking ovarian cancer growth in those tumors that rely on mutant p53 functions for survival.

     "abstract": "STAT3 activation is associated with poor prognosis in human colorectal cancer (CRC). Our previous data demonstrated that regorafenib (Stivarga) is a pharmacological agonist of SH2 domain-containing phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) that enhances SHP-1 activity and induces apoptosis by targeting STAT3 signals in CRC. This study aimed to find a therapeutic drug that is more effective than regorafenib for CRC treatment. Here, we showed that SC-43 was more effective than regorafenib at inducing apoptosis in vitro and suppressing tumorigenesis in vivo. SC-43 significantly increased SHP-1 activity, downregulated p-STAT3Tyr705 level, and induced apoptosis in CRC cells. An SHP-1 inhibitor or knockdown of SHP-1 by siRNA both significantly rescued the SC-43\u2013induced apoptosis and decreased p-STAT3Tyr705 level. Conversely, SHP-1 overexpression increased the effects of SC-43 on apoptosis and p-STAT3Tyr705 level. These data suggest that SC-43\u2013induced apoptosis mediated through the loss of p-STAT3Tyr705 was dependent on SHP-1 function. Importantly, SC-43\u2013enhanced SHP-1 activity was because of the docking potential of SC-43, which relieved the autoinhibited N-SH2 domain of SHP-1 and inhibited p-STAT3Tyr705 signals. Importantly, we observed that a significant negative correlation existed between SHP-1 and p-STAT3Tyr705expression in CRC patients (P = .038). Patients with strong SHP-1 and weak p-STAT3Tyr705 expression had significantly higher overall survival compared with patients with weak SHP-1 and strong p-STAT3Tyr705 expression (P = .029). In conclusion, SHP-1 is suitable to be a useful prognostic marker and a pharmacological target for CRC treatment.

     "abstract": "Over the past decade, inhibition of the kinase activities of oncogenic proteins using small molecules and antibodies has been a mainstay of our anticancer drug development effort, resulting in several Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved cancer therapies. The clinical effectiveness of kinase-targeted agents has been inconsistent, mostly because of the development of resistance. The expression and function of oncoproteins and tumor suppressors are regulated by numerous posttranslational protein modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation; hence, targeting specific posttranslational protein modifications provides for an attractive strategy for anticancer drug development. The present review discusses the hypothesis that targeted degradation of an oncoprotein may overcome many of the shortcomings seen with kinase inhibitors and that the approach would enable targeted inhibition of oncogenic proteins previously thought to be undruggable.",

     "abstract": "Cellular senescence is a barrier to tumorigenesis in normal cells, and tumor cells undergo senescence responses to genotoxic stimuli, which is a potential target phenotype for cancer therapy. However, in this setting, mixed-mode responses are common with apoptosis the dominant effect. Hence, more selective senescence inducers are required. Here we report a machine learning\u2013based in silico screen to identify potential senescence agonists. We built profiles of differentially affected biological process networks from expression data obtained under induced telomere dysfunction conditions in colorectal cancer cells and matched these to a panel of 17 protein targets with confirmatory screening data in PubChem. We trained a neural network using 3517 compounds identified as active or inactive against these targets. The resulting classification model was used to screen a virtual library of ~\u00a02M lead-like compounds. One hundred and forty-seven virtual hits were acquired for validation in growth inhibition and senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase assays. Among the found hits, a benzimidazolone compound, CB-20903630, had low micromolar IC50 for growth inhibition of HCT116 cells and selectively induced senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity in the entire treated cell population without cytotoxicity or apoptosis induction. Growth suppression was mediated by G1 blockade involving increased p21 expression and suppressed cyclin B1, CDK1, and CDC25C. In addition, the compound inhibited growth of multicellular spheroids and caused severe retardation of population kinetics in long-term treatments. Preliminary structure-activity and structure clustering analyses are reported, and expression analysis of CB-20903630 against other cell cycle suppressor compounds suggested a PI3K/AKT-inhibitor\u2013like profile in normal cells, with different pathways affected in cancer cells.",

The reason and the rationale for why this is so are easily appreciated: literally a \u201ctest of time,\u201d OS is a seemingly unambiguous, agenda-free end point, independent of bias-prone variables such as the frequency and methods of assessment, clinical evaluation, and the definition of progression. However, by general consensus, OS is an imperfect end point for several reasons: First, it may often be impractical because of the length, cost, and the size of clinical trials. Second, OS captures the impact of subsequent therapies, both beneficial (i.e., active) and detrimental, on survival but it does not take into account the contribution of subsequent therapies by treatment arm; the postprogression period is treated as an unknown black box (no information about the potential influence of next-line therapies on the outcome) under the implicit assumption that the clinical trial treatment is the only clinical variable that matters: what OS explicitly measures is the destination, that is, the elapsed time between the date of randomization (or intention to treat) and the date of death, not the journey, that is, what transpires in-between.In long-term maintenance strategies, patients receive treatment in temporally separated but mutually interdependent and causally linked sequences that exert a \u201cfield of influence\u201d akin to action-at-a-distance forces like gravity, electricity, and magnetism on both the tumor and each other. Hence, in this setting, a new end point, PFS2, is required to measure this field of influence. This article reviews the definition and use in clinical trials of PFS2 and makes the case for its potential applicability as a preferred end point to measure the mutual influence of individual regimens in long-term maintenance strategies with resensitizing agents in particular.",

LPA is a potent mitogen in cancer cells. The mechanism linking LPA signal to cancer cell proliferation is not well understood. Little is known about whether LPA affects glucose metabolism to accommodate rapid proliferation of cancer cells. Here we describe that in ovarian cancer cells, LPA enhances glycolytic rate and lactate efflux. A real time PCR-based miniarray showed that hexokinase II (HK2) was the most dramatically induced glycolytic gene to promote glycolysis in LPA-treated cells. Analysis of the human HK2 gene promoter identified the sterol regulatory element-binding protein as the primary mediator of LPA-induced HK2 transcription. The effects of LPA on HK2 and glycolysis rely on LPA2, an LPA receptor subtype overexpressed in ovarian cancer and many other malignancies. We further examined the general role of growth factor-induced glycolysis in cell proliferation. Like LPA, epidermal growth factor (EGF) elicited robust glycolytic and proliferative responses in ovarian cancer cells. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin, however, potently stimulated cell proliferation but only modestly induced glycolysis. Consistent with their differential effects on glycolysis, LPA and EGF-dependent cell proliferation was highly sensitive to glycolytic inhibition while the growth-promoting effect of IGF-1 or insulin was more resistant. These results indicate that LPA- and EGF-induced cell proliferation selectively involves up-regulation of HK2 and glycolytic metabolism. The work is the first to implicate LPA signaling in promotion of glucose metabolism in cancer cells.",

We xenografted human primary and metastatic tumor samples into immunodeficient mice and found that a fraction of PDX tumors generated from patients\u2019 samples of breast, colon, pancreatic, bladder and renal cancer were histologically similar to lymphocytic neoplasms. Moreover, we found that the first passage of breast and pancreatic cancer PDX tumors after initial transplantation of the tumor pieces from the same human tumor graft could grow as a lymphocytic tumor in one mouse and as an adenocarcinoma in another mouse. Whereas subcutaneous PDX tumors resembling human adenocarcinoma histology were slow growing and non-metastatic, we found that subcutaneous PDX lymphocytic tumors were fast growing and formed large metastatic lesions in mouse lymph nodes, liver, lungs, and spleen. PDX lymphocytic tumors were comprised of B-cells which were Epstein-Barr virus positive and expressed CD45 and CD20. Because B-cells are typically present in malignant solid tumors, formation of B-cell tumor may evolve in a wide range of PDX tumor models.

     "abstract": "Nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase\u2013expressing (NPM-ALK+) T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive form of cancer that commonly affects children and adolescents. The expression of NPM-ALK chimeric oncogene results from the chromosomal translocation t(2;5)(p23;q35) that causes the fusion of the ALK and NPM genes. This translocation generates the NPM-ALK protein tyrosine kinase that forms the constitutively activated NPM-ALK/NPM-ALK homodimers. In addition, NPM-ALK is structurally associated with wild-type NPM to form NPM/NPM-ALK heterodimers, which can translocate to the nucleus. The mechanisms that sustain the stability of NPM-ALK are not fully understood. SUMOylation is a posttranslational modification that is characterized by the reversible conjugation of small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs) with target proteins. SUMO competes with ubiquitin for substrate binding and therefore, SUMOylation is believed to protect target proteins from proteasomal degradation. Moreover, SUMOylation contributes to the subcellular distribution of target proteins. Herein, we found that the SUMOylation pathway is deregulated in NPM-ALK+ T-cell lymphoma cell lines and primary lymphoma tumors from patients. We also identified Lys24 and Lys32 within the NPM domain as the sites where NPM-ALK conjugates with SUMO-1 and SUMO-3. Importantly, antagonizing SUMOylation by the SENP1 protease decreased the accumulation of NPM-ALK and suppressed lymphoma cell viability, proliferation, and anchorage-independent colony formation. One possible mechanism for the SENP1-mediated decrease in NPM-ALK levels was the increase in NPM-ALK association with ubiquitin, which facilitates its degradation. Our findings propose a model in which aberrancies in SUMOylation contribute to the pathogenesis of NPM-ALK+ T-cell lymphoma. Unraveling such pathogenic mechanisms may lead to devising novel strategies to eliminate this aggressive neoplasm.",

Although it has been shown that PTN is expressed in tumor cells, few studies have investigated its receptors and their involvement in cell migration and invasion. Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) is a receptor for multiple growth factors that mediates cell motility and plays an important role in angiogenesis and tumor progression. Here we provide evidence for the first time that NRP-1 is crucial for biological activities of PTN. We found that PTN interacted directly with NRP-1 through its thrombospondin type-I repeat domains. Importantly, binding of PTN to NRP-1 stimulated the internalization and recycling of NRP-1 at the cell surface. Invalidation of NRP-1 by RNA interference in human carcinoma cells inhibited PTN-induced intracellular signaling of the serine-threonine kinase, mitogen-activated protein MAP kinase, and focal adhesion kinase pathways. Accordingly, NRP-1 silencing or blocking by antibody inhibited PTN-induced human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and tumor cell invasion. These results suggest that NRP-1/PTN interaction provides a novel mechanism for controlling the response of endothelial and tumoral cells to PTN and may explain, at least in part, how PTN contributes to tumor angiogenesis and cancer progression.",

Using dual-color bioluminescence imaging to selectively quantify viability of cancer and stromal cells in the same spheroid, we identified single compounds and combination treatments that preferentially eliminated quiescent breast cancer cells but not stromal cells. A treatment combination effective against malignant cells in spheroids also eliminated breast cancer cells from bone marrow in a mouse xenograft model.

     "abstract": "Many malignant characteristics of cancer cells are regulated through pathways induced by the tyrosine kinase activity of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Herein, we show that besides directly affecting the biology of cancer cells per se, EGFR also regulates the primary tumor microenvironment. Specifically, our findings demonstrate that both the expression and signaling activity of EGFR are required for the induction of a distinct intratumoral vasculature capable of sustaining tumor cell intravasation, a critical rate-limiting step in the metastatic cascade. An intravasation-sustaining mode of intratumoral angiogenic vessels depends on high levels of tumor cell EGFR and the interplay between EGFR-regulated production of interleukin 8 by tumor cells, interleukin-8\u2013induced influx of tumor-infiltrating neutrophils delivering their unique matrix metalloproteinase-9, and neutrophil matrix metalloproteinase-9\u2013dependent release of the vascular permeability and endothelial growth factor, VEGF. Our data indicate that through VEGF-mediated disruption of endothelial layer integrity and increase of intratumoral vasculature permeability, EGFR activity significantly facilitates active intravasation of cancer cells. Therefore, this study unraveled an important but overlooked function of EGFR in cancer, namely, its ability to create an intravasation-sustaining microenvironment within the developing primary tumor by orchestrating several interrelated processes required for the initial steps of cancer metastasis through vascular routes. Our findings also suggest that EGFR-targeted therapies might be more effective when implemented in cancer patients with early-staged primary tumors containing a VEGF-dependent angiogenic vasculature. Accordingly, early EGFR inhibition combined with various anti-VEGF approaches could synergistically suppress tumor cell intravasation through inhibiting the highly permeable angiogenic vasculature induced by EGFR-overexpressing aggressive cancer cells.",

We have recently identified somatic hotspot mutations in RNase IIIb domain of DICER1 in half of ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors, a rare class of sex-cord stromal cell tumors in young women. These hotspot mutations lost IIIb cleavage activity of DICER1 in vitro and failed to produce 5p-derived miRNAs in mouse Dicer1-null ES cells. However, the oncogenic potential of these hotspot DICER1 mutations has not been studied. Here, we further revealed that the global expression of 5p-derived miRNAs was dramatically reduced in ovarian Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors carrying DICER1 hotspot mutations compared with those without DICER1 hotspot mutation. The miRNA production defect was associated with the deregulation of genes controlling cell proliferation and the cell fate. Using an immortalized human granulosa cell line, SVOG3e, we determined that the D1709N-DICER1 hotspot mutation failed to produce 5p-derived miRNAs, deregulated the expression of several genes that control gonadal differentiation and cell proliferation, and promoted cell growth. Re-expression of let-7 significantly inhibited the growth of D1709N-DICER1 SVOG3e cells, accompanied by the suppression of key regulators of cell cycle control and ovarian gonad differentiation. Taken together, our data revealed that DICER1 hotspot mutations cause systemic loss of 5p-miRNAs that can both drive pseudodifferentiation of testicular elements and cause oncogenic transformation in the ovary.",

In a preventative CT26 mouse tumor model, both doxorubicin and Doxil synergized with anti\u2013PD-1 and CTLA-4 mAbs. Doxil was active when CT26 tumors were grown in immunocompetent mice but not immunocompromised mice, demonstrating that Doxil activity is increased in the presence of a functional immune system. Using established tumors and maximally efficacious doses of Doxil and cancer immunotherapies in either CT26 or MCA205 tumor models, combination groups produced strong synergistic antitumor effects, a larger percentage of complete responders, and increased survival. In vivo pharmacodynamic studies showed that Doxil treatment decreased the percentage of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells and, in combination with anti\u2013PD-L1, increased the percentage of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. In the tumor, Doxil administration increased CD80 expression on mature dendritic cells. CD80 expression was also increased on both monocytic and granulocytic myeloid cells, suggesting that Doxil may induce these tumor-infiltrating cells to elicit a costimulatory phenotype capable of activating an antitumor T-cell response. These results uncover a novel role for Doxil in immunomodulation and support the use of Doxil in combination with checkpoint blockade or TNFR agonists to increase response rates and antitumor activity.",

We studied two isogenic breast cancer cells lines (highly metastatic 4T1; nonmetastatic 67NR) to identify differences in their glucose and glutamine metabolism in response to metabolic and environmental stress. Dynamic magnetic resonance spectroscopy of 13C-isotopomers showed that 4T1 cells have higher glycolytic and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux than 67NR cells and readily switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in response to different extracellular environments. OXPHOS activity increased with metastatic potential in isogenic cell lines derived from the same primary breast cancer: 4T1 > 4T07 and 168FARN (local micrometastasis only) > 67NR. We observed a restricted TCA cycle flux at the succinate dehydrogenase step in 67NR cells (but not in 4T1 cells), leading to succinate accumulation and hindering OXPHOS. In the four isogenic cell lines, environmental stresses modulated succinate dehydrogenase subunit A expression according to metastatic potential. Moreover, glucose-derived lactate production was more glutamine dependent in cell lines with higher metastatic potential. These studies show clear differences in TCA cycle metabolism between 4T1 and 67NR breast cancer cells. They indicate that metastases-forming 4T1 cells are more adept at adjusting their metabolism in response to environmental stress than isogenic, nonmetastatic 67NR cells. We suggest that the metabolic plasticity and adaptability are more important to the metastatic breast cancer phenotype than rapid cell proliferation alone, which could 1) provide a new biomarker for early detection of this phenotype, possibly at the time of diagnosis, and 2) lead to new treatment strategies of metastatic breast cancer by targeting mitochondrial metabolism.",

This study was aimed to investigate the inhibitory effect and accompanying mechanisms of kaempferol on epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration induced by transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21). In human A549 non\u2013small lung cancer cells, kaempferol strongly blocked the enhancement of cell migration by TGF-\u03b21\u2013induced EMT through recovering the loss of E-cadherin and suppressing the induction of mesenchymal markers as well as the upregulation of TGF-\u03b21\u2013mediated matrix metalloproteinase-2 activity.

Mechanism study revealed that the phosphorylation of Smad3 linker region induced by TGF-\u03b21 was required for the induction of EMT and cell migration, and selective downregulation of the phosphorylation of Smad3 at Thr179 residue (not Ser204, Ser208, and Ser213) in the linker region was responsible for the inhibition by kaempferol of TGF-\u03b21\u2013induced EMT and cell migration.

Although EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors are effective for NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutations, patients invariably develop resistance to these agents. Alterations in multiple signaling cascades have been associated with the development of resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Sonic Hedgehog and associated Gli transcription factors play a major role in embryonic development and have recently been found to be reactivated in NSCLC, and elevated Gli1 levels correlate with poor prognosis. The Hedgehog pathway has been implicated in the functions of cancer stem cells, although the underlying molecular mechanisms are not clear. In this context, we demonstrate that Gli1 is a strong regulator of embryonic stem cell transcription factor Sox2. Depletion of Gli1 or inhibition of the Hedgehog signaling significantly abrogated the self-renewal of stem-like side-population cells from NSCLCs as well as vascular mimicry of such cells. Gli1 was found to transcriptionally regulate Sox2 through its promoter region, and Gli1 could be detected on the Sox2 promoter. Inhibition of Hedgehog signaling appeared to work cooperatively with EGFR inhibitors in markedly reducing the viability of NSCLC cells as well as the self-renewal of stem-like cells. Thus, our study demonstrates a cooperative functioning of the EGFR signaling and Hedgehog pathways in governing the stem-like functions of NSCLC cancer stem cells and presents a novel therapeutic strategy to combat NSCLC harboring EGFR mutations.",

Stable lentiviral knockdown of MCL1 sensitized LN229 and U87 glioma cells to apoptotic cell death induced by single-agent treatment with ABT-737 which was associated with an early activation of DEVDase activity, cytochrome c release, and nuclear apoptosis. Similar sensitizing effects were observed when ABT-737 treatment was combined with the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib which effectively suppressed levels of phosphorylated STAT3 and MCL1 in MCL1-proficient LN229 and U87 glioma cells. In analogous fashion, these synergistic effects were observed when we combined ABT-737 with the STAT3 inhibitor WP-1066. Lentiviral knockdown of the activating transcription factor 5 combined with subsequent quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that sorafenib-dependent suppression of MCL1 occurred at the transcriptional level but did not depend on activating transcription factor 5 which previously had been proposed to be essential for MCL1-dependent glioma cell survival. In contrast, the constitutively active STAT3 mutant STAT3-C was able to significantly enhance MCL1 levels under sorafenib treatment to retain cell survival. Collectively, these data demonstrate that sorafenib targets MCL1 in a STAT3-dependent manner, thereby sensitizing glioma cells to treatment with ABT-737.

Inflammation is often caused by a variety of inflammatory cytokine such as the interleukin (IL)-6, a pleiotrophic cytokine known to be involved in the tumorigenesis. In this study, an in vivo hepatic tumorigenesis model of zebrafish was generated to demonstrate a direct consequence of the human IL6 expression causing hepatocarcinogenesis. To do this, an elevated expression of the hIL6 gene was established to specifically target the zebrafish hepatocytes by transgenesis. Interestingly, the elevated hIL6 expression caused the chronic inflammation which results in a massive infiltration of inflammatory cells. This eventually resulted in the generation of various dysplastic lesions such as clear cell, small cell, and large cell changes, and also eosinophilic and basophilic foci of hepatocellular alteration. Hepatocellular carcinoma was then developed in the transgenic zebrafish. Molecular characterization revealed upregulation of the downstream components involved in the IL6-mediated signaling pathways, especially PI3K/Akt and JAK/STAT3 pathways. Further investigation indicated that PI3K was the most reactive to the infiltrated inflammatory cells and dysplasia with large cell change, whereas STAT3 was heavily activated in the region with dysplastic foci, suggesting that the JAK/STAT3 pathway was mainly implicated in the hepatic tumorigenesis in the current model. Our present study provides an in vivo evidence of the relationship between chronic inflammation and tumorigenesis and reinforces the pivotal role of IL6 in the inflammation-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling activation has been reported only during the late steps of Barrett\u2019s esophagus (BE) neoplastic progression, but not in BE metaplasia, based on the absence of nuclear \u03b2-catenin. However, \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity has been recorded in absence of robust nuclear accumulation. Thus, we aimed to investigate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in nondysplastic BE. METHODS: Esophageal tissues from healthy and BE patients without dysplasia were analyzed for Wnt target gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Esophageal squamous (EPC1-& EPC2-hTERT), BE metaplastic (CP-A), and adenocarcinoma (OE33) cell lines were characterized for Wnt activation by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase assay. Wnt activity regulation was examined by using recombinant Wnt3a and Dickkopf-1 (Dkk1) as well as Dkk1 short interfering RNA. RESULTS: Wnt target genes (AXIN2, c-MYC, Cyclin D1, Dkk1) and Wnt3a were significantly upregulated in nondysplastic BE compared with squamous mucosa. Elevated levels of dephosphorylated \u03b2-catenin were detected in nondysplastic BE. Nuclear active \u03b2-catenin and TOPflash activity were increased in CP-A and OE33 cells compared with squamous cells. Wnt3a-mediated \u03b2-catenin signaling activation was abolished by Dkk1 in CP-A cells. TOPFlash activity was elevated following Dkk1 silencing in CP-A but not in OE33 cells. Dysplastic and esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues demonstrated further Dkk1 and AXIN2 overexpression. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the absence of robust nuclear accumulation, \u03b2-catenin is transcriptionally active in nondysplastic BE. Dkk1 overexpression regulates \u03b2-catenin signaling in BE metaplastic but not in adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that early perturbation of Dkk1-mediated signaling suppression may contribute to BE malignant transformation.",

     "abstract": "Reprogramming of energy metabolism is one of the emerging hallmarks of cancer. Up-regulation of energy metabolism pathways fuels cell growth and division, a key characteristic of neoplastic disease, and can lead to dependency on specific metabolic pathways. Thus, targeting energy metabolism pathways might offer the opportunity for novel therapeutics. Here, we describe the application of a novel in vivo screening approach for the identification of genes involved in cancer metabolism using a patient-derived pancreatic xenograft model. Lentiviruses expressing short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting 12 different cell surface protein transporters were separately transduced into the primary pancreatic tumor cells. Transduced cells were pooled and implanted into mice. Tumors were harvested at different times, and the frequency of each shRNA was determined as a measure of which ones prevented tumor growth. Several targets including carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), monocarboxylate transporter 4, and anionic amino acid transporter light chain, xc- system (xCT) were identified in these studies and shown to be required for tumor initiation and growth. Interestingly, CAIX was overexpressed in the tumor initiating cell population. CAIX expression alone correlated with a highly tumorigenic subpopulation of cells. Furthermore, CAIX expression was essential for tumor initiation because shRNA knockdown eliminated the ability of cells to grow in vivo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first parallel in vivo assessment of multiple novel oncology target genes using a patient-derived pancreatic tumor model.",

     "abstract": "Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase (Smac) mimetics are considered as promising anticancer therapeutics that are currently under investigation in early clinical trials. They induce apoptosis by antagonizing inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, which are frequently overexpressed in cancer. We previously reported that Smac mimetics, such as BV6, additionally exert non-apoptotic functions in glioblastoma (GBM) cells by stimulating migration and invasion in a nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB)-dependent manner. Because NF-\u03baB target genes mediating these effects are largely unknown, we performed whole-genome expression analyses. Here, we identify chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) as the top-listed NF-\u03baB-regulated gene being upregulated upon BV6 treatment in GBM cells. BV6-induced upregulation and secretion of CCL2 are required for migration and invasion of GBM cells because knockdown of CCL2 in GBM cells abolishes these effects. Co-culture experiments of GBM cells with non-malignant astroglial cells reveal that BV6-stimulated secretion of CCL2 by GBM cells into the supernatant triggers migration of astroglial cells toward GBM cells because CCL2 knockdown in BV6-treated GBM cells impedes BV6-stimulated migration of astroglial cells. In conclusion, we identify CCL2 as a BV6-induced NF-\u03baB target gene that triggers migration and invasion of GBM cells and exerts paracrine effects on the GBM's microenvironment by stimulating migration of astroglial cells. These findings provide novel insights into the biological functions of Smac mimetics with important implications for the development of Smac mimetics as cancer therapeutics.",

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for prostate cancer eventually fails with relapse occurring in the form of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). CRPC tumors typically overexpress androgen receptor (AR), demonstrating continued dependence upon AR signaling. Platelets have been previously demonstrated to contain androgens, and we sought to explore the contribution of platelet-derived androgens in CRPC. In this study, we examined the role of platelet-derived androgens in vitro using platelets from men with CRPC, men with high-risk prostate cancer, and healthy male donors. A series of in vitro assays was performed to elucidate the impact of platelet-derived androgens on androgen-sensitive prostate tumor cells. By examining platelet-derived androgen effects on AR signaling in prostate tumor cells, we found that platelets, from men with CRPC and on ADT, strongly induce AR target genes and tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, we show a fully intact testosterone (T) biosynthetic pathway within platelets from its precursor cholesterol and demonstrate that platelets of CRPC patients with ADT resistance are able to generate T. Overall, our findings reveal an unknown capacity of platelets to synthesize T at functionally relevant levels in patients with lethal prostate cancer. Importantly, it suggests a novel paracrine mechanism of T production that may act to sustain CRPC state and potentiate therapeutic resistance.",

We investigated the role of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) in regulating IL-6\u2013driven Notch1 activation and the ability to target breast CSCs through ILK inhibition. Ectopic expression/short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of ILK, pharmacological inhibition of ILK with the small molecule T315, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and luciferase reporter assays were used to evaluate the regulation of IL-6\u2013driven Notch1 activation by ILK in IL-6\u2013producing triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SUM-159) and in MCF-7 and MCF-7IL-6 cells. The effects of ILK on \u03b3-secretase complex assembly and cellular localization were determined by immunofluorescence, Western blots of membrane fractions, and immunoprecipitation. In vivo effects of T315-induced ILK inhibition on CSCs in SUM-159 xenograft models were assessed by mammosphere assays, flow cytometry, and tumorigenicity assays. Results show that the genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of ILK suppressed Notch1 activation and the abundance of the \u03b3-secretase components presenilin-1, nicastrin, and presenilin enhancer 2 at the posttranscriptional level via inhibition of caveolin-1-dependent membrane assembly of the \u03b3-secretase complex. Accordingly, knockdown of ILK inhibited breast CSC-like properties in vitro and the breast CSC subpopulation in vivo in xenograft tumor models. Based on these findings, we propose a novel function of ILK in regulating \u03b3-secretase\u2013mediated Notch1 activation, which suggests the targeting of ILK as a therapeutic approach to suppress IL-6\u2013induced breast CSCs.",

In this study, we reassess the biology of membrane-bound IL-15 (mb-IL-15) isoforms by comparing primary cultures of human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC) to peritumoral (ptumTEC), tumoral (RCC), and cancer stem cells (CSC/CD105+). RPTEC express a 14 to 16 kDa mb-IL-15, whose existence has been assumed but never formally demonstrated and likely represents the isoform anchored at the cell membrane through the IL-15 receptor \u03b1 (IL-15R\u03b1) chain, because it is sensitive to acidic treatment and is not competent to deliver a reverse signal. By contrast, ptumTEC, RCC, and CSC express a novel N-hyperglycosylated, short-lived transmembrane mb-IL-15 (tmb-IL-15) isoform around 27 kDa, resistant to acidic shock, delivering a reverse signal in response to its soluble receptor (sIL-15R\u03b1). This reverse signal triggers the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor gene E-cadherin in ptumTEC and RCC but not in CSC/CD105+, where it promotes survival. Indeed, through the AKT pathway, tmb-IL-15 protects CSC/CD105+ from non-programmed cell death induced by serum starvation. Finally, both mb-IL-15 and tmb-IL-15 are sensitive to metalloproteases, and the cleaved tmb-IL-15 (25 kDa) displays a powerful anti-apoptotic effect on human hematopoietic cells. Overall, our data indicate that both mb-IL-15 and tmb-IL-15 isoforms play a complex role in renal pathophysiology downregulating E-cadherin and favoring cell survival. Moreover, \u201capparently normal\u201d ptumTEC cells, sharing different properties with RCC, could contribute to organize an enlarged peritumoral \u201cpreneoplastic\u201d environment committed to favor tumor progression.",

Moreover, patients with myeloid neoplasm frequently harbor c-Cbl mutations, implicating the role of c-Cbl as a tumor suppressor. Recently, we have shown that c-Cbl downregulates \u03b1Pix-mediated cell migration and invasion, and the lack of c-Cbl in the rat C6 and human A172 glioma cells is responsible for their malignant behavior. Here, we showed that c-Cbl exon skipping occurs in the glioma cells and the brain tissues from glioblastoma patients lacking c-Cbl. This exon skipping resulted in generation of two types of c-Cbl isoforms: type I lacking exon-9 and type II lacking exon-9 and exon-10. However, the c-Cbl isoforms in the cells and tissues could not be detected as they were rapidly degraded by proteasome. Consequently, C6 and A172 cells showed sustained EGFR activation. However, no splice site mutation was found in the region from exon-7 to exon-11 of the c-Cbl gene in C6 cells and a glioblastoma tissue lacking c-Cbl. In addition, c-Cbl exon skipping could be induced when cells transfected with a c-Cbl mini-gene were grown to high density or under hypoxic stress. These results suggest that unknown alternations (e.g., mutation) of splicing machinery in C6 and A172 cells and the glioblastoma brain tissues are responsible for the deleterious exon skipping. Collectively, these findings indicate that the c-Cbl exon skipping contributes to human glioma and its malignant behavior.",

At gene expression profile, several genes involved in cell adhesion were upregulated in MDS ECFCs, while several members of the Wingless and int (Wnt) pathways were underexpressed. Furthermore, at miRNA expression profile, MDS ECFCs hypo-expressed various miRNAs involved in Wnt pathway regulation. The addition of Wnt3A reduced the expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 on MDS ECFCs and restored the defective expression of markers of differentiation.

Herein, we confirmed that human renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) express a membrane-bound IL-15 isoform displaying an unusual molecular weight of 27 kDa. Its stimulation with soluble IL-15 receptor \u03b1 chain (s-IL-15R\u03b1) triggers epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process as shown by the down-regulation of E-cadherin and zona occludens 1 and the up-regulation of vimentin and N-cadherin and promotes the migratory and invasive properties of RCC. S-IL-15R\u03b1 treatment triggered the Src/PI3K/Akt/GSK-3\u03b2 pathway and promoted \u03b2-catenin nuclei translocation. Deactivation of this pathway by using Src-specific inhibitor PP2, PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and AKT inhibitor MK2206 hampered \u03b2-catenin nuclei translocation and suppressed EMT, migration, and invasion of RCC. S-IL-15R\u03b1 treatment also enhanced Src-dependent phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal\u2013regulated kinase (Erk1/2). FAK knockdown significantly decreased the migration and invasion of RCC, which suggest that Src-FAK signaling was involved in s-IL-15R\u03b1\u2013favored migration and invasion of RCC. At the same time, inhibitors of Erk1/2 also significantly decreased the migration and invasion of RCC but could not reverse s-IL-15R\u03b1\u2013induced EMT. Taken together, our results reveal that Src-dependent PI3K/Akt/GSK3b/\u03b2-catenin pathway is required for s-IL-15Ra\u2013dependent induction of EMT in RCC, while Src-FAK and Src-Erk1/2 signaling were involved in s-IL-15R\u03b1\u2013promoted migration and invasion properties of RCC.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are one of the most abundant cell types of the tumor microenvironment, playing an important role in tumor progression. Multiple origins for CAFs have been proposed including resident fibroblasts, adipocytes, and bone marrow. Our laboratory previously identified a novel hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) origin for CAFs; however, the functional roles of HSC-derived CAFs (HSC-CAFs) in tumor progression have not yet been examined. To test the hypothesis that HSC-CAFs promote tumor progression through contribution to extracellular matrix (ECM) and paracrine production of pro-angiogenic factors, we developed a method to isolate HSC-CAFs. HSC-CAFs were profiled on the basis of their expression of hematopoietic and fibroblastic markers in two murine tumor models. Profiling revealed production of factors associated with ECM deposition and remodeling. Functional in vivo studies showed that co-injection of HSC-CAFs with tumor cells resulted in increased tumor growth rate and significantly larger tumors than tumor cells alone. Immunohistochemical studies revealed increased blood vessel density with co-injection, demonstrating a role for HSC-CAFs in tumor vascularization. Mechanistic in vitro studies indicated that HSC-CAFs play a role in producing vascular endothelial growth factor A and transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b21 in endothelial tube formation and patterning.

The effects of miR-150 and miR-223 on endogenous STAT1 were confirmed using inducible cell lines. Our studies also showed that miR-150 expression is upregulated by interleukin-2 signaling in adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) cells. HTLV-I\u2013transformed and ATL-derived cells have reduced levels of miR150 and miR223 expression, which coincide with increased STAT1 expression and STAT1-dependent signaling. Knockdown of STAT1 by short hairpin RNA demonstrated that the constitutive activation of STAT1 is required for the continuous proliferation of HTLV-I\u2013transformed cells. Our studies further demonstrate that increased expression of STAT1 in ATL cells is associated with higher levels of major histocompatibility complex class I expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that the pressure exerted by natural killer (NK) cells in vivo can edit leukemic tumor cells by forcing an increased expression of major histocompatibility complex class I to escape immune clearance. STAT1-expressing tumor cells produce more aggressive tumors because they cannot be eliminated by NK cells.

     "abstract": "Heterozygous, germline nonsense mutations in AXIN2 have been reported in two families with oligodontia and colorectal cancer (CRC) predisposition, including an AXIN2 1989G>A mutation. Somatic AXIN2 mutations predicted to generate truncated AXIN2 (trAXIN2) proteins have been reported in some CRCs. Our studies of cells from an AXIN2 1989G>A mutation carrier showed that the mutant transcripts are not significantly susceptible to nonsense-mediated decay and, thus, could encode a trAXIN2 protein. In transient transfection assays, trAXIN2 was more abundant than wild-type AXIN2 protein, and in contrast to AXIN2, glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 inhibition did not increase trAXIN2 levels. Like AXIN2, the trAXIN2 protein interacts with \u03b2-catenin destruction complex proteins. When ectopically overexpressed, trAXIN2 inhibits \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor\u2013dependent reporter gene activity and SW480 CRC cell colony formation. These findings suggest the trAXIN2 protein may retain some wild-type functions when highly expressed. However, when stably expressed in rat intestinal IEC-6 cells, the trAXIN2 protein did not match AXIN2\u2019s activity in inhibiting Wnt-mediated induction of Wnt-regulated target genes, and SW480 cells with stable expression of trAXIN2 but not AXIN2 could be generated. Our data suggest the AXIN2 1989G>A mutation may not have solely a loss-of-function role in CRC. Rather, its contribution may depend on context, with potential loss-of-function when AXIN2 levels are low, such as in the absence of Wnt pathway activation. However, given its apparent increased stability in some settings, the trAXIN2 protein might have gain-of-function in cells with substantially elevated AXIN2 expression, such as Wnt pathway\u2013defective CRC cells.",

We have previously reported that DNA-PKcs is required for maintaining chromosomal stability and mitosis progression. Our further investigations reveal that deficiency in DNA-PKcs activity caused a delay in mitotic entry due to dysregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1), the key driving force for cell cycle progression through G2/M transition. Timely activation of Cdk1 requires polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), which affects modulators of Cdk1. We found that DNA-PKcs physically interacts with Plk1 and could facilitate Plk1 activation both in vitro and in vivo. Further, DNA-PKcs\u2013deficient cells are highly sensitive to Plk1 inhibitor BI2536, suggesting that the coordination between DNA-PKcs and Plk1 is not only crucial to ensure normal cell cycle progression through G2/M phases but also required for cellular resistance to mitotic stress. On the basis of the current study, it is predictable that combined inhibition of DNA-PKcs and Plk1 can be employed in cancer therapy strategy for synthetic lethality.",

However, their side effects in hepatitis, cardiovascular diseases, and bladder cancer resulted in some selling restrictions in the USA and Europe. Here, we found that the potential impact of TZDs on the prostate cancer (PCa) progression might be linked to the TR4 nuclear receptor expression. Clinical surveys found that 9% of PCa patients had one allele TR4 deletion in their tumors. TZD increased cell growth and invasion in PCa cells when TR4 was knocked down. In contrast, TZD decreased PCa progression in PCa cells with wild type TR4. Mechanism dissection found that the Harvey Rat Sarcoma (HRAS) oncogene increased on TZD treatment of the TR4 knocked-down CWR22Rv1 and C4-2 cells, and interruption with HRAS inhibitor resulted in reversal of TZD-induced PCa progression. Together, these results suggest that TZD treatment may promote PCa progression depending on the TR4 expression status that may be clinically relevant since extra caution may be needed for those diabetic PCa patients receiving TZD treatment who have one allele TR4 deletion.",

We employed the Illumina GoldenGate genotyping platform to quantitate loss of heterozygosity (LOH) across the genome of primary tumors, revealing strong biases favoring chromosome 4 alleles from the FVB parent. While allelic bias was not observed on other chromosomes, many tumors showed concerted LOH (C-LOH) of all alleles of one or the other parent on sporadic chromosomes, a pattern consistent with cytogenetic observations. Surprisingly, comparison of LOH in tumor samples relative to normal unaffected tissues from these animals revealed significant variegated (stochastic) deviations from heterozygosity (V-LOH) in every tumor genome. Sequence analysis showed expected changes in the allelic frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in cases of C-LOH. However, no evidence of LOH due to mutations, small deletions, or gene conversion at the affected SNPs or surrounding DNA was found at loci with V-LOH. Postulating an epigenetic mechanism contributing to V-LOH, we tested whether methylation of template DNA impacts allele detection efficiency using synthetic oligonucleotide templates in an assay mimicking the GoldenGate genotyping format. Methylated templates were systematically over-scored, suggesting that the observed patterns of V-LOH may represent extensive epigenetic DNA modifications across the tumor genomes. As most of the SNPs queried do not contain standard (CpG) methylation targets, we propose that widespread, non-canonical DNA modifications occur during Her2/neuT-driven tumorigenesis.",

In this study, we identified acquired resistance to IGF-1R blockade with R1507, an antibody against IGF-1R, and with BMS-754807, a small molecular inhibitor of IGF-1R/insulin receptor (IR). We showed that treatment with an IGF-IR antibody, R1507, or an IR/IGF-IR kinase inhibitor, BMS-754807, was associated with increased activation of YES/SRC family tyrosine kinase (SFK) in rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Combining anti\u2013IGF-1R agents with SFK inhibitors resulted in blockade of IGF-1R inhibition\u2013induced activation of YES/SFK and displayed advantageous antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo. Our data provide evidence that IGF-1R blockade results in activation of the YES/SRC family kinase bypass resistance pathway in vitro and in vivo. This may be of particular clinical relevance since both Yes and IGF components are overexpressed in RMS. Increased YES/SFK activation might serve as a clinical biomarker for predicting tumor resistance to IGF-1R inhibition.

The functions of PTEN are regulated by a variety of posttranslational modifications such as acetylation, oxidation, ubiquitylation, phosphorylation, and SUMOylation. However, methylation of PTEN has not been reported so far. In this study, we demonstrated that the oncogenic protein lysine methyltransferase SET and MYND domain containing 2 (SMYD2) methylates PTEN at lysine 313 in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of SMYD2 suppressed the cell growth of breast cancer cells and attenuated phosphorylation levels of AKT, indicating that SMYD2-mediated methylation negatively regulates PTEN tumor suppressor activity and results in activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT pathway. Furthermore, PTEN protein with lysine 313 substitution diminished phosphorylation of PTEN at serine 380, which is known to inactivate tumor suppressor functions of PTEN.

However, understanding their diversity and plasticity constitute one of the most challenging areas of research due to the paucity of models to study these cells' inherent complexity. Herein, we analyzed the role of monocytes/macrophages in glioma growth by using a transgenic model that allows for conditional ablation of this cell population. We modeled glioma using intracranial GL261-bearing CSF-1R\u2013GFP+ macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (MAFIA) transgenic mice. Conditional macrophage ablation was achieved by exposure to the dimerizer AP20187. Double immunofluorescence was used to characterize M1- and M2-like monocytes/macrophages during tumor growth and after conditional ablation. During glioma growth, the monocyte/macrophage population consisted predominantly of M2 macrophages. Conditional temporal depletion of macrophages reduced the number of GFP+ cells, targeting mainly the repopulation of M2-polarized cells, and altered the appearance of M1-like monocytes/macrophages, which suggested a shift in the M1/M2 macrophage balance. Of interest, compared with control-treated mice, macrophage-depleted mice had a lower tumor mitotic index, microvascular density, and reduced tumor growth. These results demonstrated the possibility of studying in vivo the role and phenotype of macrophages in gliomas and suggested that transitory depletion of CSF-1R+ population influences the reconstitutive phenotypic pool of these cells, ultimately suppressing tumor growth. The MAFIA model provides a much needed advance in defining the role of macrophages in gliomas.",

To address these challenges, we predefined the catalog of relevant solid tumor somatic genome variants (gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations, high-level copy number alterations, and gene fusions) through comprehensive bioinformatics analysis of >700,000 samples. To detect these variants, we developed the Oncomine Comprehensive Panel (OCP), an integrative NGS-based assay [compatible with <\u00a020 ng of DNA/RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues], coupled with an informatics pipeline to specifically identify relevant predefined variants and created a knowledge base of related potential treatments, current practice guidelines, and open clinical trials. We validated OCP using molecular standards and more than 300 FFPE tumor samples, achieving >95% accuracy for KRAS, epidermal growth factor receptor, and BRAF mutation detection as well as for ALK and TMPRSS2:ERG gene fusions. Associating positive variants with potential targeted treatments demonstrated that 6% to 42% of profiled samples (depending on cancer type) harbored alterations beyond routine molecular testing that were associated with approved or guideline-referenced therapies. As a translational research tool, OCP identified adaptive CTNNB1 amplifications/mutations in treated prostate cancers. Through predefining somatic variants in solid tumors and compiling associated potential treatment strategies, OCP represents a simplified, broadly applicable targeted NGS system with the potential to advance precision oncology efforts.",

Despite advances in conventional treatment, the outcome for patients remains almost universally fatal. This poor prognosis is due to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence after surgical removal. However, over the past decade, molecular targeted therapy has held the promise of transforming the care of malignant glioma patients. Significant progress in understanding the molecular pathology of gliomagenesis and maintenance of the malignant phenotypes will open opportunities to rationally develop new molecular targeted therapy options. Recently, therapeutic strategies have focused on targeting pro-growth signaling mediated by receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, proangiogenic pathways, and several other vital intracellular signaling networks, such as proteasome and histone deacetylase. However, several factors such as cross-talk between the altered pathways, intratumoral molecular heterogeneity, and therapeutic resistance of glioma stem cells (GSCs) have limited the activity of single agents. Efforts are ongoing to study in depth the complex molecular biology of glioma, develop novel regimens targeting GSCs, and identify biomarkers to stratify patients with the individualized molecular targeted therapy. Here, we review the molecular alterations relevant to the pathology of malignant glioma, review current advances in clinical targeted trials, and discuss the challenges, controversies, and future directions of molecular targeted therapy.",

We report here that, in addition to the membranous form, ABCG2 proteins are also found inside the nucleus, where they bind to the E-box of CDH1 (E-cadherin) promoter and regulate transcription of this gene. Increased expression of ABCG2 causes an increase of E-cadherin and attenuates cell migration, whereas knockdown of ABCG2 downregulates E-cadherin and enhances cell motility. In mice, xenografted A549 cells that have less ABCG2 are more likely to metastasize from the subcutaneous inoculation site to the internal organs. However, for the cancer cells that have already entered the blood circulation, an increased level of ABCG2, and correspondingly increased E-cadherin, may facilitate circulating cancer cells to colonize at a distant site and form a metastatic tumor.

This study aimed to evaluate risk factors for local relapse (LR) and lymph node metastasis (LNM) and their impact on progression-free survival (PFS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a retrospective monocentric study, patients with BSC-HN treated between 1999 and 2011 were analyzed regarding clinical and histologic characteristics. Prognostic parameters for LR, LNM, and PFS were evaluated. In total, 89 patients (55 male, 34 female, mean age of 71.8 years) with a mean follow-up time of 47.7 months (range 12-112) were included. RESULTS: LR occurred in four patients (4.5%), LNM occurred in five patients (5.6%). Patients with LNM had a significantly shorter PFS time (16.1 months) compared with patients without LNM (154.2 months; P < .001). Tumor depth and size (T classification), incomplete resection, localization at the ear, deep maximal vertical infiltration, muscle and vessel invasion all showed significant (P < .05) associations with LR, LNM, and shorter PFS time. BSC showed more histologic features of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), especially with regard to BerEP4 expression. CONCLUSION: While histology shows some typical characteristics of BCC, the biologic behavior and aggressiveness of BSC are similar to those of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This is the first study to show that LR and, especially, LNM indicate a higher risk of an unfavorable outcome.",

     "abstract": "A substantial proportion of colorectal cancers (CRCs) are interval CRCs (I-CRCs; i.e., CRCs diagnosed soon after a colonoscopy). Chromosomal instability (CIN) is defined as an increase in the rate of which whole chromosomes/large chromosomal fragments are gained or lost and is observed in 85% of non-hereditary CRCs. The contribution of CIN to the etiology of I-CRCs remains unknown. We established a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach to characterize CIN by enumerating specific chromosomes and determined the prevalence of numerical CIN in a population-based cohort of I-CRCs and control (sporadic) CRCs. Using the population-based Manitoba Health administrative databases and Manitoba Cancer Registry, we identified an age, sex, and colonic site of CRC matched cohort of I-CRCs and controls and retrieved their archived paraffin-embedded tumor samples. FISH chromosome enumeration probes specifically recognizing the pericentric regions of chromosomes 8, 11, and 17 were first used on cell lines and then CRC tissue microarrays to detect aneusomy, which was then used to calculate a CIN score (CS). The 15th percentile CS for control CRC was used to define CIN phenotype. Mean CSs were similar in the control CRCs and I-CRCs; 82% of I-CRCs exhibited a CIN phenotype, which was similar to that in the control CRCs.

     "abstract": "Transforming growth factor\u2013\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) functions to suppress tumorigenesis in normal mammary tissues and early-stage breast cancers and, paradoxically, acts to promote the metastasis and chemoresistance in late-stage breast cancers, particularly triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs). Precisely how TGF-\u03b2 acquires oncogenic characteristics in late-stage breast cancers remains unknown, as does the role of the endogenous mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, Dep domain\u2013containing mTOR-interacting protein (Deptor), in coupling TGF-\u03b2 to TNBC development and metastatic progression. Here we demonstrate that Deptor expression was downregulated in basal-like/TNBCs relative to their luminal counterparts. Additionally, Deptor expression was 1) inversely correlated with the metastatic ability of human (MCF10A) and mouse (4T1) TNBC progression series and 2) robustly repressed by several inducers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition programs. Functional disruption of Deptor expression in 4T07 cells significantly inhibited their proliferation and organoid growth in vitro, as well as prevented their colonization and tumor formation in the lungs of mice. In stark contrast, elevated Deptor expression was significantly associated with poorer overall survival of patients harboring estrogen receptor \u03b1\u2013negative breast cancers. Accordingly, enforced Deptor expression in MDA-MB-231 cells dramatically enhanced their 1) organoid growth in vitro, 2) pulmonary outgrowth in mice, and 3) resistance to chemotherapies, an event dependent on the coupling of Deptor to survivin expression. Collectively, our findings highlight the dichotomous functions of Deptor in modulating the proliferation and survival of TNBCs during metastasis; they also implicate Deptor and its stimulation of survivin as essential components of TNBC resistance to chemotherapies and apoptotic stimuli.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal cancers principally because of early invasion and metastasis. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is essential for PDAC development even in the presence of Kras, but its inhibition with erlotinib gives only a modest clinical response, making the discovery of novel EGFR targets of critical interest. Here, we revealed by mining a human pancreatic gene expression database that the metastasis promoter Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE1) associates with the EGFR in PDAC. In human PDAC cell lines, we confirmed that NHE1 drives both basal and EGF-stimulated three-dimensional growth and early invasion via invadopodial extracellular matrix digestion. EGF promoted the complexing of EGFR with NHE1 via the scaffolding protein Na\u00a0+/H\u00a0+ exchanger regulatory factor 1, engaging EGFR in a negative transregulatory loop that controls the extent and duration of EGFR oncogenic signaling and stimulates NHE1. The specificity of NHE1 for growth or invasion depends on the segregation of the transient EGFR/Na\u00a0+/H\u00a0+ exchanger regulatory factor 1/NHE1 signaling complex into dimeric subcomplexes in different lipid raftlike membrane domains. This signaling complex was also found in tumors developed in orthotopic mice. Importantly, the specific NHE1 inhibitor cariporide reduced both three-dimensional growth and invasion independently of PDAC subtype and synergistically sensitized these behaviors to low doses of erlotinib.",

     "abstract": "Intratubular germ cell neoplasia, the precursor of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), is hypothesized to arise during embryogenesis from developmentally arrested primordial germ cells (PGCs) or gonocytes. In early embryonal life, the PGCs migrate from the yolk sac to the dorsal body wall where the cell population separates before colonizing the genital ridges. However, whether the malignant transformation takes place before or after this separation is controversial. We have explored the somatic exome-wide mutational spectra of bilateral TGCT to provide novel insight into the in utero critical time frame of malignant transformation and TGCT pathogenesis. Exome sequencing was performed in five patients with bilateral TGCT (eight tumors), of these three patients in whom both tumors were available (six tumors) and two patients each with only one available tumor (two tumors). Selected loci were explored by Sanger sequencing in 71 patients with bilateral TGCT. From the exome-wide mutational spectra, no identical mutations in any of the three bilateral tumor pairs were identified. Exome sequencing of all eight tumors revealed 87 somatic non-synonymous mutations (median 10 per tumor; range 5-21), some in already known cancer genes such as CIITA, NEB, platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 (PDGFRA), and WHSC1. SUPT6H was found recurrently mutated in two tumors. We suggest independent development lineages of bilateral TGCT. Thus, malignant transformation into intratubular germ cell neoplasia is likely to occur after the migration of PGCs. We reveal possible drivers of TGCT pathogenesis, such as mutated PDGFRA, potentially with therapeutic implications for TGCT patients.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a deadly disease characterized by metastatic progression and resistance to conventional therapeutics. Mutation of KRAS is the most frequent early event in pancreatic tumor progression. AKT isoforms are frequently activated in pancreatic cancer, and reports have implicated hyperactivation of AKT1, as well as AKT2, in pancreatic tumor formation. The objective here is to delineate the role of AKT in facilitating in vivo pancreatic tumor progression in the context of KRAS mutation and predisposition to pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Mice with Akt1 and KRas mutant alleles expressed using the pancreas Pdx promoter were mated to characterize the incidence and frequency of histologic and genetic alterations known to occur commonly in human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: Active Akt1 (Akt1Myr, containing a myristoylation sequence) cooperated with active mutant KRasG12D to accelerate pancreatic carcinoma onset and progression and increase phosphorylation of downstream effectors in the Akt pathway. Mucin and smooth muscle actin expression was found in and around pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs), and accelerated time to metastasis was found in Akt1Myr/KRasG12D mice. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to prior reports of pancreatic KRas mutant mice mated with mice deficient for various tumor suppressor genes, which resulted in aggressive disease within a few months of age, Akt1Myr/KRasG12D mice enabled the study of PanINs and spontaneous pancreatic transformation more characteristic of human pancreatic progression in elderly individuals. The Akt1Myr/KRasG12D model holds promise for delineating the tumor biology and biomarkers critical for understanding their cooperation in cancer oncogenesis and future targeting in therapeutic strategies.",

We examined and compared the molecular profiles of ULMS and normal myometrium (NL) to identify clinically relevant molecular subtypes. Discovery cases included 29 NL and 23 ULMS specimens. RNA was hybridized to Affymetrix U133A 2.0 transcription microarrays. Differentially expressed genes and pathways were identified using standard methods. Fourteen NL and 44 ULMS independent archival samples were used for external validation. Molecular subgroups were correlated with clinical outcome. Pathway analyses of differentially expressed genes between ULMS and NL samples identified overrepresentation of cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and genomic integrity. External validation confirmed differential expression in 31 genes (P < 4.4 \u00d7 10\u2212\u00a04, Bonferroni corrected), with 84% of the overexpressed genes, including CDC7, CDC20, GTSE1, CCNA2, CCNB1, and CCNB2, participating in cell cycle regulation.

In addition, there are efforts to genetically screen patients for specific mutations in light of attempting to administer specific anticancer agents that are most effective. In this study, we evaluate the anticancer and anti-angiogenic effects of low dose erlotinib-cisplatin combination in NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. In NSCLC cells harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations, combination erlotinib-cisplatin treatment led to synergistic cell death, but there was minimal efficacy in NSCLC cells with wild-type EGFR. In xenograft models, combination treatment also demonstrated greater inhibition of tumor growth compared to individual treatment. The anti-tumor effect observed was secondary to the targeting of angiogenesis, evidenced by decreased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels and decreased levels of CD31 and microvessel density. Combination treatment targets angiogenesis through down-regulation of the c-MYC/hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1) pathway. In fact, cell lines with EGFR exon 19 deletions expressed high basal levels of c-MYC and HIF-1\u03b1 and correlate with robust responses to combination treatment. These results suggest that low dose erlotinib-cisplatin combination exhibits its anti-tumor activity by targeting angiogenesis through the modulation of the c-MYC/HIF-1\u03b1/VEGF pathway in NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions. These findings may have significant clinical implications in patients with tumors harboring EGFR exon 19 deletions as they may be particularly sensitive to this regimen.",

We have investigated the use of in vivo fluorescence imaging using fluorocoxib A as a molecular probe for early detection and assessment of skin tumors in mouse models of NMSC. Fluorocoxib A targets the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme that is preferentially expressed by inflamed and tumor tissue, and therefore has potential to be an effective broadly active molecular biomarker for cancer detection. We tested the sensitivity of fluorocoxib A in a BCC allograft SCID hairless mouse model using a wide-field fluorescence imaging system. Subcutaneous allografts comprised of 1000 BCC cells were detectable above background. These BCC allograft mice were imaged over time and a linear correlation (R2 = 0.8) between tumor volume and fluorocoxib A signal levels was observed. We also tested fluorocoxib A in a genetically engineered spontaneous BCC mouse model (Ptch1+/\u2212 K14-Cre-ER2 p53fl/fl), where sequential imaging of the same animals over time demonstrated that early, microscopic lesions (100 \u03bcm size) developed into visible macroscopic tumor masses over 11 to 17 days. Overall, for macroscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 88% and the specificity was 100%. For microscopic tumors, the sensitivity was 85% and specificity was 56%. These results demonstrate the potential of fluorocoxib A as an in vivo imaging agent for early detection, margin delineation and guided biopsies of NMSCs.",

We studied the performance of raster-scan optoacoustic mesoscopy (RSOM), to directly reveal the vascular network supporting melanoma growth in vivo, at 50 MHz and 100 MHz, through several millimeters of tumor depth. After comparing the performance at each frequency, we recorded, for the first time, high-resolution images of melanin tumor vasculature development in vivo, over a period of several days. Image validation was provided by means of cryo-slice sections of the same tumor after sacrificing the mice.

Nude mice with human RCC xenografts (NU12, SK-RC-52) were treated orally with 0.8 mg/day sunitinib, or vehicle for 7 to 14 days. Three days before start or cessation of treatment mice were injected i.v. with 0.4 MBq/5 \u03bcg 111In-Girentuximab followed by biodistribution studies. Immunohistochemical analyses were performed to study the tumor vasculature and CAIX expression and to confirm Girentuximab uptake.NU12 appeared to represent a sunitinib sensitive tumor: sunitinib treatment resulted in extensive necrosis and decreased microvessel density (MVD). Accumulation of Girentuximab was significantly decreased when sunitinib treatment preceded the antibody injection but remained unchanged when sunitinib followed Girentuximab injection. Cessation of therapy led to a rapid neovascularization, reminiscent of a tumor flare. SK-RC-52 appeared to represent a sunitinib-resistant tumor: (central) tumor necrosis was minimal and MVD was not affected. Sunitinib treatment resulted in increased Girentuximab uptake, regardless of the sequence of treatment. These data indicate that sunitinib can be combined with Girentuximab.

The mesenchymal phenotype is associated with greater aggressiveness and low survival in contrast to GBMs enriched with proneural genes. The proinflammatory cytokines secreted in the microenvironment of gliomas play a key role in tumor progression. The study focused on the role of Oncostatin-M (OSM), an IL-6 family cytokine in inducing mesenchymal properties in GBM. Analysis of TCGA and REMBRANDT data revealed that expression of OSMR but not IL-6R or LIFR is upregulated in GBM and has negative correlation with survival. Amongst the GBM subtypes, OSMR level was in the order of mesenchymal > classical > neural > proneural. TCGA data and RT-PCR analysis in primary cultures of low and high grade gliomas showed a positive correlation between OSMR and mesenchymal signature genes-YKL40/CHI3L1, fibronectin and vimentin and a negative correlation with proneural signature genes-DLL3, Olig2 and BCAN. OSM enhanced transcript and protein level of fibronectin and YKL-40 and reduced the expression of Olig2 and DLL3 in GBM cells. OSM-regulated mesenchymal phenotype was associated with enhanced MMP-9 activity, increased cell migration and invasion. Importantly, OSM induced mesenchymal markers and reduced proneural genes even in primary cultures of grade-III glioma cells. We conclude that OSM-mediated signaling contributes to aggressive nature associated with mesenchymal features via STAT3 signaling in glioma cells.

Thus, it is crucial to define and clarify the different spherical cancer models thus far described. Here, we focus on in vitro multicellular spheres used in cancer research. All these spherelike structures are characterized by their well-rounded shape, the presence of cancer cells, and their capacity to be maintained as free-floating cultures. We propose a rational classification of the four most commonly used spherical cancer models in cancer research based on culture methods for obtaining them and on subsequent differences in sphere biology: the multicellular tumor spheroid model, first described in the early 70s and obtained by culture of cancer cell lines under nonadherent conditions; tumorospheres, a model of cancer stem cell expansion established in a serum-free medium supplemented with growth factors; tissue-derived tumor spheres and organotypic multicellular spheroids, obtained by tumor tissue mechanical dissociation and cutting. In addition, we describe their applications to and interest in cancer research; in particular, we describe their contribution to chemoresistance, radioresistance, tumorigenicity, and invasion and migration studies. Although these models share a common 3D conformation, each displays its own intrinsic properties. Therefore, the most relevant spherical cancer model must be carefully selected, as a function of the study aim and cancer type.",

TWIST1 is a dimeric basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor existing as TWIST1-TWIST1 or TWIST1-E12/47. TWIST1 partner choice and DNA binding can be influenced during development by phosphorylation of Thr125 and Ser127 of the Thr-Gln-Ser (TQS) motif within the bHLH of TWIST1. The significance of these TWIST1 phosphorylation sites for metastasis is unknown. We created stable isogenic prostate cancer cell lines overexpressing TWIST1 wild-type, phospho-mutants, and tethered versions. We assessed these isogenic lines using assays that mimic stages of cancer metastasis. In vitro assays suggested the phospho-mimetic Twist1-DQD mutation could confer cellular properties associated with pro-metastatic behavior. The hypo-phosphorylation mimic Twist1-AQA mutation displayed reduced pro-metastatic activity compared to wild-type TWIST1 in vitro, suggesting that phosphorylation of the TWIST1 TQS motif was necessary for pro-metastatic functions. In vivo analysis demonstrates that the Twist1-AQA mutation exhibits reduced capacity to contribute to metastasis, whereas the expression of the Twist1-DQD mutation exhibits proficient metastatic potential. Tethered TWIST1-E12 heterodimers phenocopied the Twist1-DQD mutation for many in vitro assays, suggesting that TWIST1 phosphorylation may result in heterodimerization in prostate cancer cells. Lastly, the dual phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor BEZ235 strongly attenuated TWIST1-induced migration that was dependent on the TQS motif. TWIST1 TQS phosphorylation state determines the intensity of TWIST1-induced pro-metastatic ability in prostate cancer cells, which may be partly explained mechanistically by TWIST1 dimeric partner choice.",

Despite overexpression in most cancers and having a role in angiogenesis, inhibition of POP activity has received little attention as an approach to quench tumor growth. We developed two specific and highly effective pseudopeptide inhibitors, M83, which inhibits FAP and POP proteinase activities, and J94, which inhibits only POP. Both suppressed human colon cancer xenograft growth >\u00a090% in mice. By immunohistochemical stains, M83- and J94-treated tumors had fewer microvessels, and apoptotic areas were apparent in both. In response to M83, but not J94, disordered collagen accumulations were observed. Neither M83- nor J94-treated mice manifested changes in behavior, weight, or gastrointestinal function.

Eighty-seven PHEOs/PGLs (48 sporadic/23 SDHx/7 von Hippel-Lindau/5 REarranged during Transfection/3 neurofibromatosis type 1/1 hypoxia-inducible factor 2\u03b1), one SDHD variant of unknown significance, and two Carney triad (CTr)\u2013related tumors were analyzed by HRMAS-NMR spectroscopy. Compared to sporadic, SDHx-related PHEOs/PGLs exhibit a specific metabolic signature characterized by increased levels of succinate (P < .0001), methionine (P = .002), glutamine (P = .002), and myoinositol (P < .0007) and decreased levels of glutamate (P < .0007), regardless of their location and catecholamine levels. Uniquely, ATP/ascorbate/glutathione was found to be associated with the secretory phenotype of PHEOs/PGLs, regardless of their genotype (P < .0007). The use of succinate as a single screening test retained excellent accuracy in distinguishing SDHx versus non\u2013SDHx-related tumors (sensitivity/specificity: 100/100%). Moreover, the quantification of succinate could be considered a diagnostic alternative for assessing SDHx-related mutations of unknown pathogenicity. We were also able, for the first time, to uncover an SDH-like pattern in the two CTr-related PGLs. The present study demonstrates that HRMAS-NMR provides important information for SDHx-related PHEO/PGL characterization. Besides the high succinate\u2013low glutamate hallmark, SDHx tumors also exhibit high values of methionine, a finding consistent with the hypermethylation pattern of these tumors.

Inflammation is another feature of tumor microenvironment and is considered as a new enabling characteristic of tumor progression. As cycling hypoxia is known to participate in tumor aggressiveness, the purpose of this study was to evaluate its role in tumor-promoting inflammation. Firstly, we assessed the impact of cycling hypoxia in vitro on endothelial inflammatory response induced by tumor necrosis factor \u03b1. Results showed that endothelial cells exposed to cycling hypoxia displayed an amplified proinflammatory phenotype, characterized by an increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, namely, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8; by an increased expression of adhesion molecules, in particular intercellular adhesion molecule\u20131 (ICAM-1); and consequently by an increase in THP-1 monocyte adhesion. This exacerbation of endothelial inflammatory phenotype occurs through nuclear factor\u2013\u03baB overactivation. Secondly, the role of cycling hypoxia was studied on overall tumor inflammation in vivo in tumor-bearing mice. Results showed that cycling hypoxia led to an enhanced inflammation in tumors as prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), IL-6, CXCL1 (C-X-C motif ligand 1), and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (murine IL-8 functional homologs) mRNA expression was increased and as a higher leukocyte infiltration was evidenced. Furthermore, cycling hypoxia\u2013specific inflammatory phenotype, characterized by a simultaneous (baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat-containing 5)low/PTGS2high/ICAM-1high/IL-6high/IL-8high expression, is associated with a poor prognosis in human colon cancer. This new phenotype could thus be used in clinic to more precisely define prognosis for colon cancer patients. In conclusion, our findings evidenced for the first time the involvement of cycling hypoxia in tumor-promoting inflammation amplification.",

However, the underlying mechanism of circadian clock disruption in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Here, we report that a long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), highly upregulated in liver cancer (HULC), contributes to the perturbations in circadian rhythm of hepatoma cells. Our observations showed that HULC was able to heighten the expression levels of CLOCK and its downstream circadian oscillators, such as period circadian clock 1 and cryptochrome circadian clock 1, in hepatoma cells. Strikingly, HULC altered the expression pattern and prolonged the periodic expression of CLOCK in hepatoma cells. Mechanistically, the complementary base pairing between HULC and the 5' untranslated region of CLOCK mRNA underlay the HULC-modulated expression of CLOCK, and the mutants in the complementary region failed to achieve the event. Moreover, immunohistochemistry staining and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction validated that the levels of CLOCK were elevated in HCC tissues, and the expression levels of HULC were positively associated with those of CLOCK in clinical HCC samples. In functional experiments, our data exhibited that CLOCK was implicated in the HULC-accelerated proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our data show that an lncRNA, HULC, is responsible for the perturbations in circadian rhythm through upregulating circadian oscillator CLOCK in hepatoma cells, resulting in the promotion of hepatocarcinogenesis. Thus, our finding provides new insights into the mechanism by which lncRNA accelerates hepatocarcinogenesis through disturbing circadian rhythm of HCC.",

     "abstract": "White spotting variant (Wv) mice are spontaneous mutants attributed to a point mutation in the c-Kit gene, which reduces the tyrosine kinase activity to around 1% and affects the development of melanocytes, mast cells, and germ cells. Homozygous mutant mice are sterile but can live nearly a normal life span. The female Wv mice have a greatly reduced ovarian germ cell and follicle reserve at birth, and the remaining follicles are largely depleted soon after the females reach reproductive stage at around 7 weeks of age. Consequently, ovarian epithelial tumors develop in 100% of Wv females by 3 to 4 months of age. These tumors, called tubular adenomas, are benign but can become invasive in older Wv mice.We tested if additional genetic mutation(s) could convert the benign ovarian epithelial tumors to malignant tumors by crossing the Wv mutant into the Trp53 knockout background. Surprisingly, we found that global deletion of Trp53 suppressed the development of ovarian tubular adenomas in Wv mice. The ovaries of Wv/Wv; Trp53 (\u2212/\u2212) mice were covered by a single layer of surface epithelium and lacked excessive epithelial proliferation. Rather, the ovaries contained a small number of follicles. The presence of ovarian follicles and granulosa cells, as indicated by Pgc7 and inhibin-alpha expression, correlated with the absence of epithelial lesions. A reduction of Pten gene dosage, as in Wv/Wv; Pten (+/\u2212) mice, produced a similar, though less dramatic, phenotype. We conclude that deletion of Trp53 prolongs the survival of ovarian follicles in Wv mice and consequently prevents the proliferation of ovarian epithelial cells and development of ovarian tubular adenomas. The results suggest that various cell types within the ovary communicate and mutually modulate, and an intact tissue environment is required to ensure homeostasis of ovarian surface epithelial cells. Especially, the current finding emphasizes the importance of ovarian follicles in suppressing the hyperplastic growth of ovarian epithelial cells, dominating over the loss of p53.",

Highest levels of HPSE activity have been consistently detected in cells possessing highest propensities to colonize the brain, emphasizing the therapeutic potential for targeting HPSE in brain metastatic breast cancer (BMBC). Lapatinib (Tykerb) is a small-molecule and dual inhibitor of human epidermal growth factor receptor1 and 2 (EGFR and HER2, respectively) which are both high-risk predictors of BMBC. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic breast cancer. However, its role is limited in BMBC whose response rates to lapatinib are significantly lower than those for extracranial metastasis. Because HPSE can affect EGFR phosphorylation, we examined Roneparstat, a non-anticoagulant heparin with potent anti-HPSE activity, to inhibit EGFR signaling pathways and BMBC onset using lapatinib-resistant clones generated from HER2-transfected, EGFR-expressing MDA-MB-231BR cells. Cell growth, EGFR pathways, and HPSE targets were assessed among selected clones in the absence or presence of Roneparstat and/or lapatinib. Roneparstat overcame lapatinib resistance by inhibiting pathways associated with EGFR tyrosine residues that are not targeted by lapatinib. Roneparstat inhibited the growth and BMBC abilities of lapatinib-resistant clones. A molecular mechanism was identified by which HPSE mediates an alternative survival pathway in lapatinib-resistant clones and is modulated by Roneparstat. These results demonstrate that the inhibition of HPSE-mediated signaling plays important roles in lapatinib resistance, and provide mechanistic insights to validate the use of Roneparstat for novel BMBC therapeutic strategies.",

Here we investigated the role of Sag/Rbx2 E3 ligase in cellular senescence and immortalization of mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and report that Sag is required for proper cell proliferation and KrasG12D-induced immortalization. Sag inactivation by genetic deletion remarkably suppresses cell proliferation by inducing senescence, which is associated with accumulation of p16, but not p53. Mechanistically, Sag deletion caused accumulation of Jun-B, a substrate of Sag-Fbxw7 E3 ligase and a transcription factor that drives p16 transcription. Importantly, senescence triggered by Sag deletion can be largely rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a, the p16 encoding gene, indicating its causal role. Furthermore, KrasG12D-induced immortalization can also be abrogated by Sag deletion via senescence induction, which is again rescued by simultaneous deletion of Cdkn2a. Finally, we found that Sag deletion inactivates KrasG12D activity and block the MAPK signaling pathway, together with accumulated p16, to induce senescence. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Sag is a KrasG12D-cooperating oncogene required for KrasG12D-induced immortalization and transformation, and targeting SAG-SCF E3 ligase may, therefore, have therapeutic value for senescence-based cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Numerous studies by our lab and others demonstrate that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays critical roles in primary breast cancer (BC) initiation, growth and dissemination. However, clinical trials targeting EGFR function in BC have lead to disappointing results. In the current study we sought to identify the mechanisms responsible for this disparity by investigating the function of EGFR across the continuum of the metastatic cascade. We previously established that overexpression of EGFR is sufficient for formation of in situ primary tumors by otherwise nontransformed murine mammary gland cells. Induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is sufficient to drive the metastasis of these EGFR-transformed tumors. Examining growth factor receptor expression across this and other models revealed a potent downregulation of EGFR through metastatic progression. Consistent with diminution of EGFR following EMT and metastasis EGF stimulation changes from a proliferative to an apoptotic response in in situ versus metastatic tumor cells, respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of EGFR in metastatic MDA-MB-231 BC cells promoted their antitumorigenic response to EGF in three dimensional (3D) metastatic outgrowth assays. In line with the paradoxical function of EGFR through EMT and metastasis we demonstrate that the EGFR inhibitory molecule, Mitogen Induced Gene-6 (Mig6), is tumor suppressive in in situ tumor cells. However, Mig6 expression is absolutely required for prevention of apoptosis and ultimate metastasis of MDA-MB-231 cells. Further understanding of the paradoxical function of EGFR between primary and metastatic tumors will be essential for application of its targeted molecular therapies in BC.",

Additionally, a second cohort encompassing 143 consecutively recruited patients of a single oncology center were analyzed. The frequency of additional malignant neoplasms in GIST patients was 31.9% and 42.0% in both cohorts with a mean follow-up time of 54 and 65 months (median 48 and 60 months), respectively. The spectrum of additional neoplasms in both cohorts encompasses gastrointestinal tumors (43.5%), uro-genital and breast cancers (34.1%), hematological malignancies (7.3%), skin cancer (7.3%) and others. Additional neoplasms have had a significant impact on patient outcome. The five year overall survival in GIST with additional malignant neoplasms (n = 267) was 62.8% compared to 83.4% in patients without other tumors (n = 569) (P < .001, HR=0.397, 95% CI: 0.298-0.530). Five-year disease specific survival was not different between both groups (90.8% versus 90.9%). 34.2% of all deaths (n = 66 of n = 193) were GIST-related.

     "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) where it has been shown to promote tumor cell invasion upon phosphorylation. One mechanism by which EGFR promotes tumor progression is by activating signal cascades that lead to loss of E-cadherin, a transmembrane glycoprotein of the cell-cell adherence junctions; however mediators of these signaling cascades are not fully understood. One such mediator, RhoC, is activated upon a number of external stimuli, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), but its role as a mediator of EGF-stimulated migration and invasion has not been elucidated in HNSCC. In the present study, we investigate the role of RhoC as a mediator of EGF-stimulated migration and invasion in HNSCC. We show that upon EGF stimulation, EGFR and RhoC were strongly activated in HNSCC. This resulted in activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Akt pathway (PI3K-Akt), phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 at the Ser9 residue, and subsequent down regulation of E-cadherin cell surface expression resulting in increased tumor cell invasion. Knockdown of RhoC restored E-cadherin expression and inhibited EGF-stimulated migration and invasion. This is the first report in HNSCC demonstrating the role RhoC plays in mediating EGF-stimulated migration and invasion by down-regulating the PI3K-Akt pathway and E-cadherin expression.

However, studies of MB progression in mouse models are difficult due to the heterogeneity of tumor onset times and growth patterns and the lack of clinical symptoms at early stages.

The high tissue contrast obtained with MEMRI revealed detailed cerebellar morphology and enabled detection of MBs over a wide range of stages including pretumoral lesions as early as 2 to 3 weeks postnatal with volumes close to 0.1 mm3. Furthermore, longitudinal MEMRI allowed noninvasive monitoring of tumors and demonstrated that lesions within and between individuals have different tumorigenic potentials. 3D volumetric studies allowed quantitative analysis of MB tumor morphology and growth rates in individual Ptch1-CKO mice.

The proteolytic cleavage allows the Jagged1 intracellular domain to empower Notch signaling activity and to increase the transcriptional activation of Jagged1 itself (autocrine effect).

A tumor entity that is largely resistant to DNA-damaging therapies including chemo- or radiotherapy is renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This study was designed to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of DNA damage resistance in RCC to develop strategies to resensitize tumor cells to DNA damage\u2013induced apoptosis. Here, we show that apoptosis-resistant RCC cells have a disconnect between activation of p53 and upregulation of the downstream proapoptotic protein p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA). We demonstrate that this disconnect is not caused by gene-specific repression through CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) but instead by aberrant chromatin compaction. Treatment with an HDAC inhibitor was found to effectively reactivate PUMA expression on the mRNA and protein level and to revert resistance to DNA damage\u2013induced cell death. Ectopic expression of PUMA was found to resensitize a panel of RCC cell lines to four different DNA-damaging agents tested. Remarkably, all RCC cell lines analyzed were wild-type for p53, and a knockdown was likewise able to sensitize RCC cells to acute genotoxic stress. Taken together, our results indicate that DNA damage resistance in RCC is reversible, involves the p53-PUMA axis, and is potentially targetable to improve the oncological outcomes of RCC patients.",

     "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that the resistance of CLL cells to apoptosis is partly mediated through the interactions between leukemia cells and adjacent stromal cells residing in the lymphatic tissue or bone marrow microenvironment. Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein that is associated with failure to treatment is up-regulated in CLL lymphocytes after interaction with microenvironment. However, the regulation of its expression in context to microenvironment is unclear. We evaluated and compared changes in Mcl-1 in CLL B-cells in suspension culture and when co-cultured on stromal cells. The blockade of apoptosis in co-cultured CLL cells is associated with diminution in caspase-3 and PARP cleavage and is not dependent on cytogenetic profile or prognostic factors of the disease. Stroma-derived resistance to apoptosis is associated with a cascade of transcriptional events such as increase in levels of total RNA Pol II and its phosphorylation at Ser2 and Ser5, increase in the rate of global RNA synthesis, and amplification of Mcl-1 transcript levels. The latter is associated with increase in Mcl-1 protein level without an impact on the levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Post-translational modifications of protein kinases show increased phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473, Erk at Thr202/Tyr204 and Gsk-3\u03b2 at Ser9 and augmentation of total Mcl-1 accumulation along with phosphorylation at Ser159/Thr163 sites. Collectively, stroma-induced apoptosis resistance is mediated through signaling proteins that regulate transcriptional and translational expression and post-translational modification of Mcl-1 in CLL cells in context to bone marrow stromal microenvironment.",

     "abstract": "Most triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) exhibit gene expression patterns associated with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a feature that correlates with a propensity for metastatic spread. Overexpression of the EMT regulator Slug is detected in basal and mesenchymal-type TNBCs and is associated with reduced E-cadherin expression and aggressive disease. The effects of Slug depend, in part, on the interaction of its N-terminal SNAG repressor domain with the chromatin-modifying protein lysine demethylase 1 (LSD1); thus, we investigated whether tranylcypromine [also known as trans-2-phenylcyclopropylamine hydrochloride (PCPA) or Parnate], an inhibitor of LSD1 that blocks its interaction with Slug, suppresses the migration, invasion, and metastatic spread of TNBC cell lines. We show here that PCPA treatment induces the expression of E-cadherin and other epithelial markers and markedly suppresses migration and invasion of TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT-549. These effects were phenocopied by Slug or LSD1 silencing. In two models of orthotopic breast cancer, PCPA treatment reduced local tumor growth and the number of lung metastases. In mice injected directly in the blood circulation with MDA-MB-231 cells, PCPA treatment or Slug silencing markedly inhibited bone metastases but had no effect on lung infiltration. Thus, blocking Slug activity may suppress the metastatic spread of TNBC and, perhaps, specifically inhibit homing/colonization to the bone.",

The possibility of functional interactions between EZH2 and ZBTB4 was investigated in breast cancer cells and the results showed that EZH2 is directly suppressed by ZBTB4 which in turn is regulated (suppressed) by miR-106b and other paralogues from the miR-17-92, miR-106b-25 and miR-106a-363 clusters that are highly expressed in breast and other tumors. ZBTB4 also acts a suppressor of specificity protein (Sp) transcription factors Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4, and RNA interference studies show that Sp proteins are required for EZH2 expression. The prediction analysis results from breast cancer patient array data sets confirm an association of Sp1-dependent EZH2 gene signature with decreased survival of breast cancer patients. Disruption of oncogenic miR-ZBTB4 signaling axis by anticancer agent such as betulinic acid that induce down-regulation of Sp proteins in breast cancer cells resulted in inhibition of tumor growth and colonization of breast cancer cells in a mouse model. Thus, EZH2 is reciprocally regulated by a novel signaling network consisting of Sp proteins, oncogenic miRs and ZBTB4, and modulation of this gene network is a novel therapeutic approach for treatment of breast cancer and possibly other cancers.",

However, induction of HIF-1\u03b1, target of pVHL E3 ligase, is more adequate to angiogenesis step after tumor mass formation. Concerning this, it has been reported that pVHL is involved in centrosome location during metaphase and regulates ER-\u03b1 signaling. Here, we provide the evidences that pVHL-mediated ER-\u03b1 suppression is critical for microtubule organizing center (MTOC) maintaining and elevated ER-\u03b1 promotes MTOC amplification through disruption of BRCA1-Rad51 interaction. In fact, numerous MTOC in VHL- or BRCA1-deficient cells are reduced by Fulvestrant, inhibitor of ER-\u03b1 expression as well as antagonist. In addition, we reveal that activation of ER signaling can increase \u03b3-tubulin, core factor of TuRC and render the resistance to Taxol. Thus, Fulvestrant but not Tamoxifen, antagonist against ER-\u03b1, can restore the Taxol sensitivity in VHL- or BRCA1-deficient cells.

We previously reported that hypoxia could promote gastric cancer (GC) metastasis, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as important regulators of carcinogenesis that act on multiple pathways. However, whether lncRNAs are involved in hypoxia-induced GC metastasis remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the differentially expressed lncRNAs resulting from hypoxia-induced GC and normoxia conditions using microarrays and validated our results through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found an lncRNA, AK058003, that is upregulated by hypoxia. AK058003 is frequently upregulated in GC samples and promotes GC migration and invasion in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, AK058003 can mediate the metastasis of hypoxia-induced GC cells. Next, we identified \u03b3-synuclein (SNCG), which is a metastasis-related gene regulated by AK058003. In addition, we found that the expression of SNCG is positively correlated with that of AK058003 in the clinical GC samples used in our study. Furthermore, we found that the SNCG gene CpG island methylation was significantly increased in GC cells depleted of AK058003. Intriguingly, SNCG expression is also increased by hypoxia, and SNCG upregulation by AK058003 mediates hypoxia-induced GC cell metastasis. These results advance our understanding of the role of lncRNA-AK058003 as a regulator of hypoxia signaling, and this newly identified hypoxia/lncRNA-AK058003/SNCG pathway may help in the development of new therapeutics.",

First of all, we observed down-regulation of p-extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 and up-regulation of dual specific phosphatase 6 (DUSP6) in the PTC with B-RafV600E mutation. DUSP6 overexpression in vitro induced extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 dephosphorylation and inhibited B-RafV600E\u2013induced senescence in thyrocytes. Although DUSP6 protein was degraded by B-RafV600E\u2013induced reactive oxygen species (ROS), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) stabilized DUSP6 protein by increasing Mn superoxide dismutase expression and inhibited B-RafV600E\u2013induced senescence. Although serum TSH was not increased, its receptor was markedly upregulated in PTC with B-RafV600E. Furthermore, TSH together with DUSP6 reactivated Ras signaling, resulted in activation of Ras/AKT/glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2, and stabilized c-Myc protein by inhibiting its degradation.

Based on these findings, we sought to develop an RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) assay for SChLAP1 to 1) investigate the spectrum of SChLAP1 expression from benign prostatic tissue to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and 2) to determine whether SChLAP1 expression by ISH is associated with outcome after radical prostatectomy in patients with clinically localized disease.

Its function in tumorigenesis appears contradictory though, showing both tumor suppressor and tumor promoting activities. In this study, we examined whether and how Klf5 functions in prostatic tumorigenesis using mice with prostate-specific deletion of Klf5 and phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten), both of which are frequently inactivated in human prostate cancer. Histologic analysis demonstrated that when one Pten allele was deleted, which causes mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN), Klf5 deletion accelerated the emergence and progression of mPIN. When both Pten alleles were deleted, which causes prostate cancer, Klf5 deletion promoted tumor growth, increased cell proliferation, and caused more severe morphologic and molecular alterations. Homozygous deletion of Klf5 was more effective than hemizygous deletion. Unexpectedly, while Pten deletion alone expanded basal cell population in a tumor as reported, Klf5 deletion in the Pten-null background clearly reduced basal cell population while expanding luminal cell population. Global gene expression profiling, pathway analysis, and experimental validation indicate that multiple mechanisms could mediate the tumor-promoting effect of Klf5 deletion, including the up-regulation of epidermal growth factor and its downstream signaling molecules AKT and ERK and the inactivation of the p15 cell cycle inhibitor. KLF5 also appears to cooperate with several transcription factors, including CREB1, Sp1, Myc, ER and AR, to regulate gene expression. These findings validate the tumor suppressor function of KLF5. They also yield a mouse model that shares two common genetic alterations with human prostate cancer\u2014mutation/deletion of Pten and deletion of Klf5.",

Accurate identification of tissue of origin would allow for directed, personalized therapies to improve clinical outcomes. Our objective was to use transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) to identify lineage-specific biomarker signatures for the cancer types that most commonly metastasize as CUP (colorectum, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, pancreas, prostate, and stomach). RNA-Seq data of 17,471 transcripts from a total of 3,244 cancer samples across 26 different tissue types were compiled from in-house sequencing data and publically available International Cancer Genome Consortium and The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Robust cancer biomarker signatures were extracted using a 10-fold cross-validation method of log transformation, quantile normalization, transcript ranking by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and stepwise logistic regression. The entire algorithm was then repeated with a new set of randomly generated training and test sets, yielding highly concordant biomarker signatures. External validation of the cancer-specific signatures yielded high sensitivity (92.0% \u00b1 3.15%; mean \u00b1 standard deviation) and specificity (97.7% \u00b1 2.99%) for each cancer biomarker signature. The overall performance of this RNA-Seq biomarker-generating algorithm yielded an accuracy of 90.5%.

We first analyzed clinical correlation between the levels of fibroblasts and cancer progression and found that the level of CAFs made a noticeable difference on the prognosis of patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In vivo animal study also demonstrated that tumor volume depended on the dose of CAFs that was co-injected with OSCC cells. The same tendency was observed in an in vitro study. We also found that interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) secreted from OSCC cells had dual effects on CAFs: IL-1\u03b1 not only promoted the proliferation of CAFs but also upregulated the secretion of cytokines in CAFs such as CCL7, CXCL1, and IL-8. The induction activity of cytokine secretion by IL-1\u03b1 surpassed that of proliferation in OSCC cells. In summary, we unraveled an important interactive mechanism of carcinogenesis: IL-1\u03b1 released from carcinoma stimulates the proliferation of CAFs and the simultaneous increase in cytokine secretion from CAFs promotes cancer progression in human OSCC. On the basis of these findings, we propose that the level of CAFs is eligible for being selected as a prognostic factor that will be useful in routine diagnosis. We also propose that blockage of reciprocal interaction between cancer cells and CAFs will provide an insight for developing novel chemotherapeutic strategy.",

In this study, we experimentally determined whether CNB of breast cancer tumors results in increased distant metastases and examine important resultant changes in the primary tumor and tumor microenvironment associated with this outcome. METHOD: To evaluate the effect of CNB on metastasis development, we implanted murine mammary 4T1 tumor cells in BALB/c mice and performed CNB on palpable tumors in half the mice. Subsequently, emulating the human scenario, all mice underwent complete tumor excision and were allowed to recover, with attendant metastasis development. Tumor growth, lung metastasis, circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels, variation in gene expression, composition of the tumor microenvironment, and changes in immunologic markers were compared in biopsied and non-biopsied mice. RESULTS: Mice with biopsied tumors developed significantly more lung metastases compared to non-biopsied mice. Tumors from biopsied mice contained a higher frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) accompanied by reduced CD4\u00a0+ T cells, CD8\u00a0+ T cells, and macrophages, suggesting biopsy-mediated development of an increasingly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We also observed a CNB-dependent up-regulation in the expression of SOX4, Ezh2, and other key epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) genes, as well as increased CTC levels among the biopsy group. CONCLUSION: CNB creates an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, increases EMT, and facilitates release of CTCs, all of which likely contribute to the observed increase in development of distant metastases.",

However, the mechanism underlying the induction of FOXM1 in HPV 16/18\u2013infected cancers remains elusive. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The mechanistic actions of FOXM1 induced by the E6/NKX2-1 axis in tumor aggressiveness were elucidated in cellular and animal models. The prognostic value of FOXM1 for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) in HPV-positive oral and lung cancers was assessed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression models. RESULTS: Herein, FOXM1 expression is upregulated by E6-mediated NKX2-1 in HPV-positive cervical, oral, and lung cancer cells. Induction of FOXM1 by E6 through the MZF1/NKX2-1 axis is responsible for HPV-mediated soft agar growth, invasiveness, and stemness through activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. In a nude mice model, metastatic lung tumor nodules in HPV 18 E6-positive GNM or HPV 16 E6-positive TL-1\u2013injected nude mice were markedly decreased in both cell types with E6 knockdown, FOXM1 knockdown, or treatment with FOXM1 inhibitor (thiostrepton). Among the four subgroup patients, the worst FOXM1 prognostic value for OS and RFS was observed in HPV 16/18\u2013positive patients with tumors with high-expressing FOXM1. CONCLUSIONS: Induction of FOXM1 by E6 oncoprotein through the MZF1/NKX2-1 axis may be responsible for HPV 16/18\u2013mediated tumor progression and poor outcomes in HPV-positive patients.",

The effect of E7080 on cell viability was examined on 10 human CRC cell lines and human endothelial cells (HUVEC). The inhibitory effect of E7080 on VEGF-induced angiogenesis was studied in an ex vivo mouse aortic ring angiogenesis assay. In addition, the efficacy of E7080 against xenografts derived from CRC cell lines and CRC patient resection specimens with mutated KRAS was investigated in vivo. A relatively low cytotoxic effect of E7080 on CRC cell viability was observed in vitro. Endothelial cells (HUVEC) were more susceptible to the incubation with E7080. This is in line with the observation that E7080 demonstrated an anti-angiogenic effect in a three-dimensional ex vivo mouse aortic ring angiogenesis assay. E7080 effectively disrupted CRC cell-mediated VEGF-stimulated growth of HUVEC in vitro. Daily in vivo treatment with E7080 (5 mg/kg) significantly delayed the growth of KRAS mutated CRC xenografts with decreased density of tumor-associated vessel formations and without tumor regression. This observation is in line with results that E7080 did not significantly reduce the number of Ki67-positive cells in CRC xenografts.

We investigated ATM and Chk2 protein levels in two cohorts [cohort 1 (n = 1650) and cohort 2 (n = 252)]. ATM and Chk2 mRNA expression was evaluated in the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium cohort (n = 1950). Low nuclear ATM protein level was significantly associated with aggressive breast cancer including larger tumors, higher tumor grade, higher mitotic index, pleomorphism, tumor type, lymphovascular invasion, estrogen receptor (ER)\u2212, PR\u00a0\u2212, AR\u00a0\u2212, triple-negative, and basal-like phenotypes (Ps < .05). Breast cancer 1, early onset negative, low XRCC1, low SMUG1, high FEN1, high MIB1, p53 mutants, low MDM2, low Bcl-2, low p21, low Bax, high CDK1, and low Chk2 were also more frequent in tumors with low nuclear ATM level (Ps < .05). Low ATM protein level was significantly associated with poor survival including in patients with ER-negative tumors who received adjuvant anthracycline or cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil\u2013based adjuvant chemotherapy (Ps < .05). Low nuclear Chk2 protein was likely in ER\u00a0\u2212/PR\u00a0\u2212/AR\u00a0\u2212; HER-2 positive; breast cancer 1, early onset negative; low XRCC1; low SMUG1; low APE1; low pol\u03b2; low DNA-PKcs; low ATM; low Bcl-2; and low TOPO2A tumors (P < .05). In patients with ER\u00a0+ tumors who received endocrine therapy or ER-negative tumors who received chemotherapy, nuclear Chk2 levels did not significantly influence survival. In p53 mutant tumors, low ATM (P < .000001) or high Chk2 (P < .01) was associated with poor survival. When investigated together, low-ATM/high-Chk2 tumors have the worst survival (P = .0033).

     "abstract": "According to established notion, one of the major angiogenesis-inducing factors, pro-matrix metalloproteinase-9 (proMMP-9), is supplied to the tumor microenvironment by tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Accumulated evidence, however, indicates that tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) are also critically important for proMMP-9 delivery, especially at early stages of tumor development. To clarify how much angiogenic proMMP-9 is actually contributed by TAMs and TANs, we quantitatively evaluated TAMs and TANs from different tumor types, including human xenografts and syngeneic murine tumors grown in wild-type and Mmp9-knockout mice. Whereas host MMP-9 competence was required for full angiogenic potential of both normal and tumor-associated leukocytes, direct comparisons of neutrophils versus macrophages and TANs versus TAMs demonstrated that macrophages and TAMs secrete 40- to 50-fold less proMMP-9 than the same numbers of neutrophils or TANs. Correspondingly, the levels of MMP-9\u2013mediated in vivo angiogenesis induced by neutrophils and TANs substantially exceeded those induced by macrophages and TAMs. MMP-9\u2013delivering TANs were also required for development of metastasis-supporting intratumoral vasculature, characterized by \u2265\u00a011-\u03bcm size lumens and partial coverage with stabilizing pericytes. Importantly, MMP-9\u2013producing TAMs exhibit M2-skewed phenotype but do not express tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), a novel characteristic allowing them to secrete TIMP-1\u2013free, neutrophil-like MMP-9 zymogen unencumbered by its natural inhibitor. Together, our findings support the notion whereby TANs, capable of immediate release of their pre-stored cargo, are the major contributors of highly angiogenic MMP-9, whereas tumor-influxing precursors of macrophages require time to differentiate, polarize into M2-skewed TAMs, shut down their TIMP-1 expression, and only then, initiate relatively low-level production of TIMP-free MMP-9 zymogen.",

     "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSC) and genes have been linked to cancer development and therapeutic resistance, but the signaling mechanisms regulating CSC genes and phenotype are incompletely understood. CK2 has emerged as a key signal serine/threonine kinase that modulates diverse signal cascades regulating cell fate and growth. We previously showed that CK2 is often aberrantly expressed and activated in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC), concomitantly with mutant (mt) tumor suppressor TP53, and inactivation of its family member, TAp73. Unexpectedly, we observed that classical stem cell genes Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4, are overexpressed in HNSCC with inactivated TAp73 and mtTP53. However, the potential relationship between CK2, TAp73 inactivation, and CSC phenotype is unknown. We reveal that inhibition of CK2 by pharmacologic inhibitors or siRNA inhibits the expression of CSC genes and side population (SP), while enhancing TAp73 mRNA and protein expression. Conversely, CK2 inhibitor attenuation of CSC protein expression and the SP by was abrogated by TAp73 siRNA. Bioinformatic analysis uncovered a single predicted CK2 threonine phosphorylation site (T27) within the N-terminal transactivation domain of TAp73. Nuclear CK2 and TAp73 interaction, confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation, was attenuated by CK2 inhibitor, or a T27A point-mutation of this predicted CK2 threonine phospho-acceptor site of TAp73. Further, T27A mutation attenuated phosphorylation, while enhancing TAp73 function in repressing CSC gene expression and SP cells. A new CK2 inhibitor, CX-4945, inhibited CSC related SP cells, clonogenic survival, and spheroid formation. Our study unveils a novel regulatory mechanism whereby aberrant CK2 signaling inhibits TAp73 to promote the expression of CSC genes and phenotype.",

ETS factors control the expression of genes involved in many biological processes, such as cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. FLI1 is an ETS protein aberrantly expressed in retrovirus-induced hematological tumors, but limited attention has been directed towards elucidating the role of FLI1 in epithelial-derived cancers. Using data mining, we show that loss of FLI1 expression is associated with shorter survival and more aggressive phenotypes of breast cancer. Gain and loss of function cellular studies indicate the inhibitory effect of FLI1 expression on cellular growth, migration, and invasion. Using Fli1 mutant mice and both a transgenic murine breast cancer model and an orthotopic injection of syngeneic tumor cells indicates that reduced Fli1 contributes to accelerated tumor growth. Global expression analysis and RNA-Seq data from an invasive human breast cancer cell line with over expression of either FLI1 and another ETS gene, PDEF, shows changes in several cellular pathways associated with cancer, such as the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. This study demonstrates a novel role for FLI1 in epithelial cells. In addition, these results reveal that FLI1 down-regulation in breast cancer may promote tumor progression.",

     "abstract": "Defects in telomere maintenance can result in telomere fusions that likely play a causative role in carcinogenesis by promoting genomic instability. However, this proposition remains to be fully understood in human colon carcinogenesis. In the present study, the temporal sequence of telomere dysfunction dynamics was delineated by analyzing telomere fusion, telomere length, telomerase activity, hotspot mutations in KRAS or BRAF, and TP53 of tissue samples obtained from 18 colon cancer patients. Our results revealed that both the deficiency of p53 and the shortening of mean telomere length were not necessary for producing telomere fusions in colon tissue. In five cases, telomere fusion was observed even in tissue adjacent to cancerous lesions, suggesting that genomic instability is initiated in pathologically non-cancerous lesions. The extent of mean telomere attrition increased with lymph node invasiveness of tumors, implying that mean telomere shortening correlates with colon cancer progression. Telomerase activity was relatively higher in most cancer tissues containing mutation(s) in KRAS or BRAF and/or TP53 compared to those without these hotspot mutations, suggesting that telomerase could become fully active at the late stage of colon cancer development. Interestingly, the majority of telomere fusion junctions in colon cancer appeared to be a chromatid-type containing chromosome 7q or 12q. In sum, this meticulous correlative study not only highlights the concept that telomere fusion is present in the early stages of cancer regardless of TP53/KRAS mutation status, mean telomere length, and telomerase activity, but also provides additional insights targeting key telomere fusion junctions which may have significant implications for colon cancer diagnoses.",

It inhibits the activity of protein tyrosine kinases and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis pathway.

A77 1726 increased the phosphorylation of AKT, p70 S6 (S6K1), ERK1/2, and MEK through the feedback activation of the IGF-1 receptor\u2013mediated signaling pathway. Invitro kinase assay revealed that leflunomide and A77 1726 inhibited S6K1 activity with IC50 values of approximately 55 and 80 \u03bcM, respectively. Exogenous uridine partially blocked A77 1726\u2013induced inhibition of A375 cell proliferation. S6K1 knockdown led to the inhibition of A375 cell proliferation but did not potentiate the antiproliferative effect of A77 1726. A77 1726 stimulated bromodeoxyuridine incorporation in A375 cells but arrested the cell cycle in the S phase, which was reversed by addition of exogenous uridine or by MAP kinase pathway inhibitors but not by rapamycin and LY294002 (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor). These observations suggest that A77 1726 accelerates cell cycle entry into the S phase through MAP kinase activation and that pyrimidine nucleotide depletion halts the completion of the cell cycle. Our study identified a novel molecular target of A77 1726 and showed that the inhibition of S6K1 activity was in part responsible for its antiproliferative activity. Our study also provides a novel mechanistic insight into A77 1726\u2013induced cell cycle arrest in the S phase.",

Dbait (which stands for DNA strand break bait) molecules mimic DSBs and trap DNA repair proteins, thereby inhibiting repair of DNA damage induced by radiation therapy (RT). First, the cytotoxic efficacy of Dbait in combination with RT was evaluated in vitro in SK28 and 501mel human melanoma cell lines. Though the extent of RT-induced damage was not increased by Dbait, it persisted for longer revealing a repair defect. Dbait enhanced RT efficacy independently of RT doses. We further assayed the capacity of DT01 (clinical form of Dbait) to enhance efficacy of \u201cpalliative\u201d RT (10 \u00d7 3 Gy) or \u201cradical\u201d RT (20 \u00d7 3 Gy), in an SK28 xenografted model. Inhibition of repair of RT-induced DSB by DT01 was revealed by the significant increase of micronuclei in tumors treated with combined treatment. Mice treated with DT01 and RT combination had significantly better tumor growth control and longer survival compared to RT alone with the \u201cpalliative\u201d protocol [tumor growth delay (TGD) by 5.7-fold; median survival: 119 vs 67\u00a0days] or the \u201cradical\u201d protocol (TGD by 3.2-fold; median survival: 221 vs 109\u00a0days). Only animals that received the combined treatment showed complete responses. No additional toxicity was observed in any DT01-treated groups. This preclinical study provides encouraging results for a combination of a new DNA repair inhibitor, DT01, with RT, in the absence of toxicity.

We have determined the degree of sensitivity/resistance to Selumetinib in a panel of colorectal cancer cell lines using cell proliferation and soft agar assays. Sensitive cell lines underwent G1 arrest, whereas Selumetinib had no effect on the cell cycle of resistant cells. Some of the resistant cell lines showed high levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in the absence of serum. Selumetinib inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and RSK and had no effect on AKT phosphorylation in both sensitive and resistant cells. Furthermore, mutations in KRAS, BRAF, or PIK3CA were not clearly associated with Selumetinib resistance. Surprisingly, Selumetinib was able to inhibit phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) and its downstream target ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6) in sensitive cell lines. However, p70S6K and RPS6 phosphorylation remained unaffected or even increased in resistant cells. Moreover, in some of the resistant cell lines p70S6K and RPS6 were phosphorylated in the absence of serum. Interestingly, colorectal primary cultures derived from tumours excised to patients exhibited the same behaviour than established cell lines. Pharmacological inhibition of p70S6K using the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235, the specific mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin and the specific p70S6K inhibitor PF-4708671 potentiated Selumetinib effects in resistant cells. In addition, biological inhibition of p70S6K using siRNA rendered responsiveness to Selumetinib in resistant cell lines. Furthermore, combination of p70S6K silencing and PF-47086714 was even more effective.

Recently, chromosome 17 centromere enumeration probe (CEP17) duplication has also been associated with increased responsiveness to anthracyclines. However, reports are conflicting and none of these tumor markers can yet be considered a clinically reliable predictor of response to anthracyclines. We studied the association of TOP2A gene alterations, HER2 gene amplification, and CEP17 duplication with response to anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 140 patients with operable or locally advanced breast cancer. HER2 was tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization and TOP2A and CEP17 by chromogenic in situ hybridization. Thirteen patients (9.3%) achieved pathologic complete response (pCR). HER2 amplification was present in 24 (17.5%) of the tumors. TOP2A amplification occurred in seven tumors (5.1%). CEP17 duplication was detected in 13 patients (9.5%). CEP17 duplication correlated with a higher rate of pCR [odds ratio (OR) 6.55, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.25-34.29, P = .026], and analysis of TOP2A amplification showed a trend bordering on statistical significance (OR 6.97, 95% CI 0.96-50.12, P = .054).

This arbitrary distinction has been proposed decades ago, although the biological relationship between AMH and PCC has never been investigated. Both lesions are frequently diagnosed in multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) patients in whom they are considered as two unrelated clinical entities. In this study, we investigated the molecular relationship between AMH and PCC in MEN2 patients. Molecular aberrations of 19 AMHs and 13 PCCs from 18 MEN2 patients were determined by rearranged during transfection (RET) proto-oncogene mutation analysis and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis for chromosomal regions 1p13, 1p36, 3p, and 3q, genomic areas covering commonly altered regions in RET-related PCC. Identical molecular aberrations were found in all AMHs and PCCs, at similar frequencies. LOH was seen for chromosomes 1p13 in 8 of 18 (44%), 1p36 in 9 of 15 (60%), 3p12-13 in 12 of 18 (67%), and 3q23-24 in 10 of 16 (63%) of AMHs, and for chromosome 1p13 in 13 of 13 (100%), 1p36 in 7 of 11 (64%), 3p12-13 in 4 of 11 (36%), and 3q23-24 in 11 of 12 (92%) of PCCs. Our results indicate that AMHs are not hyperplasias and, in clinical practice, should be regarded as PCCs, which has an impact on diagnosis and treatment of MEN2 patients.

Acquired chemoresistance, high systemic toxicity, and low penetration of the blood brain barrier by many anticancer drugs contribute to the failure of anti-GBM therapies. To circumvent some of these obstacles, we tested a novel prodrug approach to evaluate anti-GBM efficacy by utilizing serum albumin-binding doxorubicin (Doxo), aldoxorubicin (Aldoxo), which is less toxic, is released from albumin in an acidic environment and accumulates in tumor tissues. A human GBM cell line that expresses a luciferase reporter (U87-luc) was stereotactically injected into the left striatum of the brain of immunodeficient mice. Following initial tumor growth for 12 days, mice were injected once a week in the tail-vein with Aldoxo [24 mg/kg or 18 mg/kg of doxorubicin equivalents\u20143/4 maximum tolerated dose (MTD)], Doxo [6 mg/kg (3/4 MTD)], or vehicle. Aldoxo-treated mice demonstrated significantly slower growth of the tumor when compared to vehicle-treated or Doxo-treated mice. Five out of eight Aldoxo-treated mice remained alive more than 60 days with a median survival of 62 days, while the median survival of vehicle- and Doxo-treated mice was only 26 days. Importantly, Aldoxo-treated mice exhibited high levels of Doxo within the tumor tissue, accompanied by low tumor cell proliferation (Ki67) and abundant intratumoral programmed cell death (cleaved caspase-3). Effective accumulation of Aldoxo in brain tumor tissues but not normal brain, its anti-tumor efficacy, and low toxicity, provide a strong rationale for evaluating this novel drug conjugate as a treatment for patients afflicted with GBM.",

In this paper, we show that HGV-Apoptin acts independently from the death receptor pathway as it induces apoptosis in similar rates in Jurkat cells deficient in either FADD (fas-associated death domain) function or caspase-8 (key players of the extrinsic pathway) and their parental clones. HGV-Apoptin induces apoptosis via the activation of the mitochondrial intrinsic pathway. It induces both mitochondrial inner and outer membrane permebilization, characterized by the loss of the mitochondrial potential and the release into cytoplasm of the pro-apoptotic molecules including apoptosis inducing factor and cytochrome c. HGV-Apoptin acts via the apoptosome, as lack of expression of apoptotic protease-activating factor 1 in murine embryonic fibroblast strongly protected the cells from HGV-Apoptin\u2013induced apoptosis. Moreover, QVD-oph a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor delayed HGV-Apoptin\u2013induced death. On the other hand, overexpression of the anti-apoptotic BCL-XL confers resistance to HGV-Apoptin\u2013induced cell death. In contrast, cells that lack the expression of the pro-apoptotic BAX and BAK are protected from HGV-Apoptin induced apoptosis.

     "abstract": "Genetic instability has emerged as an important hallmark of human neoplasia. Although most types of cancers exhibit genetic instability to some extent, in colorectal cancers genetic instability is a distinctive characteristic. Recent studies have shown that deregulation of genes involved in sister chromatid cohesion can result in chromosomal instability in colorectal cancers. Here, we show that the replisome factor minichromosome maintenance complex\u2013binding protein (MCMBP), which is directly involved in the dynamics of the minichromosome maintenance complex and contributes to maintaining sister chromatid cohesion, is transcriptionally misregulated in different types of carcinomas. Cellular studies revealed that both MCMBP knockdown and overexpression in different breast and colorectal cell lines is associated with the emergence of a subpopulation of cells with abnormal nuclear morphology that likely arise as a consequence of aberrant cohesion events. Association analysis integrating gene expression data with clinical information revealed that enhanced MCMBP transcript levels correlate with an increased probability of relapse risk in colorectal cancers and different types of carcinomas. Moreover, a detailed study of a cohort of colorectal tumors showed that the MCMBP protein accumulates to high levels in cancer cells, whereas in normal proliferating tissue its abundance is low, indicating that MCMBP could be exploited as a novel diagnostic marker for this type of carcinoma.",

The antioxidant N-acetylcysteine decreased GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage induced by 4HPR, As2O3, and PEITC, implicating oxidative stress in these effects. GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation was associated with up-regulation of antioxidant enzymes, in particular heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and transient elevation of intracellular glutathione (GSH) in cells surviving acute stress, before occurrence of irreversible damage and death. Genetic inactivation of GSK3\u03b2 or transfection with the non-phosphorylatable GSK3\u03b2-S9A mutant inhibited HO-1 induction under redox stress, while tumor cells resistant to 4HPR exhibited increased GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation, HO-1 expression, and GSH levels. The above-listed findings are consistent with a role for sustained GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation in a signaling network activating antioxidant effector mechanisms during oxidoreductive stress.

     "abstract": "The chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) has been identified as a prominent tumor-promoting factor in breast cancer. The major source for CCL2 is in the tumor cells; thus, identifying the mechanisms regulating CCL2 release by these cells may enable the future design of modalities inhibiting CCL2 secretion and consequently reduce tumorigenicity. Using cells deficient in expression of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and short hairpin RNAs reducing heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) expression, we found that intracellular HS and CS (=\u00a0GAGs) partly controlled the trafficking of CCL2 from the Golgi toward secretion. Next, we determined the secretion levels of GFP-CCL2-WT and GFP-CCL2-variants mutated in GAG-binding domains and/or in the 40s loop of CCL2 (45TIVA48). We have identified partial roles for R18+K19, H66, and the 45TIVA48 motif in regulating CCL2 secretion. We have also demonstrated that in the absence of R24 or R18+K19\u00a0+45TIVA48, the secretion of CCL2 by breast tumor cells was almost abolished. Analyses of the intracellular localization of GFP-CCL2-mutants in the Golgi or the endoplasmic reticulum revealed particular intracellular processes in which these CCL2 sequences controlled its intracellular trafficking and secretion. The R24, 45TIVA48 and R18+K19\u00a0+45TIVA48 domains controlled CCL2 secretion also in other cell types. We propose that targeting these chemokine regions may lead to reduced secretion of CCL2 by breast cancer cells (and potentially also by other malignant cells). Such a modality may limit tumor growth and metastasis, presumably without affecting general immune activities (as discussed below).",

We cloned from human placenta and breast cancer cells the novel human immunomodulator named placenta immunosuppressive ferritin (PLIF). PLIF is composed of a ferritin heavy chain\u2013like domain and a novel cytokine-like domain, named C48. Both intact PLIF and C48 inhibit T cell proliferation. Blocking PLIF by specific antibodies in a tolerant breast cancer model in nude mice resulted in tumor cell apoptosis and rejection. This prompted us to study active immune preventive strategies targeting PLIF activity. Currently, we report on the design and synthesis of the novel C24D polypeptide, which inhibits the binding of PLIF to T cells and therefore inhibits the immune suppressive effect of PLIF. The effect of C24D on the generation of anti\u2013breast cancer cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) was studied in vitro in cultures of MCF-7 (HLA-A2+) or T47D (HLA-A2\u2212) breast cancer cells incubated with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy blood donors.

Anti\u2013MCF-7 CTLs were cross-cytotoxic to MDA-MB-231 (HLA-A2+) triple-negative breast cancer but not to T47D. Moreover, C24D treatment in vivo inhibited the growth of MCF-7 tumors engrafted in immune-compromised nude mice transfused with na\u00efve allogeneic human PBMCs. Our results demonstrate that C24D treatment breakdown breast cancer induced tolerance enabling the initiation of effective anti-tumor immune response.",

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using a centralized pyrosequencing RAS assay, we analyzed the tumors of 94 patients, wild-type for KRAS mutations (codons 12 to 13) by Sanger sequencing (SS), treated with panitumumab. RESULTS: By SS analysis, 94 (62%) of 152 patients were wild-type and their objective response rate to panitumumab was 17%. We first optimized the KRAS test, by performing an accurate tissue-dissection step followed by pyrosequencing, a more sensitive method, and found further mutations in 12 (12.8%) cases. Secondly, tumors were subjected to RAS extension analysis (KRAS, exons 3 to 4; NRAS exons 2 to 4) by pyrosequencing that allowed to identify several rare mutations: KRAS codon 61, 5.3%; codon 146, 5.3%; NRAS, 9.5%. Overall, RAS mutation rate was 32.9%. All patients with additional RAS mutations had progressive or stable disease, except 3 patients with mutations at codon 61 of KRAS or NRAS who experienced partial (2 cases) or complete response. By excluding from the analysis 11 cases with mutations at codons 61, no patient was responsive to treatment (P\u00a0=\u00a0.021). RAS wild-type versus RAS mutated cases had a significantly better time to progression (P\u00a0=\u00a0.044), that resulted improved (p\u00a0=\u00a0.004) by excluding codon 61 mutations. CONCLUSION: This study shows that by optimizing the RAS test it is possible to significantly improve the identification of patients who do not gain benefit of panitumumab. Prospective studies are warranted to determine the clinical significance of rare mutations.",

     "abstract": "Undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma is one of the most aggressive human cancers with frequent RAS mutations. How mutations of the RAS gene contribute to undifferentiated thyroid cancer remains largely unknown. Mice harboring a potent dominant negative mutant thyroid hormone receptor \u03b2, TR\u03b2PV (ThrbPV/PV), spontaneously develop well-differentiated follicular thyroid cancer similar to human cancer. We genetically targeted the KrasG12D mutation to thyroid epithelial cells of ThrbPV/PV mice to understand how KrasG12D mutation could induce undifferentiated thyroid cancer in ThrbPV/PVKrasG12D mice. ThrbPV/PVKrasG12D mice exhibited poorer survival due to more aggressive thyroid tumors with capsular invasion, vascular invasion, and distant metastases to the lung occurring at an earlier age and at a higher frequency than ThrbPV/PV mice did. Importantly, ThrbPV/PVKrasG12D mice developed frequent anaplastic foci with complete loss of normal thyroid follicular morphology. Within the anaplastic foci, the thyroid-specific transcription factor paired box gene 8 (PAX8) expression was virtually lost and the loss of PAX8 expression was inversely correlated with elevated MYC expression. Consistently, co-expression of KRASG12D with TR\u03b2PV upregulated MYC levels in rat thyroid pccl3 cells, and MYC acted to enhance the TR\u03b2PV-mediated repression of the Pax8 promoter activity of a distant upstream enhancer, critical for thyroid-specific Pax8 expression. Our findings indicated that synergistic signaling of KRASG12D and TR\u03b2PV led to increased MYC expression. Upregulated MYC contributes to the initiation of undifferentiated thyroid cancer, in part, through enhancing TR\u03b2PV-mediated repression of the Pax8 expression. Thus, MYC might serve as a potential target for therapeutic intervention.",

We previously reported that deletion of glucose regulated protein 94 (GRP94), a major endoplasmic reticulum chaperone, in the bone marrow and liver leads to progenitor/stem cell expansion. Since liver progenitor cell (LPC) proliferation can contribute to liver tumor formation, here we examined the effect of GRP94 deficiency on spontaneous liver tumorigenesis. Utilizing liver-specific Grp94 knockout mice driven by Albumin-Cre (cGrp94f/f), we discovered that while wild-type livers are tumor free up to 24 months, cGrp94f/f livers showed abnormal small nodules at 15 months and developed HCC and ductular reactions (DRs) by 21 months of age, associating with increased liver injury, apoptosis and fibrosis. cGrp94f/f livers were progressively repopulated by GRP94-positive hepatocytes. At 15 months, we observed expansion of LPCs and mild DRs, as well as increase in cell proliferation. In examining the underlying mechanisms for HCC development in cGrp94f/f livers, we detected increase in TGF-\u03b21, activation of SMAD2/3, ERK, and JNK, and cyclin D1 upregulation at the premalignant stage. While epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was not evident, E-cadherin expression was elevated. Correlating with the recurrence of GRP94 positive-hepatocytes, the HCC was found to be GRP94-positive, whereas the expanded LPCs and DRs remained GRP94-negative. Collectively, this study uncovers that GRP94 deficiency in the liver led to injury, LPC expansion, increased proliferation, activation of oncogenic signaling, progressive repopulation of GRP94-positive hepatocytes and HCC development in aged mice.",

When transgenically expressed in hematopoietic cells, mice faithfully recapitulate human disease with serial progression from peripheral blood (PB) cytopenias and increased bone marrow (BM) blasts to acute leukemia. It is well accepted that genomic instability in dysplastic hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPC) drives the evolution of MDS to acute leukemia. Findings here demonstrate that reticulocytes, myeloid and lymphoid PB cells of NHD13 mice, display an increase in the age-associated loss of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked surface proteins versus wild type controls. These data correlate with a progressive increase in the DNA damage response as measured by \u03b3-H2AX activity, accumulating BM blasts as the disease progresses and finally development of acute leukemia. These findings clearly demonstrate a state of progressive genomic instability that increases the likelihood of a \u201csecond hit\u201d or complimentary mutation later in the disease to trigger development of acute leukemia and underscores the mechanistic nature of how the NUP98-HoxD13 transgene induces progression of MDS to acute leukemia.

Co-injection of unlabeled peptide confirmed that tumor uptake was target-specific. PACE4-negative tumors displayed no tracer uptake 15 minutes after injection, while the kidneys, demonstrated high uptake due to rapid renal clearance of the peptide. The present study supports the feasibility of using a 64Cu/NOTA-ML peptide for PACE4-targeted prostate cancer detection and PACE4 status determination by PET imaging but also provides evidence that ML inhibitor\u2013based drugs would readily reach tumor sites under in vivo conditions for pharmacological intervention or targeted radiation therapy.",

Previous analyses in SUM-52 breast cancer cells showed amplification and overexpression of KAT6A, and subsequent RNAi screening identified KAT6A as a potential driving oncogene. KAT6A is a histone acetyltransferase previously identified as a fusion partner with CREB binding protein in acute myeloid leukemia. Knockdown of KAT6A in SUM-52 cells, a luminal breast cancer cell line harboring the amplicon, resulted in reduced growth rate compared to non-silencing controls and profound loss of clonogenic capacity both in mono-layer and in soft agar. The normal cell line MCF10A, however, did not exhibit slower growth with knockdown of KAT6A. SUM-52 cells with KAT6A knockdown formed fewer mammospheres in culture compared to controls, suggesting a possible role for KAT6A in self-renewal. Previous data from our laboratory identified FGFR2 as a driving oncogene in SUM-52 cells. The colony forming efficiency of SUM-52 KAT6A knockdown cells in the presence of FGFR inhibition was significantly reduced compared to cells with KAT6A knockdown only. These data suggest that KAT6A may be a novel oncogene in breast cancers bearing the 8p11-p12 amplicon. While there are other putative oncogenes in the amplicon, the identification of KAT6A as a driving oncogene suggests that chromatin-modifying enzymes are a key class of oncogenes in these cancers, and play an important role in the selection of this amplicon in luminal B breast cancers.",

Although downstream targets of p53 and their biologic functions in cancer cells have been extensively investigated, it is still far from the full understanding. Here, we demonstrate that Late Cornified Envelope Group I (LCE1) genes, which are located in the LCE gene clusters encoding multiple well-conserved stratum-corneum proteins, are novel downstream targets of p53. Exogenous p53 overexpression using an adenoviral vector system significantly enhanced the expression of LCE1 cluster genes. We also observed induction of LCE1 expressions by DNA damage, which was caused by treatment with adriamycin or UV irradiation in a wild-type p53-dependent manner. Concordantly, the induction of LCE1 by DNA damage was significantly attenuated by the knockdown of p53. Among predicted p53-binding sites within the LCE1 gene cluster, we confirmed one site to be a p53-enhancer sequence by reporter assays. Furthermore, we identified LCE1 to interact with protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5). Knockdown of LCE1 by specific small interfering RNAs significantly increased the symmetric dimethylation of histone H3 arginine 8, a substrate of PRMT5, and overexpression of LCE1F remarkably decreased its methylation level. Our data suggest that LCE1 is a novel p53 downstream target that can be directly transactivated by p53 and is likely to have tumor suppressor functions through modulation of the PRMT5 activity.",

How these distinct invasion patterns coordinate tumor growth and influence clinical outcomes remain poorly understood. We have investigated how perivascular growth affects glioma growth patterning and response to antiangiogenic therapy within the highly vascularized brain. Orthotopically implanted rodent and human glioma cells are shown to commonly invade and proliferate within brain perivascular space. This form of brain tumor growth and invasion is also shown to characterize de novo generated endogenous mouse brain tumors, biopsies of primary human glioblastoma (GBM), and peripheral cancer metastasis to the human brain. Perivascularly invading brain tumors become vascularized by normal brain microvessels as individual glioma cells use perivascular space as a conduit for tumor invasion. Agent-based computational modeling recapitulated biological perivascular glioma growth without the need for neoangiogenesis. We tested the requirement for neoangiogenesis in perivascular glioma by treating animals with angiogenesis inhibitors bevacizumab and DC101. These inhibitors induced the expected vessel normalization, yet failed to reduce tumor growth or improve survival of mice bearing orthotopic or endogenous gliomas while exacerbating brain tumor invasion.

While significant growth inhibition was observed in both KRAS mutant xenograft groups receiving trametinib and dual antibody therapy (tumors 366 and 608), tumor regression was observed in the KRAS wild-type xenografts (tumor 738) treated in the same manner. Dual antibody therapy in conjunction with trametinib was equally or more effective at inhibiting tumor growth and with lower apparent toxicity than trametinib plus lapatinib. Together, these studies provide further support for a role for EGFR and HER2 in pancreatic cancer proliferation and underscore the importance of therapeutic intervention in both the KRAS\u2013rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma kinase (RAF)\u2013MEK\u2013ERK and EGFR-HER2 pathways to achieve maximal therapeutic efficacy in patients.",

Several genetic abnormalities have been identified as critical for the development of MM; however, a number of these abnormalities are also found in patients with MGUS, indicating that there are other, as yet unidentified, factors that contribute to the onset of MM disease. In this study, we identify a Samsn1 gene deletion in the 5TGM1/C57BL/KaLwRij murine model of myeloma. In addition, SAMSN1 expression is reduced in the malignant CD138\u00a0+ PCs of patients with MM and this reduced expression correlates to total PC burden. We identify promoter methylation as a potential mechanism through which SAMSN1 expression is modulated in human myeloma cell lines. Notably, re-expression of Samsn1 in the 5TGM1 murine PC line resulted in complete inhibition of MM disease development in vivo and decreased proliferation in stromal cell\u2013PC co-cultures in vitro. This is the first study to identify deletion of a key gene in the C57BL/KaLwRij mice that also displays reduced gene expression in patients with MM and is therefore likely to play an integral role in MM disease development.",

     "abstract": "High microvascular density (MVD) in the primary tumor has been shown to be associated with increased incidence of lymph node metastases and poor clinical outcome. Other investigations have revealed that a large fraction of hypoxic tissue in the primary tumor is associated with metastatic disease and impaired survival. These data are apparently incompatible because tumor hypoxia is primarily a consequence of poor oxygen supply caused by an inadequate vasculature with increased intervessel distances. Here, we provide an explanation of these observations. Human melanoma xenografts were used as preclinical cancer models. Tumors that metastasized to lymph nodes showed higher interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) than those that did not metastasize, and compared with tumors with low IFP, tumors with high IFP showed large hypoxic fractions centrally, high MVD in the periphery, high peritumoral density of lymphatics, and elevated expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and VEGF-C. Significant correlations were found between peripheral MVD and central hypoxia, and lymph node metastasis was associated with high values of both parameters. These findings suggest that the outcome of cancer may be associated with both high MVD and extensive hypoxia in the primary tumor. We propose that proangiogenic factors are upregulated in the tumor center and that the outward interstitial fluid flow caused by the elevated IFP transports these factors to the tumor surface where they evoke hemangiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, and consequently, that the IFP serves as a link between tumor hypoxia, peripheral tumor hemangiogenesis, peritumoral lymphangiogenesis, and lymph node metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fifth most common solid cancer worldwide. Sorafenib, a small multikinase inhibitor, is the only approved therapy for advanced HCC. The clinical benefit of sorafenib is offset by the acquisition of sorafenib resistance. Understanding of the molecular mechanism of STAT3 overexpression in sorafenib resistance is critical if the clinical benefits of this drug are to be improved. In this study, we explored our hypothesis that loss of RFX-1/SHP-1 and further increase of p-STAT3 as a result of sorafenib treatment induces sorafenib resistance as a cytoprotective response effect, thereby, limiting sorafenib sensitivity and efficiency. We found that knockdown of RFX-1 protected HCC cells against sorafenib-induced cell apoptosis and SHP-1 activity was required for the process. SC-2001, a molecule with similar structure to obatoclax, synergistically suppressed tumor growth when used in combination with sorafenib in vitro and overcame sorafenib resistance through up-regulating RFX-1 and SHP-1 resulting in tumor suppression and mediation of dephosphorylation of STAT3. In addition, sustained sorafenib treatment in HCC led to increased p-STAT3 which was a key mediator of sorafenib sensitivity. The combination of SC-2001 and sorafenib strongly inhibited tumor growth in both wild-type and sorafenib-resistant HCC cell bearing xenograft models. These results demonstrate that inactivation of RFX/SHP-1 induced by sustained sorafenib treatment confers sorafenib resistance to HCC through p-STAT3 up-regulation. These effects can be overcome by SC-2001 through RFX-1/SHP-1 dependent p-STAT3 suppression. In conclusion, the use of SC-2001 in combination with sorafenib may constitute a new strategy for HCC therapy.",

We show that over time in culture there is an overall accumulation of methylation alterations, with preferential increased methylation close to transcription start sites (TSSs), islands, and shore regions. Methylation and gene expression alterations did not correlate for the majority of genes, but for the fraction that correlated, gain of methylation close to TSS was associated with decreased gene expression. Interestingly, the pattern of CpG site methylation observed in immortal T-cell cultures was similar to clinical T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) samples classified as CpG island methylator phenotype positive. These sites were highly overrepresented by polycomb target genes and involved in developmental, cell adhesion, and cell signaling processes.

Patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer presenting with increased values of C-reactive protein do not respond to gemcitabine. So far, no studies have evaluated the correlation between chronic pancreatitis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome, and the loss of chemotherapeutic benefit.Pdx-1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D/+;LSL-Trp53R172H/+ mice were assigned into four groups: 1) Sixteen animals received a daily intraperitoneal injection of caerulein from their ninth week of life on. 2) Sixteen mice were additionally given gemcitabine. 3) Twelve animals received gemcitabine only. 4) Saline-treated control group. Furthermore, human Paca44 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells were seeded and cultured in 0.5% FBS containing growth medium plus/minus 1 \u03bcM gemcitabine plus/minus recombinant human interleukin (IL)-6.Induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome and a mild chronic pancreatitis diminished the beneficial effects of gemcitabine upon median overall survival. In median, the monogemcitabine group survived 191 days, whereas the caerulein-mono group survived 114, the control group 121, and the caerulein gemcitabine group 127 days (P < .05). In vitro, the induction of STAT3 phosphorylation by recombinant human IL-6 promoted pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cell survival during gemcitabine treatment.We could demonstrate for the first time that an improvement in median overall survival with gemcitabine is significantly abolished by a persistent mild chronic pancreatitis and a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. In particular, the inflammation biomarkers C-reactive protein, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b1 could indicate the prognostic benefit of gemcitabine chemotherapy and should now be tested in prospective patient-controlled trials.",

Thirty-one NB patients older than 10 years who were included in the Spanish NB Registry were considered for the current study; seven young and middle-aged adult patients (range 18-60 years) formed part of the cohort.

Preadolescent and adolescent NB tumors showed a higher number of SCA, including 17q gain and 11q deletion. There was also a marked infiltration of immune cells, mainly high and heterogeneous, in young and middle-aged adult tumors. ATRX negative expression was present in the tumors. The characteristics of preadolescent, adolescent, young adult, and middle-aged adult NB tumors are different, not only from childhood NB tumors but also from each other.

Although genetic alterations are increasingly reported in AML, the gene mutations have not been comprehensively studied in AML-M0. We aimed to examine a wide spectrum of gene mutations in patients with AML-M0 to determine their clinical relevance. Twenty gene mutations including class I, class II, class III of epigenetic regulators (IDH1, IDH2, TET2, DNMT3A, MLL-PTD, ASXL1, and EZH2), and class IV (tumor suppressor genes) were analyzed in 67 patients with AML-M0. Mutational analysis was performed with polymerase chain reaction\u2013based assays followed by direct sequencing. The most frequent gene mutations from our data were FLT3-ITD/FLT3-TKD (28.4%), followed by mutations in IDH1/IDH2 (28.8%), RUNX1 (23.9%), N-RAS/K-RAS (12.3%), TET2 (8.2%), DNMT3A (8.1%), MLL-PTD (7.8%), and ASXL1 (6.3%). Seventy-nine percent (53/67) of patients had at least one gene mutation. Class I genes (49.3%) were the most common mutated genes, which were mutually exclusive. Class III genes of epigenetic regulators were also frequent (43.9%). In multivariate analysis, old age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.029, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.013-1.044, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001) was the independent adverse factor for overall survival, and RUNX1 mutation (HR 2.326, 95% CI 0.978-5.533, P\u00a0=\u00a0.056) had a trend toward inferior survival. In conclusion, our study showed a high frequency of FLT3, RUNX1, and IDH mutations in AML-M0, suggesting that these mutations played a role in the pathogenesis and served as potential therapeutic targets in this rare and unfavorable subtype of AML.",

The type III TGF-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2RIII) mediates BMP signaling. While T\u03b2RIII expression is lost during breast cancer progression, the role of T\u03b2RIII in regulating BMP signaling in normal mammary epithelium and breast cancer cells has not been examined. Restoring T\u03b2RIII expression in a 4T1 murine syngeneic model of breast cancer suppressed Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and inhibited the expression of the BMP transcriptional targets, Id1 and Smad6, in vivo. Similarly, restoring T\u03b2RIII expression in human breast cancer cell lines or treatment with sT\u03b2RIII inhibited BMP-induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and BMP-stimulated migration and invasion. In normal mammary epithelial cells, shRNA-mediated silencing of T\u03b2RIII, T\u03b2RIII over-expression, or treatment with sT\u03b2RIII inhibited BMP-mediated phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 and BMP induced migration. Inhibition of T\u03b2RIII shedding through treatment with TAPI-2 or expression of a non-shedding T\u03b2RIII mutant rescued T\u03b2RIII mediated inhibition of BMP induced Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation and BMP induced migration and/or invasion in both in normal mammary epithelial cells and breast cancer cells. Conversely, expression of a T\u03b2RIII mutant, which exhibited increased shedding, significantly reduced BMP-mediated Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation, migration, and invasion. These data demonstrate that T\u03b2RIII regulates BMP-mediated signaling and biological effects, primarily through the ligand sequestration effects of sT\u03b2RIII in normal and cancerous mammary epithelial cells and suggest that the ratio of membrane bound versus sT\u03b2RIII plays an important role in mediating these effects.",

Recently, the daily continuous administration of chemotherapy in low doses \u2013 called metronomic chemotherapy (MC) \u2013 has been shown to inhibit primary tumor growth and delay metastases in several tumor types; however, its use as a single therapy is still in question due to its moderate therapeutic benefit. Here, we show that the combination of weekly gemcitabine with MC of the same drug delays tumor regrowth and inhibits metastasis in mice implanted orthotopically with pancreatic tumors. We further demonstrate that weekly gemcitabine, but not continuous MC gemcitabine or the combination of the two drug regimens, promotes rebound myeloid-derived suppressor cell (MDSC) mobilization and increases angiogenesis in this tumor model. Furthermore, Bv8 is highly expressed in MDSCs colonizing pancreatic tumors in mice treated with weekly gemcitabine compared to MC gemcitabine or the combination of the two regimens. Blocking Bv8 with antibodies in weekly gemcitabine-treated mice results in a significant reduction in tumor regrowth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Overall, our results suggest that pro-tumorigenic effects induced by weekly gemcitabine are mediated in part by MDSCs expressing Bv8. Therefore, both Bv8 inhibition and MC can be used as legitimate 'add-on' treatments for preventing post-chemotherapy pancreatic cancer recurrence, progression, and metastasis following weekly gemcitabine therapy.",

High PEDF and MITF expression is characteristic of low aggressive melanomas classified according to molecular and pathological criteria, whereas both factors are decreased in senescent melanocytes and naevi. Importantly, MITF silencing down-regulates PEDF expression in melanoma cell lines and primary melanocytes, suggesting that the correlation in the expression reflects a causal relationship. In agreement, analysis of Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) data sets revealed three MITF binding regions within the first intron of SERPINF1, and reporter assays demonstrated that the binding of MITF to these regions is sufficient to drive transcription. Finally, we demonstrate that exogenous PEDF expression efficiently halts in vitro migration and invasion, as well as in vivo dissemination of melanoma cells induced by MITF silencing.

In this study, we examined the role of ATBF1 in prostatic carcinogenesis by specifically deleting Atbf1 in mouse prostatic epithelial cells. We also examined the effect of Atbf1 deletion on gene expression and signaling pathways in mouse prostates. Histopathologic analyses showed that Atbf1 deficiency caused hyperplasia and mouse prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPIN) primarily in the dorsal prostate but also in other lobes. Hemizygous deletion of Atbf1 also increased the development of hyperplasia and mPIN, indicating a haploinsufficiency of Atbf1. The mPIN lesions expressed luminal cell markers and harbored molecular changes similar to those in human PIN and prostate cancer, including weaker expression of basal cell marker cytokeratin 5 (Ck5), cell adhesion protein E-cadherin, and the smooth muscle layer marker Sma; elevated expression of the oncoproteins phospho-Erk1/2, phospho-Akt and Muc1; and aberrant protein glycosylation. Gene expression profiling revealed a large number of genes that were dysregulated by Atbf1 deletion, particularly those that encode for secretory and cell membrane proteins. The four signaling networks that were most affected by Atbf1 deletion included those centered on Erk1/2 and IGF1, Akt and FSH, NF-\u03baB and progesterone and \u03b2-estradiol. These findings provide in vivo evidence that ATBF1 is a tumor suppressor in the prostate, suggest that loss of Atbf1 contributes to tumorigenesis by dysregulating membrane and secretory proteins and multiple signaling pathways, and provide a new animal model for prostate cancer.",

With the limited availability of pathologically verified clinical specimens, cell line models are routinely used for pathway-centric studies. We measured the metabolome of luminal and basal-like BCa cell lines using mass spectrometry, linked metabolites to biochemical pathways using Gene Set Analysis, and developed a novel rank-based method to select pathways on the basis of their enrichment in patient-derived omics data sets and prognostic relevance. Key mediators of the pathway were then characterized for their role in disease progression. Pyrimidine metabolism was altered in luminal versus basal BCa, whereas the combined expression of its associated genes or expression of one key gene, ribonucleotide reductase subunit M2 (RRM2) alone, associated significantly with decreased survival across all BCa subtypes, as well as in luminal patients resistant to tamoxifen. Increased RRM2 expression in tamoxifen-resistant patients was verified using tissue microarrays, whereas the metabolic products of RRM2 were higher in tamoxifen-resistant cells and in xenograft tumors. Both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of this key enzyme in tamoxifen-resistant cells significantly decreased proliferation, reduced expression of cell cycle genes, and sensitized the cells to tamoxifen treatment.

     "abstract": "The proto-oncogene proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) kinases (PIM-1, PIM-2, and PIM-3) are serine/threonine kinases that are involved in a number of signaling pathways important to cancer cells. PIM kinases act in downstream effector functions as inhibitors of apoptosis and as positive regulators of G1-S phase progression through the cell cycle. PIM kinases are upregulated in multiple cancer indications, including lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and prostate, gastric, and head and neck cancers. Overexpression of one or more PIM family members in patient tumors frequently correlates with poor prognosis. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate PIM expression in low- and high-grade urothelial carcinoma and to assess the role PIM function in disease progression and their potential to serve as molecular targets for therapy. One hundred thirty-seven cases of urothelial carcinoma were included in this study of surgical biopsy and resection specimens. High levels of expression of all three PIM family members were observed in both noninvasive and invasive urothelial carcinomas. The second-generation PIM inhibitor, TP-3654, displays submicromolar activity in pharmacodynamic biomarker modulation, cell proliferation studies, and colony formation assays using the UM-UC-3 bladder cancer cell line. TP-3654 displays favorable human ether-\u00e0-go-go-related gene and cytochrome P450 inhibition profiles compared with the first-generation PIM inhibitor, SGI-1776, and exhibits oral bioavailability. In vivo xenograft studies using a bladder cancer cell line show that PIM kinase inhibition can reduce tumor growth, suggesting that PIM kinase inhibitors may be active in human urothelial carcinomas.",

We have previously demonstrated that Snail1 is required for the maintenance of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), preventing their premature differentiation. Now, we show that Snail1 controls the tumorigenic properties of mesenchymal cells. Increased Snail1 expression provides tumorigenic capabilities to fibroblastic cells; on the contrary, Snail1 depletion decreases tumor growth. Genetic depletion of Snail1 in MSCs that are deficient in p53 tumor suppressor downregulates MSC markers and prevents the capability of these cells to originate sarcomas in immunodeficient SCID mice. Notably, an analysis of human sarcomas shows that, contrarily to epithelial tumors, these neoplasms display high Snail1 expression. This is particularly clear for undifferentiated tumors, which are associated with poor outcome. Together, our results indicate a role for Snail1 in the generation of sarcomas.",

     "abstract": "PDLIM2 is a cytoskeletal and nuclear PDZ-LIM domain protein that regulates the stability of Nuclear Factor kappa-B (NF\u03baB) and other transcription factors, and is required for polarized cell migration. PDLIM2 expression is suppressed by methylation in different cancers, but is strongly expressed in invasive breast cancer cells that have undergone an Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). PDLIM2 is also expressed in non-transformed breast myoepithelial MCF10A cells and here we asked whether it is important for maintaining the polarized, epithelial phenotype of these cells. Suppression of PDLIM2 in MCF10A cells was sufficient to disrupt cell polarization and acini formation with increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis in the luminal space compared to control acini with hollow lumina. Spheroids with suppressed PDLIM2 exhibited increased expression of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion proteins including beta 1 (\u03b21) integrin. Interestingly, levels of the Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1 R) and Receptor of activated protein kinase C 1 (RACK1), which scaffolds IGF-1R to \u03b21 integrin, were also increased, indicating a transformed phenotype. Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) and cofilin phosphorylation, and RhoA Guanosine Triphosphatase (GTPase) activity were all enhanced in these spheroids compared to control acini. Importantly, inhibition of either FAK or Rho Kinase (ROCK) was sufficient to rescue the polarity defect. We conclude that PDLIM2 expression is essential for feedback regulation of the \u03b21-integrin-RhoA signalling axis and integration of cellular microenvironment signals with gene expression to control the polarity of breast epithelial acini structures. This is a mechanism by which PDLIM2 could mediate tumour suppression in breast epithelium.",

We demonstrated that PARPi-FL has appropriate biophysical properties, low toxicity at concentrations used for imaging, high stability in vivo, and accumulates selectively in glioblastomas due to high PARP1 expression.

     "abstract": "Two genes are called synthetic lethal (SL) if their simultaneous mutations lead to cell death, but each individual mutation does not. Targeting SL partners of mutated cancer genes can kill cancer cells specifically, but leave normal cells intact. We present an integrated approach to uncovering SL pairs in colorectal cancer (CRC). Screening verified SL pairs using microarray gene expression data of cancerous and normal tissues, we first identified potential functionally relevant (simultaneously differentially expressed) gene pairs. From the top-ranked pairs, ~\u00a020 genes were chosen for immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining in 171 CRC patients. To find novel SL pairs, all 169 combined pairs from the individual IHC were synergistically correlated to five clinicopathological features, e.g. overall survival. Of the 11 predicted SL pairs, MSH2-POLB and CSNK1E-MYC were consistent with literature, and we validated the top two pairs, CSNK1E-TP53 and CTNNB1-TP53 using RNAi knockdown and small molecule inhibitors of CSNK1E in isogenic HCT-116 and RKO cells. Furthermore, synthetic lethality of CSNK1E and TP53 was verified in mouse model. Importantly, multivariate analysis revealed that CSNK1E-P53, CTNNB1-P53, MSH2-RB1, and BRCA1-WNT5A were independent prognosis markers from stage, with CSNK1E-P53 applicable to early-stage and the remaining three throughout all stages. Our findings suggest that CSNK1E is a promising target for TP53-mutant CRC patients which constitute ~\u00a040% to 50% of patients, while to date safety regarding inhibition of TP53 is controversial. Thus the integrated approach is useful in finding novel SL pairs for cancer therapeutics, and it is readily accessible and applicable to other cancers.",

We have previously shown that intercellular homophilic CEACAM1 interactions protect melanoma cells from lymphocyte-mediated elimination. Here, we study the direct effects of CEACAM1 on melanoma cell biology. By employing tissue microarrays and low-passage primary cultures of metastatic melanoma, we show that CEACAM1 expression gradually increases from nevi to metastatic specimens, with a strong dominance of the CEACAM1-Long tail splice variant. Using experimental systems of CEACAM1 knockdown and overexpression of selective variants or truncation mutants, we prove that only the full-length long tail variant enhances melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. This effect is not reversed with a CEACAM1-blocking antibody, suggesting that it is not mediated by intercellular homophilic interactions. Downstream, CEACAM1-Long increases the expression of Sox-2, which we show to be responsible for the CEACAM1-mediated enhanced proliferation. Furthermore, analysis of the CEACAM1 promoter reveals two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that significantly enhance the promoter's activity compared with the consensus nucleotides. Importantly, case-control genetic SNP analysis of 134 patients with melanoma and matched healthy donors show that patients with melanoma do not exhibit the Hardy-Weinberg balance and that homozygous SNP genotype enhances the hazard ratio to develop melanoma by 35%. These observations shed new mechanistic light on the role of CEACAM1 in melanoma, forming the basis for development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic technologies.",

We identified short stature homeobox 2 (SHOX2) as a miR-375 target, and miR-375\u2013mediated suppression in EMT was reversed by forced SHOX2 expression. Ectopic SHOX2 expression can induce EMT in epithelial-like breast cancer cells, whereas SHOX2 knockdown diminishes EMT traits in mesenchymal-like breast cancer cells, demonstrating SHOX2 as an EMT inducer. We show that SHOX2 acts as a transcription factor to upregulate transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor I (T\u03b2R-I) expression, and T\u03b2R-I inhibitor LY364947 abolishes EMT elicited by ectopic SHOX2 expression, suggesting that transforming growth factor \u03b2 signaling is essential for SHOX2-induced EMT.

However, chronic drug exposure may trigger resistance, limiting the utility of these agents. The metastatic behavior of RCC cells, susceptible (RCCpar) or resistant (RCCres) to the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, was investigated. Adhesion to vascular endothelium or immobilized collagen and fibronectin was quantified. Chemotactic motility was evaluated with a modified Boyden chamber assay. Integrin \u03b1 and \u03b2 subtype receptors were analyzed by flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The physiological relevance of the integrins was then determined by blocking studies and small interfering RNA knockdown. Adhesion to endothelial cells and to fibronectin (not to collagen) and chemotaxis were enhanced in RCCres compared to RCCpar. RCCres detached from fibronectin and motile activity further increased under retreatment with low-dosed temsirolimus. \u03b15 integrin was diminished inside the cell and at the cell surface, whereas the \u03b23 subtype was reduced intracellularly but elevated at the plasma membrane. In RCCpar, blocking \u03b15 surface receptors enhanced RCC-collagen but reduced RCC-fibronectin interaction, whereas the opposite was true for RCCres. Chemotaxis of RCCpar but not of RCCres was strongly diminished by the \u03b15 antibody. Blocking \u03b23 significantly lowered chemotaxis with stronger effects on RCCres, compared to RCCpar. Importantly, \u03b23 knockdown reduced chemotaxis of RCCpar but upregulated the motile behavior of RCCres. Temsirolimus resistance is characterized by quantitative alterations of integrin \u03b15 and \u03b23 expression, coupled to functional changes of the integrin molecules, and forces a switch from RCC adhesion to RCC migration.",

     "abstract": "The Axl receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) has been established as a strong candidate for targeted therapy of cancer. However, the benefits of targeted therapies are limited due to acquired resistance and activation of alternative RTKs. Therefore, we asked if cancer cells are able to overcome targeted Axl therapies. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of Axl by short interfering RNA or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) BMS777607 induces the expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3) and the neuregulin 1(NRG1)\u2013dependent phosphorylation of HER3 in MDA-MB231 and Ovcar8 cells. Moreover, analysis of 20 Axl-expressing cancer cell lines of different tissue origin indicates a low basal phosphorylation of RAC-\u03b1 serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) as a general requirement for HER3 activation on Axl inhibition. Consequently, phosphorylation of AKT arises as an independent biomarker for Axl treatment. Additionally, we introduce phosphorylation of HER3 as an independent pharmacodynamic biomarker for monitoring of anti-Axl therapy response. Inhibition of cell viability by BMS777607 could be rescued by NRG1-dependent activation of HER3, suggesting an escape mechanism by tumor microenvironment. The Axl-TKI MPCD84111 simultaneously blocked Axl and HER2/3 signaling and thereby prohibited HER3 feedback activation. Furthermore, dual inhibition of Axl and HER2/3 using BMS777607 and lapatinib led to a significant inhibition of cell viability in Axl-expressing MDA-MB231 and Ovcar8 cells. Therefore, we conclude that, in patient cohorts with expression of Axl and low basal activity of AKT, a combined inhibition of Axl and HER2/3 kinase would be beneficial to overcome acquired resistance to Axl-targeted therapies.",

Conventional RIT uses \u03b2-emitting radioisotopes, but recently, a growing interest has emerged for the clinical development of \u03b1 particles. \u03b1 emitters are ideal for killing isolated or small clusters of tumor cells, thanks to their specific characteristics (high linear energy transfer and short path in the tissue), and their effect is less dependent on dose rate, tissue oxygenation, or cell cycle status than \u03b3 and X rays. Several studies have been performed to describe \u03b1 emitter radiobiology and cell death mechanisms induced after \u03b1 irradiation. But so far, no investigation has been undertaken to analyze the impact of \u03b1 particles on the immune system, when several studies have shown that external irradiation, using \u03b3 and X rays, can foster an antitumor immune response. Therefore, we decided to evaluate the immunogenicity of murine adenocarcinoma MC-38 after bismuth-213 (213Bi) irradiation using a vaccination approach. In vivo studies performed in immunocompetent C57Bl/6 mice induced a protective antitumor response that is mediated by tumor-specific T cells. The molecular mechanisms potentially involved in the activation of adaptative immunity were also investigated by in vitro studies. We observed that 213Bi-treated MC-38 cells release \u201cdanger signals\u201d and activate dendritic cells. Our results demonstrate that \u03b1 irradiation can stimulate adaptive immunity, elicits an efficient antitumor protection, and therefore is an immunogenic cell death inducer, which provides an attractive complement to its direct cytolytic effect on tumor cells.",

     "abstract": "Prolactin-induced protein (PIP) is expressed in the majority of breast cancers and is used for the diagnostic evaluation of this disease as a characteristic biomarker; however, the molecular mechanisms of PIP function in breast cancer have remained largely unknown. In this study, we carried out a comprehensive investigation of PIP function using PIP silencing in a broad group of breast cancer cell lines, analysis of expression microarray data, proteomic analysis using mass spectrometry, and biomarker studies on breast tumors. We demonstrated that PIP is required for the progression through G1 phase, mitosis, and cytokinesis in luminal A, luminal B, and molecular apocrine breast cancer cells. In addition, PIP expression is associated with a transcriptional signature enriched with cell cycle genes and regulates key genes in this process including cyclin D1, cyclin B1, BUB1, and forkhead box M1 (FOXM1). It is notable that defects in mitotic transition and cytokinesis following PIP silencing are accompanied by an increase in aneuploidy of breast cancer cells. Importantly, we have identified novel PIP-binding partners in breast cancer and shown that PIP binds to \u03b2-tubulin and is necessary for microtubule polymerization. Furthermore, PIP interacts with actin-binding proteins including Arp2/3 and is needed for inside-out activation of integrin-\u03b21 mediated through talin. This study suggests that PIP is required for cell cycle progression in breast cancer and provides a rationale for exploring PIP inhibition as a therapeutic approach in breast cancer that can potentially target microtubule polymerization.",

Oral pH buffers can specifically neutralize the acidic pH of tumors and reduce the incidence of local invasion and metastatic formation in multiple murine models.

B16-F10 (murine melanoma), LL/2 (murine lung) and HCT116 (human colon) tumors are resistant to treatment with lysine buffer therapy, whereas metastasis is potently inhibited by lysine buffers in MDA-MB-231 (human breast) and PC3M (human prostate) tumors. In the current work, we confirmed that sensitive cells utilized a pH-dependent mechanism for successful metastasis supported by a highly glycolytic phenotype that acidifies the local tumor microenvironment resulting in morphological changes. In contrast, buffer-resistant cell lines exhibited a pH-independent metastatic mechanism involving constitutive secretion of matrix degrading proteases without elevated glycolysis. These results have identified two distinct mechanisms of experimental metastasis, one of which is pH-dependent (buffer therapy sensitive cells) and one which is pH-independent (buffer therapy resistant cells).

We report here that NHERF1 controls gland morphogenesis, as demonstrated in three-dimensional (3D) human intestinal glands developing from a single nonpolarized cell. Starting from the early two-cell developmental stage, NHERF1 concentrates at the cellular interface in a central membrane disc that marks the apical pole delimiting the forming lumen. NHERF1 depletion leads to severe disruption of the apical-basal polarity, with formation of enlarged and distorted cell spheroids devoid of a central lumen. This characteristic and the increased number of mitoses in NHERF1-depleted spheroids, including multipolar ones, mimic high-grade dysplasia lesions observed in CRC progression. NHERF1 ERM-binding or PDZ-domain mutants fail to localize apically and impair gland formation most likely by outcompeting endogenous ligands, with the latter mutant completely aborting gland development. Examination of NHERF1 ligands showed that even if both ezrin and moesin colocalized with NHERF1 at the apical membrane, moesin but not ezrin depletion disrupted morphogenesis similarly to NHERF1. NHERF1 depletion resulted also in membrane displacement of PTEN and nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin, events contributing to polarity loss and increased proliferation. These findings reveal an essential role of NHERF1 in epithelial morphogenesis and polarity and validate this 3D system for modeling the molecular changes observed in CRC.",

In glioblastoma (GBM), Sox2 is a marker of cancer stemlike cells (CSCs) in neurosphere cultures and is associated with the proneural molecular subtype. Here, we report that Sox2 expression pattern in GBM tumors and patient-derived mouse xenografts is not restricted to a small percentage of cells and is coexpressed with various lineage markers, suggesting that its expression extends beyond CSCs to encompass more differentiated neoplastic cells across molecular subtypes. Employing a CSC derived from a patient with GBM and isogenic differentiated cell model, we show that Sox2 knockdown in the differentiated state abolished dedifferentiation and acquisition of CSC phenotype. Furthermore, Sox2 deficiency specifically impaired the astrocytic component of a biphasic gliosarcoma xenograft model while allowing the formation of tumors with sarcomatous phenotype. The expression of genes associated with stem cells and malignancy were commonly downregulated in both CSCs and serum-differentiated cells on Sox2 knockdown. Genes previously shown to be associated with pluripontency and CSCs were only affected in the CSC state, whereas embryonic stem cell self-renewal genes and cytokine signaling were downregulated, and the Wnt pathway activated in differentiated Sox2-deficient cells.

The monoclonal antibody cetuximab/Erbitux is frequently applied to treat EGFR-expressing tumors. However, the application of cetuximab alone or in combination with radio- and/or chemotherapy often yields only little benefit for patients. In the present study, we describe a mechanism that explains resistance of both tumor cell lines and cultured primary human glioma cells to cetuximab. Treatment of these cells with cetuximab promoted DNA synthesis in the absence of increased proliferation, suggesting that DNA repair pathways were activated. Indeed, we observed that cetuximab promoted the activation of the DNA damage response pathway and prevented the degradation of essential meiotic endonuclease 1 homolog 1 (Eme1), a heterodimeric endonuclease involved in DNA repair. The increased levels of Eme1 were necessary for enhanced DNA repair, and the knockdown of Eme1 was sufficient to prevent efficient DNA repair in response to ultraviolet-C light or megavoltage irradiation. These treatments reduced the survival of tumor cells, an effect that was reversed by cetuximab application. Again, this protection was dependent on Eme1. Taken together, these results suggest that cetuximab initiates pathways that result in the stabilization of Eme1, thereby resulting in enhanced DNA repair.

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by high constitutive vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) production that induces a specific vascular phenotype. We previously reported that this phenotype may allow shedding of multicellular tumor fragments into the circulation, possibly contributing to the development of metastasis. Disruption of this phenotype through inhibition of VEGF signaling may therefore result in reduced shedding of tumor fragments and improved prognosis. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of neoadjuvant sorafenib treatment on tumor cluster shedding. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with renal cancer (n = 10, of which 8 have ccRCC) received sorafenib for 4 weeks before tumor nephrectomy. The resection specimens were perfused, and the perfundate was examined for the presence of tumor clusters. Effects of the treatment on the tumor morphology and overall survival were investigated (follow-up of 2 years) and compared with a carefully matched control group. RESULTS: Neoadjuvant sorafenib treatment induced extensive ischemic tumor necrosis and, as expected, destroyed the characteristic ccRCC vascular phenotype. In contrast to the expectation, vital groups of tumor cells with high proliferation indices were detected in postsurgical renal venous outflow in 75% of the cases. Overall survival of patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment was reduced compared to a control group, matched with regard to prognostic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that neoadjuvant sorafenib therapy for ccRCC does not prevent shedding of tumor fragments. Although this is a nonrandomized study with a small patient group, our results suggest that neoadjuvant treatment may worsen survival through as yet undefined mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that alcohol consumption is associated with increased risk of a few solid cancers, although studies that examined the association with hematological malignancies have shown inconsistent results. In this study, we examined the risk of hematological malignancies among individuals who had alcohol use disorders (AUDs) in Sweden. METHODS: Individuals with AUDs were identified from the nationwide Swedish Hospital Discharge Register and Outpatient Register, the Crime Register, and the Prescription Drug Register, and they were linked to the Swedish Cancer Registry to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of hematological malignancies, using those Swedes without AUDs as a reference. In addition, we used a quasi-experimental sibling design to investigate the odds ratios among sibling pairs who were discordant with AUDs. RESULTS: A total of 420,489 individuals were identified with AUDs. After more than 15 million person-years of follow-up, a total of 1755 individuals developed hematological malignancies demonstrating a low risk, i.e., SIR = 0.60 (95% confidence interval = 0.57-0.63). People with AUDs had low risks for developing specific types of malignancies. The lowest risk (0.51) was for leukemia, followed by myeloma (0.52), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.65), and Hodgkin disease (0.71). The risk was lower among AUDs identified at an older age. The low risks of hematological malignancies were also noted using sibling analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that alcohol consumption has a protective effect against hematological malignancies. However, further studies are needed to identity the underlying mechanisms of the protective effect of alcohol consumption against hematological malignancies.",

In squamous epithelial skin and cervix lesions, transition to invasive stages is associated with enhanced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, increased angiogenesis, and worsened prognosis. Thus, we investigated MMP activity as imaging biomarker of invasiveness and the potential of optical tomography in characterizing the angiogenic and invasive behavior of skin squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) xenografts. MMP activity was measured in vivo in HaCaT-ras A-5RT3 tumors at different angiogenic and invasive stages (onset of angiogenesis, intermediate and highly angiogenic, invasive stage) and after 1 week of sunitinib treatment by fluorescence molecular tomography\u2013microcomputed tomography imaging using an activatable probe. Treatment response was additionally assessed morphologically by optical coherence tomography (OCT). In vivo MMP activity significantly differed between the groups, revealing highest levels in the highly angiogenic, invasive tumors that were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. At the onset of angiogenesis with lowest MMP activity, fibroblasts were detected in the MMP-positive areas, whereas macrophages were absent. Accumulation of both cell types occurred in both invasive groups, again to a significantly higher degree at the most invasive and angiogenic stage. Sunitinib treatment significantly reduced the MMP activity and accumulation of fibroblasts and macrophages and blocked tumor invasion that was additionally visualized by OCT. Human cervical SCCs also showed high MMP activity and a similar stromal composition as the HaCaT xenografts, whereas normal tissue was negative. This study strongly suggests MMP activity as imaging biomarker and demonstrates the high sensitivity of optical tomography in determining tumor invasiveness that can morphologically be supported by OCT.",

To investigate the oncogenic role of KIF14, we used noncancerous human mammary epithelial cells and ectopically expressed KIF14 and found increased proliferative capacity, increased anchorage-independent grown in vitro, and increased resistance to docetaxel but not to doxorubicin, carboplatin, or gemcitabine. Seventeen benign breast biopsies of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation carriers showed increased KIF14 mRNA expression by fluorescence in situ hybridization compared to controls with no known mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2, suggesting increased KIF14 expression as a biomarker of high-risk breast tissue. Evaluation of 34 cases of locally advanced TNBC showed that KIF14 expression significantly correlates with chemotherapy-resistant breast cancer. KIF14 knockdown also correlates with decreased AKT phosphorylation and activity. Live-cell imaging confirmed an insulin-induced temporal colocalization of KIF14 and AKT at the plasma membrane, suggesting a potential role of KIF14 in promoting activation of AKT. An experimental small-molecule inhibitor of KIF14 was then used to evaluate the potential anticancer benefits of downregulating KIF14 activity. Inhibition of KIF14 shows a chemosensitizing effect and correlates with decreasing activation of AKT. Together, these findings show an early and critical role for KIF14 in the tumorigenic potential of TNBC, and therapeutic targeting of KIF14 is feasible and effective for TNBC.",

     "abstract": "Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the major gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors with a variable malignancy ranging from a curable disorder to highly malignant sarcomas. Metastasis and recurrence are the main causes of death in GIST patients. To further explore the mechanism of metastasis and to more accurately estimate the recurrence risk of GISTs after surgery, the clinical significance and functional role of collagen triple helix repeat containing-1 (CTHRC1) in GIST were investigated. We found that CTHRC1 expression was gradually elevated as the risk grade of NIH classification increased, and was closely correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival in 412 GIST patients. In vitro experiments showed that recombinant CTHRC1 protein promoted the migration and invasion capacities of primary GIST cells. A luciferase reporter assay and pull down assay demonstrated that recombinant CTHRC1 protein activated noncanonical Wnt/PCP-Rho signaling but inhibited canonical Wnt signaling. The pro-motility effect of CTHRC1 on GIST cells was reversed by using a Wnt5a neutralizing antibody and inhibitors of Rac1 or ROCK. Taken together, these data indicate that CTHRC1 may serve as a new predictor of recurrence risk and prognosis in post-operative GIST patients and may play an important role in facilitating GIST progression. Furthermore, CTHRC1 promotes GIST cell migration and invasion by activating Wnt/PCP-Rho signaling, suggesting that the CTHRC1-Wnt/PCP-Rho axis may be a new therapeutic target for interventions against GIST invasion and metastasis.",

The effect is specific for EGFR versus other Hsp90 client proteins [Ahsan et al.: (2013). Destabilization of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) by a peptide that inhibits EGFR binding to heat shock protein 90 and receptor dimerization. J Biol Chem288, 26879\u201326886]. Here, we show that Disruptin decreases the clonogenicity of a variety of EGFR-dependent cancer cells in culture but not of EGFR-independent cancer or noncancerous cells. The selectivity of Disruptin toward EGFR-driven cancer cells is due to the high level of EGF stimulation of EGFR in EGFR-dependent tumor cells relative to normal cells. When administered by intraperitoneal injection into nude mice bearing EGFR-driven human tumor xenografts, Disruptin causes extensive degradation of EGFR in the tumor but not in adjacent host tissue. Disruptin markedly inhibits the growth of EGFR-driven tumors without producing the major toxicities caused by the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin or by cisplatin. These findings provide proof of concept for development of a new Disruptin-like class of antitumor drugs that are directed specifically against EGFR-driven tumors.",

     "abstract": "Attempts to target mutant KRAS have been unsuccessful. Here, we report the identification of Smad ubiquitination regulatory factor 2 (SMURF2) and UBCH5 as a critical E3:E2 complex maintaining KRAS protein stability. Loss of SMURF2 either by small interfering RNA/short hairpin RNA (siRNA/shRNA) or by overexpression of a catalytically inactive mutant causes KRAS degradation, whereas overexpression of wild-type SMURF2 enhances KRAS stability. Importantly, mutant KRAS is more susceptible to SMURF2 loss where protein half-life decreases from >12 hours in control siRNA-treated cells to <3 hours on Smurf2 silencing, whereas only marginal differences were noted for wild-type protein. This loss of mutant KRAS could be rescued by overexpressing a siRNA-resistant wild-type SMURF2. Our data further show that SMURF2 monoubiquitinates UBCH5 at lysine 144 to form an active complex required for efficient degradation of a RAS-family E3, \u03b2-transducing repeat containing protein 1 (\u03b2-TrCP1). Conversely, \u03b2-TrCP1 is accumulated on SMURF2 loss, leading to increased KRAS degradation. Therefore, as expected, \u03b2-TrCP1 knockdown following Smurf2 siRNA treatment rescues mutant KRAS loss. Further, we identify two conserved proline (P) residues in UBCH5 critical for SMURF2 interaction; mutation of either of these P to alanine also destabilizes KRAS. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that Smurf2 silencing reduces the clonogenic survival in vitro and prolongs tumor latency in vivo in cancer cells including mutant KRAS-driven tumors. Taken together, we show that SMURF2:UBCH5 complex is critical in maintaining KRAS protein stability and propose that targeting such complex may be a unique strategy to degrade mutant KRAS to kill cancer cells.",

These include competing mortality from other A-T-associated pathologies, particularly neurodegeneration and interstitial lung disease, allele-specific effects of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene mutations. There is also limited evidence from clinical observations and studies using Atm knockout mice that modifier genes may account for some variation in leukemia/lymphoma susceptibility.

These unique cells, named here cancer stem cells (CSCs), proliferate slowly and might be involved in resistance to conventional chemotherapy. We have shown that CSCs are found in perivascular niches and rely on endothelial cell-secreted factors [particularly interleukin-6 (IL-6)] for their survival and self-renewal in HNSCC. Here, we hypothesized that cisplatin enhances the stem cell fraction in HNSCC. To address this hypothesis, we generated xenograft HNSCC tumors with University of Michigan-squamous cell carcinoma 22B (UM-SCC-22B) cells and observed that cisplatin treatment increased (P = .0013) the fraction of CSCs [i.e., aldehyde dehydrogenase activity high and cluster of differentiation 44 high (ALDHhighCD44high)]. Cisplatin promoted self-renewal and survival of CSCs in vitro, as seen by an increase in the number of orospheres in ultralow attachment plates and induction in B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (Bmi-1) and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 expression. Cisplatin-resistant cells expressed more Bmi-1 than cisplatinsensitive cells. IL-6 potentiated cisplatin-induced orosphere formation generated when primary human HNSCC cells were sorted for ALDHhighCD44high immediately after surgery and plated onto ultralow attachment plates. IL-6-induced signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation (indicative of stemness) was unaffected by treatment with cisplatin in UM-SCC-22B cells, whereas IL-6-induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation (indicative of differentiation processes) was partially inhibited by cisplatin. Notably, cisplatin-induced Bmi-1 was inhibited by interleukin-6 receptor blockade in parental and cisplatin-resistant cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that cisplatin enhances the fraction of CSCs and suggest a mechanism for resistance to cisplatin therapy in head and neck cancer.",

Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling can promote cell survival and is upregulated in solid tumor types, including colorectal cancer (CRC), although these effects are context dependent. The role of PI3K in tumorigenesis combined with their amenability to specific inhibition makes them attractive drug targets. However, we observed that inhibition of PI3K in HCT116, DLD-1, and SW620 CRC cells did not induce apoptotic cell death. Moreover, these cells were relatively resistant to the Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) mimetic ABT-737, which directly targets the Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators. To test the hypothesis that PI3K inhibition lowers the apoptotic threshold without causing apoptosis per se, PI3K inhibitors were combined with ABT-737. PI3K inhibition enhanced ABT-737-induced apoptosis by 2.3- to 4.5-fold and reduced expression levels of MCL-1, the resistance biomarker for ABT-737. PI3K inhibition enhanced ABT-737-induced apoptosis a further 1.4- to 2.4-fold in CRC cells with small interfering RNA-depleted MCL-1, indicative of additional sensitizing mechanisms. The observation that ABT-737-induced apoptosis was unaffected by inhibition of PI3K downstream effectors AKT and mTOR, implicated a novel PI3K-dependant pathway. To elucidate this, an RNA interference (RNAi) screen of potential downstream effectors of PI3K signaling was conducted, which demonstrated that knockdown of the TEC kinase BMX sensitized to ABT-737. This suggests that BMX is an antiapoptotic downstream effector of PI3K, independent of AKT.",

Deletion of Lfng in mice caused altered Notch activation in the prostate, associated with elevated accumulation of Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 intracellular domains, decreased levels of the putative Notch3 intracellular fragment, as well as increased expression of Hes1, Hes5, and Hey2. Loss of Lfng resulted in expansion of the basal layer, increased proliferation of both luminal and basal cells, and ultimately, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. The Lfng-null prostate showed down-regulation of prostatic tumor suppressor gene NKX3.1 and increased androgen receptor expression. Interestingly, expression of LFNG and NKX3.1 were positively correlated in publically available human prostate cancer data sets. Knockdown of LFNG in DU-145 prostate cancer cells led to expansion of CD44+CD24\u2212 and CD49f+CD24\u2212 stem/progenitor-like cell population associated with enhanced prostatosphere-forming capacity.

However, the mechanisms by which CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells recruit to the tumor site have not been well clarified. In the present study, we showed that hypoxia could stimulate the migration of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells through increased production of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) by head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1)- and HIF-2\u03b1-dependent MIF regulated chemotaxis, differentiation, and pro-angiogenic function of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells through binding to CD74/CXCR2, and CD74/CXCR4 complexes, and then activating p38/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/AKT signaling pathways. Knockdown (KD) of HIF-1\u03b1 and HIF-2\u03b1 in HNSCC cells decreased MIF level but failed to inhibit the CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cell migration, because HIF-1\u03b1/2\u03b1 KD enhanced nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity that increased IL-6 secretion. Simultaneously blocking NF-\u03baB and HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1 had better inhibitory effect on CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cell recruitment in the hypoxic zone than individually silencing HIF-1\u03b1/2\u03b1 or NF-\u03baB. In conclusion, the interaction between HIF-\u03b1/MIF and NF-\u03baB/IL-6 axes plays an important role in the hypoxia-induced accumulation of CD11b+Gr-1+ myeloid cells and tumor growth in HNSCC.",

However, it is unclear whether properties of cancer cells, properties of organmicroenvironments, or a combination of both is responsible for this observed organ tropism. We hypothesized that breast cancer cells exhibit distinctive migration/growth patterns in organ microenvironments that mirror common clinical sites of breast cancer metastasis and that receptor-ligand interactions between breast cancer cells and soluble organ-derived factors mediate this behavior. Using an ex vivo model system composed of organ-conditionedmedia (CM), human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231,MDA-MB-468, SUM149, and SUM159) displayed cell line\u2014specific and organ-specific patterns of migration/proliferation that corresponded to their in vivo metastatic behavior. Notably, exposure to lung-CM increased migration of all cell lines and increased proliferation in two of four lines (P < .05). Several cluster of differentiation (CD) 44 ligands including osteopontin (OPN) and L-selectin (SELL) were identified in lung-CM by protein arrays. Immunodepletion of SELL decreased migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas depletion of OPN decreased both migration and proliferation.

     "abstract": "Classic histology still represents the gold standard in tumor tissue analytics. However, two-dimensional analysis of single tissue slides does not provide a representative overview of the inhomogeneous tumor physiology, and a detailed analysis of complex three-dimensional structures is not feasible with this technique. To overcome this problem, we applied multispectral fluorescence ultramicroscopy (UM) to the field of tumor analysis. Optical sectioning of cleared tumor specimen provides the possibility to three-dimensionally acquire relevant tumor parameters on a cellular resolution. To analyze the virtual UM tumor data sets, we created a novel set of algorithms enabling the fully automatic segmentation and quantification of multiple tumor parameters. This new postmortem imaging technique was applied to determine the therapeutic treatment effect of bevacizumab on the vessel architecture of orthotopic KPLA breast cancer xenografts at different time points. A significant reduction of the vessel volume, number of vessel segments, and branching points in the tumor periphery was already detectable 1 day after initiation of treatment. These parameters remained virtually unchanged in the center of the tumor. Furthermore, bevacizumab-induced vessel normalization and reduction in vascular permeability diminished the penetration behavior of trastuzumab-Alexa 750 into tumor tissue. Our results demonstrated that this new imaging method enables the three-dimensional visualization and fully automatic quantification of multiple tumor parameters and drug penetration on a cellular level. Therefore, UM is a valuable tool for cancer research and drug development. It bridges the gap between common macroscopic and microscopic imaging modalities and opens up new three-dimensional (3D) insights in tumor biology.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Recurrent mutations in the Speckle-Type POZ Protein (SPOP) gene occur in up to 15% of prostate cancers. However, the frequency and features of cancers with these mutations across different populations is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate SPOP mutations across diverse cohorts and validate a series of assays employing high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis and Sanger sequencing for mutational analysis of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: 720 prostate cancer samples from six international cohorts spanning Caucasian, African American, and Asian patients, including both prostate-specific antigen-screened and unscreened populations, were screened for their SPOP mutation status. Status of SPOP was correlated to molecular features (ERG rearrangement, PTEN deletion, and CHD1 deletion) as well as clinical and pathologic features. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Overall frequency of SPOP mutations was 8.1% (4.6% to 14.4%), SPOP mutation was inversely associated with ERG rearrangement (P < .01), and SPOP mutant (SPOPmut) cancers had higher rates of CHD1 deletions (P < .01). There were no significant differences in biochemical recurrence in SPOPmut cancers. Limitations of this study include missing mutational data due to sample quality and lack of power to identify a difference in clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: SPOP is mutated in 4.6% to 14.4% of patients with prostate cancer across different ethnic and demographic backgrounds. There was no significant association between SPOP mutations with ethnicity, clinical, or pathologic parameters. Mutual exclusivity of SPOP mutation with ERG rearrangement as well as a high association with CHD1 deletion reinforces SPOP mutation as defining a distinct molecular subclass of prostate cancer.",

     "abstract": "Although numerous factors have been found to modulate hTERT transcription, the mechanism of its repression in certain leukemias remains unknown. We show here that DEK represses hTERT transcription through its enrichment on the hTERT promoter in cells from chronic and acute myeloid leukemias, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but not acute lymphocytic leukemias where hTERT is overexpressed. We isolated DEK from the hTERT promoter incubated with nuclear extracts derived from fresh acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells and from cells expressing Tax, an hTERT repressor encoded by the human T cell leukemia virus type 1. In addition to the recruitment of DEK, the displacement of two potent known hTERT transactivators from the hTERT promoter characterized both AML cells and Tax-expressing cells. Reporter and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays permitted to map the region that supports the repressive effect of DEK on hTERT transcription, which was proportionate to the level of DEK-promoter association but not with the level of DEK expression. Besides hTERT repression, this context of chromatin redistribution of DEK was found to govern about 40% of overall transcriptional modifications, including those of cancer-prone genes. In conclusion, DEK emerges as an hTERT repressor shared by various leukemia subtypes and seems involved in the deregulation of numerous genes associated with leukemogenesis.",

Two tissue microarrays constructed with 220 and 778 CRC tumors were stained with HLA-DR, DQ, and DP antigen-specific monoclonal antibody LGII-612.14, using the immunoperoxidase staining technique. The immunohistochemical staining results were correlated with the clinical course of the disease. The functional role of HLA class II antigens expressed on CRC cells was analyzed by investigating their in vitro interactions with immune cells. HLA class II antigens were expressed in about 25% of the 220 and 21% of the 778 tumors analyzed with an overall frequency of 23%. HLA class II antigens were detected in 19% of colorectal adenomas. Importantly, the percentage of stained cells and the staining intensity were significantly lower than those detected in CRC tumors. However, HLA class II antigen staining was weakly detected only in 5.4% of 37 normal mucosa tissues. HLA class II antigen expression was associated with a favorable clinical course of the disease. In vitro stimulation with interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) induced HLA class II antigen expression on two of the four CRC cell lines tested. HLA class II antigen expression on CRC cells triggered interleukin-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1) production by resting monocytes. HLA class II antigen expression in CRC tumors is a favorable prognostic marker. This association may reflect stimulation of IL-1\u03b1 production by monocytes.",

We hypothesized that GDC-0980, a dual PI3K-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, would induce an efficient antitumor effect in BRCA-competent triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model when combined with ABT888 and carboplatin. Mechanism-based in vitro studies demonstrated that GDC-0980 treatment alone or in combination led to DNA damage (increased p\u03b3H2AXS139; Western blot, immunofluorescence), gain in poly ADP-ribose (PAR), and a subsequent sensitization of BRCA-competent TNBC cells to ABT888 plus carboplatin with a time-dependent 1) decrease in proliferation signals (pAKTT308/S473, pP70S6KT421/S424, pS6RPS235/236), PAR/poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) ratios, PAR/p\u03b3H2AX ratios, live/dead cell ratios, cell cycle progression, and three-dimensional clonogenic growths and 2) increase in apoptosis markers (cleaved caspases 3 and 9, a pro-apoptotic BH3-only of Bcl-2 family (BIM), cleaved PARP, annexin V). The combination was effective in vitro in BRCA-wild-type PIK3CA-H1047R-mutated BT20 and PTEN-null HCC70 cells. The combination blocked the growth of established xenograft tumors by 80% to 90% with a concomitant decrease in tumor Ki67, CD31, phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, pS6RPS235/236, and p4EBP1T37/46 as well as an increase in cleaved caspase 3 immunohistochemistry (IHC) levels. Interestingly, a combination with GDC-0941, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, failed to block the tumor growth in MDA-MB231. Results demonstrate that the dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR regulates DDR. In a BRCA-competent model, GDC-0980 enhanced the antitumor activity of ABT888 plus carboplatin by inhibiting both tumor cell proliferation and tumor-induced angiogenesis along with an increase in the tumor cell apoptosis.

     "abstract": "Though long-term administration of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) imposed the risk of gastrointestinal track tumorigenesis by accompanied hypergastrinemia, no overt increases of colon cancer risk were witnessed after a long-term cohort study. Our recent investigation revealed that PPI prevented colitis-associated carcinogenesis through antiinflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-mutagenic mechanisms in spite of hypergastrinemia. Therefore, we hypothesized that PPI might either antagonize the trophic action of gastrin on gastrointestinal tumorigenesis or synergize to exert augmented anti-tumorigenic actions.We challenged APCMin/+ mice with gastrin, PPI, PPI and gastrin together for 10 weeks and counted intestinal polyposis accompanied with molecular changes. Gastrin significantly increased intestinal polyposis, but combination of PPI and gastrin markedly attenuated intestinal polyposis compared to gastrinpromoted APCMin/+ mice (P < .001), in which significant \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation and inhibition of \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation were observed with PPI alone or combination of PPI and gastrin, whereas gastrin treatment significantly increased \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation. Significant footprints of apoptosis, G0/G1 accumulation, inactivation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, decreased expressions of CD31, and inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and cyclooxygenase-2 were noted in the combination group. In vitro investigations were similar to in vivo findings as shown that PPI treatment inhibited the binding of gastrin to its receptor, inactivated \u03b2-catenin-associated signaling including Tcf/Lef and glycogen synthase kinase \u03b2, and paradoxically inhibited \u03b2-catenin-associated proliferative activities. Our investigations explain why colon cancer risk has not increased despite long-term use of PPIs and provide a rationale for using PPI to achieve anti-tumorigenesis beyond acid suppression.",

     "abstract": "Metronomic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide (CPA) is widely associated with antiangiogenesis; however, recent studies implicate other immune-based mechanisms, including antitumor innate immunity, which can induce major tumor regression in implanted brain tumor models. This study demonstrates the critical importance of drug schedule: CPA induced a potent antitumor innate immune response and tumor regression when administered intermittently on a 6-day repeating metronomic schedule but not with the same total exposure to activated CPA administered on an every 3-day schedule or using a daily oral regimen that serves as the basis for many clinical trials of metronomic chemotherapy. Notably, the more frequent metronomic CPA schedules abrogated the antitumor innate immune and therapeutic responses. Further, the innate immune response and antitumor activity both displayed an unusually steep dose-response curve and were not accompanied by antiangiogenesis. The strong recruitment of innate immune cells by the 6-day repeating CPA schedule was not sustained, and tumor regression was abolished, by a moderate (25%) reduction in CPA dose. Moreover, an ~20% increase in CPA dose eliminated the partial tumor regression and weak innate immune cell recruitment seen in a subset of the every 6-day treated tumors. Thus, metronomic drug treatment must be at a sufficiently high dose but also sufficiently well spaced in time to induce strong sustained antitumor immune cell recruitment. Many current clinical metronomic chemotherapeutic protocols employ oral daily low-dose schedules that do not meet these requirements, suggesting that they may benefit from optimization designed to maximize antitumor immune responses.",

Here, we demonstrate that for one patient, with the first reported fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) fusion transcript in ovarian cancer, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a more sensitive and specific biomarker than CA125, and it can also inform on a candidate therapeutic. For a 4-year period, during which the patient underwent primary debulking surgery and chemotherapy, tumor recurrences, and multiple chemotherapeutic regimens, blood samples were longitudinally collected and stored. Whereas postsurgical CA125 levels were elevated only three times for 28 measurements, the FGFR2 fusion ctDNA biomarker was readily detectable by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all of these same blood samples and in the tumor recurrences. Given the persistence of the FGFR2 fusion, we treated tumor cells derived from this patient and others with the FGFR2 inhibitor BGJ398. Only tumor cells derived from this patient were sensitive to FGFR2 inhibitor treatment. Using the same methodologic approach, we demonstrate in a second patient with a different fusion that PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis can also be used to identify tumor-specific DNA in the circulation. Taken together, we demonstrate that a relatively inexpensive, PCR-based ctDNA surveillance assay can outperform CA125 in identifying occult disease.",

Alternatively, nicotinic acid (NA) is metabolized to NAD through the nicotinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase domain containing 1 (NAPRT1)-dependent salvage pathway. Tumor cells are more reliant on the NAMPT salvage pathway making this enzyme an attractive therapeutic target. Moreover, the therapeutic index of NAMPT inhibitors may be increased by in NAPRT-deficient tumors by NA supplementation as normal tissues may regenerate NAD through NAPRT1. To confirm the latter, we tested novel NAMPT inhibitors, GNE-617 and GNE-618, in cell culture- and patient-derived tumor models. While NA did not protect NAPRT1-deficient tumor cell lines from NAMPT inhibition in vitro, it rescued efficacy of GNE-617 and GNE-618 in cell culture- and patient-derived tumor xenografts in vivo. NA co-treatment increased NAD and NAM levels in NAPRT1-deficient tumors to levels that sustained growth in vivo. Furthermore, NAM co-administration with GNE-617 led to increased tumor NAD levels and rescued in vivo efficacy as well. Importantly, tumor xenografts remained NAPRT1-deficient in the presence of NA, indicating that the NAPRT1-dependent pathway is not reactivated. Protection of NAPRT1-deficient tumors in vivo may be due to increased circulating levels of metabolites generated by mouse liver, in response to NA or through competitive reactivation of NAMPT by NAM. Our results have important implications for the development of NAMPT inhibitors when considering NA co-treatment as a rescue strategy.",

We show that continuous stimulation of nontransformed breast epithelial cells by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 for 2 to 3 weeks induced their spreading and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The mechanistic bases for this slow induction of EMT by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 are: 1) it took 2 to 3 weeks for the cytokines to induce the expression of the EMT activators Zeb1 and Snail; 2) although Twist has amplified the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail, its expression was reduced by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2; however, the lack of Twist was compensated by prolonged stimulation with TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 that has potentiated the EMT-inducing activities of Zeb1 + Snail. Stimulation by TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 has induced the following dissemination-related properties in the nontransformed cells: 1) up-regulation of functional matrix metalloproteinases; 2) induction of migratory and invasive capabilities; 3) disruption of the normal phenotype of organized three-dimensional acini structures typically formed only by nontransformed breast cells and spreading of nontransformed cells out of such acini. Our findings suggest that TNF\u03b1 + IL-1\u03b2 induce dissemination of nontransformed breast epithelial cells and their reseeding at the primary tumor site; if, then, such detached cells are exposed to transforming events, they may form secondary malignant focus and lead to disease recurrence.

In this study, we investigated [11C]-erlotinib positron emission tomography (PET) imaging as a tool to identify activating mutations of EGFR in both glioma and NSCLC xenografts. Radiotracer specific binding was determined for high and low specific activity (SA) [11C]-erlotinib PET scans in mice bearing synchronous human cancer xenografts with different EGFR expression profiles (PC9, HCC827, U87, U87 \u0394EGFR, and SW620). Although xenograft immunohistochemistry demonstrated constitutive EGFR phosphorylation, PET scan analysis using the Simplified Reference Tissue Model showed that only kinase domain mutant NSCLC (HCC827 and PC9) had significantly greater binding potentials in high versus low SA scans. Xenografts with undetectable EGFR expression (SW620), possessing wild-type EGFR (U87), and expressing an activating extracellular domain mutation (U87 \u0394EGFR) were indistinguishable under both high and low SA scan conditions.

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is characterized by a high degree of resistance to chemotherapy. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition using the small-molecule inhibitor erlotinib was shown to provide a small survival benefit in a subgroup of patients. To identify kinases whose inhibition acts synergistically with erlotinib, we employed a kinome-wide small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-based loss-of-function screen in the presence of erlotinib. Of 779 tested kinases, we identified several targets whose inhibition acted synergistically lethal with EGFR inhibition by erlotinib, among them the S6 kinase ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 (RPS6KA2)/ribosomal S6 kinase 3. Activated RPS6KA2 was expressed in approximately 40% of 123 human pancreatic cancer tissues. RPS6KA2 was shown to act downstream of EGFR/RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) signaling and was activated by EGF independently of the presence of KRAS mutations. Knockdown of RPS6KA2 by siRNA led to increased apoptosis only in the presence of erlotinib, whereas RPS6KA2 activation or overexpression rescued from erlotinib- and gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. This effect was at least in part mediated by downstream activation of ribosomal protein S6. Genetic as well as pharmacological inhibition of RPS6KA2 by the inhibitor BI-D1870 acted synergistically with erlotinib. By applying this synergistic lethality screen using a kinome-wide RNA interference-library approach, we identified RPS6KA2 as potential drug target whose inhibition synergistically enhanced the effect of erlotinib on tumor cell survival. This kinase therefore represents a promising drug candidate suitable for the development of novel inhibitors for pancreatic cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Amplification of the MYCN proto-oncogene is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with metastatic neuroblastoma (NB). MYCN encodes the N-Myc protein, a transcriptional regulator that dimerizes with the Max transcription factor, binds to E-box DNA sequences, and regulates genes involved in cell growth and apoptosis. Overexpression of N-Myc leads to transcriptional activation and an increase in NB cell proliferation. Mxi1, a member of the Myc family of transcriptional regulators, also binds to Max. However, Mxi1 is a transcriptional repressor and inhibits proliferation of NB cells, suggesting that Mxi1 functions as an N-Myc antagonist. Our laboratory previously identified Mxi1-0, an alternatively transcribed Mxi1 isoform. Mxi1-0 has properties distinct from those of Mxi1; in contrast to Mxi1, Mxi1-0 is unable to suppress c-Myc-dependent transcription. We now show that Mxi1-0 expression increases in response to MYCN overexpression in NB cells, with a positive correlation between MYCN and MXI1-0 RNA levels. We also show that N-Myc expression differentially regulates the MXI1 and MXI1-0 promoters: Increased MYCN expression suppresses MXI1 promoter activity while enhancing transcription through the MXI1-0 promoter. Finally, induction of Mxi1-0 leads to increased proliferation, whereas expression of Mxi1 inhibits cell growth, indicating differential roles for these two proteins. These data suggest that N-Myc differentially regulates the expression of MXI1 and MXI1-0 and can alter the balance between the two transcription factors. Furthermore, MXI1-0 appears to be a downstream target of MYCN-dependent signaling pathways and may contribute to N-Myc-dependent cell growth and proliferation.",

Intratumor clonal heterogeneity has been proposed as a major attribute underlying tumor evolution, progression, and resistance to chemotherapy and radiation.

To characterize the degree of intratumor genetic heterogeneity within a single tumor, we performed whole-genome sequencing on three separate regions of an human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and two separate regions from one corresponding cervical lymph node metastasis. This approach achieved coverage of approximately 97.9% of the genome across all samples. In total, 5701 somatic point mutations (SPMs) and 4347 small somatic insertions and deletions (indels)were detected in at least one sample. Ninety-two percent of SPMs and 77% of indels were validated in a second set of samples adjacent to the discovery set. All five tumor samples shared 41% of SPMs, 57% of the 1805 genes with SPMs, and 34 of 55 cancer genes. The distribution of SPMs allowed phylogenetic reconstruction of this tumor's evolutionary pathway and showed that the metastatic samples arose as a late event. The degree of intratumor heterogeneity showed that a single biopsy may not represent the entire mutational landscape of HNSCC tumors. This approach may be used to further characterize intratumor heterogeneity in more patients, and their sample-to-sample variations could reveal the evolutionary process of cancer cells, facilitate our understanding of tumorigenesis, and enable the development of novel targeted therapies.",

     "abstract": "Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, has emerged as a promising molecular target in the prevention of breast cancer. Clinical trials using the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved, AMPK-activating, antidiabetic drug metformin are promising in this regard, but the question of why metformin is protective for some women but not others still remains. Breast cancer associated gene 2 (BCA2/Rabring7/RNF115), a novel Really Interesting New Gene (RING) finger ubiquitin E3 ligase, is overexpressed in >50% of breast tumors. Herein, we report that BCA2 is an endogenous inhibitor of AMPK activation in breast cancer cells and that BCA2 inhibition increases the efficacy of metformin. BCA2 overexpression inhibited both basal and inducible Thr172 phosphorylation/activation of AMPK\u03b11, while BCA2-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) enhanced phosphorylated AMPK\u03b11 (pAMPK\u03b11). The AMPK-suppressive function of BCA2 requires its E3 ligase-specific RING domain, suggesting that BCA2 targets some protein controlling (de)phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b11 for degradation. Activation of AMPK by metformin triggered a growth inhibitory signal but also increased BCA2 protein levels, which correlated with AKT activation and could be curbed by an AMPK inhibitor, suggesting a potential feedback mechanism from pAMPK\u03b11 to pAkt to BCA2. Finally, BCA2 siRNA, or inhibition of its upstream stabilizing kinase AKT, increased the growth inhibitory effect of metformin in multiple breast cancer cell lines, supporting the conclusion that BCA2 weakens metformin's efficacy. Our data suggest that metformin in combination with a BCA2 inhibitor may be a more effective breast cancer treatment strategy than metformin alone.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of PDGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitor (nilotinib) and mTOR inhibitor (everolimus) on tumor stroma in an orthotopic nude mice model of human gastric cancer. Expression of PDGF-B and PDGF-R\u03b2 mRNAs was associated with stromal volume. Treatment with nilotinib did not suppress tumor growth but significantly decreased stromal reactivity, lymphatic invasion, lymphatic vessel area, and pericyte coverage of tumor microvessels. In contrast, treatment with everolimus decreased tumor growth and microvessel density but not stromal reactivity. Nilotinib and everolimus in combination reduced both the growth rate and stromal reaction.

Emerging evidence suggest that A2bR is implicated in tumor progression in some murine tumor models, but the therapeutic potential of targeting A2bR in melanoma has not been examined. This study first shows that melanoma-bearing mice treated with Bay 60-6583, a selective A2bR agonist, had increased melanoma growth. This effect was associated with higher levels of immune regulatory mediators interleukin-10 (IL-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and accumulation of tumor-associated CD11b positive Gr1 positive cells (CD11b+Gr1+) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Depletion of CD11b+Gr1+ cells completely reversed the protumor activity of Bay 60-6583. Conversely, pharmacological blockade of A2bR with PSB1115 reversed immune suppression in the tumor microenvironment, leading to a significant melanoma growth delay. PSB1115 treatment reduced both levels of IL-10 and MCP-1 and CD11b+Gr1+ cell number in melanoma lesions. These effects were associated with higher frequency of tumor-infiltrating CD8 positive (CD8+) T cells and natural killer T (NKT) cells and increased levels of T helper 1 (Th1)-like cytokines. Adoptive transfer of CD11b+Gr1+ cells abrogated the antitumor activity of PSB1115. These data suggest that the antitumor activity of PSB1115 relies on its ability to lower accumulation of tumor-infiltrating MDSCs and restore an efficient antitumor T cell response. The antitumor effect of PSB1115 was not observed in melanoma-bearing nude mice. Furthermore, PSB1115 enhanced the antitumor efficacy of dacarbazine. These data indicate that A2bR antagonists such as PSB1115 should be investigated as adjuvants in the treatment of melanoma.",

Three-dimensional (3D) colorectal gland formation is regulated by phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) coupling of cell division cycle 42 (cdc42) to atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). This study investigated PTEN phosphatase-dependent and phosphatase-independent morphogenic functions in 3D models and assessed translational relevance in human studies. Isogenic PTEN-expressing or PTEN-deficient 3D colorectal cultures were used. In translational studies, apical aPKC activity readout was assessed against apical membrane (AM) orientation and gland morphology in 3D models and human CRC. We found that catalytically active or inactive PTEN constructs containing an intact C2 domain enhanced cdc42 activity, whereas mutants of the C2 domain calcium binding region 3 membrane-binding loop (M-CBR3) were ineffective. The isolated PTEN C2 domain (C2) accumulated in membrane fractions, but C2 M-CBR3 remained in cytosol. Transfection of C2 but not C2 M-CBR3 rescued defective AM orientation and 3D morphogenesis of PTEN-deficient Caco-2 cultures. The signal intensity of apical phospho-aPKC correlated with that of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1 (NHERF-1) in the 3D model. Apical NHERF-1 intensity thus provided readout of apical aPKC activity and associated with glandular morphology in the model system and human colon. Low apical NHERF-1 intensity in CRC associated with disruption of glandular architecture, high cancer grade, and metastatic dissemination. We conclude that the membrane-binding function of the catalytically inert PTEN C2 domain influences cdc42/aPKC-dependent AM dynamics and gland formation in a highly relevant 3D CRC morphogenesis model system.",

Using next-generation whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) as a discovery tool, we analyzed fusion transcripts, gene expression profile, and somatic mutations in frozen tissue of one TFE3 tRCC. By applying a computational analysis developed to call chimeric RNA molecules from paired-end RNA-Seq data, we confirmed the known TFE3 translocation.

In addition, an RNAread-through chimera between TMED6 and COG8 as well as MET and KDR (VEGFR2) point mutations were identified. An EGFR mutation, but no chromosomal rearrangements, was identified in a control group of five clear cell RCCs (ccRCCs). The TFE3 tRCC could be clearly distinguished from the ccRCCs by RNA-Seq gene expression measurements using a previously reported tRCC gene signature. In validation experiments using reverse transcription-PCR, TMED6-COG8 chimera expression was significantly higher in nine TFE3 translocated and six TFE3-expressing/non-translocated RCCs than in 24 ccRCCs (P<.001) and 22 papillaryRCCs (P<.05-.07). Immunohistochemical analysis of selected genes from the tRCC gene signature showed significantly higher eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 2 (EEF1A2) and Contactin 3 (CNTN3) expression in 16 TFE3 translocated and six TFE3-expressing/non-translocated RCCs than in over 200 ccRCCs (P < .0001, both).",

Current techniques are often complicated by tumor heterogeneity. Herein, a novel in vivo approach that combines 19F magnetic resonance imaging (19F-MRI)R1 mapping with diffusionbased multispectral (MS) analysis is introduced. This approach restricts the partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) measurements to viable tumor, the tissue of therapeutic interest. The technique exhibited sufficient sensitivity to detect a breathing gas challenge in a xenograft tumor model, and the hypoxic region measured by MS 19F-MRI was strongly correlated with histologic estimates of hypoxia. This approach was then applied to address the effects of antivascular agents on tumor oxygenation, which is a research question that is still under debate. The technique was used to monitor longitudinal pO2 changes in response to an antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor (B20.4.1.1) and a selective dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (GDC-0980). GDC-0980 reduced viable tumor pO2 during a 3-day treatment period, and a significant reduction was also produced by B20.4.1.1. Overall, this method provides an unprecedented view of viable tumor pO2 and contributes to a greater understanding of the effects of antivascular therapies on the tumor's microenvironment.",

We previously reported that EZH2 was overexpressed in various types of cancer and plays a crucial role in the cell cycle regulation of cancer cells. In the present study, we demonstrated that EZH2 has the function to monomethylate lysine 120 on histone H2B (H2BK120). EZH2-dependent H2BK120 methylation in cancer cells was confirmed with an H2BK120 methylation-specific antibody. Overexpression of EZH2 significantly attenuated the ubiquitination of H2BK120, a key posttranslational modification of histones for transcriptional regulation. Concordantly, knockdown of EZH2 increased the ubiquitination level of H2BK120, suggesting that the methylation of H2BK120 by EZH2 may competitively inhibit the ubiquitination of H2BK120. Subsequent chromatin immunoprecipitation- Seq and microarray analyses identified downstream candidate genes regulated by EZH2 through the methylation of H2BK120. This is the first report to describe a novel substrate of EZH2, H2BK120, unveiling a new aspect of EZH2 functions in human carcinogenesis.",

In this study, we investigated the inhibitory role of ER\u03b25 in BCa cells. Although ER\u03b25 does not reduce proliferation of BCa cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, its ectopic expression significantly decreases their survival by sensitizing them to doxorubicin- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Moreover, we discovered Bcl2L12, which belongs to the Bcl-2 family regulating apoptosis, to be a specific interacting partner of ER\u03b25, but not ER\u03b21 or ER\u03b1, in an estradiol-independent manner. Knockdown of Bcl2L12 enhanced doxorubicin- or cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and this process was further promoted by ectopic expression of ER\u03b25. Whereas Bcl2L12 was previously shown to inhibit apoptosis through binding to caspase 7, such interaction is reduced in the presence of ER\u03b25, suggesting a mechanism by which ER\u03b25 sensitizes cells to apoptosis. In conclusion, ER\u03b25 interacts with Bcl2L12 and functions in a novel estrogen-independent molecular pathway that promotes chemotherapeutic agent-induced in vitro apoptosis of BCa cell lines.",

Here, we show that cyclin G2 plays pivotal roles in the cytoskeletal dynamics in hypoxia-driven invasion by glioblastoma cells. Cyclin G2 is a hypoxia-induced and cytoskeleton-associated protein and is required for glioblastoma expansion. Mechanistically, cyclin G2 recruits cortactin to the juxtamembrane through its SH3 domain-binding motif and consequently promotes the restricted tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in concert with src. Moreover, cyclin G2 interacts with filamentous actin to facilitate the formation of membrane ruffles. In primary glioblastoma, cyclin G2 is abundantly expressed in severely hypoxic regions such as pseudopalisades, which consist of actively migrating glioma cells. Furthermore, we show the effectiveness of dasatinib against hypoxia-driven, cyclin G2-involved invasion in vitro and in vivo. Our findings elucidate the mechanism of cytoskeletal regulation by which severe hypoxia promotes the local invasion and may provide a therapeutic target in glioblastoma.",

We found that miR-205 was downregulated in 33 clinical HCC tissues in comparison with adjacent noncancerous hepatic tissues. The expression levels of miR-205 were inversely correlated with those of HBx in abovementioned tissues. Then, we demonstrated that HBx was able to suppress miR-205 expression in hepatoma and liver cells. We validated that miR-205 directly targeted HBx mRNA. Ectopic expression of miR-205 downregulated HBx, whereas depletion of endogenousmiR-205 upregulated HBx in hepatoma cells. Notably, our data revealed that HBx downregulated miR-205 through inducing hypermethylation of miR-205 promoter in the cells. In terms of function, the forced miR-205 expression remarkably inhibited the HBx-enhanced proliferation of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that miR-205 is a potential tumor-suppressive gene in HCC. HBx-transgenic mice showed that miR-205 was downregulated in the liver. Importantly, HBx was able to abrogate the effect of miR-205 on tumor suppression in carcinogenesis. Therefore, we conclude that HBx is able to inhibit tumor suppressor miR-205 to enhance hepatocarcinogenesis through inducing hypermethylation of miR-205 promoter during their interaction.

Hitherto, the mechanisms triggering these second hits remain largely elusive. Thus, we generated a novel ETV6/RUNX1 transgenic mouse model where the expression of the fusion protein is restricted to CD19+ B cells. These animals harbor regular B cell development and lack gross abnormalities. We established stable pro-B cell lines carrying the ETV6/RUNX1 transgene that allowed us to investigate whether ETV6/RUNX1 itself favors the acquisition of second hits. Remarkably, these pro-B cell lines as well as primary bone marrow cells derived from ETV6/RUNX1 transgenic animals display elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as tested with ETV6/RUNX1 transgenic dihydroethidium staining. In line, intracellular phospho-histone H2AX flow cytometry and comet assay revealed increased DNA damage indicating that ETV6/RUNX1 expression enhances ROS. On the basis of our data, we propose the following model: the expression of ETV6/RUNX1 creates a preleukemic clone and leads to increased ROS levels. These elevated ROS favor the accumulation of secondary hits by increasing genetic instability and doublestrand breaks, thus allowing preleukemic clones to develop into fully transformed leukemic cells.",

     "abstract": "Human tumors using the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) exert high rates of telomere dysfunction. Numerical chromosomal aberrations are very frequent, and structural rearrangements are widely scattered among the genome. This challenging context allows the study of telomere dysfunction-driven chromosomal instability in neoplasia (CIN) in a massive scale. We used molecular cytogenetics to achieve detailed karyotyping in 10 human ALT neoplastic cell lines.We identified 518 clonal recombinant chromosomes affected by 649 structural rearrangements. While all human chromosomes were involved in random or clonal, terminal, or pericentromeric rearrangements and were capable to undergo telomere healing at broken ends, a differential recombinatorial propensity of specific genomic regions was noted.We show that ALT cells undergo epigenetic modifications rendering polycentric chromosomes functionally monocentric, and because of increased terminal recombinogenicity, they generate clonal recombinant chromosomes with interstitial telomeric repeats. Losses of chromosomes 13, X, and 22, gains of 2, 3, 5, and 20, and translocation/deletion events involving several common chromosomal fragile sites (CFSs) were recurrent. Long-term reconstitution of telomerase activity in ALT cells reduced significantly the rates of random ongoing telomeric and pericentromeric CIN. However, the contribution of CFS in overall CIN remained unaffected, suggesting that in ALT cells whole-genome replication stress is not suppressed by telomerase activation. Our results provide novel insights into ALT-driven CIN, unveiling in parallel specific genomic sites that may harbor genes critical for ALT cancerous cell growth.",

For these studies, we used 1) 3D reconstituted basement membrane overlay cultures of human carcinomas, 2) live cell imaging assays to assess proteolysis, and 3) in vivo imaging of active tumor proteases. At pHe 6.8, there were increases in pericellular active cysteine cathepsins and in degradation of dye-quenched collagen IV, which was partially blocked by a cathepsin B inhibitor. Imaging probes for active cysteine cathepsins localized to tumors in vivo. The amount of bound probe decreased in tumors in bicarbonate-treated mice, a treatment previously shown to increase peritumoral pHe and reduce local invasion of the tumors.

Xenografts were found to be highly representative of their respective tumors, with a high degree of genetic stability observed by STR profiling and mutation analysis.

While some differences exist between the primary tumors and corresponding xenografts, the molecular profiles remain stable after extensive passaging.

A key enzyme in the NAD salvage pathway is nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT), and here, we describe GNE-618, an NAMPT inhibitor that depletes NAD and induces cell death in vitro and in vivo. While cells proficient for nicotinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase (NAPRT1) can be protected from NAMPT inhibition as they convert nicotinic acid (NA) to NAD independent of the salvage pathway, this protection only occurs if NA is added before NAD depletion. We also demonstrate that tumor cells are unable to generate NAD by de novo synthesis as they lack expression of key enzymes in this pathway, thus providing a mechanistic rationale for the reliance of tumor cells on the NAD salvage pathway. Identifying tumors that are sensitive to NAMPT inhibition is one potential way to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of an NAMPT inhibitor, and here, we show that NAMPT, but not NAPRT1, mRNA and protein levels inversely correlate with sensitivity to GNE-618 across a panel of 53 non-small cell lung carcinoma cell lines. Finally, we demonstrate that GNE-618 reduced tumor growth in a patient-derived model, which is thought to more closely represent heterogeneous primary patient tumors. Thus, we show that dependence of tumor cells on the NAD salvage pathway renders them sensitive to GNE-618 in vitro and in vivo, and our data support further evaluation of the use of NAMPT mRNA and protein levels as predictors of overall sensitivity.",

     "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the study were to evaluate the allosteric mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor BAY 86-9766 in monotherapy and in combination with sorafenib in orthotopic and subcutaneous hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) models with different underlying etiologies in two species. DESIGN: Antiproliferative potential of BAY 86-9766 and synergistic effects with sorafenib were studied in several HCC cell lines. Relevant pathway signaling was studied in MH3924a cells. For in vivo testing, the HCC cells were implanted subcutaneously or orthotopically. Survival and mode of action (MoA) were analyzed. RESULTS: BAY 86-9766 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity in HCC cell lines with half-maximal inhibitory concentration values ranging from 33 to 762 nM. BAY 86-9766 was strongly synergistic with sorafenib in suppressing tumor cell proliferation and inhibiting phosphorylation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). BAY 86-9766 prolonged survival in Hep3B xenografts, murine Hepa129 allografts, and MH3924A rat allografts. Additionally, tumor growth, ascites formation, and serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were reduced. Synergistic effects in combination with sorafenib were shown in Huh-7, Hep3B xenografts, and MH3924A allografts. On the signaling pathway level, the combination of BAY 86-9766 and sorafenib led to inhibition of the upregulatory feedback loop toward MEK phosphorylation observed after BAY 86-9766 monotreatment. With regard to the underlying MoA, inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, tumor cell proliferation, and microvessel density was observed in vivo. CONCLUSION: BAY 86-9766 shows potent single-agent antitumor activity and acts synergistically in combination with sorafenib in preclinical HCC models. These results support the ongoing clinical development of BAY 86-9766 and sorafenib in advanced HCC.",

     "abstract": "The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is activated in most advanced prostate cancers, yet so far treatments with PI3K inhibitors have been at best tumorostatic in preclinical cancer models and do not show significant antitumor efficacy in clinical trials. Results from tissue culture experiments in prostate cancer cells suggest that PI3K inhibitors should be combined with other cytotoxic agents; however, the general toxicity of such combinations prevents translating these experimental data into preclinical and clinical models. We investigated the emerging concept of tumor-targeted synthetic lethality in prostate cancer cells by using the pan-PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 and the immunotoxin J591PE, a protein chimera between the single-chain variable fragment of the monoclonal antibody J591 against the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) and the truncated form of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PE38QQR). The combination of ZSTK474 and J591PE increased apoptosis within 6 hours and cell death (monitored at 24\u201348 hours) in the PSMA-expressing cells LNCaP, C4-2, and C4-2Luc but not in control cells that do not express PSMA (PC3 and BT549 cells). Mechanistic analysis suggested that induction of apoptosis requires Bcl-2-associated death promoter (BAD) dephosphorylation and decreased expression of myeloid leukemia cell differentiation protein 1 (MCL-1). A single injection of ZSTK474 and J591PE into engrafted prostate cancer C4-2Luc cells led to consistent and stable reduction of luminescence within 6 days. These results suggest that the combination of a PI3K inhibitor and a PSMA-targeted protein synthesis inhibitor toxin represents a promising novel strategy for advanced prostate cancer therapy that should be further investigated.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer has one of the poorest prognoses among all cancers partly because of its persistent resistance to chemotherapy. The currently limited treatment options for pancreatic cancer underscore the need for more efficient agents. Because activating Kras mutations initiate and maintain pancreatic cancer, inhibition of this pathway should have a major therapeutic impact. We synthesized phospho-farnesylthiosalicylic acid (PFTS; MDC-1016) and evaluated its efficacy, safety, and metabolism in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer. PFTS inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in culture in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In an MIA PaCa-2 xenograft mouse model, PFTS at a dose of 50 and 100 mg/kg significantly reduced tumor growth by 62% and 65% (P < .05 vs vehicle control). Furthermore, PFTS prevented pancreatitis-accelerated acinar-to-ductal metaplasia in mice with activated Kras. PFTS appeared to be safe, with the animals showing no signs of toxicity during treatment. Following oral administration, PFTS was rapidly absorbed, metabolized to FTS and FTS glucuronide, and distributed through the blood to body organs. Mechanistically, PFTS inhibited Ras-GTP, the active form of Ras, both in vitro and in vivo, leading to the inhibition of downstream effector pathways c-RAF/mitogen-activated protein-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK1/2 kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT. In addition, PFTS proved to be a strong combination partner with phospho-valproic acid, a novel signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) inhibitor, displaying synergy in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer growth. In conclusion, PFTS, a direct Ras inhibitor, is an efficacious agent for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in preclinical models, deserving further evaluation.",

     "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a central regulator of tumor progression in a variety of human cancers. Cetuximab is an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody that has been approved for head and neck and colorectal cancer treatment, but many patients treated with cetuximab don't respond or eventually acquire resistance. To determine how tumor cells acquire resistance to cetuximab, we previously developed a model of acquired resistance using the non-small cell lung cancer line NCI-H226. These cetuximab-resistant (CtxR) cells exhibit increased steady-state EGFR expression secondary to alterations in EGFR trafficking and degradation and, further, retained dependence on EGFR signaling for enhanced growth potential. Here, we examined Sym004, a novel mixture of antibodies directed against distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of EGFR, as an alternative therapy for CtxR tumor cells. Sym004 treatment of CtxR clones resulted in rapid EGFR degradation, followed by robust inhibition of cell proliferation and down-regulation of several mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. To determine whether Sym004 could have therapeutic benefit in vivo, we established de novo CtxR NCI-H226 mouse xenografts and subsequently treated CtxR tumors with Sym004. Sym004 treatment of mice harboring CtxR tumors resulted in growth delay compared to mice continued on cetuximab. Levels of total and phospho-EGFR were robustly decreased in CtxR tumors treated with Sym004. Immunohistochemical analysis of these Sym004-treated xenograft tumors further demonstrated decreased expression of Ki67, and phospho-rpS6, as well as a modest increase in cleaved caspase-3. These results indicate that Sym004 may be an effective targeted therapy for CtxR tumors.",

Dysregulation of ETS transcription factors is also known to exist in Ewing's sarcoma, breast cancer, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We previously discovered that ERG, the predominant ETS family member in prostate cancer, interacts with the DNA damage response protein poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) in human prostate cancer specimens. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ERG-PARP1 interaction may confer radiation resistance by increasing DNA repair efficiency and that this radio-resistance could be reversed through PARP1 inhibition. Using lentiviral approaches, we established isogenic models of ERG overexpression in PC3 and DU145 prostate cancer cell lines. In both cell lines, ERG overexpression increased clonogenic survival following radiation by 1.25 (\u00b10.07) fold (mean \u00b1 SEM) and also resulted in increased PARP1 activity. PARP1 inhibition with olaparib preferentially radiosensitized ERG-positive cells by a factor of 1.52 (\u00b10.03) relative to ERG-negative cells (P < .05). Neutral and alkaline COMET assays and immunofluorescence microscopy assessing \u03b3-H2AX foci showed increased short- and long-term efficiencies of DNA repair, respectively, following radiation that was preferentially reversed by PARP1 inhibition. These findings were verified in an in vivo xenograft model. Our findings demonstrate that ERG overexpression confers radiation resistance through increased efficiency of DNA repair following radiation that can be reversed through inhibition of PARP1. These results motivate the use of PARP1 inhibitors as radiosensitizers in patients with localized ETS fusion-positive cancers.",

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is an important risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer; however, the mechanism of tumorigenesis especially tumor progression to malignancy in the inflamed colon is still unclear. Our study shows that epithelial signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), persistently activated in inflamed colon, is not required for inflammation-induced epithelial overproliferation and the development of early-stage tumors; however, it is essential for tumor progression to advanced malignancy. We found that one of the mechanisms that epithelial STAT3 regulates in tumor progression might be to modify leukocytic infiltration in the large intestine. Activation of epithelial STAT3 promotes the infiltration of the CD8+ lymphocyte population but inhibits the recruitment of regulatory T (Treg) lymphocytes. The loss of Stat3 in epithelial cells promoted the expression of cytokines/chemokines including CCL19, CCL28, and RANTES, which are known to be able to recruit Treg lymphocytes. Linked to these changes was the pathway mediated by sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor 1 and sphingosine 1-phosphate kinases, which is activated in colonic epithelial cells in inflamed colon with functional STAT3 but not in epithelial cells deleted of STAT3. Our data suggest that epithelial STAT3 plays a critical role in inflammation-induced tumor progression through regulation of leukocytic recruitment especially the infiltration of Treg cells in the large intestine.",

Continued activation of androgen receptor (AR) signaling is attributed as one of the most important mechanisms underlying failure of therapy. Recently, the discovery of constitutively active AR splice variants (AR-Vs) adds more credence to this idea. Expression of AR-Vs in metastases portends a rapid progression of the tumor. However, the precise role of the AR-Vs in CRPC still remains unknown. ARv567es is one of the two AR variants frequently found in human CRPC xenografts and metastases. Herein, we developed a probasin (Pb) promoter-driven ARv567es transgenic mouse, Pb-ARv567es, to evaluate the role of ARv567es in both autonomous prostate growth and progression to CRPC. We found that expression of ARv567es in the prostate results in epithelial hyperplasia by 16 weeks and invasive adenocarcinoma is evident by 1 year of age. The underlying genetic cellular events involved a cell cycle-related transcriptome and differential expression of a spectrum of genes that are critical for tumor initiation and progression. These findings indicate that ARv567es could induce tumorigenesis de novo and signifies the critical role of AR-Vs in CRPC. Thus, the Pb-ARv567es mouse could provide a novel model in which the role of AR variants in prostate cancer progression can be examined.",

Seven-week-old mice were treated with a single dose of NNK (10 \u00b5mol/mouse) by intraperitoneal injection and, 3 weeks later, were randomized to mice fed a control diet or experimental diets containing 50 or 100 ppm CP-31398 or 150 or 300 ppm Prima-1 for either 17 weeks (10 mice/group) or 34 weeks (15 mice/group) to assess the efficacy against lung adenoma and adenocarcinoma.

Importantly, these results suggest that both p53 modulators cause a delay in the progression of adenoma to adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tumors from mice exposed to p53-modulating agents showed a significantly reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased accumulation of wild-type p53 in the nucleus. An increase in p21- and apoptotic-positive cells was also observed in lung tumors of mice exposed to p53-modulating agents.

To understand the precise mechanism(s) of Tpl2 inhibition in endothelial cells, this study investigated the role of Tpl2 in mediating angiogenic signals using in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo models. Results showed that inhibition of Tpl2 inhibitor significantly reduced peritoneal dissemination in a mouse model by positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging. Simultaneously, inhibiting Tpl2 blocked angiogenesis in tumor nodules and prevented angiogenic factor-induced proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1 (CXCL1) increased Tpl2 kinase activity and phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, Tpl2 inhibition or ablation by siRNA prevented the angiogenic signal-induced tube formation in Matrigel plug assay or aortic ring assay. Inhibiting Tpl2 also prevented the angiogenic factor-induced chemotactic motility and migration of endothelial cells. Tpl2 inhibition by CXCL1 or epidermal growth factor in endothelial cells was associated with inactivation of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2, nuclear factor \u03ba light-chain enhancer of activated B cells, and activating protein 1 and suppression of VEGF expression. Thus, Tpl2 inhibitors thwart Tpl2-regulated VEGF by inactivating transcription factors involved in angiogenic factor-triggered endothelial cell angiogenesis.

An issue that continues to challenge effective RMS patient prognosis is the dearth of molecular markers predictive of disease stage irrespective of tumor subtype. Our study involving a panel of 70 RMS tumors has identified specific alternative splice variants of the oncogenes Murine Double Minute 2 (MDM2) and MDM4 as potential biomarkers for RMS. Our results have demonstrated the strong association of genotoxic-stress inducible splice forms MDM2-ALT1 (91.6% Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group stage 4 tumors) and MDM4-ALT2 (90.9% MDM4-ALT2-positive T2 stage tumors) with high-risk metastatic RMS. Moreover, MDM2-ALT1-positive metastatic tumors belonged to both the alveolar (50%) and embryonal (41.6%) subtypes, making this the first known molecular marker for high-grade metastatic disease across the most common RMS subtypes. Furthermore, our results show that MDM2-ALT1 expression can function by directly contribute to metastatic behavior and promote the invasion of RMS cells through a matrigel-coated membrane. Additionally, expression of both MDM2-ALT1 and MDM4-ALT2 increased anchorage-independent cell-growth in soft agar assays. Intriguingly, we observed a unique coordination in the splicing of MDM2-ALT1 and MDM4-ALT2 in approximately 24% of tumor samples in a manner similar to genotoxic stress response in cell lines. To further explore splicing network alterations with possible relevance to RMS disease, we used an exon microarray approach to examine stress-inducible splicing in an RMS cell line (Rh30) and observed striking parallels between stress-responsive alternative splicing and constitutive splicing in RMS tumors.",

Little is known, however, as to how the HSC niche may regulate dormancy in cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the effects of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) on PCa dormancy in the BM niche. We found that binding with niche osteoblasts induces the expression of TBK1 in PCa cells PC3 and C4-2B. Interestingly, TBK1 interacts with mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and inhibits its function. Rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, induces cell cycle arrest of PCa cells and enhances chemotherapeutic resistance of PCa cells. As a result, the knockdown of TBK1 decreases PCa stem-like cells and drug resistance in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, these results strongly indicate that TBK1 plays an important role in the dormancy and drug resistance of PCa.",

     "abstract": "High abundance of c-Jun is detected in invasive breast cancer cells and aggressive breast tumor malignancies. Here, we demonstrate that a major cause of high c-Jun abundance in invasive breast cancer cells is prolonged c-Jun protein stability owing to poor poly-ubiquitination of c-Jun. Among the known c-Jun-targeting E3 ligases, we identified constitutive photomorphogenesis protein 1 (COP1) as an E3 ligase responsible for c-Jun degradation in less invasive breast cancer cells because depletion of COP1 reduced c-Jun poly-ubiquitination leading to the stabilization of c-Jun protein. In a panel of breast cancer cell lines, we observed an inverse association between the levels of COP1 and c-Jun. However, overexpressing COP1 alone was unable to decrease c-Jun level in invasive breast cancer cells, indicating that efficient c-Jun protein degradation necessitates an additional event. Indeed, we found that glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) inhibitors elevated c-Jun abundance in less invasive breast cancer cells and that GSK3\u03b2 nonphosphorylable c-Jun-T239A mutant displayed greater protein stability and poorer poly-ubiquitination compared to the wild-type c-Jun. The ability of simultaneously enforced expression of COP1 and constitutively active GSK3\u03b2 to decrease c-Jun abundance in invasive breast cancer cells allowed us to conclude that c-Jun is negatively regulated through the coordinated action of COP1 and GSK3\u03b2. Importantly, co-expressing COP1 and active GSK3\u03b2 blocked in vitro cell growth/migration and in vivo metastasis of invasive breast cancer cells. Gene expression profiling of breast tumor specimens further revealed that higher COP1 expression correlated with better recurrence-free survival. Our study supports the notion that COP1 is a suppressor of breast cancer progression.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNA-130b (miR-130b) is involved in several biologic processes; its role in colorectal tumorigenesis has not been addressed so far. Herein, we demonstrate that miR-130b up-regulation exhibits clinical relevance as it is linked to advanced colorectal cancers (CRCs), poor patients' prognosis, and molecular features of enhanced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis. miR-130b high-expressing cells develop large, dedifferentiated, and vascularized tumors in mouse xenografts, features that are reverted by intratumor injection of a specific antisense RNA. In contrast, injection of the corresponding mimic in mouse xenografts from miR-130b low-expressing cells increases tumor growth and angiogenic potential while reduces the epithelial hallmarks. These biologic effects are reproduced in human CRC cell lines. We identify peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) as an miR-130b direct target in CRC in vitro and in vivo. Notably, the effects of PPAR\u03b3 gain- and loss-of-function phenocopy those due to miR-130b down-regulation or up-regulation, respectively, underscoring their biologic relevance. Furthermore, we provide mechanistic evidences that most of the miR-130b-dependent effects are due to PPAR\u03b3 suppression that in turn deregulates PTEN, E-cadherin, Snail, and vascular endothelial growth factor, key mediators of cell proliferation, EMT, and angiogenesis. Since higher levels of miR-130b are found in advanced tumor stages (III\u2013IV), we propose a novel role of the miR-130b-PPAR\u03b3 axis in fostering the progression toward more invasive CRCs. Detection of onco-miR-130b and its association with PPAR\u03b3 may be useful as a prognostic biomarker. Its targeting in vivo should be evaluated as a novel effective therapeutic tool against CRC.",

     "abstract": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) facilitates the escape of epithelial cancer cells from the primary tumor site, which is a key event early in metastasis. Here, we explore how extrinsic, tumor microenvironmental cytokines cooperate with intrinsic, genetic changes to promote EMT in human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs). Viral transduction of transforming genetic events into HMECs routinely generated two distinct cell populations. One population retained epithelial characteristics, while an emergent population spontaneously acquired a mesenchymal morphology and properties associated with cancer stem cells (CSCs). Interestingly, the spontaneous mesenchymal/CSCs were unable to differentiate and lacked epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. In contrast, exposure of the transformed HMECs retaining epithelial characteristics to exogenous transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) generated a mesenchymal/CSC population with remarkable plasticity. The TGF-\u03b2-induced mesenchymal/CSC population was dependent on the continued presence of TGF-\u03b2. Removal of TGF-\u03b2 or pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of TGF-\u03b2/SMAD signaling led to the reversion of mesenchymal/CSC to epithelial/non-CSC. Our results demonstrate that targeting exogenous cytokine signaling disrupts epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity and may be an effective strategy to inhibit the emergence of circulating tumor cells. The model of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity we describe here can be used to identify novel tumor microenvironmental factors and downstream signaling that cooperate with intrinsic genetic changes to drive metastasis. Understanding the interaction between extrinsic and intrinsic factors that regulate epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity will allow the development of new therapies that target tumor microenvironmental signals to reduce metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) is the etiologic agent of adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and various inflammatory disorders including HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis. HTLV-I oncoprotein Tax is known to cause permanent activation of many cellular transcription factors including nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB), cyclic adenosine 3\u2032,5\u2032-monophosphate response element-binding protein, and activator protein 1 (AP-1). Here, we show that NF-\u03baB-binding cofactor inhibitor of NF-\u03baB-\u03b6 (I\u03baB-\u03b6) is constitutively expressed in HTLV-I-infected T cell lines and ATL cells, and Tax transactivates the I\u03baB-\u03b6 gene, mainly through NF-\u03baB.

The transcriptional activation domain, nuclear localization signal, and NF-\u03baB-binding domain of I\u03baB-\u03b6 were required for Bcl3 induction, and I\u03baB-\u03b6 synergistically enhanced Tax-induced Bcl3 transactivation in an NF-\u03baB-dependent manner. Interestingly, I\u03baB-\u03b6 inhibited Tax-induced NF-\u03baB, AP-1 activation, and HTLV-I transcription. Furthermore, I\u03baB-\u03b6 interacted with Tax in vitro and this interaction was also observed in an HTLV-I-transformed T cell line. These results suggest that I\u03baB-\u03b6 modulates Tax-dependent and Tax-independent gene transcription in T cells.

Thus, we investigated the pharmacodynamics and tumor saturation kinetics of a death receptor 5 antibody (anti-DR5) when combined with chemotherapeutics. For our investigations, we applied an imaging method that allows monitoring of apoptosis noninvasively in living mice. A stably transfected apoptosis reporter based on split luciferase technology facilitates to screen various chemotherapeutics and anti-DR5 on their ability to induce apoptosis in glioblastoma cells in vitro as well as in vivo. We found that doxorubicin (DOX) treatment in vitro led to significant apoptosis induction within 48 hours and to a 2.3-fold increased anti-DR5 binding to the cell surface. In contrast, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment altered anti-DR5 binding only marginally. Induction of apoptosis by treatment with anti-DR5 was dose- and time-dependent (both in vitro and in vivo). Simultaneous visualization of fluorescence-labeled anti-DR5 in tumor tissue and apoptosis revealed maximal apoptosis induction immediately after the compound had reached tumor site. Regarding combination therapy of anti-DR5 and DOX, we found that the sequential application of DOX before anti-DR5 resulted in synergistically enhanced apoptosis reporter activity. In striking contrast, anti-DR5 given before DOX did not lead to increased apoptosis induction. We suggest that DOX-induced recruitment of DR5 to the cell surface impacts the enhanced apoptotic effect that can be longitudinally monitored by apoptosis imaging. This study demonstrates that the combination of apoptosis and fluorescence imaging is an excellent method for optimizing dosing and treatment schedules in preclinical cancer models.",

With the extracellular matrix (ECM) being an essential constituent of non-transformed tissues and tumors, we asked whether exosomes from a metastatic rat tumor also affect the organization of the ECM and whether this has consequences on host and tumor cell motility. TEX bind to individual components of the ECM, the preferential partner depending on the exosomes' adhesion molecule profile such that high CD44 expression is accompanied by hyaluronic acid binding and high \u03b16\u03b24 expression by laminin (LN) 332 binding, which findings were confirmed by antibody blocking. TEX can bind to the tumor matrix already during exosome delivery but also come in contact with distinct organ matrices. Being rich in proteases, TEX modulate the ECM as demonstrated for degradation of collagens, LNs, and fibronectin. Matrix degradation by TEX has severe consequences on tumor and host cell adhesion, motility, and invasiveness. By ECM degradation, TEX also promote host cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance. Taken together, the host tissue ECM modulation by TEX is an important factor in the cross talk between a tumor and the host including premetastatic niche preparation and the recruitment of hematopoietic cells. Reorganization of the ECM by exosomes likely also contributes to organogenesis, physiological and pathologic angiogenesis, wound healing, and clotting after vessel disruption.",

Increased expression of TRADD is sufficient to activate NF-\u03baB. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of NF-\u03baB activation as a key pathogenic mechanism in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults.We examined the expression of TRADD by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and find that TRADD is commonly expressed at high levels in GBM and is detected in both cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. Cytoplasmic IHC TRADD scoring is significantly associated with worse progression-free survival (PFS) both in univariate and multivariate analysis but is not associated with overall survival (n = 43 GBMs). PFS is a marker for responsiveness to treatment. We propose that TRADD-mediated NF-\u03baB activation confers chemoresistance and thus a worse PFS in GBM. Consistent with the effect on PFS, silencing TRADD in glioma cells results in decreased NF-\u03baB activity, decreased proliferation of cells, and increased sensitivity to temozolomide. TRADD expression is common in glioma-initiating cells. Importantly, silencing TRADD in GBM-initiating stem cell cultures results in decreased viability of stem cells, suggesting that TRADD may be required for maintenance of GBM stem cell populations. Thus, our study suggests that increased expression of cytoplasmic TRADD is both an important biomarker and a key driver of NF-\u03baB activation in GBM and supports an oncogenic role for TRADD in GBM.",

     "abstract": "We previously reported the association of elevated levels of the multifunctional transcription factor, CCCTC binding factor (CTCF), in breast cancer cells with the specific anti-apoptotic function of CTCF. To understand the molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon, we investigated regulation of the human Bax gene by CTCF in breast and non-breast cells. Two CTCF binding sites (CTSs) within the Bax promoter were identified. In all cells, breast and non-breast, active histone modifications were present at these CTSs, DNA harboring this region was unmethylated, and levels of Bax mRNA and protein were similar. Nevertheless, up-regulation of Bax mRNA and protein and apoptotic cell death were observed only in breast cancer cells depleted of CTCF. We proposed that increased CTCF binding to the Bax promoter in breast cancer cells, by comparison with non-breast cells, may be mechanistically linked to the specific apoptotic phenotype in CTCF-depleted breast cancer cells. In this study, we show that CTCF binding was enriched at the Bax CTSs in breast cancer cells and tumors; in contrast, binding of other transcription factors (SP1, WT1, EGR1, and c-Myc) was generally increased in non-breast cells and normal breast tissues. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism for CTCF in the epigenetic regulation of Bax in breast cancer cells, whereby elevated levels of CTCF support preferential binding of CTCF to the Bax CTSs. In this context, CTCF functions as a transcriptional repressor counteracting influences of positive regulatory factors; depletion of breast cancer cells from CTCF therefore results in the activation of Bax and apoptosis.",

However, little is known concerning the molecular events preceding the development of lung cancer. In this study, we characterize a chemically induced lung cancer mouse model in which lung cancer developed in the presence of silicotic chronic inflammation. Silica-induced lung inflammation increased the incidence and multiplicity of lung cancer in mice treated with N-nitrosodimethylamine, a carcinogen found in tobacco smoke. Histologic and molecular analysis revealed that concomitant chronic inflammation contributed to lung tumorigenesis through induction of preneoplastic changes in lung epithelial cells. In addition, silica-mediated inflammation generated an immunosuppressive microenvironment in which we observed increased expression of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), transforming growth factor-\u03b21, monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG3), and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), as well as the presence of regulatory T cells. Finally, the K-RAS mutational profile of the tumors changed from Q61R to G12D mutations in the inflammatory milieu. In summary, we describe some of the early molecular changes associated to lung carcinogenesis in a chronic inflammatory microenvironment and provide novel information concerning the mechanisms underlying the formation and the fate of preneoplastic lesions in the silicotic lung.",

The relative contribution of local and circulating fibronectin to blood vessel formation in vivo remains unknown despite evidence for unexpected roles of circulating fibronectin in various diseases. Using transgenic mouse models, we established that circulating fibronectin facilitates the growth of bone metastases by enhancing blood vessel formation and maturation. This effect is more relevant than that of fibronectin produced by endothelial cells and pericytes, which only exert a small additive effect on vessel maturation. Circulating fibronectin enhances its local production in tumors through a positive feedback loop and increases the amount of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) retained in the matrix. Both fibronectin and VEGF then cooperate to stimulate blood vessel formation. Fibronectin content in the tumor correlates with the number of blood vessels and tumor growth in the mouse models. Consistent with these results, examination of three separate arrays from patients with breast and prostate cancers revealed that a high staining intensity for fibronectin in tumors is associated with increased mortality. These results establish that circulating fibronectin modulates blood vessel formation and tumor growth by modifying the amount of and the response to VEGF. Furthermore, determination of the fibronectin content can serve as a prognostic biomarker for breast and prostate cancers and possibly other cancers.",

Here, we show that CDK inhibitors exhibit an order of magnitude greater cytotoxic potency than a suite of inhibitors targeting RTK and Ras-MAPK signaling in cell lines representative of clinically recognized breast cancer (BC) subtypes. Drug combination studies show that the pan-CDK inhibitor, flavopiridol (FPD), synergistically potentiated cytotoxicity induced by the Raf inhibitor, sorafenib (SFN). This synergy was most pronounced at sub-EC50 SFN concentrations in MDA-MB-231 (KRAS-G13D and BRAF-G464V mutations), MDA-MB-468 [epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression], and SKBR3 [ErbB2/EGFR2 (HER-2) overexpression] cells but not in hormone-dependent MCF-7 and T47D cells. Potentiation of SFN cytotoxicity by FPD correlated with enhanced apoptosis, suppression of retinoblastoma (Rb) signaling, and reduced Mcl-1 expression. SFN and FPD were also tested in an MDA-MB-231 mammary fat pad engraftment model of tumorigenesis. Mice treated with both drugs exhibited reduced primary tumor growth rates and metastatic tumor load in the lungs compared to treatment with either drug alone, and this correlated with greater reductions in Rb signaling and Mcl-1 expression in resected tumors.

Here, we show that PTEN exerts unconventional oncogenic effects in glioblastoma through a novel PTEN/mutant p53/c-Myc/Bcl-XL molecular and functional axis. Using a wide array of molecular, genetic, and functional approaches, we demonstrate that PTEN enhances a transcriptional complex containing gain-of-function mutant p53, CBP, and NFY in human glioblastoma cells and tumor tissues. The mutant p53/CBP/NFY complex transcriptionally activates the oncogenes c-Myc and Bcl-XL, leading to increased cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and clonogenicity. Disruption of the mutant p53/c-Myc/Bcl-XL axis or mutant p53/CBP/NFY complex reverses the transcriptional and oncogenic effects of PTEN and unmasks its tumor-suppressive function. Consistent with these data, we find that PTEN expression is associated with worse patient survival than PTEN loss in tumors harboring mutant p53 and that a small molecule modulator of p53 exerts greater antitumor effects in PTEN-expressing cancer cells. Altogether, our study describes a new signaling pathway that mediates context-dependent oncogenic/tumor-suppressive role of PTEN.

BaF3 lines were used to assess the ability of each mutation to confer cross-resistance to PD173074 and ponatinib. Unlike PD173074, ponatinib effectively inhibited all the dovitinib-resistant FGFR2 mutants except the V565I gatekeeper mutation, suggesting ponatinib but not dovitinib targets the active conformation of FGFR2 kinase. EC cell lines expressing wild-type FGFR2 were relatively resistant to all inhibitors, whereas EC cell lines expressing mutated FGFR2 showed differential sensitivity. Within the FGFR2mutant cell lines, three of seven showed marked resistance to PD173074 and relative resistance to dovitinib and ponatinib. This suggests that alternative mechanisms distinct from kinase domain mutations are responsible for intrinsic resistance in these three EC lines. Finally, overexpression of FGFR2N550K in JHUEM-2 cells (FGFR2C383R) conferred resistance (about five-fold) to PD173074, providing independent data that FGFR2N550K can be associated with drug resistance. Biochemical in vitro kinase analyses also show that ponatinib is more effective than dovitinib at inhibiting FGFR2N550K. We propose that tumors harboring mutationally activated FGFRs should be treated with FGFR inhibitors that specifically bind the active kinase.",

     "abstract": "As tumors continue to grow and exceed their blood supply, nutrients become limited leading to deficiencies in amino acids (AAD), glucose (GD), and oxygen (hypoxia). These alterations result in significant changes in gene expression. While tumors have been shown to overcome the stress associated with GD or hypoxia by stimulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis, the role of AAD in tumor angiogenesis remains to be elucidated. We found that in human tumors, the expression of the general control non-derepressible 2 (GCN2, an AAD sensor) kinase is elevated at both protein and mRNA levels. In vitro studies revealed that VEGF expression is universally induced by AAD treatment in all five cell lines tested (five of five). This is in contrast to two other angiogenesis mediators interleukin-6 (two of five) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (two of five) that have a more restricted expression. Suppressing GCN2 expression significantly decreased AAD-induced VEGF expression. Silencing activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a downstream transcription factor of the GCN2 signaling pathway, is also associated with strong inhibition of AAD-induced VEGF expression. PKR-like kinase, the key player in GD-induced unfolded protein response is not involved in this process. In vivo xenograft tumor studies in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient mice confirmed that knockdown of GCN2 in tumor cells retards tumor growth and decreases tumor blood vessel density. Our results reveal that the GCN2/ATF4 pathway promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis through AAD-mediated VEGF expression and, thus, is a potential target in cancer therapy.",

The discovery of small molecule inhibitors that selectively target PI3K or PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) provides an opportunity to pharmacologically determine the contribution of these key signaling nodes in VEGF-A-driven tumor angiogenesis in vivo. This study used an array of microvascular imaging techniques to monitor the antivascular effects of selective class I PI3K, mTOR, or dual PI3K/ mTOR inhibitors in colorectal and prostate cancer xenograft models. Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) angiography, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), vessel size index (VSI) MRI, and DCE ultrasound (DCE-U/S) were employed to quantitatively evaluate the vascular (structural and physiological) response to these inhibitors. GDC-0980, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, was found to reduce micro-CT angiography vascular density, while VSI MRI demonstrated a significant reduction in vessel density and an increase in mean vessel size, consistent with a loss of small functional vessels and a substantial antivascular response. DCE-MRI showed that GDC-0980 produces a strong functional response by decreasing the vascular permeability/perfusion-related parameter, Ktrans. Interestingly, comparable antivascular effects were observed for both GDC-980 and GNE-490 (a selective class I PI3K inhibitor). In addition, mTOR-selective inhibitors did not affect vascular density, suggesting that PI3K inhibition is sufficient to generate structural changes, characteristic of a robust antivascular response. This study supports the use of noninvasive microvascular imaging techniques (DCE-MRI, VSI MRI, DCE-U/S) as pharmacodynamic assays to quantitatively measure the activity of PI3K and dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Desmoid tumor (also called aggressive fibromatosis) is a lesion of mesenchymal origin that can occur as a sporadic tumor or a manifestation of the preneoplastic syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis caused by a mutation in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). This tumor type is characterized by the stabilization of \u03b2-catenin and activation of Tcf-mediated transcription. Cell transplantation data suggest that desmoid tumors are derived from mesenchymal progenitor cells (MSCs). As such, modulating cell signaling pathways that regulate MSC differentiation or proliferation, such as hedgehog (Hh) signaling, could alter the tumor phenotype. Here, we found that Hh signaling is activated in human and murine desmoid tumors. Inhibiting Hh signaling in human cell cultures decreased cell proliferation and \u03b2-catenin protein levels. Apc+/Apc1638N mice, which develop desmoid tumors, develop smaller and fewer tumors when Hh signaling was inhibited either genetically (by crossing Apc+/Apc1638N mice with mice lacking one copy of a Hh-activated transcription factor, Gli2+/-mice) or using a pharmacologic inhibitor. Both in mice and in human tumor cell cultures, \u03b2-catenin and Hh-mediated signaling positively regulate each other's activity. These data show that targeting a pathway that regulates MSC differentiation influences desmoid tumor behavior, providing functional evidence supporting the notion that these tumors are derived from mesenchymal progenitors. It also suggests Hh blockade as a therapeutic approach for this tumor type.",

Themost common upstream fusion partner described is the androgenregulated prostate-specific gene TMPRSS2, most frequently with ERG, but additional 5\u2032fusion partners have been described. We performed 5\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends in 18 PCas with ETV1, ETV4, or ETV5 outlier expression to identify the 5\u2032 fusion partners. We also evaluated the exon-level expression profile of these ETS genes in 14 cases. We identified and confirmed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction the two novel chimeric genes OR51E2-ETV1 and UBTF-ETV4 in two PCas. OR51E2 encodes a G-protein.coupled receptor that is overexpressed in PCas, whereas UBTF is a ubiquitously expressed gene encoding an HMG-box DNA-binding protein involved in ribosome biogenesis. We additionally describe two novel gene fusion combinations of previously described genes, namely, SLC45A3- ETV4 and HERVK17-ETV4. Finally, we found one PCa with TMPRSS2-ETV1, one with C15orf21-ETV1, one with EST14-ETV1, and two with 14q133-q21.1-ETV1. In nine PCas (eight ETV1 and one ETV5), exhibiting ETS outlier expression and genomic rearrangement detected by FISH, no 5\u2032 fusion partner was found. Our findings contribute significantly to characterize the heterogeneous group of ETS gene fusions and indicate that all genes described as 5\u2032 fusion partners with one ETS gene can most likely be rearranged with any of the other ETS genes involved in prostate carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "p53, a strong tumor suppressor protein, is known to be involved in cellular senescence, particularly premature cellular senescence. Oncogenic stresses, such as Ras activation, can initiate p53-mediated senescence, whereas activation of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway can promote cell proliferation. These conflicting facts imply that there is a regulatory mechanism for balancing p53 and Ras-MAPK signaling. To address this, we evaluated the effects of p53 on the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation and found that p53 could suppress ERK activation through de novo synthesis. Through several molecular biologic analyses, we found that RKIP, an inhibitor of Raf kinase, is responsible for p53-mediated ERK suppression and senescence. Overexpression of RKIP can induce cellular senescence in several types of cell lines, including p53-deficient cells, whereas the elimination of RKIP by siRNA or forced expression of ERK blocks p53-mediated cellular senescence. These results suggested that RKIP is an essential protein for cellular senescence. Moreover, modification of the p53 serine 46 residue was critical for RKIP induction and ERK suppression as well as cellular senescence. These results indicated that RKIP is a novel p53 target gene that is responsible for p53-mediated cellular senescence and tumor suppressor protein expression.",

     "abstract": "Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) has a much poorer prognosis than the more common embryonal subtype. Most ARMS tumors characteristically possess a specific genomic translocation between the genes of PAX3/7 and FOXO1 (FKHR), which forms fusion proteins possessing the DNA binding domains of PAX3/7 and the more transcriptionally potent transactivation domain of FOXO1. We have shown that the proapoptotic BH3-only family member Noxa is upregulated by the PAX3-FOXO1 fusion transcription factor in a p53-independent manner. The increased expression of Noxa renders PAX3-FOXO1-expressing cells more susceptible to apoptosis induced by a \u0103-secretase inhibitor (GSI1, Z-LLNle-CHO), the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, and BH3 mimetic ABT-737. Apoptosis in response to bortezomib can be overcome by shRNA knockdown of Noxa. In vivo treatment with bortezomib reduced the growth of tumors derived from a PAX3-FOXO1-expressing primary myoblast tumor model and RH41 xenografts. We therefore demonstrate that PAX3-FOXO1 up-regulation of Noxa represents an unanticipated aspect of ARMS tumor biology that creates a therapeutic window to allow induction of apoptosis in ARMS cells.",

     "abstract": "Urothelial carcinoma (UC) causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying urothelial cancer development and tumor progression are still largely unknown. Using informatics analysis, we identified Sh3gl2 (endophilin A1) as a bladder urothelium-enriched transcript. The gene encoding Sh3gl2 is located on chromosome 9p, a region frequently altered in UC. Sh3gl2 is known to regulate endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases implicated in oncogenesis, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and c-Met. However, its role in UC pathogenesis is unknown. Informatics analysis of expression profiles as well as immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays revealed Sh3gl2 expression to be decreased in UC specimens compared to nontumor tissues. Loss of Sh3gl2 was associated with increasing tumor grade and with muscle invasion, which is a reliable predictor of metastatic disease and cancer-derived mortality. Sh3gl2 expression was undetectable in 19 of 20 human UC cell lines but preserved in the low-grade cell line RT4. Stable silencing of Sh3gl2 in RT4 cells by RNA interference 1) enhanced proliferation and colony formation in vitro, 2) inhibited EGF-induced EGFR internalization and increased EGFR activation, 3) stimulated phosphorylation of Src family kinases and STAT3, and 4) promoted growth of RT4 xenografts in subrenal capsule tissue recombination experiments. Conversely, forced re-expression of Sh3gl2 in T24 cells and silenced RT4 clones attenuated oncogenic behaviors, including growth and migration. Together, these findings identify loss of Sh3gl2 as a frequent event in UC development that promotes disease progression.",

While mechanisms enabling recurrent activity of androgen receptor (AR) are certainly involved in the development of CRPC, there may be factors that contribute to the process including acquired neuroendocrine (NE) cell-like behaviors working through alternate (non-AR) cell signaling systems or AR-dependent mechanisms. In this study, we explore the potential relationship between the AR axis and a novel putative marker of NE differentiation, the human male protocadherin-PC (PCDH-PC), in vitro and in human situations. We found evidence for an NE transdifferentiation process and PCDH-PC expression as an early-onset adaptive mechanism following ADT and elucidate AR as a key regulator of PCDH-PC expression. PCDH-PC overexpression, in turn, attenuates the ligand-dependent activity of the AR, enabling certain prostate tumor clones to assume a more NE phenotype and promoting their survival under diverse stress conditions. Acquisition of an NE phenotype by PCa cells positively correlated with resistance to cytotoxic agents including docetaxel, a taxane chemotherapy approved for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC. Furthermore, knockdown of PCDH-PC in cells that have undergone an NE transdifferentiation partially sensitized cells to docetaxel. Together, these results reveal a reciprocal regulation between the AR axis and PCDH-PC signals, observed both in vitro and in vivo, with potential implications in coordinating NE transdifferentiation processes and progression of PCa toward hormonal and chemoresistance.",

Here, we report that the UV-induced suppression of CHS is associated with increases in the levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and PGE2 receptors in the exposed skin. UV radiation.induced suppression of CHS was inhibited by topical treatment of the skin with celecoxib or indomethacin (inhibitors of COX-2) or AH6809 (an EP2 antagonist). Moreover, mice deficient in COX-2 were found to be resistant to UV-induced suppression of CHS. The exposure of wild-typemice to UVB radiation resulted in DNA hypermethylation, increased DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt) activity, and elevated levels of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b proteins in the skin, and these responses were downregulated on topical treatment of the site of exposure after irradiation with indomethacin or EP2 antagonist. Topical treatment of UVB-exposed COX-2.deficient mice with PGE2 enhanced the UVB-induced suppression of CHS as well as global DNA methylation and elevated the levels of Dnmt activity and Dnmt proteins in the skin. Intraperitoneal injection of 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-dc), a DNA demethylating agent, restored the CHS response to 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene in UVB-exposed skin and this was associated with the reduction in global DNA methylation and Dnmt activity and reduced levels of Dnmt proteins. Furthermore, treatment with 5-Aza-dc reversed the effect of PGE2 on UV-induced suppression of CHS in COX-2.deficient mice.

However, poor response in some tumors and emerging resistance necessitate further investigations of newdrug targets. Notch signal pathway plays a pivotal role in vascular development and tumor angiogenesis. Either blockade or forced activation of this pathway can inhibit angiogenesis. As blocking Notch pathway results in the formation of vascular neoplasm, activation of Notch pathway to prevent tumor angiogenesis might be an alternative choice. However, an in vivo deliverable reagent with highly efficient Notch-activating capacity has not been developed. Here, we generated a polypeptide, hD1R, which consists of the Delta-Serrate-Lag-2 fragment of the human Notch ligand Delta-like 1 and an arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) motif targeting endothelial cells (ECs). We showed that hD1R could bind to ECs specifically through its RGD motif and effectively triggered Notch signaling in ECs. We demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo that hD1R inhibited angiogenic sprouting and EC proliferation. In tumor-bearing mice, the injection of hD1R effectively repressed tumor growth, most likely through increasing tumor hypoxia and tissue necrosis. The amount and width of vessels reduced remarkably in tumors of mice treated with hD1R. Moreover, vessels in tumors of mice treated with hD1R recruited more NG2+ perivascular cells and were better perfused. Combined application of hD1R and chemotherapy with cisplatin and teniposide revealed that these two treatments had additive antitumor effects.

Concretely, we found that treatment of melanoma with methotrexate (MTX) altered melanogenesis and accelerated the exportation of melanosomes; however, the cellular and molecular processes by which MTX is trapped into melanosomes and exported out of cells have not been elucidated. In this study, we identified myosin Va (MyoVa) as a possible mediator of these cellular processes. The results demonstrated that melanoma treatment with MTX leads to Akt2- dependent MyoVa phosphorylation, which enhances its ability to interact with melanosomes and accelerates their exportation. To understand the mechanism(s) by which MTX activates Akt2, we examined the effects of this drug on the activity of protein phosphatase 2A, an Akt inhibitor activated by the methylation of its catalytic subunit. Taken together, this study identified a novel trafficking pathway in melanoma that promotes tumor resistance through Akt2/MyoVa activation. Because of these findings, we explored several MTX combination therapies to increase the susceptibility of melanoma to this drug. By avoiding MTX exportation, we observed that the E2F1 apoptotic pathway is functional in melanoma, and its induction activates p73 and apoptosis protease-activating factor 1 following a p53-autonomous proapoptotic signaling event.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a devastating brain tumor with a poor survival outcome. It is generated and propagated by a small subpopulation of rare and hierarchically organized cells that share stem-like features with normal stem cells but, however, appear dysregulated in terms of self-renewal and proliferation and aberrantly differentiate into cells forming the bulk of the disorganized cancer tissues. The complexity and heterogeneity of human GBMs underlie the lack of standardized and effective treatments. This study is based on the assumption that available markers defining cancer stem cells (CSCs) in all GBMs are not conclusive and further work is required to identify the CSC. We implemented a method to isolate CSCs independently from cell surface markers: four patient-derived GBM neurospheres containing stem, progenitors, and differentiated cells were labeled with PKH-26 fluorescent dye that reliably selects for cells that divide at low rate. Through in vitro and in vivo assays, we investigated the growth and self-renewal properties of the two different compartments of high- and slow-dividing cells. Our data demonstrate that only slow-dividing cells retain the ability of a long-lasting self-renewal capacity after serial in vitro passaging, while high-dividing cells eventually exhaust. Moreover, orthotopic transplantation assay revealed that the incidence of tumors generated by the slow-dividing compartment is significantly higher in the four patient-derived GBM neurospheres analyzed. Importantly, slow-dividing cells feature a population made up of homogeneous stem cells that sustain tumor growth and therefore represent a viable target for GBM therapy development.",

In human primary breast cancers, increased levels of IL-6 were found at the tumor leading edge and positively correlated with advanced stage, suggesting a mechanistic link between tumor cell production of IL-6 and invasion. In support of this hypothesis, we showed that the IL-6/Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) pathway drives tumor progression through the stroma and metastatic niche. Overexpression of IL-6 in tumor cell lines promoted myeloid cell recruitment, angiogenesis, and induced metastases. We demonstrated the therapeutic potential of interrupting this pathway with IL-6 receptor blockade or by inhibiting its downstream effectors JAK1/2 or Stat3. These clinically relevant interventions did not inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro but had profound effects in vivo on tumor progression, interfering broadly with tumor-supportive stromal functions, including angiogenesis, fibroblast infiltration, and myeloid suppressor cell recruitment in both the tumor and pre-metastatic niche. This study provides the first evidence for IL-6 expression at the leading edge of invasive human breast tumors and demonstrates mechanistically that IL-6/JAK/Stat3 signaling plays a critical and pharmacologically targetable role in orchestrating the composition of the tumor microenvironment that promotes growth, invasion, and metastasis.",

In particular, transgenic expression of CDC25A cooperates with HER2 in promoting mammary tumors, whereas CDC25A hemizygous loss attenuates the HER2-induced tumorigenesis penetrance. On the basis of this evidence of a synergism between HER2 and the cell cycle regulator CDC25A in a mouse model of mammary tumorigenesis, we investigated the role of CDC25A in human HER2-positive breast cancer and its possible implications in therapeutic response. HER2 status and CDC25A expression were assessed in 313 breast cancer patients and we found statistically significant correlation between HER2 and CDC25A (P = .007). Moreover, an HER2-positive breast cancer subgroup with high levels of CDC25A and very aggressive phenotype was identified (P = .005). Importantly, our in vitro studies on breast cancer cell lines showed that the HER2 inhibitor efficacy on cell growth and viability relied also on CDC25A expression and that such inhibition induces CDC25A down-regulation through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway and DNA damage response activation. In line with this observation, we found a statistical significant association between CDC25A overexpression and trastuzumab-combined therapy response rate in two different HER2-positive cohorts of trastuzumab-treated patients in either metastatic or neoadjuvant setting (P = .018 for the metastatic cohort and P = .021 for the neoadjuvant cohort). Our findings highlight a link between HER2 and CDC25A that positively modulates HER2- targeted therapy response, suggesting that, in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, CDC25A overexpression affects trastuzumab sensitivity.",

However, the host responds to oHSV by inducing intratumoral infiltration of macrophages that can engulf the virus, limiting the potential of this therapeutic strategy. Hypervascularity is a pathognomonic feature of glioblastoma (GBM) and is a promising therapeutic target. Antiangiogenic treatments have multiple benefits, including the capacity to increase oHSV efficacy by suppressing macrophage extravasation and infiltration into the tumor. Angiostatin is an antiangiogenic polypeptide, and interleukin-12 (IL-12) is an immunostimulatory cytokine with strong antiangiogenic effects. Clinical use of each has been limited by delivery issues and systemic toxicity.We tested a combination treatment strategy using oHSVs expressing angiostatin (G47\u0394-mAngio) and IL-12 (G47\u0394-mIL12) in two orthotopic human GBMmodels. Intratumoral injection of G47\u0394-mAngio and G47\u0394-mIL12 in mice bearing intracranial U87 or tumors derived from glioblastoma stem cells significantly prolonged survival compared to each armed oHSV alone. This was associated with increased antiangiogenesis and virus spread and decreased macrophages. These data support the paradigm of using oHSV expressing different antiangiogenic agents and show for the first time that oHSVs expressing angiostatin and IL-12 can improve efficacy in human GBM models.",

     "publication date": "06-2013",
     "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of mortality from gynecological malignancy despite advancements in novel therapeutics. We have recently demonstrated that the transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) is overexpressed in epithelial ovarian carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reverse-transcribed cDNA from CtBP2 wild-type and knockdown ovarian cancer cell lines was hybridized to Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST microarrays, and differentially expressed genes were studied. Immunohistochemical analysis of CtBP2 and BRCA1 staining of ovarian tissues was performed. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase assays were carried out. The effect of the drugs 4-methylthio-2-oxobutyric acid (MTOB) and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor Olaparib on CtBP2 wild-type and knockdown cell lines was examined using methylthiazol tetrazolium assays and an xCELLigence System. RESULTS: Eighty-five genes involved in DNA repair, mitotic checkpoint, nucleosome assembly, and the BRCA1 network were differentially regulated by CtBP2 expression. ChIP and luciferase reporter assays using a BRCA1 promoter-regulated luciferase construct indicated that the CtBP2 complex binds the BRCA1 promoter and represses BRCA1 transcription. Immunohistochemistry illustrated a significant inverse CtBP2 and BRCA1 expression in a panel of malignant ovarian tumor tissues. The CtBP2 inhibitor MTOB suppressed ovarian cancer cell survival in a CtBP2-dependent manner. Ovarian cancer cells with CtBP2 knockdown did not display increased sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor Olaparib. CONCLUSION: CtBP2 is an ovarian cancer oncogene that may play a significant role in epigenetically silencing BRCA1 function in sporadic epithelial ovarian cancer. CtBP2-specific inhibitors, such as MTOB, may be effective adjunct therapies in the management of patients with CtBP2-positive ovarian carcinoma.",

     "abstract": "Tissue transglutaminase (TG2) is a multifunctional protein that binds to fibronectin and exerts protein transamidating activity in the presence of Ca2+. We previously reported that TG2 is upregulated in ovarian tumors and enhances intraperitoneal (i.p.) metastasis. TG2 is secreted abundantly in ovarian cancer (OC) ascites as an active enzyme, yet its function in the extracellular compartment remains unknown. To study the distinct functions of secreted TG2, we used recombinant His6-tagged TG2 and catalytically inactive enzyme in vitro and in vivo. By using i.p. and orthotopic ovarian xenografts, we show that extracellular transglutaminase promoted OC peritoneal metastasis. The main pathway activated by extracellular TG2 was noncanonical nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) signaling, and the enzymatic function of the protein was required to induce phosphorylation of I\u03baBkinase\u00e1 and processing of the precursor protein p100 into the active p52 subunit. A specific target of TG2-activated p52/RelB complex is the hyaluronan receptor, CD44. Noncanonical NF-\u03baB activation by extracellular TG2 induced CD44 up-regulation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, contributing to increased cancer cell invasiveness and OC peritoneal dissemination. Taken together, our data support that noncanonical NF-\u03baB activation is the pathway through which extracellular TG2 promotes OC metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV)-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) incidence is increasing at a near epidemic rate. We investigated whether the mammalian (or mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, rapamycin, can be used as a concurrent agent to standard-of-care cisplatin/radiation therapy (CRT) to attenuate tumor lactate production, thus enhancing CRT-induced immune-mediated clearance of this antigenic tumor type. A C57Bl/ 6-derived mouse oropharyngeal epithelial cell line retrovirally transduced with HPV type 16 E6/E7 and human squamous cell carcinoma cell lines were evaluated for their response to rapamycin in vitro with proliferation assays, Western blots, and lactate assays. Clonogenic assays and a preclinical mouse model were used to assess rapamycin as a concurrent agent to CRT. The potential of rapamycin to enhance immune response through lactate attenuation was assessed using quantitative tumor lactate bioluminescence and assessment of cell-mediated immunity using E6/E7-vaccinated mouse splenocytes. Rapamycin alone inhibited mTOR signaling of all cancer cell lines tested in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, rapamycin administered alone significantly prolonged survival in vivo but did not result in any long-term cures. Given concurrently, CRT/rapamycin significantly enhanced direct cell killing in clonogenic assays and prolonged survival in immunocompromised mice. However, in immunocompetent mice, concurrent CRT/rapamycin increased long-term cures by 21%. Preliminary findings suggest that improved survival involves increased cell killing and enhanced immune-mediated clearance in part due to decreased lactate production. The results may provide rationale for the clinical evaluation of mTOR inhibitors concurrent with standard-of-care CRT for treatment of HPV-positive HNSCC.",

Therefore, it became clear that efficient therapeutic regimens should also take into account the presence of these supportive cells and inhibit their paracrine effects. To this end, we tested the effect of low concentrations of curcumin, a pharmacologically safe natural product, on patient-derived primary breast CAF cells. We have shown that curcumin treatment upregulates p16INK4A and other tumor suppressor proteins while inactivates the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. This reduced the level of alpha-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and the migration/invasion abilities of these cells. Furthermore, curcumin suppressed the expression/secretion of stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9, and transforming growth factor-\u03b2, which impeded their paracrine procarcinogenic potential. Intriguingly, these effects were sustained even after curcumin withdrawal and cell splitting. Therefore, using different markers of senescence [senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) activity, Ki-67 and Lamin B1 levels, and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation], we have shown that curcumin markedly suppresses Lamin B1 and triggers DNA damage-independent senescence in proliferating but not quiescent breast stromal fibroblasts. Importantly, this curcumin-related senescence was p16INK4A-dependent and occurred with no associated inflammatory secretory phenotype. These results indicate the possible inactivation of cancer-associated myofibroblasts and present the first indication that curcumin can trigger DNA damage-independent and safe senescence in stromal fibroblasts.",

Metastasis development was strongly impaired in CCR1-deficient mice compared to control mice and was associated with reduced liver monocyte infiltration. To decipher the role of myeloid cells, sublethally irradiated mice were reconstituted with CCR1-deficient bone marrow (BM) and showed better survival rates than the control reconstituted mice. These results point toward the involvement of CCR1 myeloid cell infiltration in the promotion of tumor burden. In addition, survival rates were extended in CCR1-deficient mice receiving either control or CCR1-deficient BM, indicating that host CCR1 expression on nonhematopoietic cells also supports tumor growth. Finally, we found defective tumor-induced neoangiogenesis (in vitro and in vivo) in CCR1-deficient mice.

Furthermore, in a short series of fresh samples from human clear cell renal cell carcinoma, high levels of ERK5 correlate with more aggressive and metastatic stages of the disease.

We have recently demonstrated that NPM-ALK is physically associated with type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR). A positive feedback loop appears to exist between NPM-ALK and IGF-IR through which these two kinases interact to potentiate their effects. We have also found that a single mutation of the Tyr644 or Tyr664 residue of the C terminus of NPM-ALK to phenylalanine decreases significantly, but does not completely abolish, the association between NPM-ALK and IGF-IR. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the dual mutation of Tyr644 and Tyr664 abrogates the association and interactions between NPM-ALK and IGF-IR. We also examined the impact of this dual mutation on the oncogenic potential of NPM-ALK. Our results show that NPM-ALKY644,664F completely lacks association with IGF-IR. Importantly, we found that the dual mutation of Tyr644 and Tyr664 diminishes the oncogenic effects of NPM-ALK, including its ability to induce anchorage-independent colony formation and to sustain cellular transformation, proliferation, and migration.

They include inactivating mutations in Notch, p53, and p16ink4a tumor suppressor genes, in addition to nonoverlapping activating mutations of the PIK3CA and RAS oncogenes or inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. Notably, these genetic alterations, along with epigenetic changes, result in increased activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, which is present in most head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Moreover, we show here that approximately 30% of HNSCCs exhibit reduced PTEN expression. We challenged the biologic relevance of this finding by combining the intraoral administration of a tobacco surrogate, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, with a genetically defined animal model displaying reduced PTEN expression, achieved by the conditional deletion of Pten using the keratin promoter 14 CRE-lox system. This provided a specific genetic and environmentally defined animal model for HNSCC that resulted in the rapid development of oral-specific carcinomas. Under these experimental conditions, control mice did not develop HNSCC lesions. In contrast, most mice harboring Pten deficiency developed multiple SCC lesions in the lateral border and ventral part of the tongue and floor of the mouth, which are the preferred anatomic sites for human HNSCC. Overall, our study highlights the likely clinical relevance of reduced PTEN expression and/or inactivation in HNSCC progression, while the combined Pten deletion with exposure to tobacco carcinogens or their surrogates may provide a unique experimental model system to study novel molecular targeted treatments for HNSCC patients.",

Previously, we identified that Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 5 (KLF5), a key transcriptional regulator normally expressed in esophageal squamous epithelial cells, is lost in human ESCC. To examine the effects of restoring KLF5 in ESCC, we transduced the human ESCC cell lines TE7 and TE15, both of which lack KLF5 expression, with retrovirus to express KLF5 upon doxycycline induction. When KLF5 was induced, ESCC cells demonstrated increased apoptosis and decreased viability, with up-regulation of the proapoptotic factor BAX. Interestingly, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling, an important upstream mediator of proapoptotic pathways including BAX, was also activated following KLF5 induction. KLF5 activation of JNK signaling was mediated by KLF5 transactivation of two key upstream regulators of the JNK pathway, ASK1 and MKK4, and inhibition of JNK blocked apoptosis and normalized cell survival following KLF5 induction. Thus, restoring KLF5 in ESCC cells promotes apoptosis and decreases cell survival in a JNK-dependent manner, providing a potential therapeutic target for human ESCC.",

Molecular analyses of polyps suggested that GLAD exerts efficacy by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, decreasing \u03b2-catenin and caveolin-1 levels, increasing caspase-3 cleavage and p21, and modulating expression profile of inflammatory cytokines. These observations demonstrate that GLAD, a novel cocktail of chemopreventive agents at very low doses, suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis in APCMin/+ mice with no toxicity. This novel strategy to prevent colorectal cancer is an important step in developing agents with high efficacy without unwanted side effects.",

     "abstract": "Metabolomic profiling of prostate cancer (PCa) progression identified markedly elevated levels of sarcosine (N-methyl glycine) in metastatic PCa and modest but significant elevation of the metabolite in PCa urine. Here, we examine the role of key enzymes associated with sarcosine metabolism in PCa progression. Consistent with our earlier report, sarcosine levels were significantly elevated in PCa urine sediments compared to controls, with a modest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.71. In addition, the expression of sarcosine biosynthetic enzyme, glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), was elevated in PCa tissues, while sarcosine dehydrogenase (SARDH) and pipecolic acid oxidase (PIPOX), which metabolize sarcosine, were reduced in prostate tumors. Consistent with this, GNMT promoted the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by facilitating sarcosine production, while SARDH and PIPOX reduced the oncogenic potential of prostate cells by metabolizing sarcosine. Accordingly, addition of sarcosine, but not glycine or alanine, induced invasion and intravasation in an in vivo PCa model. In contrast, GNMT knockdown or SARDH overexpression in PCa xenografts inhibited tumor growth. Taken together, these studies substantiate the role of sarcosine in PCa progression.",

     "abstract": "Chronic sympathetic nervous system activation results in increased angiogenesis and tumor growth in orthotopic mouse models of ovarian carcinoma. However, the mechanistic effects of such activation on the tumor vasculature are not well understood. Dopamine (DA), an inhibitory catecholamine, regulates the functions of normal and abnormal blood vessels. Here, we examined whether DA, an inhibitory catecholamine, could block the effects of chronic stress on tumor vasculature and tumor growth. Exogenous administration of DA not only decreased tumor microvessel density but also increased pericyte coverage of tumor vessels following daily restraint stress in mice. Daily restraint stress resulted in significantly increased tumor growth in the SKOV3ip1 and HeyA8 ovarian cancer models. DA treatment blocked stress-mediated increases in tumor growth and increased pericyte coverage of tumor endothelial cells. Whereas the antiangiogenic effect of DA is mediated by dopamine receptor 2 (DR2), our data indicate that DA, through DR1, stimulates vessel stabilization by increasing pericyte recruitment to tumor endothelial cells. DA significantly stimulated migration of mouse 10T1/2 pericyte-like cells in vitro and increased cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) levels in these cells. Moreover, DA or the DR1 agonist SKF 82958 increased platinum concentration in SKOV3ip1 tumor xenografts following cisplatin administration. In conclusion, DA stabilizes tumor blood vessels through activation of pericyte cAMP-protein kinase A signaling pathway by DR1. These findings could have implications for blocking the stimulatory effects of chronic stress on tumor growth.",

Here, we investigated the epigenetic status of the BIM locus in NPM/ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines and in lymph node biopsies from NPM/ALK+ ALCL patients. We show that BIM is epigenetically silenced in cell lines and lymph node specimens and that treatment with the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A restores the histone acetylation, strongly upregulates BIM expression, and induces cell death. BIM silencing occurs through recruitment of MeCP2 and the SIN3a/histone deacetylase 1/2 (HDAC1/2) corepressor complex. This event requires BIM CpG methylation/demethylation with 5-azacytidine that leads to detachment of the MeCP2 corepressor complex and reacetylation of the histone tails. Treatment with the ALK inhibitor PF2341066 or with an inducible shRNA targeting NPM/ALK does not restore BIM locus reacetylation; however, enforced expression of NPM/ALK in an NPM/ALK-negative cell line significantly increases the methylation at the BIM locus. This study demonstrates that BIM is epigenetically silenced in NPM/ALK-positive cells through recruitment of the SIN3a/HDAC1/2 corepressor complex and that NPM/ALK is dispensable to maintain BIM epigenetic silencing but is able to act as an inducer of BIM methylation.",

Combined therapy of agents with different mechanisms of action is a feasible and effective means to minimize the side effects and avoid the resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs while improving the antitumor effects. As the most essential tumor suppressor, p53 or its pathway has been an attractive target to develop a new type of molecule-targeting anticancer therapy. Recently, we identified a small molecule, Inauhzin (INZ), which can specifically activate p53 by inducing its deacetylation. In this study, we tested if combination with INZ could sensitize tumor cells to the current chemotherapeutic drugs, cisplatin (CIS) and doxorubicin (DOX). We found that compared with any single treatment, combination of lower doses of INZ and CIS or DOX significantly promoted apoptosis and cell growth inhibition in human non-small lung cancer and colon cancer cell lines in a p53-dependent fashion. This cooperative effect between INZ and CIS on tumor suppression was also confirmed in a xenograft tumor model. Therefore, this study suggests that specifically targeting the p53 pathway could enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents and markedly reduce the doses of the chemotherapy, possibly decreasing its adverse side effects.",

We investigated if inhibiting SUR1 reduces cerebral edema due to metastases, the most common brain tumor, and explored the putative association of SUR1 and the endothelial tight junction protein, zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Nude rats were intracerebrally implanted with small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) LX1 or A2058 melanoma cells (n = 36). Rats were administered vehicle, glyburide (4.8 \u00b5g twice, orally), or dexamethasone (0.35 mg, intravenous). Blood-tumor barrier (BTB) permeability (Ktrans) was evaluated before and after treatment using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. SUR1 and ZO-1 expression was evaluated using immunofluorescence and Western blots. In both models, SUR1 expression was significantly increased (P < .05) in tumors. In animals with SCLC, control mean Ktrans (percent change \u00b1 standard error) was 101.8 \u00b1 36.6%, and both glyburide (-21.4 \u00b1 14.2%, P < .01) and dexamethasone (-14.2 \u00b1 13.1%, P < .01) decreased BTB permeability. In animals with melanoma, compared to controls (117.1 \u00b1 43.4%), glyburide lowered BTB permeability increase (3.2 \u00b1 15.4%, P < .05), while dexamethasone modestly lowered BTB permeability increase (63.1 \u00b1 22.1%, P > .05). Both glyburide (P < .001) and dexamethasone (P < .01) decreased ZO-1 gap formation.

Of the different members in the BCL-2 family, myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL-1) is commonly amplified in human tumors and is associated with their relapse and chemoresistance. As a result, specific inhibitors of MCL-1 are being designed to treat resistant tumors. However, there is increasing evidence for other nonapoptotic roles of the BCL-2 family, ranging from ionic homeostasis and autophagy to the regulation of fission-fusion dynamics in subcellular organelles, including the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In this study, we characterize the specificity of two novel putative MCL-1 inhibitors, BI97C1 (Sabutoclax) and BI112D1, in inducing apoptosis in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner and in an MCL-1-dependent system. In addition to their being proapoptotic, these inhibitors also cause enhanced mitochondrial fragmentation that accompanies a time-dependent loss of optic atrophy 1 (OPA1), suggesting an impairment of mitochondrial fusion. This mitochondrial fragmentation occurs independently of dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)-mediated fission activity and, unlike most apoptotic stimuli, occurs upstream of and/or independent of BAX, BAK, and other BH3-only proteins. Furthermore, this mitochondrial fragmentation occurred rapidly and preceded other hallmarks of apoptosis, including the loss in mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of cytochrome c. Although such mitochondrial fragmentation did not deplete total cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or alter other mitochondrial complexes, there was significant accumulation of reactive oxygen species.",

FAP digests extracellular matrix as tissue is remodeled during cancer expansion and may also promote an immunotolerant tumor microenvironment. Recent studies suggest that nonspecific FAP inhibitors suppress human cancer xenografts in mouse models. Prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), another prolyl-specific serine proteinase, is also elevated in many cancers and may have a regulatory role in angiogenesis promotion. FAP and POP cell-associated activities may be targets for diagnosis and treatment of various cancers, but their accessibilities to highly effective specific inhibitors have not been shown for cells important to cancer growth. Despite their frequent simultaneous expression in many cancers and their overlapping activities toward commonly used substrates, precise, separate measurement of FAP or POP activity has largely been ignored. To distinguish each of the two activities, we synthesized highly specific substrates and inhibitors for FAP or POP based on amino acid sequences surrounding the scissile bonds of their respective putative substrates. We found varying amounts of FAP and POP protein and activities on activated fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells, normal breast cells, and one breast cancer cell line, with some cells exhibiting more POP than FAP activity. Replicating endothelial cells (ECs) expressed POP but not FAP until tubulogenesis began. Targeting FAP-positive cells, especially mesenchymal stem cells and cancer-associated fibroblasts for inactivation or destruction, and inhibiting POP-producing EC may abrogate stromal invasion and angiogenesis simultaneously and thereby diminish cancer growth.",

Here, we investigated the specific genes downstream of MAPK-ERK2 responsible for the hyperproliferative abilities of human and murine primary ductal epithelial cells (PDCs) within an ECM. Compared with control, DNA synthesis and total cell proliferation was significantly increased in human PDCs harboring the PDAC common p53, Rb/p16INK4a, and K-RasG12D mutations. Both of these effects were readily reversed following small-molecule inhibition or lentiviral silencing of ERK2. Microarray analysis of PDCs in three-dimensional (3D) culture revealed a unique, MAPK-influenced gene signature downstream of K-RasG12D. Unbiased hierarchical analysis permitted filtration of tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1). Pancreatic cells isolated from Pdx1-Cre; LSL-K-rasG12D/+-mutated mice exhibit increased TIMP1 RNA transcription compared to wild-type littermate controls. Analyses of both 3D, in vitro human K-RasG12D PDCs and data mining of publicly annotated human pancreatic data sets correlatively indicate increased levels of TIMP1 RNA. While silencing TIMP1 did not significantly effect PDC proliferation, exogenous addition of human recombinant TIMP1 significantly increased proliferation but only in transformed K-RasG12D PDCs in 3D.

We integrated these data with RNA-seq and whole-genome DNA-seq data to comprehensively characterize the PCa methylome, detect changes associated with disease progression, and identify novel candidate prognostic biomarkers. Our analyses revealed the correlation of cytosine guanine dinucleotide island (CGI)-specific hypermethylation with disease severity and association of certain breakpoints (deletion, tandem duplications, and interchromosomal translocations) with DNA methylation. Furthermore, integrative analysis of methylation and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) uncovered widespread allele-specific methylation (ASM) for the first time in PCa. We found that most DNA methylation changes occurred in the context of ASM, suggesting that variations in tumor epigenetic landscape of individuals are partly mediated by genetic differences, which may affect PCa disease progression. We further selected a panel of 13 CGIs demonstrating increased DNA methylation with disease progression and validated this panel in an independent cohort of 20 benign prostate tissues, 16 PCa, and 8 aggressive CRPCs.

Here, we dissected MB cellular heterogeneity and directly compared invasion and self-renewal. Analysis of higher versus lower self-renewing tumor spheres and stationary versus migrating adherent MB cells revealed differential expression of the cell surface markers CD271 [p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR)] and CD133. Cell sorting demonstrated that CD271 selects for subpopulations with a higher capacity for self-renewal, whereas CD133 selects for cells exhibiting increased invasion in vitro. CD271 expression is higher in human fetal cerebellum and primary samples of the Shh MB molecular variant and lower in the more aggressive, invasive group 3 and 4 subgroups. Global gene expression analysis of higher versus lower self-renewing MB tumor spheres revealed down-regulation of a cell movement transcription program in the higher self-renewing state and a novel potential role for axon guidance signaling in MB-propagating cells. We have identified a cell surface signature based on CD133/CD271 expression that selects for MB cells with a higher self-renewal potential or invasive capacity in vitro. Our study underscores a previously unappreciated role for CD271 in selecting for MB cell phenotypes and suggests that successful treatment of pediatric brain tumors requires concomitant targeting of a spectrum of transitioning self-renewing and highly infiltrative cell subpopulations.",

Hypomethylation (87%) occurred more frequently than hypermethylation (13%). Several of the most significantly altered loci (CAV1, EVX1, MCF2L, and FGF1) were then used as probes to map the extent of these DNA methylation changes in normal tissues from prostates containing cancer. In TA tissues, the extent of methylation was similar both adjacent (2 mm) and at a distance (>1 cm) from tumor foci. These loci were also able to distinguish NTA from TA tissues in a validation set of patient samples.

Elevated expression of IL-1\u03b2 and cognate receptor IL-1R1 in ovarian cancer epithelial cells and CAFs independently predicted reduced overall patient survival, as did repressed nuclear p53 in ovarian CAFs. Knockdown of p53 expression in ovarian fibroblasts significantly enhanced the expression and secretion of chemokines IL-8, growth regulated oncogene-alpha (GRO-\u03b1), IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), significantly increased in vivo mouse xenograft ovarian cancer tumor growth, and was entirely dependent on interaction with, and transcriptional up-regulation of, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) p65. Our results have uncovered a previously unrecognized circuit whereby epithelial cancer cells use IL-1\u03b2 as a communication factor instructing stromal fibroblasts through p53 to generate a protumorigenic inflammatory microenvironment. Attenuation of p53 protein expression in stromal fibroblasts generates critical protumorigenic functionality, reminiscent of the role that oncogenic p53 mutations play in cancer cells.

Thus, \u03b3-catenin compensates for \u03b2-catenin loss at AJ without affecting desmosomes but is unable to fulfill functions in Wnt signaling. \u03b3-Catenin stabilization after \u03b2-catenin loss is brought about by PKA. Catenin-sensing mechanism may depend on absolute \u03b2-catenin levels and not its activity. Anti-\u03b2-catenin therapies for HCC affecting total \u03b2-catenin may target aberrant Wnt signaling without negatively impacting intercellular adhesion, provided mechanisms leading to \u03b3-catenin stabilization are spared.",

However, genotype-specific differences in expression have been emerging. Development of effective new therapies for distinctive manifestations, e.g., a high rate of malignancy in SDHB- or predisposition to multifocal PGLs in SDHD patients, mandates improved stratification. To identify mutation/location-related characteristics among pseudohypoxic PHEOs/PGLs, we used comprehensive microarray profiling (SDHB: n = 18, SDHD-abdominal/thoracic (AT): n = 6, SDHD-head/neck (HN): n = 8, VHL: n = 13). To avoid location-specific bias, typical adrenal medulla genes were derived from matched normal medullas and cortices (n = 8) for data normalization. Unsupervised analysis identified two dominant clusters, separating SDHB and SDHD-AT PHEOs/PGLs (cluster A) from VHL PHEOs and SDHD-HN PGLs (cluster B). Supervised analysis yielded 6937 highly predictive genes (misclassification error rate of 0.175). Enrichment analysis revealed that energy metabolism and inflammation/fibrosis-related genes were most pronouncedly changed in clusters A and B, respectively. A minimum subset of 40 classifiers was validated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction vs. microarray: r = 0.87). Expression of several individual classifiers was identified as characteristic for VHL and SDHD-HN PHEOs and PGLs. In the present study, we show for the first time that SDHD-HN PGLs share more features with VHL PHEOs than with SDHD-AT PGLs. The presented data suggest novel subclassification of pseudohypoxic PHEOs/PGLs and implies cluster-specific pathogenic mechanisms and treatment strategies.",

However, genetic determinants of PCA3 expression level remain unknown. To investigate the association between genetic variants and PCA3 mRNA level, a genome-wide association study was conducted in 1371 men of European descent in the REduction by DUtasteride of prostate Cancer Events trial. First-voided urine specimens containing prostate cells were obtained after digital rectal examination. The PROGENSA PCA3 assay was used to determine PCA3 score in the urinary samples. A linear regression model was used to detect the associations between (single nucleotide polymorphisms) SNPs and PCA3 score under an additive genetic model, adjusting for age and population stratification. Two SNPs, rs10993994 in \u03b2-microseminoprotein at 10q11.23 and rs10424878 in kallikrein-related peptidase 2 at 19q13.33, were associated with PCA3 score at genome-wide significance level (P = 1.22 x 10-9 and 1.06 x 10-8, respectively). Men carrying the rs10993994 \u201cT\u201d allele or rs10424878 \u201cA\u201d allele had higher PCA3 score compared with men carrying rs10993994 \u201cC\u201d allele or rs10424878 \u201cG\u201d allele (\u03b2 = 1.25 and 1.24, respectively).

Given its protection capacity against such relevant drugs as cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), gemcitabine, decitabine, or azacytidine and the highly hematopoiesis-specific toxicity profile of several of these agents, cytidine deaminase (CDD) represents another interesting candidate CTX-R gene and our group recently has established the myeloprotective capacity of CDD gene transfer in a number of murine transplant studies. Clinically, CDD overexpression appears particularly suited to optimize treatment strategies for acute leukemias and myelodysplasias given the efficacy of ara-C (and to a lesser degree decitabine and azacytidine) in these disease entities.

However, there is still relatively little known about how signals from the microenvironment contribute to the early events in the progression to malignancy. To address this question, we used a premalignant mammary model to examine how fibroblasts, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins they secrete, influence progression to malignancy. Their effect on metastatic malignant cells was also assessed for comparison. We found that carcinoma-associated fibroblasts, and the distinct aligned ECM they deposit, can cause both premalignant and malignant mammary epithelial cells to assume a mesenchymal morphology that is associated with increased dissemination and metastasis, while benign reduction mammoplasty fibroblasts favor the maintenance of an epithelial morphology and constrain early dissemination, tumor growth, and metastasis. Our results suggest that normalizing the organization of the ECM could be effective in limiting systemic dissemination and tumor growth.",

The presence of HMGA2 is correlated with advanced neoplastic disease and poor prognosis for patients. We had previously demonstrated a role of HMGA2 in DNA repair pathways. In the present study, we employed different human tumor cell models with endogenous and exogenous expression of HMGA2 and show that upon DNA damage, the presence of HMGA2 caused an increased and sustained phosphorylation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR) and its downstream target checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). The presence of activated pCHK1Ser296 coincided with prolonged G2/M block and increased tumor cell survival, which was enhanced further in the presence of HMGA2. Our study, thus, identifies a novel relationship between the ATR-CHK1 DNA damage response pathway and HMGA2, which may support the DNA repair function of HMGA2 in cancer cells. Furthermore, our data provide a rationale for the use of inhibitors to ATR or CHK1 and HMGA2 in the treatment of HMGA2-positive human cancer cells.",

We demonstrated this for exosomes of the metastatic rat adenocarcinoma BSp73ASML (ASML), which modulate draining lymph nodes and lung tissue to support settlement of poorly metastatic BSp73ASML-CD44v4-v7 knockdown (ASML-CD44vkd) cells. Now, we profiled mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) of ASMLwt and ASML-CD44vkd exosomes to define the pathway(s), whereby exosomes prepare the premetastatic niche. ASML exosomes, recovered in draining lymph nodes after subcutaneous injection, preferentially are taken up by lymph node stroma cells (LnStr) and lung fibroblasts (LuFb) that were chosen as exosome targets. ASMLwt and ASML-CD44vkd exosomes contain a restricted mRNA and miRNA repertoire that differs significantly between the two lines and exosomes thereof due to CD44v6 influencing gene and miRNA transcription/posttranscriptional regulation. Exosomal mRNA and miRNA are recovered in target cells, where transferred miRNA significantly affected mRNA translation. Besides others, this was exemplified for abundant ASMLwt-exosomal miR-494 and miR-542-3p, which target cadherin-17 (cdh17). Concomitantly, matrix metalloproteinase transcription, accompanying cdh17 down-regulation, was upregulated in LnStr transfected with miR-494 or miR-542-3p or co-cultured with tumor exosomes. Thus, tumor exosomes target non-transformed cells in premetastatic organs and modulate premetastatic organ cells predominantly through transferred miRNA, where miRNA from a metastasizing tumor prepares premetastatic organ stroma cells for tumor cell hosting. Fitting the demands of metastasizing tumor cells, transferred exosomal miRNA mostly affected proteases, adhesion molecules, chemokine ligands, cell cycle- and angiogenesis-promoting genes, and genes engaged in oxidative stress response. The demonstration of function-competent exosomal miRNA in host target cells encourages exploiting exosomes as a therapeutic gene delivery system.",

     "abstract": "The overexpression of AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is a frequent finding that has been associated with poor prognosis in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC). As the majority of EAC are intrinsically resistant to DNA-damaging therapies, an alternative therapeutic approach based on the activation of death receptors may be warranted. Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been evaluated in clinical trials and found promising as anticancer agent with mild side effects; unfortunately, resistance to TRAIL remains a major clinical problem. Herein, we explored the role of AXL in TRAIL resistance and elucidated the underlying mechanism. Overexpression of AXL in OE33 and OE19 cells promoted cell survival and attenuated TRAIL-induced cellular and molecular markers of apoptosis. In contrast, knockdown of endogenous AXL sensitized FLO-1 cells to TRAIL. The mechanism by which AXL regulates TRAIL resistance was examined. Protein and mRNA expression of DR4 and DR5 death receptors was not downregulated by AXL. In addition, the possible involvement of FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) in regulating the interaction of caspase-8 with Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) was excluded, as AXL did not enhance FLIP expression or FLIP/FADD association. Alternatively, protein association of AXL with DR5, independent of TRAIL, was confirmed, suggesting that AXL could regulate DR5 receptor activity. The AXL/DR5 association had no negative effect on TRAIL-induced interaction with FADD. However, the AXL/DR5 interaction blocked the recruitment of caspase-8 to the death-inducing signal complex (DISC). Collectively, our findings uncover a novel mechanism of TRAIL resistance mediated by AXL through regulation of the DISC and provide strong evidence that AXL could be exploited as a therapeutic target to circumvent TRAIL resistance.",

Noteworthy, melanoma cells in vivo exhibit markedly increased autophagy, as response to expression of bcl-2 protein deleted of its BH4 domain. This observation led to the identification of a novel gain of function for bcl-2 protein lacking the BH4 domain. In particular, upon different autophagic stimuli in vitro, overexpression of bcl-2 protein deleted of BH4 domain induces autophagosome accumulation, conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B-II, reduced expression of p62/SQSTM1 protein, and thereby enhanced autophagic flux. The relevance of Beclin-1 is evidenced by the fact that 1) the autophagy-promoting and growth-inhibiting properties are partially rescued by Beclin-1 knockdown in cells expressing bcl-2 protein lacking the BH4 domain, 2) Beclin-1 only interacts with wild-type but not with deleted bcl-2, and 3) BH4 domain removal from bcl-2 protein does not influence in vitro and in vivo growth of tumor cells expressing low levels of endogenous Beclin-1.

Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs) mediate cellular responses during normal development and are central in the adaptation to oxygen shortage. HIFs are also implicated in the progression of several cancer forms, and high HIF-2\u03b1 expression correlates with disseminated disease and poor outcome in neuroblastoma. During normal SNS development, HIF2A is transiently expressed in neuroblasts and chromaffin cells. SNS cells can, during development, be distinguished by distinct gene expression patterns, and insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is a marker of sympathetic chromaffin cells, whereas sympathetic neuroblasts lack IGF2 expression. Despite the neuronal derivation of neuroblastomas, we show that neuroblastoma cell lines and specimens express IGF2 and that expression of HIF2A and IGF2 correlates, with the strongest correlation in high-stage tumors. In neuroblastoma, both IGF2 and HIF2A are hypoxia-driven and knocking down IGF2 at hypoxia resulted in downregulated HIF2A levels. HIF-2\u03b1 and IGF2 were strongly expressed in subsets of immature neuroblastoma cells, suggesting that these two genes could be co-expressed also at early stages of SNS development. We show that IGF2 is indeed expressed in sympathetic chain ganglia at embryonic week 6.5, a developmental stage when HIF-2\u03b1 is present. These findings provide a rationale for the unexpected IGF2 expression in neuroblastomas and might suggest that IGF2 and HIF2A positive neuroblastoma cells are arrested at an embryonic differentiation stage corresponding to the stage when sympathetic chain ganglia begins to coalesce.",

The fully human H4B-121 Ab and the mouse monoclonal Abs 16D3-C1 and 9F7-F11 inhibited tumor growth in nude mice xenografted with epidermoid, pancreatic, or triple-negative breast cancer cells.

We report that a 14-amino acid peptide derived from transmembrane protein 45A shows multimodal inhibition of lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis in breast cancer. The peptide blocks lymphangiogenic and angiogenic phenotypes of lymphatic and blood endothelial cells induced by tumor-conditioned media prepared from MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.

     "abstract": "Background Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted agents have demonstrated clinical benefit in patients with cancer. Identifying tissue-of-origin-independent predictive biomarkers is important to optimally treat patients. We sought to identify a gene array profile that could predict responsiveness to panitumumab, a fully human EGFR-binding antibody, using preclinical models of human cancer.Methods Mice bearing 25 different xenograft models were treated twice weekly with panitumumab or immunoglobulin G2 control to determine their responsiveness to panitumumab. Samples from these xenografts and untreated xenografts were arrayed on the Affymetrix human U133A gene chip to identify gene sets predicting responsiveness to panitumumab using univariate and multivariate analyses. The predictive models were validated using the leave-one-group-out (LOO) method.Results Of the 25 xenograft models tested, 12 were responsive and 13 were resistant to panitumumab. Unsupervised analysis demonstrated that the xenograft models clustered by tissue type rather than responsiveness to panitumumab. After normalizing for tissue effects, samples clustered by responsiveness using an unsupervised multidimensional scaling. A multivariate selection algorithm was used to select 13 genes that could stratify xenograft models based on responsiveness after adjustment for tissue effects. The method was validated using the LOO method on a training set of 22 models and confirmed independently on three new models. In contrast, a univariate gene selection method resulted in higher misclassification rates.Conclusion A model was constructed from microarray data that prospectively predict responsiveness to panitumumab in xenograft models. This approach may help identify patients, independent of disease origin, likely to benefit from panitumumab.",

Activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and human EGFR2 (HER2) is observed frequent in pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Because of co-activation of these two signaling pathways, we assessed the efficacy of inhibition of EGFR/HER2 receptors and the downstream KRAS effector, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal regulated kinase (ERK) kinase 1 and 2 (MEK1/2), on pancreatic cancer proliferation in vitro and in a murine orthotopic xenograft model. Treatment of established and patient-derived pancreatic cancer cell lines with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib (GSK1120212) inhibited proliferation, and addition of the EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib enhanced the inhibition elicited by trametinib in three of eight cell lines. Importantly, in the orthotopic xenograft model, treatment with lapatinib and trametinib resulted in significantly enhanced inhibition of tumor growth relative to trametinib treatment alone in four of five patient-derived tumors tested and was, in all cases, significantly more effective in reducing the size of established tumors than treatment with lapatinib or trametinib alone. Acute treatment of established tumors with trametinib resulted in an increase in AKT2 phosphorylation that was blunted in mice treated with both trametinib and lapatinib. These data indicate that inhibition of the EGFR family receptor signaling may contribute to the effectiveness of MEK1/2 inhibition of tumor growth possibly through the inhibition of feedback activation of receptor tyrosine kinases in response to inhibition of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway. These studies provide a rationale for assessing the co-inhibition of these pathways in the treatment of pancreatic cancer patients.",

In a panel of human cancer and transformed cell lines representing the two known types of genomic instability (chromosomal and microsatellite), as well as the two known pathways of telomere maintenance in cancer (telomerase activity and alternative lengthening of telomeres), telomere dysfunction-driven polyploidization occurred independently of the mutational status of p53. Depending on the preexisting context of telomere maintenance, telomerase activity and its major components, human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and human telomerase RNA component (hTERC), exert both reverse transcriptase-related (canonical) and noncanonical functions to affect tumor genome evolution through suppression or induction of polyploidization.

After backcrossing our previously described furin and PACE4 transgenic lines, targeted to the epidermis, into a SKH-1 background, we exposed both single and double transgenic mice to UV radiation for 34 weeks.

Targeting both furin and PACE4 to the epidermis in double transgenic mice did not have an additive effect on tumor incidence/multiplicity but did enhance the tumor histopathologic grade, i.e., a significant increase in higher grade SCCs was seen in the bigenic mouse line SPF47 (P < .02).

Here, we used in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to assess expression of miR-200 and EMT biomarkers in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded human colorectal adenocarcinomas. In addition, laser capture microdissection and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were employed to quantify levels of miR-200 in the normal epithelium, tumor core, invasive front, and stroma. We find that miR-200 is downregulated at the invasive front of colorectal adenocarcinomas that have destroyed and invaded beyond the basement membrane. However, regional lymph node metastases and vascular carcinoma deposits show strong expression of miR-200, suggesting this family of miRNAs is involved in the recapitulation of the primary tumor phenotype at metastatic sites. In contrast, adenomas and adenocarcinomas with intact basement membranes showed uniform miR-200 expression from the tumor core to the tumor-host interface. Taken together, these data support the involvement of EMT and mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) in the metastasis cascade and show that miR-200 is downregulated in the initial stages of stromal invasion but is restored at metastatic sites.",

     "abstract": "Our previous studies have shown the role of radiation-induced urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) expression in the progression of meningioma. In the present study, we investigated whether modulation of DNA methylation profiles could regulate uPA expression. Initially, radiation treatment was found to induce hypomethylation in meningioma cells with a decrease in DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and methyl-CpG binding domain protein (MBD) expression. However, oxidative damage by H2O2 or pretreatment of irradiated cells with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) did not show any influence on these proteins, thereby indicating a radiation-specific change in the methylation patterns among meningioma cells. Further, we identified that hypomethylation is coupled to an increase in uPA expression in these cells. Azacytidine treatment induced a dose-dependent surge of uPA expression, whereas pre-treatment with sodium butyrate inhibited radiation-induced uPA expression, which complemented our prior results. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction on bisulfite-treated genomic DNA revealed a diminished methylation of uPA promoter in irradiated cells. Transfection with small hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing plasmids targeting CpG islands of the uPA promoter showed a marked decline in uPA expression with subsequent decrease in invasion and proliferation of meningioma cells. Further, radiation treatment was found to recruit SP1 transcription factor, which was abrogated by shRNA treatment. Analysis on signaling events demonstrated the activation of MAP kinase kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in radiation-treated cells, while U0126 (MEK/ERK inhibitor) blocked hypomethylation, recruitment of SP1, and uPA expression. In agreement with our in vitro data, low DNMT1 levels and high uPA were found in intracranial tumors treated with radiation compared to untreated tumors. In conclusion, our data suggest that radiation-mediated hypomethylation triggers uPA expression in meningioma cells.",

Little is known about PDGFRB signaling in colorectal tumor cells. We studied the relationship between PDGFRB expression, EMT, and metastasis in human colorectal cancer (CRC) cohorts by analysis of gene expression profiles. PDGFRB expression in primary CRC was correlated with short disease-free and overall survival. PDGFRB was co-expressed with genes involved in platelet activation, transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) signaling, and EMT in three CRC cohorts. PDGFRB was expressed in mesenchymal-like tumor cell lines in vitro and stimulated invasion and liver metastasis formation in mice. Platelets, a major source of PDGF, preferentially bound to tumor cells in a non-activated state. Platelet activation caused robust PDGFRB tyrosine phosphorylation on tumor cells in vitro and in liver sinusoids in vivo. Platelets also release TGFB, which is a potent inducer of EMT. Inhibition of TGFB signaling in tumor cells caused partial reversion of the mesenchymal phenotype and strongly reduced PDGFRB expression and PDGF-stimulated tumor cell invasion. These results suggest that PDGFRB may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of colorectal tumors with mesenchymal properties, most likely downstream of platelet activation and TGFB signaling.",

AURKA amplification was identified in overall 65% of PCAs (hormone na\u00efve and treated) from patients that developed t-NEPC and in 86% of metastases. Concurrent amplification of MYCN was present in 70% of primary PCAs, 69% of treated PCAs, and 83% of metastases. In contrast, in an unselected PCA cohort, AURKA and MYCN amplifications were identified in only 5% of 169 cases. When metastatic t-NEPC was compared to primary PCA from the same patients, there was 100% concordance of ERG rearrangement, 100% concordance of AURKA amplification, and 60% concordance of MYCN amplification. In tumors with mixed features, there was also 100% concordance of ERG rearrangement and 94% concordance of AURKA and MYCN co-amplification between areas of NEPC and adenocarcinoma.

Using transcriptional profiling, we previously identified WNT5A as target of the antiapoptotic transcription factor CUX1 and demonstrated high expression levels in pancreatic cancer. However, the impact of WNT5A on drug resistance and the signaling pathways employed by WNT5A remain to be elucidated.OBJECTIVES: This project aims to decipher the impact of WNT5A on resistance to apoptosis and the signaling pathways employed by WNT5A in pancreatic cancer.METHODS: The impact of WNT5A and its downstream effectors on tumor growth and drug resistance was studied in vitro and in xenograft models in vivo. Tissue microarrays of pancreatic cancer specimens were employed for immuno-histochemical studies.RESULTS: Knockdown of WNT5A results in a significant increase in drug-induced apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of WNT5A or addition of recombinant WNT5A mediates resistance to apoptosis in vitro. In our attempt to identify downstream effectors of WNT5A, we identified the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 (NFATc2) as transcriptional target of WNT5A signaling. NFATc2 confers a strong antiapoptotic phenotype mediating at least in part the effects of WNT5A on drug resistance and tumor cell survival. In vivo, WNT5A expression leads to resistance to gemcitabine-induced apoptosis in a xenograft model, which is paralleled by up-regulation of NFATc2.

     "abstract": "The molecular effects of obesity are mediated by alterations in the levels of adipocytokines. High leptin level associated with obese state is a major cause of breast cancer progression and metastasis, whereas adiponectin is considered a \u201cguardian angel adipocytokine\u201d for its protective role against various obesity-related pathogenesis including breast cancer. In the present study, investigating the role of adiponectin as a potential inhibitor of leptin, we show that adiponectin treatment inhibits leptin-induced clonogenicity and anchorage-independent growth. Leptin-stimulated migration and invasion of breast cancer cells is also effectively inhibited by adiponectin. Analyses of the underlying molecular mechanisms reveal that adiponectin suppresses activation of two canonical signaling molecules of leptin signaling axis: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt. Pretreatment of breast cancer cells with adiponectin protects against leptin-induced activation of ERK and Akt. Adiponectin increases expression and activity of the physiological inhibitor of leptin signaling, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), which is found to be integral to leptin-antagonist function of adiponectin. Inhibition of PTP1B blocks adiponectin-mediated inhibition of leptin-induced breast cancer growth. Our in vivo studies show that adenovirus-mediated adiponectin treatment substantially reduces leptin-induced mammary tumorigenesis in nude mice. Exploring therapeutic strategies, we demonstrate that treatment of breast cancer cells with rosiglitazone results in increased adiponectin expression and inhibition of migration and invasion. Rosiglitazone treatment also inhibits leptin-induced growth of breast cancer cells. Taken together, these data show that adiponectin treatment can inhibit the oncogenic actions of leptin through blocking its downstream signaling molecules and raising adiponectin levels could be a rational therapeutic strategy for breast carcinoma in obese patients with high leptin levels.",

To understand the molecular mechanisms, we performed a yeast two-hybrid analysis and identified mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue 1 (MALT1) as an HECTD3-interacting protein. HECTD3 promotes MALT1 ubiquitination with non-degradative polyubiquitin chains by direct interacting with the MALT1 through its N-terminal destruction of cyclin domain. HECTD3 does not target MALT1 for degradation but stabilize it. HECTD3 depletion dramatically decreases the levels of MALT1 in MCF7 and HeLa cells treated with cisplatin, which is correlated to an increase in apoptosis. Knockdown of MALT1 likewise increases cisplatin-induced apoptosis in these cancer cells. However, HECTD3 overexpression leads to a decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis, whereas overexpression of MALT1 partially rescues HECTD3 depletion\u2013induced apoptosis.

Bcl-2 overexpression also significantly potentiated in vivo efficacy of paclitaxel, in terms of tumor volume decrease and survival benefits, in models of nude mice bearing lung cancer xenografts. To further investigate this favorable effect of Bcl-2, a genomic approach was taken. It revealed that Bcl-2 overexpression induced up-regulation of the proapoptotic protein Bim in lung cancer cells and that, conversely, Bcl-2 silencing decreased Bim expression level. A gene regulation study implicated the transcription factor Forkhead box-containing protein, class O3a in Bim up-regulation.

     "abstract": "Overcoming the emergence of acquired resistance to clinically approved epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors is a major challenge in the treatment of advanced non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a series of novel compounds affecting viability of NSCLC NCI-H1975 cells (carrying the EGFR T790M mutation). The inhibition of the autophosphorylation of EGFR occurred at nanomolar concentrations and both UPR1282 and UPR1268 caused a significant induction of apoptosis. Targeting of EGFR and downstream pathways was confirmed by a peptide substrate array, which highlighted the inhibition of other kinases involved in NSCLC cell aggressive behavior. Accordingly, the drugs inhibited migration (about 30% vs. control), which could be, in part, explained also by the increase of E-cadherin expression. Additionally, we observed a contraction of the volume of H1975 spheroids, associated with the reduction of the cancer stem\u2013like cell hallmark CD133. The activity of UPR1282 was retained in H1975 xenograft models where it determined tumor shrinkage (P < .05) and resulted well tolerated compared to canertinib. Of note, the kinase activity profile of UPR1282 on xenograft tumor tissues showed overlapping results with respect to the activity in H1975 cells, unraveling the inhibition of kinases involved in pivotal proliferation and invasive signaling pathways. In conclusion, UPR1282 and UPR1268 are effective against various processes involved in malignancy transformation and progression and may be promising compounds for the future treatment of gefitinib-resistant NSCLCs.",

The mechanisms underlying elevated hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) production in GBM are not understood. We found higher, coordinated mRNA expression levels of HGF and c-Met in mesenchymal (Mes) GBMs, a subtype associated with poor treatment response and shorter overall survival. In an HGF/c-Met\u2013dependent GBM cell line, HGF expression declined upon silencing of c-Met using RNAi or by inhibiting its activity with SU11274. Silencing c-Met decreased anchorage-independent colony formation and increased the survival of mice bearing intracranial GBM xenografts. Consistent with these findings, c-Met activation by \u0394EGFR also elevated HGF expression, and the inhibition of \u0394EGFR with AG1478 reduced HGF levels. Interestingly, c-Met expression was required for \u0394EGFR-mediated HGF production, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo tumorigenicity, suggesting that these pathways are coupled. Using an unbiased mass spectrometry\u2013based screen, we show that signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) Y705 is a downstream target of c-Met signaling. Suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation with WP1193 reduced HGF expression in \u0394EGFR-expressing GBM cells, whereas constitutively active STAT3 partially rescued HGF expression and colony formation in c-Met knockdown cells expressing \u0394EGFR. These results suggest that the c-Met/HGF signaling axis is enhanced by \u0394EGFR through increased STAT3-dependent HGF expression and that targeting c-Met in Mes GBMs may be an important strategy for therapy.",

Antigen-presenting cells such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and tumor dendritic cells (TuDCs) are the main protagonists of tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) immuno-suppression. TAMs have been widely investigated and are associated with poor prognosis, but the immuno-suppressive activity of TuDCs is less well understood. We performed two-photon imaging of the tumor tissue to examine the spatiotemporal interactions between TILs and TuDCs after chemotherapy. In a strongly immuno-suppressive murine tumor model, cyclophosphamide-mediated chemotherapy transiently enhanced the antitumor activity of adoptively transferred ovalbumin-specific CD8+ T cell receptor transgenic T cells (OTI) but barely affected TuDC compartment within the tumor. Time lapse imaging of living tumor tissue showed that TuDCs are organized as a mesh with dynamic interconnections. Once infiltrated into the tumor parenchyma, OTI T cells make antigen-specific and long-lasting contacts with TuDCs. Extensive analysis of TIL infiltration on histologic section revealed that after chemotherapy the majority of OTI T cells interact with TuDCs and that infiltration is restricted to TuDC-rich areas. We propose that the TuDC network exerts antigen-dependent unproductive retention that trap T cells and limit their antitumor effectiveness.",

A previous analysis of colorectal tumors revealed that overexpression of splice variant Rac1b occurs in around 80% of tumors with mutant BRAF and both events proved to cooperate in tumor cell survival. Here, we provide evidence for increased expression of Rac1b in patients with inflamed human colonic mucosa as well as following experimentally induced colitis in mice. The increase of Rac1b in the mouse model was specifically prevented by the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen, which also inhibited Rac1b expression in cultured HT29 colorectal tumor cells through a cyclooxygenase inhibition\u2013independent mechanism. Accordingly, the presence of ibuprofen led to a reduction of HT29 cell survival in vitro and inhibited Rac1b-dependent tumor growth of HT29 xenografts. Together, our results suggest that stromal cues, namely, inflammation, can trigger changes in Rac1b expression in the colon and identify ibuprofen as a highly specific and efficient inhibitor of Rac1b overexpression in colorectal tumors. Our data suggest that the use of ibuprofen may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with serrated colorectal tumors or with inflammatory colon syndromes.",

It serves as a negative regulator of p53 and thereby limits cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Because MDM2 blockade suppresses tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo, respective MDM2 inhibition is currently evaluated as anti-cancer therapy in clinical trials. However, the anti-proliferative effects of MDM2 inhibition also impair regenerative cell growth upon tissue injury. This was so far documented for tubular repair upon postischemic acute kidney injury and might apply to wound healing responses in general. Furthermore, MDM2 has numerous p53-independent effects. As a new entry, MDM2 was identified to act as a co-transcription factor for nuclear factor-kappa-light-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB) at cytokine promoters. This explains the potent anti-inflammatory effects of MDM2 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. For example, the NF-\u03baB-antagonistic and p53-agonistic activities of MDM2 inhibitors elicit potent therapeutic effects on experimental lymphoproliferative autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus. In this review, we discuss the classic p53-dependent, the recently discovered p53-independent, and the NF-\u03baB-agonistic biologic functions of MDM2. We describe its complex regulatory role on p53 and NF-\u03baB signaling and name areas of research that may help to foresee previously unexpected effects or potential alternative indications of therapeutic MDM2 blockade.",

     "abstract": "Smoking is a significant risk factor for pancreatic cancer, but the molecular mechanisms by which tobacco smoke components promote the growth and progression of these cancers are not fully understood. While nicotine, the addictive component of tobacco smoke, is not a carcinogen, it has been shown to promote the growth of non-small cell lung and pancreatic cancers in a receptor-dependent fashion. Here, we show that stimulation of pancreatic cancer cells with nicotine concentrations that are within the range of human exposure results in activation of Src kinase, which facilitated the induction of the inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1) transcription factor. Depletion of Id1 prevented nicotine-mediated induction of proliferation and invasion of pancreatic cancer cells, indicating that it is a major mediator of nicotine function. Nicotine could promote the growth and metastasis of pancreatic cancers orthotopically implanted into SCID mice; in addition, cells stably expressing a short hairpin RNA for Id1 did not grow or metastasize in response to nicotine. Nicotine could also confer resistance to apoptosis induced by gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells in vitro and depletion of Src or Id1 rendered the cells sensitive to gemcitabine. Further, nicotine could effectively inhibit the chemotherapeutic effects of gemcitabine on pancreatic tumors xenografted into mice. Clinical analyses of resected pancreatic cancer specimens demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between Id1 expression and phospho-Src, tumor grade/differentiation, and worsening overall patient survival. These results demonstrate that exposure to tobacco smoke components might promote pancreatic cancer progression, metastasis, and chemoresistance and highlight the role of Id1 in these processes.",

     "publication date": "12-2012",
     "abstract": "Promising phase II clinical results have been reported recently for several oncolytic viral therapeutics, including strains based on vaccinia virus. One reason for this has been an increased appreciation of the critical therapeutic importance of the immune response raised by these viruses. However, the most commonly used approaches to enhance these immunotherapeutic effects in oncolytic viruses, typically though expression of cytokine transgenes, often also result in a reduction in oncolytic activity and premature clearance of the virotherapy from the tumor. Approaches that enhance the immunotherapeutic effects while maintaining oncolytic activity would therefore be beneficial. Here, it is demonstrated that the expression of the chemokine CCL19 (ELC) from an oncolytic vaccinia virus (vvCCL19) results in increased antitumor effects in syngeneic mouse tumor models. This corresponded with increased t cell and dendritic cell infiltration into the tumor. However, vvCCL19 persisted in the tumor at equivalent levels to a control virus without CCL19, demonstrating that oncolytic activity was not curtailed. Instead, vvCCL19 was cleared rapidly and selectively from normal tissues and organs, indicating a potentially increased safety profile. The therapeutic activity of vvCCL19 could be further significantly increased through combination with adoptive transfer of therapeutic immune cells expressing CCR7, the receptor for CCL19. This approach therefore represents a means to increase the safety and therapeutic benefit of oncolytic viruses, used alone or in combination with immune cell therapies.",

     "abstract": "High circulating cholesterol is associated with hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, and stroke. However, the relation between cholesterol and tumorigenesis/metastasis is controversial. The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) regulates low-density lipoprotein cholesterol homeostasis by targeting the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) for degradation. PCSK9 is mostly expressed in liver, which is one of the most common sites for metastatic disease. To reveal the function of PCSK9 and also evaluate the impact of cholesterol in liver metastasis development, B16F1 melanoma cells were injected into wild-type (WT) and Pcsk9-/- mice to induce liver metastasis. On chow diet, Pcsk9-/- mice harbored two-fold less liver metastases than WT mice. This decrease is related to low cholesterol levels in Pcsk9-/- mice, as the protection was lost after normalizing Pcsk9-/- cholesterol levels by a 2-week high cholesterol diet. Furthermore, a prolongation of this diet strongly increased metastasis in both genotypes, suggesting that high cholesterol levels promote metastatic progression. The protective effect of the PCSK9 deficiency is also associated with increased apoptosis in liver stroma and metastases. Tumor necrosis factor.\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) mRNA and protein were, respectively, higher in liver stroma and plasma of injected mice, likely increasing the apoptotic TNF\u03b1 signaling. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic factor B-cell lymphoma 2 was downregulated. TNF\u03b1 regulation is LDLR-independent, as its mRNA level was similarly upregulated in mice lacking both PCSK9 and LDLR. Our findings show that PCSK9 deficiency reduces liver metastasis by its ability to lower cholesterol levels and by possibly enhancing TNF\u03b1-mediated apoptosis.",

We assessed dasatinib survival benefit on the basis of measured tumor volumes. Using brain tumor cells derived from PDGFB-driven gliomas, dose-dependent uptake and time-dependent inhibitory effects of F-SKI249380 on biologic activity were investigated and compared with the parent drug. PDGFR receptor status and tumor-specific targeting were non-invasively evaluated in vivo using 18F-SKI249380 and 18F-SKI249380-containing micellar and liposomal nanoformulations. A statistically significant survival benefit was found using dasatinib (95 mg/kg) versus saline vehicle (P < .001) in tumor volume-matched GEMM pairs. Competitive binding and treatment assays revealed comparable biologic properties for F-SKI249380 and the parent drug. In vivo, Significantly higher tumor uptake was observed for 18F-SKI249380-containing micelle formulations [4.9 percentage of the injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g); P = .002] compared to control values (1.6%ID/g). Saturation studies using excess cold dasatinib showed marked reduction of tumor uptake values to levels in normal brain (1.5%ID/g), consistent with in vivo binding specificity. Using 18F-SKI249380-containing micelles as radiotracers to estimate therapeutic dosing requirements, we calculated intratumoral drug concentrations (24\u201360 nM) that were comparable to in vitro 50% inhibitory concentration values. 18F-SKI249380 is a PDGFR-selective tracer, which demonstrates improved delivery to PDGFB-driven high-grade gliomas and facilitates treatment planning when coupled with nanoformulations and quantitative PET imaging approaches.",

Forty-four patients with RCC were recruited into this observational prospective study conducted in nine Spanish institutions. Peripheral blood samples were taken before initiation of therapy and 14 days later in patients receiving first-line therapy with sunitinib for advanced RCC. miRNA expression in peripheral blood was assessed using microarrays and L2 boosting was applied to filtered miRNA expression data. Several models predicting poor and prolonged response to sunitinib were constructed and evaluated by binary logistic regression. Blood samples from 38 patients and 287 miRNAs were evaluated. Twenty-eight miRNAs of the 287 were related to poor response and 23 of the 287 were related to prolonged response to sunitinib treatment. Predictive models identified populations with differences in the established end points. In the poor response group, median time to progression was 3.5 months and the overall survival was 8.5, whereas in the prolonged response group these values were 24 and 29.5 months, respectively. Ontology analyses pointed out to cancer-related pathways, such angiogenesis and apoptosis. miRNA expression signatures, measured in peripheral blood, may stratify patients with advanced RCC according to their response to first-line therapy with sunitinib, improving diagnostic accuracy. After proper validation, these signatures could be used to tailor therapy in this setting.",

Few embryonal histology markers that yield insight into the biologic basis for this prognostic discrepancy exist. CBP/P-300 interacting transactivator 1 (CITED1), a transcriptional co-activator, is expressed in the self-renewing nephron progenitor population of the developing kidney and broadly in its malignant analog, Wilms tumor (WT). In this current study, CITED1 expression is detected in mouse embryonic liver initially on post-coitum day 10.5 (e10.5), begins to taper by e14.5, and is undetectable in e18.5 and adult livers. CITED1 expression is detected in regenerating murine hepatocytes following liver injury by partial hepatectomy and 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine. Importantly, while CITED1 is undetectable in normal human adult livers, 36 of 41 (87.8%) hepatoblastoma specimens express CITED1, where it is enriched in EMEF specimens compared to specimens of pure fetal histology. CITED1 overexpression in Hep293TT human hepatoblastoma cells induces cellular proliferation and upregulates the Wnt inhibitors Kringle containing transmembrane protein 1 (KREMEN1) and CXXC finger protein 4 (CXXC4). CITED1 mRNA expression correlates with expression of CXXC4 and KREMEN1 in clinical hepatoblastoma specimens. These data show that CITED1 is expressed during a defined time course of liver development and is no longer expressed in the adult liver but is upregulated in regenerating hepatocytes following liver injury. Moreover, as in WT, this embryonic marker is reexpressed in hepatoblastoma and correlates with embryonal histology. These findings identify CITED1 as a novel marker of hepatic progenitor cells that is re-expressed following liver injury and in embryonic liver tumors.",

Postnatal inactivation of E-cadherin affected Clara cell differentiation and compromised airway regeneration under injury conditions. In steady-state adult lung, overexpression of the dominant negative E-cadherin led to an expansion of the bronchiolar stem cells and decreased differentiation concomitant with canonical Wnt signaling activation. Expansion of the bronchiolar stem cell pool was associated with an incessant proliferation of neuroepithelial body.associated Clara cells that ultimately gave rise to bronchiolar hyperplasia. Despite progressive hyperplasia, only a minority of the mice developed pulmonary solid tumors, suggesting that the loss of E-cadherin function leads to tumor formation when additional mutations are sustained. The present study reveals that E-cadherin plays a critical role in the regulation of proliferation and homeostasis of the epithelial cells lining the conducting airways.",

In this study, we tested the effect of valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, on the expression of NKG2D ligands in myeloma cells. We demonstrated that VPA was able to upregulate both protein and mRNA expression of major histocompatibility complex class I-related chain (MIC) A/B and UL16-binding protein (ULBP) 2 without any significant effect on the expression of ULBP1, ULBP3, and ULBP4 or induction of other natural killer (NK) cell ligands, such as NKp30-L, NKp44-L, and NKp46-L in myeloma cells. A 51Cr release assay and degranulation assay indicated that the induction of MICA/B and ULBP2 augmented NK cell-mediated lysis of myeloma cells, which was abolished by the addition of a blocking NKG2D antibody. Activation of constitutively phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) by VPA is essential for the up-regulation of MICA/B and ULBP2 expressions. Inhibition of ERK using ERK inhibitor PD98059 decreased both MICA/B and ULBP2 expressions and NK cell cytotoxicity. Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active ERK in ARK resulted in increased MICA/B and ULBP2 expressions and enhanced NK cell lysis. These data indicate that increased sensitivity of VPA-treated myeloma cells to NK cell lysis is caused by higher NKG2D ligand expression, resulting from more active ERK signaling pathway. Our results provide evidence that targeting ERK signaling pathway may be an additional mechanism supporting the antimyeloma activity of HDAC inhibitors and suggest its possible immunotherapeutic value for myeloma treatment.",

Overexpression of c-Myc also enhances DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), genetic instability, and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanism(s) involved remains elusive. Here, we discovered that \u03b3-ray ionizing radiation-induced DSBs promote c-Myc to form foci and to co-localize with \u03b3-H2AX. Conditional expression of c-Myc in HO15.19 c-Myc null cells using the Tet-Off/Tet-On inducible system results in down-regulation of Ku DNA binding and suppressed activities of DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) and DNA end-joining, leading to inhibition of DSB repair and enhanced chromosomal and chromatid breaks. Expression of c-Myc reduces both signal and coding joins with decreased fidelity during V(D)J recombination. Mechanistically, c-Myc directly interacts with Ku70 protein through its Myc box II (MBII) domain. Removal of the MBII domain from c-Myc abrogates its inhibitory effects on Ku DNA binding, DNA-PKcs, and DNA end-joining activities, which results in loss of c-Myc's ability to block DSB repair and V(D)J recombination. Interestingly, c-Myc directly disrupts the Ku/DNA-PKcs complex in vitro and in vivo. Thus, c-Myc suppression of DSB repair and V(D)J recombination may occur through inhibition of the nonhomologous end-joining pathway, which provides insight into the mechanism of c-Myc in the development of tumors through promotion of genomic instability.",

     "abstract": "Radiation therapy (RT) is an effective strategy for the treatment of localized prostate cancer (PCa) as well as local invasion. However, some locally advanced cancers develop radiation resistance and recur after therapy; therefore, the development of radiation-sensitizing compounds is essential for treatment of these tumors. DOC-2/DAB2 interactive protein (DAB2IP), which is a novel member of the Ras-GTPase activating protein family and a regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt activity, is often downregulated in aggressive PCa. Our previous studies have shown that loss of DAB2IP results in radioresistance in PCa cells primarily because of accelerated DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair kinetics, robust G2/M checkpoint control, and evasion of apoptosis. A novel DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441 can significantly enhance the effect of radiation in DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells. This enhanced radiation sensitivity after NU7441 treatment is primarily due to delayed DNA DSB repair. More significantly, we found that DAB2IP-deficient PCa cells show dramatic induction of autophagy after treatment with radiation and NU7441. However, restoring DAB2IP expression in PCa cells resulted in decreased autophagy-associated proteins, such as LC3B and Beclin 1, as well as decreased phosphorylation of S6K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Furthermore, the presence of DAB2IP in PCa cells can lead to more apoptosis in response to combined treatment of NU7441 and ionizing radiation. Taken together, NU7441 is a potent radiosensitizer in aggressive PCa cells and DAB2IP plays a critical role in enhancing PCa cell death after combined treatment with NU7441 and radiation.",

     "abstract": "The expression of the angiogenic phenotype is regulated by a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors released into the tumor microenvironment. Nuclear protein 7 (NOL7), a novel tumor suppressor, acts as a master regulator of angiogenesis by downregulating pro-angiogenic factors and upregulating anti-angiogenic factors. Using cervical cancer as a model of investigation, we have previously shown that loss of NOL7 mRNA and protein expression is observed as early as the premalignant phase. Analysis of the gene failed to identify tumor-specific promoter methylation or coding region mutations, suggesting that NOL7 loss may be mediated by aberrant expression of its upstream regulators. In this study, we show that the RB tumor suppressor gene (RB) positively regulates NOL7 at the transcriptional level by recruiting transcription factors and transcription machinery proteins to its promoter region. Conversely, the loss of RB represses NOL7 transcription by inhibiting assembly of these proteins. This loss of NOL7 expression is also observed in RB-deficient human malignancies. Together, this work further characterizes the transcriptional activator function of RB and defines a potential role for RB in regulating angiogenesis through activation of NOL7. Current anti-angiogenic therapies lack long-term efficacy, as they are unable to target the diverse angiogenic signals generated by tumors. Our data provide evidence to support the hypothesis that reactivation of pRB can potentially modulate the expression of the angiogenic phenotype through regulation of NOL7. Therefore, this knowledge may be employed to design more comprehensive and effective therapies.",

Here, we analyzed the role of IRF-8 in the cross talk between melanoma cells and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. B16-F10 melanoma cells transplanted into IRF-8-deficient (IRF-8-/-) mice grow more rapidly, leading to higher numbers of lung metastasis, with respect to control animals. These events correlated with reduced dendritic cell and T cell infiltration, accumulation of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and a chemokine/chemokine receptor expression profile within the tumor microenvironment supporting tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Noticeably, primary tumors developing in IRF-8-/- mice displayed a clear-cut inhibition of IRF-8 expression in melanoma cells. Injection of the demethylating agent 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine into melanoma-bearing IRF-8-/- animals induced intratumoral IRF-8 expression and resulted in the re-establishment of a chemokine/ chemokine receptor pattern favoring leukocyte infiltration and melanoma growth arrest. Importantly, intrinsic IRF-8 expression was progressively down-modulated during melanoma growth in mice and in human metastatic melanoma cells with respect to primary tumors. Lastly, IRF-8 expression in melanoma cells was directly modulated by soluble factors, among which interleukin-27 (IL-27), released by immune cells from tumor-bearing mice.

     "abstract": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a genetically heterogeneous clonal disorder characterized by two molecularly distinct self-renewing leukemic stem cell (LSC) populations most closely related to normal progenitors and organized as a hierarchy. A requirement for WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in the pathogenesis of AML has recently been suggested by a mouse model. However, its relationship to a specific molecular function promoting retention of self-renewing leukemia-initiating cells (LICs) in human remains elusive. To identify transcriptional programs involved in the maintenance of a self-renewing state in LICs, we performed the expression profiling in normal (n = 10) and leukemic (n = 33) human long-term reconstituting AC133+ cells, which represent an expanded cell population in most AML patients. This study reveals the ligand-dependent WNT pathway activation in AC133bright AML cells and shows a diffuse expression and release of WNT10B, a hematopoietic stem cell regenerative-associated molecule. The establishment of a primary AC133+ AML cell culture (A46) demonstrated that leukemia cells synthesize and secrete WNT ligands, increasing the levels of dephosphorylated \u03b2-catenin in vivo. We tested the LSC functional activity in AC133+ cells and found significant levels of engraftment upon transplantation of A46 cells into irradiated Rag2-/-\u03b3c-/- mice. Owing to the link between hematopoietic regeneration and developmental signaling, we transplanted A46 cells into developing zebrafish. This system revealed the formation of ectopic structures by activating dorsal organizer markers that act downstream of the WNT pathway. In conclusion, our findings suggest that AC133bright LSCs are promoted by misappropriating homeostatic WNT programs that control hematopoietic regeneration.",

Nutritional intervention studies are often complex, and there is no clear evidence, without potential confounding factors, on whether conversion of n-6 PUFAs to n-3 PUFAs in pancreatic tissues would provide protection. Experiments were designed using n-3 fatty acid desaturase (Fat-1) transgenic mice, which can convert n-6 PUFA to n-3 FAs endogenously, to determine the impact of n-3 PUFAs on pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasms (PanINs) and their progression to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Six-weekold female p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ andcompoundFat-1-p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice were fed (AIN-76A) diets containing 10% safflower oil for 35 weeks. Pancreata were evaluated histopathologically for PanINs and PDAC. Results showed a dramatic reduction in incidence of PDAC (84%; P < .02) in Fat-1-p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice compared to p48Cre/+-LSL-KrasG12D/+ mice. Importantly, significant reductions of pancreatic ducts with carcinoma (90%; P < .0001) and PanIN 3 (\u223c50%; P < .001) lesions were observed in the compound transgenic mice.

In this study, we produced a function-blocking anti-S100A4 monoclonal antibody with metastasis-suppressing activity. Antibody treatment significantly reduced metastatic burden in the lungs of experimental animals by blocking the recruitment of T cells to the site of the primary tumor. In vitro studies demonstrated that this antibody efficiently reduced the invasion of T cells in a fibroblast monolayer. Moreover, it was capable of suppressing the invasive growth of human and mouse fibroblasts. We presume therefore that the antibody exerts its activity by suppressing stroma cell recruitment to the site of the growing tumor. Our epitope mapping studies suggested that the antibody recognition site overlaps with the target binding interface of human S100A4. We conclude here that this antibody could serve as a solid basis for development of an efficient anti-metastatic therapy.",

     "abstract": "Stromal fibroblasts, the most abundant and probably the most active cellular component of breast cancer-associated stroma, become active and promote angiogenesis through paracrine effects. However, it still unclear how these processes are regulated. Here, we have shown that down-regulation of the tumor suppressor p16INK4A protein enhances the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts, which form dendritic network of extensions into matrigel. Furthermore, we present clear evidence that p16INK4A represses the expression/secretion of the proangiogenesis protein vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Consequently, p16INK4A-deficient breast stromal fibroblasts and mouse embryonic fibroblasts enhanced endothelial cell differentiation into capillary-like structures in a paracrine manner. This effect was suppressed by adding bevacizumab, a specific VEGF-A inhibitor. Additionally, p16INK4A-defective mouse embryonic fibroblasts enhanced angiogenesis in breast cancer xenografts in mice. Furthermore, we have shown that p16INK4A suppresses the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and its downstream effector hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1\u03b1), which transactivates VEGF-A. Consequently, Akt inactivation suppressed both the p16INK4A-dependent autocrine effect on fibroblast migration/invasion and the paracrine effect on angiogenesis, showing the important role of this protein kinase in mediating the various effects related to p16INK4A deficiency. These results indicate that p16INK4A is an efficient inhibitor of the migration/invasion abilities of breast stromal fibroblasts and also their paracrine proangiogenic effects, through inhibition of Akt. Therefore, pharmacologic restoration of p16INK4A level in stromal fibroblasts may be exploited as therapeutic strategy to help eradicate tumor cells and/or prevent their recurrence, through suppressing cell non-autonomous procarcinogenic mediators.",

To assess the role of complement during ovarian cancer progression, we crossed two strains of mice with genetic complement deficiencies with transgenic mice that develop epithelial ovarian cancer (TgMISIIR-TAg). TgMISIIR-TAg mice fully or partially deficient for complement factor 3 (C3) (Tg+C3KO and Tg+C3HET, respectively) or fully deficient for complement factor C5a receptor (C5aR) (Tg+C5aRKO) develop either no ovarian tumors or tumors that were small and poorly vascularized compared to wild-type littermates (Tg+C3WT, Tg+C5aRWT). The percentage of tumor infiltrating immune cells in Tg+C3HET tumors compared to Tg+C3WT controls was either similar (macrophages, B cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells), elevated (effector T cells), or decreased (regulatory T cells). Regardless of these ratios, cytokine production by immune cells taken from Tg+C3HET tumors was reduced on stimulation compared to Tg+C3WT controls. Interestingly, CD31+ endothelial cell (EC) function in angiogenesis was significantly impaired in both C3KO and C5aRKO mice. Further, using the C5aR antagonist PMX53, tube formation of ECs was shown to be C5a-dependent, possibly through interactions with the VEGF165 but not VEGF121 isoform. Finally, the mouse VEGF164 transcript was underexpressed in C3KO livers compare to C3WT livers. Thus, we conclude that complement inhibition blocks tumor outgrowth by altering EC function and VEGF165 expression.",

Collectively, the results demonstrate the importance of RPTP-\u03b2 in tumor biology of HNSCC through direct dephosphorylation of Met and regulation of downstream signal transduction pathways.

We therefore assessed the epitope recognition of panitumumab by screening phage-displayed random cyclic 7mer and linear 12mer peptide libraries on this antibody. Phage screenings revealed two strong, potentially epitope-mimicking consensus motifs targeted by panitumumab. A computational approach was used to map the sequences back to the potential epitope region on domain III of EGFR. The presumed epitope regions (386)WPEXRT(391) and a biochemically similar though discontinuous region P349-F352-D355 on a neighboring loop of domain III could be confirmed as part of the functionally relevant binding site of panitumumab by site-directed mutational analysis. To more accurately differentiate the panitumumab epitope from the previously characterized cetuximab epitope, binding studies were performed on a broad range of additional mutants. Taken together, this analysis revealed two large, partially overlapping functional epitopes consisting of 17 critical amino acid positions. Four of these positions were selectively targeted by cetuximab (I467, S468, Q408, and H409), whereas another four were selectively recognized by panitumumab (W386, E388, R390, and T391).

Using a lentiviral-based shRNA delivery system, we examined in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation characteristics of knockdown cell lines for the endogenous PCs furin, PACE4, and PC7 in both cell lines. Of the three PCs, only PACE4 was essential to maintain a high-proliferative status, as determined in vitro using XTT proliferation assays and in vivo using tumor xenografts in nude mice. Furin knockdowns in both cell lines had no effects on cell proliferation or tumor xenograft growth. Paradoxically, PC7 knockdowns reduced in vitro cellular proliferation but had no effect in vivo. Because PCs act within secretion pathways, we showed that conditioned media derived from PACE4 knockdown cells had very poor cell growth-stimulating effects in vitro. Immunohistochemistry of PACE4 knockdown tumors revealed reduced Ki67 and higher p27KIP levels (proliferation and cell cycle arrest markers, respectively). Interestingly, we determined that the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway was activated in PC7 knockdown tumors only, providing some explanations of the paradoxical effects of PC7 silencing in prostate cancer cell lines.

Several mechanisms have been identified in AR activation, among them signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Disruption of STAT3 activity has been associated to cancer progression. Recent studies suggest that heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) may play a key role in PCa that may be independent of its catalytic function. We sought to explore whether HO-1 operates on AR transcriptional activity through the STAT3 axis. Our results display that HO-1 induction in PCa cells represses AR activation by decreasing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter activity and mRNA levels. Strikingly, this is the first report to show by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that HO-1 associates to gene promoters, revealing a novel function for HO-1 in the nucleus. Furthermore, HO-1 and STAT3 directly interact as determined by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Forced expression of HO-1 increases STAT3 cytoplasmic retention. When PCa cells were transfected with a constitutively active STAT3 mutant, PSA and STAT3 downstream target genes were abrogated under hemin treatment. Additionally, a significant decrease in pSTAT3 protein levels was detected in the nuclear fraction of these cells. Confocal microscopy images exhibit a decreased rate of AR/STAT3 nuclear co-localization under hemin treatment. In vivo studies confirmed that STAT3 nuclear delimitation was significantly decreased in PC3 tumors overexpressing HO-1 grown as xenografts in nude mice.

     "abstract": "While normal cells in the human breast are organized into acinar structures, disruption of the acinar architecture is a hallmark of cancer. In a three-dimensional model of morphogenesis, we show that down-regulation of the matrix-associated tumor suppressor protein CCN6 (WNT1-inducible-signaling pathway protein 3) disrupts breast epithelial cell polarity and organization into acini through up-regulation of the type III transforming growth factor-\u03b2 receptor (T\u03b2RIII or betaglycan). Down-regulation of CCN6 in benign breast cells led to loss of tissue polarity and resulted in cellular disorganization with loss of \u03b16 integrin-rich basement membrane and the basolateral polarity protein E-cadherin. Silencing of T\u03b2RIII with shRNA and siRNA rescued the ability of breast epithelial cells to form polarized acinar structures with reduced matrix invasion and restored the correct expression of \u03b16 integrin and E-cadherin. Conversely, CCN6 overexpression in aggressive breast cancer cells reduced T\u03b2RIII in vitro and in a xenograft model of CCN6 overexpression. The relevance of our studies to human breast cancer is highlighted by the finding that CCN6 protein levels are inversely associated with T\u03b2RIII protein in 64%of invasive breast carcinomas. These results reveal a novel function of the matricellular protein CCN6 and establish a mechanistic link between CCN6 and T\u03b2RIII in maintaining acinar organization in the breast.",

     "abstract": "Lung cancer causes more deaths, worldwide, than any other cancer. Several histologic subtypes exist. Currently, there is a dearth of targeted therapies for treating one of the main subtypes: squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). As for many cancers, lung SCC karyotypes are often highly anomalous owing to large somatic structural variants, some of which are seen repeatedly in lung SCC, indicating a potential causal association for genes therein. We chose to characterize a lung SCC genome to unprecedented detail and integrate our findings with the concurrently characterized transcriptome. We aimed to ascertain how somatic structural changes affected gene expression within the cell in ways that could confer a pathogenic phenotype. We sequenced the genomes of a lung SCC cell line (LUDLU-1) and its matched lymphocyte cell line (AGLCL) to more than 50x coverage. We also sequenced the transcriptomes of LUDLU-1 and a normal bronchial epithelium cell line (LIMM-NBE1), resulting in more than 600 million aligned reads per sample, including both coding and non-coding RNA (ncRNA), in a strand-directional manner. We also captured small RNA (<30 bp). We discovered significant, but weak, correlations between copy number and expression for protein-coding genes, antisense transcripts, long intergenic ncRNA, and microRNA (miRNA). We found that miRNA undergo the largest change in overall expression pattern between the normal bronchial epithelium and the tumor cell line. We found evidence of transcription across the novel genomic sequence created from six somatic structural variants. For each part of our integrated analysis, we highlight candidate genes that have undergone the largest expression changes.",

High-throughput, long-read sequencing was then performed on cDNA libraries from major tumor histotypes and corresponding normal tissues. These analyses led to the identification of 378 chimeras, with an unexpectedly high frequency of expression (\u22482 x 10-5 of all mRNA). Functional assays in breast and ovarian cancer cell lines showed that a large fraction of mRNA chimeras regulates cell replication. Strikingly, chimeras were shown to include both positive and negative regulators of cell growth, which functioned as such in a cell-type-specific manner. Replication-controlling chimeras were found to be expressed by most cancers from breast, ovary, colon, uterus, kidney, lung, and stomach, suggesting a widespread role in tumor development.",

     "abstract": "We recently demonstrated that lack of Furin-processing of the N-cadherin precursor (proNCAD) in highly invasive melanoma and brain tumor cells results in the cell-surface expression of a nonadhesive protein favoring cell migration and invasion in vitro. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of malignant human brain tumor cells revealed that of all proprotein convertases (PCs) only the levels of Furin and PC5A are modulated, being inversely (Furin) or directly (PC5A) correlated with brain tumor invasive capacity. Intriguingly, the N-terminal sequence following the Furin-activated NCAD site (RQKR\u2193D W 161, mouse nomenclature) reveals a second putative PC-processing site (RIRSDR\u2193DK189) located in the first extracellular domain. Cleavage at this site would abolish the adhesive functions of NCAD because of the loss of the critical Trp161. This was confirmed upon analysis of the fate of the endogenous prosegment of proNCAD in human malignant glioma cells expressing high levels of Furin and low levels of PC5A (U343) or high levels of PC5A and negligible Furin levels (U251). Cellular analyses revealed that Furin is the best activating convertase releasing an \u223c17-kDa prosegment, whereas PC5A is the major inactivating enzyme resulting in the secretion of an \u223c20-kDa product. Like expression of proNCAD at the cell surface, cleavage of the NCAD molecule at RIRSDR\u2193DK189 renders the U251 cancer cells less adhesive to one another and more migratory. Our work modifies the present view on posttranslational processing and surface expression of classic cadherins and clarifies how NCAD possesses a range of adhesive potentials and plays a critical role in tumor progression.",

Mcl-1 differs from other Bcl-2 members by its high turnover rate. Its expression level is tightly regulated by ubiquitylating and deubiquitylating enzymes. Interaction of Mcl-1 with certain Bcl-2 homology domain 3 (BH3)-only members of the Bcl-2 family can limit the access to Mcl-1 ubiquitin ligase E3 and stabilizes the antiapoptotic protein. In addition, the overexpression of the deubiquitinase ubiquitin-specific protease 9x (USP9x) can result in the accumulation of Mcl-1 by removing poly-ubiquitin chains from Mcl-1 preventing its proteasomal degradation. Analyzing radiation-induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells, we found that Mcl-1 was downregulated more efficiently in sensitive parental cells than in a resistant subclone. The decline of Mcl-1 correlated with cell death induction and clonogenic survival. Knockdown of BH3-only proteins Bim, Puma, and Noxa did not affect Mcl-1 level or radiation-induced apoptosis. However, ionizing radiation resulted in activation of USP9x and enhanced deubiquitination of Mcl-1 in the radioresistant cells preventing fast Mcl-1 degradation. USP9x knockdown enhanced radiation-induced decrease of Mcl-1 and sensitized the radioresistant cells to apoptosis induction, whereas USP9x knockdown alone did not change Mcl-1 level in unirradiated cells. Together, our results indicate that radiation-induced activation of USP9x inhibits Mcl-1 degradation and apoptosis resulting in increased radioresistance.",

In vivo studies using chicken chorioallantoic membrane assay, xenograft studies, and murine metastasis models suggested a role for CtBP1 in prostate tumor growth and metastasis.

We found that nuclear expression of STAT5b can be detected in approximately 50% of DPAC. Blockade of STAT5b by stable shRNA-mediated knockdown showed no effects on tumor cell growth in vitro. However, inhibition of tumor cell motility was found even in response to stimulation with epidermal growth factor or interleukin-6. These findings were paralleled by a reduction of prometastatic and proangiogenic factors in vitro. Subsequent in vivo experiments revealed a strong growth inhibition on STAT5b blockade in subcutaneous and orthotopic models. These findings were paralleled by impaired tumor angiogenesis in vivo. In contrast to the subcutaneous model, the orthotopic model revealed a strong reduction of tumor cell proliferation that emphasizes the meaning of assessing targets in an appropriate microenvironment.

Current models do not recapitulate the basaloid phenotype of TNBC, thus limiting the understanding of its biology and designing new treatments. We identified HCC1806 as a line expressing typical B-TNBC markers, engineered a subline with traceable reporters, and determined growth, drug sensitivity, recurrence, and vascular and metastatic patterns of orthotopic xenografts in immunodeficient mice. Methods: mRNA and protein analyses showed that HCC1806 expresses basal but not luminal or mesenchymal markers. HCC1806-RR subline stably expressing red fluorescent protein and Renilla luciferase was generated and characterized for sensitivity to chemodrugs, orthotopic growth, vascular properties, recurrence, metastasis, and responsiveness in vivo. Results: The HCC1806 cells were highly sensitive to paclitaxel, but cytotoxicity was accompanied by pro-survival vascular endothelial growth factor-A loop. In vivo, HCC1806-RR tumors display linear growth, induce peritumoral lymphatics, and spontaneously metastasize to lymph nodes (LNs) and lungs. Similarly to human B-TNBC, HCC1806-RR tumors were initially sensitive to taxane therapy but subsequently recur. Bevacizumab significantly suppressed recurrence by 50% and reduced the incidence of LN and pulmonary metastases by, respectively, 50% and 87%. Conclusions The HCC1806-RR is a new model that expresses bona fide markers of B-TNBC and traceable markers for quantifying metastases. Combination of bevacizumab with nab-paclitaxel significantly improved the outcome, suggesting that this approach can apply to human patients with B-TNBC. This model can be used for defining the metastatic mechanisms of B-TNBC and testing new therapies.",

They consist of a heterogeneous cell population with diverse origins, phenotypes, and functions. In the present report, we have explored the contribution of bone marrow (BM)-derived cells to generate different fibroblast subsets that putatively produce the matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and affect cancer cell invasion. A murine model of skin carcinoma was applied to mice, irradiated, and engrafted with BM isolated from green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic mice. We provide evidence that one third of BM-derived GFP+ cells infiltrating the tumor expressed the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan NG2 (pericytic marker) or \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA, myofibroblast marker), whereas almost 90% of Thy1+ fibroblasts were originating from resident GFP-negative cells. MMP13producing cells were exclusively \u03b1-SMA+ cells and derived from GFP+ BM cells. To investigate their impact on tumor invasion, we isolated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from the BM of wild-type and MMP13-deficient mice. Wild-type MSC promoted cancer cell invasion in a spheroid assay, whereas MSCs obtained from MMP13-deficient mice failed to. Our data support the concept of fibroblast subset specialization with BM-derived \u03b1-SMA+ cells being the main source of MMP13, a stromal mediator of cancer cell invasion.",

     "abstract": "Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are classified as either seminomas or nonseminomas. Both tumors originate from carcinoma in situ (CIS) cells, which are derived from transformed fetal gonocytes. CIS, seminoma, and the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma (EC) retain an embryonic phenotype and express pluripotency factors (NANOG/OCT4). Vitamin D (VD) is metabolized in the testes, and here, we examined VD metabolism in TGCT differentiation and pluripotency regulation. We established that the VD receptor (VDR) and VD-metabolizing enzymes are expressed in human fetal germ cells, CIS, and invasive TGCTs. VD metabolism diminished markedly during the malignant transformation from CIS to EC but was reestablished in differentiated components of nonseminomas, distinguished by coexpression of mesodermal markers and loss of OCT4. Subsequent in vitro studies confirmed that 1,25(OH)2D3 (active VD) downregulated NANOG and OCT4 through genomic VDR activation in EC-derived NTera2 cells and, to a lesser extent, in seminoma-derived TCam-2 cells, and up-regulated brachyury, SNAI1, osteocalcin, osteopontin, and fibroblast growth factor 23. To test for a possible therapeutic effect in vivo, NTera2 cells were xenografted into nude mice and treated with 1,25(OH)2D3, which induced down-regulation of pluripotency factors but caused no significant reduction of tumor growth. During NTera2 tumor formation, down-regulation of VDR was observed, resulting in limited responsiveness to cholecalciferol and 1,25(OH)2D3 treatment in vivo. These novel findings show that VD metabolism is involved in the mesodermal transition during differentiation of cancer cells with embryonic stem cell characteristics, which points to a function for VD during early embryonic development and possibly in the pathogenesis of TGCTs.",

Pre-contrast and post-contrast images (4 hours) were acquired at a 9.4-T MRI system and revealed significant differences in the nanoparticle accumulation patterns between the two tumor models. In the case of the highly vascularized LS174T tumors, the accumulation was more confined to the periphery of the tumors, where angiogenesis is predominantly occurring.

Claudin-3 (CLDN3) and claudin-4 (CLDN4) are highly expressed in the majority of ovarian cancers. We report here that CLDN3 and CLDN4 each serve to constrain the growth of human 2008 cancer xenografts and limit metastatic potential. Knockdown of CLDN3 increased in vivo growth rate by 2.3-fold and knockdown of CLDN4 by 3.7-fold in the absence of significant change in in vitro growth rate. Both types of tumors exhibited increase in birth rate as measured by Ki67 staining and decrease in death rate as reflected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Knockdown of either claudin did not alter expression of other TJ protein but did reduce TJ formation as measured by transepithelial resistance and paracellular flux of dextran, enhance migration and invasion in in vitro assays, and increase lung colonization following intravenous injection. Knockdown of CLDN3 and CLDN4 increased total lung metastatic burden by 1.7-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively. Loss of either CLDN3 or CLDN4 resulted in down-regulation of E-cadherin mRNA and protein, increased inhibitory phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2), and activation of \u03b2-catenin pathway signaling as evidenced by increases in nuclear \u03b2-catenin, the dephosphorylated form of the protein, and transcriptional activity of \u03b2-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF).

     "abstract": "AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A) has emerged as a new tumor suppressor in which frequent somatic mutations have been identified in several types of human cancers. Although most ARID1A somatic mutations are frame-shift or nonsense mutations that contribute to mRNA decay and loss of protein expression, 5% of ARID1A mutations are in-frame insertions or deletions (indels) that involve only a small stretch of peptides. Naturally occurring in-frame indel mutations provide unique and useful models to explore the biology and regulatory role of ARID1A. In this study, we analyzed indel mutations identified in gynecological cancers to determine how these mutations affect the tumor suppressor function of ARID1A. Our results demonstrate that all in-frame mutants analyzed lost their ability to inhibit cellular proliferation or activate transcription of CDKN1A, which encodes p21, a downstream effector of ARID1A. We also showed that ARID1A is a nucleocytoplasmic protein whose stability depends on its subcellular localization. Nuclear ARID1A is less stable than cytoplasmic ARID1A because ARID1A is rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the nucleus. In-frame deletions affecting the consensus nuclear export signal reduce steady-state protein levels of ARID1A. This defect in nuclear exportation leads to nuclear retention and subsequent degradation. Our findings delineate a mechanism underlying the regulation of ARID1A subcellular distribution and protein stability and suggest that targeting the nuclear ubiquitin-proteasome system can increase the amount of the ARID1A protein in the nucleus and restore its tumor suppressor functions.",

     "abstract": "Chordoma is a rare tumor arising in the sacrum, clivus, or vertebrae. It is often not completely resectable and shows a high incidence of recurrence and progression with shortened patient survival and impaired quality of life. Chemotherapeutic options are limited to investigational therapies at present. Therefore, adjuvant therapy for control of tumor recurrence and progression is of great interest, especially in skull base lesions where complete tumor resection is often not possible because of the proximity of cranial nerves. To understand the extent of genetic instability and associated chromosomal and gene losses or gains in skull base chordoma, we undertook whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray analysis of flash frozen surgical chordoma specimens, 21 from the clivus and 1 from C1 to C2 vertebrae. We confirm the presence of a deletion at 9p involving CDKN2A, CDKN2B, and MTAP but at a much lower rate (22%) than previously reported for sacral chordoma. At a similar frequency (21%), we found aneuploidy of chromosome 3. Tissue microarray immunohistochemistry demonstrated absent or reduced fragile histidine triad (FHIT) protein expression in 98% of sacral chordomas and 67%of skull base chordomas. Our data suggest that chromosome 3 aneuploidy and epigenetic regulation of FHIT contribute to loss of the FHIT tumor suppressor in chordoma. The finding that FHIT is lost in a majority of chordomas provides new insight into chordoma pathogenesis and points to a potential new therapeutic target for this challenging neoplasm.",

     "abstract": "Centrosomes play a crucial role in the maintenance of genome stability by orchestrating bipolar mitotic spindle formation. The centrosome normally duplicates precisely once before mitosis in a process that is extensively regulated by protein degradation including SKP1-Cullin 1 (CUL1)-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. The core SCF component CUL1 has recently been found to be required to suppress the formation of supernumerary centrosomes and centrioles, the core-forming units of centrosomes. Here, we identify the CUL1-interacting protein cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated 1 (CAND1) as a novel centrosomal protein with a role in centriole duplication control. CAND1 was found to synergize with Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4), a master regulator of centriole biogenesis, in the induction of centriole overduplication. We provide evidence that CAND1 functions in this process by increasing PLK4 protein stability. Furthermore, mutants of CUL1 that lack the ability to interact with CAND1 and are unable to assemble functional E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes were impaired in their ability to restrain aberrant daughter centriole synthesis. To corroborate a role of CAND1 in human carcinogenesis, we analyzed a series of prostate adenocarcinomas and found altered expression of CAND1 on the mRNA or protein level in 52.9% and 40.8%, respectively, of the tumor samples analyzed. These results highlight the role of altered SCF components in cancer in general and encourage further studies to explore the SCF-CAND1 axis for the development of novel predictive biomarkers and therapeutic approaches in prostate cancer.",

Genetic data on ILMS are still limited but have suggested that this entity is characterized by hyperhaploidy (24\u201334 chromosomes). This low chromosome number is otherwise uncommon in neoplasia and has been found only in 0.2% to 0.3% of cytogenetically investigated tumors. Here, three ILMS were investigated using cytogenetic, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and global gene expression analyses. All cases displayed a hyperhaploid origin. Combined with previously reported cases, hyperhaploidy has been found in six of seven cytogenetically investigated ILMS. The copy number distribution of individual chromosomes is clearly nonrandom; the hyperhaploid clones of all six cases displayed disomy for chromosomes 5 and 20, and two copies of chromosomes 18, 21, and 22 were also common. All chromosomes identified as disomic showed a biparental origin by SNP array analysis; whether this is of pathogenetic importance is not known. Compared with conventional LMS, ILMS had a distinct gene expression signature. Furthermore, the number of chromosome copies correlated well with gene expression levels; disomic chromosomes showed higher gene expression levels than monosomic chromosomes, a finding that has not previously been reported for hyperhaploid tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest that disomy for some chromosomes, notably 5 and 20, as well as distorted gene expression achieved through massive loss of other chromosomes are essential features of ILMS.",

Survival of a fraction of tumor cells and development of chemoresistance may be influenced by an initial cellular stress response against the administered xenobiotics. Therefore, we compared the short-term effects of cisplatin and non-cross-resistant bis-[(p-methoxybenzyl)cyclopentadienyl] titanium(IV) dichloride (Titanocene Y) on phosphorylation of 46 sites of a total of 38 signaling proteins in tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53)-wild-type NCI-H526 SCLC cells. The functional significance of selected kinases for the cytotoxicity of both drugs was tested using specific inhibitors and an activator. The cisplatin-induced cellular stress response involved activation of p38\u03b1 mitogen-activated protein kinase, whereas Titanocene Y-triggered signaling affected c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase \u03b11 (AMPK\u03b11) was increased by both drugs, which promoted cell survival, as indicated by results obtained using AMPK inhibitor compound C and AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-\u03b2-d-ribofuranoside. This is in good agreement with previous reports, where AMPK\u03b11 was demonstrated to represent an important factor for the sensitivity to cisplatin in colon and ovarian cancers, most likely by induction of autophagy. Thus, AMPK\u03b11 constitutes a potential target to be exploited for chemotherapeutic treatment of SCLC to circumvent resistance to metal-based compounds.",

The complex genomic pattern is a prognostic marker independent of NB-associated chromosomal aberrations, i.e., MYCN amplification, 1p and 11q losses, and 17q gain. Integrative analysis of genomic and expression signatures demonstrated that fatal outcome is mainly associated with loss of cell cycle control and deregulation of Rho guanosine triphosphates (GTPases) functioning in neuritogenesis. Tumors with MYCN amplification show a lower chromosome instability compared to MYCN single-copy NBs (P = .0008), dominated by 17q gain and 1p loss.

METHODS: Human endothelial cells [human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and human umbilical vascular endothelial cell (HUVEC)] and pancreatic cancer cells (Capan-1 and MIA PaCa-2) were treated with the ceramide analogs (C2, AL6, C6, and C8), at low concentrations for 144 hours to evaluate any antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects and inhibition of migration and to measure the expression of caveolin-1 (CAV-1) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) mRNAs by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Assessment of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and Akt phosphorylation and of CAV-1 and cyclin D1 protein expression was performed by ELISA. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) gemcitabine was compared against metronomic doses of the ceramide analogs by evaluating the inhibition of MIA PaCa-2 subcutaneous tumor growth in nude mice. RESULTS: Metronomic ceramide analogs preferentially inhibited cell proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in endothelial cells. Low concentrations of AL6 and C2 caused a significant inhibition of HUVEC migration. ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation were significantly decreased after metronomic ceramide analog treatment. Such treatment caused the overexpression of CAV-1 and TSP-1 mRNAs and proteins in endothelial cells, whereas cyclin D1 protein levels were reduced. The antiangiogenic and antitumor impact in vivo of metronomic C2 and AL6 regimens was similar to that caused by MTD gemcitabine. CONCLUSIONS: Metronomic C2 and AL6 analogs have antitumor and antiangiogenic activity, determining the up-regulation of CAV-1 and TSP-1 and the suppression of cyclin D1.",

     "abstract": "Taxanes are potent inhibitors of cell motility, a property implicated in their antiangiogenic and antimetastatic activity and unrelated to their antiproliferative effect. The molecular mechanism of this anti-motility activity is poorly understood. In this study, we found that paclitaxel induced tubulin acetylation in endothelial and tumor cells, at concentrations that affected cell motility but not proliferation (10-8 to 10-9 M, for 4 hours). Induction of tubulin acetylation correlated with inhibition of motility but not proliferation based on a comparison of highly and poorly cytotoxic taxanes (paclitaxel and IDN5390) and tumor cell lines sensitive and resistant to paclitaxel (1A9 and 1A9 PTX22). Consistent with the hypothesis that tubulin deacetylase activity might affect cell response to the anti-motility activity of taxanes, we found that overexpression of the tubulin deacetylase SIRT2 increased cell motility and reduced cell response to the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. Conversely, the SIRT2 inhibitor splitomicin reduced cell motility and potentiated the anti-motility activity of paclitaxel. The inhibitory effect was further potentiated by the addition of the HDAC6 inhibitor trichostatin A. Paclitaxel and splitomicin promoted translocation into the nucleus\u2014and hence activation\u2014of FOXO3a, a negative regulator of cell motility. This study indicates a role for SIRT2 in the regulation of cell motility and suggests that therapies combining sirtuin inhibitors and taxanes could be used to treat cell motility-based pathologic processes such as tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis.",

An ideal combination strategy may consist of agents with different mechanisms of action leading to complementary antitumor activities and safety profiles. In the present study, we investigated the effects of the epigenetic modulator apicidin in combination with the cytotoxic agent docetaxel in tumor breast cell lines characterized by different grades of invasiveness. We report that combined treatment of apicidin and docetaxel, at low toxicity doses, stimulates in metastatic breast cancer cells the expression of CTCF-like protein and other cancer antigens, thus potentially favoring an antitumor immune response. In addition, apicidin and docetaxel co-treatment specifically stimulates apoptosis, characterized by an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase-8 activation. Importantly, following combined exposure to these agents, metastatic cells were also found to induce signals of immunogenic apoptosis such as cell surface expression of calreticulin and release of considerable amounts of high-mobility group box 1 protein, thus potentially promoting the translation of induced cell death into antitumor immune response. Altogether, our results indicate that the combined use of apicidin and docetaxel, at a low toxicity profile, may represent a potential innovative strategy able to activate complementary antitumor pathways in metastatic breast cancer cells, associated with a potential control of metastatic growth and possible induction of antitumor immunity.",

By integrating the effect of miRNA up-regulation with the endogenous miRNA expression levels within the HT29, HCT116, and SW480 colon cancer cell lines, we identified miRNAs controlling cell proliferation (n = 53) and apoptosis (n = 93). From these functionally nominated miRNAs, we narrowed the list to 10 oncogene- and 20 tumor suppressor-like miRNAs that were also differentially expressed between colon cancer (n = 80) and normal colonic mucosa (n = 20). The differential expressions of miR-9, miR-31, and miR-182 were successfully validated in a series of colon carcinomas (n = 30) and polyps (n = 10) versus normal colonic mucosa (n = 10), whereas the functional effect was confirmed in an in-depth validation using different cell viability and apoptotic markers. Several transcription factors and genes regulating cell proliferation were identified as putative target genes by integrative miRNA/mRNA expression analysis obtained from the same colon cancer patient samples.

We have previously found that EGFR stability plays a key role in cell survival after chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is known to stabilize mutant EGFR and ErbB2, but its role in cancers with wild-type (WT) WT-EGFR is unclear. In this report, we demonstrate that fully mature, membrane-bound WT-EGFR interacts with HSP90 independent of ErbB2. Further, the HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin (GA) and AT13387 cause a decrease in WT-EGFR in cultured head and neck cancer cells. This decrease results from a significantly reduced half-life of WT-EGFR. WT-EGFR was also lost in head and neck xenograft specimens after treatment with AT13387 under conditions that inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice. Our findings demonstrate that WT-EGFR is a client protein of HSP90 and that their interaction is critical for maintaining both the stability of the receptor as well as the growth of EGFR-dependent cancers. Furthermore, these findings support the search for specific agents that disrupt HSP90's ability to act as an EGFR chaperone.",

     "abstract": "ErbB2+ human breast cancer is a major clinical problem. Prior results have suggested that tetraspanin CD151 might contribute to ErbB2-driven breast cancer growth, survival, and metastasis. In other cancer types, CD151 sometimes supports tumor growth and metastasis. However, a definitive test of CD151 effects on de novo breast cancer initiation, growth, and metastasis has not previously been done. We used CD151 gene-deleted mice expressing the MMTV-ErbB2 transgene to show that CD151 strongly supports ErbB2+ mammary tumor initiation and metastasis. Delayed tumor onset (by 70\u2013100 days) in the absence of CD151 was accompanied by reduced survival of mammary epithelial cells and impaired activation of FAK- and MAPK-dependent pathways. Both primary tumors and metastatic nodules showed smooth, regular borders, consistent with a less invasive phenotype. Furthermore, consistent with impaired oncogenesis and decreased metastasis, CD151-targeted MCF-10A/ErbB2 cells showed substantial decreases in three-dimensional colony formation, EGF-stimulated tumor cell motility, invasion, and transendothelial migration. These CD151-dependent functions were largely mediated through \u03b16\u03b24 integrin. Moreover, CD151 ablation substantially prevented PKC- and EGFR/ERK-dependent \u03b16\u03b24 integrin phosphorylation, consistent with retention of epithelial cell polarity and intermediate filament cytoskeletal connections, which helps to explain diminished metastasis. Finally, clinical data analyses revealed a strong correlation between CD151 and ErbB2 expression and metastasis-free survival of breast cancer patients. In conclusion, we provide strong evidence that CD151 collaborates with LB integrins (particularly \u03b16\u03b24) and ErbB2 (and EGFR) receptors to regulate multiple signaling pathways, thereby driving mammary tumor onset, survival, and metastasis. Consequently, CD151 is a useful therapeutic target in malignant ErbB2+ breast cancer.",

Stromal cell.derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1)-CXCR4 signaling was examined as a representative microenvironmental factor able to promote mTOR-targeted therapy resistance in pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Primary pancreas explant xenografts and in vitro experiments were used to perform pharmacodynamic analyses of SDF-1\u03b1-CXCR4 regulation of the mTOR pathway. Combinatorial effects of CXCR4, EGFR, and mTOR pharmacologic inhibition were evaluated in temsirolimus-resistant and -sensitive xenografts. Intratumoral gene and protein expressions of mTOR pathway effectors cyclin D1, c-Myc, and VEGF were evaluated. RESULTS: Baseline intratumoral SDF-1\u03b1 gene expression correlated with temsirolimus resistance in explant models. SDF-1\u03b1 stimulation of pancreatic cells resulted in CXCR4-mediated PI3-kinase-dependent S6-RP phosphorylation (pS6-RP) on exposure to temsirolimus. Combinatorial therapy with AMD3465 (CXCR4 small-molecule inhibitor) and temsirolimus resulted in effective tumor growth inhibition to overcome temsirolimus resistance. In contrast, SDF-1\u03b1 exposure induced a temsirolimus-resistant phenotype in temsirolimus-sensitive explants. AMD3465 inhibited CXCR4-mediated intratumoral S6-RP phosphorylation and cyclin D and c-myc gene expression. Next, CXCR4 promoted intratumoral EGFR expression in association with temsirolimus resistance. Treatment with AMD3465, temsirolimus- and erlotinib-mediated tumor growth inhibition to overcome temsirolimus resistance in the explant model. Lastly, SDF-1\u03b1-CXCR4 signaling increased intratumoral VEGF gene and protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: SDF-1\u03b1-CXCR4 signaling represents a microenvironmental factor that can maintain mTOR pathway fidelity to promote resistance to mTOR-targeted therapy in pancreatic cancer by a variety of mechanisms such as recruitment of EGFR signaling and angiogenesis.",

Integrative analysis of a panel of 14 breast cancer cell lines comparing gene fusions discovered by high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and genome-wide copy number aberrations assessed by array comparative genomic hybridization, led to the identification of 77 gene fusions, of which more than 60% were localized to amplicons including 17q12, 17q23, 20q13, chr8q, and others. Many of these fusions appeared to be recurrent or involved highly expressed oncogenic drivers, frequently fused with multiple different partners, but sometimes displaying loss of functional domains. As illustrative examples of the \u201camplicon-associated\u201d gene fusions, we examined here a recurrent gene fusion involving the mediator of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling, RPS6KB1 kinase in BT-474, and the therapeutically important receptor tyrosine kinase EGFR in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line. These gene fusions comprise a minor allelic fraction relative to the highly expressed full-length transcripts and encode chimera lacking the kinase domains, which do not impart dependence on the respective cells. Our study suggests that amplicon-associated gene fusions in breast cancer primarily represent a by-product of chromosomal amplifications, which constitutes a subset of passenger aberrations and should be factored accordingly during prioritization of gene fusion candidates.",

     "abstract": "Several in vitro and in vivo models have revealed the key role of CXCR4/CXCL12 axis in tumor-stroma interactions. Stromal cells present in the tumor microenvironment express high levels of CXCL12 protein, directly stimulating proliferation and migration of CXCR4-expressing cancer cells. This specific prosurvival influence of stromal cells on tumor cells is thought to protect them from cytotoxic chemotherapy and is postulated as a possible explanation for the minimal residual disease in hematological and solid cancers. Therefore, CXCR4/CXCL12 signaling is an attractive therapeutic target in cancer, as proven in preclinical leukemia mouse models, where CXCR4 inhibition sensitized cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy. This study investigates whether inhibition of CXCR4 with the specific inhibitor AMD3100 sensitizes human prostate cancer cells to docetaxel. We showed that both mouse and human stromal cell lines have a protective effect on PC3-luc cells by promoting their survival after chemotherapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that AMD3100 sensitizes PC3-luc cells to docetaxel. In a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model of human prostate carcinoma, we showed that a combination of docetaxel and AMD3100 exerts increased antitumor effect compared with docetaxel alone. We concluded that CXCR4 inhibition chemosensitizes prostate cancer cells, both in vitro and in vivo. To explore the relevance of these findings, we analyzed CXCR4 expression levels in human prostate cancer samples. We found that cancer cells present in bone metastatic lesions express higher CXCR4 levels relative to the cells present in primary tumors and lymph node metastatic lesions. These findings underscore the potential of CXCR4 inhibitors as chemosensitizing agents.",

Recent data indicate that PDK1 is overexpressed in many breast carcinomas and that alterations of PDK1 are critical in the context of oncogenic PI3K activation. However, the role of PDK1 in tumor progression is still controversial. Here, we show that PDK1 is required for anchorage-independent and xenograft growth of breast cancer cells harboring either PI3KCA or KRAS mutations. In fact, PDK1 silencing leads to increased anoikis, reduced soft agar growth, and pronounced apoptosis inside tumors. Interestingly, these phenotypes are reverted by PDK1 wild-type but not kinase-dead mutant, suggesting a relevant role of PDK1 kinase activity, even if PDK1 is not relevant for Akt activation here. Indeed, the expression of constitutively active forms of Akt in PDK1 knockdown cells is unable to rescue the anchorage-independent growth. In addition, Akt down-regulation and pharmacological inhibition do not inhibit the effects of PDK1 overexpression. In summary, these results suggest that PDK1 may contribute to breast cancer, even in the absence of PI3K oncogenic mutations and through both Akt-dependent and Akt-independent mechanisms.",

Hypoxic regions in solid tumor are spatially heterogeneous. Therefore, delineating the origin and extent of hypoxia in tumors is critical. In this study, we have investigated the effect of hypoxia on different metabolic pathways, such as lipid and choline metabolism, in a human breast cancer model. Human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and tumors, which were genetically engineered to express red fluorescent tdTomato protein under hypoxic conditions, were used to investigate hypoxia. Our data were obtained with a novel three-dimensional multimodal molecular imaging platform that combines magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI), and optical imaging of hypoxia and necrosis. A higher concentration of noninvasively detected total choline-containing metabolites (tCho) and lipid CH3 localized in the tdTomato-fluorescing hypoxic regions indicated that hypoxia can upregulate tCho and lipid CH3 levels in this breast tumor model. The increase in tCho under hypoxia was primarily due to elevated phosphocholine levels as shown by in vitro MR spectroscopy. Elevated lipid CH3 levels detected under hypoxia were caused by an increase in mobile MR-detectable lipid droplets, as demonstrated by Nile Red staining. Our findings demonstrate that noninvasive MRSI can help delineate hypoxic regions in solid tumors by means of detecting the metabolic outcome of tumor hypoxia, which is characterized by elevated tCho and lipid CH3.",

Further understanding is confounded by their genetic, histologic, and clinical heterogeneity, the basis of which remains largely unknown. We evaluated 224 WT for global gene expression patterns; WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX mutation; and 11p15 copy number and methylation patterns. Five subsets were identified showing distinct differences in their pathologic and clinical features: these findings were validated in 100 additional WT. The gene expression pattern of each subset was compared with published gene expression profiles during normal renal development. A novel subset of epithelial WT in infants lacked WT1, CTNNB1, and WTX mutations and nephrogenic rests and displayed a gene expression pattern of the postinduction nephron, and none recurred. Three subsets were characterized by a low expression of WT1 and intralobar nephrogenic rests. These differed in their frequency of WT1 and CTNNB1 mutations, in their age, in their relapse rate, and in their expression similarities with the intermediate mesoderm versus the metanephric mesenchyme. The largest subset was characterized by biallelic methylation of the imprint control region 1, a gene expression profile of the metanephric mesenchyme, and both interlunar and perilobar nephrogenic rests. These data provide a biologic explanation for the clinical and pathologic heterogeneity seen within WT and enable the future development of subset-specific therapeutic strategies. Further, these data support a revision of the current model of WT ontogeny, which allows for an interplay between the type of initiating event and the developmental stage in which it occurs.",

Flt3L induces expansion and recruitment of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) into the brain. Although pDCs can present antigen and produce powerful inflammatory cytokines, that is, interferon \u03b1 (IFN-\u03b1), their role in tumor immunology remains debated. Thus, we studied the role of pDCs and IFN-\u03b1 in Ad.TK/GCV+ Ad.Flt3L-mediated anti-GBM therapeutic efficacy. Our data indicate that the combined gene therapy induced recruitment of plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) into the tumor mass; which were capable of in vivo phagocytosis, IFN-\u03b1 release, and T-cell priming. Thus, we next used either pDCs or an Ad vector encoding IFN-\u03b1 delivered within the tumor microenvironment. When rats were treated with Ad.TK/GCV in combination with pDCs or Ad-IFN-\u03b1, they exhibited 35% and 50% survival, respectively. However, whereas intracranial administration of Ad.TK/GCV + Ad.Flt3L exhibited a high safety profile, Ad-IFN-\u03b1 led to severe local inflammation, with neurologic and systemic adverse effects. To elucidate whether the efficacy of the immunotherapy was dependent on IFN-\u03b1-secreting pDCs, we administered an Ad vector encoding B18R, an IFN-\u03b1 antagonist, which abrogated the antitumoral effect of Ad.TK/GCV + Ad.Flt3L. Our data suggest that IFN-\u03b1 release by activated pDCs plays a critical role in the antitumor effect mediated by Ad.TK/GCV + Ad.Flt3L. In summary, taken together, our results demonstrate that pDCs mediate anti-GBM therapeutic efficacy through the production of IFN-\u03b1, thus manipulation of pDCs constitutes an attractive new therapeutic target for the treatment of GBM.",

Here we show that VA inhibits protein translation initiation culminating in apoptosis through the extrinsic signaling pathway. Reintroduction of the VHL gene in CCRCC cells afforded resistance to VA's apoptotic effects. This resistance is mediated in part by the formation of stress granules that entrap signaling molecules that initiate the apoptotic signaling cascade. The VHL gene product was found to be a component of stress granules that develop as result of VA treatment.

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanistic roles of HOPX-\u03b2 promoter methylation and its clinical relevance in colorectal cancer (CRC). HOPX-\u03b2 promoter methylation was assessed in human CRC cell lines and 294 CRC tissues. HOPX mRNA and protein levels were measured in relation to HOPX-\u03b2 promoter methylation. The effects of forced HOPX expression on tumorigenesis were studied using in vitro and in vivo assays. The association between HOPX-\u03b2 promoter methylation and clinical relevance of CRC patients was determined. HOPX-\u03b2 promoter methylation is cancer-specific and frequently found in CRC cell lines and tissues, resulting in the down-regulation of HOPX mRNA and protein levels. In CRC cell lines, forced expression of HOPX suppressed proliferation, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth. DNA microarray analyses suggested critical downstream genes that are associated with cancer cell proliferation, invasion or angiogenesis. In a mouse xenograft model, HOPX inhibited tumorigenesis and angiogenesis. Finally, HOPX-\u03b2 promoter methylation was associated with worse prognosis of stage III CRC patients (hazard ratio= 1.40, P = .035) and also with poor differentiation (P = .014). In conclusion, HOPX-\u03b2 promoter methylation is a frequent and cancer-specific event in CRC progression. This epigenetic alteration may have clinical ramifications in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC patients.",

     "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematopoietic neoplasm characterized by the Philadelphia chromosome and the related BCR-ABL1 oncoprotein. Acceleration of CML is usually accompanied by basophilia. Several proangiogenic molecules have been implicated in disease acceleration, including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). However, little is known so far about the cellular distribution and function of HGF in CML. We here report that HGF is expressed abundantly in purified CML basophils and in the basophil-committed CML line KU812, whereas all other cell types examined expressed only trace amounts of HGF or no HGF. Interleukin 3, a major regulator of human basophils, was found to promote HGF expression in CML basophils. By contrast, BCR-ABL1 failed to induce HGF synthesis in CML cells, and imatinib failed to inhibit expression of HGF in these cells. Recombinant HGF as well as basophil-derived HGF induced endothelial cell migration in a scratch wound assay, and these effects of HGF were reverted by an anti-HGF antibody as well as by pharmacologic c-Met inhibitors. In addition, anti-HGF and c-Met inhibitors were found to suppress the spontaneous growth of KU812 cells, suggesting autocrine growth regulation. Together, HGF is a BCR-ABL1-independent angiogenic and autocrine growth regulator in CML. Basophils are a unique source of HGF in these patients and may play a more active role in disease-associated angiogenesis and disease progression than has so far been assumed. Our data also suggest that HGF and c-Met are potential therapeutic targets in CML.",

     "abstract": "Heterotrimeric protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) consists of catalytic C (PP2Ac), structural A, and regulatory B-type subunits, and its dysfunction has been linked to cancer. Reversible methylation of PP2Ac by leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT-1) and protein phosphatase methylesterase 1 (PME-1) differentially regulates B-type subunit binding and thus PP2A function. Polyomavirus middle (PyMT) and small (PyST) tumor antigens and SV40 small tumor antigen (SVST) are oncoproteins that block PP2A function by replacing certain B-type subunits, resulting in cellular transformation. Whereas the B-type subunits replaced by these oncoproteins seem to exhibit a binding preference for methylated PP2Ac, PyMT does not. We hypothesize that circumventing the normal cellular control of PP2A by PP2Ac methylation is a general strategy for ST- and MT-mediated transformation. Two predictions of this hypothesis are (1) that PyST and SVST also bind PP2A in a methylation-insensitive manner and (2) that down-regulation of PP2Ac methylation will activate progrowth and prosurvival signaling and promote transformation. We found that SVST and PyST, like PyMT, indeed form PP2A heterotrimers independently of PP2Ac methylation. In addition, reducing PP2Ac methylation through LCMT-1 knockdown or PME-1 overexpression enhanced transformation by activating the Akt and p70/p85 S6 kinase (S6K) pathways, pathways also activated by MT and ST oncoproteins. These results support the hypothesis that MT and ST oncoproteins circumvent cellular control of PP2A by methylation to promote transformation. They also implicate LCMT-1 as a negative regulator of Akt and p70/p85 S6K. Therefore, disruption of PP2Ac methylation may contribute to cancer, and modulation of this methylation may serve as an anticancer target.",

     "abstract": "This work aimed to evaluate whether ETS transcription factors frequently involved in rearrangements in prostate carcinomas (PCa), namely ERG and ETV1, regulate specific or shared target genes. We performed differential expression analysis on nine normal prostate tissues and 50 PCa enriched for different ETS rearrangements using exon-level expression microarrays, followed by in vitro validation using cell line models. We found specific deregulation of 57 genes in ERG-positive PCa and 15 genes in ETV1-positive PCa, whereas deregulation of 27 genes was shared in both tumor subtypes. We further showed that the expression of seven tumor-associated ERG target genes (PLA1A, CACNA1D, ATP8A2, HLA-DMB, PDE3B, TDRD1, and TMBIM1) and two tumor-associated ETV1 target genes (FKBP10 and GLYATL2) was significantly affected by specific ETS silencing in VCaP and LNCaP cell line models, respectively, whereas the expression of three candidate ERG and ETV1 shared targets (GRPR, KCNH8, and TMEM45B) was significantly affected by silencing of either ETS. Interestingly, we demonstrate that the expression of TDRD1, the topmost overexpressed gene of our list of ERG-specific candidate targets, is inversely correlated with the methylation levels of a CpG island found at -66 bp of the transcription start site in PCa and that TDRD1 expression is regulated by direct binding of ERG to the CpG island in VCaP cells. We conclude that ETS transcription factors regulate specific and shared target genes and that TDRD1, FKBP10, and GRPR are promising therapeutic targets and can serve as diagnostic markers for molecular subtypes of PCa harboring specific fusion gene rearrangements.",

Paired human melanoma cell lines WM115 and WM239 were used to investigate differences in expression and functionality of VEGF and VEGFR2 in vitro and in vivo with the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab. Both WM115 and WM239 cells expressed VEGF and VEGFR2, the levels of which were modulated by hypoxia. Detection of native and phosphorylated VEGFR2 in subcellular fractions under serum-free conditions showed the presence of a functional autocrine as well as intracrine VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling loops. Interestingly, treatment of WM115 and WM239 cells with increasing doses of bevacizumab (0\u2013300 \u00b5g/ml) in vitro did not show any significant inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation. Small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib, caused an inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in WM239 but not in WM115 cells. An increase in cell proliferation was observed in WM115 cells treated with bevacizumab, whereas sunitinib inhibited proliferation. When xenografted to immune-deficient mice, we found bevacizumab to be an effective antiangiogenic but not antitumorigenic agent for both cell lines. Because bevacizumab is unable to neutralize murine VEGF, this supports a paracrine angiogenic response. We propose that the failure of bevacizumab to generate an antitumorigenic effect may be related to its generation of enhanced autocrine/intracrine signaling in the cancer cells themselves. Collectively, these results suggest that, for cancers with intracrine VEGF/ VEGFR2 signaling loops, small-molecule inhibitors of VEGFR2 may be more effective than neutralizing antibodies at disease control.",

Here, we attempt to examine the association between COX-2 expression in therapy-refractory CRC, how it affects chemosensitivity, and whether, in primary tumors, it is predictive of clinical outcomes. Our results revealed higher COX-2 expression in chemoresistant CRC cells and tumor xenografts. In vitro, the combination of either aspirin or celecoxib with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was capable of improving chemosensitivity in chemorefractory CRC cells, but a synergistic effect with 5-FU could only be demonstrated with celecoxib. To examine the potential clinical significance of these observations, in vivo studies were undertaken, which also showed that the greatest tumor regression was achieved in chemoresistant xenografts after chemotherapy in combination with celecoxib, but not aspirin. We also noted that these chemoresistant tumors with higher COX-2 expression had a more aggressive growth rate. Given the dramatic response to a combination of celecoxib + 5-FU, the possibility that celecoxib may modulate chemosensitivity as a result of its ability to inhibit MDR-1 was examined. In addition, assessment of a tissue microarray consisting of 130 cases of CRCs revealed that, in humans, higher COX-2 expression was associated with poorer survival with a 68% increased risk of mortality, indicating that COX-2 expression is a marker of poor clinical outcome. The findings of this study point to a potential benefit of combining COX-2 inhibitors with current regimens to achieve better response in the treatment of therapy-refractory CRC and in using COX-2 expression as a prognostic marker to help identify individuals who would benefit the greatest from closer follow-up and more aggressive therapy.",

We investigated whether this polymorphism affects neuroblastoma risk and disease outcome and assessed the biologic effects of the p53-72R and p53-72P isoforms in p53-null cells. Comparison of 288 healthy subjects and 286 neuroblastoma patients revealed that the p53-72 polymorphism had no significant impact on the risk of developing neuroblastoma; however, patients with the Pro/Pro genotype had a shorter survival than those with the Arg/Arg or the Arg/Pro genotypes even in the stage 3 and 4 subgroup without MYCN amplification. By Cox regression analysis, the p53 Pro/Pro genotype seems to be an independent marker of poor prognosis (hazard ratio = 2.74; 95% confidence interval = 1.14\u20136.55, P = .014) together with clinical stage, MYCN status, and age at diagnosis. In vitro, p53-72P was less effective than p53-72R in inducing apoptosis and inhibiting survival of p53-null LAN-1 cells treated with etoposide, topotecan, or ionizing radiation but not taxol. By contrast, p53-72P was more effective in promoting p21-dependent accelerated senescence, alone or in the presence of etoposide. Thus, the p53-72 Pro/Pro genotype might be a marker of poor outcome independent of MYCN amplification, possibly improving risk stratification. Moreover, the lower apoptosis and the enhanced accelerated senescence by the p53-72P isoform in response to DNA damage suggest that patients with neuroblastoma with the p53-72 Pro/Pro genotype may benefit from therapeutic protocols that do not rely only on cytotoxic drugs that function, in part, through p53 activation.",

     "abstract": "While numerous cell signaling pathways are known to play decisive roles in chemotherapeutic response, relatively little is known about the impact of the Smad-dependent transforming growth factor \u03b2 pathway on the therapeutic outcome. Previous reports suggested that patients with lung cancer who continue to smoke while receiving chemotherapy have a poorer outcome than their nonsmoking counterparts do. In our previous study, we showed that long-term cigarette smoke condensate (CSC)-mediated down-regulation of Smad3 induces tumorigenesis. The objective of this study was to determine the mechanism of function of Smad3 in chemoresistance induced by CSC in human lung cell lines, namely, A549 and HPL1A. Long-term CSC treatment increases the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of carboplatin and makes cells resistant to carboplatin. The increase in IC50 of long-term CSC-treated cells is due to the reduced induction in apoptosis by carboplatin. The increase in IC50 and decrease in apoptosis in long-term CSC-treated cells is correlated with the expression of Bcl2. We have determined that Bcl2 is both necessary and sufficient to make the cells resistant to carboplatin. We have also shown that Smad3 acts upstream to regulate the expression of Bcl2 specifically and, thus, sensitivity of the cells to carboplatin. This is supported by the inverse correlation between the expressions of Smad3 and Bcl2 in human lung tumors. Collectively, these data suggest that loss of Smad3 expression in CSC-treated cells induces resistance to carboplatin by upregulating the expression of Bcl2. This study explains, at least in part, the higher chemoresistance rate observed in smokers.",

Overexpression of the Bcl-2 family members, including Mcl-1, in PCa cells is known to inhibit intracellular mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Here we report the development of a novel transgenic mouse model that spontaneously develops prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and adenocarcinoma by the inducible, conditional knockout of transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor type II in stromal fibroblastic cells (Tgfbr2ColTKO). The Tgfbr2ColTKO prostate epithelia demonstrated down-regulation of luminal and basal differentiation markers, as well as Pten expression and up-regulation of Mcl-1. However, unlike in men, Tgfbr2ColTKO prostates exhibited no regression acutely after castration. The administration of Sabutoclax (BI-97C1), a pan-active Bcl-2 protein family antagonist mediated apoptosis in castrate-resistant PCa cells of Tgfbr2ColTKO mice and human subcutaneous, orthotopic, and intratibial xenograft PCa models. Interestingly, Sabutoclax had little apoptotic effect on benign prostate tissue in Tgfbr2ColTKO and wild-type mice. Sabutoclax was able to block c-Met activation, a critical axis in PCa metastatic progression. Further, Sabutoclax synergistically sensitized PC-3 cells to the cytotoxic effects of docetaxel (Taxotere). Together, these data suggest that Sabutoclax inhibits castrate-resistant PCa alone at the primary and bone metastatic site as well as support sensitivity to docetaxel treatment.",

     "abstract": "High-resolution image guidance for resection of residual tumor cells would enable more precise and complete excision for more effective treatment of cancers, such as medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric brain cancer. Numerous studies have shown that brain tumor patient outcomes correlate with the precision of resection. To enable guided resection with molecular specificity and cellular resolution, molecular probes that effectively delineate brain tumor boundaries are essential. Therefore, we developed a bioinformatics approach to analyze micro-array datasets for the identification of transcripts that encode candidate cell surface biomarkers that are highly enriched in medulloblastoma. The results identified 380 genes with greater than a two-fold increase in the expression in the medulloblastoma compared with that in the normal cerebellum. To enrich for targets with accessibility for extracellular molecular probes, we further refined this list by filtering it with gene ontology to identify genes with protein localization on, or within, the plasma membrane. To validate this meta-analysis, the top 10 candidates were evaluated with immunohistochemistry. We identified two targets, fibrillin 2 and EphA3, which specifically stain medulloblastoma. These results demonstrate a novel bioinformatics approach that successfully identified cell surface and extracellular candidate markers enriched in medulloblastoma versus adjacent cerebellum. These two proteins are high-value targets for the development of tumor-specific probes in medulloblastoma. This bioinformatics method has broad utility for the identification of accessible molecular targets in a variety of cancers and will enable probe development for guided resection.",

Identification of new treatments is a high priority, and preclinical studies in mouse models of EOC may expedite this goal. We previously developed methods for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for tumor detection and quantification in a transgenic mouse model of EOC. The goal of this study was to determine whether three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT) and fluorescent molecular imaging probes could be effectively used for in vivo detection of ovarian tumors and response to therapy. Ovarian tumor-bearing TgMISIIR-TAg mice injected with fluorescent probes were subjected to MRI and FMT. Tumor-specific probe retention was identified in vivo by alignment of the 3D data sets, confirmed by ex vivo fluorescent imaging and correlated with histopathologic findings. Mice were treated with standard chemotherapy, and changes in fluorescent probe binding were detected by MRI and FMT. Ovarian tumors were detected using probes specific for cathepsin proteases, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23. Cathepsin and integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 probe activation and retention correlated strongly with tumor volume. MMP probe activation was readily detected in tumors but correlated less strongly with tumor volume. Tumor regression associated with response to therapy was detected and quantified by serial MRI and FMT. These results demonstrate the feasibility and sensitivity of FMT for detection and quantification of tumor-associated biologic targets in ovarian tumors and support the translational utility of molecular imaging to assess functional response to therapy in mouse models of EOC.",

Dasatinib, a bcr-abl inhibitor, has been approved clinically for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and demonstrated to be effective against solid tumors in vitro through Src inhibition. Here, we disclose that EGFR degradation mediated dasatinib-induced apoptosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. HNSCC cells, including Ca9-22, FaDu, HSC3, SAS, SCC-25, and UMSCC1, were treated with dasatinib, and cell viability, apoptosis, and underlying signal transduction were evaluated. Dasatinib exhibited differential sensitivities against HNSCC cells. Growth inhibition and apoptosis were correlated with its inhibition on Akt, Erk, and Bcl-2, irrespective of Src inhibition. Accordingly, we found that down-regulation of EGFR was a determinant of dasatinib sensitivity. Lysosome inhibitor reversed dasatinib-induced EGFR down-regulation, and c-cbl activity was increased by dasatinib, indicating that dasatinib-induced EGFR down-regulation might be through c-cbl-mediated lysosome degradation. Increased EGFR activation by ligand administration rescued cells from dasatinib-induced apoptosis, whereas inhibition of EGFR enhanced its apoptotic effect. Estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) was demonstrated to play a role in Bcl-2 expression, and dasatinib inhibited ER\u03b1 at the pretranslational level. ER\u03b1 was associated with EGFR in dasatinib-treated HNSCC cells. Furthermore, the xenograft model showed that dasatinib inhibited HSC3 tumor growth through in vivo down-regulation of EGFR and ER\u03b1. In conclusion, degradation of EGFR is a novel mechanism responsible for dasatinib-induced apoptosis in HNSCC cells.",

     "abstract": "It is well known that RB functions are regulated by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation, but the significance of lysine methylation on RB has not been fully elucidated. Our expression analysis of SMYD2 by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that expression levels of SMYD2 are significantly elevated in human bladder carcinomas compared with nonneoplastic bladder tissues (P < .0001), and its expression levels in tumor tissues were much higher than those of any other normal tissues. SMYD2 knockdown resulted in the suppression of cancer cell growth, and cell cycle analysis indicated that SMYD2 might play a crucial role in the G1/S transition. According to an in vitro methyltransferase assay, we found that SMYD2 methylates RB1 protein, and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis revealed lysine 810 of RB1 to be methylated by SMYD2. Importantly, this methylation enhanced Ser 807/811 phosphorylation of RB1 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that methylated RB1 accelerates E2F transcriptional activity and promotes cell cycle progression. SMYD2 is an important oncoprotein in various types of cancer, and SMYD2-dependent RB1 methylation at lysine 810 promotes cell cycle progression of cancer cells.

With the aim of providing some further insights into the complex role of the immune system in CKS pathogenesis, we performed an extensive analysis of the TCR BV repertoire in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in 30 human herpesvirus 8-positive Sardinian patients with CKS and an equal number of age-matched healthy controls. We used a panel of monoclonal antibodies covering approximately 70% of human BV subfamilies and third complementarity determining region (CDR3) spectratyping. Patients with CKS showed an increased frequency of BV expansions in both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes, with no prevalent clones. On spectratyping analysis, most of the 720 BV CDR3 profiles obtained from both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in patients with CKS were skewed. In particular, the surprising increase of BV skewing observed in CD4+ lymphocytes mimics the pattern of progressive TCR BV narrowing described in responses to persistent viral antigen stimulations. Our findings support the hypothesis that CKS evolution is associated with inadequate activation rather than impairment of the immune system.",

     "abstract": "The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib is the first oral agent to show activity against human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although the clinical application of sorafenib has shown good tolerability in the studied populations, it also causes multiple human dose-limiting toxicities. Thus, there is a strong need to reduce the overall dose of sorafenib. We have reported that the epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) expression can decrease the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, we sought to explore whether EGFRvIII can affect the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. In this study, we observed that EGFRvIII expression significantly decreased the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. To enhance the antitumor effect and reduce the overall dose of sorafenib, we evaluated the combined effects of CH12, a monoclonal antibody against EGFRvIII, and sorafenib on the growth of HCC cells expressing EGFRvIII in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that, when CH12 was combined with sorafenib, the tumor growth suppression effect was significantly increased, and the concentration of sorafenib required for growth inhibition was substantially reduced. Mechanistically, the combination could more noticeably downregulate the phosphorylation of constitutively active extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), Akt (Thr308), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) than sorafenib alone. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that CH12 interacts additively with sorafenib to strongly inhibit the tumor growth of HCC xenografts expressing EGFRvIII by enhancing the sorafenib-mediated inhibition of the MEK/ERK, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT, and STAT3 pathways.",

We hypothesized that Chk1 inhibition would sensitize pancreatic cancer stem cells to gemcitabine. We tested this hypothesis by using two patient-derived xenograft models (designated J and F) and the pancreatic cancer stem cell markers CD24, CD44, and ESA. We determined the percentage of marker-positive cells and their tumor-initiating capacity (by limiting dilution assays) after treatment with gemcitabine and the Chk1 inhibitor, AZD7762. We found that marker-positive cells were significantly reduced by the combination of gemcitabine and AZD7762. In addition, secondary tumor initiation was significantly delayed in response to primary tumor treatment with gemcitabine + AZD7762 compared with control, gemcitabine, or AZD7762 alone. Furthermore, for the same number of stem cells implanted from gemcitabine- versus gemcitabine + AZD7762-treated primary tumors, secondary tumor initiation at 10 weeks was 83% versus 43%, respectively. We also found that pS345 Chk1, which is a measure of DNA damage, was induced in marker-positive cells but not in the marker-negative cells. These data demonstrate that Chk1 inhibition in combination with gemcitabine reduces both the percentage and the tumor-initiating capacity of pancreatic cancer stem cells. Furthermore, the finding that the Chk1-mediated DNA damage response was greater in stem cells than in non-stem cells suggests that Chk1 inhibition may selectively sensitize pancreatic cancer stem cells to gemcitabine, thus making Chk1 a potential therapeutic target for improving pancreatic cancer therapy.",

In a genome-wide screen, we identified a CpG-rich fragment within the 5\u2032 region of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 11A gene (TNFRSF11A) that showed de novo methylation in gliomas. TNFRSF11A, also known as receptor activator of NF-\u03baB (RANK), activates several signaling pathways, such as NF-\u03baB, JNK, ERK, p38\u03b1, and Akt/PKB. Using pyrosequencing, we detected RANK/TNFRSF11A promoter methylation in 8 (57.1%) of 14 diffuse astrocytomas, 17 (77.3%) of 22 anaplastic astrocytomas, 101 (84.2%) of 120 glioblastomas, 6 (100%) of 6 glioma cell lines, and 7 (100%) of 7 glioma stem cell-enriched glioblastoma primary cultures but not in four normal white matter tissue samples. Treatment of glioma cell lines with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine significantly reduced the methylation level and resulted in increased RANK/TNFRSF11A mRNA expression. Overexpression of RANK/TNFRSF11A in glioblastoma cell lines leads to a significant reduction in focus formation and elevated apoptotic activity after flow cytometric analysis. Reporter assay studies of transfected glioma cells supported these results by showing the activation of signaling pathways associated with regulation of apoptosis. We conclude that RANK/TNFRSF11A is a novel and frequent target for de novo methylation in gliomas, which affects apoptotic activity and focus formation thereby contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of gliomas.",

     "abstract": "Suppressors of cytokine signaling 1 and 3 (SOCS-1 and SOCS-3) are inhibitors of the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) pathway and function in a negative feedback loop during cytokine signaling. Abl transformation is associated with constitutive activation of JAK/STAT-dependent signaling. However, the mechanism by which Abl oncoproteins bypass SOCS inhibitory regulation remains poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that coexpression of Bcr-Abl with SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 results in tyrosine phosphorylation of these SOCS proteins. Interestingly, SOCS-1 is highly tyrosine phosphorylated in one of five primary chronic myelogenous leukemia samples. Bcr-Abl-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 occurs mainly on Tyr 155 and Tyr 204 residues of SOCS-1 and on Tyr 221 residue of SOCS-3. We observed that phosphorylation of these SOCS proteins was associated with their binding to Bcr-Abl. Bcr-Abl-dependent phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 diminished their inhibitory effects on the activation of JAK and STAT5 and thereby enhanced JAK/STAT5 signaling. Strikingly, disrupting the tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 impaired the expression of Bcl-XL protein and sensitized K562 leukemic cells to undergo apoptosis. Moreover, selective mutation of tyrosine phosphorylation sites of SOCS-1 or SOCS-3 significantly blocked Bcr-Abl-mediated tumorigenesis in nude mice and inhibited Bcr-Abl-mediated murine bone marrow transformation. Together, these results reveal a mechanism of how Bcr-Abl may overcome SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 inhibition to constitutively activate the JAK/STAT-dependent signaling, and suggest that Bcr-Abl may critically requires tyrosine phosphorylation of SOCS-1 and SOCS-3 to mediate tumorigenesis when these SOCS proteins are present in cells.",

     "abstract": "The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, integrates both intracellular and extracellular signals and serves as a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival, and autophagy. The mTOR pathway is frequently activated in many human cancers, mainly resulting from alterations in the upstream regulators, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT activation, PTEN loss or dysregulation of mTOR-negative regulators (e.g., TSC1/2), leading to uncontrolled proliferation. Thus, inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways is widely considered as an effective approach for targeted cancer therapy. Recently, we and others found that DEPTOR, a naturally occurring inhibitor of both mTORC1 and mTORC2, was degraded by SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F box proteins) E3 ubiquitin ligase, the founding member of cullin-RING-ligases (CRLs), resulting in mTOR activation and cell proliferation. In addition to DEPTOR, previous studies have demonstrated that several other negative regulators of mTOR pathway are also substrates of CRL/SCF E3s. Thus, targeting CRL/SCF E3s is expected to cause the accumulation of these mTOR signal inhibitors to effectively block the mTOR pathway. In this review, we will discuss mTOR signaling pathway, how DEPTOR regulates mTOR/AKT axis, thus acting as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in some cases, how DEPTOR is ubiquitinated and degraded by SCF\u03b2-TrCP E3, and how MLN4924, a small-molecule indirect inhibitor of CRL/SCF E3 ligases through blocking cullin neddylation, might be useful as a novel approach of mTOR pathway targeting for cancer therapy.",

More importantly, accumulated evidence has implicated that DEPTOR plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of human malignances, which could in part be mediated through its inhibitory role toward mTOR. Furthermore, three independent laboratories including our own have demonstrated that the stability of DEPTOR is controlled by the SCF\u03b2-TrCP E3 ubiquitin ligase and deregulated DEPTOR destruction might contribute to hyperactivation of mTOR in pathologic conditions including cancer. This review discusses the recent literature regarding the function of DEPTOR involved in cell growth, apoptosis, autophagy, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and drug resistance, all of which are associated with the pathogenesis of human cancers.

Accordingly, molecular profiling of biopsies from a patient cohort revealed a four-marker set (EpCAM, HER-2, EGFR, and MUC-1) capable of effectively differentiating cancer cells from normal host cells. Using a point-of-care micro-nuclear magnetic resonance (\u00b5NMR) system, we consequently show that this multimarker combination readily detects individual CTC directly in whole blood without the need for primary purification.

EGFcyt and exon 22\u201323-encoded peptide (EGF22.23) enhanced procathepsin B (procathB) expression and procathB-mediated lysosomal degradation of EGFR/ErbB1 as determined by inhibitors for procathB and the lysosomal ATPase inhibitor BafA1.

Upon small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of endogenously expressed UCH-L1, a similar hyperubiquitinylation phenotype, reduced ErbB1/2 content, and attenuated growth was observed. The exon 23-encoded peptide region of EGFcyt was important for these biologic actions. Structural homology modeling of human EGFcyt showed that this molecular region formed an exposed surface loop.

Inhibition of Plk1 by an adenovirus encoding for a short hairpin RNA against Plk1 or by the small-molecule inhibitor BI 2536 reduced the viability of HCC cell lines and inhibited HCC xenograft progression in nude mice. Treatment of transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b1/c-myc bitransgenic mice with BI 2536 during hepatocarcinogenesis reduced the number of dysplastic foci and of Ki-67-positive cells within the foci, indicating diminished tumorigenesis. In contrast, BI 2536 had no significant effect on HCC progression in the transgenic mouse HCC model as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging. Measurement of BI 2536 by mass spectrometry revealed considerably lower BI 2536 levels in HCC compared with the adjacent normal liver tissue. In conclusion, low intratumoral levels are a novel mechanism of resistance to the Plk1 inhibitor BI 2536. Plk1 inhibitors achieving sufficient intratumoral levels are highly promising in HCC treatment.",

However, molecular agents targeting EGFR have demonstrated minimal efficacy in clinical trials, suggesting the existence of GBM resistance mechanisms. GBM cells with stem-like properties (CSCs) are highly efficient at tumor initiation and exhibit therapeutic resistance. In this study, GBMCSC lines showed sphere-forming and tumor initiation capacity after EGF withdrawal from cell culture media, compared with normal neural stem cells that rapidly perished after EGF withdrawal. Compensatory activation of related ERBB family receptors (ERBB2 and ERBB3) was observed in GBM CSCs deprived of EGFR signal (EGF deprivation or cetuximab inhibition), suggesting an intrinsic GBM resistance mechanism for EGFR-targeted therapy. Dual inhibition of EGFR and ERBB2 with lapatinib significantly reduced GBM proliferation in colony formation assays compared to cetuximab-mediated EGFR-specific inhibition. Phosphorylation of downstream ERBB signaling components (AKT, ERK1/2) and GBM CSC proliferation were inhibited by lapatinib. Collectively, these findings show that GBM therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors may be explained by compensatory activation of EGFR-related family members (ERBB2, ERBB3) enabling GBM CSC proliferation, and therefore simultaneous blockade of multiple ERBB family members may be required for more efficacious GBM therapy.",

     "abstract": "Bone is the preferred metastasis site of advanced prostate cancer (PCa). Using an in vivo murine model of human PCa cell metastasis to bone, we noted that the majority of animals that develop skeletal metastasis have either spinal lesions or lesions in the bones of the hindlimb. Much less frequently, lesions develop in the bones of the forelimb. We therefore speculated whether the environment of the forelimb bones is not permissive for the growth of PCa. Consequently, data on tumor prevalence were normalized to account for the number of PCa cells arriving after intravascular injection, marrow cellularity, and number of hematopoietic stem cell niches. None of these factors were able to account for the observed differences in tumor prevalence. An analysis of differential gene and protein levels identified that growth arrest specific-6 (GAS6) levels were significantly greater in the forelimb versus hindlimb bone marrow. When murine RM1 cells were implanted into subcutaneous spaces in immune competent animals, tumor growth in the GAS6-/- animals was greater than in GAS6+/+ wild-type animals. In an osseous environment, the human PC3 cell line grew significantly better in vertebral body transplants (vossicles) derived from GAS6-/- animals than in vossicles derived from GAS6+/+ animals. Together, these data suggest that the differences in tumor prevalence after intravascular inoculation are a useful model to study the molecular basis of tumor dormancy. Importantly, these data suggest that therapeutic manipulation of GAS6 levels may prove useful as a therapy for metastatic disease.",

     "abstract": "We report that Binder of Arl Two (BART) plays a role in inhibiting cell invasion by regulating the activity of the Rho small guanosine triphosphatase protein Rac1 in pancreatic cancer cells. BART was originally identified as a binding partner of ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2, a small G protein implicated as a regulator of microtubule dynamics and folding. BART interacts with active forms of Rac1, and the BART-Rac1 complex localizes at the leading edges of migrating cancer cells. Suppression of BART increases active Rac1, thereby increasing cell invasion. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells in which BART is stably knocked down with a Rac1 inhibitor decreases invasiveness. Thus, BART-dependent inhibition of cell invasion is likely associated with decreased active Rac1. Suppression of BART induces membrane ruffling and lamellipodial protrusion and increases peripheral actin structures in membrane ruffles at the edges of lamellipodia. The Rac1 inhibitor inhibits the lamellipodia formation that is stimulated by suppression of BART. Our results imply that BART regulates actin-cytoskeleton rearrangements at membrane ruffles through modulation of the activity of Rac1, which, in turn, inhibits pancreatic cancer cell invasion.",

     "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in the United States. Most cases are diagnosed at late stages, with the solid tumor masses growing as peritoneal implants, or floating within the ascitic fluid (peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis). Despite aggressive surgical \u201cdebulking,\u201d recurrence of recalcitrant disease is frequent with poor patient survival. Efforts to improve survival rates are hindered by lack of biomarkers that can detect and effectively treat ovarian cancer in its early stages. Urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a multifunctional receptor involved in a myriad of tumor cell processes. However, the role of host uPAR in ovarian cancer is still elusive. To define the potential proinflammatory role of uPAR in ovarian cancer, first, using a syngeneic murine model in uPAR-/- mice, we found that ablation of uPAR restrained tumor take and peritoneal implants and prolonged the survival of uPAR-/- mice compared with their uPAR+/+ counterparts. Ascitic fluid accumulation was significantly decreased in uPAR-/- mice with decreased macrophage infiltration. Second, in vitro mechanistic studies revealed that host uPAR is involved in the multiple steps of peritoneal metastatic cascade. Third, we evaluated the prognostic utility of tumor and stromal uPAR in human ovarian cancer tissue microarray. In summary, our studies indicated that uPAR plays a significant role in ovarian cancer cell-stromal crosstalk and contributes to increased vascular permeability and inflammatory ovarian cancer microenvironment. This provides a rationale for targeting the uPAR with either specific neutralizing antibodies or targeting its downstream inflammatory effectors in patients with ovarian cancer.",

     "abstract": "Furin, one of the members of the family of proprotein convertases (PCs), ubiquitously expressed as a type I membrane-bound proteinase, activates several proteins that contribute to tumor progression. In vitro studies using cancer cell lines and clinical specimens demonstrated that furin processes important substrates such as insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) and transforming growth factor \u03b2, leading to increased tumor growth and progression. Despite the numerous studies associating furin with tumor development, its effects in preclinical models has not been comprehensively studied. In this study, we sought to determine the protumorigenic role of furin in vivo after a two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol in transgenic mice in which furin expression was targeted to the epidermal basal layer. We found that processing of the PC substrate IGF-1R and the proliferation rate of mouse epidermis was enhanced in transgenic mice when compared with their WT counterparts. Histopathologic diagnoses of the tumors demonstrated that furin transgenic mice (line F47) developed twice as many squamous carcinomas as the control, WT mice (P < .002). Similarly, tumors cells from transgenic mice were able to process PC substrates more efficiently than tumor cells from WT mice. Furthermore, furin expression resulted in a higher SCC volume in transgenic mice as well as an increase in the percentage of high-grade SCC, including poorly differentiated and spindle cell carcinomas. In conclusion, expression of furin in the basal layer of the epidermis increased tumor development and enhanced tumor growth, supporting the consideration of furin as a potential target for cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Molecular apocrine is a subtype of estrogen receptor-negative (ER.) breast cancer, which is characterized by a steroid-response gene signature that includes androgen receptor, FOXA1, and a high frequency of ErbB2 overexpression. In this study, we demonstrate that there is a strong association between the overexpression of FOXA1 and ErbB2 in ER- breast tumors. This has led us to identify a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling in ER- breast cancer. We present two mechanisms to explain the association between FOXA1 and ErbB2 overexpression in molecular apocrine cells. In one process, ErbB2 signaling genes CREB1 and c-Fos regulate FOXA1 transcription, and in another process, AP2\u03b1 regulates the expression of both FOXA1 and ErbB2. Moreover, we demonstrate that FOXA1, in turn, regulates the transcription of ErbB2 signaling genes. This includes a core gene signature that is shared across two molecular apocrine cell lines. Importantly, the most upregulated (RELB) and downregulated (PAK1) genes in this signature are direct FOXA1 targets. Our data suggest that FOXA1 acts as a dual-function transcription factor and the repressive function of FOXA1 on RELB can be explained by the recruitment of its binding partner corepressor TLE3. It is notable that a group of FOXA1-regulated genes vary across molecular apocrine cell lines leading to the differences in the functional effects of FOXA1 on extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation and cell viability between these lines. This study demonstrates that there is a cross-regulation network between FOXA1 and ErbB2 signaling that connects FOXA1 to some of the key signaling pathways in ER- breast cancer.",

These studies have suggested that Ezrin contributes to the survival of cancer cells after their arrival at secondary metastatic locations. To better understand this role in metastasis, we undertook two noncandidate analyses of Ezrin function including a microarray subtraction of high-and low-Ezrin-expressing cells and a proteomic approach to identify proteins that bound the N-terminus of Ezrin in tumor lysates. Functional analyses of these data led to a novel and unifying hypothesis that Ezrin contributes to the efficiency of metastasis through regulation of protein translation. In support of this hypothesis, we found Ezrin to be part of the ribonucleoprotein complex to facilitate the expression of complex messenger RNA in cells and to bind with poly A binding protein 1 (PABP1; PABPC1). The relevance of these findings was supported by our identification of Ezrin and components of the translational machinery in pseudopodia of highly metastatic cells during the process of cell invasion. Finally, two small molecule inhibitors recently shown to inhibit the Ezrin metastatic phenotype disrupted the Ezrin/PABP1 association. Taken together, these results provide a novel mechanistic basis by which Ezrin may contribute to metastasis.",

Previous studies revealed that, by modulating membrane cholesterol content, statins could induce conformational changes in cluster of differentiation 20 (CD20) tetraspanin. The aim of the presented study was to investigate the influence of statins on glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1)-mediated glucose uptake in tumor cells. We observed a significant concentration- and time-dependent decrease in glucose analogs' uptake in several tumor cell lines incubated with statins. This effect was reversible with restitution of cholesterol synthesis pathway with mevalonic acid as well as with supplementation of plasma membrane with exogenous cholesterol. Statins did not change overall GLUT1 expression at neither transcriptional nor protein levels. An exploratory clinical trial revealed that statin treatment decreased glucose uptake in peripheral blood leukocytes and lowered 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake by tumor masses in a mantle cell lymphoma patient. A bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the structure of human GLUT1 and to identify putative cholesterol-binding motifs in its juxtamembrane fragment. Altogether, the influence of statins on glucose uptake seems to be of clinical significance. By inhibiting 18F-FDG uptake, statins can negatively affect the sensitivity of positron emission tomography, a diagnostic procedure frequently used in oncology.",

Using a novel quantitative method, we characterize the influence of the tumor microenvironment on repopulation of surviving cells in human tumor xenografts after paclitaxel treatment and evaluate the potential of gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, to inhibit repopulation. Methods: High-EGFR-expressing A431 xenografts and low-EGFR-expressing MCF-7 xenografts were treated with paclitaxel or gefitinib. Time-dependent changes in cell proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3) in relation to total and functional tumor blood vessels (recognized by CD31 and a flow marker), and regions of hypoxia (recognized by EF5) were quantified using fluorescence microscopy. Results: Decrease in functional tumor vasculature and in cell proliferation and increase in apoptosis were observed in A431 xenografts after treatment with either paclitaxel or gefitinib. There was a rebound in functional vasculature and cell proliferation \u223c12 days after treatment with paclitaxel, and repopulation was observed from tumor cells close to regions of hypoxia. Cell proliferation increased \u223c5 days after the last dose of gefitinib. There were minimal effects of paclitaxel or gefitinib on cell proliferation, cell death, or tumor vasculature in MCF-7 xenografts. Conclusions: Repopulation in A431 xenografts after treatment with paclitaxel was associated with changes in functional tumor vasculature. Gefitinib decreased cell proliferation in EGFR-overexpressing tumor xenografts, suggesting its potential to inhibit repopulation when used in sequence with chemotherapy.",

We determined whether recombinant human apolipoprotein(a) kringle V, rhLK8, produces therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic human prostate cancer animal model. Fifty thousand androgen-independent human prostate cancer cells (PC-3MM2) were injected into the prostate of nude mice. After 3 days, these mice were randomized to receive the vehicle solution (intraperitoneally [i.p.], daily), paclitaxel (8 mg/kg i.p., weekly), rhLK8 (50 mg/kg i.p., daily), or a combination of paclitaxel and rhLK8 for 4 weeks. Treatment with paclitaxel or rhLK8 alone did not show significant therapeutic effects on tumor incidence or on tumor size compared with the control group. The combination of rhLK8 and paclitaxel significantly reduced tumor size and incidence of lymph node metastasis. Significant reduction in microvessel density and cellular proliferation and induction of apoptosis of tumor cells, and tumor-associated endothelial cells, were also achieved. Similarly, PC-3MM2 tumors growing in the tibia showed significant suppression of tumor growth and lymph node metastasis by the combination treatment with rhLK8 and paclitaxel. The integrity of the bone was significantly preserved, and apoptosis of tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells was increased. In conclusion, these results suggest that targeting the tumor microenvironment with the antivascular effect of rhLK8 combined with conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy could be a new and effective approach in the treatment of androgen-independent prostate cancer and their metastases.",

Chemotherapy is given postoperatively to prevent relapses; however, this approach has had marginal success. After surgery, recurrent tumors depend on rapid neovascular proliferation to deliver nutrients and oxygen. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is exposed on the vascular endothelial cells in the tumor microenvironment but is notably absent on blood vessels in normal tissues. Thus, PS is an attractive target for cancer therapy after surgery. Syngeneic mice bearing TC1 lung cancer tumors were treated with mch1N11 (a novel mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets PS), cisplatin (cis), or combination after surgery. Tumor relapses and disease progression were decreased 90% by combination therapy compared with a 50% response rate for cis alone (P = .02). Mice receiving postoperative mch1N11 had no wound-related complications or added systemic toxicity in comparison to control animals. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that the effects of mch1N11 were associated with a dense infiltration of inflammatory cells, particularly granulocytes. This strategy was independent of the adaptive immune system. Together, these data suggest that vascular-targeted strategies directed against exposed PS may be a powerful adjunct to postoperative chemotherapy in preventing relapses after cancer surgery.",

However, most PCa and PCa cell lines depend on the activity of the AR, and the role of NF-\u03baB in these AR-expressing PCa remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that inhibition of NF-\u03baB signaling by the IKK inhibitor BMS345541 reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis in AR-expressing PCa cell lines. Furthermore, AR activity and target gene expression were distinctively reduced, whereas AR protein levels remained unaltered on BMS345541 treatment. Similar effects were observed particularly after small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of IKK1, but not by siRNA-mediated suppression of IKK2. Moreover, IKK1 overexpression augmented 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone-induced nuclear AR translocation, whereas nuclear AR was reduced by IKK1 knockdown or BMS345541. However, because IKK1 also enhances the activity of a chronically nuclear AR mutant, modulation of the subcellular distribution seems not to be the only mechanism by which IKK1 enhances AR activity. Finally, reduced in vivo AR phosphorylation after BMS345541 treatment and in vitro AR phosphorylation by IKK1 or IKK2 imply that AR constitutes a novel IKK target.

Here, we established isogenic cell line models to systematically investigate the impact of KRASG12V on tumor growth in mouse A431 xenograft models as well as on various modes of action triggered by EGFR-Abs in vitro. KRASG12V impaired EGFR-Ab-mediated growth inhibition by stimulating receptor-independent downstream signaling. KRASG12V also rendered tumor cells less responsive to Fc-mediated effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs\u2014such as complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and Ab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Impaired CDC and ADCC activities could be linked to reduced EGFR expression in KRAS-mutated versus wild-type (wt) cells, which was restored by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of KRAS4b. Immunohistochemistry experiments also revealed lower EGFR expression in KRAS-mutated versus KRAS-wt harboring CRC samples.

Additional experiments suggested the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family to be implicated in the regulation of EGFR promoter activity in KRAS-mutated tumor cells by suppressing EGFR transcription through up-regulation of the inhibitory family member C/EBP\u03b2-LIP. Thus, siRNA-mediated knockdown of C/EBP\u03b2 led to enhanced EGFR expression and Ab-mediated cytotoxicity against KRAS-mutated cells. Together, these results demonstrate that KRASG12V signaling induced C/EBP\u03b2-dependent suppression of EGFR expression, thereby impairing Fc-mediated effector mechanisms of EGFR-Abs and rendering KRAS-mutated tumor cells less sensitive to these therapeutic agents.",

We used high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (Affymetrix SNP 6.0) to detect copy number alterations (CNAs) and copy-neutral losses of heterozygosity (cnLOH) in 15 cortisol-secreting adrenocortical adenomas with matched blood samples. We focused on microalterations aiming to discover new candidate genes involved in early tumorigenesis and/or autonomous cortisol secretion. We identified 962 CNAs with a median of 18 CNAs per sample. Half of them involved noncoding regions, 89% were less than 100 kb, and 28% were found in at least two samples. The most frequently gained regions were 5p15.33, 6q16.1, 7p22.3-22.2, 8q24.3, 9q34.2-34.3, 11p15.5, 11q11, 12q12, 16q24.3, 20p11.1-20q21.11, and Xq28 (\u226520% of cases), most of them being identified in the same three adenomas. These regions contained among others genes like NOTCH1, CYP11B2, HRAS, and IGF2. Recurrent losses were less common and smaller than gains, being mostly localized at 1p, 6q, and 11q. Pathway analysis revealed that Notch signaling was the most frequently altered. We identified 46 recurrent CNAs that each affected a single gene (31 gains and 15 losses), including genes involved in steroidogenesis (CYP11B1) or tumorigenesis (CTNNB1, EPHA7, SGK1, STIL, FHIT). Finally, 20 small cnLOH in four cases affecting 15 known genes were found. Our findings provide the first high-resolution genome-wide view of chromosomal changes in cortisol-secreting adenomas and identify novel candidate genes, such as HRAS, EPHA7, and SGK1. Furthermore, they implicate that the Notch1 signaling pathway might be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of adrenocortical tumors.",

Recent studies have indicated that netrin-4 also participates in the development of nonneural tissues and modulates tumor cell proliferation and tumor metastasis. Here we have explored the functions and molecular mechanisms of netrin-4 in glioblastoma multiforme. The suppression of netrin-4 expression in glioblastoma cell lines significantly reduced cell proliferation and motility and increased serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. Using tandem affinity purification combined with protein identification by mass spectrometry, we found that integrin \u03b24 interacts with netrin-4 and that it mediates mitogenic effects as well as AKT and mammalian target of rapamycin phosphorylation induced by netrin-4. Interestingly, netrin-4 acted as an inhibitor of cell proliferation in integrin \u03b24-silenced glioblastoma cells, and high concentrations of netrin-4 reduced cell proliferation. The negative effects of netrin-4 on proliferation were mediated by UNC5B. Analysis of more than 400 primary tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas repository revealed that the expression of netrin-4 is significantly downregulated in glioblastoma and that the reduced expression is linked to poor patient survival time. The expression of integrin \u03b24 is increased in glioblastoma, and it predicts poor patient survival time. Current results illustrate a novel mechanism for glioma progression, where glioma cells reduce netrin-4 expression to decrease its inhibitory effects. In parallel, the expression of integrin \u03b24 is upregulated to sensitize the cells to low concentrations of netrin-4 for maintaining cell proliferation.",

Expression of a rapamycin-resistant and kinase-active mTOR (S2035T, mTOR-T), but not a rapamycin-resistant and kinase-dead mTOR (S2035T/D2357E, mTOR-TE), conferred resistance to rapamycin inhibition of LEC tube formation, suggesting that rapamycin inhibition of LEC tube formation is mTOR kinase activity dependent. Also, rapamycin inhibited proliferation and motility in the LECs. Furthermore, we found that rapamycin inhibited protein expression of VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR-3) by inhibiting protein synthesis and promoting protein degradation of VEGFR-3 in the cells. Down-regulation of VEGFR-3 mimicked the effect of rapamycin, inhibiting IGF-1- or FBS-stimulated tube formation, whereas over-expression of VEGFR-3 conferred high resistance to rapamycin inhibition of LEC tube formation.

     "abstract": "Drosha is a key enzyme in microRNA biogenesis, generating the precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA) by excising the stem-loop embedded in the primary transcripts (pri-miRNA). The specificity for the pri-miRNAs and determination of the cleavage site are provided by its binding partner DGCR8, which is necessary for efficient processing. The crucial Drosha domains for pri-miRNA cleavage are the middle part, the two enzymatic RNase III domains (RIIID), and the dsRNA binding domain (dsRBD) in the C-terminus. Here, we identify alternatively spliced transcripts in human melanoma and NT2 cell lines, encoding C-terminally truncated Drosha proteins lacking part of the RIIIDb and the entire dsRBD. Proteins generated from these alternative splice variants fail to bind to DGCR8 but still interact with Ewing sarcoma protein (EWS). In vitro as well as in vivo, the Drosha splice variants are deficient in pri-miRNA processing. However, the aberrant transcripts in melanoma cells do not consistently reduce mature miRNA levels compared with melanoma cell lines lacking those splice variants, possibly owing to their limited abundance. Our findings show that alternative processing-deficient Drosha splice variants exist in melanoma cells. In elevated amounts, these alternatively spliced transcripts could provide one potential mechanism accounting for the deregulation of miRNAs in cancer cells. On the basis of our results, the search for alternative inactive splice variants might be fruitful in different tumor entities to unravel the molecular basis of the previously observed decreased microRNA processing efficiency in cancer.",

We report herein on a recurrent feature of high compared to low metastatic cells that is linked to their ability to survive early after their arrival at secondary sites. Using novel fluorescent-based imaging strategies that assess tumor cell interaction with the lung microenvironment, we have determined that most high and low metastatic cells can be distinguished within 6 hours of their arrival in the lung and further that this difference is defined by the ability of high metastatic cells to resist apoptosis at the secondary site. Despite the complexity of the metastatic cascade, the performance of cells during this critical window is highly defining of their metastatic proclivity. To explore mechanisms, we next evaluated biochemical pathways that may be linked to this survival phenotype in highly metastatic cells. Interestingly, we found no association between the Akt survival pathway and this metastatic phenotype. Of all pathways examined, only protein kinase C (PKC) activation was significantly linked to survival of highly metastatic cells. These data provide a conceptual understanding of a defining difference between high and low metastatic cells. The connection to PKC activation may provide a biologic rationale for the use of PKC inhibition in the prevention of metastatic progression.",

Patients with NF2 develop hallmark schwannomas that require surgery or radiation, both of which have significant adverse effects. Recent studies have indicated that the tumor microenvironment\u2014in particular, tumor blood vessels\u2014of schwannomas may be an important therapeutic target. Furthermore, although much has been done to understand how merlin, the NF2 gene product, functions as a tumor suppressor gene in schwannoma cells, the functional role of merlin in the tumor microenvironment and the mechanism(s) by which merlin regulates angiogenesis to support schwannoma growth is largely unexplored. Here we report that the expression of semaphorin 3F (SEMA3F) was specifically downregulated in schwannoma cells lacking merlin/NF2. When we reintroduced SEMA3F in schwannoma cells, we observed normalized tumor blood vessels, reduced tumor burden, and extended survival in nude mice bearing merlin-deficient brain tumors. Next, using chemical inhibitors and gene knockdown with RNA interference, we found that merlin regulated expression of SEMA3F through Rho GTPase family member Rac1. This study shows that, in addition to the tumor-suppressing activity of merlin, it also functions to maintain physiological angiogenesis in the nervous system by regulating antiangiogenic factors such as SEMA3F. Restoring the relative balance of proangiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, such as increases in SEMA3F, in schwannoma microenvironment may represent a novel strategy to alleviate the clinical symptoms of NF2-related schwannomas.",

With the function of C4.4A still unknown, we explored the impact of hypoxia on C4.4A expression and functional activity. Metastatic rat and human tumor lines upregulate C4.4A expression when cultured in the presence of CoCl2. Although hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) becomes upregulated concomitantly, HIF-1\u03b1 did not induce C4.4A transcription. Instead, hypoxia-induced C4.4A up-regulation promoted in vivo and in vitro wound healing, where increased migration on the C4.4A ligands laminin-111 and -332 was observed after a transient period of pronounced binding. Increased migration was accompanied by C4.4A associating with \u03b16\u03b24, MT1-MMP1, and TACE and by laminin fragmentation. Hypoxia also promoted the release of C4.4A in exosomes and TACE-mediated C4.4A shedding.

Hypoxia-induced recruitment of \u03b16\u03b24 toward raft-located C4.4A, MT1-MMP, and TACE allows for a shift from adhesion to motility, which is supported by laminin degradation.

To elucidate mechanisms leading to p130Cas up-regulation in mammary carcinomas and during acquired tamoxifen resistance, the regulation of p130Cas/BCAR1 was studied. Because multiple putative binding motifs for the inducible transcription factor EGR1 were identified in the 5\u2032 region of BCAR1, the p130Cas/BCAR1 regulation by EGR1 and its coregulator NAB2 was investigated. Overexpression or short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated down-regulation of EGR1 or NAB2, and chromatin immunoprecipitations indicated that EGR1 and NAB2 act in concert to positively regulate p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in breast cancer cells. p130Cas depletion using siRNA showed that, in tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 cells, p130Cas regulates EGR1 and NAB2 expression, whereas in the derivative tamoxifen-resistant TAM-R cells, only NAB2 levels were influenced. BCAR1 messenger RNA and p130Cas protein were upregulated by phorbol esters following the kinetics of late response genes in MCF-7 but not in TAM-R cells. Thus, in MCF-7 cells, we identified a positive feedback loop where p130Cas positively regulates EGR1 and NAB2, which in turn induce p130Cas expression. Importantly, compared with MCF-7, enhanced NAB2 expression and increased EGR1 binding to the BCAR1 5\u2032 region observed in TAM-R may lead to the constitutively increased p130Cas/BCAR1 levels in TAM-R cells.

The effects on tumor growth and animal survival of the three therapies were assessed in nude mice xenografted with the human pancreatic carcinoma cell lines Capan-1 and BxPC-3. After therapy, EGFR and HER2 expression and AKT phosphorylation in tumor cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis. EGFR/HER2 heterodimerization was quantified in BxPC-3 cells by time-resolved FRET. In K-ras-mutated Capan-1 xenografts, the 2mAbs therapy gave significantly higher inhibition of tumor growth than the erlotinib/trastuzumab combination, whereas in BxPC-3 (wild-type K-ras) xenografts, the erlotinib/trastuzumab combination showed similar growth inhibition but fewer tumor-free mice. Lapatinib showed no antitumor effect in both types of xenografts. The efficacy of the 2mAbs therapy was partly Fc-independent because F(ab\u2032)2 fragments of the two mAbs significantly inhibited BxPC-3 growth, although with a time-limited therapeutic effect. The 2mAbs therapy was associated with a reduction of EGFR and HER2 expression and AKT phosphorylation. BxPC-3 cells preincubated with the two mAbs showed 50% less EGFR/HER2 heterodimers than controls. In pancreatic carcinoma xenografts, the 2mAbs therapy is more effective than treatments involving dual EGFR/HER2 TKIs.

Human angiosarcomas from diverse sites were shown to be universally immunoreactive for Tie2. Tie2 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) antagonists inhibited SVR and MS1-VEGF angiosarcoma cell survival in vitro. In the high-grade SVR cell line, Tie2 and VEGF antagonists inhibited cell survival synergistically, whereas effects were largely additive in the low-grade MS1-VEGF cell line. Xenograft modeling using these cell lines closely recapitulated the human disease. In vivo, Tie2 and VEGFR inhibition resulted in significant angiosarcoma growth delay. The combination proved more effective than either agent alone. Tie2 inhibition seemed to elicit tumor growth delay through increased tumor cell apoptosis, whereas VEGFR inhibition reduced tumor growth by lowering tumor cell proliferation.

Activated p53 protein regulates its downstream genes and subsequently inhibits malignant transformation by inducing cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and senescence.

Through the screening of two genome-wide expression profile data sets, one for cells in which exogenous p53 was introduced and the other for senescent fibroblasts, we have identified chloride channel accessory 2 (CLCA2) as a p53-inducible senescence-associated gene. CLCA2 was remarkably induced by replicative senescence as well as oxidative stress in a p53-dependent manner. We also found that ectopically expressed CLCA2 induced cellular senescence, and the down-regulation of CLCA2 by small interfering RNA caused inhibition of oxidative stress-induced senescence. Interestingly, the reduced expression of CLCA2 was frequently observed in various kinds of cancers including prostate cancer, whereas its expression was not affected in precancerous prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia. Thus, our findings suggest a crucial role of p53/CLCA2-mediated senescence induction as a barrier for malignant transformation.",

As a measure of radioresponse determined at the individual cell level, \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci were quantified in CD133+ cells and their differentiated (CD133-) progeny. Under in vitro conditions, no difference was detected between CD133+ and CD133- cells in foci induction or dispersal after irradiation. However, irradiation of orthotopic xenografts initiated from TSCs resulted in the induction of fewer \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1 foci in CD133+ cells compared to their CD133- counterparts within the same tumor. Xenograft irradiation resulted in a tumor growth delay of approximately 7 days with a corresponding increase in the percentage of CD133+ cells at 7 days after radiation, which persisted to the onset of neurologic symptoms. These results suggest that, although the radioresponse of TSCs and non-TSCs does not differ under in vitro growth conditions, CD133+ cells are relatively radioresistant under intracerebral growth conditions. Whereas these findings are consistent with the suspected role for TSCs as a determinant of GBM radioresistance, these data also illustrate the dependence of the cellular radioresistance on the brain microenvironment.",

Also, significant inhibition (50%\u2013100%) of colonic tumor formation was observed in both male and female mice with bexarotene treatment. Administration of 200 ppm of bexarotene showed significant suppression of tumor formation (66%, P < .0001); however, it had significant toxicity. Intestinal tumors of bexarotene-fed mice showed significantly reduced expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (60%, P < .0001), cyclin D1, and cyclooxygenase 2 and increased RXR-\u03b1 messenger RNA and uptake of oleate (34%, P < .01). Also, bexarotene-fed mice showed dose-dependent suppression of serum triglycerides (25%\u201372%, P < .0001) and inflammatory cytokines.",

     "abstract": "The chemokine CCL5 (RANTES) plays active promalignancy roles in breast malignancy. The secretion of CCL5 by breast tumor cells is an important step in its tumor-promoting activities; therefore, inhibition of CCL5 secretion may have antitumorigenic effects. We demonstrate that, in breast tumor cells, CCL5 secretion necessitated the trafficking of CCL5-containing vesicles on microtubules from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the post-Golgi stage, and CCL5 release was regulated by the rigidity of the actin cytoskeleton. Focusing on the 40s loop of CCL5, we found that the 43TRKN46 sequence of CCL5 was indispensable for its inclusion in motile vesicles, and for its secretion. The TRKN-mutated chemokine reached the Golgi, but trafficked along the ER-to-post-Golgi route differently than the wild-type (WT) chemokine. Based on the studies showing that the 40s loop of CCL5 mediates its binding to glycosaminoglycans (GAG), we analyzed the roles of GAG in regulating CCL5 secretion. TRKN-mutated CCL5 had lower propensity for colocalization with GAG in the Golgi compared to the WT chemokine. Secretion of WT CCL5 was significantly reduced in CHO mutant cells deficient in GAG synthesis, and the WT chemokine acquired an ER-like distribution in these cells, similar to that of TRKN-mutated CCL5 in GAG-expressing cells. The release of WT CCL5 was also reduced after inhibition of GAG presence/synthesis by intracellular expression of heparanase, inhibition of GAG sulfation, and sulfate deprivation. The need for a 43TRKN46 motif and for a GAG-mediated process in CCL5 secretion may enable the future design of modalities that prevent CCL5 release by breast tumor cells.",

     "abstract": "Mutations of the NF2 gene on chromosome 22q are thought to initiate tumorigenesis in nearly 50% of meningiomas, and 22q deletion is the earliest and most frequent large-scale chromosomal abnormality observed in these tumors. In aggressive meningiomas, 22q deletions are generally accompanied by the presence of large-scale segmental abnormalities involving other chromosomes, but the reasons for this association are unknown. We find that large-scale chromosomal alterations accumulate during meningioma progression primarily in tumors harboring 22q deletions, suggesting 22q-associated chromosomal instability. Here we show frequent codeletion of the DNA repair and tumor suppressor gene, CHEK2, in combination with NF2 on chromosome 22q in a majority of aggressive meningiomas. In addition, tumor-specific splicing of CHEK2 in meningioma leads to decreased functional Chk2 protein expression. We show that enforced Chk2 knockdown in meningioma cells decreases DNA repair. Furthermore, Chk2 depletion increases centrosome amplification, thereby promoting chromosomal instability. Taken together, these data indicate that alternative splicing and frequent codeletion of CHEK2 and NF2 contribute to the genomic instability and associated development of aggressive biologic behavior in meningiomas.",

However, the invasive procedure limits the utility of tumor tissue for epidemiological studies. While recent data indicate that cell-free circulating DNAm (cfDNAm) profiles reflect DNAm status in corresponding tumor tissues, no studies have examined the association of cfDNAm with cancer or precursors on a genome-wide scale. The objective of this pilot study was to evaluate the putative significance of genome-wide cfDNAm profiles in esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and Barrett esophagus (BE, EA precursor). We performed genome-wide DNAm profiling in EA tissue DNA (n = 8) and matched serum DNA (n = 8), in serum DNA of BE (n = 10), and in healthy controls (n = 10) using the Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip that covers 27,578 CpG loci in 14,495 genes. We found that cfDNAm profiles were highly correlated to DNAm profiles in matched tumor tissue DNA (r = 0.92) in patients with EA. We selected the most differentially methylated loci to perform hierarchical clustering analysis. We found that 911 loci can discriminate perfectly between EA and control samples, 554 loci can separate EA from BE samples, and 46 loci can distinguish BE from control samples. These results suggest that genome-wide cfDNAm profiles are highly consistent with DNAm profiles detected in corresponding tumor tissues. Differential cfDNAm profiling may be a useful approach for the noninvasive screening of EA and EA premalignant lesions.",

     "abstract": "Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signaling are being actively developed for tumor therapy owing to the frequent mutational activation of the PI3K-Akt-mTORC1 pathway in many cancers, including glioblastomas (GBMs). NVP-BEZ235 is a novel and potent dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor that is currently in phase 1/2 clinical trials for advanced solid tumors. Here, we show that NVP-BEZ235 also potently inhibits ATM and DNA-PKcs, the two major kinases responding to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Consequently, NVP-BEZ235 blocks both nonhomologous end joining and homologous recombination DNA repair pathways resulting in significant attenuation of DSB repair. In addition, phosphorylation of ATMtargets and implementation of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint are also attenuated by this drug. As a result, NVP-BEZ235 confers an extreme degree of radiosensitization and impairs DSB repair in a panel of GBM cell lines irrespective of their Akt activation status. NVP-BEZ235 also significantly impairs DSB repair in a mouse tumor model thereby validating the efficacy of this drug as a DNA repair inhibitor in vivo. Our results, showing that NVP-BEZ235 is a potent and novel inhibitor of ATM and DNA-PKcs, have important implications for the informed and rational design of clinical trials involving this drug and also reveal the potential utility of NVP-BEZ235 as an effective radiosensitizer for GBMs in the clinic.",

It is known that antiviral reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) such as azidothymidine (AZT) and didanosine (ddI) lead to telomere shortening at high, potentially toxic concentrations. We hypothesized that those drugs might have synergistic effects enabling successful therapy with low, nontoxic concentrations. Biologic effects of AZT and ddI were analyzed at concentrations that correspond to minimal plasma levels achieved during human immunodeficiency virus therapy. Long-term coapplication of low-dose AZT and ddI induced a significant shortening of telomeres in the tumor cell lines HCT-116, SkMel-28, MelJuso, and Jurkat. Treatment of cells with both RTI, but not with single RTI, led to a significant accumulation of \u03b3H2AX, to p53 phosphorylation, and to cell apoptosis in all cell lines. Oral low-dose dual RTI application but not low-dose single RTI application was associated with a significantly reduced tumor growth of HCT-116 cells in mice.

Activated STAT3 promotes the transcription of factors that enhance tumor growth, survival, and angiogenesis.

This study examined the use of diffusion-weighted (DW) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers in assessing early tumor response to AZD1480. Cediranib (AZD2171), a vascular endothelial growth factor signaling inhibitor, was used as a comparator. Thirty mice were injected with Calu-6 lung cancer cells and randomized into the three treatment groups: AZD1480, cediranib, and sham. DW-MRI and DCE-MRI protocols were performed at baseline and at days 3 and 5 after treatment. The percent change from baseline measurements for Ktrans, ADC, and ve were calculated and compared with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), CD31, cParp, and Ki-67 histology data. Decreases in Ktrans of 29% (P < .05) and 53% (P < .05) were observed at days 3 and 5, respectively, for the cediranib group. No significant changes in Ktrans occurred for the AZD1480 group, but a significant increase in ADC was demonstrated at days 3 (63%, P < .05) and 5 (49%, P < .05). CD31 staining indicated diminished vasculature in the cediranib group, whereas significantly increased cParp staining for apoptotic activity and extracellular space by image analysis of H&E were present in the AZD1480 group.

     "abstract": "Currently incurable, prostate cancer metastasis has a remarkable ability to spread to the skeleton. Previous studies demonstrated that interactions mediated by the cancer-associated Thomsen-Friedenreich glycoantigen (TF-Ag) and the carbohydrate-binding protein galectin-3 play an important role in several rate-limiting steps of cancer metastasis such as metastatic cell adhesion to bone marrow endothelium, homotypic tumor cell aggregation, and clonogenic survival and growth. This study investigated the ability of a synthetic small-molecular-weight nontoxic carbohydrate-based TF-Ag mimic lactulose-l-leucine (Lac-l-Leu) to inhibit these processes in vitro and, ultimately, prostate cancer bone metastasis in vivo. Using an in vivo mouse model, based on intracardiac injection of human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cells stably expressing luciferase, we investigated the ability of Lac-l-Leu to impede the establishment and growth of bone metastasis. Parallel-flow chamber assay, homotypic aggregation assay, modified Boyden chamber assay, and clonogenic growth assay were used to assess the effects of Lac-l-Leu on tumor cell adhesion to the endothelium, homotypic tumor cell aggregation, transendothelial migration, and clonogenic survival and growth, respectively. We report that daily intraperitoneal administration of Lac-l-Leu resulted in a three-fold (P < .05) decrease in metastatic tumor burden compared with the untreated control. Mechanistically, the effect of Lac-l-Leu, which binds and inhibits galectins by mimicking essential structural features of the TF-Ag, was associated with a dose-dependent inhibition of prostate cancer cell adhesion to bone marrow endothelium, homotypic aggregation, transendothelial migration, and clonogenic growth. We conclude that small-molecular-weight carbohydrate-based compounds targeting \u03b2-galactoside-mediated interactions could provide valuable means for controlling and preventing metastatic prostate cancer spread to the skeleton.",

     "abstract": "Early studies suggested androgen receptor (AR) splice variants might contribute to the progression of prostate cancer (PCa) into castration resistance. However, the therapeutic strategy to target these AR splice variants still remains unresolved. Through tissue survey of tumors from the same patients before and after castration resistance, we found that the expression of AR3, a major AR splice variant that lacks the AR ligand-binding domain, was substantially increased after castration resistance development. The currently used antiandrogen, Casodex, showed little growth suppression in CWR22Rv1 cells. Importantly, we found that AR degradation enhancer ASC-J9 could degrade both full-length (fAR) and AR3 in CWR22Rv1 cells as well as in C4-2 and C81 cells with addition of AR3. The consequences of such degradation of both fAR and AR3 might then result in the inhibition of AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in vitro. More importantly, suppression of AR3 specifically by short-hairpin AR3 or degradation of AR3 by ASC-J9 resulted in suppression of AR transcriptional activity and cell growth in CWR22Rv1-fARKD (fAR knockdown) cells in which DHT failed to induce, suggesting the importance of targeting AR3. Finally, we demonstrated the in vivo therapeutic effects of ASC-J9 by showing the inhibition of PCa growth using the xenografted model of CWR22Rv1 cells orthotopically implanted into castrated nude mice with undetectable serum testosterone. These results suggested that targeting both fAR- and AR3-mediated PCa growth by ASC-J9 may represent the novel therapeutic approach to suppress castration-resistant PCa. Successful clinical trials targeting both fAR and AR3 may help us to battle castration-resistant PCa in the future.",

Using a disease model comprising primary human schwannoma cells, we previously demonstrated that adherens junctions (AJs) are impaired in schwannoma cells because of a ubiquitous, upregulated Rac activity. However, the mechanism by which loss of contact inhibition leads to proliferation remains obscure in merlin-deficient tumors. In this study, we show that proliferative Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is elevated as active \u03b2-catenin (dephosphorylated at serine 37 and threoine 41) localizes to the nucleus and the Wnt targets genes c-myc and cyclin D1 are upregulated in confluent human schwannoma cells. We demonstrate that Rac effector p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) is essential for the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling because depletion of PAK2 suppressed active \u03b2-catenin, c-myc, and cyclin D1. Most importantly, the link between the loss of the AJ complex and the increased proliferation in human schwannoma cells is connected by Src and platelet-derived growth factor receptor\u2013induced tyrosine 654 phosphorylation on \u03b2-catenin and associated with degradation of N-cadherin. We also demonstrate that active merlin maintains \u03b2-catenin and N-cadherin complex at the plasma membrane through direct regulation. Finally, we demonstrate that phosphorylation of tyrosine 654 is critical for the increased proliferation in human schwannoma cells because overexpression of a Y654F mutant \u03b2-catenin reduces hyperproliferation of schwannoma cells. We suggest a model that these pathways are coordinated and relevant for proliferation in merlin-deficient tumors.",

However, the impact of EGFRvIII on survival of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) has not been definitively established. In the present study, we prospectively evaluated 73 patients with primary GBM treated with surgical resection and standard radio/chemotherapy. The EGFRvIII was assessed by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (PCR), O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation was assessed by methylation-specific PCR, and phosphatase and tension homolog (PTEN) expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. In 14 patients of this series, who presented with tumor recurrence, EGFRvIII was determined by real-time PCR. Sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) was assessed in vitro on GBM neurosphere cell cultures with different patterns of EGFRvIII expression. Age 60 years or younger, preoperative Karnofsky Performance Status score of 70 or higher, recursive partitioning analysis score III and IV, methylated MGMT, and Ki67 index of 20% or less were significantly associated with longer overall survival (OS; P = .0069, P =.0035, P = .0007, P = .0437, and P = .0286, respectively). EGFRvIII identified patients with significantly longer OS (P = .0023) and the association of EGFRvIII/Ki67 of 20% or less, EGFRvIII/normal PTEN, EGFRvIII/methylated MGMT, and EGFRvIII/normal PTEN/methylated MGMT identified subgroups of GBM patients with better prognosis. In recurred GBMs, EGFRvIII expression was approximately two-fold lower than in primary tumors. In vitro, the EGFRvIII-negative GBM neurosphere cells were more resistant to TMZ than the positive ones. In conclusion, in contrast with previous studies, we found that EGFRvIII is associated with prolonged survival of GBM patients treated with surgery and radio/chemotherapy. Depletion of EGFRvIII in recurrent GBMs as well as differential sensitivity to TMZ in vitro indicates that the EGFRvIII-negative cell fraction is involved in resistance to radio/chemotherapy and tumor repopulation.",

To improve on this, we applied the COXEN informatics approach to in vitro radiation sensitivity data of transcriptionally profiled human cells and gene expression data from untreated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and bladder tumors to generate a multigene predictive model that is independent of histologic findings and reports on tumor radiosensitivity. The predictive ability of this 41-gene model was evaluated in patients with HNSCC and was found to stratify clinical outcome after radiotherapy. In contrast, this model was not useful in stratifying similar patients not treated with radiation. This led us to hypothesize that expression of some of the 41 genes contributes to tumor radioresistance and clinical recurrence. Hence, we evaluated the expression the 41 genes as a function of in vitro radioresistance in the NCI-60 cancer cell line panel and found cyclophilin B (PPIB), a peptidylprolyl isomerase and target of cyclosporine A (CsA), had the strongest direct correlation. Functional inhibition of PPIB by small interfering RNA depletion or CsA treatment leads to radiosensitization in cancer cells and reduced cellular DNA repair. Immunohistochemical evaluation of PPIB expression in patients with HNSCC was found to be associated with outcome after radiotherapy. This work demonstrates that a novel 41-gene expression model of radiation sensitivity developed in bladder cancer cell lines and human skin fibroblasts predicts clinical outcome after radiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients and identifies PPIB as a potential target for clinical radiosensitization.",

Cell sensitivity to PLX4032 was dependent on BRAFV600E and independent from other gene alterations that commonly occur in melanoma such as PTEN loss, BRAF, and MITF gene amplification. Two cell lines lacking sensitivity to PLX4032 and harboring a different set of genetic alterations were studied as models of primary resistance. Treatment with the MEK inhibitor UO126 but not with PLX4032 inhibited cell growth and ERK activation. Resistance to PLX4032 was maintained after CRAF down-regulation by siRNA indicating alternative activation of MEK-ERK signaling. Genetic characterization by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification and analysis of phosphotyrosine signaling by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis revealed the activation of MET and SRC signaling, associated with the amplification of MET and of CTNNB1 and CCND1 genes, respectively. The combination of PLX4032 with drugs or siRNA targeting MET was effective in inhibiting cell growth and reducing cell invasion and migration in melanoma cells with MET amplification; similar effects were observed after targeting SRC in the other cell line, indicating a role for MET and SRC signaling in primary resistance to PLX4032.

Although multiple reports identified a role for TNF signaling in established cancers, few studies have assessed the impact of TNF blockade on early tumor formation promotion. We aimed at exploring the effects of TNF neutralization in a preclinical mouse model of lung carcinogenesis. For this, Balb/c mice (n = 42) received four weekly intraperitoneal urethane injections (1 g/kg) and twice-weekly intraperitoneal soluble TNF receptor (etanercept; 10 mg/kg) administered during tumor initiation/promotion, tumor progression, or continuously (months 1, 6, and 1-8 after urethane start, respectively). Lung oncogenesis was assessed after 8 months. In separate short-term studies, Balb/c mice (n = 21) received a single control or urethane injection followed by twice-weekly intraperitoneal control or sTNFR:Fc injections. Lung inflammation was assessed after 1 week. We found that sTNFR:Fc treatment during tumor initiation/promotion resulted in a significant reduction of tumor number but not dimensions. However, sTNFR:Fc administered during tumor progression did not impact tumor multiplicity but significantly decreased tumor diameter. Continued sTNFR:Fc administration was effective in halting both respiratory tumor formation and progression in response to urethane. This favorable impact was associated with impaired cellular proliferation and new vessel formation in lung tumors. In addition, TNF neutralization altered the lung inflammatory response to urethane, evidenced by reductions in TNF and macrophage and increases in interferon \u03b3 and interleukin 10 content of the air spaces. sTNFR:Fc treatment of RAW264.7 macrophages downregulated TNF and enhanced interferon \u03b3 and interleukin 10 expression. In conclusion, TNF neutralization is effective against urethane-induced lung oncogenesis in mice and could present a lung chemoprevention strategy worth testing clinically.",

     "abstract": "Patients with metastatic ovarian cancer continue to have a dismal prognosis, emphasizing the need for new strategies to identify and develop new molecular targets for therapy. Chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 are upregulated in metastatic ovarian cancer cells and the intraperitoneal tumor microenvironment. CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling promotes multiple steps in proliferation and dissemination of ovarian cancer cells, suggesting that targeted inhibition of this pathway will limit tumor progression. To investigate CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling in ovarian cancer and establish effects of inhibiting this pathway on tumor progression and survival, we designed a Gaussia luciferase complementation imaging reporter system to detect CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 in ovarian cancer cells. In cell-based assays, we established that the complementation imaging reporter could detect CXCL12 binding to CXCR4 and quantify specific inhibition of ligand-receptor interaction. We monitored CXCL12-CXCR4 binding and inhibition in a mouse xenograft model of metastatic human ovarian cancer by imaging Gaussia luciferase complementation and assessed tumor progression with firefly luciferase. Bioluminescence imaging studies in living mice showed that treatment with AMD3100, a clinically approved inhibitor of CXCL12-CXCR4, blocked ligand-receptor binding and reduced growth of ovarian cancer cells. Treatment with AMD3100 also modestly improved overall survival of mice with metastatic ovarian cancer. The Gaussia luciferase complementation imaging reporter system will facilitate further preclinical development and optimization of CXCL12-CXCR4 targeted compounds for treatment of ovarian cancer. Our research supports clinical translation of existing CXCR4 inhibitors for molecular therapy for ovarian cancer.",

Here, we provide the first evidence that nuclear factor (NF) \u03baB is required for Smac mimetic\u2013 mediated sensitization of pancreatic carcinoma cells for gemcitabine-induced apoptosis. The Smac mimetic BV6 cooperates with gemcitabine to reduce cell viability and to induce apoptosis. In addition, BV6 significantly enhances the cytotoxicity of several anticancer drugs against pancreatic carcinoma cells, including doxorubicin, cisplatin, and 5-fluorouracil. Molecular studies reveal that BV6 stimulates NF-\u03baB activation, which is further increased in the presence of gemcitabine. Importantly, inhibition of NF-\u03baB by overexpression of the dominant-negative I\u03baB\u03b1 superrepressor significantly decreases BV6- and gemcitabine-induced apoptosis, demonstrating that NF-\u03baB exerts a proapoptotic function in this model of apoptosis. In support of this notion, inhibition of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) by the TNF\u03b1 blocking antibody Enbrel reduces BV6- and gemcitabine-induced activation of caspase 8 and 3, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and apoptosis. By demonstrating that BV6 and gemcitabine trigger a NF-\u03baB\u2013dependent, TNF\u03b1-mediated loop to activate apoptosis signaling pathways and caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death, our findings have important implications for the development of Smac mimetic\u2013based combination protocols in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.",

     "abstract": "Autophagy plays diverse roles in Ras-related tumorigenesis. H-rasval12 induces autophagy through multiple signaling pathways including Raf-1/ERK pathway, and various ERK downstream molecules of autophagy have been reported. In this study, Bcl-2/adenovirus E1B 19-kDa\u2013interacting protein 3 (BNIP3) is identified as a downstream transducer of the Ras/Raf/ERK signaling pathway to induce autophagy. BNIP3 was upregulated by H-rasval12 at the transcriptional level to compete with Beclin 1 for binding with Bcl-2. H-rasval12\u2013induced autophagy suppresses cell proliferation demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo by expression of ectopic BNIP3, Atg5, or interference RNA of BNIP3 (siBNIP3) and Atg5 (shAtg5) using mouse NIH3T3 and embryo fibroblast cells. H-rasval12 induces different autophagic responses depending on the duration of Ras overexpression. After a short time (48 hours) of Ras overexpression, autophagy inhibits cell proliferation. In contrast, a longer time (2 weeks) of Ras overexpression, cell proliferation was enhanced by autophagy. Furthermore, overexpression of mutant Ras, BNIP3, and LC3-II was detected in bladder cancer T24 cells and the tumor parts of 75% of bladder cancer specimens indicating a positive correlation between autophagy and tumorigenesis. Taken together, our mouse model demonstrates a balance between BNIP3-mediated autophagy and H-rasval12\u2013induced tumor formation and reveals that H-rasval12 induces autophagy in a BNIP3-dependent manner, and the threshold of autophagy plays a decisive role in H-rasval12\u2013induced tumorigenesis. Our findings combined with others\u2019 reports suggest a new therapeutic strategy against Ras-related tumorigenesis by negative or positive regulation of autophagic activity, which is determined by the level of autophagy and tumor progression stages.",

Targeting expression to alveolar type II cells or to Clara cells, the two likely precursors of human NSCLC, revealed differential tumorigenicity between these cells. Whereas expression of oncogenic C-RAF in alveolar type II cells readily induced multifocal macroscopic lung tumors independent of the developmental state, few tumors with type II pneumocytes features and incomplete penetrance were found when targeted to Clara cells. Induced tumors did not progress and were strictly dependent on the initiating oncogene. Deinduction of mice resulted in tumor regression due to autophagy rather than apoptosis.

Here, we demonstrate that whole-exome sequencing data can also be analyzed for comprehensively monitoring somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) by benchmarking the technique against conventional array CGH. A series of 17 matched tumor and normal tissues from patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer was used for this assessment. We show that targeted exome sequencing reliably identifies CNAs that are common in advanced prostate cancer, such as androgen receptor (AR) gain and PTEN loss.

However, EGFR expression was not predictive for response, and markers to characterize an erlotinib-responding PDAC group are currently missing. In this work, we observed high erlotinib IC50 values in a panel of human and murine PDAC cell lines. Using EGFR small interfering RNA, we detected that the erlotinib response was marginally influenced by EGFR. To find novel EGFR targets, we used an unbiased chemical proteomics approach for target identification and quality-controlled target affinity determination combined with quantitative mass spectrometry based on stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture. In contrast to gefitinib, we observed a broad target profile of erlotinib in PDAC cells by quantitative proteomics. Six protein kinases bind to erlotinib with similar or higher affinity (Kd = 0.09-0.358 \u03bcM) than the EGFR (Kd 0.434 \u03bcM). We provide evidence that one of the novel erlotinib targets, ARG, contributes in part to the erlotinib response in a PDAC cell line. Our data show that erlotinib is a multikinase inhibitor, which can act independent of EGFR in PDAC. These findings may help to monitor future erlotinib trials in the clinic.",

Bone marrow samples from 51 patients with high-risk MDS (13 with refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia, 19 with refractory anemia with excess blast 1, and 19 with refractory anemia with excess blast 2) were analyzed for C-CBL mutations at both diagnosis and sAML in the same individuals. Mutational analysis was performed for exons 7 to 9 of C-CBL gene. Of the 51 paired samples, C-CBL mutations were identified in 6 patients at the sAML phase. One patient retained the identical C-CBL mutation (G415S) at sAML evolution and exhibited clonal expansion. The other five patients acquired C-CBL mutations (Y371S, F418S, L370_Y371 ins L, L399V, and C416W) during sAML evolution. Three of the six patients harboring C-CBL mutations at sAML had additional gene mutations including JAK2V617F, PTPN11, or N-RAS. There was no significant difference in clinicohematological features and overall survival with respect to C-CBL mutation status. Our results show that C-CBL mutation is very rare (0.6%) in MDS, but acquisition and/or expansion of C-CBL mutant clones occur in 11.8% of patients during sAML transformation. The findings suggest that C-CBL mutations play a role at least in part in a subset of MDS patients during sAML transformation.",

     "abstract": "We report that daurinol, a novel arylnaphthalene lignan, is a promising potential anticancer agent with adverse effects that are less severe than those of etoposide, a clinical anticancer agent. Despite its potent antitumor activity, clinical use of etoposide is limited because of its adverse effects, including myelosuppression and the development of secondary leukemia. Here, we comprehensively compared the mechanistic differences between daurinol and etoposide because they have similar chemical structures. Etoposide, a topoisomerase II poison, is known to attenuate cancer cell proliferation through the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Etoposide treatment induces G2/M arrest, severe DNA damage, and the formation of giant nuclei in HCT116 cells. We hypothesized that the induction of DNA damage and nuclear enlargement due to abnormal chromosomal conditions could give rise to genomic instability in both tumor cells and in actively dividing normal cells, resulting in the toxic adverse effects of etoposide. We found that daurinol is a catalytic inhibitor of human topoisomerase II\u03b1, and it induces S-phase arrest through the enhanced expression of cyclins E and A and by activation of the ATM/Chk/Cdc25A pathway in HCT116 cells. However, daurinol treatment did not cause DNA damage or nuclear enlargement in vitro. Finally, we confirmed the in vivo antitumor effects and adverse effects of daurinol and etoposide in nude mice xenograft models. Daurinol displayed potent antitumor effects without any significant loss of body weight or changes in hematological parameters, whereas etoposide treatment led to decreased body weight and white blood cell, red blood cell, and hemoglobin concentration.",

However, its ability to inhibit Jak2-V617F\u2013mediated myeloproliferative neoplasia, with particular emphasis in the bone marrow, has not previously been examined. Here, we investigated the efficacy of G6 in a transgenic mouse model of Jak2-V617F\u2013mediated myeloproliferative neoplasia. We found that G6 provided therapeutic benefit to the peripheral blood as determined by elimination of leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and erythrocytosis. G6 normalized the pathologically high plasma concentrations of interleukin 6 (IL-6). In the liver, G6 eliminated Jak2-V617F\u2013driven extramedullary hematopoiesis. With respect to the spleen, G6 significantly reduced both the spleno-megaly and megakaryocytic hyperplasia. In the critically important bone marrow, G6 normalized the pathologically high levels of phospho-Jak2 and phospho\u2013signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5). It significantly reduced the megakaryocytic hyperplasia in the marrow and completely normalized the M/E ratio. Most importantly, G6 selectively reduced the mutant Jak2 burden by 67% on average, with virtual elimination of mutant Jak2 cells in one third of all treated mice. Lastly, clonogenic assays using marrow stem cells from the myeloproliferative neoplasm mice revealed a time-dependent elimination of the clonogenic growth potential of these cells by G6. Collectively, these data indicate that G6 exhibits exceptional efficacy in the peripheral blood, liver, spleen, and, most importantly, in the bone marrow, thereby raising the possibility that this compound may alter the natural history of Jak2-V617F\u2013mediated myeloproliferative neoplasia.",

     "abstract": "Clinical resistance to chemotherapy is a frequent event in cancer treatment and is closely linked to poor outcome. High-grade serous (HGS) ovarian cancer is characterized by p53 mutation and high levels of genomic instability. Treatment includes platinum-based chemotherapy and initial response rates are high; however, resistance is frequently acquired, at which point treatment options are largely palliative. Recent data indicate that platinumresistant clones exist within the sensitive primary tumor at presentation, implying resistant cell selection after treatment with platinum chemotherapy. The AKT pathway is central to cell survival and has been implicated in platinum resistance. Here, we show that platinum exposure induces an AKT-dependent, prosurvival, DNA damage response in clinically platinum-resistant but not platinum-sensitive cells. AKT relocates to the nucleus of resistant cells where it is phosphorylated specifically on S473 by DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and this activation inhibits cisplatin-mediated apoptosis. Inhibition of DNA-PK or AKT, but not mTORC2, restores platinum sensitivity in a panel of clinically resistant HGS ovarian cancer cell lines: we also demonstrate these effects in other tumor types. Re-sensitization is associated with prevention of AKT-mediated BAD phosphorylation. Strikingly, in patient-matched sensitive cells, we do not see enhanced apoptosis on combining cisplatin with AKT or DNA-PK inhibition. Insulin-mediated activation of AKT is unaffected by DNA-PK inhibitor treatment, suggesting that this effect is restricted to DNA damage\u2013mediated activation of AKT and that, clinically, DNA-PK inhibition might prevent platinum-induced AKT activation without interfering with normal glucose homeostasis, an unwanted toxicity of direct AKT inhibitors.",

Human endogenous retrovirus (HERV)-K with 5\u2032LTR-gag-pro-pol-env-rec/np9-3\u2032LTR sequences represents the newest retrovirus family that integrated into the human genome 1 to 5 million years ago. Although a high-level expression of HERV-K in melanomas, breast cancers, and terato-carcinomas has been demonstrated, the mechanism of the lineage-specific activation of the long terminal repeat (LTR) remains obscure. We studied chromosomal HERV-K expression in MeWo melanoma cells in comparison with the basal expression in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. Cloned LTR of HERV-K (HML-2.HOM) was also characterized by mutation and transactivation experiments. We detected multiple transcriptional initiator (Inr) sites in the LTR by rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends (5\u2032 RACE). HEK293 and MeWo showed different Inr usage. The most potent Inr was associated with a TATA box and three binding motifs of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF). Both chromosomal HERV-K expression and the cloned LTR function were strongly activated in HEK293 by transfection with MITF-M, a melanocyte/melanoma\u2013specific isoform of MITF. Coexpression of MITF and the HERV-K core antigen was detected in retinal pigmented epithelium by an immunofluorescence analysis. Although malignant melanoma lines MeWo, G361, and SK-MEL-28 showed enhanced HERV-K transcription compared with normal melanocytes, the level of MITF-M messenger RNA persisted from normal to transformed melanocytes. Thus, MITF-M may be a prerequisite for the pigmented cell lineage\u2013specific function of HERV-K LTR, leading to the high-level expression in malignant melanomas.",

We previously showed in a model of pancreatic \u03b2-cell tumorigenesis that acute Myc activation in vivo triggers rapid recruitment of mast cells to the tumor site and that this is absolutely required for angiogenesis and macroscopic tumor expansion. More-over, systemic inhibition of mast cell degranulation with sodium cromoglycate induced death of tumor and endothelial cells in established tumors. Hence, mast cells are required both to establish and to maintain the tumors. Whereas this intimates that selective inhibition of mast cell function could be therapeutically efficacious, cromoglycate is not a practical drug for systemic delivery in humans, and no other systemic inhibitor of mast cell degranulation has hitherto been available. PCI-32765 is a novel inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) that blocks mast cell degranulation and is currently in clinical trial as a therapy for B-cell non\u2013Hodgkin lymphoma. Here, we show that systemic treatment of insulinoma-bearing mice with PCI-32765 efficiently inhibits Btk, blocks mast cell degranulation, and triggers collapse of tumor vasculature and tumor regression.

Transcriptional levels of this gene are significantly elevated in various types of cancer including bladder and lung cancers. Immunohistochemical analysis using a number of clinical tissues confirmed significant up-regulation of WHSC1 expression in bladder and lung cancer cells at the protein level. Treatment of cancer cell lines with small interfering RNA targeting WHSC1 significantly knocked down its expression and resulted in the suppression of proliferation. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that knockdown of WHSC1 decreased the cell population of cancer cells at the S phase while increasing that at the G2/M phase. WHSC1 interacts with some proteins related to the WNT pathway including \u03b2-catenin and transcriptionally regulates CCND1, the target gene of the \u03b2-catenin/Tcf-4 complex, through histone H3 at lysine 36 trimethylation. This is a novel mechanism for WNT pathway dysregulation in human carcinogenesis, mediated by the epigenetic regulation of histone H3.

To more closely mirror in vivo conditions, transformation of FTECs was driven by the positive selection of growth-promoting alterations rather antibiotic selection. Injection of the transformed FTEC lines in SCID mice resulted in xenografts with histologic and immunohistochemical features indistinguishable from poorly differentiated serous carcinomas. Transcriptional profiling revealed high similarity among the transformed and control FTEC lines and patient-derived serous ovarian carcinoma cells and was used to define a malignancy-related transcriptional signature. Oncogene-treated FTEC lines were serially analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis to identify oncogenes whose expression was subject to positive selection. The combination of p53 and Rb inactivation (mediated by SV40 T antigen), hTERT expression, and oncogenic C-MYC and HRAS accumulation showed positive selection during transformation. Knockdown of each of these selected components resulted in significant growth inhibition of the transformed cell lines that correlated with p27 accumulation. The combination of SV40 T antigen and hTERT expression resulted in immortalized cells that were nontumorigenic in mice, whereas forced expression of a dominant-negative p53 isoform (p53DD) and hTERT resulted in senescence.

     "abstract": "Lung carcinogenesis in humans involves an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to alterations in normal lung epithelium, to in situ carcinoma, and finally to invasive and metastatic cancers. The loss of transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-induced tumor suppressor function in tumors plays a pivotal role in this process, and our previous studies have shown that resistance to TGF-\u03b2 in lung cancers occurs mostly through the loss of TGF-\u03b2 type II receptor expression (T\u03b2RII). However, little is known about the mechanism of down-regulation of T\u03b2RII and how histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDIs) can restore TGF-\u03b2-induced tumor suppressor function. Here we show that HDIs restore T\u03b2RII expression and that DNA hypermethylation has no effect on T\u03b2RII promoter activity in lung cancer cell lines. TGF-\u03b2-induced tumor suppressor function is restored by HDIs in lung cancer cell lines that lack T\u03b2RII expression. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway by either activated Ras or epidermal growth factor signaling is involved in the down-regulation of T\u03b2RII through histone deacetylation. We have immunoprecipitated the protein complexes by biotinylated oligonucleotides corresponding to the HDI-responsive element in the T\u03b2RII promoter (\u2212127/(\u221275) and identified the proteins/factors using proteomics studies. The transcriptional repressor Meis1/2 is involved in repressing the T\u03b2RII promoter activity, possibly through its recruitment by Sp1 and NF-YA to the promoter. These results suggest a mechanism for the downregulation of T\u03b2RII in lung cancer and that TGF-\u03b2 tumor suppressor functions may be restored by HDIs in lung cancer patients with the loss of T\u03b2RII expression.",

     "abstract": "Ligand-dependent activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway has been implicated in both tumor initiation and metastasis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Prior studies in genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) have assessed the role of Hh signaling by cell autonomous expression of a constitutively active Gli2 within epithelial cells. On the contrary, aberrant pathway reactivation in the human exocrine pancreas occurs principally as a consequence of Sonic Hh ligand (Shh) overexpression from epithelial cells. To recapitulate the cognate pathophysiology of Hh signaling observed in the human pancreas, we examined GEMM where Hh ligand is conditionally overexpressed within the mature exocrine pancreas using a tamoxifen-inducible Elastase-Cre promoter (Ela-CreERT2;LSL-mShh). We also facilitated potential cell autonomous epithelial responsiveness to secreted Hh ligand by generating compound transgenic mice with concomitant expression of the Hh receptor Smoothened (Ela-CreERT2;LSL-mShh;LSL-mSmo). Of interest, none of these mice developed intraductal precursor lesions or PDAC during the follow-up period of up to 12 months after tamoxifen induction. Instead, all animals demonstrated marked expansion of stromal cells, consistent with the previously described epithelial-to-stromal paracrine Hh signaling. Hh responsiveness was mirrored by the expression of primary cilia within the expanded mesenchymal compartment and the absence within mature acinar cells. In the absence of cooperating mutations, Hh ligand overexpression in the mature exocrine pancreas is insufficient to induce neoplasia, even when epithelial cells coexpress the Smo receptor. This autochthonous model serves as a platform for studying epithelial stromal interactions in pancreatic carcinogenesis.",

We performed functional assays to test the influence of each CM on colorectal cell lines. Microarray and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) were performed in DLD1 cells cultured in matched CM. In DLD1 cells, CAF-LM CM compared with CAF-PT CM and NCF led to a more aggressive phenotype, induced the features of an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition more efficiently, and stimulated migration and invasion to a greater extent. Sustained stimulation with CAF-LM CM evoked a transient G2/M cell cycle arrest accompanied by a reduction of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation, and decreased viability of SW1116, SW620, SW480, DLD1, HT-29, and Caco-2 cells and provoked nonapoptotic cell death in those cells carrying KRAS mutations. Cells resistant to CAF-LM CM completely changed their morphology in an extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase-dependent process and depicted an increased stemness capacity alongside the Wnt pathway stimulation. The transcriptomic profile of DLD1 cells treated with CAF-LM CM was associated with Wnt and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways activation in GSEA. Therefore, the liver microenvironment induces more efficiently the aggressiveness of colorectal cancer cells than other matched microenvironments do but secondarily evokes cell death. Resistant cells displayed higher stemness capacity.",

Tumor-specific T-cell precursors were detected in Ad-TK+Ad-Flt3L-treated WT mice but not in Igh6-/- mice. The treatment also failed in WT mice depleted of total B cells or marginal zone B cells. Because we could not detect circulating antibodies against tumor cells and the treatment was equally efficient in WT mice and in mice with B-cell-specific deletion of Prdm 1 (encoding Blimp-1), in which B cells are present but unable to fully differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells, tumor regression in this model is not dependent on B cells\u2019 production of tumor antigen-specific immunoglobulins. Instead, B cells seem to play a role as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Treatment with Ad-TK+Ad-Flt3L led to an increase in the number of B cells in the cervical lymph nodes, which stimulated the proliferation of syngeneic T cells and induced clonal expansion of antitumor T cells. Our data show that B cells act as APCs, playing a critical role in clonal expansion of tumor antigen-specific T cells and brain tumor regression.",

Inhibition of REV3 expression in cancer cells leads to an accumulation of persistent DNA damage as indicated by an increase in phospho-ATM, 53BP1, and phospho-H2AX foci formation, subsequently leading to the activation of the ATM-dependent DNA damage response cascade. REV3 depletion in p53-proficient cancer cell lines results in a G1 arrest and induction of senescence as indicated by the accumulation of p21 and an increase in senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity. In contrast, inhibition of REV3 expression in p53-deficient cells results in growth inhibition and a G2/M arrest. A small fraction of the p53-deficient cancer cells can overcome the G2/M arrest, which results in mitotic slippage and aneuploidy. Our findings reveal that REV3 depletion per se suppresses growth of cancer cell lines from different origin, whereas control cell lines and a mesothelial primary culture were less affected. Thus, our findings indicate that depletion of REV3 not only can amend cisplatin-based cancer therapy but also can be applied for susceptible cancers as a potential monotherapy.",

Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Smac mimetic primes apoptosis-resistant, FADD- or caspase-8-deficient leukemia cells for TNF\u03b1-induced necroptosis in a synergistic manner. In contrast to TNF\u03b1, Smac mimetic significantly enhances CD95-induced apoptosis in wild-type but not in FADD-deficient cells. Interestingly, Smac mimetic- and TNF\u03b1-mediated cell death occurs without characteristic features of apoptosis (i.e., caspase activation, DNA fragmentation) in FADD-deficient cells. By comparison, Smac mimetic and TNF\u03b1 trigger activation of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and DNA fragmentation in wild-type cells. Consistently, the caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk fails to block Smac mimetic- and TNF\u03b1-triggered cell death in FADD- or caspase-8-deficient cells, while it confers protection in wild-type cells. By comparison, necrostatin-1, an RIP1 kinase inhibitor, abolishes Smac mimetic- and TNF\u03b1-induced cell death in FADD- or caspase-8-deficient. Thus, Smac mimetic enhances TNF\u03b1-induced cell death in leukemia cells via two distinct pathways in a context-dependent manner: it primes apoptosis-resistant cells lacking FADD or caspase-8 to TNF\u03b1-induced, RIP1-dependent and caspase-independent necroptosis, whereas it sensitizes apoptosis-proficient cells to TNF\u03b1-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis. These findings have important implications for the therapeutic exploitation of necroptosis as an alternative cell death program to overcome apoptosis resistance.",

     "publication date": "10-2011",
     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) have been proposed to predict patient response to antiangiogenic cancer therapy. However, contradictory reports and inconsistency in the phenotypic identification of CECs have led us to compare three cell populations with partially overlapping phenotype in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy and the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab. METHODS: Patients (n = 20) with locally advanced pancreatic cancer were monitored during 16 weeks of neoadjuvant treatment with gemcitabine and bevacizumab. Detection of circulating cell populations was based on the marker combination CD45, CD31, and CD146; levels of viable and dead (7-aminoactinomycin D-positive) cells were evaluated by flow cytometry in 2-week intervals. RESULTS: We were able to discriminate and concomitantly monitor three cell populations elevated in cancer patients. Whereas CECs were defined as CD45- CD31+ CD146+, the distinct populations of CD45- CD31- CD146+ and CD45- CD31high CD146- cells were partly positive for CD3 and CD41, respectively. CECs and CD45- CD31- CD146+ cells increased during therapy; the rise in dead cells was positively correlated with patient response or survival. Conversely, CD45- CD31high CD146- cells decreased in neoadjuvant treatment. A highly significant correlation was established for improved patient response and a minor decrease in viable cell counts. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometric CEC analysis based on CD45, CD31, and CD146 requires careful discrimination between blood cell populations with overlapping phenotype showing hallmarks of activated T cells and large platelets. However, these three cell populations show distinct regulation during cancer therapy, and their concomitant analysis may offer extended prognostic and predictive information.",

Although the cancer stem cell (CSC) model provides a trail to characterize the cells responsible for tumor onset, the NB tumor-initiating cell (TIC) has not been identified. In this study, the relevance of the CSC model in NB was investigated by taking advantage of typical functional stem cell characteristics. A predictive association was established between self-renewal, as assessed by serial sphere formation, and clinical aggressiveness in primary tumors. Moreover, cell subsets gradually selected during serial sphere culture harbored increased in vivo tumorigenicity, only highlighted in an orthotopic microenvironment. A microarray time course analysis of serial spheres passages from metastatic cells allowed us to specifically \u201cprofile\u201d the NB stem cell-like phenotype and to identify CD133, ABC transporter, and WNT and NOTCH genes as spheres markers. On the basis of combined sphere markers expression, at least two distinct tumorigenic cell subpopulations were identified, also shown to preexist in primary NB. However, sphere markers-mediated cell sorting of parental tumor failed to recapitulate the TIC phenotype in the orthotopic model, highlighting the complexity of the CSC model. Our data support the NB stem-like cells as a dynamic and heterogeneous cell population strongly dependent on microenvironmental signals and add novel candidate genes as potential therapeutic targets in the control of high-risk NB.",

Resolving these issues will help translation of therapies from research to clinic by helping clinicians develop patient-specific treatments based on the unique signatures of patient's tumor.

While several rich data repositories for high-dimensional research data exist in the public domain, most focus on a single-data type and do not support integration across multiple technologies. Currently, G-DOC contains data from more than 2500 breast cancer patients and 800 gastrointestinal cancer patients, G-DOC includes a broad collection of bioinformatics and systems biology tools for analysis and visualization of four major \u201comics\u201d types: DNA, mRNA, microRNA, and metabolites.

To effectively target each of these characteristics, it is important to understand their sequence during tumorigenesis. However, because most gliomas are diagnosed at an advanced stage, the chronology of gliomagenesis milestones is not well understood. The aim of the present study was to determine the onset of these characteristics during tumor development. Brain tumor-initiating cells (BTICs) were established by overexpressing H-RasV12 in normal neural stem/progenitor cells isolated from the subventricular zone of adult mice harboring a homozygous deletion of the Ink4a/Arf locus. High-grade malignant brain tumors were then created by orthotopic implantation of 105 BTICs into the forebrain of 6-week-old wild-type mice. Micewere killed every week for 5 weeks, and tumors were assessed for cellular atypia, proliferation, hemorrhage, necrosis, and invasion. All mice developed highly invasive, hypervascular glioblastoma-like tumors. A 100% penetrance rate and a 4-week median survival were achieved. Tumor cell migration along fiber tracts started within days after implantation and was followed by perivascular infiltration of tumor cells with marked recruitment of reactive host cells. Next, cellular atypia became prominent. Finally, mass proliferation and necrosis were observed in the last stage of the disease. Video monitoring of BTICs in live brain slices confirmed the early onset of migration, as well as the main cell migration patterns. Our results showed that perivascular and intraparenchymal tumor cell migration precede tumor mass formation in the adult brain, suggesting the need for an early and sustained anti-invasion therapy.",

     "abstract": "The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is rising in the United States. An important risk factor for EAC is the presence of Barrett esophagus (BE). BE is the replacement of normal squamous esophageal epithelium with a specialized columnar epithelium in response to chronic acid and bile reflux. However, the emergence of BE from squamous keratinocytes has not yet been demonstrated. Our research has focused on this. Wnt and cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2) are two pathways whose activation has been associated with BE and progression to EAC, but their role has not been tested experimentally. To explore their contribution, we engineered a human esophageal keratinocyte cell line to express either a dominant-active Wnt effector CatCLef or a Cox2 complementary DNA. In a two-dimensional culture environment, Cox2 expression increases cell proliferation and migration, but neither transgene induces known BE markers. In contrast, when these cells were placed into three-dimensional organotypic culture conditions, we observed more profound effects. CatCLef-expressing cells were more proliferative, developed a thicker epithelium, and upregulated Notch signaling and several BE markers including NHE2. Cox2 expression also increased cell proliferation and induced a thicker epithelium. More importantly, we observed cysts form within the epithelium, filled with intestinal mucins including Muc5B and Muc17. This suggests that Cox2 expression in a three-dimensional culture environment induces a lineage of mucin-secreting cells and supports an important causal role for Cox2 in BE pathogenesis. We conclude that in vitro modeling of BE pathogenesis can be improved by enhancing Wnt signaling and Cox2 activity and using three-dimensional organotypic culture conditions.",

However, the precise contributions of the uPA/plasmin system to specific steps involved in cancer cell dissemination have not been fully established. Herein, we have used a highly disseminating variant of the human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell line, PC-hi/diss, as a prototype of aggressive carcinomas to investigate the mechanisms whereby pro-uPA activation and uPA-generated plasmin functionally contribute to specific stages of metastasis. The PC-hi/diss cells secrete and activate significant amounts of pro-uPA, leading to efficient generation of plasmin in solution and at the cell surface. In a mouse orthotopic xenograft model, treatment with the specific pro-uPA activation-blocking antibody mAb-112 significantly inhibited local invasion and distant metastasis of the PC-hi/diss cells. To mechanistically examine the uPA/plasmin-mediated aspects of tumor cell dissemination, the anti-pro-uPA mAb-112 and the potent serine protease inhibitor, aprotinin, were used in parallel in a number of in vivo assays modeling various rate-limiting steps in early metastatic spread. Our findings demonstrate that, by generating plasmin, activated tumor-derived uPA facilitates early stages of PC-hi/diss dissemination, specifically the escape from the primary tumor and tumor cell intravasation. Moreover, through a series of in vitro and in vivo analyses, we suggest that PC-hi/diss-invasive escape and dissemination may be enhanced by cleavage of stromal fibronectin by uPA-generated plasmin. Together, our findings point to inhibition of pro-uPA activation at the apex of the uPA/plasmin cascade as a therapy-valid approach to control onset of tumor escape and ensuing metastatic spread.",

Its tissue distribution was claimed to be wider in normal than in neoplastic tissues, and surface HLA-E was undetectable in most tumor cell lines. Herein, these issues were reinvestigated taking advantage of HLA-E-specific antibodies, immunohistochemistry, and biochemical methods detecting intracellular and surface HLA-E regardless of conformation. Contrary to published evidence, HLA-E was detected in a few normal epithelia and in a large fraction (approximately 1/3) of solid tumors, including those derived from HLA-E-negative/low-normal counterparts. Remarkably, HLA-E was detected in 30 of 30 tumor cell lines representative of major lymphoid and nonlymphoid lineages, and in 11 of 11, it was surface-expressed, although in a conformation poorly reactive with commonly used antibodies. Coexpression of HLA-E and HLA class I ligand donors was not required for surface expression but was associated with NKG2A-mediated protection from lysis by the cytotoxic cell line NKL and polyclonal NK cells from healthy donors, as demonstrated by antibody-mediated relief of protection in 10% to 20% of the tested target-effector combinations. NKG2A-mediated protection of additional targets became evident on NK effector blocking with antibodies to activating receptors (DNAM-1, natural cytotoxicity receptors, and NKG2D). Thus, initial evidence that the long-elusive HLA-E molecule is enhanced by malignant transformation and is functional in tumor cells is presented here, although its importance and precise functional role remain to be addressed in the context of a general understanding of the NK ligand-receptor network.",

     "abstract": "A hallmark of malignant gliomas is their ability to disperse through neural tissue, leading to long-term failure of all known therapies. Identifying new antimigratory targets could reduce glioma recurrence and improve therapeutic efficacy, but screens based on conventional migration assays are hampered by the limited ability of these assays to reproduce native cell motility. Here, we have analyzed the motility, gene expression, and sensitivity to migration inhibitors of glioma cells cultured on scaffolds formed by submicron-sized fibers (nanofibers) mimicking the neural topography. Glioma cells cultured on aligned nanofiber scaffolds reproduced the elongated morphology of cells migrating in white matter tissue and were highly sensitive to myosin II inhibition but only moderately affected by stress fiber disruption. In contrast, the same cells displayed a flat morphology and opposite sensitivity to myosin II and actin inhibition when cultured on conventional tissue culture polystyrene. Gene expression analysis indicated a correlation between migration on aligned nanofibers and increased STAT3 signaling, a known driver of glioma progression. Accordingly, cell migration out of glioblastoma-derived neurospheres and tumor explants was reduced by STAT3 inhibitors at subtoxic concentrations. Remarkably, these inhibitors were ineffective when tested at the same concentrations in a conventional two-dimensional migration assay. We conclude that migration of glioma cells is regulated by topographical cues that affect cell adhesion and gene expression. Cell migration analysis using nanofiber scaffolds could be used to reproduce native mechanisms of migration and to identify antimigratory strategies not disclosed by other in vitro models.",

This correlation was validated by treatment with the 5-aza-DAC demethylation agent. The level of hypomethylation was 63.0% in 73 clinical HCC tissue samples and was associated with increased (2.1-fold) hsa-miR-191 expression. The elevated expression of hsa-miR-191 in the SMMC-771 HCC cell line induced the cells to transition into mesenchymal-like cells; they exhibited characteristics such as loss of adhesion, down-regulation of epithelial cell markers, up-regulation of mesenchymal cell markers, and increased cell migration and invasion. Inhibiting hsa-miR-191 expression in the SMMC-7721 cell line reversed this process (as assessed by cell morphology and cell markers). Furthermore, hsa-miR-191 probably exerted its function by directly targeting TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 3 and inhibiting TIMP3 protein expression. Our results suggest that hsa-miR-191 locus hypomethylation causes an increase in hsa-miR-191 expression in HCC clinical tissues and that this expression induces HCC cells to transition into mesenchymal-like cells.",

     "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests that FOXO1 possesses a tumor suppressor function. Inactivation of FOXO1 has been documented in many types of human cancer, and restoring the activity of FOXO1 holds promise for cancer treatment. In this study, we identified a FOXO1-derived peptide termed FO1-6nls that inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases 1 and 2 (CDK1/2)-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 at the serine 249 residue in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of FO1-6nls in prostate cancer (PCa) cells not only blocked CDK1-induced cytoplasmic localization of FOXO1 but also augmented FOXO1's transcriptional activity. This effect of FO1-6nls requires its binding to CDK1 and CDK2. Moreover, the ectopic expression of FO1-6nls inhibited the growth of PTEN-positive DU145 PCa cells. Importantly, the growth-inhibitory function of FO1-6nls is dependent on FOXO1. Finally, the ectopic expression of FO1-6nls overcame CDK1-mediated inhibition of FOXO1-induced apoptosis of PCa cells. These results indicate that the FOXO1-derived peptide FO1-6nls can restore FOXO1's tumor suppressor function by specifically opposing CDK1/2-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of FOXO1 and hence may have a therapeutic potential for the treatment of PCa.",

     "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cancer (ESC) is one of the most aggressive tumors of the gastrointestinal tract. A combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy (CRT) has improved the clinical outcome, but the molecular background determining the effectiveness of therapy remains unknown. NRF2 is a master transcriptional regulator of stress adaptation, and gain of-function mutation of NRF2 in cancer confers resistance to stressors including anticancer therapy. Direct resequencing analysis revealed that Nrf2 gain-of-function mutation occurred recurrently (18/82, 22%) in advanced ESC tumors and ESC cell lines (3/10). The presence of Nrf2 mutation was associated with tumor recurrence and poor prognosis. Short hairpin RNA-mediated down-regulation of NRF2 in ESC cells that harbor only mutated Nrf2 allele revealed that themutant NRF2 conferred increased cell proliferation, attachment-independent survival, and resistance to 5-fluorouracil and \u03b3-irradiation. Based on the Nrf2 mutation status, gene expression signatures associated with NRF2 mutation were extracted from ESC cell lines, and their potential utility for monitoring and prognosis was examined in a cohort of 33 pre-CRT cases of ESC. The molecular signatures of NRF2 mutation were significantly predictive and prognostic for CRT response. In conclusion, recurrent NRF2 mutation confers malignant potential and resistance to therapy in advanced ESC, resulting in a poorer outcome. Molecular signatures of NRF2 mutation can be applied as predictive markers of response to CRT, and efficient inhibition of aberrant NRF2 activation could be a promising approach in combination with CRT.",

Nearly two thirds of newly diagnosed CRC cases include lymph node (LN) involvement, and LN metastasis is one of the strongest negative prognostic factors for CRC. It is thought that CRC tumors contain a small population of drug-resistant CRC tumor-initiating cells (Co-TICs) that may be responsible for cancer recurrence. To evaluate the effects of the LN stromal cells on Co-TICs, we established a unique xenoplant model using CRC cells isolated by enzymatic digestion from consented patient specimens, HT-29 cells, HCA-7 cells, and LN stromal cell line HK cells. We found that HK cells and HK cell-conditioned media enhanced CRC tumor formation and tumor angiogenesis. Cells expressing CD133+ and the stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1) receptor CXCR4 were enriched in chemotherapeutic-resistant CRC cells. CD133+CXCR4+ Co-TICs isolated from patient specimens are more tumorigenic than unsorted tumor cells. Furthermore, the inhibitors specific to HK cell-derived SDF-1\u03b1 reduced tumor formation and tumor angiogenesis. Our results have demonstrated a role for Co-TICs in tumor growth and defined the influence of LN stromal cells on Co-TICs. We have identified a major Co-TIC/LN microenvironment-specific mechanism for CRC resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and established experimental platforms for both in vitro and in vivo testing, indicating that SDF-1\u03b1 and its receptor, CXCR4, may be targets for clinical therapy.",

The aim of this study was to delineate the cross talk between PDAC and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with a focus on the mechanism creating the chronic inflammatory tumor milieu. We assessed the effects of the cross talk between PDAC and CAF cell lines on the creation and sustenance of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment in pancreatic cancer. The coculture of PDAC and CAF cell lines enhanced the levels of inflammatory factors including IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, CXCL8, VEGF-A, CCL20, and COX-2. CAFs were superior to tumor cells regarding the production of most inflammatory factors, and tumor cell-associated IL-1\u03b1 was established as the initiator of the enhanced production of inflammatory factors through the binding of IL-1\u03b1 to IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) expressed predominantly by CAFs. Furthermore, we found a correlation between IL-1\u03b1 and CXCL8 expression levels in PDAC tissues and correlation between IL-1\u03b1 expression and the clinical outcome of the patients. This confirmed an important role for the IL-1 signaling cascade in the creation and sustenance of a tumor favorable microenvironment. Neutralization of the IL-1\u03b1 signaling efficiently diminished the cross talk-induced production of inflammatory factors. These data suggest that the cross talk between PDAC cells and the main stroma cell type, i.e. CAFs, is one essential factor in the formation of the inflammatory tumor environment, and we propose that neutralization of the IL-1\u03b1 signaling might be a potential therapy for this cancer.",

Although the role of EHMT2 in transcriptional regulation has been well documented, the pathologic consequences of its dysfunction in human disease have not been well understood. Here, we describe important roles of EHMT2 in human carcinogenesis. Expression levels of EHMT2 are significantly elevated in human bladder carcinomas compared with nonneoplastic bladder tissues (P < .0001) in real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Complementary DNA microarray analysis also revealed its overexpression in various types of cancer. The reduction of EHMT2 expression by small interfering RNAs resulted in the suppression of the growth of cancer cells and possibly caused apoptotic cell death in cancer cells. Importantly, we show that EHMT2 can suppress transcription of the SIAH1 gene by binding to its promoter region (-293 to +51) and by methylating lysine 9 of histone H3. Furthermore, an EHMT2-specific inhibitor, BIX-01294, significantly suppressed the growth of cancer cells. Our results suggest that dysregulation of EHMT2 plays an important role in the growth regulation of cancer cells, and further functional studies may affirm the importance of EHMT2 as a promising therapeutic target for various types of cancer.",

Elevation of the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a large family of zinc endopeptidases, in adenomas serves as a biomarker of early tumorigenesis. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of using a newly developed near-infrared bioactivatable probe (MMPSense 680) that reports the activity of a broad array of MMP isoforms to detect early colorectal adenomas. Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc)+/Min-FCCC mice that spontaneously develop multiple colorectal adenomas were injected with MMPSense 680, and the colons were imaged in an IVIS Spectrum system ex vivo. Image analyses were correlated with histopathologic findings for all regions of interest (ROIs). The biochemical basis of fluorescent signal was investigated by immunohistochemical staining of MMP-7 and -9. A strong correlation (Kendall = 0.80) was observed between a positive signal and the presence of pathologically confirmed colonic adenomas; 92.9% of the 350 ROIs evaluated were classified correctly. The correlation between two independent observers was 0.87. MMP-7 expression was localized to epithelial cells of adenomas and microadenomas, whereas staining of MMP-9 was found in infiltrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes within the adenomas. MMPSense 680 identifies colorectal adenomas, both polypoid and nonpolypoid, in Apc+/Min-FCCC mice with high specificity. Use of this fluorescent probe in combination with colonoscopy could aid in preventing colorectal neoplasias by providing new opportunities for early detection and therapeutic intervention.",

A constitutively active version of I\u03baB kinase 2 (IKK2), which is activated by many inflammatory stimuli, was expressed specifically in the prostate epithelium. Constitutive activation of the IKK2/nuclear factor \u03baB axis was insufficient for prostate transformation. However, in combination with heterozygous loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog, IKK2 activation led to an increase in tumor size, formation of cribriform structures, and increase in fiber in the fibroblastic stroma. This phenotype was coupled with persistent inflammation evoked by chemokine expression in the epithelium and stroma. The hyperplastic and dysplastic epithelia correlated with changes evoked by decreased androgen receptor activation. Conversely, inflammation correlated with stromal changes highlighted by loss of smooth muscle cells around prostate ducts. Despite the loss of the smooth muscle barrier, tumors were rarely invasive in a C57BL/6 background. Data mining revealed that smooth muscle markers are also downregulated in human prostate cancers, and loss of these markers in primary tumors is associated with subsequent metastasis. In conclusion, our data show that loss of smooth muscle and invasiveness of the tumor are not coupled in our model, with inflammation leading to increased tumor size and a dedifferentiated stroma.",

In this study, we identified frequent intragenic loss of heterozygosity and six novel driver mutations within ALK in lung adenocarcinomas. Overexpression of H694R or E1384K mutant ALK leads to hyperphosphorylation of ALK, and activation of its downstream mediators STAT3, AKT, and ERK resulted in enhanced cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, and tumor growth in xenograft models. Furthermore, the activated phospho-Y1604 ALK was increasingly detected in 13 human lung cancer cell lines and 263 lung cancer specimens regardless of tumor stages and types. Treatment of two different ALK inhibitors, WHI-P154 and NVP-TAE684, resulted in the down-regulation of aberrant ALK signaling, shrinkage of tumor, and suppression of metastasis and significantly improved survival of ALK mutant-bearing mice. Together, we identified that novel ALK point mutations possessed tumorigenic effects mainly through hyperphosphorylation of Y1604 and activation of downstream oncogenic signaling. The upregulated phospho-Y1604 ALK could serve as a diagnostic biomarker for lung cancer. Furthermore, targeting oncogenic mutant ALKs with inhibitors could be a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of fatal lung cancers.",

However, the clinical translation of MSCs remains poorly defined because previous studies relied on glioma models with uncertain relevance to human disease, typically xenograft models in immunocompromised mice. To address this shortcoming, we used the RCAS/Ntv-a system, in which endogenous gliomas that recapitulate the tumor and stromal features of human gliomas develop in immunocompetent mice. MSCs were harvested from bonemarrowof Ntv-a mice and injected into the carotid artery of Ntv-a mice previously inoculated with RCAS-PDGF-B and RCAS-IGFBP2 to induce malignant gliomas (n = 9). MSCs were labeled with luciferase for in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI). After intra-arterial injection, BLI revealed MSCs in the right frontal lobe in seven of nine mice. At necropsy, gliomas were detected within the right frontal lobe in all these mice, correlating with the location of the MSCs. In the twomice without MSCs based on BLI, no tumor was found, indicating thatMSC localization was tumor specific. In another cohort of mice (n = 9), MSCs were labeled with SP-DiI, a fluorescent vital dye. After intra-arterial injection, fluorescence microscopy revealed SP-DiI-labeled MSCs throughout tumors 1 to 7 days after injection but not in nontumoral areas of the brain. MSCs injected intravenously did not localize to tumors (n = 12). We conclude that syngeneic MSCs are capable of homing to endogenous gliomas in immunocompetent mice. These findings support the use of MSCs as tumor-specific delivery vehicles for treating gliomas.",

However, recent studies have shown that Ku70 is also found in the cytoplasm and binds Bax, preventing Bax-induced cell death. We have shown that, in neuroblastoma cells, the binding between Ku70 and Bax depends on the acetylation status of Ku70, such that, when Ku70 is acetylated, Bax is released from Ku70, triggering cell death. Thus, to survive, in neuroblastoma cells, cytoplasmic Ku70 acetylation status is carefully regulated such that Ku70 is maintained in a deacetylated state, keeping Bax complexed with Ku70. We have shown that overexpression of CREB-binding protein (CBP), a known acetyltransferase that acetylates Ku70, releases Bax from Ku70, triggering apoptosis. Although we have shown that blocking deacetylase activity using non-type-specific inhibitors also triggers Ku70 acetylation and Bax-dependent cell death, the targets of these deacetylase inhibitors in neuroblastoma cells remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that, in neuroblastoma cells, histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) binds Ku70 and Bax in the cytoplasm and that knocking down HDAC6 or using an HDAC6-specific inhibitor triggers Bax-dependent cell death.

To evaluate the efficacy of targeting GPC3 at the translational level, we used RNA interference to examine the biologic and molecular effects of GPC3 suppression in HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Transfection of Huh7 and HepG2 cells with GPC3-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited cell proliferation (P < .001) together with cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase, down-regulation of antiapoptotic protein (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1), and replicative senescence. Gene expression analysis revealed that GPC3 suppression significantly correlated with transforming growth factor beta receptor (TGFBR) pathway (P = 4.57e-5) and upregulated TGF-\u03b22 at both RNA and protein levels. The effects of GPC3 suppression by siRNA can be recapitulated by addition of human recombinant TGF-\u03b22 to HCC cells in culture, suggesting the possible involvement of TGF-\u03b22 in growth inhibition of HCC cells. Cotransfection of siRNA-GPC3 with siRNA-TGF-\u03b22 partially attenuated the effects of GPC3 suppression on cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and replicative senescence, confirming the involvement of TGF-\u03b22 in siRNA-GPC3-mediated growth suppression. In vivo, GPC3 suppression significantly inhibited the growth of orthotopic xenografts of Huh7 and HepG2 cells (P < .05), accompanied by increased TGF-\u03b22 expression, reduced cell proliferation (observed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining), and enhanced apoptosis (by TUNEL staining).

     "abstract": "The prognosis of patients with many types of cancers correlates with the degree of metastasis to regional lymph nodes (LNs) and vital organs. However, the mechanisms and route of cancer cell metastasis are still unclear. Previous studies determined that B-cell accumulation in tumor-draining LNs (TDLNs) induces lymphatic sinus growth (lymphangiogenesis) and increases lymph flow, which could actively promote tumor dissemination through the lymphatic system. Using young E\u00b5-c-Myc mice that feature LN B-cell expansion as hosts for tumor transplants, we show that subcutaneously implanted lymphomas or melanomas preferentially spread to TDLNs over non-TDLNs, thus demonstrating that these tumors initially metastasize through lymphatic rather than through hematogenous routes. In addition, the rate and amount of tumor dissemination is greater in E\u00b5-c-Myc mice versus wild-type hosts, which correlates with LN B-cell accumulation and lymphangiogenesis in E\u00b5-c-Myc hosts. The increased lymphatic dissemination in E\u00b5-c-Myc hosts is further associated with rapid hematogenous tumor spread of subcutaneously implanted lymphomas, suggesting that TDLN metastasis secondarily drives lymphoma spread to distant organs. In contrast, after intravenous tumor cell injection, spleen metastasis of lymphoma cells or lung metastasis of melanoma cells is similar in E\u00b5-c-Myc and wild-type hosts. These studies demonstrate that the effect of E\u00b5-c-Myc hosts to promote metastasis is limited to the lymphatic route of dissemination. TDLN B-cell accumulation, in association with lymphangiogenesis and increased lymph flow, thus significantly contributes to dissemination of lymphomas and solid tumors, providing new targets for therapeutic intervention to block metastasis.",

Increasing T\u03b2RIII expression in colon cancer model systems enhanced ligand-mediated phosphorylation of p38 and the Smad proteins, while switching TGF-\u03b2 and BMP-2 from inhibitors to stimulators of colon cancer cell proliferation, inhibiting ligand-induced p21 and p27 expression.

Conversely, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of SMURF2 destabilized EGFR, induced an autophagic response and reduced the clonogenic survival of EGFR-expressing cancer cell lines, with minimal effects on EGFR-negative cancer cells, normal fibroblasts, and normal epithelial cells. UMSCC74B head and neck squamous cancer cells, which form aggressive tumors in nudemice, significantly lost in vivo tumor-forming ability on siRNA-mediated SMURF2 knockdown.

Forced expression of the enzyme in mice prostates is associated with matrix degradation, invasive growth, and prostate cancer progression. Conversely, hepsin overexpression in metastatic prostate cancer cell lines was reported to induce cell cycle arrest and reduction of invasive growth in vitro. We used a system for doxycycline (dox)-inducible target gene expression in metastasis-derived PC3 cells to analyze the effects of hepsin in a quantitative manner. Loss of viability and adhesion correlated with hepsin expression levels during anchorage-dependent but not anchorage-independent growth. Full expression of hepsin led to cell death and detachment and was specifically associated with reduced phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473, which was restored by growth on matrix derived from RWPE1 normal prostatic epithelial cells. In the chorioallantoic membrane xenograft model, hepsin overexpression in PC3 cells reduced the viability of tumors but did not suppress invasive growth.

However, all of these findings do not sufficiently explain the oncogenic potential of miR-122. In the current study, we used two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis to measure changes in the expression of thousands of proteins in response to the inhibition of miR-122 in human hepatoma cells. Several proteins that were upregulated on miR-122 inhibition were involved in the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway. The overexpression of miR-122 resulted in the repression of UPR pathway activation. Therefore, miR-122 may act as an inhibitor of the chaperone gene expression and negatively regulate the UPR pathway in HCC. We further showed that the miR-122 inhibitor enhanced the stability of the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit 10 (PSMD10) through the up-regulation of its target gene cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). This process may activate the UPR pathway to prevent chemotherapy-mediated tumor cell apoptosis. The current study suggests that miR-122 negatively regulates the UPR through the CDK4-PSMD10 pathway. The down-regulation of miR-122 activated the CDK4-PSMD10-UPR pathway to decrease tumor cell anticancer drug-mediated apoptosis. We identified a new HCC therapeutic target and proclaimed the potential risk of the therapeutic use of miR-122 silencing.",

However, its precise role in breast cancer and metastasis remains unclear. Here, we show that transient adenoviral expression of KLF4 in the 4T1 orthotopic mammary cancer model significantly attenuated primary tumor growth as well as micrometastases to the lungs and liver. These results can be attributed, in part, to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Further supporting a tumor-suppressive role for KLF4 in the breast, we found that KLF4 expression is lost in a mouse model of HER2/NEU/ERBB2-positive breast cancer. To determine whether enforced KLF4 expression could alter tumor latency in these mice, we used a doxycycline-inducible expression model in the context of the MMTV-Neu transgene. Surprisingly, tumors that developed in this model also lost KLF4 expression, suggesting negative selection for sustained expression. We have previously reported that KLF4 inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a preliminary step in metastatic progression. Overexpression of KLF4 in 4T1 cells led to a significant reduction in the expression of Snail, a key mediator of EMT and metastasis. Conversely, KLF4 silencing increased Snail expression in the nontransformed MCF-10A cell line. Collectively, these data demonstrate the first functional, in vivo evidence for KLF4 as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cells. Furthermore, our findings suggest an inhibitory role for KLF4 during breast cancer metastases that functions, in part, through repression of Snail.",

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 is often inactivated in breast cancer cells because the overexpression of its repressors (e.g., MDM2 and MDMX). Restoration of p53 activity by small molecules through counteracting p53 repressors can lead to in vivo tumor regression and is therefore considered a promising strategy for treatments of cancer. Recent efforts in high-throughput drug screening and rational drug design have identified several structurally diverse small-molecule p53 activators, including a pseudourea derivative XI-011 (NSC146109). This small molecule strongly activates p53 while selectively inhibiting growth of transformed cells without inducing genotoxicity, indicating its potential as a drug lead for p53-targeted therapy. However, the mechanism(s) by which XI-011 activates p53 and the effects of XI-011 on growth of breast cancer cells are currently unknown. Here, we report that XI-011 promoted breast cancer cells to undergo apoptosis through activating p53 and inducing expression of proapoptotic genes. Importantly, we found that activation of p53 by this small molecule was achieved through a novel mechanism, that is, inhibition of MDMX expression. XI-011 repressed the MDMX promoter, resulting in down-regulation of MDMX messenger RNA level in MCF-7 cells. In line with these results, XI-011 decreased the viability of breast cancer cells expressing low levels of MDMX in a less-efficient manner. Interestingly, XI-011 acted additively with the MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a to inhibit growth of breast cancer cells. We conclude that XI-011 belongs to a novel class of small-molecule p53 activators that target MDMX and could be of value in treating breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are the most malignant among brain tumors. They are frequently refractory to chemotherapy and radiotherapy with mean patient survival of approximately 6 months, despite surgical intervention. The highly glycolytic nature of glioblastomas describes their propensity to metabolize glucose to lactic acid at an elevated rate. To survive, GBMs efflux lactic acid to the tumor microenvironment through transmembrane transporters denoted monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). We hypothesized that inhibition of MCT function would impair the glycolytic metabolism and affect both glioma invasiveness and survival. We examined the effect on invasiveness with \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (ACCA, 4CIN, CHCA), a small-molecule inhibitor of lactate transport, through Matrigel-based and organotypic (brain) slice culture invasive assays using U87-MG and U251-MG glioma cells. We then conducted studies in immunodeficient rats by stereotaxic intracranial implantation of the glioma cells followed by programmed orthotopic application of ACCA through osmotic pumps. Effect on the implanted tumor was monitored by small-animal magnetic resonance imaging. Our assays indicated that glioma invasion was markedly impaired when lactate efflux was inhibited. Convection-enhanced delivery of inhibitor to the tumor bed caused tumor necrosis, with 50% of the animals surviving beyond the experimental end points (3 months after inhibitor exhaustion). Most importantly, control animals did not display any adverse neurologic effects during orthotopic administration of ACCA to brain through programmed delivery. These results indicate the clinical potential of targeting lactate efflux in glioma through delivery of small-molecule inhibitors of MCTs either to the tumor bed or to the postsurgical resection cavity.",

Such adaptability can be visualized in vitro, when cells are cultured in conditions that recapitulate three-dimensional microenvironments. Using thick collagen layers in cell culture and in vivo extravasation assays, we found that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) suppressed lung extravasation of aggressive melanoma by coordinated regulation of cell shape and proteolysis. In cells grown on a thick collagen bed, PEDF overexpression and exogenous PEDF blocked the rapidly invasive, rounded morphology, and promoted an elongated, mesenchymal-like phenotype associated with reduced invasion. These changes in cell shape depended on decreased RhoA and increased Rac1 activation and were mediated by the up-regulation of Rac1-GEF, DOCK3 and down-regulation of Rac1-GAP, ARHGAP22. Surprisingly, we found that PEDF overexpression also blocked the trafficking of membrane-tethered, MT1-MMP to the cell surface through RhoA inhibition and Rac1 activation. In vivo, knockdown of Rac1 and DOCK3 or overexpression of MT1-MMP was sufficient to reverse the inhibitory effect of PEDF on extravasation. Using functional studies, we demonstrated that PEDF suppressed the rounded morphology and MT1-MMP surface localization through its antiangiongenic, 34-mer epitope and the recently identified PEDF receptor candidate, PNPLA2. Our findings unveil the coordinated regulation of cell shape and proteolysis and identify an unknown mechanism for PEDF's antimetastatic activity.",

Carboxyterminal phosphorylation affects merlin activity, but many open questions on the regulation of merlin function still remain. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway is activated in human vestibular schwannoma, suggesting a role for Akt-dependent merlin regulation in the formation of these tumors. In this study, we identify merlin serine 10 as a novel substrate for Akt phosphorylation. We demonstrate that this N-terminal phosphorylation directs merlin for proteasome-mediated degradation and affects merlin binding to the E3 ligase component DCAF1. Our data indicate that sequential phosphorylation of merlin C- and N-terminus by different oncogenic kinases targets merlin for degradation and thus downregulates its activity.

     "abstract": "The tumor suppressor p53 provides an important barrier to the initiation and maintenance of cancers. As a consequence, p53 function must be inactivated for a tumor to develop. This is achieved by mutation in approximately 50% of cases and probably by functional inactivation in the remaining cases. We have previously shown that the second messenger cAMP can inhibit DNA damage-induced wild-type p53 accumulation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, leading to a profound reduction of their apoptotic response. In the present article, we provide a mechanistic insight into the regulation of p53 levels by cAMP. We show that increased levels of cAMP augment the binding of p53 to its negative regulator HDM2, overriding the DNA damage-induced dissociation of p53 from HDM2. This results in maintained levels of p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, which in turn counteracts the DNA damage-induced stabilization of the p53 protein. The apoptosis inhibitory effect of cAMP is further shown to depend on this effect on p53 levels. These findings potentially implicate deregulation of cAMP signaling as a candidate mechanism used by transformed cells to quench the p53 response while retaining wild-type p53.",

We have characterized sphere-cultured glioma-derived cancer-initiating cells (GICs) from experimental gliomas induced by platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) in neonatal Gtv-a Arf-/- mice. We found that the GICs can maintain their stem cell-like characteristics in absence of exogenous epidermal growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 and that this culture condition was highly selective for tumor-initiating cells where as few as five GICs could induce secondary tumor formation after orthotopic transplantation. Addition of FBS to the medium caused the GICs to differentiate into cells coexpressing glial fibrillary acidic protein and Tuj1, and this differentiation process was reversible, suggesting that the GICs are highly plastic and able to adapt to different environments without losing their tumorigenic properties. On inhibition of virally transduced PDGF-B by small interfering RNA treatment, the GICs stopped proliferating, lost their self-renewal ability, and started to uniformly express CNPase, a marker of oligodendrocyte precursor cells and mature oligodendrocytes. Most importantly, PDGF-B depletion completely abrogated the tumor-initiating capacity of the GICs.

The prevailing view is that targeting the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signal transduction pathway will not be beneficial for triple-negative breast cancers because their growth is not IGF-responsive. The present study investigates the importance of IGFs in the proliferation and survival of triple-negative breast cancer cells. Estrogen and progesterone receptors, HER2, type I IGF, and insulin receptors were measured by Western transfer analysis. The effects of IGF-1 on proliferation were assessed by DNA quantitation and on cell survival by poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. The effect of IGF-1 on phosphorylation of the IGF receptors, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase, was measured by Western transfer analysis. Seven cell lines were identified as models of triple-negative breast cancer and shown to express IGF receptors at levels similar to those present in estrogen-responsive cell lines known to respond to IGFs. IGF-1 increased the proliferation and cell survival of all triple-negative cell lines. Proliferation was attenuated after reduction of type I IGF receptor expression. Cells that express higher levels of receptor were more sensitive to subnanomolar IGF-1 concentrations, but the magnitude of the effects was not correlated simply with the absolute amount or phosphorylation of the IGF receptors, Akt or mitogen-activated protein kinase. These results show that IGFs stimulate cell proliferation and promote cell survival in triple-negative breast cancer cells and warrant investigation of the IGF signal transduction pathway as a therapeutic target for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.",

Transformed epithelial cells can switch to a motile, mesenchymal phenotype by epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Recently, it has been shown that EMT is functionally linked to prostate cancer stem cells, which are not only critically involved in prostate cancer maintenance but also in bone metastasis. We showed that treatment with the non-peptide \u03b1v-integrin antagonist GLPG0187 dose-dependently increased the E-cadherin/vimentin ratio, rendering the cells a more epithelial, sessile phenotype. In addition, GLPG0187 dose-dependently diminished the size of the aldehyde dehydrogenase high subpopulation of prostate cancer cells, suggesting that \u03b1v-integrin plays an important role in maintaining the prostate cancer stem/progenitor pool. Our data show that GLPG0187 is a potent inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption and angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Real-time bioluminescent imaging in preclinical models of prostate cancer demonstrated that blocking \u03b1v-integrins by GLPG0187 markedly reduced their metastatic tumor growth according to preventive and curative protocols. Bone tumor burden was significantly lower in the preventive protocol. In addition, the number of bone metastases/mouse was significantly inhibited. In the curative protocol, the progression of bone metastases and the formation of new bone metastases during the treatment period was significantly inhibited. In conclusion, we demonstrate that targeting of integrins by GLPG0187 can inhibit the de novo formation and progression of bone metastases in prostate cancer by antitumor (including inhibition of EMT and the size of the prostate cancer stem cell population), antiresorptive, and antiangiogenic mechanisms.",

Interestingly, ADT also induced high levels of vimentin expression in prostate cancer cell lines in vitro and in human prostate tumors in vivo. The induction of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype by androgen depletion was mediated, at least in part, by down-regulation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, whereas the neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer cells was under separate control. These data demonstrate a previously unrecognized link between inhibition of androgen receptor signaling, down-regulation of S-phase kinase-associated protein 2, and the appearance of secretory, tumor-promoting senescent cells in prostate tumors.

Human GBM U87 (methylated MGMT promoter), T98 (unmethylated MGMT promoter), and endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with combinations of LY2109761, TMZ, and radiation.

We found that telomeres at some specific chromosome arms remain well maintained or even lengthened in a high frequency (27/32) of leukemia cases.

Our results strongly indicate the presence of a special leukemia cell population, or a clone, originated from a common progenitor that is characterized with chromosome arm-specific long telomeres.

We report here that apoptosis is not the sole mechanism by which MLN4924 suppresses tumor cell growth because apoptosis is moderately induced by the drug in some cancer cell lines and drug-induced growth suppression is only partially blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor, z-VAD. MLN4924 treatment induces the characteristics of senescence phenotypes as evidenced by enlarged and flattened cellular morphology and positive staining of senescence-associated \u03b2-Gal. MLN4924-induced senescence is associated with cellular response to DNA damage, triggered by accumulation of DNA-licensing proteins CDT1 and ORC1, as a result of inactivation of CRL/SCF E3s. The senescence occurs in the manner independent of pRB/p16 and p53, but dependent on p21, a known substrate of CRL/SCF E3s and a mediator of senescence, which accumulates on CRL/SCF inactivation by MLN4924. Furthermore, MLN4924-induced senescence is irreversible and coupled with persistent accumulation of p21 and sustained activation of DNA damage response. Our study reveals a novel mechanism of MLN4924 action and showed that MLN4924 could be further developed as an effective anticancer agent by inducing apoptosis and irreversible senescence.",

It is becoming clearer within the cancer literature base that tumor stroma plays a bimodal role in cancer development: it impedes neoplastic growth in normal tissue while encouraging migration and tumor growth in a co-opted desmoplastic response during tumor progression. In this review, we discuss this reciprocal influence that ovarian cancer epithelial cells may have on ovarian stromal cell-reactive phenotype, stromal cell behavior, disrupted signaling networks, and tumor suppressor status in the stroma, within the context of cancer fibroblast studies from alternate cancer tissue settings. We focus on the exchange of secreted factors, in particular interleukin 1\u03b2 and SDF-1\u03b1, between activated fibroblasts and cancer cells as a key area for future investigation and therapeutic development. A better understanding of the bidirectional reliance of early epithelial cancer cells on activated stromal cells could lead to the identification of novel diagnostic stromal markers and targets for therapy.",

     "abstract": "Transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) regulates all stages of mammary gland development, including the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and the suppression of tumorigenesis in mammary epithelial cells (MECs). Interestingly, mammary tumorigenesis converts TGF-\u03b2 from a tumor suppressor to a tumor promoter through molecular mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Changes in integrin signaling and tissue compliance promote the acquisition of malignant phenotypes in MECs in part through the activity of lysyl oxidase (LOX), which regulates desmoplastic reactions and metastasis. TGF-\u03b2 also regulates the activities of tumor reactive stroma and MEC metastasis. We show here that TGF-\u03b21 stimulated the synthesis and secretion of LOX from normal and malignant MECs in vitro and in mammary tumors produced in mice. The ability of TGF-\u03b21 to activate Smad2/3 was unaffected by LOX inactivation in normal MECs, whereas the stimulation of p38 MAPK by TGF-\u03b21 was blunted by inhibiting LOX activity in malignant MECs or by inducing the degradation of hydrogen peroxide in both cell types. Inactivating LOX activity impaired TGF-\u03b21-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition and invasion in breast cancer cells. We further show that increasing extracellular matrix rigidity by the addition of type I collagen to three-dimensional organotypic cultures promoted the proliferation of malignant MECs, a cellular reaction that was abrogated by inhibiting the activities of TGF-\u03b21 or LOX, and by degrading hydrogen peroxide. Our findings identify LOX as a potential mediator that couples mechanotransduction to oncogenic signaling by TGF-\u03b21 and suggest that measures capable of inactivating LOX function may prove effective in diminishing breast cancer progression stimulated by TGF-\u03b21.",

     "publication date": "05-2011",
     "abstract": "Purpose: Chemotherapeutic agents that have shown improved patient outcome when combined with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy were recently identified to induce the mobilization of proangiogenic Tie-2-expressing monocytes (TEMs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) by platelet release of stromal cell-derived factor 1\u03b1 (SDF-1\u03b1). VEGF blockade was found to counteract cell mobilization. We aimed to determine why agents like gemcitabine do not elicit TEM and EPC recruitment and may therefore lack synergy with anti-VEGF therapy. Experimental Design: Locally advanced pancreatic cancer patients (n = 20) were monitored during 16 weeks of neoadjuvant therapy. Treatment was based on gemcitabine with or without the addition of bevacizumab. Blood levels of proangiogenic cell populations and angiogenesis factors were determined in 2-week intervals. Results: The lack of EPC mobilization during gemcitabine therapy was associated with severe thrombocytopenia and reduced SDF-1\u03b1 blood concentrations. Furthermore, myelosuppression by gemcitabine correlated significantly with loss of TEMs. With respect to angiogenic factors stored and released by platelets, plasma levels of the angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) were selectively decreased and correlated significantly with thrombocytopenia in response to gemcitabine therapy. Conclusions: A thorough literature screen identified thrombocytopenia as a common feature of chemotherapeutic agents that lack synergy with anti-VEGF treatment. Our results on gemcitabine therapy indicate that myelosuppression (in particular, with respect to thrombocytes and monocytes) interferes with the mobilization of proangiogenic cell types targeted by bevacizumab and may further counteract antiangiogenic therapy by substantially reducing the angiogenesis inhibitor TSP-1.",

CaR activation has been shown to increase proliferation in several cancer cell lines; however, its presence or function has never been documented in lung cancer. We report that Ca2+o-activated CaR results in MAPK-mediated stimulation of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) production in human lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) in vivo. Furthermore, a single nucleotide polymorphism in CaR identified from a hypercalcemia-inducing lung SCC reduced the receptor's activation threshold leading to increased PTHrP expression and secretion. Increasing the expression of either wild-type CaR or a CaR variant with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the cytoplasmic domain was both necessary and sufficient for lung SCC to induce HHM. Because lung cancer patients who frequently develop HHM and PTHrP expression in lung cancer has been only partially explained, the significance of our findings indicates that CaR variants may provide a positive feedback between PTHrP and calcium and result in the syndrome of HHM.",

In most human breast cancer tissues, another G1-regulatory CDK, CDK2, is also hyperactivated by various mechanisms and is believed to be an important therapeutic target. In this report, we provide genetic evidence that CDK2 is essential for proliferation and oncogenesis of murine mammary epithelial cells. We observed that 87% of Cdk2-null mice were protected from ErbB-2-induced mammary tumorigenesis. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from Cdk2-null mouse showed resistance to various oncogene-induced transformation. Previously, we have reported that hemizygous loss of Cdc25A, the major activator of CDK2, can also protect mice from ErbB-2-induced mammary tumorigenesis [Cancer Res (2007) 67(14): 6605\u201311].

Selectins are vascular cell adhesion molecules that mediate tumor cell interactions with platelets, leukocytes, and the vascular endothelium. Heparanase is an endoglycosidase that degrades heparan sulfate in the tumor microenvironment, cell surfaces, and vessel wall. Acting together, these molecules facilitate tumor cell arrest, extravasation, and metastasis. Here, we report the preparation of novel semisynthetic sulfated tri mannose C-C-linked dimers (STMCs) endowed with heparanase and selectin inhibitory activity. The P-selectin specificity of the STMC was defined by the anomeric linkage of the C-C bond. This STMC hexasaccharide is an effective inhibitor of P-selectin in vivo. We show that selective inhibition of heparanase attenuates metastasis in B16-BL6 melanoma cells, expressing high levels of this endoglycosidase, but has no effect on the metastasis of MC-38 carcinoma cells that express little or no heparanase activity. P-selectin-specific STMC attenuated metastasis in both animal models, indicating that inhibition of tumor cell interaction with the vascular endothelium is critical for cancer dissemination. Thus, the small size, the stability of the C-C bond, and the chemically defined structure of the newly generated STMCs make them superior to heparin derivatives and signify STMCs as valuable candidates for further evaluation.",

The in vitro potencies and cellular anticancer mechanisms are similar for the two numonafides and amonafide. Results from several mouse models of human cancer demonstrate that AN and MEAN require slightly higher doses than amonafide for equal efficacy in short-term dosing models, but the same dose of all three compounds in long-term dosing models are equally efficacious. MEAN is tolerated much better than amonafide and AN at equally efficacious doses based on weight change, activity, stool consistency, and dose tolerance with survival as the end point. The studies presented here demonstrate that MEAN is much less toxic than amonafide or AN in mouse models of human liver and gastric cancers while being equally efficacious in vivo and inhibiting cancer cells through similar mechanisms.

However, the biologic function of p38\u03b3 MAPK in breast cancer has not been well defined. In this study, we have shown that p38\u03b3 MAPK is overexpressed in highly metastatic human and mouse breast cancer cell lines and p38\u03b3 MAPK expression is preferentially associated with basal-like and metastatic phenotypes of breast tumor samples. Ectopic expression of p38\u03b3 MAPK did not lead to an increase in oncogenic properties in vitro in most tested mammary epithelial cells. However, knockdown of p38\u03b3 MAPK expression resulted in a dramatic decrease in cell proliferation, colony formation, cell migration, invasion in vitro and significant retardation of tumorigenesis, and long-distance metastasis to the lungs in vivo. Moreover, knockdown of p38\u03b3 MAPK triggered the activation of AKT signaling. Inhibition of this feedback loop with various PI3K/AKT signaling inhibitors facilitated the effect of targeting p38\u03b3 MAPK. We further found that overexpression of p38\u03b3 MAPK did not promote cell resistance to chemotherapeutic agents doxorubicin and paclitaxel but significantly increased cell resistance to PJ-34, a DNA damage agent poly (ADP-ribose)-polymerase-1 (PARP) inhibitor in vitro and in vivo.

Its high mortality rate (68%) reflects the fact that 75% of patients have extensive (>stage III) disease at diagnosis and also the limited efficacy of currently available therapies. Consequently, there is clearly a great need to develop improved upfront and salvage therapies for ovarian cancer. Here, we investigated the efficacy of metformin alone and in combination with cisplatin in vivo. A2780 ovarian cancer cells were injected intraperitoneally in nude mice; A2780-induced tumors in nude mice, when treated with metformin in drinking water, resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth, accompanied by inhibition of tumor cell proliferation (as assessed by immunohistochemical staining of Ki-67, Cyclin D1) as well as decreased live tumor size and mitotic cell count. Metformin-induced activation of AMPK/mTOR pathway was accompanied by decreased microvessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor expression. More importantly, metformin treatment inhibited the growth of metastatic nodules in the lung and significantly potentiated cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity resulting in approximately 90% reduction in tumor growth compared with treatment by either of the drugs alone. Collectively, our data show for the first time that, in addition to inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, metformin treatment inhibits both angiogenesis and metastatic spread of ovarian cancer. Overall, our study provides a strong rationale for use of metformin in ovarian cancer treatment.",

Because the distribution of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and PS within the membrane is coregulated, we reasoned that PE would also be localized in the outer membrane leaflet of tumor EC. To demonstrate this, the PE-binding peptide duramycin was biotinylated and used to determine the distribution of PE on EC in vitro and in vivo. Exposure of cultured EC to hypoxia, acidity, reactive oxygen species, or irradiation resulted in the formation of membrane blebs that were intensely PE-positive. When biotinylated duramycin was intravenously injected into tumor-bearing mice, it preferentially localized to the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium. Depending on tumor type, 13% to 56% of the tumor vessels stained positive for PE. PE-positive vessels were observed in and around hypoxic regions of the tumor. With the exception of intertubular vessels of the kidney, normal vessels remained unstained. To test the potential of PE as a biomarker for imaging, duramycin was conjugated to the near-infrared fluorophore 800CW and used for optical imaging of RM-9 prostate carcinomas. The near-infrared probe was easily detected within tumors in live animals.

We previously showed that nabpaclitaxel (nanoparticle albumin-embedded paclitaxel) combined with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) antibody, bevacizumab, eradicates orthotopic small-sized breast tumors and metastasis. Here, we assessed this therapy in two models of advanced (450\u2013600 mm3) breast tumors and delineated VEGF-A-dependent mechanisms of tumor resistance.Methods Mice with luciferase-tagged advanced MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 tumors were treated with saline, nab-paclitaxel (10 or 30 mg/kg), bevacizumab (4 mg/kg), or combined drugs. Lymphatic and lung metastases were measured by luciferase assay. Proinflammatory and survival pathways were measured by ELISA, Western blot and immunohistochemistry.Results Nab-paclitaxel transiently suppressed primary tumors by 70% to 90% but had no effect on metastasis. Coadministration of bevacizumab increased the response rate to 99%, including 71% of complete responses in MDA-MB-231-bearing mice treated concurrently with 30 mg/kg of nab-paclitaxel. This combinatory regimen significantly reduced or eliminated preexisting lymphatic and distant metastases in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 models. The mechanism involves paclitaxel-induced NF-\u03baB pathway that upregulates VEGF-A and other tumor prosurvival proteins.Conclusions Bevacizumab prevents tumor recurrence and metastasis promoted by nab-paclitaxel activation of NF-\u03baB pathway. Combination therapy with high-dosed nab-paclitaxel demonstrates the potential to eradicate advanced primary tumors and preexisting metastases. These findings strongly support translating this regimen into clinics.",

     "abstract": "Chromosomal instability leading to aneuploidy occurs in most sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) and is believed to be an early driving force in disease progression. Despite this observation, the cellular advantages conferred by these cytogenetic alterations are poorly understood. Here, we provide evidence that serum-free passage of originally diploid, immortalized human colonic epithelial cells (HCECs) gave rise to the acquisition of trisomy 7 (+7), an aneuploidy detected in more than 40% of colorectal adenomas. These cells remain diploid under long-term growth in 2% serum conditions. Analysis by GTG banding and fluorescent in situ hybridization detected no rare preexisting +7 cell in the original population, suggesting a conversion of diploid cells to an aneuploid state. The acquisition of +7 also precedes loss or truncation of the adenomatosis polyposis coli gene as both diploid and +7 cells express full-length, functional protein. Coculturing of fluorescent-labeled cells demonstrate that +7 HCECs have a growth advantage over diploid cells in serum-free conditions. Defects in cell migration and aberrant regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor, located on chromosome 7p, are also detected in +7 HCECs. Interestingly, knockdown of TP53 and expression of K-RasV12 in +7 HCECs resulted in the emergence of trisomy 20, another nonrandom aneuploidy observed in \u223c85% of CRC. In summary, we describe isogenic colonic epithelial cells that represent cytogenetic changes occurring frequently in sporadic CRC. The emergence and characterization of trisomy 7 and 20 demonstrate that these HCECs may serve as unique human cell-based models to examine the effects of chromosomal instability in CRC progression.",

Studies from our laboratory as well as others have shown that the growth-promoting activities of G\u03b112 and G\u03b113 involve potent activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs). Our previous studies have indicated that the JNK-interacting leucine zipper protein (JLP), a scaffold protein involved in the structural and functional organization of the JNK/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase module, tethers G\u03b112 and G\u03b113 to the JNK signaling module. In the present study, in addition to demonstrating the physical association between JLP and G\u03b112, we show that this interaction is enhanced by the receptor- or mutation-mediated activation of G\u03b112. We also establish that JLP interacts with G\u03b112 through the C-terminal domain that has been previously identified to be involved in binding to G\u03b113. Furthermore, using this C-terminal domain as a competitively inhibitor of JLP that can disrupt G\u03b112-JLP interaction, we demonstrate that JLP is required for the stimulation of JNK by G\u03b112. Our results also indicate that such JLP interaction is required for G\u03b112 as well as G\u03b113-mediated neoplastic transformation of JLP. These studies demonstrate for the first time a functional role for JLP in the gep oncogene-regulated neoplastic signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "Medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor, arising from aberrant cerebellar precursors' development, a process mainly controlled by Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Histone deacetylase HDAC1 has been recently shown to modulate Hh signaling, deacetylating its effectors Gli1/2 and enhancing their transcriptional activity. Therefore, HDAC may represent a potential therapeutic target for Hh-dependent tumors, but still little information is available on the physiological mechanisms of HDAC regulation. The putative tumor suppressor RENKCTD11 acts through ubiquitination-dependent degradation of HDAC1, thereby affecting Hh activity and medulloblastoma growth. We identify and characterize here two RENKCTD11 homologues, defining a new family of proteins named KCASH, as \u201cKCTD containing, Cullin3 adaptor, suppressor of Hedgehog.\u201d Indeed, the novel genes (KCASH2KCTD21 and KCASH3KCTD6) share with RENKCTD11 a number of features, such as a BTB domain required for the formation of a Cullin3 ubiquitin ligase complex and HDAC1 ubiquitination and degradation capability, suppressing the acetylation-dependent Hh/Gli signaling. Expression of KCASH2 and -3 is observed in cerebellum, whereas epigenetic silencing and allelic deletion are observed in human medulloblastoma. Rescuing KCASHs expression reduces the Hedgehog-dependent medulloblastoma growth, suggesting that loss of members of this novel family of native HDAC inhibitors is crucial in sustaining Hh pathway-mediated tumorigenesis. Accordingly, they might represent a promising class of endogenous \u201cagents\u201d through which this pathway may be targeted.",

Twenty important SNPs that have the highest importance scores and lowest classification error rate were identified by the random forest algorithm to be associated with early onset of EA (age \u2264 55 years). Subsequent logistic regression analysis indicated that 10 SNPs (rs2070744 of NOS3, rs720321 of BCL2, rs17757541 of BCL2, rs11775256 of TNFRSF10A, rs1035142 of CASP8, rs2236302 of MMP14, rs4740363 of ABL1, rs696217 of GHRL, rs2445762 of CYP19A1, and rs11941492 of VEGFR2/KDR) were significantly associated with early onset of EA (\u226455 vs >55 years, all P < .05 after adjusting for co-variates and false discovery rate).

We investigated the therapeutic efficacies of metronomic S-1, an oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug, and vandetanib, an epidermal growth factor receptor and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: We compared anti-HCC effects and toxicity in the six treatment groups: control (untreated), maximum tolerated dose (MTD) S-1, metronomic S-1, vandetanib, MTD S-1 with vandetanib, and metronomic S-1 with vandetanib. Tumor microvessel density (MVD) and tumor apoptosis were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The expression of VEGF and thrombospondin-1, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, was analyzed by Western blot. Results: Metronomic S-1 significantly inhibited tumor growth, which was enhanced by combination with vandetanib. With respect to toxicities, MTD S-1 caused severe body weight loss and myelosuppression, whereas metronomic S-1 did not cause any overt toxicities. Moreover, metronomic S-1 or metronomic S-1 with vandetanib prolonged survival, the latter treatment providing the greatest benefit. Metronomic S-1 and metronomic S-1 with vandetanib decreased MVDs and increased apoptosis in tumor tissues. The expression of VEGF in tumor tissues was upregulated by vandetanib and metronomic S-1 with vandetanib, whereas the expression of thrombospondin-1 was upregulated by metronomic S-1 and metronomic S-1 with vandetanib. Conclusion: Metronomic S-1 with an antiangiogenic agent seems to be an effective and safe therapeutic strategy for HCC.",

     "abstract": "Introduction: The CD95/CD95L pathway plays a critical role in tissue homeostasis and immune system regulation; however, the function of this pathway in malignancy remains poorly understood. We hypothesized that CD95L expression in esophageal adenocarcinoma confers advantages to the neoplasm other than immune privilege. Methods: CD95L expression was characterized in immortalized squamous esophagus (HET-1A) and Barrett esophagus (BAR-T) cells; adenocarcinoma cell lines FLO-1, SEG-1, and BIC-1, and MDA468 (- control); and KFL cells (+ control). Analyses included reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunoblots of whole cell and secretory vesicle lysates, FACScan analysis, laser scanning confocal microscopy of native proteins and fluorescent constructs, and assessment of apoptosis and ERK1/2 pathways. Results: Cleaved, soluble CD95L is expressed at both the RNA and protein levels in these cell lines derived from esophageal adenocarcinoma and other human tissues. CD95L was neither trafficked to the cell membrane nor secreted into the media or within vesicles, rather the protein seems to be sequestered in the cytoplasm. CD95 and CD95L colocalize by immunofluorescence, but an interaction was not proven by immunoprecipitation. Overexpression of CD95L in the adenocarcinoma cell lines induced robust apoptosis and, under conditions of pan-caspase inhibition, resulted in activation of ERK signaling. Conclusions: CD95L localization in EA cells is inconsistent with the conference of immune privilege and is more consistent with a function that promotes tumor growth through alternative CD95 signaling. Reduced cell surface expression of CD95 affects cell sensitivity to extracellular apoptotic signals more significantly than alterations in downstream modulators of apoptosis.",

     "abstract": "Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is known to boost immune responses in the tumor microenvironment but might also contribute directly to cancer cell death. CD39/ENTPD1 is the dominant ectonucleotidase expressed by endothelial cells and regulatory T cells and catalyzes the sequential hydrolysis of ATP to AMP that is further degraded to adenosine by CD73/ecto-5\u2032-nucleotidase. We have previously shown that deletion of Cd39 results in decreased growth of transplanted tumors in mice, as a result of both defective angiogenesis and heightened innate immune responses (secondary to loss of adenosinergic immune suppression). Whether alterations in local extracellular ATP and adenosine levels as a result of CD39 bioactivity directly affect tumor growth and cytotoxicity has not been investigated to date. We show here that extracellular ATP exerts antitumor activity by directly inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cancer cell death. ATP-induced antiproliferative effects and cell death are, in large part, mediated through P2X7 receptor signaling. Tumors in Cd39 null mice exhibit increased necrosis in association with P2X7 expression. We further demonstrate that exogenous soluble NTPDase, or CD39 expression by cocultured liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, stimulates tumor cell proliferation and limits cell death triggered by extracellular ATP. Collectively, our findings indicate that local expression of CD39 directly promotes tumor cell growth by scavenging extracellular ATP. Pharmacological or targeted inhibition of CD39 enzymatic activity may find utility as an adjunct therapy in cancer management.",

Methods: Proliferation and apoptotic assays were performed on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells and pancreas cancer (MIAPaCa-2, Capan-1) cell lines exposed to SN-38, the active metabolite of irinotecan, axitinib, or their simultaneous combination for 72 hours. ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor-2, and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) concentration were measured by ELISAs. ATP7A and ABCG2 gene expression was performed with real-time polymerase chain reaction and SN-38 intracellular concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Capan-1 xenografts in nude mice were treated with irinotecan and axitinib alone or in simultaneous combination. Results: A strong synergistic effect on antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity was found with the axitinib/SN-38 combination on endothelial and cancer cells. ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation were significantly inhibited by lower concentrations of the combined drugs in all the cell lines. Axitinib and SN-38 combined treatment greatly inhibited the expression of the ATP7A and ABCG2 genes in endothelial and cancer cells, increasing the SN-38 intracellular concentration. Moreover, TSP-1 secretion was increased in cells treated with both drugs, whereas VEGFR-2 levels significantly decreased. In vivo administration of the simultaneous combination determined an almost complete regression of tumors and tumor neovascularization.

     "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment contains multiple cancer-supporting factors, whose joint activities promote malignancy. Here, we show that epidermal growth factor (EGF) and estrogen upregulate in an additive manner the transcription and the secretion of the angiogenic chemokine CXCL8 (interleukin 8 [IL-8]) in breast tumor cells. In view of published findings on cross-regulatory interactions between EGF receptors and estrogen receptors in breast tumor cells, we asked whether the additive effects of EGF and estrogen were due to their ability to (1) induce intracellular cross talk and amplify shared regulatory pathways or (2) act in independent mechanisms, which complement each other. We found that stimulation by EGF alone induced the release of CXCL8 through signaling pathways involving ErbB2, ErbB1, Erk, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). ErbB2 and Erk were also involved in estrogen activities on CXCL8 but to a lower extent than with EGF. However, in the joint stimulatory setup, the addition of estrogen to EGF has led to partial (ErbB2, ErbB1, Erk) or complete (PI3K) shutoff of the involvement of these activation pathways in CXCL8 up-regulation. Furthermore, when costimulation by EGF + estrogen was applied, the effects of estrogen were channeled to regulation of CXCL8 at the transcription level, acting through the transcription factor estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1). In parallel, in the joint stimulation, EGF acted independently at the transcription level through AP-1, to upregulate CXCL8 expression. The independent activities of EGF and estrogen on CXCL8 transcription reinforce the need to introduce simultaneous targeting of ErbBs and ER\u03b1 to achieve effective therapy in breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Recently, we have demonstrated the feasibility of using hemodynamic response imaging (HRI), a functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) method combined with hypercapnia and hyperoxia, for monitoring vascular changes during liver pathologies without the need of contrast material. In this study, we evaluated HRI ability to assess changes in liver tumor vasculature during tumor establishment, progression, and antiangiogenic therapy. Colorectal adenocarcinoma cells were injected intrasplenically to model colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) and the Mdr2 knockout mice were used to model primary hepatic tumors. Hepatic perfusion parameters were evaluated using the HRI protocol and were compared with contrast-enhanced (CE) MRI. The hypovascularity and the increased arterial blood supply in well-defined CRLM were demonstrated by HRI. In CRLM-bearing mice, the entire liver perfusion was attenuated as the HRI maps were significantly reduced by 35%. This study demonstrates that the HRI method showed enhanced sensitivity for small CRLM (1\u20132 mm) detection compared with CE-MRI (82% versus 38%, respectively). In addition, HRI could demonstrate the vasculature alteration during CRLM progression (arborized vessels), which was further confirmed by histology. Moreover, HRI revealed the vascular changes induced by rapamycin treatment. Finally, HRI facilitates primary hepatic tumor characterization with good correlation to the pathologic differentiation. The HRI method is highly sensitive to subtle hemodynamic changes induced by CRLM and, hence, can function as an imaging tool for understanding the hemodynamic changes occurring during CRLM establishment, progression, and antiangiogenic treatment. In addition, this method facilitated the differentiation between different types of hepatic lesions based on their vascular profile noninvasively.",

ARR2Pb.Stat3C x PTEN+/- mice exhibited a more severe prostate phenotype compared with ARR2Pb.Stat3C and PTEN+/- mice. ARR2Pb.Stat3C x PTEN+/- mice developed adenocarcinomas in the ventral prostate as early as 6 months (22% incidence) that reached an incidence of 61% by 12 months.

RAF265, a novel B-Raf/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 inhibitor, was evaluated in the preclinical setting for its ability to inhibit the uptake of PET tracers in the A375M(B-RafV600E) human melanoma cell line. RAF265 inhibited 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose (FDG) accumulation in cell culture at 28 hours in a dose-dependent manner. RAF265 also inhibited FDG accumulation in tumor xenografts after 1 day of drug treatment. This decrease persisted for the remaining 2 weeks of treatment. DNA microarray analysis of treated tumor xenografts revealed significantly decreased expression of genes regulating glucose and thymidine metabolism and revealed changes in apoptotic genes, suggesting that the imaging tracers FDG, 3-deoxy-3-[18F]fluorothymidine, and annexin V could serve as potential imaging biomarkers for RAF265 therapy monitoring. We concluded that RAF265 is highly efficacious in this xenograft model of human melanoma and decreases glucose metabolism as measured by DNA microarray analysis, cell culture assays, and small animal FDG PET scans as early as 1 day after treatment. Our results support the use of FDG PET in clinical trials with RAF265 to assess early tumor response. DNA microarray analysis and small animal PET studies may be used as complementary technologies in drug development. DNA microarray analysis allows for analysis of drug effects on multiple pathways linked to cancer and can suggest corresponding imaging tracers for further analysis as biomarkers of tumor response.",

The growth and survival of metastasis depend on the interaction of tumor cells with host factors in the organ microenvironment. Brain metastases are surrounded and infiltrated by activated astrocytes and are highly resistant to chemotherapy. We report here that coculture of human breast cancer cells or lung cancer cells with murine astrocytes (but not murine fibroblasts) led to the up-regulation of survival genes, including GSTA5, BCL2L1, and TWIST1, in the tumor cells. The degree of up-regulation directly correlated with increased resistance to all tested chemotherapeutic agents. We further show that the up-regulation of the survival genes and consequent resistance are dependent on the direct contact between the astrocytes and tumor cells through gap junctions and are therefore transient. Knocking down these genes with specific small interfering RNA rendered the tumor cells sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. These data clearly demonstrate that host cells in the microenvironment influence the biologic behavior of tumor cells and reinforce the contention that the organ microenvironment must be taken into consideration during the design of therapy.",

     "abstract": "A major challenge in cancer biology is to monitor and understand cancer metabolism in vivo with the goal of improved diagnosis and perhaps therapy. Because of the complexity of biochemical pathways, tracer methods are required for detecting specific enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Stable isotopes such as 13C or 15N with detection by nuclear magnetic resonance provide the necessary information about tissue biochemistry, but the crucial metabolites are present in low concentration and therefore are beyond the detection threshold of traditional magnetic resonance methods. A solution is to improve sensitivity by a factor of 10,000 or more by temporarily redistributing the populations of nuclear spins in a magnetic field, a process termed hyperpolarization. Although this effect is short-lived, hyperpolarized molecules can be generated in an aqueous solution and infused in vivo where metabolism generates products that can be imaged. This discovery lifts the primary constraint on magnetic resonance imaging for monitoring metabolism\u2014poor sensitivity\u2014while preserving the advantage of biochemical information. The purpose of this report was to briefly summarize the known abnormalities in cancer metabolism, the value and limitations of current imaging methods for metabolism, and the principles of hyperpolarization. Recent preclinical applications are described. Hyperpolarization technology is still in its infancy, and current polarizer equipment and methods are suboptimal. Nevertheless, there are no fundamental barriers to rapid translation of this exciting technology to clinical research and perhaps clinical care.",

     "abstract": "Increased expression and/or activation of H-Ras are often associated with tumor aggressiveness in breast cancer. Previously, we showed that H-Ras, but not N-Ras, induces MCF10A human breast epithelial cell invasion and migration, whereas both H-Ras and N-Ras induce cell proliferation and phenotypic transformation. In an attempt to determine the sequence requirement directing the divergent phenotype induced by H-Ras and N-Ras with a focus on the induction of human breast cell invasion, we investigated the structural and functional relationships between H-Ras and N-Ras using domain-swap and site-directed mutagenesis approaches. Here, we report that the hypervariable region (HVR), consisting of amino acids 166 to 189 in H-Ras, determines the invasive/migratory signaling program as shown by the exchange of invasive phenotype by swapping HVR sequences between H-Ras and N-Ras. We also demonstrate that the H-Ras-specific additional palmitoylation site at Cys184 is not responsible for the signaling events that distinguish between H-Ras and N-Ras. Importantly, this work identifies the C-terminal HVR, especially the flexible linker domain with two consecutive proline residues Pro173 and Pro174, as a critical domain that contributes to activation of H-Ras and its invasive potential in human breast epithelial cells. The present study sheds light on the structural basis for the Ras isoform-specific invasive program of breast epithelial cells, providing information for the development of agents that specifically target invasion-related H-Ras pathways in human cancer.",

     "abstract": "Docetaxel is currently the most effective drug for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), but it only extends life by an average of 2 months. Lycopene, an antioxidant phytochemical, has antitumor activity against prostate cancer (PCa) in several models and is generally safe. We present data on the interaction between docetaxel and lycopene in CRPC models. The growth-inhibitory effect of lycopene on PCa cell lines was positively associated with insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) levels. In addition, lycopene treatment enhanced the growth-inhibitory effect of docetaxel more effectively on DU145 cells with IGF-IR high expression than on those PCa cell lines with IGF-IR low expression. In a DU145 xenograft tumor model, docetaxel plus lycopene caused tumor regression, with a 38% increase in antitumor efficacy (P = .047) when compared with docetaxel alone. Lycopene inhibited IGF-IR activation through inhibiting IGF-I stimulation and by increasing the expression and secretion of IGF-BP3. Downstream effects include inhibition of AKT kinase activity and survivin expression, followed by apoptosis. Together, the enhancement of docetaxel's antitumor efficacy by lycopene supplementation justifies further clinical investigation of lycopene and docetaxel combination for CRPC patients. CRPC patients with IGF-IR-overexpressing tumors may be most likely to benefit from this combination.",

     "abstract": "Activation of the Ras-Raf-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway causes not only proliferation and suppression of apoptosis but also the antioncogenic response of senescence. How these contrasting effects are reconciled to achieve cell transformation and cancer formation is poorly understood. In a system of two-step carcinogenesis (dedifferentiated PC EIA, transformed PC EIA-polyoma-middle T [PC EIA + Py] and PC EIA-v-raf [PC EIA + raf] cells], v-raf cooperated with EIA by virtue of a strong prosurvival effect, not elicited by Py-middle T, evident toward serum-deprivation-and H2O2-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was detected by DNA fragmentation and annexin V staining. The prosurvival function of v-raf was, in part, mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)-dependent, as shown by pharmacological MEK inhibition. The MEK-dependent antiapoptotic effect of v-raf was exerted despite a lower level of P-ERK1/2 in EIA + raf cells with respect to EIA + Py/EIA cells, which was dependent on a high tyrosine phosphatase activity, as shown by orthovanadate blockade. An ERK1/2 tyrosine phosphatase was likely involved. The high tyrosine phosphatase activity was instrumental to the complete suppression of senescence, detected by \u03b2-galactosidase activity, because tyrosine phosphatase blockade induced senescence in EIA + raf but not in EIA + Py cells. High tyrosine phosphatase activity and evasion from senescence were confirmed in an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line. Therefore, besides EIA, EIA + raf cells suppress senescence through a new mechanism, namely, phosphatase-mediated P-ERK1/2 inhibition, but, paradoxically, retain the oncogenic effects of the Raf-ERK pathway. We propose that the survival effect of Raf is not a function of absolute P-ERK1/2 levels at a given time but is rather dynamically dependent on greater variations after an apoptotic stimulus.",

We previously demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of S100A4 by \u03b2-catenin and the importance of the interconnection of these cellular programs for metastasis. Here we probe the hypothesis that the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sulindac sulfide can inhibit colon cancer metastasis by intervening in \u03b2-catenin signaling and thereby interdicting S100A4. We treated colon cancer cell lines heterozygous for gain-of-function and wild-type \u03b2-catenin with sulindac. We analyzed sulindac's effects on \u03b2-catenin expression and subcellular localization, \u03b2-catenin binding to the T-cell factor (TCF)/S100A4 promoter complex, S100A4 promoter activity, S100A4 expression, cell motility, and proliferation. Mice intrasplenically transplanted with S100A4-overexpressing colon cancer cells were treated with sulindac. Tumor growth and metastasis, and their \u03b2-catenin and S100A4 expressions, were determined. We report the expression knockdown of \u03b2-catenin by sulindac, leading to its reduced nuclear accumulation. The binding of \u03b2-catenin to TCF was clearly lowered, resulting in reduced S100A4 promoter activity and expression. This correlated well with the inhibition of cell migration and invasion, which could be rescued by ectopic S100A4 expression. In mice, sulindac treatment resulted in reduced tumor growth in the spleen (P = .014) and decreased liver metastasis in a human colon cancer xenograft model (P = .025). Splenic tumors and liver metastases of sulindac-treated mice showed lowered \u03b2-catenin and S100A4 levels. These results suggest that modulators of \u03b2-catenin signaling such as sulindac offer potential as antimetastatic agents by interdicting S100A4 expression.",

Emerging phase 1 and 2 clinical data have shown high response rates in myxoid liposarcoma in part owing to the inhibition of the FUS-CHOP transcription factor. In this report, we show that modulation of specific oncogenic transcription factors by ET-743 may extend to other tumor types. We demonstrate that, among a panel of pediatric sarcomas, Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFTs) cell lines bearing the EWS-FLI1 transcription factor are the most sensitive to treatment with ET-743 compared with osteosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. We show that ET-743 reverses a gene signature of induced downstream targets of EWS-FLI1 in two different ESFT cell lines (P = .001). In addition, ET-743 directly suppresses the promoter activity of a known EWS-FLI1 downstream target NR0B1 luciferase reporter construct without changing the activity of a constitutively active control in ESFT cells. Furthermore, the effect is specific to EWS-FLI1, as forced expression of EWS-FLI1 in a cell type that normally lacks this fusion protein, HT1080 cells, induces the same NR0B1 promoter, but this activation is completely blocked by ET-743 treatment. Finally, we used gene set enrichment analysis to confirm that other mechanisms of ET-743 are active in ESFT cells. These results suggest a particular role for ET-743 in the treatment of translocation-positive tumors. In addition, the modulation of EWS-FLI1 makes it a novel targeting agent for ESFT and suggests that further development of this compound for the treatment of ESFT is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer is heterogeneous, and the biology of this disease has remained poorly understood. Molecular apocrine is a subtype of ER-negative breast cancer that is characterized by the overexpression of steroid-response genes such as AR and a high rate of ErbB2 amplification. In this study, we have identified a positive feedback loop between the AR and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathways in molecular apocrine breast cancer. In this process, AR regulates ERK phosphorylation and kinase activity. In addition, AR inhibition results in the down-regulation of ERK target proteins phospho-RSK1, phospho-Elk-1, and c-Fos using an in vivo molecular apocrine model. Furthermore, we show that AR-mediated induction of ERK requires ErbB2, and AR activity, in turn, regulates ErbB2 expression as an AR target gene. These findings suggest that ErbB2 is an upstream connector between the AR and ERK signaling pathways. Another feature of this feedback loop is an ERK-mediated regulation of AR. In this respect, the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation reduces AR expression and CREB1-mediated transcriptional regulation of AR acts as a downstream connector between the AR and ERK signaling pathways in molecular apocrine cells. Finally, we demonstrate that AR-positive staining is associated with the overexpression of ERK signaling targets phospho-Elk-1 and c-Fos in ER-negative breast tumors, which further supports a cross-regulation between the AR and ERK signaling pathways in molecular apocrine subtype. This study demonstrates an AR-ERK feedback loop in ER-negative breast cancer with significant biologic and therapeutic implications in this disease.",

     "abstract": "Potential treatments for ovarian cancers that have become resistant to standard chemotherapies include modulators of tumor cell survival, such as endothelin receptor (ETR) antagonist. We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of the dual ETR antagonist, macitentan, on human ovarian cancer cells, SKOV3ip1 and IGROV1, growing orthotopically in nude mice. Mice with established disease were treated with vehicle (control), paclitaxel (weekly, intraperitoneal injections), macitentan (daily oral administrations), or a combination of paclitaxel and macitentan. Treatment with paclitaxel decreased tumor weight and volume of ascites. Combination therapy with macitentan and paclitaxel reduced tumor incidence and further reduced tumor weight and volume of ascites when compared with paclitaxel alone. Macitentan alone occasionally reduced tumor weight but alone had no effect on tumor incidence or ascites. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that treatment with macitentan and macitentan plus paclitaxel inhibited the phosphorylation of ETRs and suppressed the survival pathways of tumor cells by decreasing the levels of pVEGFR2, pAkt, and pMAPK. The dose of macitentan necessary for inhibition of phosphorylation correlated with the dose required to increase antitumor efficacy of paclitaxel. Treatment with macitentan enhanced the cytotoxicity mediated by paclitaxel as measured by the degree of apoptosis in tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells. Collectively, these results show that administration of macitentan in combination with paclitaxel prevents the progression of ovarian cancer in the peritoneal cavity of nude mice in part by inhibiting survival pathways of both tumor cells and tumor-associated endothelial cells.",

     "publication date": "02-2011",
     "abstract": "Background: Pancreatic cancer is among the most dismal of human malignancies. The 5-year survival rate is lower than 5%. The identification of precursor lesions would be the main step to improve this fatal outcome. One precursor lesions are called pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and are graduated in grade 1 to 3, whereas grade 3 is classified as carcinoma in situ. Currently, no reliable, noninvasive imaging technique (e.g., ultrasound, computed tomography, magnet resonance imaging) exists to verify PanINs. Methods: Recently, a transgenic mouse model of pancreatic cancer was established in which the tumor progression of human pancreatic carcinoma is reproduced. These so-called Pdx-1-Cre; LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+mice develop PanINs, which transform to invasive growing pancreatic carcinoma. The pancreata of mice of different ages were immunohistochemically stained using \u03b1-GLUT-2 antibodies. Furthermore, mice underwent positron emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to evaluate early detection of PanIN lesions. Results: An expression of GLUT-2 in murine PanINs was found in PanINs of grade 1B and higher. This finding is associated with an elevated glucose metabolism, leading to the detection of precursor lesions of pancreatic cancer in the FDG PET-CT scan. In addition, immunohistochemical staining of GLUT-2 was detectable in 45 (75%) of 60 human PanINs, whereas PanINs of grade 1B and higher showed a very extensive expression. Conclusions: In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that an elevated glucose metabolism occurs already in precursor lesions of murine and human pancreatic carcinoma. These findings are the basis for the detection of precursor lesions by PET-CT, thereby helping improving the prognosis of this devastating disease.",

In this study, we have used a potent and selective ALK small molecule inhibitor, NPV-TAE684, to assess the oncogenic role of EML4-ALK in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We show here that TAE684 inhibits proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and tumor regression in two NSCLC models that harbor EML4-ALK fusions.

We used microarray analysis to carry out targeted pathway studies of gene expression changes in H2228 NSCLC xenograft model after TAE684 treatment and identified a gene signature of EML4-ALK inhibition. The gene signature represents 1210 known human genes, and the top biologic processes represented by these genes are cell cycle, DNA synthesis, cell proliferation, and cell death. We also compared the effect of TAE684 with PF2341066, a c-Met and ALK small molecule inhibitor currently in clinical trial in cancers harboring ALK fusions, and demonstrated that TAE684 is a much more potent inhibitor of EML4-ALK.

However, clinical trials have shown little activity for EGFR inhibitors in mesothelioma. Despite the evidence for RTK activation in mesothelioma pathogenesis, it is unclear whether transforming activity is dependent on an individual kinase oncoprotein or the coordinated activity of multiple kinases. Using phospho-RTK and immunoblot assays, we herein demonstrate activation of multiple RTKs (EGFR, MET, AXL, and ERBB3) in individual mesothelioma cell lines but not in normal mesothelioma cells. Inhibition of mesothelioma multi-RTK signaling was accomplished using combinations of RTK direct inhibitors or by inhibition of the RTK chaperone, heat shock protein 90 (HSP90). Multi-RTK inhibition by the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allyloamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) had a substantially greater effect on mesothelioma proliferation and survival compared with inhibition of individual activated RTKs. HSP90 inhibition also suppressed phosphorylation of down-stream signaling intermediates (AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and S6); upregulated the p53, p21, and p27 cell cycle checkpoints; induced G2 phase arrest; induced caspase 3/7 activity; and led to an increase in the sub-G1 apoptotic population. These compelling proapoptotic and antiproliferative responses indicate that HSP90 inhibition warrants clinical evaluation as a novel therapeutic strategy in mesothelioma.",

The link between macrophage infiltration and the uPA/uPAR axis in prostate cancer development has not been established, although it has been reported that uPA plays a critical role in monocyte and macrophage chemotaxis. In this study, murine prostate cancer RM-1 cells were subcutaneously inoculated into wild-type (WT), uPA\u2212/\u2212, and uPAR\u2212/\u2212 mice.

It is characterized primarily, but not exclusively, by antiangiogenic mechanisms of action and the absence of high-grade adverse effects commonly seen with MTD chemotherapy. However, similar to other anticancer therapies, inherent resistance to LDM chemotherapy is common. Moreover, even tumors that initially respond to metronomic regimens eventually develop resistance through mechanisms that are as yet unknown. Thus, we have developed in vivo models of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells resistant to extended LDM cyclophosphamide therapy. Such PC-3 variants show stable resistance to LDM cyclophosphamide in vivo yet retain in vitro sensitivity to 4-hydroperoxy-cyclophosphamide (precursor of the active cyclophosphamide metabolite 4-hydroxy-cyclophosphamide) and other chemotherapeutic agents, namely, docetaxel and doxorubicin.

Conversely, PC-3 variants made resistant in vivo to MTD cyclophosphamide show varying levels of resistance to metronomic cyclophosphamide when grown in mice. These results and additional studies of variants of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 suggest that resistance to LDM cyclophosphamide is a distinct phenomenon from resistance to MTD cyclophosphamide and that LDM cyclophosphamide administration does not select for MTD chemotherapy resistance. As such, our findings have various implications for the clinical use of metronomic chemotherapy.",

Targeting non\u2013endothelial stromal cells to further impact tumor cell growth and survival is being pursued through the inhibition of additional growth factor pathways important for the survival and/or proliferation of these cells. However, recent data suggest that VEGF receptor (VEGFR)\u2013specific inhibitors may target lymphatic vessels and pericytes in addition to blood vessels. Here, in fact, we demonstrate that DC101 (40 mg/kg, thrice a week), an antibody specific to murine VEGFR2, significantly reduces all three of these stromal components in subcutaneous (SKRC-29) and orthotopic (786-O-LP) models of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) established in nu/nu athymic mice. Sunitinib (40 mg/kg, once daily), a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor of VEGFR2 and other growth factor receptors, also caused significant loss of tumor blood vessels in RCC models but had weaker effects than DC101 on pericytes and lymphatic vessels. In combination, sunitinib did not significantly add to the effects of DC101 on tumor blood vessels, lymphatic vessels, or pericytes. Nevertheless, sunitinib increased the effect of DC101 on tumor burden in the SKRC-29 model, perhaps related to its broader specificity. Our data have important implications for combination therapy design, supporting the conclusion that targeting VEGFR2 alone in RCC has the potential to have pleiotropic effects on tumor stroma.",

Recently, the molecular basis for these effects has started to be elucidated, and the upregulation of the lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) isoform of lactate dehydrogenase is felt to be a major molecular mediator of this phenomenon. Moreover, LDH-A expression in tumor tissue and LDH-A levels in blood portend a bad prognosis, and LDH-A blockade can lead to tumor growth inhibition in tumor transplant models. We have extended existing data (some of which were published during the time when we were carrying out our studies) in two important ways: 1) inhibition of LDH-A in a glycolytic lung cancer cell line results in reactive oxygen species\u2013 mediated apoptosis and increased sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel and 2) inhibition of fermentative glycolysis can also be accomplished by activation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by the drug dichloroacetate, now undergoing clinical trials, and that this phenomenon can be monitored in vivo in a noninvasive real-time manner through magnetic resonance spectroscopy using hyperpolarized pyruvate. Collectively, these data suggest that in vivo effects of drugs that redirect the fate of pyruvate, and hence are aimed at reversing the Warburg effect, could be monitored through the use of hyperpolarized magnetic resonance spectroscopy, a method that is scalable to human use.",

We used the novel COXEN informatic approach for in silico drug discovery and identified NSC-637993 and NSC-645809 (C1311), both imidazoacridinones, as agents with high-predicted activity in human bladder cancer. Because even highly effective monotherapy is unlikely to cure most patients with metastasis and NSC-645809 is undergoing clinical trials in other tumor types, we sought to develop the basis for use of C1311 in rational combination with other agents in bladder cancer. Here, we demonstrate in 40 human bladder cancer cells that the in vitro cytotoxicity profile for C1311 correlates with that of NSC-637993 and compares favorably to that of standard of care chemotherapeutics. Using genomewide patterns of synthetic lethality of C1311 with open reading frame knockouts in budding yeast, we determined that combining C1311 with a taxane could provide mechanistically rational combinations. To determine the preclinical relevance of these yeast findings, we evaluated C1311 singly and in doublet combination with paclitaxel in human bladder cancer in the in vivo hollow fiber assay and observed efficacy. By applying COXEN to gene expression data from 40 bladder cancer cell lines and 30 human tumors with associated clinical response data to platinum-based chemotherapy, we provide evidence that signatures of C1311 sensitivity exist within nonresponders to this regimen. Coupling COXEN and yeast chemigenomics provides rational combinations with C1311 and tumor genomic signatures that can be used to select bladder cancer patients for clinical trials with this agent.",

We analyzed a promoter/enhancer region (2k\u0394N) that drives the predominant expression of \u0394Np63 for sensitivity to Smad signaling pathways. Reporter assays in HepG2 cells showed a moderate activation of 2k\u0394N by Smad2 and I\u03baB kinase \u03b1 (IKK\u03b1), partners of the newly identified keratinocyte-specific transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) signaling, but not by other Smad molecules. In A431 cells, 2k\u0394N was activated by Smad2 and IKK\u03b1, for which a Smad binding element (SMD2) at -204 was essential. Binding of Smad2 to the chromosomal SMD2 site was detectable. The association of Smad2 with IKK\u03b1 was evident in the nucleus of A431, accounting for the enhancement of \u0394Np63 expression by TGF-\u03b2. Moreover, both \u0394Np63 and IKK\u03b1 were necessary to maintain the noninvasive phenotype of this cell line. FaDu, an invasive, Smad4-deficient SCC, also allowed 2k\u0394N transactivation by transfected Smad2 in the presence of endogenous IKK\u03b1. Reflecting the lack of chromosomal SMD2-Smad2 association and the absence of nuclear IKK\u03b1, however, endogenous \u0394Np63 was not controlled by TGF-\u03b2 or IKK\u03b1 in FaDu. SCC tissue arrays showed nuclear accumulation of IKK\u03b1 and p63 intensification in well-differentiated noninvasive lesions.

In this study, we propose a novel combination of Dex plus radiation that shows superior clonogenic cell killing and apoptosis of myeloma cells and selectively eliminates myeloma cells when cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Dex was found to inhibit the release of interleukin-6 from irradiated BMSCs, which is an established myeloma cell proproliferative cytokine. In 5TGM1 model, the combination of Dex with skeletal targeted radiotherapy (153-Sm-EDTMP) prolonged median survival time and inhibited radiation-induced myelosuppression. A two-cycle treatment of Dex plus 153-Sm-EDTMP was well tolerated and further improved median survival time. Mechanistically, Dex increased superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production and augmented radiation-induced oxidative stress and cell death of myeloma cells. In contrast, Dex inhibited radiation-induced increase in pro-oxidant levels and enhanced the clonogenic survival in normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Treatment with either N-acetylcysteine or the combination of polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase, and PEG-catalase significantly protected myeloma cells from Dex-induced clonogenic death. Overall, these results demonstrate that Dex in combination with radiotherapy enhances the killing of myeloma cells while protecting normal bone marrow hematopoiesis through a mechanism that involves selective increases in oxidative stress.",

We hypothesized that changes in gene expression profiles within the histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium of BRCA1 mutation carriers would overlap with the expression profiles in BRCA1-mutated ovarian carcinomas and represent a BRCA1 preneoplastic signature. Laser capture microdissection of frozen sections was used to isolate neoplastic cells or histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium, and expression profiles were generated on Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 gene expression arrays. Normal-risk controls were 11 women wild type for BRCA1 and BRCA2 (WT-FT). WT-FT were compared with histologically normal fallopian tube epithelium from seven women with deleterious BRCA1 mutations who had foci of at least intraepithelial neoplasm within their fallopian tube (B1-FTocc). WT-FT samples were also compared with 12 BRCA1 ovarian carcinomas (B1-CA). The comparison of WT-FT versus B1-FTocc resulted in 152 differentially expressed probe sets, and the comparison of WT-FT versus B1-CA resulted in 4079 differentially expressed probe sets. The BRCA1 preneoplastic signature was composed of the overlap between these two lists, which included 41 concordant probe sets. Genes in the BRCA1 preneoplastic signature included several known tumor suppressor genes such as CDKN1C and EFEMP1 and several thought to be important in invasion and metastasis such as E2F3.

     "abstract": "RalA expression in human prostate cancer is associated with cell migration and is necessary for bone metastasis. However, the downstream effectors of RalA that mediate these functions remain unclear. Here we examined cell migration after small interfering RNA-mediated depletion of Ral effectors Ral binding protein 1 (RalBP1/RLIP), exocyst complex component 2 (Sec5), and phospholipase D1 (PLD1) and found that RalBP1 and RalA depletion inhibited cell migration to a similar extent. Stable lentivirus short hairpin interfering RNA-mediated depletion of RalA and RalBP1 in PC3 human prostate cancer cells inhibited bone metastasis after intracardiac inoculation. Depletion of RalBP1 diminished orthotopic tumor growth of PC3 cells and inhibited spontaneous metastasis from this site. Interestingly, the expression of wild-type or RalA mutants deficient in RalBP1 binding was effective at rescuing the reduced metastatic capacity of RalA-depleted PC3 cells, suggesting that RalA depletion does not reduce this solely by diminished interaction with RalBP1. To determine whether the role of RalBP1 in metastasis is relevant beyond prostate cancer, we studied the requirement of RalBP1 expression in an experimental metastasis model of human bladder cancer, a tumor type with high RalBP1 expression. Depletion of RalBP1 in UMUC3 cells resulted in decreased lung colonization while having a minimal effect on subcutaneous tumor growth. Our studies are the first to suggest that the expression of RalBP1 is necessary for human cancer cell metastasis. Furthermore, we show that the requirement for RalA expression for manifestation of this phenotype is not entirely dependent on a RalA-RalBP1 interaction.",

We report here that Na+/H+ exchanger 3 regulating factor 1 (NHERF1)/EBP50, an adaptor molecule that interacts with \u03b2-catenin, undergoes successive alterations during the colorectal adenoma-to-carcinoma transition, ranging from loss of normal apical membrane distribution to ectopic cytoplasmic overexpression. NHERF1 depletion in human intestinal epithelial polarized cells induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition, \u03b2-catenin nuclear translocation with elevation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin transcriptional targets, and increased cell migration and invasion. Ectopic cytoplasmic NHERF1 expression additionally intensified the transformed phenotype by increasing cell proliferation. The epithelial morphology and reduced cell motility could only be restored by re-expression of NHERF1 specifically at the apical plasma membrane. We conclude that alterations in the apical membrane localization of NHERF1 contribute to CRC through the disruption of epithelial morphology.

Although its nitric oxide-modified derivative saquinavir-NO (saq-NO) was less toxic to normal cells, it exerted stronger inhibition of B16 melanoma growth in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice than saquinavir did. Saq-NO has been shown to block proliferation, upregulate p53 expression, and promote differentiation of C6 glioma and B16 cells. The anticancer activity of substances is frequently hampered by cancer cell chemoresistance mechanisms. Therefore, we here investigated the roles of p53 and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp), multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), and breast cancer resistance protein 1 (BCRP1) in cancer cell sensitivity to saq-NO to get more information about the potential of saq-NO as anticancer drug. Saq-NO exerted anticancer effects in lower concentrations than saquinavir in a panel of human cancer cell lines. Neither p53 mutation or depletion nor expression of P-gp, MRP1, or BCRP1 affected anticancer activity of saq-NO or saquinavir. Moreover, saq-NO sensitized P-gp-, MRP1-, or BCRP1-expressing cancer cells to chemotherapy. Saq-NO induced enhanced sensitization of P-gp- or MRP1-expressing cancer cells to chemotherapy compared with saquinavir, whereas both substances similarly sensitized BCRP1-expressing cells. Washout kinetics and ABC transporter ATPase activities demonstrated that saq-NO is a substrate of P-gp as well as of MRP1. These data support the further investigation of saq-NO as an anticancer drug, especially in multidrug-resistant tumors.",

Conventional chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-polymerase chain reaction and ChIP followed by DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed direct binding of ERG to ETS binding sites in the TFF3 promoter in ERG-rearranged prostate cancer cell lines. These results were confirmed in ERG-rearranged hormone-naive prostate cancer (HNPC) and CRPC tissue samples. Functional studies demonstrated that ERG has an inhibitory effect on TFF3 expression in hormone-naive cancer but not in the castration-resistant state. In addition, we provide evidence suggesting an effect of androgen receptor signaling on ERG-regulated TFF3 expression.

Neutralization of secreted TFF3 by antibody promoted apoptosis, decreased cell growth in vitro, and arrested mammary carcinoma xenograft growth. TFF3 expression was significantly correlated to decreased survival of estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Forced expression of TFF3 in mammary carcinoma cells increased ER transcriptional activity, promoted estrogen-independent growth, and produced resistance to tamoxifen and fulvestrant in vitro and to tamoxifen in xenograft models. siRNA-mediated depletion or antibody inhibition of TFF3 significantly enhanced the efficacy of antiestrogens. Increased TFF3 expression was observed in tamoxifen-resistant (TAMR) cells and antibody inhibition of TFF3 in TAMR cells improved tamoxifen sensitivity.

In addition, the inadvertent use of mice without MUC may confound therapeutic studies by making treatments seem falsely efficacious. We assessed both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fecal biomarkers in Helicobacter- and sham-inoculated mice as methods of noninvasively detecting MUC before the predicted onset of disease. Non-contrast-enhanced MRI was able to detect lesions in 58% of mice with histologically confirmed MUC; however, serial imaging sessions produced inconsistent results. MRI was also a labor- and time-intensive technique requiring anesthesia. Alternatively, inflammatory biomarkers isolated from feces at early time points were correlated to later histologic lesions. Fecal expression of interleukin 1\u03b2, macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b1, and regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed, and secreted at 3 weeks PI correlated significantly with lesion severity at 9 weeks PI.

GATA6 bound to the uPA gene regulatory sequences in vivo and activated uPA promoter activity in vitro. uPA promoter deletion analysis indicated that the promoter proximal Sp1 sites were required for GATA6 activation of the uPA promoter. Accordingly, GATA6 physically associated with Sp1 and siRNA knockdown of Sp1 decreased GATA6 activation of the uPA promoter activity suggesting that Sp1 recruits GATA6 to the uPA promoter and mediates GATA6 induced activation of the uPA promoter activity.

     "abstract": "Core-binding factor leukemia (CBFL) is a subgroup of acutemyeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by genetic mutations involving the subunits of the core-binding factor (CBF). The leukemogenesis model for CBFL posits that one, or more, gene mutations inducing increased cell proliferation and/or inhibition of apoptosis cooperate with CBF mutations for leukemia development. One of the most commonmutations associated with CBF mutations involves the KIT receptor. A high expression of KIT is a hallmark of a high proportion of CBFL. Previous studies indicate that microRNA (MIR) 222/221 targets the 3\u2032 untranslated region of the KIT messenger RNA and our observation that AML1 can bind the MIR-222/221 promoter, we hypothesized that MIR-222/221 represents the link between CBF and KIT. Here, we show that MIR-222/221 expression is upregulated after myeloid differentiation of normal bone marrow AC133+ stem progenitor cells. CBFL blasts with either t(8;21) or inv(16) CBF rearrangements with high expression levels of KIT (CD117) display a significantly lower level of MIR-222/221 expression than non-CBFL blasts. Consistently, we found that the t(8;21) AML1-MTG8 fusion protein binds the MIR-222/221 promoter and induces transcriptional repression of a MIR-222/221-LUC reporter. Because of the highly conserved sequence homology, we demonstrated concomitant MIR-222/221 down-regulation and KIT up-regulation in the 32D/WT1 mouse cell model carrying the AML1-MTG16 fusion protein. This study provides the first hint that CBFL-associated fusion proteins may lead to up-regulation of the KIT receptor by down-regulating MIR-222/221, thus explaining the concomitant occurrence of CBF genetic rearrangements and overexpression of wild type or mutant KIT in AML.",

     "abstract": "Aneuploidy is among the most obvious differences between normal and cancer cells. However, mechanisms contributing to development and maintenance of aneuploid cell growth are diverse and incompletely understood. Functional genomics analyses have shown that aneuploidy in cancer cells is correlated with diffuse gene expression signatures and aneuploidy can arise by a variety of mechanisms, including cytokinesis failures, DNA endoreplication, and possibly through polyploid intermediate states. To identify molecular processes contributing to development of aneuploidy, we used a cell spot microarray technique to identify genes inducing polyploidy and/or allowing maintenance of polyploid cell growth in breast cancer cells. Of 5760 human genes screened, 177 were found to induce severe DNA content alterations on prolonged transient silencing. Association with response to DNA damage stimulus and DNA repair was found to be the most enriched cellular processes among the candidate genes. Functional validation analysis of these genes highlighted GINS2 as the highest ranking candidate inducing polyploidy, accumulation of endogenous DNA damage, and impairing cell proliferation on inhibition. The cell growth inhibition and induction of polyploidy by suppression of GINS2 was verified in a panel of breast cancer cell lines. Bioinformatic analysis of published gene expression and DNA copy number studies of clinical breast tumors suggested GINS2 to be associated with the aggressive characteristics of a subgroup of breast cancers in vivo. In addition, nuclear GINS2 protein levels distinguished actively proliferating cancer cells suggesting potential use of GINS2 staining as a biomarker of cell proliferation as well as a potential therapeutic target.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of these apparently inconsistent observations and to reveal possible links between them. Xenografted tumors of nine melanoma cell lines established from patients with diseases differing in aggressiveness were studied. The aggressiveness of the cell lines was assessed by measuring their lung colonization potential, invasiveness, angiogenic potential, and tumorigenicity. Spontaneous metastasis was assessed in untreated mice and mice treated with neutralizing antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) or interleukin 8 (IL-8). Microvascular density was scored in histologic preparations. Hypoxic fractions were measured by using a radiobiologic assay and a pimonidazole-based immunohistochemical assay. The aggressiveness of the melanoma lines reflected the aggressiveness of the donor patients' tumors. The metastatic propensity was associated with the microvascular density but not with the hypoxic fraction. Anti-VEGF-A and anti-IL-8 treatments resulted in decreased microvascular density and reduced incidence of metastases in all lines. Large hypoxic fractions were not a secondary effect of high cellular aggressiveness, whereas the microvascular density was associated with the cellular aggressiveness. The metastatic propensity was governed by the angiogenic potential of the tumor cells. The differences in microvascular density among the lines were most likely a consequence of differences in the constitutive angiogenic potential rather than differences in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis. VEGF-A and IL-8 may be important therapeutic targets for melanoma.",

     "abstract": "Type I and type II classes of interferons (IFNs) signal through the JAK/STAT1 pathway and are known to be important in adaptive and innate immune responses and in protection against tumors. Although STAT1 is widely considered a tumor suppressor, it remains unclear, however, if this function occurs in tumor cells (cell autonomous) or if STAT1 acts primarily through immune cells. Here, the question of whether STAT1 has a cell autonomous role in mammary tumor formation was addressed in a mouse model of ERBB2/neu-induced breast cancer in the absence and presence of STAT1. For this purpose, mice that carry floxed Stat1 alleles, which permit cell-specific removal of STAT1, were generated. To induce tumors only in mammary cells lacking STAT1, Stat1 floxed mice were crossed with transgenic mice that express cre recombinase and the neu oncogene under the mouse mammary tumor virus LTR (Stat1fl/fl NIC). Stat1 was effectively deleted in mammary epithelium of virgin Stat1fl/fl NIC females. Time-to-tumor onset was significantly shorter in Stat1fl/fl NIC females than in WT NIC (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P = .02). The median time-to-tumor onset in the Stat1fl/fl NIC mice was 49.4 weeks, whereas it was 62.4 weeks in the WT NIC mice. These results suggest that STAT1 in mammary epithelial cells may play a role in suppressing tumorigenesis. The Stat1 floxed allele described in this study is also a unique resource to determine the cellular targets of IFNs and STAT1 action, which should aid our understanding and appreciation of these pathways.",

Vaccination of rSeV/dF-GFP-DC was highly effective at preventing lung metastasis after intravenous loading of R-3327 tumor cells, compared with the effects observed with immature DCs or lipopolysaccharide-activated DCs. Interestingly, neither CTL activity nor DC trafficking showed any apparent difference among groups. Notably, rSeV/dF-DCs expressing a dominant-negative mutant of retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (rSeV/dF-RIGIC-DC), an RNA helicase that recognizes the rSeV genome for inducing type I interferons, largely lost the expression of proinflammatory cytokines without any impairment of antitumor activity. These results indicate the essential role of RIG-I-independent signaling on antimetastatic effect induced by rSeV-activated DCs and may provide important insights to DC-based immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.",

     "abstract": "Expression of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF-8) is commonly increased in prostate cancer. Experimental studies have provided evidence that it plays a role in prostate tumorigenesis and tumor progression. To study how increased FGF-8 affects the prostate, we generated and analyzed transgenic (TG) mice expressing FGF-8b under the probasin promoter that targets expression to prostate epithelium. Prostates of the TG mice showed an increased size and changes in stromal and epithelialmorphology progressing fromatypia and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mouse PIN, mPIN) lesions to tumors with highly variable phenotype bearing features of adenocarcinoma, carcinosarcoma, and sarcoma. The development of mPIN lesions was preceded by formation of activated stroma containing increased proportion of fibroblastic cells, rich vasculature, and inflammation. The association between advancing stromal and epithelial alterations was statistically significant. Microarray analysis and validation with quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that expression of osteopontin and connective tissue growth factor was markedly upregulated in TG mouse prostates compared with wild type prostates. Androgen receptor staining was decreased in transformed epithelium and in hypercellular stroma but strongly increased in the sarcoma-like lesions. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that disruption of FGF signaling pathways by increased epithelial production of FGF-8b leads to strongly activated and atypical stroma, which precedes development of mPIN lesions and prostate cancer with mixed features of adenocarcinoma and sarcoma in the prostates of TG mice. The results suggest that increased FGF-8 in human prostate may also contribute to prostate tumorigenesis by stromal activation.",

Three different xenograft models were studied using human Hep3B HCC cells, which are highly responsive to sorafenib, namely, orthotopic and subcutaneous transplant in severe combined immunodeficient mice, and an orthotopic transplant in nude mice. The complementary DNA for the \u03b2-subunit of human choriogonadotropin was transfected into HCC cells, and urine levels of the protein were monitored as a surrogate of tumor burden. Extended daily treatments, sometimes interrupted by a break period of 3 to 7 days to allow recovery from toxicity at sorafenib doses of 30 to 60 mg/kg, were maintained until and after evidence of tumor relapse. Initially responsive tumors seemed to develop a resistance-like phenotype after long-term daily treatment (e.g., >42 days) at doses of 30 to 60 mg/kg. Transplantation of cell lines established from progressing tumors into new hosts showed that the resistant phenotype was not propagated. Furthermore, a regimen of daily metronomic uracil + tegafur (UFT, an oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug) chemotherapy with a less toxic regimen of sorafenib (15 mg/kg per day) significantly delayed the onset of resistance (>91 days). In conclusion, development of a resistance-like phenotype to sorafenib is reversible, and metronomic UFT plus sorafenib may be a promising and well-tolerated treatment for increasing efficacy by delaying emergence of such resistance.",

Atrasentan has been developed as an oral selective endothelin-A receptor antagonist. The objective of the study was to investigate the feasibility and toxicity of adding increasing doses of atrasentan (to a maximum of 10 mg/d) and liposomal doxorubicin in patients with progressive ovarian cancer, refractory for platinum and paclitaxel. METHODS:Patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer were treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) 50 mg/m2 on day 1 (and repeated every 4 weeks) in combination with escalating doses of atrasentan once daily. The starting dose was 2.5 mg and escalated in cohorts of three patients from 5 to 10 mg. RESULTS:Twenty-six patients (mean age = 60 years, range = 42\u201374 years) were treated at the three dose levels. Atrasentan could be safely administered in combination at a dose of 10 mg. All patients were evaluable for toxicity, and 19 patients, included in the phase 2 period, were evaluable for response. Adverse events included nausea, vomiting, mucositis, skin toxicity, and rhinitis. Clinical cardiac toxicity, intensively monitored, was not observed, although two patients had a decrease in cardiac ejection fraction. Three objective responses were observed and another six patients had stable disease with a median time to progression of 14 weeks and an overall survival of 13.1 months. CONCLUSIONS:The addition of atrasentan to standard dose PLD in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer is feasible with some suggestion of prolonged survival.",

Our present study sought to determine whether oncogene BRAF and RAS mutations lead to increased HPR1 expression. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that HPR1 gene expression was increased in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a mutant BRAF or RAS gene. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that B-Raf activation led to loss of the cell surface HS, which could be blocked by two HPR1 inhibitors: heparin and PI-88. Cotransfection of a BRAF or RAS mutant gene with HPR1 promoter-driven luciferase reporters increased luciferase reporter gene expression in HEK293 cells. Knockdown of BRAF expression in a BRAF-mutated KAT-10 tumor cell line led to the suppression of HPR1 gene expression, subsequently leading to increased cell surface HS levels. Truncational and mutational analyses of the HPR1 promoter revealed that the Ets-relevant elements in the HPR1 promoter were critical for BRAF activation-induced HPR1 expression. Luciferase reporter gene expression driven by a four-copy GA binding protein (GABP) binding site was significantly lower in BRAF siRNA-transfected KAT-10 cells than in the control siRNA-transfected cells. We further showed that BRAF knockdown led to suppression of the expression of the GABP\u03b2, an Ets family transcription factor involved in regulating HPR1 promoter activity. Taken together, our study suggests that B-Raf kinase activation plays an important role in regulating HPR1 expression. Increased HPR1 expression may contribute to the aggressive behavior of BRAF-mutated cancer.",

We examined the effect of treatment of ATN-658 on human prostate cancer cell invasion, migration, proliferation, and regulation of intracellular signaling pathways. For in vivo studies, PC-3 cells (1 x 106) were inoculated into the right flank of male Balb C nu/nu mice through subcutaneous or through intratibial route (2 x 105) of male Fox Chase severe combined immunodeficient mice to monitor the effect on tumor growth and skeletal metastasis. Treatment with ATN-658 resulted in a significant dose-dependent decrease in PC-3 cell invasion and migration without affecting cell doubling time. Western blot analysis showed that ATN-658 treatment decreased the phosphorylation of serine/threonine protein kinase B (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) without affecting AKT, MAPK, and FAK total protein expression. In in vivo studies, ATN-658 caused a significant decrease in tumor volume and a marked reduction in skeletal lesions as determined by Faxitron x-ray and micro-computed tomography. Immunohistochemical analysis of subcutaneous and tibial tumors showed a marked decrease in the levels of expression of pAKT, pMAPK, and pFAK, consistent with the in vitro observations.

Little is known, however, about a role of CIN85 in EGFR signaling as well as its relevance to tumor development and progression of HNSCC. Here, we demonstrate that CIN85 is highly expressed in HNSCC tumor samples compared with adjacent normal tissues, and this overexpression is significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage. The experiments using CIN85-overexpressing and knockdown HNSCC cell lines showed that CIN85 promotes HNSCC growth and facilitates EGFR internalization without apparently affecting phosphorylation of EGFR. Moreover, CIN85 promoted TGF-\u03b1-induced activation of Ras and phosphorylation of downstream molecules such as c-Raf, MEK, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, leading to expression of c-Myc that is critical for sustained proliferation of HNSCC. Taken together, these findings suggest that CIN85 not only controls EGFR internalization but also promotes the EGFR-mediated tumor development and progression, and thus, CIN85 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of HNSCC.",

This study aimed to selectively damage the VEGFR-2-overexpressing vasculature of pancreatic cancer by SLT-VEGF fusion protein comprising VEGF and the A subunit of Shiga-like toxin which inhibits protein synthesis of cells with high VEGFR-2 expression. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors was evaluated in human pancreatic cancer cells (AsPC-1, HPAF-2) and in normal human endothelial cells (HUVEC) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Cells were treated with SLT-VEGF (0.1\u201310 nM), and cell viability, proliferation, and endothelial tube formation were assessed. Orthotopic pancreatic cancer (AsPC-1, HPAF-2) was induced in nude mice. Animals were treated with SLT-VEGF fusion protein alone or in combination with gemcitabine. Treatment began 3 days or 6 weeks after tumor induction. Primary tumor volume and dissemination were determined after 14 weeks. Microvessel density and expression of VEGF and VEGF receptors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: SLT-VEGF did not influence proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells; HUVECs (low-level VEGFR-2) reduced their proliferation rate and tube formation but not their viability. SLT-VEGF fusion protein reduced tumor growth and dissemination, increasing 14-week survival (AsPC-1, up to 75%; HPAF-2, up to 83%). Results of gemcitabine were comparable with SLT-VEGF monotherapy. Combination partly increased the therapeutic effects in comparison to the respective monotherapies. Microvessel density was reduced in all groups. Intratumoral VEGFR-2 expression was found in endothelial but not in tumor cells. CONCLUSIONS: SLT-VEGF is toxic for tumor vasculature rather than for normal endothelial or pancreatic cancer cells. SLT-VEGF treatment in combination with gemcitabine may provide a novel approach for pancreatic cancer.",

The aims of this study were to investigate the expression pattern of genes involved in gemcitabine sensitivity in resected PDAC tissues and to determine correlations of gene expression with treatment outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples from 70 patients with PDAC. Of the 70 patients, 40 received gemcitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy (AC). We measured hENT1, dCK, CDA, RRM1, and RRM2 messenger RNA (mRNA) levels by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and determined the combined score (GEM score), based on the expression levels of hENT1, dCK, RRM1, and RRM2, to investigate the association with survival time. By determining the expression levels of these genes in endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) cytologic specimens, we investigated the feasibility of individualized chemotherapy. RESULTS: High dCK (P = .0067), low RRM2 (P = .003), and high GEM score (P = .0003) groups had a significantly longer disease-free survival in the gemcitabine-treated group. A low GEM score (<2) was an independent predictive marker for poor outcome to gemcitabine-based AC as shown by multivariate analysis (P = .0081).

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) patients receive androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) to reduce tumor burden. However, complete eradication of PCa is unusual, and recurrent disease is evident within approximately 2 years in high-risk patients. Clinical evidence suggests that combining ADT with radiotherapy improves local control and disease-free survival in these patients compared with radiotherapy alone. We investigated whether vascularization of androgen-sensitive PCa xenografts changed after ADT and whether such therapy affected radiation response. CWR22 xenografts received combinations of ADT by castration (CWR22-cas) and 15 Gy of single-dose irradiation. At a shortest tumor diameter of 8 mm, vascularization was visualized by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging before radiation and 1 and 9 days after radiation. Voxel-wise quantitative modeling of contrast enhancement curves extracted the hemodynamic parameter Ktrans, reflecting a combination of permeability, density, and blood flow. Tumor volumes and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) were monitored during the experiment. The results showed that Ktrans of CWR22-cas tumors 36\u00b14 days after ADT was 47.1% higher than Ktrans of CWR22 tumors (P = .01). CWR22-cas tumors showed no significant changes in Ktrans after radiation, whereas Ktrans of CWR22 tumors at day 1 decreased compared with pretreatment values (P = .04) before a continuous increase from day 1 to day 9 followed (P = .01). Total PSA in blood correlated positively to tumor volume (r = 0.59, P < .01). In conclusion, androgen-exposed xenografts demonstrated radiation-induced reductions in vascularization and tumor volumes, whereas androgen-deprived xenografts showed increased vascularization and growth inhibition, but no significant additive effect of radiation.",

     "abstract": "Evidence indicates that diets enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) reduce the risk of prostate cancer, but biochemical mechanisms are unclear. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), a transmembrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan, supports the integrity of the epithelial compartment. In tumor cells of epithelial lineage, SDC-1 is generally downregulated. This may result in perturbation of homeostasis and lead to progression of malignancy. Our studies have shown that the n-3 PUFA species, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), increases SDC-1 expression in prostate tissues of Pten knockout (PtenP-/-) mice/cells and human prostate cancer cells. We have now determined that DHA-mediated up-regulation of SDC-1 induces apoptosis. Bovine serum albumin-bound DHA and exogenous human recombinant SDC-1 ecotodomain were delivered to PC3 and LNCaP cells in the presence or absence of SDC-1 small interfering (si)RNA. In the presence of control siRNA, both DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain induced apoptosis, whereas SDC-1 silencing blocked DHA-induced but not SDC-1 ectodomain-induced apoptosis. Downstream effectors of SDC-1 signaling linked to n-3 PUFA-induced apoptosis involved the 3\u03b2-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)/Akt/Bad integrating network. A diet enriched in n-3 PUFA decreased phosphorylation of PDK1, Akt (T308), and Bad in prostates of PtenP-/- mice. Similar results were observed in human prostate cancer cells in response to DHA and SDC-1 ectodomain. The effect of DHA on PDK1/Akt/Bad signaling was abrogated by SDC-1 siRNA. These findings define a mechanism by which SDC-1-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of PDK1/Akt/Bad mediates n-3 PUFA-induced apoptosis in prostate cancer.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor. Glioma progression depends on the rapid proliferation of tumor cells accompanied by an acute immunosuppressive environment, facilitated mainly by tumor infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs). In this study, we characterize the role of fibronectin, a high-molecular weight extracellular matrix glycoprotein secreted by tumor cells, in controlling glioma progression and in mediating immunosuppression. Fibronectin binds to membrane-spanning integrin receptors and plays an important role in cell signaling, in defining cellular shape, in mobility, and in regulating the cell cycle. We found that inhibition of fibronectin expression in glioma cells, using short hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of gene expression, delayed cell proliferation in vitro. This delayed growth is explained, in part, by the observed reduced expression of integrin \u03b21 fibronectin receptor, which was restored by the inhibition of proteosomal activity. In our analysis of the downstream signaling targets of integrin \u03b21, we demonstrated reduced phosphorylation of Src kinase and STAT-3. We also observed reduced survivin expression that induced a three-fold increased accumulation of fibronectin-knockdown cells in the G2/M phase. In an experimental animal model, the fibronectin knockdown tumors had a mean survival advantage of 23 days over wild-type tumors. Moreover, brain samples of animals bearing fibronectin-knockdown tumors showed delayed Treg recruitment. Collectively, we propose that fibronectin is a key mediator of glioma progression because its inhibition delays both tumor progression and immunosuppression.",

     "abstract": "The eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) is frequently overexpressed in human cancers and is associated with cellular transformation, tumorigenesis, and metastatic progression. It is known that Mnks can phosphorylate eIF4E. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) functions as a tumor suppressor, and it was previously suggested to regulate eIF4E phosphorylation. However, how PP2A regulates eIF4E phosphorylation has not been fully addressed. In this study, we have not only validated the role of PP2A in regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation but also demonstrated the mechanism underlying this process. Inhibition of PP2A using either okadaic acid or PP2A small interfering RNA (siRNA) increased eIF4E phosphorylation, which could be abolished by the presence of the Mnk inhibitor CGP57380 or deficiency of Mnk genes. Thus, Mnks are involved in PP2A-mediated regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation. Moreover, a dephosphorylation assay revealed that PP2A could directly dephosphorylate Mnk1 and eIF4E. m7GTP pull-down assay detected more eIF4G and phospho-eIF4E and less 4EBP-1 in PP2A siRNA-transfected cells than in control siRNA-transfected cells, indicating an increased cap binding of eIF4F complex. Accordingly, okadaic acid treatment or PP2A knockdown increased the levels of c-Myc and Mcl-1, which are proteins known to be regulated by a cap-dependent translation mechanism. Taken together, we conclude that PP2A negatively regulates eIF4E phosphorylation and eIF4F complex assembly through dephosphorylation of Mnk and eIF4E, thus suggesting a novel mechanism by which PP2A exerts its tumor-suppressive function.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is common in cancer. Increased expression of wild type and mutant EGFR is a widespread feature of diverse types of cancer. EGFR signaling in cancer has been the focus of intense investigation for decades primarily for two reasons. First, aberrant EGFR signaling is likely to play an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer, and therefore, the mechanisms of EGFR-mediated oncogenic signaling are of interest. Second, the EGFR signaling system is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. EGFR gene amplification and overexpression are a particularly striking feature of glioblastoma (GBM), observed in approximately 40% of tumors. GBM is the most common primary malignant tumor of the central nervous system in adults. In approximately 50% of tumors with EGFR amplification, a specific EGFR mutant (EGFRvIII, also known as EGFR type III, de2-7, \u0394EGFR) can be detected. This mutant is highly oncogenic and is generated from a deletion of exons 2 to 7 of the EGFR gene, which results in an in-frame deletion of 267 amino acids from the extracellular domain of the receptor. EGFRvIII is unable to bind ligand, and it signals constitutively. Although EGFRvIII has the same signaling domain as the wild type receptor, it seems to generate a distinct set of downstream signals that may contribute to an increased tumorigenicity. In this review, we discuss recent progress in key aspects of EGFR signaling in GBM, focusing on neuropathology, signal transduction, imaging of the EGFR, and the role of the EGFR in mediating resistance to radiation therapy in GBM.",

Although prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is an established biomarker in prostate cancer, it provides only limited information relating to bone metastases and the treatment of metastatic bone disease with bisphosphonates or novel noncytotoxic targeted or biological agents that may provide clinical benefits without affecting PSA levels. As bone metastases develop, factors derived from bone metabolism are released into blood and urine, including N- and C-terminal peptide fragments of type 1 collagen and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, which represent potentially useful biomarkers for monitoring metastatic bone disease. A number of clinical trials have investigated these bone biomarkers with respect to their diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive values. Results suggest that higher levels of bone biomarkers are associated with an increased risk of skeletal-related events and/or death. As a result of these findings, bone biomarkers are now being increasingly used as study end points, particularly in studies investigating novel agents with putative bone effects.

At 3 to 4 weeks after LoVo cell implantation, the animal was gavaged with either vandetanib (50 mg/kg) or vehicle twice (22 hours apart) and scanned with a preclinical DCE-CT scanner before (0 hour) and after treatment (24 hours). Quantitative maps of blood flow (BF) and volume (BV) of the tumor were calculated from the acquired DCE-CT images. The rats were divided into nonhypovascular, hypovascular, and combined (regardless of vascularity) groups. In the nonhypovascular group, significant decreases in both tumor BF and BV were observed in the vandetanib-treated rats compared with increases in the vehicle-treated rats. A significant decrease in BV was detected in the vandetanib-treated rats in the combined group as well. No differences in tumor growth, vascular endothelial growth factor expression, microvessel density, or apoptosis were observed between vandetanib- and vehicle-treated rats in all three groups. These results demonstrate that BF and BV imaging biomarkers from DCE-CT imaging can be used for rapid monitoring of immediate (24 hours after) antimicrovascular effects of vandetanib on tumors, even in the absence of significant changes of tumor volume or clinically relevant immunohistochemical end points.",

This study reports an opposite finding: we have found strong evidence that the MAPK pathway is inhibited in a subset of adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the salivary glands. ACC tumors consistently overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) c-Kit, which has been considered a therapeutic target. We performed mutational analysis of the c-Kit gene (KIT in 17 cases of ACC and found that 2 cases of ACC had distinct missense mutations in KIT at both the genomic DNA and messenger RNA levels. These mutations caused G664R and R796G amino acid substitutions in the kinase domains. Surprisingly, the mutations were functionally inactive in cultured cells. We observed a significant reduction of MAPK (ERK1/2) activity in tumor cells, as assessed by immunohistochemistry. We performed further mutational analysis of the downstream effectors in the c-Kit pathway in the genes HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN. This analysis revealed that two ACC tumors without KIT mutations had missense mutations in either KRAS or BRAF, causing S17N K-Ras and V590I B-Raf mutants, respectively. Our functional analysis showed that proteins with these mutations were also inactive in cultured cells. This is the first time that MAPK activity from the RTK signaling has been shown to be inhibited by gene mutations during tumor development. Because ACC seems to proliferate despite inactivation of the c-Kit signaling pathway, we suggest that selective inhibition of c-Kit is probably not a suitable treatment strategy for ACC.",

Aberrant activation of growth factor signaling is known to provide alternative proliferation pathways in breast cells that are fully transformed, but it is not known whether activation of growth factor signaling can substitute for estrogen signaling in causing aberrant proliferation in the normal breast epithelium. Here, we report that in a retrovirus-based somatic mouse model (replication-competent ALV-LTR splice acceptor/tumor virus A) that closely mimics the evolution of sporadic human breast cancers, mammary epithelial cells harboring PyMT or activated ErbB2 evolve into tumors independent of estrogen or other ovarian functions in contrast to previous observations of estrogen-dependent cancer formation in germ line mouse models of ErbB2 activation. Importantly, ErbB2 activation in normal mammary cells causes estrogen-independent proliferation in both estrogen receptor (ER)-negative cells as well as in normally quiescent ER-positive cells. Therefore, aberrant activation of growth factor signaling contributes to estrogen-independent proliferation of both preneoplastic and cancerous mammary cells, and prophylactic therapy against both growth factor signaling and estrogen signaling may need to be considered in women with increased risk of breast cancer.",

Treatment of GBM patients is multimodal with maximum surgical resection, followed by concurrent radiation and chemotherapy with the alkylating drug temozolomide (TMZ). The present study aims to identify genes implicated in the acquired resistance of two human GBM cells of astrocytic origin, T98G and U373, to TMZ. Resistance to TMZ was induced by culturing these cells in vitro for months with incremental TMZ concentrations up to 1 mM. Only partial resistance to TMZ has been achieved and was demonstrated in vivo in immunocompromised mice bearing orthotopic U373 and T98G xenografts. Our data show that long-term treatment of human astroglioma cells with TMZ induces increased expression of facilitative glucose transporter/solute carrier GLUT/SLC2A family members, mainly GLUT-3, and of the AKR1C family of proteins. The latter proteins are phase 1 drug-metabolizing enzymes involved in the maintenance of steroid homeostasis, prostaglandin metabolism, and metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. GLUT-3 has been previously suggested to exert roles in GBM neovascularization processes, and TMZ was found to exert antiangiogenic effects in experimental gliomas. AKR1C1 was previously shown to be associated with oncogenic potential, with proproliferative effects similar to AKR1C3 in the latter case. Both AKR1C1 and AKR1C2 proteins are involved in cancer pro-proliferative cell chemoresistance. Selective targeting of GLUT-3 in GBM and/or AKR1C proteins (by means of jasmonates, for example) could thus delay the acquisition of resistance to TMZ of astroglioma cells in the context of prolonged treatment with this drug.",

Our previous experimental chemotherapy studies have shown that treatment of human pancreatic carcinoma cells with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) alters the cellular transporter expression profile and that modulation of the expression of multidrug resistance protein 5 (MRP5; ABCC5) influences the chemoresistance of these tumor cells. Here, we studied the influence of acute and chronic gemcitabine treatment on the expression of relevant uptake and export transporters in pancreatic carcinoma cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), quantitative RT-PCR, and immunoblot analyses. The specific role of MRP5 in cellular gemcitabine sensitivity was studied by cytotoxicity assays using MRP5-overexpressing and MRP5-silenced cells. Exposure to gemcitabine (12 nM for 3 days) did not alter the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of MRP1, MRP3, MRP5, and equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (ENT1), whereas high dosages of the drug (20 \u00b5M for 1 hour) elicited up-regulation of these transporters in most cell lines studied. In cells with acquired gemcitabine resistance (up to 160 nM gemcitabine), the mRNA or protein expression of the gemcitabine transporters MRP5 and ENT1 was upregulated in several cell lines. Combined treatment with 5-FU and gemcitabine caused a 5- to 40-fold increase in MRP5 and ENT1 expressions. Cytotoxicity assays using either MRP5-overexpressing (HEK and PANC-1) or MRP5-silenced (PANC1/shMRP5) cells indicated that MRP5 contributes to gemcitabine resistance. Thus, our novel data not only on drug-induced alterations of transporter expression relevant for gemcitabine uptake and export but also on the link between gemcitabine sensitivity and MRP5 expression may lead to improved strategies of future chemotherapy regimens using gemcitabine in pancreatic carcinoma patients.",

In coculture experiments, astrocytes, but not fibroblasts, reduced apoptosis in human melanoma cells treated with various chemotherapeutic drugs. This chemoprotective effect was dependent on physical contact and gap junctional communication between astrocytes and tumor cells. Moreover, the protective effect of astrocytes resulted from their sequestering calcium from the cytoplasm of tumor cells.

More than 20 cytosolic proteins from murine splenocytes, RAW 264.7 cells, and the HECPP immortalized endothelial cells were photoaffinity-labeled. Although no protein domain, fold, or binding site for a specific ligand was found to be shared by all the candidate proteins, essentially all were noted to be oxidizable proteins, implicating a role for redox signaling in the action of DMXAA. Consistent with this hypothesis, DMXAA caused an increase in concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in RAW264.7 cells during the first 2 hours. This increase in ROS was suppressed in the presence of the antioxidant, N-acetyl-L-cysteine, which also suppressed DMXAA-induced cytokine production in the RAW 264.7 cells with no effects on cell viability. Short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of one of the photoaffinity-labeled proteins, superoxide dismutase 1, an ROS scavenger, resulted in an increase in tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 production by RAW 264.7 cells in response to DMXAA compared with negative or positive controls transfected with nontargeting or lamin A/C-targeting siRNA molecules, respectively.

More recently, researchers have proposed that the transforming ability of SRC is linked to its ability to activate key signaling molecules in these pathways, rather than through direct activity. It has been hypothesized that blocking SRC activation may inhibit these pathways, resulting in antitumor activity. However, successfully targeting SRC in a clinical setting remains a challenge, and SRC inhibitors have only recently begun to move through clinical development. Preclinical studies have identified specific molecular \u201csubgroups\u201d and histologies that may be more sensitive to SRC inhibition. In addition, other studies have demonstrated synergistic interactions between SRC inhibitors and other targeted therapies and cytotoxics. In this review, we summarize SRC biology and how it has been applied to the clinical development of SRC inhibitors. The status of SRC inhibitors, including dasatinib, saracatinib, and bosutinib, which are in phase 1, 2, and 3 trials, is highlighted.",

     "abstract": "Although the mechanisms through which hypoxia influences several phenotypic characteristics such as angiogenesis, selection for resistance to apoptosis, resistance to radiation and chemotherapy, and increased invasion and metastasis are well characterized, the relationship between tumor hypoxia and components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is relatively unexplored. The collagen I (Col1) fiber matrix of solid tumors is the major structural part of the ECM. Col1 fiber density can increase tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis, with cancer cell invasion occurringalong radially aligned Col1 fibers. Here we have investigated the influence of hypoxia on Col1 fiber density in solid breast and prostate tumor models. Second harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy was used to detect differences in Col1 fiber density and volume between hypoxic and normoxic tumor regions. Hypoxic regions were detected by fluorescence microscopy, using tumors derived from human breast and prostate cancer cell lines stably expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) under transcriptional control of the hypoxia response element. In-house fiber analysis software was used to quantitatively analyze Col1 fiber density and volume from the SHG microscopy images. Normoxic tumor regions exhibited a dense mesh of Col1 fibers. In contrast, fewer and structurally altered Col1 fibers were detected in hypoxic EGFP-expressing tumor regions. Microarray gene expression analyses identified increased expression of lysyl oxidase and reduced expression of some matrix metal loproteases in hypoxic compared with normoxic cancer cells. These results suggest that hypoxia mediates Col1 fiber restructuring in tumors, which may impact delivery of macromolecular agents as well as dissemination of cells.",

EPA-FFA induced apoptosis of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-positive human HCA-7 CRC cells in vitro. EPA-FFA in cell culture medium was incorporated rapidly into phospholipid membranes of HCA-7 human CRC cells and acted as a substrate for COX-2, leading to reduced synthesis of PGE2 and generation of PGE3. Alone, PGE3 bound and activated the PGE2 EP4 receptor but with reduced affinity and efficacy compared with its \u201cnatural\u201d ligand PGE2.

We hypothesized that assessing the gene expression of the chemotherapy response modifiers multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1) and excision repair crosscomplementing 1 (ERCC1) may help identify the group of patients benefiting from cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 108 patients with locally advanced bladder cancer, who had been enrolled in AUO-AB05/95, a phase 3trial randomizing a maximum of three courses of adjuvant cisplatin and methotrexate (CM) versus methotrexate, vinblastine, epirubicin, and cisplatin (M VEC), were included in the study. Tumor cells were retrieved by laser-captured microdissection and analyzed for MDR1 and ERCC1 expression using a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay. Gene expression levels were correlated with clinical outcomes by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: Expressions of MDR1 and ERCC1 were independently associated with overall progression-free survival (P = .001, relative risk = 2.9 and P = .01, relative risk = 2.24, respectively). The correlation of high MDR1 expression with inferior outcome was stronger in patients receiving M-VEC, whereas ERCC1 analysis performed equally in the CM and M-VEC groups. CONCLUSIONS: High MDR1 and ERCC1 gene expressions are associated with inferior outcome after cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced bladder cancer. Prospective studies are warranted to define a role for MDR1 and ERCC1 analysis in individualizing multimodality treatment in locally advanced bladder cancer.",

     "abstract": "PURPOSE: About 65% to 70% of melanomas harbor a mutation in v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) that causes the steady-state activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). We sought to investigate the efficacy of PLX4032 (BRAF inhibitor) to identify patterns/predictors of response/resistance and to study the effects of BRAF in melanoma. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Well-characterized melanoma cell lines, including several with acquired drug resistance, were exposed to PLX4032. Growth inhibition, phosphosignaling, cell cycle, apoptosis, and gene expression analyses were performed before and after exposure to drug. RESULTS: Using a growth-adjusted inhibitory concentration of 50% cutoff of 1 \u00b5M, 13 of 35 cell lines were sensitive to PLX4032, 16 resistant, and 6 intermediate (37%, 46%, and 17% respectively). PLX4032 caused growth inhibition, G0/G1 arrest, and restored apoptosis in the sensitive cell lines. A BRAF mutation predicted for but did not guarantee a response, whereas a neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog mutation or wild-type BRAF conferred resistance. Cells with concurrent BRAF mutations and melanocortin 1 receptor germ line variants and/or a more differentiated melanocyte genotype had a preferential response. Acquired PLX4032 resistance reestablishes ERK signaling, promotes a nonmelanocytic genotype, and is associated with an increase in the gene expression of certain metallothioneins and mediators of angiogenesis. CONCLUSIONS: PLX4032 has robust activity in BRAF mutated melanoma. The preclinical use of this molecule identifies criteria for its proper clinical application, describes patterns of and reasons for response/resistance, and affords insight into the role of a BRAF mutation in melanoma.",

     "abstract": "Although tamoxifen treatment is associated with improved survival in patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast tumors, resistance remains an important clinical obstacle. Signaling through growth factor signaling pathways, in particular through receptor tyrosine kinases, has been demonstrated to confer tamoxifen resistance in an estradiol-independent manner. The Ron receptor tyrosine kinase, a member of the c-Met family of receptors, is expressed in a number of human epithelial tumors, and elevated expression of Ron is associated with poor prognosis in women with breast cancer. In this report, we evaluated the role of Ron receptor activation in conferring resistance to tamoxifen in human and murine breast cancer cell lines. Activation of Ron by its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor-like protein (HGFL) was associated with partial rescue from tamoxifen-induced growth inhibition in Ron-expressing cell lines. Western analysis revealed that treatment of the T47D human breast cancer cell line with tamoxifen and HGFL was associated with increased phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1/2 and phosphorylation of serine residue 118 of ER. Expression of ER-dependent genes was increased in cells treated with tamoxifen and HGFL by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. All of these effects were inhibited by treatment with either a Ron-neutralizing antibody or a MEK1 inhibitor, suggesting the specificity of the effect to Ron, and the involvement of the MAPK 1/2 signaling pathway. In summary, these results illustrate a novel connection between the Ron receptor tyrosine kinase and an important mechanism of tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Previously, we identified the transcription factor CUX1 as an important modulator of invasion and resistance to apoptosis. Expression profiles suggested that CUX1 regulates a complex transcriptional program mediating tumor progression. We aimed to identify functionally relevant targets of CUX1 by using RNA interference (RNAi)-based loss-of-function screens. Therefore, we generated an RNAi library containing putative transcriptional targets of CUX1 identified by microarrays and performed cell viability screens. Using this approach, several CUX1 targets with effect on tumor cell viability were identified, including the glutamate receptor GRIA3, which was validated in detail for its effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and cell migration using RNAi knock-down and overexpression strategies in vitro, as well as xenograft models in vivo. The expression of GRIA3 was evaluated in human pancreatic cancer tissues. We found that knock-down of GRIA3 significantly reduced proliferation and migration and enhanced apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of GRIA3 significantly reduced apoptosis and enhanced both proliferation and tumor cell migration. GRIA3 could be confirmed as a downstream effector of CUX1 and was expressed in pancreatic cancer tissues. In vivo, GRIA3 significantly enhanced the growth of subcutaneous xenografts. Inhibitors of glutamate receptors such as GYKI52466 and SYM2206 significantly decreased survival of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting the presence of glutamate signaling in pancreatic cancer. In conclusion, GRIA3 plays a role as a mediator of tumor progression in pancreatic cancer downstream CUX1. To our knowledge, this is the first report to identify a glutamate receptor as a modulator of tumor progression in a solid cancer outside the brain.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with hematological malignancies or solid tumors, such as renal cell carcinoma or prostate cancer, display epigenetic aberrations (loss of synchronous replication of allelic counterparts) and genetic changes (aneuploidy) characteristic of the cancerous phenotype. This study sought to determine whether such alterations could differentiate breast cancer patients from cancer-free subjects. METHODS: The HER2 locus\u2014an oncogene assigned to chromosome 17 whose amplification is associated with breast cancer (BCA)\u2014and the pericentromeric satellite sequence of chromosome 17 (CEN17) were used for replication timing assessments. Aneuploidy was monitored by enumerating the copy numbers of chromosome 17. Replication timing and aneuploidy were detected cytogenetically using fluorescence in situ hybridization technology applied to phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes of 20 women with BCA and 10 control subjects. RESULTS: We showed that both the HER2 and CEN17 loci in the stimulated BCA lymphocytes altered their characteristic pattern of synchronous replication and exhibited asynchronicity. In addition, there was an increase in chromosome 17 aneuploidy. The frequency of cells displaying asynchronous replication in the patients\u2019 samples was significantly higher (P < 10\u221212 for HER2 and P < 10\u22126 for CEN17) than the corresponding values in the control samples. Similarly, aneuploidy in patients\u2019 cells was significantly higher (P < 10\u22129) than that in the controls. CONCLUSIONS: The HER2 and CEN17 aberrant replication differentiated clearly between BCA patients and control subjects. Thus, monitoring the replication of these genes offers potential blood markers for the detection and monitoring of breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Identification of the cell types capable of initiating and sustaining growth of the neoplastic clone in vivo is a fundamental problem in cancer research. It is likely that tumor growth can be sustained both by rare cancer stem-like cells and selected aggressive clones and that the nature of the mutations, the cell of origin, and its environment will contribute to tumor propagation. Genomic instability, suggested as a driving force in tumorigenesis, may be induced by genetic and epigenetic changes. The feature of self-renewal in stem cells is shared with tumor cells, and deviant function of the stem cell regulatory networks may, in complex ways, contribute to malignant transformation and the establishment of a cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Understanding the nature of the more quiescent cancer stem-like cells and their niches has the potential to develop novel cancer therapeutic protocols including pharmacological targeting of self-renewal pathways. Drugs that target cancer-related inflammation may have the potential to reeducate a tumor-promoting microenvironment. Because most epigenetic modifications may be reversible, DNA methylation and histone deacetylase inhibitors can be used to induce reexpression of genes that have been silenced epigenetically. Design of therapies that eliminate cancer stem-like cells without eliminating normal stem cells will be important. Further insight into the mechanisms by which pluripotency transcription factors (e.g., OCT4, SOX2, and Nanog), polycomb repressive complexes and microRNA balance selfrenewal and differentiation will be essential for our understanding of both embryonic differentiation and human carcinogenesis and for the development of new treatment strategies.",

Two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis experiments, together with topical applications of CMK, demonstrated that this PC inhibitor markedly reduced tumor incidence, tumor multiplicity, and metastasis, pointing to a significant delay in tumor progression in wild-type and PACE4 transgenic mice.

Understanding the mechanisms regulating cisplatin cytotoxicity may uncover strategies to enhance the efficacy of this important therapeutic agent. This study evaluates the role of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) as a mediator of cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. Cytotoxic doses of cisplatin and carboplatin treatments consistently induced ATF3 expression in five tumor-derived cell lines. Characterization of this induction revealed a p53, BRCA1, and integrated stress response-independent mechanism, all previously implicated in stress-mediated ATF3 induction. Analysis of mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway involvement in ATF3 induction by cisplatin revealed a MAPK-dependent mechanism. Cisplatin treatment combined with specific inhibitors to each MAPK pathway (c-Jun N-terminal kinase, extracellularsignal-regulated kinase, and p38) resulted in decreasedATF3 induction at the protein level. MAPK pathway inhibition led to decreased ATF3 messenger RNA expression and reduced cytotoxic effects of cisplatin as measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-ylF2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide cell viability assay. In A549 lung carcinoma cells, targeting ATF3 with specific small hairpin RNA also attenuated the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin. Similarly, ATF3-/murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were shown to be less sensitive to cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity compared with ATF3+/+ MEFs. This study identifies cisplatin as a MAPK pathway-dependent inducer of ATF3, whose expression influences cisplatin\u2019s cytotoxic effects.",

The transcription factor hypoxia-induciblefactor 1 (HIF-1)regulates several cellular processes, includingapoptosis, in response to hypoxia and to other stimuli also in normoxic conditions. Here we describe a novel protumor machinery triggered by TLR3 activation in PC3 cells consisting of increased expression of the specific 1.3 isoform of HIF-1\u03b1 and nuclear accumulation of HIF-1 complex in normoxia, resulting in reduced apoptosis and in secretion of functional vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Moreover, we report that, in the less aggressive LNCaP cells, TLR3 activation fails to induce nuclear accumulation of HIF-1\u03b1. However, the transfection of 1.3 isoform of hif-1\u03b1 in LNCaP cells allows poly(I:CI-induced HIF-1 activation, resulting in apoptosis protection and VEGF secretion. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that differences in the basal level of HIF-1\u03b1 expression in different prostate cancer cell lines underlie their differential response to TLR3 activation, suggesting a correlation between different stages of malignancy, hypoxic gene expression, and beneficial responsiveness to TLR agonists.",

However, long-term remissions are difficult to achieve, and myeloma cells often develop secondary resistance to proteasome inhibitors. We recently demonstrated that the extraordinary sensitivity of myeloma cells toward bortezomib is dependent on their extensive immunoglobulin synthesis, thereby triggering the terminal unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we investigated whether verapamil, an inhibitor of the multidrug resistance (MDR) gene product, can enhance the cytotoxicity of bortezomib. The combination of bortezomib and verapamil synergistically decreased the viability of myeloma cells by inducing cell death. Importantly, bortezomib-mediated activation of major UPR components was enhanced byverapamil. The combination of bortezomib and verapamil resulted in caspase activation followed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, whereas nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activity declined in myeloma cells. Also, we found reduced immunoglobulin G secretion along with increased amounts of ubiquitinylated proteins within insoluble fractions of myeloma cells when using the combination treatment. Verapamil markedly induced reactive oxygen species production and autophagiclike processes. Furthermore, verapamil decreased MDR1 expression. We conclude that verapamil increased the antimyeloma effect of bortezomib by enhancing ER stress signals along with NF-\u03baB inhibition, leading to cell death.

Whether auto-Ab may be useful to track metastatic progression or response to treatment is, however, largely unknown. To address these issues, the serological proteome was analyzed in an invasive but treatmentresponsive mouse tumor model. Among 40 serum-reactive proteins identified by multiplex analysis, we chose to focus on glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a chaperone protein involved in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response. We first validated GRP78 as a protein overexpressed and mislocalized in tumor cells. We then documented that an increase in GRP78 auto-Ab titer preceded the detection of a palpable tumor mass, correlated with metastatic progression, and was influenced by the onset of tumor neovascularization. We also found that chemotherapy and radiotherapy, both leading to inhibition of tumor growth, oppositely influenced the anti-GRP78 immune response. Whereas radiation increased the concentration of GRP78 auto-Ab by three-fold, the auto-Ab titer was reduced in response to bolus or metronomic administration of cyclophosphamide. Finally, we established a decrease in auto-Ab-producing B lymphocytes in response to chemotherapy and the overexpression of GRP78 together with a strong immunoglobulin response in irradiated tumors. In conclusion, we identified GRP78 auto-Ab as an early marker of tumor and metastatic progressions. However, the multiple influences of anticancer treatments on the humoral immune system calls for caution when exploiting such auto-Ab as markers of the tumor response.",

     "abstract": "Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and have demonstrated clinical utility in the treatment of patients with osteolytic bone metastases. They also exhibit direct antitumor activity in vitro and can reduce skeletal tumor burden and inhibit the formation of bone metastases in vivo. However, whether such effects are caused by a direct action of bisphosphonates on tumor cells or indirectly through inhibition of bone resorption remains unclear. To address this question, we used here a structural analog of the bisphosphorate risedronate, NE-58051, which has a bone mineral affinity similar to that of risedronate, but a 3000-fold lower bone antiresorptive activity. In vitro, risedronate and NE-58051 inhibited proliferation of breast cancer and melanoma cell lines. In vivo, risedronate and NE-58051 did not inhibit the growth of subcutaneous B02 breast tumor xenografts or the formation of B16F10 melanoma lung metastasis. In contrast to NE-58051, risedronate did inhibit B02 breast cancer bone metastasis formation by reducing both bone destruction and skeletal tumor burden, indicating that the antitumor effect of bisphosphonates is achieved mainly through inhibition of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.",

     "abstract": "We used a functional complementation approach to identify tumor-suppressor genes and putative therapeutic targets for ovarian cancer. Microcell-mediated transfer of chromosome 18 in the ovarian cancer cell line TOV21 G induced in vitro and in vivo neoplastic suppression. Gene expression microarray profiling in TOV21 +19 hybrids identified 14 candidate genes on chromosome 18 that were significantly overexpressed and therefore associated with neoplastic suppression. Further analysis of messenger RNA and protein expression for these genes in additional ovarian cancer cell lines indicated that EPB41L3 (erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1-like 3, alternative names DAL-1 and 4.1 B) was a candidate ovarian cancer-suppressor gene. Immunoblot analysis showed that EPB41L3 was activated in TOV21 +18 hybrids, expressed in normal ovarian epithelial cell lines, but was absent in 15 (78%) of 19 ovarian cancer cell lines. Using immunohistochemistry, 66% of 794 invasive ovarian tumors showed no EPB41L3 expression compared with only 24% of benign ovarian tumors and 0% of normal ovarian epithelial tissues. EPB41L3 was extersively methylated it ovarian cancer cell Hires and primary ovarian tumors compared with normal tissues (P = 00004), suggesting this may be the mechanism of gene inactivation it ovarian cancers. Constitutive reexpressior of EPB41L3 it a three-dimensional multicellular spheroid model of ovarian cancer caused significant growth suppressior and induced apoptosis. Transmission and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated many similarities between EPB41L3-expressing cells and chromosome 18 donor-recipient hybrids, suggesting that EPB41L3 is the gene responsible for reoplastic suppression after chromosome 18 transfer. Finally, ar irducible model of EPB41L3 expression it three-dimersioral spheroids confirmed that reexpression of EPB41L3 induces extensive apoptotic cell death it ovarian cancers.",

We correlated ERG protein expression with the presence of ERG gene rearrangements in prostate cancertissues using a combined immunohistochemistry(IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. We independently evaluated two patient cohorts and observed ERG expression confined to prostate cancer cells and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial reoplasia associated with ERG-positive cancer, as well as vessels and lymphocytes (where ERG has a known biologic role). Image analysis of 131 cases demonstrated nearly 100% sensitivity for detecting ERG rearrangement prostate cancer, with only 2 (1.5%) of 131 cases demonstrating strong ERG protein expression without any known ERG gene fusion. The combired pathology evaluation of 207 patient tumors for ERG protein expression had 95.7% sensitivity and 96.5% specificity for determining ERG rearrangement prostate cancer. Ir conclusion, this study qualifies a specific anti-ERG antibody and demonstrates exquisite association between ERG gene rearrangement and truncated ERG protein product expression.

The aim of the present study was to find evidence for this hypothesis by using a rat orthotopic bladder cancer model. Fisher rats were inoculated with AY-27 cells (a Fisher rat bladder cancer cell line). Cultured cancer cells, rat and human bladder cancer tissues, and publicly available microarray data from human bladder cancer were analyzed by means of bioinformatics and morphology. Results showed that 12 of 24 differentially expressed pathways were concordant in connection to cell cycle and proliferation between rats and humans (both non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive tumors) and that 11 of the 24 pathways, including major histocompatibility complex, were related to host immunosurveillance with activations of T cells and natural killer cells in rats. The altered pathways and morphogenesis of this rat model corresponded more closely with those of human muscle-invasive rather than non-muscle-invasive tumors. A unique ultrastructure displaying microvillus-formed niches was found in small areas within the tumor of both rats and humans. These niches were interconnected with desmosomes between cancer cells and without infiltration of lymphocytes. The expression of E-cadherin, selectins, PGP9.5, vascular endothelial growth factor, caspase-3, CD133, Oct-4, nestin, CD3, and CD45RA was lower in the tumor than in the adjacent normal epithelium. We suggest that the microvillus-formed niche that harbors a few implanted cancer cells might be the compartment that prevents the tumor eradication by the host immune system.",

Clinical studies have revealed that activating mutations in the KRAS protooncogene predict resistance to EGFR-targeted therapy. However, the causality between mutant KRAS and resistance to EGFR inhibition has so far not been demonstrated. Here, we show that deletion of the oncogenic KRAS allele from colorectal tumor cells resensitizes those cells to EGFR inhibitors. Resensitization was accompanied by an acquired dependency on the EGFR for maintaining basal extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Deletion of oncogenic KRAS not only resensitized tumor cells to EGFR inhibition but also promoted EGF-induced NRAS activation, ERK and AKT phosphorylation, and c-FOS transcription. The poor responsiveness of mutant KRAS tumor cells to EGFR inhibition and activation was accompanied by a reduced capacity of these cells to bind and internalize EGF and by a failure to retain EGFR at the plasma membrane. Of 16 human colorectal tumors with activating mutations in KRAS, 15 displayed loss of basolateral EGFR localization. Plasma membrane localization of the EGFR could be restored in vitro by suppressing receptor endocytosis through Rho kinase inhibition. This caused an EGFR-dependent increase in basal and EGF-stimulated ERK phosphorylation but failed to restore tumor cell sensitivity to EGFR inhibition. Our results demonstrate a causal role for oncogenic KRAS in desensitizing tumor cells not only to EGFR inhibitors but also to EGF itself.",

The dismal prognosis is due to postsurgery recurrences arising from escaped invasive tumor cells. The signaling pathways activated in invasive cells are under investigation, and models are currently designed in search for therapeutic targets. We developed here an in vivo model of human invasive GBM in mouse brain from a GBM cell line with moderate tumorigenicity that allowed simultaneous primary tumor growth and dispersal of tumor cells in the brain parenchyma. This strategy allowed for the first time the isolation and characterization of matched sets of tumor mass (Core) and invasive (Inv) cells. Both cell populations, but more markedly Inv cells, acquired stem cell markers, neurosphere renewal ability, and resistance to rapamycin-induced apoptosis relative to parental cells. The comparative phenotypic analysis between Inv and Core cells showed significantly increased tumorigenicity in vivo and increased invasion with decreased proliferation in vitro for Inv cells. Examination of a large array of signaling pathways revealed extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) down-modulation and Akt activation in Inv cells and an opposite profile in Core cells. Akt activation correlated with the increased tumorigenicity, stemness, and invasiveness, whereas Erk activation correlated with the proliferation of the cells. These results underscore complementary roles of the Erk and Akt pathways for GBM proliferation and dispersal and raise important implications for a concurrent inhibitory therapy.",

Leflunomide is prescribed to patients worldwide as an immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory disease-modifying prodrug. Leflunomide inhibited the growth of human prostate cancer xenographs in mice, and leflunomide or TFN promoted cytostasis and/or apoptosis in cultured cells. These findings suggest that TFN could be useful in prostate cancer chemoprevention. We investigated the possible mechanistic aspects of this tenet by characterizing the effects of TFN using premalignant PWR-1E and malignant DU-145 human prostate epithelial cells. TFN promoted a dose- and time-dependent cytostasis or apoptosis induction in these cells. The cytostatic effects of TFN, which were reversible but not by the presence of excess uridine in the culture medium, included diminished cellular uridine levels, an inhibition in oxygen consumption, a suppression of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, S-phase cell cycle arrest, and a conspicuous reduction in the size and number of the nucleoli in the nuclei of these cells. Conversely, TFN's apoptogenic effects were characteristic of catastrophic mitochondrial disruption (i.e., a dissipation of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, enhanced ROS production, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, and cytoplasmic vacuolization) and followed by DNA fragmentation. The respiration-deficient derivatives of the DU-145 cells, which are also uridine auxotrophs, were markedly resistant to the cytostatic and apoptotic effects of TFN, implicating de novo pyrimidine synthesis and mitochondrial bioenergetics as the primary targets for TFN in the respiration competent cells.

SCCRO's oncogenic function is substantiated by its ectopic expression, resulting in transformation of cells in culture and xenograft formation in nude mice. The aim of this study was to assess the in vivo oncogenicity of SCCRO in a murine model. Ubiquitous expression of SCCRO resulted in early embryonic lethality. Because SCCRO overexpression was detected in human gliomas, its in vivo oncogenic activity was assessed in an established murine glioma model. Conditional expression of SCCRO using a replication-competent ASLV long terminal repeat with splice acceptor/nestin-(tumor virus-A) tv-a model system was not sufficient to induce tumor formation in a wild-type genetic background, but tumors formed with increasing frequency and decreasing latency in facilitated background containing Ink4a deletion alone or in combination with PTEN loss. Ectopic expression of SCCRO in glial progenitor cells resulted in lower-grade gliomas in Ink4a-/- mice, whereas its expression in Ink4a-/-/PTEN-/- background produced high-grade glioblastoma-like lesions that were indistinguishable from human tumors. Expression of SCCRO with platelet-derived growth factor-beta (PDGF-\u03b2) resulted in an increased proportion of mice forming glioblastoma-like tumors compared with those induced by PDGF-\u03b2 alone. This work substantiates SCCRO's function as an oncogene by showing its ability to facilitate malignant transformation and carcinogenic progression in vivo and supports a role for SCCRO in the pathogenesis of gliomas and other human cancers.",

To assess the relevance of this mouse tumor suppressor to human lung cancer, the loss-of-Gprc5a signature was cross species compared with and integrated with publicly available gene expression data of human normal lung tissue and non-small cell lung cancers.

     "publication date": "05-2010",
     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Knowledge of factors and mechanisms contributing to the inherent radioresistance of pancreatic cancer may improve cancer treatment. Irradiation inhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) by phosphorylation at serine 9. In turn, release of cytosolic membrane \u03b2-catenin with subsequent nuclear translocation promotes survival. Both GSK3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin have been implicated in cancer cell proliferation and resistance to death. METHODS: We investigated pancreatic cancer cell survival after radiation in vitro and in vivo, with a particular focus on the role of the function of the GSK3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin axis. RESULTS: Lithium chloride, RNAi-medicated silencing of GSK3\u03b2, or the expression of a kinase dead mutant GSK3\u03b2 resulted in radioresistance of Panc1 and BxPC3 pancreatic cancer cells. Conversely, ectopic expression of a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2 resulted in radiosensitization of Panc1 cells. GSK3\u03b2 silencing increased radiation-induced \u03b2-catenin target gene expression asmeasured by studies of AXIN2 and LEF1 transcript levels. Western blot analysis of total and phosphorylated levels of GSK3\u03b2 and \u03b2-catenin showed that GSK3\u03b2 inhibition resulted in stabilization of \u03b2-catenin. Xenografts of both BxPC3 and Panc1 with targeted silencing of GSK3\u03b2 exhibited radioresistance in vivo. Silencing of \u03b2-catenin resulted in radiosensitization, whereas a nondegradable \u03b2-catenin construct induced radioresistance. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the hypothesis that GSK3\u03b2 modulates the cellular response to radiation in a \u03b2-catenin-dependent mechanism. Further understanding of this pathway may enhance the development of clinical trials combining drugs inhibiting \u03b2-catenin activation with radiation and chemotherapy in locally advanced pancreatic cancer.",

Molecules targeting nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) are expected to be of therapeutic value in those tumors where NF-\u03baB seems to play a unique survival role such as activated B-cell (ABC)-subtype DLBCL. We previously generated a rGel/BLyS fusion toxin for receptor-mediated delivery of the rGel toxin specifically to malignant B cells. In this study, we examined this fusion toxin for its ability to suppress DLBCL growth in vitro and in vivo. rGel/BLyS was specifically cytotoxic to DLBCL lines expressing all three BLyS receptors and constitutively active NF-\u03baB. Treatment with rGel/BLyS induced down-regulation of the phosphorylation of inhibitory subunit of NF-\u03baB (I\u03baB-\u03b1), inhibition of NF-\u03baB DNA-binding activity, and accumulation of I\u03baB-\u03b1. In agreement with these results, we additionally found that rGel/BLyS downregulated levels of several NF-\u03baB targets including Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, survivin, and x-chromosome linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis. Treatment also induced up-regulation of Bax and apoptosis through caspase-3 activation and poly ADP-ribose polymerase cleavage. Importantly, rGel/BLyS significantly inhibited tumor growth (P < .05) in a DLBCL xenograft model.

In this study, we explored the effect of combining alkylating agents and arsenic trioxide (ATO) on the suppression of tumor cells with inherited or acquired resistance to therapeutic agents. Our results showed that combining ATO and a synthetic derivative of 3a-aza-cyclopenta[a]indenes (BO-1012), a bifunctional alkylating agent causing DNA interstrand cross-links, was more effective in killing human cancer cell lines (H460, H1299, and PC3) than combining ATO and melphalan or thiotepa. We further demonstrated that the combination treatment of H460 cells with BO-1012 and ATO resulted in severe G2/M arrest and apoptosis. In a xenograft mouse model, the combination treatment with BO-1012 and ATO synergistically reduced tumor volumes in nude mice inoculated with H460 cells. Similarly, the combination of BO-1012 and ATO effectively reduced the growth of cisplatin-resistant NTUB1/P human bladder carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the repair of BO-1012-induced DNA interstrand cross-links was significantly inhibited by ATO, and consequently, \u03b3H2AX was remarkably increased and formed nuclear foci in H460 cells treated with this drug combination. In addition, Rad51 was activated by translocating and forming foci in nuclei on treatment with BO-1012, whereas its activation was significantly suppressed by ATO. We further revealed that ATO might mediate through the suppression of AKT activity to inactivate Rad51. Taken together, the present study reveals that a combination of bifunctional alkylating agents and ATO may be a rational strategy for treating cancers with inherited or acquired drug resistance.",

However, it is unclear if these factors are tumor-derived or actually represent the host defense. To analyze the concentrations of tumor- and microenvironmentderived factors associated with neoplastic growth, we used ELISA-based arrays specific for murine or human proteins to establish a profile of tumor- or host-derived factors circulating in the plasma or within the platelets upon human tumor implantation into mice. Many factors characterized as tumor-derived were actually secreted by host tissues. This study uncovered the origin of various cytokines and revealed their circulation methods. We found that tumor-produced cytokines are predominantly sequestered in platelets. Sequestered proteins are protected from degradation and, thus, may be functional at metastatic sites. These findings identify tumor-specific targets for the detection and prevention of tumor growth and metastasis.

In this 3D colonic crypt model, HKe3 cells showed the features of time course-dependent transit-amplifying and terminal-differentiated stages, which are characteristic of normal colonic crypt. On the basis of the features of HCT116 cells, activated KRAS inhibited normal cell polarity and apoptosis in 3D culture. The expression of DNA repair-related tumor suppressor genes including TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2, and EXO-1 was markedly suppressed by activated KRAS in 3D culture but not in 2D culture. These results together suggest that activated KRAS plays critical roles in the accumulation of genetic alterations through inhibition of DNA repair genes and apoptosis and that this 3D culture model will provide a useful tool for investigating the molecular mechanisms of CRC development.",

     "abstract": "Replicative senescence forms a major barrier to tumor progression. Cancer cells bypass this by using one of the two known telomere maintenance mechanisms: telomerase or the recombination-based alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism. The molecular details of ALT are currently poorly understood. We have previously shown that telomerase is actively repressed through complex networks of kinase, gene expression, and chromatin regulation. In this study, we aimed to gain further understanding of the role of kinases in the regulation of telomerase expression in ALT cells. Using a whole human kinome small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen, we highlighted 106 kinases whose expression is linked to human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter activity. Network modeling of transcriptional regulation implicated c-Myc as a key regulator of the 106 kinase hits. Given our previous observations of lower c-Myc activity in ALT cells, we further explored its potential to regulate telomerase expression in ALT. We found increased c-Myc binding at the hTERT promoter in telomerase-positive compared with ALT cells, although no expression differences in c-Myc, Mad, or Max were observed between ALT and telomerase-positive cells that could explain decreased c-Myc activity in ALT. Instead, we found increased expression of the c-Myc competitive inhibitor TCEAL7 in ALT cells and tumors and that alteration of TCEAL7 expression levels in ALT and telomerase-positive cells affects hTERT expression. Lower c-Myc activity in ALT may therefore be obtained through TCEAL7 regulation. Thus, TCEAL7 may present an interesting novel target for cancer therapy, which warrants further investigation.",

Using human CRC cell lines harboring mutant (SW480) versus wildtype (HCT116) APC gene and alteration in \u03b2-catenin pathway, herein we performed both in vitro and in vivo studies to examine for the first time whether silibinin targets \u03b2-catenin pathway in its efficacy against CRC. Silibinin treatment inhibited cell growth, induced cell death, and decreased nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of \u03b2-catenin in SW480 but not in HCT116 cells, suggesting its selective effect on the \u03b2-catenin pathway and associated biologic responses. Other studies, therefore, were performed only in SW480 cells where silibinin significantly decreased \u03b2-catenin-dependent T-cell factor-4 (TCF-4) transcriptional activity and protein expression of \u03b2-catenin target genes such as c-Myc and cyclin D1. Silibinin also decreased cyclin-dependent kinase 8 (CDK8), a CRC oncoprotein that positively regulates \u03b2-catenin activity, and cyclin C expression. In a SW480 tumor xenograft study, 100- and 200-mg/kg doses of silibinin feeding for 6 weeks inhibited tumor growth by 26% to 46% (P < .001). Analyses of xenografts showed that similar to cell culture findings, silibinin decreases proliferation and expression of \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1, c-Myc, and CDK8 but induces apoptosis in vivo. Together, these findings suggest that silibinin inhibits the growth of SW480 tumors carrying the mutant APC gene by down-regulating CDK8 and \u03b2-catenin signaling and, therefore, could be an effective agent against CRC.",

Previous studies have uncovered a potentially important role for CCL2 inflammatory chemokine signaling in regulating metastatic disease through a macrophage-dependent mechanism. In these studies, we demonstrate a significant regulatory mechanism for CCL2 expression in fibroblasts in mediating mammary tumor progression and characterize multiple functions for CCL2 in regulating stromal-epithelial interactions. Targeted ablation of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) type 2 receptor in fibroblasts (Tgfbr2FspKO) results in a high level of secretion of CCL2, and cografts of Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts with 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells enhanced tumor progression associated with recruitment of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Antibody neutralization of CCL2 in tumor-bearing mice inhibits primary tumor growth and liver metastases as evidenced by reduced cell proliferation, survival, and TAM recruitment. Both high and low stable expressions of small interfering RNA to CCL2 in Tgfbr2FspKO fibroblasts significantly reduce liver metastases without significantly affecting primary tumor growth, cell proliferation, or TAM recruitment. High but not low knockdown of CCL2 enhances tumor cell apoptosis. These data indicate that CCL2 enhances primary tumor growth, survival, and metastases in a dose-dependent manner, through TAM-dependent and -independent mechanisms, with important implications on the potential effects of targeting CCL2 chemokine signaling in the metastatic disease.",

     "abstract": "We have recently reported that elastin microfibril interface located protein 2 (EMILIN2), an extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoprotein, triggers cell death through a direct binding to death receptors. EMILIN2 thus influences cell viability through a mechanism that is unique for an ECM molecule. In the present work, we report an additional function for this molecule. First, we identify the region responsible for the proapoptotic effects, a 90-amino acid residue-long coiled-coil fragment toward the N-terminus of the molecule. The fragment recapitulates EMILIN2 proapoptotic mechanisms. In addition, using either the full molecule or the active fragment, for the first time, we demonstrate a significant antitumoral effect in vivo, likely due to a decrease in tumor cell viability. Unexpectedly, tumors treated with EMILIN2 or the deletion mutant display a significant increase of tumor angiogenesis. In view of this novel finding, the cotreatment of the growing tumors with an antiangiogenic drug led, in most cases, to a complete regression of tumor growth. These results grant further support to recent findings that pinpoint the microenvironment as an important regulator of cell fate under both physiological and pathological conditions and disclose the possibility of using EMILIN2 fragments as potent antineoplastic tools for cancer treatment.",

Loss of PTP\u03bc expression in GBMs is due to proteolytic cleavage that generates an intracellular and potentially a cleaved and released extracellular fragment of PTP\u03bc. Here, we identify that a cleaved extracellular fragment containing the domains required for PTP\u03bc-mediated adhesion remains associated with GBM tumor tissue. We hypothesized that detection of this fragment would make an excellent diagnostic tool for the localization of tumor tissue within the brain. To this end, we generated a series of fluorescently tagged peptide probes that bind the PTP\u03bc fragment. The peptide probes specifically recognize GBM cells in tissue sections of surgically resected human tumors. To test whether the peptide probes are able to detect GBM tumors in vivo, the PTP\u03bc peptide probes were tested in both mouse flank and intracranial xenograft human glioblastoma tumor model systems. The glial tumors were molecularly labeled with the PTP\u03bc peptide probes within minutes of tail vein injection using the Maestro FLEX In Vivo Imaging System. The label was stable for at least 3 hours. Together, these results indicate that peptide recognition of the PTP\u03bc extracellular fragment provides a novel molecular diagnostic tool for detection of human glioblastomas. Such a tool has clear translational applications and may lead to improved surgical resections and prognosis for patients with this devastating disease.",

     "abstract": "Most epithelial ovarian cancers are diagnosed postmenopausally, although the well-established epidemiological risk factors (parity, oral contraceptive use) are premenopausal. We hypothesized that accumulation of senescent fibroblasts, together with concomitant loss of presenescent fibroblasts within the ovarian cortex, promotes initiation and early development of ovarian cancer from ovarian surface epithelial (OSE) cells. To test this, we established immortalized OSE (IOSE) cell lines that mimic early neoplastic transformation by overexpressing the CMYC oncogene (IOSECMYC) and normal ovarian presenescent (PSN) and senescent (SEN) fibroblast cell lines. We then evaluated the ability of PSN and SEN fibroblasts to transform IOSE and IOSECMYC after coculture. SEN fibroblasts significantly enhanced neoplastic development of IOSECMYC cells; there was an up to 15-fold increase in migration of IOSECMYC cells cocultured with SEN fibroblasts compared with PSN fibroblasts. Conditioned medium from SEN fibroblasts promoted anchorage-independent growth of IOSECMYC cells. We studied fibroblast-epithelial cell interactions in heterotypic three-dimensional spheroid models. Dual immunohistochemical staining of spheroids for a proliferation marker (MIB-1) and cytokeratin-18 indicated that SEN fibroblasts induce approximately a five-fold increase in proliferation of IOSECMYC cells relative to cocultures with PSN fibroblasts. SEN, but not PSN fibroblasts, also induced nuclear atypia in epithelial cells in three-dimensional spheroids. These data suggest for the first time that the accumulation of senescent, or loss of presenescent fibroblasts, can promote neoplastic development of partially transformed OSE cells in vitro and illustrates the power of using three-dimensional heterotypic modeling to gain better insights into the etiology underlying the development of epithelial ovarian cancer.",

     "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lymphoid enhancer factor-1 (lef-1) is overexpressed in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) when compared with normal B cells and transcribes several genes implicated in the pathogenesis of CLL. We therefore hypothesize that antagonism of lef-1 might lead to killing of CLL cells. We used two small molecule inhibitors of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin/lef-1 signaling (CGP049090 and PKF115-584) to test our hypothesis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Enriched CLL cells and healthy B cells were used in this study. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of lef-1 in primary CLL cells was done using nucleofection, and 50% lethal concentration (LC50) of two small molecules was assessed using ATP-based cell viability assay. Apoptotic response was investigated in time course experiments with different apoptotic markers. Specificity of the small molecules was demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation experiments for the lef-1/\u03b2-catenin interaction. In vivo studies were done in JVM-3 subcutaneous xenograft model. RESULTS: Inhibition of lef-1 by siRNA leads to increased apoptosis of CLL cells and inhibited proliferation of JVM-3 cell lines. The two small molecule inhibitors (CGP049090 and PKF115-584) efficiently kill CLL cells (LC50<1 \u00b5M), whereas normal B cells were not significantly affected. Coimmunoprecipitation showed a selective disruption of \u03b2-catenin/lef-1 interaction. In vivo studies exhibited tumor inhibition of 69% with CGP049090 and 57% with PKF115-584 when compared with vehicle-treated controls, and the intervention was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that targeting lef-1 is a new and selective therapeutic approach in CLL. CGP049090 or PKF115-584 may be attractive compounds for CLL and other malignancies that deserve further (pre)clinical evaluation.",

     "abstract": "Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis but whether it has additional effects on the tumor microenvironment is largely unexplored. We show that overexpression of PEDF in orthotopic MatLyLu rat prostate tumors increased tumor macrophage recruitment. The fraction of macrophages expressing inducible nitric oxide synthase, a marker of cytotoxic M1 macrophages, was increased, suggesting that PEDF could enhance antitumor immunity. In addition, PEDF overexpression reduced vascular growth both in the tumor and in the surrounding normal tissue, slowed tumor growth, and decreased lymph node metastasis. Contrary, extratumoral lymphangiogenesis was increased. PEDF expression is, for reasons unknown, often decreased or lost during prostate tumor progression. When AT-1 rat prostate tumor cells, expressing high levels of PEDF messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein, were injected into the prostate, PEDF is markedly downregulated, suggesting that factors in the microenvironment suppressed its expression. One such factor could be macrophage-derived tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1). A fraction of the accumulating macrophages expressed TNF\u03b1, and TNF\u03b1 treatment downregulated the expression of PEDF protein and mRNA in prostate AT-1 tumor cells in vitro and in the rat ventral prostate in vivo. PEDF apparently has multiple effects in prostate tumors: it suppresses angiogenesis and metastasis, but it also causes macrophage accumulation. Accumulating macrophages may inhibit tumor growth, but they may also suppress PEDF and enhance lymph angiogenesis and, in this way, eventually enhance tumor growth.",

As expected, 4EGI-1 inhibited eIF4E/eIF4G interaction and reduced the levels of cyclin D1 and hypoxia-inducing factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), both of which are regulated by a cap-dependent translation mechanism. Moreover, 4EGI-1 induced CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein-dependent DR5 expression and ubiquitin/proteasome- mediated degradation of cellular FLICE-inhibitory protein (c-FLIP). Small interfering RNA-mediated blockade of DR5 induction or enforced expression of c-FLIP abrogated 4EGI-1's ability to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis, indicating that both DR5 induction and c-FLIP down-regulation contribute to enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis by 4EGI-1. However, inhibition of eIF4E/eIF4G interaction by knockdown of eIF4E effectively reduced the levels of cyclin D1 and HIF-1\u03b1 but failed to induce DR5 expression, downregulate c-FLIP levels, or augment TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

More importantly, inhibition of c-ABL resulted in sensitization to treatment by tamoxifen (TAM) in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, as manifested by inhibition of cell survival and suppression of anchorage-independent growth. We found that c-ABL interacts with estrogen receptor in breast cancer cells and that expression of c-ABL is a frequent event in primary breast cancer tumor tissues. In estrogen receptor-positive tumors, the expression of c-ABL significantly correlated with disease progression and metastasis. This study shows that c-ABL regulates the cellular response to TAM through functional interaction with the estrogen receptor, which suggests c-ABL as a therapeutic target and a prognostic tumor marker for breast cancer.",

We have demonstrated that activation of PPAR\u03b3 promotes epithelial differentiation of NSCLC by increasing expression of E-cadherin, as well as inhibiting expression of COX-2 and nuclear factor-\u03baB. The Snail family of transcription factors, which includes Snail (Snail1), Slug (Snail2), and ZEB1, is an important regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, as well as cell survival. The goal of this study was to determine whether the biological responses to rosiglitazone, a member of the thiazolidinedione family of PPAR\u03b3 activators, are mediated through the regulation of Snail family members. Our results indicate that, in two independent NSCLC cell lines, rosiglitazone specifically decreased expression of Snail, with no significant effect on either Slug or ZEB1. Suppression of Snail using short hairpin RNA silencing mimicked the effects of PPAR\u03b3 activation, in inhibiting anchorage-independent growth, promoting acinar formation in three-dimensional culture, and inhibiting invasiveness. This was associated with the increased expression of E-cadherin and decreased expression of COX-2 and matrix metaloproteinases. Conversely, overexpression of Snail blocked the biological responses to rosiglitazone, increasing anchorage-independent growth, invasiveness, and promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition. The suppression of Snail expression by rosiglitazone seemed to be independent of GSK-3 signaling but was rather mediated through suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity. These findings suggest that selective regulation of Snail may be critical in mediating the antitumorigenic effects of PPAR\u03b3 activators.",

     "abstract": "Using a Cre/loxP system, we have determined the phenotypic consequences attributable to in vivo deletion of both Rb1 and Trp53 in the mouse adrenal medulla. The coablation of these two tumor suppressor genes during embryogenesis did not disrupt adrenal gland development but resulted in the neoplastic transformation of the neural crest-derived adrenal medulla, yielding pheochromocytomas (PCCs) that developed with complete penetrance and were inevitably bilateral. Despite their typically benign status, these PCCs had profound ramifications on mouse vitality, with effected mice having a median survival of only 121 days. Evaluation of these PCCs by both immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy revealed that most Rb1-/-:Trp53-/- chromaffin cells possessed atypical chromagenic vesicles that did not seem capable of appropriately storing synthesized catecholamines. The structural remodeling of the heart in mice harboring Rb1-/-:Trp53-/- PCCs suggests that the mortality of these mice may be attributable to the inappropriate release of catecholamines from the mutated adrenal chromaffin cells. On the basis of the collective data from Rb1 and Trp53 knockout mouse models, it seems that the conversion of Rb1 loss-driven adrenal medulla hyperplasia to PCC can be greatly enhanced by the compound loss of Trp53, whereas the loss of Trp53 alone is generally ineffectual on adrenal chromaffin cell homeostasis. Consequently, the Trp53 tumor suppressor gene is an efficient genetic modifier of Rb1 loss in the development of PCC, and their compound loss in the adrenal medulla has a profound impact on both cellular homeostasis and animal vitality.",

In a panel of NSCLC cell lines, the ability of iloprost to inhibit transformed cell growth was not correlated with the expression of the cell surface receptor for prostacyclin, but instead was correlated with the presence of Frizzled 9 (Fzd 9) and the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3). Silencing of Fzd 9 blocked PPAR\u03b3 activation by iloprost, and expression of Fzd 9 in cells lacking the protein resulted in iloprost's activation of PPAR\u03b3 and inhibition of transformed growth. Interestingly, soluble Frizzled-related protein-1, a well-known inhibitor of Wnt/Fzd signaling, also blocked the effects of iloprost and Fzd 9. Moreover, mice treated with iloprost had reduced lung tumors and increased Fzd 9 expression. These studies define a novel paradigm, linking the eicosanoid pathway and Wnt signaling.

Therefore, we hypothesized a putative regulatory role of GPx4 during tumor progression and created transformed murine embryonic fibroblasts with inducible disruption of GPx4. GPx4 inactivation caused rapid cell death in vitro, which could be prevented either by lipophilic antioxidants or by 12/15-LOX-specific inhibitors, but not by inhibitors targeting other LOX isoforms or COX. Surprisingly, transformed GPx4+/- cells did not die when grown in Matrigel but gave rise to tumor spheroids. Subcutaneous implantation of tumor cells into mice resulted in knockout tumors that were indistinguishable in volume and mass in comparison to wild-type tumors. However, further analysis revealed a strong vascular phenotype. We observed an increase in microvessel density as well as a reduction in the number of large diameter vessels covered by smooth muscle cells. This phenotype could be linked to increased 12/15-LOX activity that was accompanied by an up-regulation of basic fibroblast growth factor and down-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor A protein expression. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of 12/15-LOX successfully reversed the tumor phenotype and led to \u201cnormalized\u201d vessel morphology. Thus, we conclude that GPx4, through controlling 12/15-LOX activity, is an important regulator of tumor angiogenesis as well as vessel maturation.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an intrinsically chemotherapy refractory malignancy. Development of effective therapeutic regimens would be facilitated by improved preclinical HCC models. Currently, most models consist of subcutaneous human tumor transplants in immunodeficient mice; however, these do not reproduce the extensive liver disease associated with HCC or metastasize. To address this deficiency, we developed an orthotopic model. Human HCC cells were transfected with the gene encoding secretable \u03b2-subunit human choriogonadotropin (\u03b2-hCG), which was used as a surrogate marker of tumor burden. The HCC cells were implanted into the left liver lobe of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, after which the efficacy of different therapies was evaluated on established, but liver-confined human Hep3B cell line HCC. Treatments included sorafenib or metronomic chemotherapy using cyclophosphamide (CTX), UFT, an oral 5-fluorouracil prodrug, or doxorubicin either alone or in various combinations, with or without an antiangiogenic agent, DC101, an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 antibody. Sorafenib inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner but caused severe weight loss in SCID mice, thus necessitating use of DC101 in subsequent experiments. Although less toxicity was observed using either single or doublet metronomic chemotherapy without any added antiangiogenic agent, none, provided survival benefit. In contrast, significantly improved overall survival was observed using various combinations of metronomic chemotherapy regimens such as UFT + CTX with DC101. In conclusion, using this model of liver-confined but advanced HCC suggests that the efficacy of a targeted antiangiogenic drug or metronomic chemotherapy can be mutually enhanced by concurrent combination treatment.",

     "abstract": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) comprises approximately 90% of ovarian cancers and arises from the surface epithelium. Typical treatment of EOC involves cytoreductive surgery combined with chemotherapy. More recent therapies have targeted the tumor vasculature using antiangiogenic compounds such as thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). TSP-1 mimetic peptides such as ABT-510 have been created and have been in various clinical trials. We have previously shown that ABT-510 reduces abnormal vasculature associated with tumor tissue and increases the presence of mature blood vessels. It has been hypothesized that treatment with antiangiogenic compounds would allow increased delivery of cytotoxic agents and enhance treatment. In this study, we evaluated the potential role of ABT-510 and various chemotherapeutics (cisplatin and paclitaxel) on tumor progression, angiogenesis, and the benefits of combinational treatments on tissue uptake and perfusion using an orthotopic syngeneic mouse model of EOC. Animals were treated with ABT-510 (100 mg/kg per day) alone or in combination with cisplatin (2 mg/kg per 3 days) or paclitaxel (10 mg/kg per 2 days) at 60 days after tumor induction. Radiolabeled and fluorescently labeled paclitaxel demonstrated a significant increase in tumor uptake after ABT-510 treatment. Combined treatment with ABT-510 and cisplatin or paclitaxel resulted in a significant increase in tumor cell and tumor endothelial cell apoptosis and a resultant decrease in ovarian tumor size. Combined treatment also regressed secondary lesions and eliminated the presence of abdominal ascites. The results from this study show that through vessel normalization, ABT-510 increases uptake of chemotherapy drugs and can induce regression of advanced ovarian cancer.",

     "abstract": "Ribosomal large subunit protein RPL41 is a basic (positively charged) peptide consisting of only 25 amino acids. An antisense-based functional screening revealed that the down-regulation of RPL41 led to an anchorage-independent growth of NIH3T3 cells in soft agar plates. RPL41 depletion with gene-specific small interfering RNA also resulted in malignant transformation of NIH3T3 cells including increased tumor growth in mice. RPL41 deletion was detected in 59% of tumor cell lines by fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses and RPL41 down-regulation in 75% of primary breast cancers by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. These studies suggest a tumor suppression role for RPL41. By mass spectrometry, RPL41 was associated with several cytoskeleton components including tubulin \u03b2, \u03b3, and myosin IIA, which was confirmed by Western blot analysis on both cellular lysis and individually in vitro-expressed proteins. RPL41 also bound directly to polymerized tubulins. Cells overexpressing a GFP-RPL41 were resistant to nocodazole-induced microtubule depolymerization. A synthetic RPL41 induced cellular \u03b1-tubulin acetylation and G2/M cell cycle arrest. These results indicate a stabilizing role of RPL41 on microtubule. Microtubule spindles are essential for chromosome segregation during mitosis. Cells with RPL41 knock-down showed abnormal spindles, frequent failure of cytokinesis, and formation of polynuclear cells. In interphase cells, RPL41-depleted cells had premature splitting of centrosome. Our results provide evidence that RPL41 is a microtubule-associated protein essential for functional spindles and for the integrity of centrosome and that the abnormal mitosis and disrupted centrosome associated with the RPL41 down-regulation may be related to malignant transformation.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) contributes to the development of HCC, whereas HBx with COOH-terminal deletion is a frequent event in the HCC tissues. Previously, we identified a natural mutant of HBx-truncated 27 amino acids at the COOH-terminal (termed HBx\u0394127), which strongly enhanced cell growth. In the present study, we focused on investigating the mechanism. Accordingly, fatty acid synthase (FAS) plays a crucial role in cancer cell survival and proliferation; thus, we examined the signaling pathways involving FAS. Our data showed that HBx\u0394127 strongly increased the transcriptional activities of FAS in human hepatoma HepG2 and H7402 cells. Moreover, we found that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) was responsible for the up-regulation of FAS by using MK886 (an inhibitor of 5-LOX) and 5-LOX small interfering RNA. We observed that HBx\u0394127 could upregulate 5-LOX through phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1/2 and thus resulted in the increase of released leukotriene B4 (LTB4, a metabolite of 5-LOX) by ELISA. The additional LTB4 could upregulate the expression of FAS in the cells as well. Interestingly, we found that FAS was able to upregulate the expression of 5-LOX in a feedback manner by using cerulenin (an inhibitor of FAS). Collectively, HBx\u0394127 promotes cell growth through a positive feedback loop involving 5-LOX and FAS, in which released LTB4 is involved in the up-regulation of FAS. Thus, our finding provides a new insight into the mechanism involving the promotion of cell growth mediated by HBx\u0394127.",

     "abstract": "Our recent studies have shown that annexin II, expressed on the cell surface of osteoblasts, plays an important role in the adhesion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to the endosteal niche. Similarly, prostate cancer (PCa) cells express the annexin II receptor and seem to use the stem cell niche for homing to the bone marrow. The role of the niche is thought to be the induction and sustenance of HSC dormancy. If metastatic PCa cells occupy a similar or the same ecological niche as HSCs, then it is likely that the initial role of the HSC niche will be to induce dormancy in metastatic cells. In this study, we demonstrate that the binding of PCa to annexin II induces the expression of the growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6) receptors AXL, Sky, and Mer, which, in the hematopoietic system, induce dormancy. In addition, GAS6 produced by osteoblasts prevents PCa proliferation and protects PCa from chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Our results suggest that the activation of GAS6 receptors on PCa in the bone marrow environment may play a critical role as a molecular switch, establishing metastatic tumor cell dormancy.",

     "abstract": "Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic cancer mainly because of widespread peritoneal dissemination and malignant ascites. Key to this is the capacity of tumor cells to escape suspension-induced apoptosis (anoikis), which also underlies their resistance to chemotherapy. Here, we used a nonadherent cell culture model to investigate the molecular mechanisms of apoptotic resistance of ovarian cancer cells that may mimic the chemoresistance found in solid tumors. We found that ovarian cancer cells acquired a remarkable resistance to anoikis and apoptosis induced by exposure to clinically relevant doses of two front-line chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and paclitaxel when grown in three-dimensional than monolayer cultures. Inhibition of the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor c-Met, which is frequently overexpressed in ovarian cancer, by a specific inhibitor or small interfering RNA blocked the acquired anoikis resistance and restored chemosensitivity in three-dimensional not in two-dimensional cultures. These effects were found to be dependent on both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signaling pathways. Inhibitors of PI3K/Akt abrogated ERK1/2 activation and its associated anoikis resistance in response to HGF, suggesting a signaling relay between these two pathways. Furthermore, we identified a central role of Ras as a mechanism of this cross talk. Interestingly, Ras did not lie upstream of PI3K/Akt, whereas PI3K/Akt signaling to ERK1/2 involved Ras. These findings shed new light on the apoptotic resistance mechanism of nonadherent ovarian cancer ascites cells and may have important clinical implications.",

Unlike EGF, Eaff did not activate the EGFR signaling pathway. Results showed that Eaff800 was bound and taken up specifically by EGFR-overexpressing A431 cells. When Eaff800 was intravenously injected into nude mice bearing A431 xenograft tumors, the tumor could be identified 1 hour after injection and it became most prominent after 1 day. Images of dissected tissue sections demonstrated that the accumulation of Eaff800 was highest in the liver, followed by the tumor and kidney. Moreover, in combination with a human EGFR type 2 (HER2)-specific probe Haff682, Eaff800 could be used to distinguish between EGFR- and HER2-overexpressing tumors. Interestingly, the organ distribution pattern and the clearance rate of Eaff800 were different from those of Haff682.

The transcription-independent pathway was demonstrated by the translocation of p53 to mitochondria. Our study showed that p53 mitochondrial translocation was found in mitomycin C (MMC)-treated HepG2. The p53 C-terminal domain is clustered with potential nuclear leading sequences and showed strong electrostatic ion-ion interactions with cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidic acid in vitro. Disruption of cardiolipin biosynthesis by phosphatidylglycero-phosphate synthase (PGS) or CDP-diacylglycerol synthase 2 (CDS-2) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) transfection eliminated the MMC-induced translocation of mitochondrial p53. The elimination of mitochondrial p53 translocation also reduced Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 mitochondrial distribution. In HEK 293T models with saturated p53 expression, the mitochondrial partition of p53, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 obviously decreased in their PGS shRNA- or CDS-2 shRNA-expressing stable clones. In p53-null H1299 models, both the mitochondrial partitions of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 were strongly reduced in relation to the HEK 293T models. The Bcl-xL mitochondrial partition was elevated in H1299 models expressing pCEP4-p53wt suggesting the direct carrier role of p53 in transporting Bcl-xL to the mitochondria. We also found that the cytosolic pool of Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 remained unaffected in the low-dose MMC treatment but decreased in the high-dose MMC treatment. The cytosolic pool of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL directly regulated their amounts in p53-dependent mitochondrial distribution. In the low-dose MMC treatment, the increased mitochondrial p53, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-2 could attenuate apoptosis. However, in the high-dose MMC treatment, only the p53 translocated to the mitochondria and resulted in apoptosis progression. On the basis of this study, we thought mitochondrial p53 might regulate apoptosis in a biphasic manner.",

The aim of this study was to elucidate whether whey acidic protein (WAP) genes on chromosome 20q13.12, a region frequently amplified in this cancer, are expressed in serous carcinoma, the most common form of the disease. Herein, we report that a trio of WAP genes (HE4, SLPI, and Elafin) is overexpressed and secreted by serous ovarian carcinomas. To our knowledge, this is the first report linking Elafin to ovarian cancer. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of primary tumors demonstrates genomic gains of the Elafin locus in a majority of cases. In addition, a combination of peptidomimetics, RNA interference, and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments shows that Elafin expression can be transcriptionally upregulated by inflammatory cytokines through activation of the nuclear factor \u03baB pathway. Importantly, using a clinically annotated tissue microarray composed of late-stage, high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas, we show that Elafin expression correlates with poor overall survival. These results, combined with our observation that Elafin is secreted by ovarian tumors and is minimally expressed in normal tissues, suggest that Elafin may serve as a determinant of poor survival in this disease.",

We found a direct correlation between \u03b14 integrin expression on B16-F1 melanoma cells and their ability to form adhesive interactions with monolayers of lymphatic endothelial cells. Adhesion of B16-F1 melanoma cells to lymphatic endothelial cells was mediated by the melanoma cell \u03b14 integrin binding to its counterreceptor, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), that was constitutively expressed on the lymphatic endothelial cells. VCAM-1 was also expressed on the tumor-associated lymphatic vessels of B16-F1 and B16\u03b14+ tumors growing in the subcutaneous space of C57BL/6J mice. B16-F1 tumors metastasized to lymph nodes in 30% of mice, whereas B16\u03b14+ tumors generated lymph node metastases in 80% of mice. B16-F1 melanoma cells that were deficient in \u03b14 integrins (B16\u03b14-) were nontumorigenic.

GBM patient samples were examined by three-dimensional fluorescent in situ hybridization of telomeres using two independent three-dimensional telomere-measurement tools (TeloView program [P1] and SpotScan system [P2]). These measurements identified three patients categories (categories 1\u20133), displaying significant differences in telomere numbers/nucleus (P1 = .0275; P2 \u2264 .0001), telomere length (P1 and P2 = .0275), and number of telomeric aggregates (P1 = .0464; P2 \u2264 .0001). These categories corresponded to patients with long-term, intermediate, and short-term survival, respectively (P = .0393). The time to progression analyses showed significant differences between the three categories (P = .0167). There was a correlation between time to progression, median survival, and nuclear telomere architecture. Our study suggests a link between patient outcome and three-dimensional nuclear-telomere organization and highlights the potential clinical power of telomere signatures as a new prognostic, predictive, and potentially pharmacodynamic biomarker in GBM.

The objective of our study was to determine BMP-7 expression in PCa metastases and investigate the effects of BMP-7 on PCa cells. Our results show that BMP-7 is expressed in metastatic PCa and its levels are increased in castration-resistant PCa versus androgen-dependent PCa, whereas the expression of BMP-7 is decreased in primary PCa versus normal prostate. Our in vitro results show that BMP-7 inhibits proliferation of androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells, stimulates androgen receptor signaling, increases the expression of differentiation-associated genes, and decreases the levels of some wingless-regulated transcripts. Interestingly, these effects were not detected in C4-2 castration-resistant PCa cells. In vivo expression of BMP-7 in castration-resistant C4-2 cells did not alter proliferation when these cells were grown subcutaneously, but their growth was inhibited in the bone environment. In summary, our results show that BMP-7 is expressed at the highest level in advanced castration-resistant PCa cells and that the inhibitory effects of BMP-7 are dependent on the differentiation status of PCa cells and the tumor microenvironment. Further studies are needed to identify changes in BMP-7 signaling that lead to the loss of its control of proliferation during PCa progression.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether blocking c-Met with an orally available c-Met inhibitor, PF-2341066, reduces tumor burden and increases survival in a xenograft model of ovarian cancer metastasis. Treatment of mice injected interperitoneally with SKOV3ip1 cells showed reduced overall tumor burden. Tumor weight and the number of metastases were reduced by 55% (P < .0005) and 62% (P < .0001), respectively. Treatment also increased median survival from 45 to 62 days (P = .0003). In vitro, PF-2341066 reduced HGF-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Met in the tyrosine kinase domain as well as phosphorylation of the downstream signaling effectors, Akt and Erk. It was apparent that inhibition of the pathways was functionally important because HGF-induced branching morphogenesis was also inhibited. In addition, proliferation and adhesion to various extracellular matrices were inhibited by treatment with PF-2341066, and the activity of matrix metalloproteinases was decreased in tumor tissue from treated mice compared with those receiving vehicle. Overall, these data indicate that PF-2341066 effectively reduces tumor burden in an in vivo model of ovarian cancer metastasis and may be a good therapeutic candidate in the treatment of patients with ovarian cancer.",

     "abstract": "Aneuploidy and chromosomal instability (CIN) are hallmarks of most solid tumors. These alterations may result from inaccurate chromosomal segregation during mitosis, which can occur through several mechanisms including defective telomere metabolism, centrosome amplification, dysfunctional centromeres, and/or defective spindle checkpoint control. In this work, we used an in vitro murine melanoma model that uses a cellular adhesion blockade as a transforming factor to characterize telomeric and centromeric alterations that accompany melanocyte transformation. To study the timing of the occurrence of telomere shortening in this transformation model, we analyzed the profile of telomere length by quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridization and found that telomere length significantly decreased as additional rounds of cell adhesion blockages were performed. Together with it, an increase in telomere-free ends and complex karyotypic aberrations were also found, which include Robertsonian fusions in 100% of metaphases of the metastatic melanoma cells. These findings are in agreement with the idea that telomere length abnormalities seem to be one of the earliest genetic alterations acquired in the multistep process of malignant transformation and that telomere abnormalities result in telomere aggregation, breakage-bridge-fusion cycles, and CIN. Another remarkable feature of this model is the abundance of centromeric instability manifested as centromere fragments and centromeric fusions. Taken together, our results illustrate for this melanoma model CIN with a structural signature of centromere breakage and telomeric loss.",

     "abstract": "Although medulloblastoma is the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor, its molecular underpinnings are largely unknown. We have identified rare, recurrent homozygous deletions of Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) in medulloblastoma using high-resolution single nucleotide polymorphism arrays, digital karyotyping, and genomic real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Furthermore, we show that there is loss of physiological KLF4 expression in more than 40% of primary medulloblastomas both at the RNA and protein levels. Medulloblastoma cell lines drastically increase the expression of KLF4 in response to the demethylating agent 5-azacytidine and demonstrate dense methylation of the promoter CpG island by bisulfite sequencing. Methylation-specific PCR targeting the KLF4 promoter demonstrates CpG methylation in approximately 16% of primary medulloblastomas. Reexpression of KLF4 in the D283 medulloblastoma cell line results in significant growth suppression both in vitro and in vivo. We conclude that KLF4 is inactivated by either genetic or epigenetic mechanisms in a large subset of medulloblastomas and that it likely functions as a tumor suppressor gene in the pathogenesis of medulloblastoma.",

     "abstract": "Cytokines in the bone marrow of multiple myeloma patients activate Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathways in tumor cells and promote tumor growth, survival, and drug resistance. INCB16562 was developed as a novel, selective, and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2 markedly selective over JAK3. The specific cellular activity of the inhibitor was demonstrated by its potent and dose-dependent inhibition of cytokine-dependent JAK/STAT signaling and cell proliferation in the absence of effects on Bcr-Abl-expressing cells. Treatment of myeloma cells with INCB16562 potently inhibited interleukin-6 (IL-6)-induced phosphorylation of STAT3. Moreover, the proliferation and survival of myeloma cells dependent on IL-6 for growth, as well as the IL-6-induced growth of primary bone marrow-derived plasma cells from a multiple myeloma patient, were inhibited by INCB16562. Induction of caspase activation and apoptosis was observed and attributed, at least in part, to the suppression of Mcl-1 expression. Importantly, INCB16562 abrogated the protective effects of recombinant cytokines or bone marrow stromal cells and sensitized myeloma cells to cell death by exposure to dexamethasone, melphalan, or bortezomib. Oral administration of INCB16562 antagonized the growth of myeloma xenografts in mice and enhanced the antitumor activity of relevant agents in combination studies. Taken together, these data suggest that INCB16562 is a potent JAK1/2 inhibitor and that mitigation of JAK/STAT signaling by targeting JAK1 and JAK2 will be beneficial in the treatment of myeloma patients, particularly in combination with other agents.",

     "abstract": "Constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is frequently detected in cancer, promoting its emergence as a promising target for cancer treatment. Inhibiting constitutive STAT3 signaling represents a potential therapeutic approach. We used structure-based design to develop a nonpeptide, cell-permeable, small molecule, termed as LLL12, which targets STAT3. LLL12 was found to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation (tyrosine 705) and induce apoptosis as indicated by the increases of cleaved caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase in various breast, pancreatic, and glioblastoma cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. LLL12 could also inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation induced by interleukin-6 in MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells. The inhibition of STAT3 by LLL12 was confirmed by the inhibition of STAT3 DNA binding activity and STAT3-dependent transcriptional luciferase activity. Downstream targets of STAT3, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and survivin were also downregulated by LLL12 at both protein and messenger RNA levels. LLL12 is a potent inhibitor of cell viability, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations values ranging between 0.16 and 3.09 \u00b5M, which are lower than the reported JAK2 inhibitor WP1066 and STAT3 inhibitor S3I-201 in six cancer cell lines expressing elevated levels of STAT3 phosphorylation. In addition, LLL12 inhibits colony formation and cell migration and works synergistically with doxorubicin and gemcitabine. Furthermore, LLL12 demonstrated a potent inhibitory activity on breast and glioblastoma tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. Our results indicate that LLL12 may be a potential therapeutic agent for human cancer cells expressing constitutive STAT3 signaling.",

     "abstract": "Ovarian carcinoma is the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers. Although transformation of the outer ovarian epithelium was linked with ovulation, the disease is significantly more prevalent and severe in postmenopausal women. We postulated that menopause could augment ovarian cancer progression through the effects of gonadotropins on multifocal seeding to the mesothelial layer lining the peritoneum. This seeding is mediated by integrins as well as by CD44 interaction with hyaluronan (HA). Here, we report the effect of gonadotropins on HA synthesis and degradation and on peritoneal adhesion. A significant concentration- and time-dependent induction in expression levels of HA synthases (HASs) and hyaluronidases (Hyals) was observed in vitro on stimulation of human epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells by gonadotropins. Hormonal regulation of HA-mediated adhesion was manifested in vivo as well, by fluorescence microscopy of stained MLS multicellular tumor spheroids. The number of spheroids adhered to the mesothelium of ovariectomized CD-1 nude mice 9.5 hours after intraperitoneal insertion was significantly higher than in nonovariectomized mice. Inhibition of HA synthesis by 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine (DON) both in spheroids and ovariectomized mice significantly reduced the number of adhered spheroids. Thus, the change in the hormonal environment during menopause assists in HA-dependent adherence of ovarian cancer spheroids onto the peritoneum. However, HA is antiangiogenic and it can significantly suppress tumor progression. Accordingly, angiogenesis of the adhered spheroids was significantly elevated in DON-treated tumors. These results can explain the selective pressure that can lead to simultaneously increased tumor expression of both HASs and Hyals.",

     "abstract": "Hypoxia is a common microenvironment in solid tumors and is correlated with tumor progression by regulating cancer cell survival. Recent studies suggest that activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum-related kinase (PERK) and phosphorylation of \u03b1 subunit of eIF2 (eIF2\u03b1) confer cell adaptation to hypoxic stress. However, eIF2\u03b1 is still phosphorylated at a lowered level in PERK knockout cells under hypoxic conditions. The mechanism for eIF2\u03b1 kinase(s) (eIF2AK)-increased cell survival is not clear. In this report, we provide evidence that another eIF2AK, the amino acid starvation-dependent general control of amino acid biosynthesis kinase (GCN2), is also involved in hypoxia-induced eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. We demonstrate that both GCN2 and PERK mediate the cell adaptation to hypoxic stress. High levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation lead to G1 arrest and protect cells from hypoxia-induced apoptosis. Reduced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 by knocking out either PERK or GCN2 suppresses hypoxia-induced G1 arrest and promotes apoptosis in accompany with activation of p53 signal cascade. However, totally abolishing phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 inhibits G1 arrest without promoting apoptosis. On the basis of our results, we propose that the levels of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation serve as a \u201cswitch\u201d in regulation of G1 arrest or apoptosis under hypoxic conditions.",

     "abstract": "Gliomas account for more than 50% of all primary brain tumors. The worst prognosis is associated with gliomas of astrocytic origin, whereas gliomas with an oligodendroglial origin offer higher sensitivity to chemotherapy, especially when oligodendroglioma cells display 1p19q deletions. Temozolomide (TMZ) provides therapeutic benefits and is commonly used with radiotherapy in highly malignant astrocytic tumors, including glioblastomas. The actual benefits of TMZ during long-term treatment in oligodendroglioma patients have not yet been clearly defined. In this study, we have investigated the effects of such a long-term TMZ treatment in the unique Hs683 oligodendroglioma model. We have observed increased TMZ sensitivity of Hs683 orthotopic tumors that were previously treated in vitro with months of progressive exposure to increasing TMZ concentrations before being xenografted into the brains of immunocompromised mice. Whole-genome and proteomic analyses have revealed that this increased TMZ sensitivity of Hs683 oligodendroglioma cells previously treated for long periods with TMZ can be explained, at least partly, by a TMZ-induced p38-dependant dormancy state, which in turn resulted in changes in amino acid metabolism balance, in growth delay, and in a decrease in Hs683 oligodendroglioma cell-invasive properties. Thus, long-term TMZ treatment seems beneficial in this Hs683 oligodendroglioma model, which revealed itself unable to develop resistance against TMZ.",

     "abstract": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors represent an emerging class of anticancer agents progressing through clinical trials. Although their primary target is thought to involve acetylation of core histones, several nonhistone substrates have been identified, including heat shock protein (HSP) 90, which may contribute towards their antitumor activity. Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a member of the HSP family of molecular chaperones and plays a central role in regulating the unfolded protein response (UPR). Emerging data suggest that GRP78 is critical in cellular adaptation and survival associated with oncogenesis and may serve as a cancer-specific therapeutic target. On the basis of shared homology with HSP family proteins, we sought to determine whether GRP78 could serve as a molecular target of the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat. Vorinostat treatment led to GRP78 acetylation, dissociation, and subsequent activation of its client protein double-stranded RNA-activated protein-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Investigations in a panel of cancer cell lines identified that UPR activation after vorinostat exposure is specific to certain lines. Mass spectrometry performed on immunoprecipitated GRP78 identified lysine-585 as a specific vorinostat-induced acetylation site of GRP78. Downstream activation of the UPR was confirmed, including eukaryotic initiating factor 2\u03b1 phosphorylation and increase in ATF4 and C/EBP homologous protein expression. To determine the biologic relevance of UPR activation after vorinostat, RNA interference of PERK was performed, demonstrating significantly decreased sensitivity to vorinostat-induced cytotoxicity. Collectively, these findings indicate that GRP78 is a biologic target of vorinostat, and activation of the UPR through PERK phosphorylation contributes toward its antitumor activity.",

Here, we take these data further and investigate the clinical relevance of circulating endothelial (progenitor) cells (CE(P)Cs) and modulatory cytokines in patients after chemotherapy with relation to progression-free and overall survival (PFS/OS). Patients treated with various chemotherapeutics were included. Blood sampling was performed at baseline, 4 hours, and 7 and 21 days after chemotherapy. The mononuclear cell fraction was analyzed for CE(P)C by FACS analysis. Plasma was analyzed for cytokines by ELISA or Luminex technique. CE(P)Cs were correlated with response and PFS/OS using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis. We measured CE(P)Cs and cytokines in 71 patients. Only patients treated with paclitaxel showed an immediate increase in endothelial progenitor cell 4 hours after start of treatment. These immediate changes did not correlate with response or survival. After 7 and 21 days of chemotherapy, a large and consistent increase in CE(P)C was found (P < .01), independent of the type of chemotherapy. Changes in CE(P)C levels at day 7 correlated with an increase in tumor volume after three cycles of chemotherapy and predicted PFS/OS, regardless of the tumor type or chemotherapy. These findings indicate that the late release of CE(P)C is a common phenomenon after chemotherapeutic treatment. The correlation with a clinical response and survival provides further support for the biologic relevance of these cells in patients' prognosis and stresses their possible use as a therapeutic target.",

Herein, we investigated GSE efficacy against intestinal tumorigenesis in APCmin/+ mice. Female APCmin/+ mice were fed control or 0.5% GSE (wt/wt) mixed AIN-76A diet for 6 weeks. At the end of the experiment, GSE feeding decreased the total number of intestinal polyps by 40%. The decrease in polyp formation in the small intestine was 42%, which was mostly in its middle (51%) and distal (49%) portions compared with the proximal one. GSE also decreased polyp growth where the number of polyps of 1 to 2 mm in size decreased by 42% and greater than 2 mm in size by 71%, without any significant change in polyps less than 1 mm in size. Immunohistochemical analyses of small intestinal tissue samples revealed a decrease (80%\u201386%) in cell proliferation and an increase (four- to eight-fold) in apoptosis. GSE feeding also showed decreased protein levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (56%\u201364%), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (58%\u201360%), and \u03b2-catenin (43%\u201359%) but an increased Cip1/p21-positive cells (1.9- to 2.6-fold). GSE also decreased cyclin D1 and c-Myc protein levels in small intestine. Together, these findings show the chemopreventive potential of GSE against intestinal polyp formation and growth in APCmin/+ mice, which was accompanied with reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis together with down-regulation in COX-2, iNOS, \u03b2-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-Myc expression, but increased Cip1/p21.
