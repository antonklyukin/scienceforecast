     "abstract": "Checkpoint inhibitor therapy is revolutionizing the management of the oncological disease. Despite the fact that gastric cancer is a common malignancy with a relatively poor prognosis, checkpoint inhibitor therapy has attracted relatively little attention for the treatment of this disease. We decided to perform a systematic review focusing on the potential usefulness of checkpoint inhibitors in patients with gastric cancer by reviewing all clinical trials involving checkpoint inhibitors in gastric cancer up to the 9th of September 2017.We systematically review all randomized controlled trials on the 9th September 2017. We searched the embase.com, Medline Ovid, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and databases of current ongoing randomized trials. A description assessment of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) was performed on Immune checkpoint inhibitors for PD1, CTLA4 and PD-L1 (Atezolizumab, Avelumab, Durvalumab, Ipilimumab, Nivolumab, Pembrolizumab, and Tremelimumab) in gastric cancer patients.The current body of biomedical literature describes 3621 gastric cancer patients being treated with checkpoint inhibitors and compared to patients receiving chemotherapy. PD-1 inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab in combination appear to substantially outperform conventional chemotherapy, with more extended overall survival median (OS; 10.0 vs. 6.0\u202fmo), a more significant objective response rate (36% versus 13%, p\u202f=\u202f0.10), with a reduced adverse event rate (33% vs. 22%), although other checkpoint inhibitors appear somewhat less effective.It seems that checkpoint inhibitor therapy in general, and PD-1-directed therapy, in particular, constitutes a rational therapeutic avenue for advanced gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a multifactorial disease with several physiologic and pathogenic mechanisms and pathways. In MS the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that provides insulation to the nerve cells in their brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. With the damaged and compromised nerve membrane, the nerve cells are not able to conduct electrical signals properly, resulting in limb numbness, paralysis, blindness and other neurological disorders. The main purpose of this paper is to highlight advancements in nanotechnology that has enabled the clinician to cross blood brain barrier and to target the brain and CNS of the patient with multiple sclerosis. We have focused on application of nanotechnology having therapeutic and imaging components to improve tissue imaging, targeted interactions at molecular level, nerve protection and regeneration therapy. We have also discussed the pathophysiology of the disease and nanotechnology based new strategies to deliver the therapeutic candidates for the diagnosis and treatment of MS. Future advances in the development of new practical treatment modalities for the treatment of MS is currently a potential area of research.",

Alteration in neutrophil secretions during pathological conditions result in altered neutrophil and monocyte functions. As hyperglucose and hyperisulin conditions are known to prime cells of innate immune system, the role of neutrophil secretion in activating or priming neutrophils and monocytes during these conditions was studied.Neutrophils were isolated and treated with hyperglucose, hyperinsulin or hyperglucose\u00a0+\u00a0hyperinsulin conditions in\u00a0vitro and the neutrophil supernatants were collected. Neutrophil and monocyte cells treated with these supernatants were then studied for their functions such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, NBT reduction and killing ability.Secretions of unstimulated neutrophils suppressed chemotaxis, phagocytosis and killing ability of monocytes but it did not affect the functions of neutrophils. Hyperinsulin and hyperglucose\u00a0+\u00a0hyperinsulin-induced neutrophil secretions caused reduction in phagocytic index of neutrophils without affecting other functions. Neutrophil secretions collected during hyperglucose or hyperinsulin did not alter monocyte functions significantly when compared to secretion collected from unstimulated neutrophils. In conclusion, the study reveals the role of neutrophil secretions in modulating neutrophil and monocyte functions in hyperglucose and hyperinsulin conditions.",

It is well established that human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of virtually 100% of these cancers, 70% of which are attributable to infections with HPV types 16 or 18. We developed a fusion protein comprising a cell penetrating and immunostimulatory peptide corresponding to residues 32 to 51 of the Limulus polyphemus protein (LALF32-51) linked to the HPV16 E7 antigen (LALF32-51\u2013E7) that is obtained from Escherichia coli. The development of new treatments as mentioned requires a robust and reproducible procedure for batch release. We used the combination of three batches of LALF32-51-E7 with Al(OH)3 in an experimental design to develop a biological activity test for batch release of this candidate, which uses prophylactic immunization in the TC-1 tumor mouse model. Two injections, spaced for 7 days with LALF31-52-E7+Al(OH)3 are sufficient for inducing a potent anti-tumor response in the TC-1 tumor model. LALF31-52-E7 vaccine candidates in combination with Al(OH)3, exhibited in C57BL/6 mice over 86% protection against tumor challenge and high titers of specific antibodies against LALF31-52-E7. The results obtained across three batches of LALF32-51\u2013E7+Al(OH)3 with this simple and uncomplicated assay based on prophylactic immunization in the TC-1 mouse model suggest that it would be feasible to implement it as a biological activity assay for the release of production batches of LALF32-51\u2013E7.",

However, the role of alternative system of medicine and other herbal remedies remains controversial in this regard.To study the effect of alternative system of medicine and other herbal remedies on the results of SPT.The patients having a strong history and clinical symptoms of allergic diseases like allergic rhinitis, bronchial asthma and chronic urticaria were subjected to skin prick testing.There were six patients whose SPT results were negative although history and clinical symptoms suggested otherwise. On probing the drug intake of the patients prior to the testing, it was observed that the patients had taken certain herbal medications which interfered with the allergy testing and gave false negatives.It is for the first time that a study has reported the significant effect of alternative medicine and other herbal supplements in suppression of skin prick test results. Therefore it is extremely important to ask properly the history of intake of alternative medicine and other dietary herbal ingredients and then insist on its abstinence for 10 days before SPT. A protocol wherein the allergist recommends to stop the use of any regional herbs prior to allergy testing will be the right step in improving the results of allergy testing and preventing false positives.",

In culture, EPCs generate Endothelial Colony Forming Cells (ECFCs) that have endothelial features but still retain properties of stem/progenitor cells. EPCs can be obtained either from cord blood (CB) or adult blood (AB). For clinical perspectives, both CB-ECFCs and AB-ECFCs have advantages and inconveniences. On one hand, CB-ECFCs are allogenic, with potential immune rejection, but are more clonogenic, proliferative and angiogenic than AB-ECFCs. We have found that these cells display high inter-individual variation in terms of clonogenic profile. Low clonogenic CB-ECFCs had functional properties similar to those of AB-ECFCs. Conversely, a high initial clonogenicity was associated to an enhanced proliferation, angiogenic potential and to an increased expression of genes linked to stem cell-ness. Selecting CB-ECFCs according the initial clonogenicity represent a relevant marker of their potential efficacy on vascular repair. On the other hand, AB-ECFCs are autologous, and should be immunologically well tolerated, but these cells give rise to only few colonies, proliferate less and are less angiogenic than CB-ECFCs. In order to go further in CB-/AB- characterization, we have analyzed the mechanisms of AB-ECFC premature senescence, and shown that GDF15 had pivotal role in this context.

     "abstract": "Increasing attention has been given to the tumor microenvironment (TME), which includes cellular and structural components such as fibroblasts, immune cells, vasculature, and extracellular matrix (ECM) that surround tumor sites. These components contribute to tumor growth and metastasis and are one reason why traditional chemotherapy often is insufficient to eradicate the tumor completely. Newer treatments that target aspects of the TME, such as antiangiogenic and immunostimulatory therapies, have seen limited clinical success despite promising preclinical results. This can be attributed to a number of reasons, including a lack of drug penetration deeper into the necrotic tumor core, nonspecific delivery, rapid clearance from serum, or toxic side effects at high doses. Nanoparticles offer a potential solution to all of these obstacles, and many recent studies have shown encouraging results using nanomedicine to target TME vasculature, ECM, and immune response. While few of these platforms have made it to clinical trials to date, these strategies are relatively new and may offer a way to improve the effects of anticancer therapies.",

     "abstract": "Many evidences supported the suggestion that one of the reasons for the failure of immunosuppressant like Corticosteroides, Calcinurine inhibitors and VitD3 in reestablishing skin immune tolerance is relying on inhibition of CCL22 expression from skin dendritic cells. Inhibition of CCL22 decreases CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells homing to macular area and reduces the suppression capacity of these cells that make a sort of an imbalance between effector and regulatory T cells. Addition of CCL22 into the skin lesion from external sources could change the ratio between effector and regulatory T cells which dramatically alter immune system and reestablish immune tolerance. This action can't be established by the later immunosuppressant (e.g. corticosteroids and calcinurine inhibitors) alone which give CCL22 an important role in the treatment of skin autoimmune and graft rejection diseases.",

Differential genes expression was evaluated in clinical trial, aimed at identifying a potential predictive marker for DC quality and, finally, for therapy responsiveness.DC used for immunotherapy revealed a clear difference of anti-HIV genes signature, so we classified DC into two groups (A-DC and B-DC). In A-DC a limited number of genes, including inflammasome-related genes (IL1B, IL18), were modulated during monocytes-to-DC differentiation. A larger subset of anti-HIV genes (restriction factors, co-factors, apoptotic factors) was modulated in B-DC. This more \u201cactivated/exhausted\u201d expression profile of B-DC apparently resulted from a more activated monocyte precursor.These results suggest that the actual selection of HIV+\u00a0individual for immunotherapy, based on clinical features, did not ensure the same DC product, and that less \u201cactivated/exhausted\u201d DC could positively affect the outcome of immunotherapy.",

MSCs have drawn much attention during the last decade in the field of regenerative medicine, mainly due to their capacity to differentiate into specific cell types, abundant production of soluble growth factors and cytokines, and hematopoiesis supporting properties. In addition, MSCs can migrate to the sites of inflammation and hold potent of immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects through cell and cell interactions between MSCs and lymphocytes or production of soluble factors. Therefore, the application of MSCs in many disease situations is full of possibilities for future clinical treatment. Phase III clinical trials have been run using MSCs for treatment of Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD), and MSCs product approval has been achieved for pediatric GVHD treatment in Canada and New Zealand (Prochymal\u00ae; Osiris Therapeutics). In addition, hundreds of clinical trials are being run using MSCs for treatment of several immune mediated diseases, including GVHD, aplastic anemia (AA), Crohn's disease (CD), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this review we mainly focus on immunomodulation potential of MSCs and promising therapeutic application of MSCs in immune mediated diseases. Furthermore, we emphasize that biological effectiveness of MSCs will be one of most important standards to determine the dose of MSCs infusion.",

Two authors independently extracted data for analysis using predefined selection criteria and quality indicators. Trials were also retrieved from the website of www.Clinicaltrials.gov.18 of the 225 articles identified met the inclusion criteria. However, there were only two studies that had control groups. Therefore, a brief qualitative analysis of the evidence was considered to be more adequate. It seems stem cells can reduce Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and help alleviate CD symptoms. Moreover, the incidence of serious adverse events caused by stem cell transplantation was very low (1.75%, 7/400).Stem cell therapy for CD is very promising, but large, multicenter and randomized clinical trials are needed to further support their therapeutic benefits.",

We designed a clinical trial for multiple myeloma (MM) treatment with CAR-modified T cells recognizing CD138 (CART-138). Five patients diagnosed with chemotherapy-refractory MM were enrolled into this trial, although one later advanced to plasma cell leukemia. By intravenous infusions, these patients received CD3+ CART-138 cells in an escalating dose. No intolerable toxicity was observed during this process. CART-138 cells were expanded to a level 1000 times higher than the initial engraftment level and were maintained in the peripheral blood. In addition, increased CART-138 cells were also detected in the bone marrow. Four of the five patients had stable disease (SD) longer than three months, and one patient with advanced plasma cell leukemia had a reduction of the myeloma cells in her peripheral blood (from 10.5% to <3%). This study suggests that the treatment of CART-138 is safe, feasible, and tolerable and has potential antitumor activity in\u00a0vivo, warranting further research in MM treatment using CART-138.",
