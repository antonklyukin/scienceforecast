     "abstract": "The skeleton is one of the most common sites of metastatic spread from advanced clear-cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC). Most of the bone lesions observed in RCC patients are classified as osteolytic, causing severe pain and morbidity due to pathological bone destruction. Nowadays, it is well known that cancer induced bone loss in lytic metastasis is caused by the triggering of a vicious cycle between cancer and bone resident cells that leads to an imbalance between bone formation and degradation. Targeting the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is an efficient treatment option for metastatic renal carcinoma patients. Moreover, bone targeted therapy could benefit bone metastatic cancer patients caused by advanced RCC. However, more data is needed to support the hypothesis of the beneficial effect of a combined therapy. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of targeting mTOR and the sequential combination with bone targeted therapy as a strategy to break the vicious cycle between ccRCC cells and osteoclasts. A previously optimized fully human co-culture model is used to mimic the crosstalk between Caki-2 cells (ccRCC) and osteoclasts. Cells are treated at fixed timing with everolimus, zoledronic acid and denosumab as single or sequential combined treatment. We show that Caki-2 cells can induce osteoclast cells differentiation from isolated human monocytes, as demonstrated by specific tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining and f-actin ring formation, in a statistically significant manner. Moreover, differentiated osteoclasts proved to be functionally active by pit formation assay. Caki-2 cells co-cultured with osteoclasts acquire a more aggressive phenotype based on gene expression analysis. Interestingly, the sequential combined treatment of everolimus and zoledronic acid is the most effective in the inhibition of both Caki-2 cells survival and osteoclastogenic potential, making it an effective strategy to inhibit the vicious cycle of bone metastasis. At preclinical level, this observation confirms the value of our co-culture model as a useful tool to mimic the bone microenvironment and to assess drug sensitivity in vitro. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in tumor-bone cells crosstalk will be investigated next.",

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most common primary sarcoma of the bone. Lung osteosarcoma metastases at diagnosis have a significantly poor prognosis, even when surgery plus chemotherapy are performed. Our goal was to analyze clinical and sarcoma characteristics that could help identify factors related to an increased rate of lung metastasis and to identify different modes of treatment and its correlation with survival.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was used to identify all osteosarcoma patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2015. Patient characteristics such as age, sex, ethnicity, marital status, tumor location, histologic grade, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, SEER cause-specific death classification, survival, and lung metastasis were collected. These factors were analyzed using Univariate and multivariate regression models in survival analyses.A total of 1057 osteosarcoma patients diagnosed from 2010 to 2015 were included, of which 176 were patients with lung metastasis. Substantial disparities in the rate of lung metastasis existed when osteosarcoma patients were stratified according to tumor location (P\u202f=\u202f0.0002) and tumor size (P <\u00a0.001). Using a Multivariate Cox regression model, being older than 30 years (vs. younger than 30, HR\u202f=\u202f2.171, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.623\u20132.905, P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001), having a tumor >5\u201310\u202fcm (vs. <5\u202fcm, HR\u202f=\u202f2.046, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.153\u20133.632, P\u202f=\u202f0.0014) and >10\u202fcm (vs. <5\u202fcm, HR\u202f=\u202f3.610, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f2.066\u20136.310, P <\u00a0.0001) were related to an increased HR for all-cause death. The HR decreased in patients with surgery (vs. no surgery, HR\u202f=\u202f0.189, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.138\u20130.260, P <\u00a00.0001) and osteosarcoma. As for osteosarcoma patients with lung metastases, Multivariate Cox regressions revealed that an increased HR was associated with being older than 30 years (vs. younger than 30 years, HR\u202f=\u202f2.142, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.273\u20133.605, P\u202f=\u202f.0041) and married (vs. no marriage, HR\u202f=\u202f2.418, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f1.400\u20134.176, P=\u202f.0015), while a decreased HR was related to having had surgery (vs. no surgery, HR\u202f=\u202f0.282, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.171\u20130.464, P <\u00a0.0001) and chemotherapy (vs. no chemotherapy, HR\u202f=\u202f0.107, 95% CI\u202f=\u202f0.050\u20130.229, P <\u00a0.0001).Advanced age (older than 30 years) and large tumors were related to a higher risk of lung metastases in osteosarcoma patients. Therefore, patients who were diagnosed at advanced age or had large tumors should receive comprehensive chest CT scans. Surgery and chemotherapy can significantly improve the survival of metastatic patients, while radiotherapy did not improve survival in these patients.",

Following data were evaluated: age, gender, side, radiological assessment, tumour location within the clavicle, and histopathological findings.Bone tumours were detected in 113 patients with a mean age of 40 years. The lateral third of the clavicle was most frequently involved. Analysis revealed 22 benign, 31 intermediate, and 60 malignant tumours. Eosinophilic granuloma was the most commonly found neoplasm (18.6%), followed by bone metastases (15.0%), Plasma cell myeloma (8.8%), Ewing sarcoma (8.8%), and Osteosarcoma (8.0%). 53% of the tumours were malignant. Mean age was 51 years in the malignant tumour group and 28 years in patients with a benign/intermediate lesion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).The high incidence of malignant bone tumours of the clavicle found in this study highlight the importance of biopsy to prevent delay in diagnosis and treatment of these lesions, especially in patients with increased age. We believe that the results of this study are of clinical importance and may aid the physician in the management of these rare lesions.",

     "abstract": "Advanced breast cancer has a high incidence of bone metastases. In bone, breast cancer cells induce osteolytic or mixed bone lesions by inducing an imbalance in bone formation and resorption. Activated fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) are important in regulation of tumor growth and bone remodeling. In this study we used FGFR1 and FGFR2 gene amplifications containing human MFM223 breast cancer cells in an experimental xenograft model of breast cancer bone growth using intratibial inoculation technique. This model mimics bone metastases in breast cancer patients. The effects of an FGFR inhibitor, dovitinib dilactic acid (TKI258) on tumor growth and tumor-induced bone changes were evaluated. Cancer-induced bone lesions were smaller in dovitinib-treated mice as evaluated by X-ray imaging. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography imaging showed higher total and cortical bone mineral content and cortical bone mineral density in dovitinib-treated mice, suggesting better preserved bone mass. CatWalk gait analysis indicated that dovitinib-treated mice experienced less cancer-induced bone pain in the tumor-bearing leg. A trend towards decreased tumor growth and metabolic activity was observed in dovitinib-treated mice quantified by positron emission tomography imaging with 2-[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose at the endpoint. We conclude that dovitinib treatment decreased tumor burden, cancer-induced changes in bone, and bone pain. The results suggest that targeting FGFRs could be beneficial in breast cancer patients with bone metastases.",

     "abstract": "Diverse aberrancy in genetic background, protein profiling, and biological pathways have emerged as important factors hindering discovery of effective treatment of osteosarcoma. In a previous study, we used a proteomic approach to identify some osteosarcoma-related proteins by analysis of protein profiling in individual patients through primary cell culture. Endoplasmic reticulum protein 29 (ERp29) emerged as a protein of interest for further study since accumulating evidence suggests it has broad functions in tumorigenesis of different types of cancer. Importantly, until now no report on examination of the expression patterns of ERp29 in osteosarcoma has been published.In this study, an expression of ERp29 was examined in patient-derived osteosarcoma cells (7 cases) and normal bone graft-derived osteoblasts (7 cases) using western blotting. Expression profile of ERp29 in 94 osteosarcoma cases was investigated using immunohistochemically stained on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded biopsied tissue. An association with clinicopathologic parameters and the patient survival was evaluated. The doubling time of five osteosarcoma cells lines expressing different levels of ERp29 was determined by a cell number along the exponential phase of the growth curve.The results substantiate the outcome from the proteomic study in which ERp29 expression was significantly higher in primary osteosarcoma cells compared to osteoblastic cells. Immunohistochemical analysis found that expression of ERp29 was low in 79% of the cases (immunoreactive score (IRS) <6). A significant correlation was observed between expression of ERp29 and patient survival. Lower expression of ERp29 (IRS<6) was statistically significantly associated with shorter overall survival of the patients (P\u202f=\u202f0.041). In addition, we found that osteosarcoma cells with low ERp29 expression had a higher growth rate compared with high-ERp29-expressing cells.These findings suggest a tumor suppressive role of ERp29 in osteosarcoma. In addition, ERp29 might potentially be applied as a prognostic indicator in patients with osteosarcoma.",

     "abstract": "Studies on the applications of bone transport using the Ilizarov method for osteosarcoma (OS) patients with surgical resection and neoadjuvant chemotherapy are rare.A retrospective analysis was conducted in 10 patients with limb OS receiving limb-salvage treatment by Ilizarov method from 2007 to 2012 in our hospital. The general information, treatment outcomes and follow-up data of the patients were collected.The mean length of the transported fragment and the mean transport distance of the affected limb were both 14\u202fcm. The mean time in the external fixator was 34.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f11.2 months (16\u201347 months) and the mean external fixation index (EFI) was 75\u202fdays/cm. The mean follow-up time was 68.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f26.6 months (37\u2013103 months). Seven patients underwent additional operations to treat the postoperative complications, and the mean number of operation was 1.7 times. Only one patient underwent amputation due to tumor relapse and all patients survived without tumor. The limb-salvage rate was 90%. At the time of external fixator removal, the ASAMI-bone\u00a0score\u00a0was good in 66.7% of patients and the ASAMI-function score was fair in 66.7% of cases. The mean MSTS score was 18.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f3.2 (n\u202f=\u202f9). At 10 months after fixator removal, both the ASAMI-bone\u00a0score and ASAMI-function score\u00a0were both excellent in 80% and good in 20% cases, and the mean MSTS score was further improved to 27.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.11 (n\u202f=\u202f5).Bone transport using the Ilizarov method can achieve good therapeutic effectiveness in the limb-salvage treatment for OS patients with neoadjuvant chemotherapy as long as the complications can be timely recognized and well managed.",

     "abstract": "Increasing evidences have demonstrated that Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are key regulatory RNAs that participate in multiple biological processes. LncRNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) is a newly identified lncRNA and functions as a regulator of growth in several cancers. However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of UCA1 in the metastasis of osteosarcoma remain unclear. In this study, we firstly found UCA1 is upregulated in both osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines, and increased UCA1 is associated with higher tumor stage, larger tumor size and poorer prognosis. Then for the first time, we demonstrated that UCA1 promotes the invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic investigation showed that UCA1 directly interactes with miR-582 and suppresses its expression. Moreover, UCA1 increases CREB1 expression by functioning as a ceRNA against miR-582, thus promoting the EMT process via CREB1-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and finally leading to osteosarcoma metastasis. These findings may extend the function of UCA1 in osteosarcoma progression and provide a promising therapeutic target for osteosarcoma treatment.",

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most common form of primary malignant bone tumor, with metastasis playing an essential role in determining a patient's prospects for survival. It is essential that new and better molecular targets that respond effectively to therapies and are predictive of the risk of tumor metastasis are identified. We have therefore undertaken the present prospective study to ascertain the clinical significance of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in osteosarcoma patients. Peripheral blood was obtained from patients both pre- and post-surgery then processed using a CanPatrol\u2122 system, an enrichment technique allowing isolation of CTCs by virtue of their size at baseline. Multiplex RNA in situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) was subsequently conducted to characterize the CTCs based on various molecular markers including MTA1, CD45, EpCAM, CK8, CK19, Vimentin and Twist. MTA1 expression was further validated by immunohistochemistry of the tumor tissue. Besides defining a diagnosis and prognosis for osteosarcoma patients, the correlation between CTC count and their molecular and clinicopathological characteristics was found to assist in the analysis of the response of patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our results revealed that the number of CTCs was significantly higher at baseline in metastatic patients than in those whose osteosarcomas were localized. The variation was attributed to the neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment. A cut-off value of 7 CTCs/5\u202fmL was found to effectively distinguish patients who had either a favorable or unfavorable prognosis. Notably, the ratio of mesenchymal CTCs at baseline was found to be higher in metastatic vs. localized osteosarcoma patients. In addition, the expression of MTA1 was higher in mesenchymal CTCs than the other CTC phenotypes. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a higher expression of MTA1 in tumor tissues from metastatic osteosarcoma patients. Taken together, our findings conclusively establish that the number and molecular phenotype of CTCs are predictive of tumor metastasis and the response of patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.",

The development of cellular strategies against specific characteristics of tumour cells appears to be promising, as they can target cancer cells selectively. Recently, Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) have been the subject of significant research in orthopaedic clinical practice through their use in regenerative medicine. Further research has been directed at the use of MSCs for more personalized bone sarcoma treatments, taking advantage of their wide range of potential biological functions, which can be augmented by using tissue engineering approaches to promote healing of large defects.

It is a highly aggressive tumor with a tendency to spread to the lungs, which are the most common site of metastasis. Advanced osteosarcoma patients with metastasis share a poor prognosis.

In addition, the 5-year survival of patients with a metastatic disease is around 20%, highlighting the need for novel therapeutic targets.Autophagy is an intracellular degradation process which eliminates and recycles damaged proteins and organelles to improve cell lifespan. In the context of cancer, numerous studies have demonstrated that autophagy is used by tumor cells to repress initial steps of carcinogenesis and/or support the survival and growth of established tumors. In osteosarcoma, autophagy appears to be deregulated and could also act both as a pro or anti-tumoral process.

Endocrine therapies like tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AI) are a standard therapeutic approach in hormone receptor positive breast cancers. Tamoxifen exerts ER-agonistic effects on bone, whereas AI negatively affect bone health by increasing resorption and fracture risk. The effect of endocrine therapies on circulating Sema4D levels in breast cancer patients has not been investigated yet.We measured circulating Sema4D plasma levels at primary diagnosis and in a follow-up sample 12 months after surgery in a cohort of 46 pre- and postmenopausal women with primary estrogen receptor positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant tamoxifen or AI.The mean baseline levels \u00b1 SD for Sema4D were 441.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f143.4\u202fpmol/l. No significant differences in total plasma Sema4D were observed when stratifying the patients according to age, menopausal status, tumor subtype, nodal and hormone receptor status, or tumor size. However, Sema4D levels were significantly reduced by 28% (p<0.001) in tamoxifen treated patients 12 months after surgery, whereas no alteration was observed in patients treated with AI.This finding potentially represents an additional mechanism of the bone-protective properties of tamoxifen and further emphasizes a link between Sema4D and estrogen receptor signaling.",

     "abstract": "Bone metastasis of cancer can be a result from systemic blood spreading or vertebral venous plexus spreading. Systemic blood pathway induced bone metastasis can happen in any bone in the body since the spreading is considered to be random. However, it remains unknown whether there is any pattern of vertebral venous plexus related bone metastasis. In this study, we explored bone metastasis patterns in patients whose primary tumors had been well identified.We included 290 consecutive cancer patients with bone metastases but no visceral metastases, out of 2559 patients whose bone metastases were diagnosed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography, between Jan 2015 and Oct 2017 at the Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. We excluded those with visceral metastasis to ensure that our study focused on metastasis through the vertebral venous plexus. And we analyzed the distribution and pattern of skeletal metastases.Of the 290 patients, 28 had head and neck tumors, 178 had thorax tumors, 49 had abdominal tumors and 35 had pelvic tumors; 102 (35%) had only one bone containing a metastasis and 188 (65%) had multiple bones containing metastases. Overall, metastases to the thoracic skeleton were more common in patients with thorax tumors than in other patients (81% vs. 67%, P\u202f=\u202f0.007); metastases to the cervical spine or thoracic bones were more common in patients with primary tumors above the diaphragm than those below the diaphragm (82% vs. 66%, P\u202f=\u202f0.002). Among those with only one bone containing a metastasis (n\u202f=\u202f102), patients with head and neck tumors had a higher incidence of cervical spine metastasis than other patients (25% vs. 2%, P\u202f=\u202f0.03), those with thorax tumors had a higher incidence of thoracic bone metastasis than other patients (56% vs. 35%, P\u202f=\u202f0.035), and those with pelvic tumors had a higher incidence of pelvis bone metastasis than other patients (78% vs. 27%, P\u202f=\u202f0.000054).In patients with only one bone containing a metastasis but no visceral metastasis, bones near the primary were more likely to be first metastasized. This may be a valuable clue to primary tumor sites in patients with cancers of unknown primaries.",

In this study, we aimed to explore the metabolome and identify targetable metabolic vulnerabilities in chondrosarcoma.A custom-designed metabolic compound screen containing 39 compounds targeting different metabolic pathways was performed in chondrosarcoma cell lines JJ012, SW1353 and CH2879. Based on the anti-proliferative activity, six compounds were selected for validation using real-time metabolic profiling. Two selected compounds (rapamycin and sapanisertib) were further explored for their effect on viability, apoptosis and metabolic dependency, in normoxia and hypoxia. In vivo efficacy of sapanisertib was tested in a chondrosarcoma orthotopic xenograft mouse model.Inhibitors of glutamine, glutathione, NAD synthesis and mTOR were effective in chondrosarcoma cells. Of the six compounds that were validated on the metabolic level, mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and sapanisertib showed the most consistent decrease in oxidative and glycolytic parameters. Chondrosarcoma cells were sensitive to mTORC1 inhibition using rapamycin. Inhibition of mTORC1 and mTORC2 using sapanisertib resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viability in all chondrosarcoma cell lines. In addition, induction of apoptosis was observed in CH2879 after 24\u202fh. Treatment of chondrosarcoma xenografts with sapanisertib slowed down tumor growth compared to control mice.mTOR inhibition leads to a reduction of oxidative and glycolytic metabolism and decreased proliferation in chondrosarcoma cell lines. Although further research is needed, these findings suggest that mTOR inhibition might be a potential therapeutic option for patients with chondrosarcoma.",

     "abstract": "We aimed to retrospectively assess the incidence of vertebral compression fractures (VCF), examine clinicopathologic factors potentially associated with VCF, and evaluate treatment response in patients who received stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for spine metastases (spMets).We identified 78 patients with 125 spMets at baseline and subsequent assessments. Patients received SBRT doses of 16 or 18\u00a0Gy. Patients with pre-existing VCF and co-existing local progression were excluded. Spine instability neoplastic score (SINS) was used for spMets categorization. Response to SBRT and VCF were assessed according to the Positron Emission tomography Response Criteria In Solid Tumors (PERCIST) and Genant scores, respectively. Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses were used to assess local control of disease and vertebral compression fracture-free survival (FFS).We treated 103 cases with single spMets and 11 cases involving double spMets with SBRT. Progressive disease was reported in 3.2% and 8.2% of the cases in the first and last PET/CT reports, respectively. The distribution of treatment response in the remaining patients was: complete response in 30.6% of patients, partial response in 47.1% of patients, and stable disease in 22.3% of patients in the first PET/CT; complete response in 62.3% of patients, partial response in 16.7% of patients, and stable disease in 21% of patients at the last monitoring. Local failures were observed in 15 (12%) of cases. Median SINS was 5 (range: 1\u221213); majority of patients in our cohort (70.4%) were categorized as stable according to SINS, five (4%) patients had Grade 3 VCF at a median time of 16 months after SBRT (range: 2\u221222 months), and 60% of VCF occurred after an interval of at least 12 months after SBRT. No bisphosphonate usage was significantly associated with VCF (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.204; p\u202f=\u202f0.022). Median FFS was 21 months. Univariate analyses indicated that female gender (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), bisphosphonate use (p\u202f=\u202f0.005), >6 months of bisphosphonates use (p\u202f=\u202f0.002), and the lowest vertebral body collapse score (p\u202f=\u202f0.023) were associated with higher FFS. Female gender (p\u202f=\u202f0.007), >6 months of bisphosphonates usage (p\u202f=\u202f0.018), and the lowest vertebral body collapse score (p\u202f=\u202f0.044) retained independent significance.This study demonstrated that spine SBRT with doses of 16\u201318\u00a0Gy promises good local control of disease with acceptable VCF rates. Lowest vertebral body collapse score, female gender, and >6 months of bisphosphonate use were significantly associated with longer FFS.",

Based on patient registration, the primary cohort was divided into a training set (n\u202f=\u202f479, data from 17 cancer registries) and a validation set (n\u202f=\u202f137, data from 1 cancer registry). Then, the prognostic effects of variables were analyzed using Kaplan\u2013Meier method and Cox proportional hazard model. Moreover, nomograms were established for estimating 3- and 5-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-special survival (CSS) based on Cox regression model. Last, nomogram was validated by training set and validation set.According to the multivariate analysis of training set, nomogram which combined age, race, stage, tumor site, tumor size and chemotherapy was identified. The internal bootstrap resampling approach suggested the nomogram had sufficient discriminatory power with the C-index of OS: 0.754 (95% CI, 0.705\u20130.802) and CSS: 0.759 (95% CI, 0.700\u20130.800). The calibration plots also demonstrated good consistence between the prediction and the observation.Our nomogram is a reliable and powerful tool for distinguishing and predicting the survival of ES patients, thus helping to better select medical examinations and optimize treatment options in collaboration with medical oncologists and surgeons.",

     "abstract": "Operative fixation for femoral metastatic bone disease is based on the principles of reducing pain and restoring function. Recent literature has proposed a number of prognostic models for appendicular metastatic bone disease. The aim of this study was to compare the accuracy of proposed soring systems in the setting of femoral metastatic bone disease in order to provide surgeons with information to determine the most appropriate scoring system in this setting.A retrospective cohort analysis of patients who underwent surgical management of femoral metastatic bone disease at a single institution were included. A pre-operative predicted survival for all 114 patients was retrospectively calculated utilising the revised Katagiri model, PathFx model, SSG score, Janssen nomogram, OPTModel and SPRING 13 nomogram. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression proportional hazard models were constructed to assess the role of prognostic variables in the patient group. Area under the receiver characteristics and Brier scores were calculated for each prognostic model from comparison of predicted survival and actual survival of patients to quantify the accuracy of each model.For the femoral metastatic bone disease patients treated with surgical fixation, multivariate analysis demonstrated a number of pre-operative factors associated with survival in femoral metastatic bone disease, consistent with established literature. The OPTIModel demonstrated the highest accuracy at predicting 12-month (Area Under the Curve [AUC]\u202f=\u202f0.79) and 24-month (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.77) survival after surgical management. PathFx model was the most accurate at predicting 3-month survival (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.70) and 6-month (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.70) survival. The PathFx model was successfully externally validated in the femoral patient dataset for all time periods.Among six prognostic models assessed in the setting of femoral metastatic bone disease, the present study observed the most accurate model for 3-month, 6-month, 12-month and 24-month survival. The results of this study may be utilised by the treating surgical team to determine the most accurate model for the required time period and therefore improve decision-making in the care of patients with femoral metastatic bone disease.",

Despite the recent therapeutic advances, patients with BM may still experience skeletal-related events and symptomatic skeletal events, with detrimental impact on quality of life and survival.A deeper knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the onset of lytic and sclerotic BM has been acquired in the last decades, leading to the development of bone-targeting agents (BTA), mainly represented by anti-resorptive drugs and bone-seeking radiopharmaceuticals. Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have showed promising effects of novel agents, whose safety and efficacy need to be confirmed by prospective clinical trials.Among BTA, adjuvant bisphosphonates have also been shown to reduce the risk of BM in selected breast cancer patients, but failed to reduce the incidence of BM from lung and prostate cancer. Moreover, adjuvant denosumab did not improve BM free survival in patients with breast cancer, suggesting the need for further investigation to clarify BTA role in early-stage malignancies.The aim of this review is to describe BM pathogenesis and current treatment options in different clinical settings, as well as to explore the mechanism of action of novel potential therapeutic agents for which further investigation is needed.",

In this prespecified exploratory analysis, changes in biomarkers of bone turnover were assessed in patients from baseline to weeks 4, 12, and 24. The serum bone markers assessed were procollagen type 1\u00a0N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen (CTX), osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-vitamin D). On-treatment changes in bone markers over time were described per subgroup of interest and efficacy outcomes.Bone marker data were available for 241 of 299 enrolled patients. At the final assessment, P1NP, osteocalcin, PTH, 25-OH-vitamin D (all P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and CTX (P\u202f=\u202f0.036) were significantly decreased from baseline values per the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. At the last assessment (24 weeks or earlier), levels of serum CTX and PTH were significantly lower (P\u202f=\u202f0.009 and P\u202f=\u202f0.034, respectively) among patients with vs. without prior antiresorptive treatment (ART). Serum CTX levels were significantly lower (P\u202f<\u202f0.001), and 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations significantly higher (P\u202f=\u202f0.029), at the last postbaseline assessment in patients receiving concomitant ART vs. those without ART. Changes from baseline in PTH and 25-OH-vitamin D concentrations to the final assessment were significantly smaller in patients with prior ART. Lower baseline serum concentrations of osteocalcin and PTH were associated with clinical response (partial vs. non-response) at 24 weeks.

SCS is mostly a high-grade malignancy (92%) with a male to female ratio of 1.6 for all patients. The axial to appendicular ratio was 0.7, seemingly independent of age. More than one fourth of the patients (29%) had primary metastatic disease. Another 32 patients (46%) developed metastases during follow-up and 12 (17%) experienced local relapses. The five-year sarcoma-specific survival rate was 37%, with no documented improvement over time. Primary metastatic disease was an adverse prognostic factor for survival. Predisposing factors were documented in 19 patients (18%). Negative prognostic factors for overall survival were tumour size >9\u00a0cm, age\u00a0>\u00a040 years, axial tumour localization, FS as subtype and pathologic fracture at time of diagnoses. As expected, patients who received both surgery and chemotherapy as their primary treatment for high-grade SCS (25%) significantly had best sarcoma specific five years survival (62%).We confirm SCS as a rare high-grade bone sarcoma entity, mostly among elderly patients and with a poor overall outcome. The combined treatment of surgery and chemotherapy is essential to achieve optimal long-term survival of SCS.",

     "abstract": "Through its receptor (VDR), vitamin D3 plays an important role in a wide variety of cellular processes. Polymorphisms in VDR gene have been linked to risk of various cancers and their prognoses. We conducted a case-control study to analyze he relationship of VDR gene polymorphisms with the occurrence and prognosis of osteosarcoma.Fifty-eight osteosarcoma patients and 75 healthy controls were included in the study. Single nucleotide change polymorphisms (SNPs) in Cdx2, FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI regions of VDR gene were examined with SNaPshot mini-sequencing technique. Allele and genotype frequencies in patients and controls were compared. The association of polymorphic genotypes with osteosarcoma was evaluated. The relationship of the presence of polymorphism to prognostic parameters and survival rates were also analyzed.Allele and genotype frequencies of Cdx2, FokI, BsmI, ApaI and TaqI regions in VDR gene were found to be similar in patients and controls. Polymorphisms in these regions were not associated with osteosarcoma risk. In patients having Cdx2 polymorphic allele, tumor volume was greater (p:0.041), metastasis was more common (p:0.042) and histopathological response to chemotherapy was worse (p:0.044). Good histopathological response was significantly higher in patients with BsmI homozygous polymorphism (p:0.037). In the presence of heterozygous Cdx2 and homozygous a higher three-year overall survival rate was found, while there was a higher event-free survival rate in patients with ApaI polymorphisms.Our results suggested that although polymorphisms of VDR gene are not related to the development of osteosarcoma, they may be important for prognosis. Understanding the effect of VDR polymorphisms on osteosarcoma will be important in identifying new prognostic parameters and new targets for treatment.",

However, reconstruction methods for large bone defect after wide tumor resection in this location are debatable. The purpose of this systematical review is to critically evaluate each reconstruction method regarding the postoperative complications and functional outcome.A systematic review of the 33 studies including 337 cases with tumors affecting distal tibia was performed after searching the PubMed and EMBASE databases. Pooled descriptive statistics with separate analyses for postoperative complications and functional outcome of different reconstruction options were performed.290 (86.1%) patients received limb salvage procedures. Reconstruction strategies including biological reconstruction, such as autograft, allograft, distraction osteogenesis and non-biological prosthetic replacement. The patients received limb salvage procedures tended to have a higher MSTS score (77.1% vs 70.9%, P\u202f=\u202f.055) and a higher incidence of local relapse (28/290 vs 0/47, P\u202f=\u202f.052) than those amputated. Biological reconstruction methods provided better functional outcome (78.4% vs 72.2%, P\u202f=\u202f.017) compared with non-biological prosthetic reconstruction, although similarity of incidence of major complications (51/253 vs 12/37, P\u202f=\u202f.091). With respect to the comparison between autograft and allograft reconstruction, the autograft seemed to have less major postoperative complications occurrence (27/165 vs 22/78, P\u202f=\u202f.032), and consequently better functional outcome (MSTS score, 80.2% vs 74.3%, P\u202f=\u202f.025) than allograft reconstruction.Limb salvage results in better functional outcome compared with amputation. Biological reconstruction is more advocated than prosthetics replacement, and furthermore, autograft might be suggested to be the optimal reconstructive method with regard to better postoperative functional outcome and less major complications.",

Characteristics of failure and time to failure were recorded and analyzed. In addition, a systematically search of published literatures regarding the use of ECIR for osteosarcoma was conducted. Failure rates and modes of failure were determined from the pooled data.In the cohort study, the overall reconstruction failure was 46% (23 of 50 cases) of which 6% were due to mechanical failure, and 40% were due to non-mechanical failure. In the systematic review, 164 cases reached the criteria for analysis (50 diaphysis, 97 osteochondral of lower extremity, 6 knee resection, and 11 proximal humerus resection). Among those cases, overall failure rate was 29.9% (49 of 164 cases) of which 7.9% were due to mechanical failure, and 22.0% to non-mechanical failure.

     "abstract": "Bone metastases (BMs) are common in patients with prostate cancer and can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs), which are associated with increased pain and reduced quality of life (QoL). Bone-targeted agents (BTAs), such as zoledronic acid and denosumab, reduce the incidence of SREs and delay progression of bone pain.We evaluated the management of BMs and pain in six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK) using the Adelphi Prostate Cancer Disease Specific Programme. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were used to assess the impact of BMs on pain and QoL.In total, 358 physicians completed Patient Record Forms, of whom 246 were oncologists and 112 were urologists. Data were collected on 3667 patients with prostate cancer, including 1971 with BMs and 551 with metastases at sites other than bone (non-BMs). PROs were assessed in 573 patients with BMs and 220 with non-BMs. Most patients with BMs (74%) received a BTA and 53% received treatment within 3 months of BM diagnosis. Patients treated by oncologists were more likely than those treated by urologists to receive a BTA (78% vs. 60%) and to have treatment initiated within 3 months of BM diagnosis (56% vs. 43%). For patients who did not receive a BTA, the main reasons for not treating were very recent BM diagnosis and a perceived low risk of bone complications. Data collected by physicians showed that most patients with BMs (97%) were taking analgesics, with 30% receiving strong opioids. Despite this, 70% were currently experiencing bone pain and 28% were experiencing moderate to severe pain. PRO pain measures showed that 70% of patients with BMs were experiencing moderate to extreme pain, suggesting a disparity between pain levels reported by physicians and by patients.Although most patients with BMs receive a BTA, there remain a proportion of patients who are not receiving adequate treatment to prevent SREs or manage pain. Oncologists are more likely to adhere to clinical guidelines than urologists for the prescription of BTAs. Bone pain is common and undertreated. Increasing awareness of SRE prevention and bone pain management might improve patient care.",

     "abstract": "This study used a clinical dataset to investigate the proportion of the newly found bone lesions in malignant patients diagnosed by biopsy as being benign, malignant but unrelated to the primary malignancy, or bone metastases of the primary malignancy. The clinical factors that might affect the correlation between bone lesions and the primary malignancy were also analyzed. It is expected to obtain some information contributing to the clinical decision-making regarding the need for biopsy of these lesions from the research results.Data from patients with a single known malignant tumor who had undergone biopsy of newly found bone lesions at our research institution between January 2012 and December 2017 were reviewed. Based on the pathology results, included cases were divided into a bone-metastasis-of-primary-tumor group (Group 1) and a non-bone-metastasis-of-primary-tumor group (Group 2). The sex, age, diagnostic interval time between the primary malignancy and bone lesions, clinical symptoms, number of involved bones, sites of bone biopsy, and 18F-FDG PET/CT results were compared between groups.A total of 117 patients (92 in Group 1 and 25 in Group 2) were included in the study. There was no significant difference in the sex, age or diagnostic interval time between patient groups. Of all the cases, 17.9% (21/117) were identified to be benign lesions such as fibrous dysplasia (n\u202f=\u202f2), bone tuberculosis (n\u202f=\u202f1), simple bone cyst (n\u202f=\u202f1), aneurysmal bone cyst (n\u202f=\u202f1), or solitary fibrous tumor (n\u202f=\u202f1). Meanwhile, 3.4% (4/117) were new malignancies including chondrosarcoma (n\u202f=\u202f1), plasmacytoma (n\u202f=\u202f1) and bone metastases unrelated to the primary malignancy (n\u202f=\u202f2). Bone metastases pertinent to the primary tumor accounted for 78.6% (92/117) of cases. Liver (n\u202f=\u202f18), kidney (n\u202f=\u202f14), breast (n\u202f=\u202f13) and lung (n\u202f=\u202f12) were the most common cancers among cases. Cases with clinical symptoms exhibited a higher likelihood of their bone lesions being diagnosed as bone metastases of their primary malignancy than those without clinical symptoms (81.3% (87/107) vs. 50.0% (5/10)) (P\u202f=\u202f0.021). Neither the number of bone lesions nor the biopsy sites appeared to influence whether the bone lesions were metastases of the primary malignancy or not. In PET/CT examination, the mean maximum standardized uptake values of the two groups were similar.This study indicated that more than 1/5 of newly identified bone lesions in patients with a single known malignancy were not clinically associated with their primary tumors. Furthermore, 3.4% of these were newly discovered malignant bone tumors. The presence of clinical symptoms may be a significant factor affecting whether a new bone lesion is clinically linked to a patient's primary malignancy. Based on the experience from these patients, as for the newly found bone lesions, it is worthy to perform an active biopsy on those asymptomatic ones to avoid misdiagnosis and less biopsy on symptomatic ones for the sake of less cost and risks.",

Only rarely is optimal treatment involving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by en bloc excision possible. The purpose of this study was to study treatment, neurologic and oncologic outcome in patients with ES of the mobile spine.Methods: Twenty-four patients diagnosed between 1986 and 2012 were identified through the Scandinavian Sarcoma Group registry. Charts were reviewed in order to assess details in patient characteristics, neurologic status, treatment and outcome. Prognostic factors were analyzed with respect to local control, disease-free survival and overall survival.Results: Neurologic symptoms were frequently observed at presentation, being present in 19/23 patients with documented neurologic status. Most (13/19) patients had a complete neurologic recovery regardless of whether or not emergency decompressive surgery was performed. The majority (18/24) of patients were treated with definitive radiotherapy. However, only 9/17 received the recommended dose of \u202f\u2265\u202f\u202f50.4\u00a0Gy. The disease-free and overall survival rates at 10 years were 48% and 57%, respectively. The local recurrence rates were 19% and 27% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Only year of diagnosis, categorized into periods with significant changes in chemotherapy protocols, was a significant factor for local recurrence, but there was a trend (p\u202f=\u202f0.06) for an increased risk of a local recurrence if emergency decompressive surgery was performed.Conclusion: Patients with ES of the mobile have a relatively favorable prognosis. Nonetheless, local recurrence rate is high for this group of patients for which local treatment mainly relies on definitive radiotherapy.Emergency decompressive surgery may increase the risk for local recurrence.",

     "abstract": "Progression and recurrence of breast cancer, as well as reduced survival of patients with breast cancer, are associated with chronic stress, a condition known to impact the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and the autonomic nervous system. Preclinical and clinical evidence support the involvement of the sympathetic nervous system in the control of bone remodeling and in pathologies of the skeleton, including bone metastasis. In experimental mouse models of skeletal metastasis, administration of the \u03b2AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO), used as a surrogate\u00a0of\u00a0norepinephrine, the main neurotransmitter of sympathetic neurons, was shown to favor bone colonization of metastatic breast cancer cells via an increase bone marrow vascularity. However, successful extravasation of cancer cells into a distant organ is known to be favored by an activated endothelium, itself stimulated by inflammatory signals. Based on the known association between high sympathetic outflow, the expression of inflammatory cytokines and bone metastasis, we thus asked whether \u03b2AR stimulation in osteoblasts may alter the vascular endothelium to favor cancer cell engraftment within the skeleton. To address this question, we used conditioned medium (CM) from PBS or ISO-treated bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in adhesion assays with bone marrow endothelial cells (BMECs) or the endothelial cell line C166. We found that ISO treatment in differentiated BMSCs led to a robust induction of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). The CM from ISO-treated BMSCs increased the expression of E- and P-selectin in BMECs and the adhesion of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells to these cells in short-term static and dynamic adhesion assays, and a blocking antibody against IL-1\u03b2, but not IL-6, reduced this effect. Direct IL-1\u03b2 treatment of BMECs had a similar effect, whereas the impact of IL-6 treatment on the expression of adhesion molecules by BMECs and on the adhesion of cancer cells to BMECs was negligible. Collectively, these in vitro results suggest that in the context of the multicellular and dynamic bone marrow environment, sympathetic activation and subsequent \u03b2AR stimulation in osteoblasts may profoundly remodel the density but also the activation status of bone marrow vessels to favor the skeletal engraftment of circulating breast cancer cells.",

The mean onset of metastatic bone disease after the first diagnosis of primary cancer was 4.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.07 months (range, 0\u201384 months). Lung (31.4%) was the most common primary cancer followed by liver (14.7%), breast (12.7%), thyroid (7.8%), and renal (3.9%). Eighty-two cases (80.39%) died from the disease such that the median survival was 4.08 months (95% CI 2.57\u20136.17). The significant risk factors were the type of primary tumor (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, HR\u202f=\u202f4.44; 95% CI, 1.99\u20139.90) and ECOG performance status (P\u202f=\u202f0.021, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.11, 95% CI 1.12\u20133.99).Patients with metastatic bone disease of an upper extremity have a limited life expectancy. The type of primary tumor and ECOG performance status were the important prognostic factors that influenced overall survival. Our data help in the management of patients, families, and doctors, so as to avoid over- or under-treatment.",

Our meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively assess the relationship between the expression of LncRNAs, prognosis and clinical pathology in osteosarcoma development.PubMed,Embase,Web of Science,The Cochrane Library,SionMed,CNKI and WanFang databases were carefully searched to identify eligible studies. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the prognostic significance of LncRNAs expression in osteosarcoma. Moreover, meta-regression analysis and subgroup analysis were carried out to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity.A total of 20 studies comprising 1749 patients were included in present meta-analysis. The results showed that the over-expression of LncRNA had a significant correlation with overall survival (OS) (HR\u202f=\u202f2.16, 95% CI:1.68\u20132.79), and was not related to disease free survival (DFS) (HR\u202f=\u202f0.71, 95% CI:0.05\u20139.53).

     "abstract": "Patients with breast cancer are often afflicted by bone metastases, while the establishment and growth of bone metastases depend on interaction between cancer cells and the host environment. Moreover, osteoblasts, which play a vital role in cancer cells survival and colonization, can form an osteogenic niche in early stage of bone metastases. Also, it is widely accepted that there is a genetic determinant during bone metastases. Nephronectin (NPNT) is an extracellular matrix protein which has shown biological activities in breast cancer metastases and osteoblasts differentiation. But the role of NPNT in mediating breast cancer bone metastases remains elusive. In the present study, we revealed that up regulation of NPNT is associated with incidence of bone metastases. What's more, NPNT could significantly enhance the tumor cell clone formation but not proliferation and migration. We further demonstrated that NPNT significantly enhance osteoblast differentiation and tumor adhesion. Thus, we proposed that cancer secreted NPNT may be a novel marker with potential value of prediction and diagnosis of breast cancer bone metastases.",

The concordance indices were high in internal validation (0.726 for OS and 0.731 for CSS) and external validation (0.716 for OS and 0.724 for CSS). Internal and external calibration plots demonstrated a good agreement between nomogram prediction and actual observation.We constructed nomograms that accurately predict OS and CSS of high-grade osteosarcoma patients.

Numerous authors have suggested that screening might allow early chondrosarcoma detection. However, literature-quoted incidences of malignant transformation are highly variable.A systematic review of malignant transformation by sex, exostosin-1 mutation(EXT1), age and site was conducted searching Medline, Embase and CINHAL. Three HME screening strategies were then developed and compared using cost per life-year gained and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).Systematic review: 18 papers with 852 chondrosarcomas were identified. The incidence of chondrosarcoma transformation averaged 4%, 75.2% occurring between ages 20-40 and 56.2% at the pelvis and proximal femur. Screening model: In the general HME population, plain radiographs provided cost per life-year gain of \u00a319,013 compared to \u00a353,392 in MRIs. ICER in MRIs compared to X-rays was \u00a380,218. However, for every generation of HME patients screened over 20 years, X-ray radiation induced 0.65 cancers. Psychological effects of false-positives were marginal. Screening only higher-risk groups (males or EXT1) reduced cost but benefited fewer patients.Our results suggest that annual MRI screening for all HME patients between age 20-40 may be of value. However, the extent of anatomical imaging is subject to debate; it is possible that focused imaging protocols which scan from cervical spine to proximal femur may improve cost-effectiveness.",

The AZURE trial (ISRCTN79831382) was designed to determine whether adjuvant zoledronic acid (ZOL) improves disease outcomes in EBC. Previous analyses showed no effect on overall outcomes but identified benefits in postmenopausal women. Here we present the long-term risks and benefits of adjuvant ZOL with 10-years follow-up.3360 patients with stage II/III breast cancer were included in an academic, international, phase III, randomized, open label trial. Patients were followed up on a regular schedule until 10 years. Patients were randomized on a 1:1 basis to standard adjuvant systemic therapy\u202f+/\u2212 intravenous ZOL 4\u202fmg every 3\u20134 weeks x6, and then at reduced frequency to complete 5 years treatment. The primary outcome was disease free survival (DFS). Secondary outcomes included invasive DFS (IDFS), overall survival (OS), sites of recurrence, skeletal morbidity and treatment outcomes according to primary tumor amplification of the transcription factor, MAF. Pre-planned subgroup analyses focused on interactions between menopausal status and treatment effects.With a median follow up of 117 months [IQR 70.4\u2013120.4), DFS and IDFS were similar in both arms (HRDFS=\u202f0.94, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f0.84\u20131.06, p\u202f=\u202f0.340; HRIDFS=\u202f0.91, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f0.82\u20131.02, p\u202f=\u202f0.116). However, outcomes remain improved with ZOL in postmenopausal women (HRDFS=\u202f0.82, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f0.67\u20131.00; HRIDFS=\u202f0.78, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f0.64\u20130.94).

ZOL did not improve disease outcomes in MAF FISH\u202f+\u202ftumors. Bone metastases as a first DFS recurrence (BDFS) were reduced with ZOL (HRB-DFS=\u202f0.76, 95%CI\u202f=\u202f0.63\u20130.92, p\u202f=\u202f0.005). ZOL reduced skeletal morbidity with fewer fractures and skeletal events after disease recurrence. 30 cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw in the ZOL arm (1.8%) have occurred.Disease benefits with adjuvant ZOL in postmenopausal early breast cancer persist at 10 years of follow-up.

Our purpose was to clarify whether these two polymorphisms are associated with the outcome of chemotherapy in a cohort of Chinese osteosarcoma (OS) patients treated by high-dose MTX.109 OS patients who had sequentially received high-dose MTX therapy were included in this study. Plasma MTX level was measured routinely at 0, 24, 48 and 72\u202fh after the administration of MTX. Two variants of MTHFR were genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, including rs1801133 (C667T) and rs1801131 (A1298C). The extent of toxicity induced by MTX, including hematological toxicity, hepatic toxicity, renal toxicity and mucositis, was scored from grade 1 to 4. Severe toxicity was defined as a grade score of \u22653. Patients were dichotomized as follows: grade <3 or \u22653 for toxicity, and \u22640.2\u00a0\u00b5mol/L or >0.2\u00a0\u00b5mol/L for plasma MTX level at 72\u202fh. The frequencies of genotypes and allele were compared between the dichotomized groups with the Chi-square test.24.8% (27/109) of the patients were found to have significantly high plasma MTX level at the 72\u202fh. Patients with high MTX level at 72\u202fh were found to have significantly higher frequency of genotype TT of rs1801133 (p\u202f=\u202f0.002). As for rs1801131, no significant association was found with plasma MTX level. Patients with severe hepatic toxicity or mucositis were found to have remarkably higher incidence of genotype TT of rs1801133 than those with mild toxicity (33.3% vs. 14.8%, p\u202f=\u202f0.04 for hepatic toxicity; 34.8% vs. 19.8%, p\u202f=\u202f0.05 for mucositis).Variant rs1801133 was confirmed to have remarkable influence on the MTX-induced toxicity. We recommend identification of the genotype of MTHFR variant prior to the application of high-dose MTX to OS patients, which could be an important predictor to screen severe toxicities and thus improve treatment outcomes.",

Although new therapies for MM have greatly improved survival, MM remains incurable for most patients. Despite the major advances in current anti-MM and anti-resorptive treatments that can significantly improve osteolytic bone lysis, many bone lesions can persist even after therapeutic remission of active disease. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) from MM patients are phenotypically distinct from their healthy counterparts and the mechanisms associated with the long-term osteogenic suppression are largely unknown. In this review we will highlight recent results of transcriptomic profiling studies that provide new insights into the establishment and maintenance of the persistent pathological alterations in MM-BMSCs that occur in MM. We will we discuss the role of genomic instabilities and senescence in propagating the chronically suppressed state and pro-inflammatory phenotype associated with MM-BMSCs. Lastly we describe the role of epigenetic-based mechanisms in regulating osteogenic gene expression to establish and maintain the pro-longed suppression of MM-BMSC differentiation into functional OBs.",

One randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT) study, two autopsy studies, five register studies, and twenty retrospective cohort studies. The studies described different cohorts making direct comparison difficult. Three studies analysed the effect of different treatments for BM including one RCT study.The incidence of bone metastases was 3\u20137% in patients with CRC, and it was not possible to detect an increase in incidence over time. The most well established risk factors for BM are rectal cancer, having lymph node invasion at surgery of primary tumor, and lung metastases at any time. Other risk factors such as RAS mutation status have been suggested but results are not conclusive. Survival ranges from 5 to 21 months after diagnosis of BM depending on cohort, with survival of about 8 months in unselected patients. Several variables have been suggested as potential prognostic markers but are all poorly investigated. Treatment of BM is not well investigated, though patients seem to benefit from bisphosphonate treatment with regard to lower risk of skeletal related events.

Hospital stay (HS), time to symptom relief (TTSR), recovery time (RT), complications, relapse-free survival (RFS), health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and cost-effectiveness were analyzed for each strategy.HS, TTSR and RT in the LDC group were shorter than those in the surgery group (p\u202f<\u202f0.01). Chemotherapy-related complications included nausea (16.30%), aminotransferase elevation (9.30%), slight hair loss (11.63%), decline in immune function (23.26%), growth retardation (16.30%), and moon face (9.30%). Chemotherapy-related side effects were mild and well tolerated. Pathologic fractures (6.81%), loosening of instrumentation (6.00%,), surgical site infection (4.00%) and rejection of bone grafting (9.09%) developed in surgery patients. LDC treatment resulted in a longer RFS (87 months) than surgery alone (59 months) (p\u202f=\u202f0.011).

Independent prognostic factors for SMFS and OS were extracted using univariate and multivariate analyses, the Kaplan\u2013Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model.The mean time between primary diagnoses and spinal metastases was 46.8 (median 41, range 0\u2013147 months) months. The analysis showed that lymph node metastasis (p\u202f=\u202f0.043, HR 10.498, 95%CI 1.074\u2013102.588) and estrogen receptor (ER) status (p\u202f=\u202f0.004, HR 0.368, 95%CI 0.189\u20130.721) can significantly affect SMFS. Furthermore, visceral metastasis (p\u202f=\u202f0.042, HR 2.383, 95%CI 1.032\u20135.501), multiple metastases (p\u202f=\u202f0.035, HR 2.538, 95%CI 1.066\u20136.048) and post-op chemotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.003, HR 0.312, 95%CI 0.144\u20130.675) have significant effects on OS. Lastly, patients identified as Luminal A subtype have longer OS.Lymph node metastases and ER status are independent risk factors in predicting BCSM. Moreover, visceral metastasis, multiple metastases of the spine and post-op chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors. Luminal subtypes have higher rate, but late onset of spine metastases and prolonged survival.",

We aimed to investigate whether variants of FasL, MSH2, ABCC5, CASP3 and CYP3A4 are associated with the outcome after chemotherapy-based treatment in osteosarcoma.132 osteosarcoma patients who had completed the neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our center were included. 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed from the initial treatment to the earliest sign of disease progression or death from any cause. 5 SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay, including rs763110 of FasL, rs4638843 of MSH2, rs939338 of ABCC5, rs2720376 of CASP3 and rs4646437 of CYP3A4. Patients were classified into two groups according to the 5-year PFS (event/no event). The chi-square test was used to analyze difference of genotype frequency. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the independent predictors of the PFS rate.The overall 5-year PFS was 61.4% (81/132). Genotype TT/CT of rs763110 and genotype GG/AG of rs939338 were significantly associated with the event of 5-year PFS (p\u202f=\u202f0.028 for rs763110; p\u202f=\u202f0.039 for rs939338).

The present study aims at analyzing the data on Ewing sarcoma cases of bone from the National Cancer Registry Programme, India to provide incidence, patterns, and trends in the Indian population.The data of five Population Based Cancer Registries (PBCR) of Bangalore, Mumbai, Chennai, Bhopal and Delhi over 30 years period (1982\u2013 2011) were used to calculate the Age Specific and Age Standardized Incidence Rates (ASpR and ASIR), and trends in incidence was analyzed by linear and Joinpoint Regression.Ewing sarcoma comprised around 15 % of all bone malignancies. Sixty-eight percent were 0\u201319 years, with 1.6 times risk of tumour in bones of limbs as compared to other bones. The highest incidence rate (per million) was in the 10\u201314 years age group (male \u22124.4, female \u22122.9) with significantly increasing trend in ASpR observed in both sexes. Pooled ASIR per million for all ages was higher in male (1.6) than female (1.0) with an increasing rate ratio of ASIR with increase in age. Trend of pooled ASIR for all ages was significantly increased in both sexes. Twelve percent cases were reported in \u226530 years of age.This paper has described population based measurements on burden and trends in incidence of skeletal Ewing in India. These may steer further research questions on the clinical and molecular epidemiology to explain factors associated with the increasing incidence of Ewing sarcoma bone observed in India.",

Despite the advances in both systemic immunotherapy and localized radiation, it is still difficult to treat brain metastasis, with less than 12 months of survival from the time of diagnosis for most patients. Currently, there is interest in combining strategies to take advantage of the potential synergy. In this study, the mouse model of metastatic osteosarcoma to brain was used to explore the ability of local radiation and anti-PD-1 blockade to induce beneficial anti-tumor immune responses against distant, unirradiated brain metastatic tumors. Immune markers from the peripheral blood and tumor tissue were analyzed by flow cytometry, real-time PCR and western blot. The combination treatment produced a stronger systemic anti-tumor response than either treatment alone, shown by the reduced tumor burden and larger numbers of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells in the unirradiated tumors, indicating an abscopal effect. These data suggested that combination treatment of irradiation with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy can induce abscopal anti-tumor responses and improve both local and distant control.",

When the local excision is not complete, the risk of recurrence is high, and hence, one-piece resection is necessary. The major challenge for clinicians is to reconstruct the bone after resection of the tumor. The present study investigated the efficacy of 3-dimensional (3D) printing technique in the treatment of benign fibrous histiocytoma of the scapula.The patient with benign fibrous histiocytoma of scapular bone was treated with PEEK (polyetheretherketone) prosthesis replacement using the 3D printing technique. X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scans evaluated the relationship between the position of the prosthesis and that of the shoulder joint. Also, the constant score of the shoulder joint was calculated.The anteroposterior radiograph showed that the position of the left scapula prosthesis is satisfactory and that of the shoulder joint is normal. Three months after the operation, the X-ray examination indicated the lack of flexibility and shift, as well as, dislocation and disjunction of PEEK prosthesis. The constant score of the left shoulder function was 68 points. Active shoulder joint activity: 120\u00b0 on the lift, 90\u00b0 on abduction, 50\u00b0 on the external rotation, and 70\u00b0 on internal rotation.The application of 3D-printed PEEK scapula prosthesis with total shoulder replacement offers the possibility of accurate reconstruction, improves the operability of surgery, shortens the operation time, and allows early functional recovery of the patients.",

A poor therapeutic response to the conventional chemotherapy is observed with the development of lung metastases, highlighting the need for improving the current regimens and the identification of early markers of the recurrent and metastatic disease. Circulating Tumour Cells (CTCs) play a key role in the metastatic process and could be powerful biomarkers of the progressive disease. The present study aimed to isolate CTCs by using a pre-clinical model of human osteosarcoma and to monitor their kinetic of release and their modulation by ifosfamide. CTCs were detectable into the bloodstream before any palpable primary tumors. Ifosfamide increased CTCs count and in contrast decreased the number of lung tumor nodules. On established tumors, ifosfamide slowed down the tumour growth and did not modulate CTC count that could be explained by a release of cancer cells from the primary tumour with reduced properties for inducing lung metastases. This report highlights the biological interest of CTCs in osteosarcoma.",

The study population included post-menopausal women with early breast cancer, diagnosed between 2002 and 2012. Data on cancer characteristics, diagnosis of osteoporosis, prior bisphosphonate exposure and outcome were collected from medical files.Among 297 osteoporotic women identified, 145 (49%) were treated with bisphosphonates (alendronate in 90% of the cases) before cancer diagnosis. BP-treated women were significantly older than the BP-na\u00efve ones (67.9 years vs 64.6 years, p\u202f=\u202f0.01), but comparable in risk factors and disease characteristics. Over a mean follow up of 5.6 years, nine cases of bone metastases were identified, eight of them among BP-na\u00efve patient (cumulative incidence of 9.9%) and one among BP-treated patients (0.7%). In a multivariable Cox's proportional hazards survival model the use of BP prior to cancer diagnosis was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.04 (95%CI:0.004\u20130.403, p\u202f=\u202f0.006) for bone metastasis.

     "abstract": "Quantifying the incidence of giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is challenging because it is a rare, histologically benign bone tumor for which population-level statistics are unavailable in most countries. We estimated the 2017 incidence of GCT in China using a direct (registry-based) approach with available population-based data.The most recent age- and sex-specific incidence rates of GCT recorded in the Bone Tumor Registry in Japan (2015) were applied to 2017 age- and sex-matched populations projected by the United Nations for China in order to estimate 2017 incidence. An adjustment factor calculated using registry data suggesting that GCT may represent a greater proportion of bone tumors in China than in Japan (Guo, 1999) was applied to provide secondary estimates.Annual GCT incidence was estimated to be 1.49 per million population or 2094 new cases in China for 2017. A comparison of this estimated incidence with Japan (1.25 per million) and the United States (1.38 per million) indicates that the incidence is somewhat higher in China using identical methods. Secondary estimates suggest that GCT incidence in China may be as high as 2.57 per million or 3625 new cases in 2017. The corresponding 3-year limited-duration prevalence of GCT in China using a registry-based approach and general age-specific mortality is 6276 (secondary estimate: 10,876).Leveraging unique population-based registry data, we estimated that GCT is a rare disease in the Chinese population with an incidence ranging between 1.49 and 2.57 cases per million persons per year. Possible differences in diagnostic classification of GCT, urban-rural demographics, and the younger demographic distribution of the Chinese population may underlie observations that GCT, a condition that primarily affects young individuals (20\u201340 years of age), accounts for a higher proportion of skeletal tumors in China than in other regions.",

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma and chondrosarcoma are the three main entities of bone sarcoma which collectively encompass more than 50 heterogeneous entities of rare malignancies. In contrast to osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma which mainly affect adolescents and young adults and exhibit a high propensity to metastasise to the lungs, chondrosarcoma is more frequently observed after 40 years of age and is characterised by a high frequency of local recurrence. The combination of chemotherapy, surgical resection and radiotherapy has contributed to an improved outcome for these patients. However, a large number of patients still suffer significant therapy related toxicities or die of refractory and metastatic disease. To better delineate the pathogenesis of bone sarcomas and to identify and test new therapeutic options, major efforts have been invested over the past decades in the development of relevant pre-clinical animal models. Nowadays, in vivo models aspire to mimic all the steps and the clinical features of the human disease as accurately as possible and should ideally be manipulable. Considering these features and given their small size, their conduciveness to experiments, their affordability as well as their human-like bone-microenvironment and immunity, murine pre-clinical models are interesting in the context of these pathologies. This chapter will provide an overview of the murine models of bone sarcomas, paying specific attention for the models induced by inoculation of tumour cells.

     "abstract": "Bone metastases (BMs) are common in patients with breast cancer and can lead to skeletal-related events (SREs), which are associated with increased pain and reduced quality of life (QoL). Bone-targeted agents (BTAs), like zoledronic acid and denosumab, reduce the incidence of SREs and delay progression of bone pain.We evaluated the management of BMs and pain in six European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and UK) using the Adelphi Breast Cancer Disease Specific Programme, which included a physician survey and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to assess the impact of BMs on pain and QoL.301 physicians completed patient record forms for 2984 patients with advanced breast cancer; 1408 with BMs and 1136 with metastases at sites other than bone (non-BMs). Most patients with BMs (88%) received a BTA, with 81% receiving treatment during 3 months following BM diagnosis. For those who did not receive a BTA, the main reasons given were: very recent BM diagnosis, perceived low risk of bone complications, and short life expectancy. Most patients with BMs (68%) were experiencing bone pain and, of these, 97% were taking analgesics (including 28% receiving strong opioids). Despite this, moderate to severe pain was reported in 20% of patients who were experiencing pain. PROs were assessed in 766 patients with advanced breast cancer (392 with BMs, 374 with non-BMs). Overall, patients with BMs reported worse pain and QoL outcomes than those with non-BMs, those not receiving a BTA reported worse pain.Despite the large proportion of patients receiving BTAs in this study, some patients with BMs are still not receiving early treatment to prevent SREs or to manage pain. Improving physicians\u2019 understanding of the role of BTAs and the importance of early treatment following BM diagnosis has the potential to improve patient care.",

     "abstract": "Telangiectatic osteosarcoma (TOS), a rare variant of osteosarcoma, may be easily misdiagnosed as aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC). The aims of this study were to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic factors of TOS by reviewing our experience with TOS and to develop a diagnostic model that may distinguish TOS from ABC.We identified 51 cases of TOS treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-Sen University from March 2001 to January 2016 and reviewed their records, imaging information and pathological studies. A diagnostic model was developed to differentiate TOS and ABC by Bayes discriminant analysis and was evaluated. The log-rank test was used to analyze the prognostic factors of TOS and to compare the outcome differences between TOS and other high-grade osteosarcoma subtypes.The multi-disciplinary diagnostic method employed that combined clinical, imaging, and pathological studies enhanced the diagnostic accuracy. Age 18 years or younger and pathologic fracture were more common among the TOS patients than among the ABC patients (P = .004 and .005, respectively). The average white blood cell (WBC), platelet, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) values of the TOS patients were higher than those of the ABC patients (P = .002, .003, .007, and .007, respectively). Our diagnostic model, including the aforementioned factors, accurately predicted 62% and 78% of the TOS patients in the training and validation sets, respectively. The 5-year estimates of event-free survival and overall survival of the TOS patients were 52.5 \u00b1 9.4% and 54.9 \u00b1 8.8%, respectively, which were similar to those of patients with other osteosarcoma subtypes (P = .950 and .615, respectively). Tumor volume and the LDH level were predictive prognostic factors (P = .040 and .044) but not the presence of pathologic fracture or misdiagnosis (P = .424 and .632, all respectively).The multi-disciplinary diagnostic method and diagnostic model based on predictive factors, i.e., age, the presence of pathologic fracture, and platelet, LDH, ALP and WBC levels, aided the differentiation of TOS and ABC. Smaller tumors and normal LDH levels were associated with better outcomes.",

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most widespread primary carcinoma in bones. Osteosarcoma cells are highly metastatic and frequently develop resistance to chemotherapy making this disease harder to treat. This identifies an urgent need of novel therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma. G-Protein-coupled receptor 137 (GPR137) is involved in several human cancers and may be a novel therapeutic target.The expression of GPR137 was assessed in one osteoblast and three human osteosarcoma cell lines via the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays. Stable GPR137 knockdown cell lines were established using an RNA interference lentivirus system. Viability, colony formation, and flow cytometry assays were performed to measure the effects of GPR137 depletion on cell growth. The underlying molecular mechanism was determined using signaling array analysis and western blot assays.GPR137 expression was higher in the three human osteosarcoma cell lines, Saos-2, U2OS, and SW1353, than in osteoblast hFOB 1.19 cells. Lentivirus-mediated small interfering RNA targeting GPR137 successfully knocked down GPR137 mRNA and protein expression in both Saos-2 and U2OS cells. In the absence of GPR137, cell viability and colony formation ability were seriously impaired. The extent of apoptosis was also increased in both cell lines. Moreover, AMP-activated protein kinase \u03b1, proline-rich AKT substrate of 40\u00a0kDa, AKT, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation levels were down-regulated in GPR137 knockdown cells.The results of this study highlight the crucial role of GPR137 in promoting osteosarcoma cell growth in vitro. GPR137 could serve as a potential therapeutic target against osteosarcoma.",

Studies confirmed the associations between MDSC and various cytokines in the peripheral blood. However, little is known about the association between parenchymal MDSC subsets and cytokines, or the mechanism drawing MDSC into tumor parenchyma. This study was to analyze the correlation between MDSC subsets and CCL2 level in lung cancer model. G-MDSC and M-MDSC from the blood and parenchyma were analyzed by flow cytometry and western blot in the lung tumor model. CCL2 was detected by ELISA assay, real-time PCR, western blot and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of combination treatment combining CCL2 antagonist and anti-PD1 antibody were assessed. Results showed that MDSC subsets had a positive correlation with CCL2, suggesting CCL2 may attract MDSC into the parenchyma. Gene and protein expression of CCL2, as well as the CCL2 surface expression significantly increased in blood and tumor of tumor-bearing mice. Anti-CCL2 treatment decreased G-MDSC and M-MDSC in the periphery and tumor through inhibiting the protein expression of arginase 1 and iNOS. In addition, combination therapy enhanced CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration, as well as the production of interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), and increased the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. Our study provided potential new target to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer, in addition to elucidate a possible association between MDSC subsets and the cytokine drawing MDSC migration into the tumor tissue.",

     "abstract": "Although chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) has been shown to preserve organ function and improve cosmetic results, site-specific data, especially mandible, are limited. The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictability of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) on response to super-selective intra-arterial CRT for advanced SCC of the mandible.Fifteen patients with advanced SCC of the mandible underwent super-selective intra-arterial CRT followed by radical resection. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of the mandibular lesion was evaluated with FDG-PET/CT before and after CRT. The SUVmax before and after CRT was defined as pre-SUVmax and post-SUVmax, respectively. The difference between pre- and post-SUVmax was calculated as SUVmax reduction rate to evaluate treatment response of the mandibular lesion. Each SUVmax reduction rate and surgical specimen of the corresponding lesion was analyzed to evaluate an accuracy of the modality for predicting pathological response.The median of pre-SUVmax was significantly lower than that of post-SUVmax (p = 0.001). Of the 15 patients, 6 had a pathological complete response (pCR) and 9 had a non-pCR. Neither pCR patients nor non-pCR patients showed significant difference of the median of SUVmax between pre- and post-CRT (pre-CRT p = 0.099 post-CRT p =0.074). The SUVmax reduction rate in patients with pCR was significantly higher than that with non-pCR (p = 0.002). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the optimal cut-off point of the reduction rate was 64.7%, with 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity.These results concluded that SUVmax reduction rate can predict pathological complete response of preoperative super-selective intra-arterial CRT for advanced SCC of the mandible.",

However, there is still a lack of knowledge concerning its role in osteosarcoma (OS). In this study, we aimed to investigate the influence of ANRIL on cell proliferation and invasion of OS and to determine its association with clinicopathological features of the patients.The tumor specimens and the adjacent normal tissues were collected from 57 OS patients and the expression level of ANRIL was quantified by RT-qPCR. High expression of ANRIL was defined as a relative mRNA expression of >\u202f1.5 fold (tumor/normal). Knockdown of ANRIL was performed in human OS cell lines to investigate its influence on cell proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. In addition, expression of downstream genes in the transfected cells were determined by Western blot.The expression level of ANRIL was significantly increased in OS tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues. 33 patients were included in the high expression group and the other 24 patients were included in the normal expression group. ANRIL expression was significantly associated with tumor size (5.7\u202fcm\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.4\u202fcm vs. 4.3\u202fcm\u202f\u00b1\u202f1.7\u202fcm, p\u202f=\u202f0.02) and the 5-year survival rate (51.5% vs. 79.1%, p\u202f=\u202f0.03). Knockdown of ANRIL could significantly induce cell apoptosis and inhibit cell proliferation and invasion. Moreover, knockdown of ANRIL could significantly decrease the expression level of phosphorylated PI3K and AKT in OS cells.Upregulated expression of ANRIL is associated with the tumor development and prognosis of OS. ANRIL may regulate the function of OS cells through the AKT pathway.",

Published prospective and retrospective papers investigating BM and SREs in breast cancer patients in non-trial settings were identified and systematically reviewed.Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria. Incidences of BM based on new diagnosis, length of BM-free interval (BMFI) and number and sites of BM were detected by 17 of 24 studies.

Developments of SREs regarding the occurrence ratio of total and specific SREs, SERs-free interval (SREFI) and the first-line therapy for SREs were observed in 16 of 24 studies. Out of 5 studies, we extracted uni- and multivariate analysis of risk factor for SREs and out of 16 studies - predictors for survival in breast cancer patients with BM.BM and SREs are common problems in non-trial breast cancer populations. Patient demographics, clinical stage, tumor pathological type, molecular receptors status are significantly risk factors for incidence of BM, SREs and the survival. The unique characteristics of BM and SREs in breast cancer patients should be taken into account in future randomized controlled trials, as to optimize individual treatment options and assure a maximally long good quality of life.",

High risk bone metastases were defined by either: occurrence of a prior SRE, bone pain, radiologic progression of bone metastases and/or serum C-terminal telopeptide (CTx) levels > 400\u00a0ng/L despite pamidronate use. Serum samples were collected at baseline and weeks 1, 4, 8 and 12 (CTx and BSAP) and baseline and week 12 (NTx and BSP), and all putative biomarkers were measured by ELISA. Follow up was extended to 2 years post trial entry for risk of subsequent SREs. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate time-to-event outcomes. Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to evaluate if laboratory values over time or the change in laboratory values from baseline were associated with having a SRE within the time frame of this study.From March 2012 to May 2014, 76 patients were screened, with 73 eligible for enrolment. All 73 patients were available for biochemical analysis, with 35 patients receiving pamidronate and 38 patients receiving zoledronate. The GEE analysis found that no laboratory value was associated with having a subsequent SRE. Interaction between visit and laboratory values was also investigated, but no interaction effect was statistically significant. Only increased number of lines of prior hormonal treatment was associated with subsequent SRE risk.Our analysis failed to find any association between serum BSAP, BSP, CTx or NTx levels and subsequent SRE risk in this cohort of patients. This lack of correlation between serum biomarkers and clinical outcomes could be due to influences of prior bisphosphonate treatment or presence of extra-osseous metastases in a significant proportion of enrolled patients. As such, caution should be used in biomarker interpretation and use to direct decision making regarding SRE risk for high risk patients in this setting.",

Based on the x-ray, CT and MRI imaging, the radiographic features of soft tissue recurrence were classified into 3 types. Type I was defined as soft tissue recurrence with peripheral ossification, type II was defined as soft tissue recurrence with central ossification, and type III was defined as pure soft tissue recurrence without ossification. Demographic data including period of recurrence and follow-up duration after the second surgery were recorded for these 6 patients.

The mean interval between initial surgery and recurrence was 11.3 \u00b1 4.1 months (range, 5\u201317). The recurrence lesions were located in the thigh of 2 patients, in the forearm of 2 patients and in the leg of the other 2 patients.

The cell viability, migration and invasion ability of U2-OS cells were significantly increased by ER\u03b2 siRNA, but inhibited by ER\u03b2 agonists LY294002 (p < 0.05). ER\u03b2 siRNA significantly downregulated Integrin \u03b15 and unregulated IAP in U2-OS cells (p < 0.05). The expression of p-p65, p-AKT and Bcl-2 was significantly reduced by LY294002, but increased by ER\u03b2 siRNA (p < 0.05). In conclusion, ER\u03b2 exhibited obvious anti-tumor effects on osteosarcoma cells by regulating integrin, IAP, NF-kBBCL-2 and PI3K/Akt signal pathway.",

Lung metastases were accounting for 59.8% of the BMs (\u03c72 = 17.7, p<0.01) and hepatic metastases were accounting for 34.3% of BMs (\u03c72 = 3.06,p >0.05). BMs were diagnosed more rapidly in the presence of lung metastases(6.9 months versus 11.6 months for liver metastases). Univariate analysis revealed that BMs were associated with primary tumor location (p < 0.001), lung metastases (p < 0.001), initial stage (p = 0.001), radiotherapy (p < 0.001) and serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (p=0.001).

In this study, we investigate the correlation between diverse clinical factors and bone metastases secondary from renal cell cancer (RCC), and to identify potential risk factors for bone metastasis in newly diagnosed patients and those who have already received treatment.The clinical data of 372 patients with RCC were reviewed from January 2000 to August 2016. The correlations between age, gender, histopathologic types, alkaline phosphotase (ALP), CEA, AFP, CA-125, CA-153, CA-199, calcium, hemoglobin (HB) and bone metastases were analyzed. And the risk factors for bone metastases in RCC were identified by multivariate logistic regression analysis. The cutoff value, sensitivity and specificity of the independent correlation factors were calculated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve.The bone is the second to the lung as a distant metastasis target site in patients with RCC. Thirty eight individuals were identified with bone metastases. Of these patients, significantly higher levels of ALP, calcium, HB were found than those without bone metastasis (P < 0.05, respectively). No significant differences were detected in CEA, AFP, CA-125, CA-153, CA-199, age, gender and histopathologic types between patients with and without bone metastases (P > 0.05, respectively). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ALP, calcium and HB were independent risk factors correlated with bone metastasis (P < 0.05, respectively). ROC curves demonstrated these factors had comparable accuracy at predicting bone metastasis (AUC were 0.749, 0.633 and 0.665, respectively). The cutoff values of ALP, calcium and HB were 105.5 U/L, 2.615\u00a0mmol/L and 111.5\u00a0g/L, respectively. The sensitivities of them were 57.9%, 36.8% and 71.1% for predicting bone metastasis, with specificities of 83.5%, 95.2% and 65.3%, respectively.Based on our study, the concentrations of ALP, calcium and HB were potentially risk factors for bone metastasis in patients with RCC. For newly diagnosed patients, if the values of ALP>105.5\u00a0U/L, calcium>2.615\u00a0mmol/L and HB<111.5\u00a0g/L were detected, intensive monitoring and bone scanning are warranted for them.",

Serum from 865 patients taken at randomisation was stored at \u221280\u00a0\u00b0C prior to central batch analysis for inhibin A, oestradiol and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). We assessed the clinical value of pretreatment hormone levels for predicting invasive disease free survival (IDFS), skeletal recurrence and distant recurrence and response to treatment with zoledronic acid.Oestradiol in the postmenopausal range (<50\u00a0pmol/l) was associated with a significantly shorter IDFS (HR 1.36 95%CI: 1.05\u20131.78 p=0.022), predominantly due to distant recurrence (HR 1.33 95%CI: 0.98\u20131.81 p=0.065), compared to oestradiol \u226550pmol/l. In contrast, FSH in the postmenopausal range (>26\u00a0IU/l) was associated with a longer time to bone as first recurrence (HR 0.66 95%CI: 0.41\u20131.04 p=0.072) compared to an FSH \u226426\u00a0IU/l.

Biochemical evaluation of a panel of reproductive hormones may be helpful to assist selection of patients for adjuvant zoledronic acid when menopausal status is unknown.",

Most of the reports of reconstruction after scapulectomy are from a single institution. In the present study, we investigated functional outcomes after total scapulectomy in a multicenter study in The Eastern Asian Musculoskeletal Oncology Group (EAMOG). Thirty-three patients who underwent total scapulectomy were registered at EAMOG affiliated hospitals. The patients were separated into no reconstruction group (n=8), humeral suspension group (n=15) and prosthesis group (n=10). Functional outcome was assessed by the Enneking score. One-way ANOVA was used to compare parameters between the patient groups. Complications included five local recurrences, one superficial infection, one dislocation and one clavicle protrusion. The average follow-up period was 43.5\u00a0 months. The average active flexion range was 45.8\u00b0 (0\u2013120\u00b0), and 37.1\u00b0 in abduction (0\u2013120\u00b0). The mean total functional score was 22.9 out of 30 (15\u201329), which is a satisfactory score following resection of the shoulder girdle. There were significant differences in reconstruction methods for active range of motion. Bony reconstruction provided better range of motion in this study. There was a variety of reconstruction methods after scapulectomy in the eastern Asian countries. Although better functional score was obtained using scapular prosthesis or recycled bone and prosthesis composite grafting, postoperative function is still lower than preoperative function. Modified designed prosthesis with or without combination of recycle bone or allograft would restore the lost shoulder function in the future.",

The association between MDSC and various cytokines has been studied in the peripheral blood. However, little is known about the mechanism drawing MDSC into tumor parenchyma. This study was to analyze the correlation between MDSC subsets and interleukin 18 (IL-18) level in osteosarcoma tumor model and its effect on the immunotherapy. MDSC were isolated from the blood and parenchyma and analyzed in the osteosarcoma tumor model. IL-18 levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay, real-time PCR, western blot and flow cytometry. Moreover, combination treatment with IL-18 inhibition and anti-PD1 was conducted to assess the therapeutic effects of IL-18 blockade. Results showed MDSC levels had a positive correlation with IL-18, suggesting IL-18 may attract MDSC into the parenchyma. IL-18 gene and protein expression significantly increased in blood and tumor lysates of tumor-bearing mice. Anti-IL-18 treatment significantly decreased G-MDSC and M-MDSC in the peripheral blood and tumor. Furthermore, combination therapy decreased the tumor burden and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T cell infiltration, as well as the production of interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) and granzyme B. Our study revealed a possible correlation between MDSC subsets and IL-18 inducing MDSC migration into the tumor tissue, in addition to provide the potential target to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy in patients with osteosarcoma.",

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer among those with non-hematological origin and affects mainly pediatric patients. In the last 50 years, refinements in surgical procedures, as well as the introduction of aggressive neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapeutic cocktails, have increased to nearly 70% the survival rate of these patients. Despite the initial therapeutic progress the fight against osteosarcoma has not substantially improved during the last three decades, and almost 30% of the patients do not respond or recur after the standard treatment. For this group there is an urgent need to implement new therapeutic approaches. Oncolytic adenoviruses are conditionally replicative viruses engineered to selectively replicate in and kill tumor cells, while remaining quiescent in healthy cells. In the last years there have been multiple preclinical and clinical studies using these viruses as therapeutic agents in the treatment of a broad range of cancers, including osteosarcoma. In this review, we summarize some of the most relevant published literature about the use of oncolytic adenoviruses to treat human osteosarcoma tumors in subcutaneous, orthotopic and metastatic mouse models. In conclusion, up to date the preclinical studies with oncolytic adenoviruses have demonstrated that are safe and efficacious against local and metastatic osteosarcoma. Knowledge arising from phase I/II clinical trials with oncolytic adenoviruses in other tumors have shown the potential of viruses to awake the patient\u00b4s own immune system generating a response against the tumor. Generating osteosarcoma immune-competent adenoviruses friendly models will allow to better understand this potential. Future clinical trials with oncolytic adenoviruses for osteosarcoma tumors are warranted.",

     "abstract": "More than one pathway is involved in disease development and progression, and two or more pathways may be interconnected to further affect the disease onset, as functional proteins participate in multiple pathways. Thus, identifying cross-talk among pathways is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms of multiple myeloma (MM). Based on this, this paper looked at extracting potential pathway cross-talk in MM through an integrative approach using Monte Carlo cross-validation analysis. The gene expression library of MM (accession number: GSE6477) was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The integrative approach was then used to identify potential pathway cross-talk, and included four steps: Firstly, differential expression analysis was conducted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Secondly, the DEGs obtained were mapped to the pathways downloaded from an ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA), to reveal the underlying relationship between the DEGs and pathways enriched by these DEGs. A subset of pathways enriched by the DEGs was then obtained. Thirdly, a discriminating score (DS) value for each paired pathway was computed. Lastly, random forest (RF) classification was used to identify the paired pathways based on area under the curve (AUC) and Monte Carlo cross-validation, which was repeated 50 times to explore the best paired pathways. These paired pathways were tested with another independently published MM microarray data (GSE85837), using in silico validation. Overall, 60 DEGs and 19 differential pathways enriched by DEGs were extracted. Each pathway was sorted based on their AUC values. The paired pathways, inhibition of matrix metalloproteases and EIF2 signaling pathway, indicated the best AUC value of 1.000. Paired pathways consisting of IL-8 and EIF2 signaling pathways with higher AUC of 0.975, were involved in 7 runs. Furthermore, it was validated consistently in separate microarray data sets (GSE85837). Paired pathways (inhibition of matrix metalloproteases and EIF2 signaling, IL-8 signaling and EIF2 signaling) exhibited the best AUC values and higher frequency of validation. Two paired pathways (inhibition of matrix metalloproteases and EIF2 signaling, IL-8 signaling and EIF2 signaling) were used to accurately classify MM and control samples. These paired pathways may be potential bio-signatures for diagnosis and management of MM.",

Therefore, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to investigate the predictive factors for symptomatic skeletal events (SSEs) in bone-metastasized breast cancer (b-MBC) patients.We retrospectively collected data on b-MBC patients treated with ZA. Patient characteristics, including age, subtype, the presence of non-bone lesions, the presence of multiple bone metastases at the commencement of ZA therapy, duration of ZA therapy, the time interval between breast cancer diagnosis and the initiation of ZA therapy, and type of systemic therapy, presence of previous SSE were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis.The medical records of 183 patients were reviewed and 176 eligible patients were analyzed. The median age was 59 (range, 30\u201387) years. Eighty-seven patients were aged \u226560 years and 89 patients were aged < 60 years. The proportions of patients with estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease were 81.8%, 63.1%, and 17.6%, respectively. Fifty-three patients had bone-only MBC at the commencement of ZA therapy. SSEs were observed in 42 patients. In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, bone-only MBC but not a breast cancer subtype was an independent risk factor for an SSE during ZA therapy (odds ratio: 3.878, 95% confidence interval: 1.647\u20139.481; p = 0.002).Bone-only MBC patients are more likely to experience an SSE even after treatment with ZA.",

     "abstract": "The geographic distribution of osteochondroma (OC) varies greatly around the world. There has been no recent report on OC in a large Chinese population. The aim of this study was to characterize OC by an epidemiological analysis of the clinical data from one medical institution in South China.We searched medical electronic records from January 2001 to January 2016 in one large hospital in South China to identify patients with a definite diagnosis of OC. Their epidemiological data were collected and analyzed statistically, including gender, tumor site, age at first diagnosis and symptoms, local recurrence and malignant transformation. Differences between genders and between solitary osteochondroma (SO) and multiple osteochondroma (MO) were particularly analyzed.A total of 431 OC patients (291 males and 140 females; 329 SOs and 102 MOs) were identified. The gender ratio was 2.08 with a male predominance. OCs were mostly located around the knee (250 cases). 280 patients were in their 0s to 20s upon first diagnosis. The average age at the time of first diagnosis was 20.63 years for all, 18.47 years for males and 25.11 years for females (P=0.000). OC recurred locally in 35 patients (15 SOs and 20 MOs), with a significant difference between SO/MO (P=0.000) but not between genders (P=0.100). The average interval from the primary surgery to local or malignant recurrence was 37.41 months. Malignant transformation was found in 5 patients (4 males and 1 female), showing no gender difference (P=0.549).OC may have a male predominance in Chinese population. It mostly occurred at 0\u201320 years of age and around the knee. Upon the first diagnosis of OC, the males tended to be younger than the females, and so did the MO patients than the SO ones. In addition, MO had a higher incidence of local recurrence. Intervals from primary surgery to local recurrence or malignant transformation in MO patients were longer than in SO patients.",

Sorafenib has emerged as a potentially viable drug to be used in this context.A literature review was conducted evaluating articles pertaining to osteosarcoma and sorafenib.Clinical studies were prioritised, but preclinical data was also evaluated to elaborate on mechanisms and potential targets for the future. Limitations of the review and data were explored.In isolation, sorafenib was shown to only provide brief clinical benefit due to various described mechanisms. However, when combined with other drugs that addressed its weaknesses or other aspects of the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma, it proved to be effective in reducing disease progression in a variety of advanced cases. Further investigation into the use of sorafenib in combination therapy is needed. Specifically, the combination of sorafenib with denosumab has displayed potential to be an effective future treatment for osteosarcoma.",

To begin with, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were extracted using linear models for microarray data (LIMMA) package. Then, construction of differential co-expression network (DCN) relying on DEGs was implemented, and sub-DCN was identified using Spearman correlation coefficient (SCC). Subsequently, GO annotations for OS were collected according to known confirmed database and DEGs. Ultimately, gene functions were predicted by means of GBA principle based on the area under the curve (AUC) for GO terms, and we determined GO terms with AUC >0.7 as the optimal gene functions for OS. Totally, 123 DEGs and 137 GO terms were obtained for further analysis. A DCN was constructed, which included 123 DEGs and 7503 interactions. A total of 105 GO terms were identified when the threshold was set as AUC >0.5, which had a good classification performance. Among these 105 GO terms, 2 functions had the AUC >0.7 and were determined as the optimal gene functions including angiogenesis (AUC =0.767) and regulation of immune system process (AUC =0.710). These gene functions appear to have potential for early detection and clinical treatment of OS in the future.",

In total, 60.9% of the primary tumors were located around the knee joint. The Campanacci stage of all tumors was stage 3. Surgery of the primary tumor included curettage in 37 patients, resection in 8, and amputation in 1. Local recurrence after the primary surgery occurred in 34 patients. The recurrence rate, Campanacci stage, and surgical method were significant risk factors for lung metastasis. The median postoperative metastasis times in the lower limbs, upper limbs, and axial skeleton were 20.1, 7.9, and 1.4 months, respectively (p=0.010). The median metastasis times in patients with and without recurrence were 13.7 and 43.2 months, respectively (p=0.018). Eighteen patients had unilateral metastasis and 28 had bilateral metastasis. Most lesions (n=38) were located in the peripheral lung. Nineteen patients received treatment, and 12 of them underwent tumor resection. The 5-year overall survival rate was 94.4%. This study showed that local recurrence, a high Campanacci stage, and curettage were possible high-risk factors for pulmonary metastasis. The primary lesion site and local recurrence may be related to the metastasis time. The survival rate of patients with pulmonary metastasis was high.",

Recently, a number of studies on additional fracture related risk factors, new treatment options as well as real world studies demonstrating a much higher fracture rate than suggested by randomized clinical controlled trials (RCTs). Therefore, this updated algorithm was developed to better assess fracture risk and direct treatment as a position statement of several interdisciplinary cancer and bone societies involved in the management of AI-associated bone loss (AIBL).A systematic literature review identified recent advances in the management of AIBL. Results with individual agents were assessed based on trial design, size, follow-up, and safety.Several fracture related risk factors in patients with EBC were identified. Although, the FRAX algorithm includes fracture risk factors (RF) in addition to BMD, it does not seem to adequately address the effects of AIBL. Several antiresorptive agents can prevent and treat AIBL. However, concerns regarding compliance and long-term safety remain. Overall, the evidence for fracture prevention is strongest for denosumab 60\u00a0mg\u00a0s.c. every 6 months. Additionally, recent studies as well as an individual patient data meta-analysis of all available randomized trial data support additional anticancer benefits from adjuvant bisphosphonate treatment in postmenopausal women with a 34% relative risk reduction in bone metastasis and 17% relative risk decrease in breast cancer mortality that needs to be taken into account when advising on management of AIBL.In all patients initiating AI treatment, fracture risk should be assessed and recommendation with regard to exercise and calcium/vitamin D supplementation given. Bone-directed therapy should be given to all patients with a T-score<\u22122.0 or with a T-score of <\u20131.5\u00a0SD with one additional RF, or with \u22652 risk factors (without BMD) for the duration of AI treatment. Patients with T-score>\u22121.5\u00a0SD and no risk factors should be managed based on BMD loss during the first year and the local guidelines for postmenopausal osteoporosis. Compliance should be regularly assessed as well as BMD on treatment after 12 - 24 months. Furthermore, because of the decreased incidence of bone recurrence and breast cancer specific mortality, adjuvant bisphosphonates are recommended for all postmenopausal women at significant risk of disease recurrence.",

The objective of this study is to determine the characteristics of postoperative complications after pouring liquid nitrogen into curettaged bone defects, and to review our current indications and surgical technique in bone tumor management.We reviewed charts in over 200 patients who received cryoablation for bone tumors from 1994 to 2015. Imaging studies were evaluated in all patients diagnosed with a complication. All patients receiving cryotherapy had soft tissue management intraoperatively that included warm saline directed to the structures. Liquid nitrogen was poured into the bone defect and in some cases, additional spraying with a cryogun into the defect was performed.The majority of cryotherapy was used in cases of active or aggressive benign tumors. Our low complication rate of 2.34% included 1 post-operative fracture, 3 infection, and 1 paraesthesia. Bone graft or cementation was used in the majority of patients, all of which fully incorporated.Cryoablation is an excellent from of adjuvant therapy for active and aggressive benign tumors and may be used in malignant tumors as well. Soft tissue protection is critical to avoid skin necrosis and wound breakdown. We recommend the use of cryotherapy in active and aggressive bone tumors as an adjuvant treatment prior to bone grafting or cementation.",

     "abstract": "Aromatase-inhibitors (AIs) are commonly used for treatment of patients with hormone-receptor positive breast carcinoma, and are known to induce bone density loss and increase the risk of fractures. The current standard-of-care screening tool for fracture risk is bone mineral density (BMD) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The fracture risk assessment tool (FRAX\u00ae) may be used in conjunction with BMD to identify additional osteopenic patients at risk of fracture who may benefit from a bone-modifying agent (BMA). The trabecular bone score (TBS), a novel method of measuring bone microarchitecture by DXA, has been shown to be an independent indicator of increased fracture risk. We report how the addition of TBS and FRAX\u00ae, respectively, to BMD contribute to identification of elevated fracture risk (EFR) in postmenopausal breast cancer patients treated with AIs.100 patients with early stage hormone-positive breast cancer treated with AIs, no prior BMAs, and with serial DXAs were identified. BMD and TBS were measured from DXA images before and following initiation of AIs, and FRAX\u00ae scores were calculated from review of clinical records. EFR was defined as either: BMD \u2264\u22122.5 or BMD between \u22122.5 and \u22121 plus either increased risk by FRAX\u00ae or degraded microstructure by TBS.At baseline, BMD alone identified 4% of patients with EFR. The addition of FRAX\u00ae increased detection to 13%, whereas the combination of BMD, FRAX\u00ae and TBS identified 20% of patients with EFR. Following AIs, changes in TBS were independent of changes in BMD. On follow-up DXA, BMD alone detected an additional 1 patient at EFR (1%), whereas BMD+ FRAX\u00ae identified 3 additional patients (3%), and BMD+FRAX\u00ae+TBS identified 7 additional patients (7%).The combination of FRAX\u00ae, TBS, and BMD maximized the identification of patients with EFR.

In the present study, we examined whether local delivery of BPs inhibits tumor-induced osteolysis and tumor growth more effectively than systemic treatment in an animal model of tumor-induced bone disease. Following establishment of an intra-tibial model of bone metastases in athymic mice, the experimental group was treated by local administration of zoledronate into the tibial lesion.

Moreover, patients with positive sYB-1 also had higher levels of IL-6, a known osteoclastogenic inducer. Therefore, detection of sYB-1 in patients with BC and BM may indicate a higher tumor burden, in bone and extra-bone locations, and is a biomarker of faster bone disease progression.",

     "abstract": "Many studies had demonstrated that MRI T1-weighted imaging was the most accurate method to evaluate the intramedullary extent of extremity osteosarcoma. However, we found that after neoadjuvant chemotherapy new low signal of MRI T1 imaging was detected near tumor, which mimicked the tumor progression. The aim of this study was to describe the incidence and type of this new signal, to reveal the pathological correlation with this imaging change.We included 74 extremity osteosarcomas managed between June 2011 and November 2012 in this retrospective study. The T1-weighted MRI images of the affected extremity before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were reviewed and compared. The subjects were then classified according to the appearance of the border between the area involved by osteosarcoma and the normal marrow with attention paid to whether the border was continuous and the width of the zone of transition. The study population was classified into one of four classifications: \u2018clear\u2019, \u2018continuous diffuse\u2019, \u2018discontinuous island-like\u2019 and \u2018discontinuous diffuse\u2019. 11 patients underwent MRI of bilateral extremities, and for these patients we assessed the appearance of the uninvolved extremity with that with osteosarcoma. Following surgical resection of the tumor, the pathologic appearance was compared with the pre-operative MRI findings.According to our classification system, all 74 subjects were \u2018clear\u2019 before neoadjuvant chemotherapy. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, 30 subjects (40.5%) were still clear. Of the 44 subjects (59.5%) not classified as \u2018clear\u2019, 22 (29.7%) were classified as \u2018continuous diffuse\u2019, 4 (5.4%) as \u2018discontinuous island-like\u2019, and 18 (24.3%) as \u2018discontinuous diffuse\u2019. Of the subjects with MRI of bilateral femurs, no radiologic difference was noted in the normal marrow bilaterally. No significant difference in overall survival and relapse free survival was noted between patients grouped according to the subtypes of MRI noted.Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for extremity osteosarcoma can result in a variety of changes of the MRI appearance of tumor and adjacent bone and marrow. Areas of signal change beyond the tumor that represent marrow conversion and not tumor progression appear on T1 weighted imaging to be lower in signal than subcutaneous fat and higher in signal than muscle. Recognizing the existence of the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the MR appearance of the tumor and surrounding bone and myeloid elements is important so as to plan for oncological sound tumor resections while avoiding resecting more normal bone than necessary.",

However, it is still uncertain whether denosumab is superior to zoledronic acid in delaying the time to SREs in other types of cancers, including gastrointestinal cancer, pancreas-biliary system cancer, and other rare cancers.This retrospective study was conducted based on medical records from 2009 to 2015. Eligible patients who had been diagnosed with bone metastases from gastrointestinal cancer, pancreas-biliary system cancer, and rare cancers were included. Patients were assigned to a denosumab group, zoledronic acid group, or group without bone-modifying agent treatment (no-treatment group).The study included 168 patients. The times to SREs in the denosumab, zoledronic acid, and no-treatment groups were 186 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 96\u2013323 days], 79 days (95% CI, 45\u2013118 days), and 31 days (95% CI, 13\u201376 days), respectively. Although, a few patients had grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the denosumab and zoledronic acid groups, the bone-modifying agent treatment was not terminated.From the perspective of the efficacy and safety of denosumab for delaying the time to SREs, denosumab should be used to prevent SREs in patients with bone metastases from gastrointestinal cancer, pancreas-biliary system cancer, and other rare cancers.",

The clinical PCNB data of 341 patients with bone tumors were retrospectively analyzed. The diagnostic accuracy was calculated according to the lesion components (sclerotic, parenchymatous, or cystic), benign or malignant character, and whether a soft tissue mass was present. The chi-square test was performed to assess diagnostic accuracy. The accuracy rate for sclerotic and substantive lesions was high (87.5% and 90.1%, respectively), while that for cystic lesions was the lowest. The accuracy difference in diagnosing benign and malignant lesions was significant (P<0.001). The existence of an extraskeletal soft tissue mass significantly affected the diagnostic accuracy (P=0.007). PCNB is a safe, accurate, rapid, and effective screening method in diagnosing bone tumors; however, the diagnostic accuracy for cystic lesions was poorest. The lesions without a diagnostic biopsy result were most likely to be benign, and the existence of an extraskeletal soft tissue mass significantly affected diagnostic accuracy; therefore, the correct diagnosis of skeletal system lesions still relies on the coordinated efforts of clinics, pathology, and imaging.",

Collaborative efforts to increase understanding of the biology of osteosarcoma and the use of preclinical models to test novel protein targets will be critical to identify the path toward improving outcomes for patients. We attempted to identify potential protein markers or therapy targets of osteosarcoma and give a glance at tumorigenesis of osteosarcoma. A sensitive and accurate method was employed in comparative proteomic analysis between benign tumor and osteosarcoma. Tumor tissues obtained by open biopsy before induction chemotherapy were investigated With 2D DIGE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, 22 differentially expressed proteins were identified after database searching, including 8 up-regulated and 14 down-regulated proteins. We also validated the expression levels of interesting proteins(have higher Ratios(tumor/normal)) by Western blotting assay. Annotating by bioinformatic tools, we found structural and signal transduction associated proteins were in large percentage among altered level proteins. In particular, some low abundant proteins involving translation and transcription, such as EEF2(Elongation Factor 2), LUM Lumican 23\u00a0kDa Protein) and GTF2A2(Transcription Initiation Factor Iia Gamma Chain.), were firstly reported by our study comparing to previous observations. Our findings suggest that these differential proteins may be potential biomarkers for diagnosis or molecules for understanding of osteosarcoma tumorigenesis, coming with biologic, preclinical, and clinical trial efforts being described to improve outcomes for patients.",

The Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway annotation of these differentially expressed genes showed a consistent trend in each group of samples. Totally, there were 355 differentially expressed genes occurring in all five comparison groups of different time points, in which 39 genes constructed a dysregulated TF-gene network in Ewing sarcoma cell line A673 after EWSR1/FLI1 knockdown.

This study is designed to investigate whether miR-125b levels can be used to predict the clinical response of patients with osteosarcoma (OS) to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.From January 2010 to July 2015, 82 patients with resectable OS and 56 patients with unresectable OS were enrolled. Blood samples were collected and quantitative real-time PCR was applied to determine miR-125b expression. Clinical data was collected through medical records, and patients were treated according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines on OS.Our study found that patients with low miR-125b expression had shorter disease-free survival (p<0.001) in the OS group, which was verified by Kaplan-Meier analysis and univariate and multivariate Cox analyses (p<0.001).

HRU data were extracted from hospital charts from 3.5 months before the index PF (defined as a PF preceded by a 6.5-month period without a SRE) until 3 months after the last SRE during the study period. Changes from baseline in the number and duration of inpatient stays, number of outpatient visits and number of procedures provided were recorded.Overall, 118 patients with PFs of long bones (those longer than they are wide, e.g. the femur) and 241 patients with PFs of other bones were included. Overall, HRU was greater in patients with long bone PFs than in those with PFs of other bones. A higher proportion of patients with long bone PFs had multiple SREs (79.7%), and more of their SREs were considered to be linked (73.4%) compared with patients with PFs of other bones (51.0% and 47.2%, respectively).The increased number and duration of inpatient stays for PFs of long bones compared with those for PFs of other bones may be due in part to the requirement for complicated and lengthy rehabilitation in patients with long bone PFs. Implementing strategies to delay or reduce the number of PFs experienced by patients with bone metastases or lesions may therefore reduce the associated HRU and patient burden.",

Research findings using pre-clinical mouse models have revealed that many such systemically acting factors are either secreted by or responsive to peripheral tumors and impact bone and bone marrow (collectively referred to as the bone microenvironment) to initiate processes that ultimately govern disease progression, even in the absence of detectable bone metastases. In some cases, cancer-driven modulation of the bone microenvironment involves mobilization of bone marrow hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells into the circulation that are subsequently recruited into peripheral tissues and tumors. In other cases, systemic factors alter bone marrow cell (BMC) differentiation and/or gene expression to render the BMCs pro-tumorigenic even prior to their mobilization into the circulation. Given their effect on the bone microenvironment, it stands to reason that such systemic factors might also influence metastases in the bone; however, this hypothesis remains to be comprehensively tested. Here, we briefly review what is known, and not known, about systemic factors that regulate the bone microenvironment and thereby influence bone metastases. We also pose a number of currently unanswered questions in this active area of research. A better understanding of systemic processes that influence bone metastasis should aid discovery of therapeutic approaches that aim to eradicate or reduce disease burden in the bone, which is the cause of significant patient mortality and morbidity and is currently incurable.",

Immunosuppressive M2-type TAMs have been shown to associate with poor prognosis. Throughout their life cycle, macrophages (Macs) can adapt to environmental cues and influence the surroundings by secreting different cytokines and enzymes crucial to matrix remodelling, infection fighting, immune regulation and/or inflammation. In general terms, there is a broad and complex spectrum of Mac polarization statuses from M1 (classically activated/inflammatory) to M2 (alternatively activated/wound healing/immune regulating) Macs. Often the activation status of TAMs resembles more the M2-type. Considering the physiological functions of M2 Macs, it is no surprise that TAMs appear to have a role in metastasis, participating in almost every step of the metastatic cascade, which we review and explore in selected bone tropic cancers.",

     "abstract": "The spread of breast cancer cells to bone and survival in this new metastatic environment is influenced not only by the genetic signature of the cells, but also multiple host cells and soluble factors produced locally (paracrine) or from distant sites (endocrine). Disrupting this metastatic process has been evaluated in clinical trials of the bone targeted agents bisphosphonates and denosumab and have shown that these agents reduce the recurrence of breast cancer in postmenopausal women only, suggesting the efficacy of the drugs are influenced by levels of reproductive endocrine hormones. The molecular mechanism driving this differential effect has not been definitively identified, however, there is evidence that both reproductive hormones and bisphosphonates can affect similar paracrine factors and cellular components of the bone metastatic niche. This review focuses on how the ovarian endocrine hormone, inhibin, interacts with the paracrine factors activin and follistatin, abundant in the primary tumour and bone microenvironment, with subsequent effects on tumour cell survival. Inhibin also affects the cellular components of the bone microenvironment primarily the osteoblastic niche. Recent evidence has shown that bisphosphonates also alter this niche, which may represent a common mechanism by which inhibin and bisphosphonates interact to influence disease outcomes in early breast cancer. Further research is needed to fully elucidate these molecular mechanisms to enable understanding and future development of alternative bone targeted treatments with anti-tumour efficacy in premenopausal women.",

MiR-367 was found to be an oncogene and increased in OS. However, the function of miR-367 in drug resistance in OS cells is still unknown. In this study, we found that miR-367 was up-regulated in OS tissues and OS cell cultures. Meanwhile, treatment with adriamycin (ADR) induced apoptosis of OS cells with upregulation of miR-367. Notably, KLF4 was demonstrated to be a direct target of miR-367 by gene reporter assay, and miR-367 significantly blocked both mRNA and protein level of KLF4. In addition, overexpression of miR-367 markedly suppressed the increase of KLF4 induced by ADR in OS cells, as well as Bax and cleaved caspase-3, which were significantly reversed by anti-miR-367 transfection. Taken together, our data demonstrates that miR-367 and KLF4 play important roles in OS treatment and ADR resistance, suggesting that miR-367 is a potential biomarker of chemotherapy resistance in OS and also probably a novel therapeutic target against OS.",

The primary outcome measure was the age-related rate of BIS discontinuation within 12 months after treatment initiation. Therapy discontinuation was defined as a period of at least 90 days without treatment. A multivariate Cox regression model was created to determine the influence of age on the risk of discontinuation. Health insurance coverage (private/statutory), type of care (gynecological/general), region (West/East Germany), depression, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, pain medication, antidepressants, and the number of co-medications were included as covariates.The mean ages in the group of women <70 and that of women \u226570 years of age were 55.7 (SD: 9.8) and 76.7 (SD: 5.1) years respectively. Within 12 months after treatment initiation, 44.3% of women <70 and 34.8% of women \u226570 had terminated treatment (p-value<0.001). Patients aged \u226570 were at a lower risk of treatment discontinuation than patients <70 (HR=0.78, 95% CI: 0.67\u20130.91). Furthermore, treatment in gynecological practices, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, pain medication, and number of co-medications decreased the risk of discontinuation.

We found OS tumor tissues expressed high level of protein HIF-1\u03b1, a common biological marker indicative of hypoxia. It is known that hypoxic cells are generally radioresistant because of reduced production of irradiation-induced DNA-damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the anaerobic condition. Here we report another mechanism how hypoxia induces radioresistance. In MG-63 human osteosarcoma cells, hypoxic pretreatment increased the cellular survival in irradiation. These hypoxia-exposed cells displayed compartmental recruitment of GFP-tagged LC3 and expression of protein LC3-II, and restored the radiosensitivity upon autophagy inhibition. The following immunohistochemistry of OS tumor tissue sections revealed upregulated LC3 expression in a correlation with HIF-1\u03b1 protein level, implying the possibly causative link between hypoxia and autophagy. Further studies in MG-63 cells demonstrated hypoxic pretreatment reduced cellular and mitochondrial ROS production during irradiation, while inhibition of autophagy re-elicited them. Taken together, our study suggests hypoxia can confer cells resistance to irradiation through activated autophagy to accelerate the clearance of cellular ROS products. This might exist in human osteosarcoma as an additional mechanism for radioresistance.",

Clinical trials have demonstrated that bisphosphonates reduce effectively and sustained bone pain by approved standard dosage over time. Open label prospective trials have shown that short time high dose i.v.

For reconstruction of bone and joints, allografts can be supplemented with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Similarly, adipose tissue transfer (ATT) is supplemented with adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) to improve the efficient grafting in the correction of soft tissue defects. MSC-like cells may also be used in tumor-targeted cell therapy. However, MSC may have adverse effects on sarcoma development. In the present study, human ADSCs, MSCs and pre-osteoclasts were co-injected with human MNNG-HOS osteosarcoma cells in immunodeficient mice. ADSCs and MSCs, but not the osteoclast precursors, accelerated the local proliferation of MNNG-HOS osteosarcoma cells. However, the osteolysis and the metastasis process were not exacerbated by ADSCs, MSCs, or pre-osteoclasts. In vitro proliferation of MNNG-HOS and Saos-2 osteosarcoma cells was increased up to 2-fold in the presence of ADSC-conditioned medium. In contrast, ADSC-conditioned medium did not change the dormant, quiescent state of osteosarcoma cells cultured in oncospheres. Due to the enhancing effect of ADSCs/MSCs on in vivo/in vitro proliferation of osteosarcoma cells, MSCs may not be good candidates for osteosarcoma-targeted cell therapy. Although conditioned medium of ADSCs accelerated the cell cycle of proliferating osteosarcoma cells, it did not change the quiescent state of dormant osteosarcoma cells, indicating that ADSC-secreted factors may not be involved in the risk of local recurrence.",

The present study aims to investigate the role of hypoxia in the drug resistance in osteosarcoma cells via activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling.We investigated the promotion of the resistance to doxorubicin of osteosarcoma MG-63 and U2-os cells in vitro, and then determined the role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1)\u03b1 and HIF-1\u03b2, the activation and regulatory role of AMPK in the osteosarcoma U2-os cells which were treated with doxorubicin under hypoxia.It was demonstrated that hypoxia significantly reduced the sensitivity of MG-63 and U2-os cells to doxorubicin, indicating an inhibited viability reduction and a reduced apoptosis promotion. And such reduced sensitivity was not associated with HIF-1\u03b1, though it was promoted by hypoxia in U2-os cells. Interestingly, the AMPK signaling was significantly promoted by hypoxia in the doxorubicin-treated U2-os cells, with a marked upregulation of phosphorylated AMPK (Thr 172) and phosphorylated acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (Ser 79), which were sensitive to the AMPK activator, AICAR and the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C. Moreover, the promoted AMPK activity by AICAR or the downregulated AMPK activity by Compound C significantly reduced or promoted the sensitivity of U2-os cells to doxorubicin.The present study confirmed the AMPK signaling activation in the doxorubicin-treated osteosarcoma cells, in response to hypoxia, and the chemical upregulation or downregulation of AMPK signaling reduced or increased the chemo-sensitivity of osteosarcoma U2-os cells in vitro.

The pathogenesis of osteolytic metastasis is a \u201cvicious cycle\u201d between tumor cells and bone cells (primarily the osteoclasts), which is mediated by secretory factors. The P62 adapter protein is a versatile multitasker between tumor cells and bone cells. The overexpression of P62 has been detected among a variety of tumors, playing positive roles in both tumorigenesis and metastasis. Moreover, P62 is an important modulator of the osteoclastogenesis pathway. Therefore, the ability of P62 to modulate tumors and osteoclasts suggests that it may be a feasible oncotarget for bone metastasis, especially for osteolytic metastasis. Recent research has shown that a P62 DNA vaccine triggered effective anti-tumor, anti-metastatic and anti-osteoporotic activities. Growing lines of evidence point to P62 as an emerging oncotarget for osteolytic metastasis. In this review, we outline the different roles of P62 in tumor cells and osteoclasts, focusing on the P62-related signaling pathway in key steps of osteolytic metastasis, including tumorigenesis, metastasis and osteoclastogenesis.

The change in signal from IP to OP images was measured. The reviewers' evaluation of the lesions based on T1 and T2-weighted images was compared to their evaluation with inclusion of the OP sequences.Twenty-seven lesions in bone were analyzed: 4 malignant primary bone lesions, 3 malignant soft tissue lesions to bone, 3 metastases from visceral malignancies, and 17 benign bone lesions. Benign lesions of bone dropped in signal on OP imaging by an average of 37.1%. Five of the benign lesions decreased in signal by less than 20%, and two increased. Malignant bone lesions dropped in signal by an average of 0.69% with one of the ten lesions showing a greater than 20% drop.When OP sequences were included, concern for malignancy decreased in benign lesions and increased in malignant lesions, for both the resident and attending. Compared with standard MRI, inclusion of these sequences increased the overall confidence in diagnosis for both reviewers.Opposed-phase imaging is helpful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions in bone. Confidence in diagnosis rose for both the attending and the resident as result of the inclusion of OP sequences.",

These lesions have different clinical presentation and biological behavior compared to conventional osteosarcoma, and hence need to be managed differently.The aim of this study is to analyze the clinico-pathological features and outcome of a series of surface osteosarcoma in an attempt to define the adequate treatment of this rare entity.It is a retrospective and bicentric study of 18 surface osteosarcoma that were seen at the KASSAB\u2019s Institute and SAHLOUL Hospital from 2006 to 2013. The authors reviewed the clinical and radiologic features, histologic sections, treatments, and outcomes in this group of patients.Seven patients were male (38.9%) and 11 were female (61.1%) with mean age of 25 years (range from 16 to 55 years). Eleven lesions were in the femur and 7 in the tibia. We identified 11 parosteal osteosarcoma (six of them were dedifferentiated), 3 periosteal osteosarcoma and 4 high grade surface osteosarcoma. Six patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy and all lesions had surgical resection. Margins were wide in 15 cases and intra lesional in 3 cases. Histological response to chemotherapy was poor in all cases. The mean follow up was 34.5 months. Six patients (33.3%) presented local recurrence and 8 patients (44.4%) presented lung metastases. Six patients (33.3%) died from the disease after a mean follow up of 12 months (6\u201330 months); all of them had high grade lesions.Histological grade of malignancy is the main point to assess in surface osteosarcoma since it determines treatment and prognosis. Low grade lesions should be treated by wide resection, while high grade lesions need more aggressive surgical approach associated to post operative chemotherapy.",

     "abstract": "Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) is an essential mediator of osteoclast formation, function and survival. In patients with solid tumor metastasis to the bone, targeting the bone microenvironment by inhibition of RANKL using denosumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) specific to RANKL, has been demonstrated to prevent tumor-induced osteolysis and subsequent skeletal complications. Recently, a prominent functional role for the RANKL pathway has emerged in the primary bone tumor giant cell tumor of bone (GCTB). Expression of both RANKL and RANK is extremely high in GCTB tumors and denosumab treatment was associated with tumor regression and reduced tumor-associated bone lysis in GCTB patients. In order to address the potential role of the RANKL pathway in another primary bone tumor, this study assessed human RANKL and RANK expression in human primary osteosarcoma (OS) using specific mAbs, validated and optimized for immunohistochemistry (IHC) or flow cytometry.Our results demonstrate RANKL expression was observed in the tumor element in 68% of human OS using IHC. However, the staining intensity was relatively low and only 37% (29/79) of samples exhibited\u226510% RANKL positive tumor cells. RANK expression was not observed in OS tumor cells. In contrast, RANK expression was clearly observed in other cells within OS samples, including the myeloid osteoclast precursor compartment, osteoclasts and in giant osteoclast cells. The intensity and frequency of RANKL and RANK staining in OS samples were substantially less than that observed in GCTB samples. The observation that RANKL is expressed in OS cells themselves suggests that these tumors may mediate an osteoclastic response, and anti-RANKL therapy may potentially be protective against bone pathologies in OS. However, the absence of RANK expression in primary human OS cells suggests that any autocrine RANKL/RANK signaling in human OS tumor cells is not operative, and anti-RANKL therapy would not directly affect the tumor.",

Paired histopathology specimens from 33 of these patients were used for immunohistochemistry (IHC) to correlate CT with IMP-3 expression. IMP-3 gene expression studies were performed on RCC and poorly vascular prostate cancer (PC) human bone metastases samples to confirm presence of IMP3 in metastatic samples from RCC.

     "abstract": "The prognosis of patients with metastatic osteosarcoma remains poor. However, the chance of survival can be improved by surgical resection of all metastases. In this study we investigate the value of serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in predicting the presence of metastatic disease at time of diagnosis.Sixty-one patients with histologically confirmed conventional osteosarcoma of the extremity were included in the study. Only 19.7% of cases presented without evidence of systemic spread of the disease. Pre-treatment serum ALP and LDH were analysed in patients with and without skeletal or pulmonary metastases.Serum LDH and ALP levels were not significantly different in patients with or without pulmonary metastases (p=0.88 and p=0.47, respectively). The serum LDH and ALP levels did however differ significantly in patients with or without skeletal metastases (p<0.001 and p=0.02, respectively). The optimal breakpoint for serum LDH as a marker of skeletal metastases was 849 IU/L (AUC 0.839; Sensitivity=0.88; Specificity=0.73). LDH >454 IU/L equated to 100% sensitivity for detected bone metastases (positive diagnostic likelihood ratio (DLR)=1.32). With a cut-off of 76 IU/L a sensitivity of 100% was reached for serum ALP predicting the presence of skeletal metastases (positive DLR=1.1). In a multivariate analysis both LDH \u2265850 IU/L (odds ratio [OR]=9; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8\u201344.3) and ALP \u2265280 IU/L (OR=10.3; 95% CI 2.1\u201350.5) were predictive of skeletal metastases. LDH however lost its significance in a multivariate model which included pre-treatment tumour volume.In cases of osteosarcoma with LDH >850 IU/L and/or ALP >280 IU/L it may be prudent to consider more sensitive staging investigations for detection of skeletal metastases. Further research is required to determine the value and the most sensitive cut-off points of serum ALP and LDH in the prediction of skeletal metastases.",

As the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates osteoclast activity and is associated with more extensive bone metastases and SRE risk in metastatic breast cancer, we hypothesized that blockade of VEGF signaling could be a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting bone metastases progression and possibly prolonging overall (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). The Zamboney trial was a randomized placebo-controlled study designed to assess whether patients with bone predominant metastatic breast cancer benefited from addition of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) targeting agent, vandetanib, to endocrine therapy with fulvestrant. As a companion study, evaluation of biomarkers and their potential association with response to vandetanib or SRE risk was performed.Baseline overnight fasted serum from enrolled patients was analyzed for levels of various putative biomarkers including; VEGF-A, soluble (s)VEGFR2, sVEGFR3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 and activinA by ELISA. Spearman correlation coefficients and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to investigate potential relationships between biomarker values and baseline clinical parameters. Prognostic and predictive ability of each marker was investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustments for treatment and baseline strata of serum CTx (<400 versus \u2265400\u00a0ng/L).Of 129 enrolled patients, serum was available for analysis in 101; 51 in vandetanib and 50 in placebo arm. Mean age amongst consenting patients was 59.8 years. Clinical characteristics were not significantly different between patients with or without serum biomarker data and serum markers were similar for patients by treatment arm. Baseline sVEGFR2 was prognostic for OS (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.61\u20130.96, p=0.020), and although a modest association was observed, it was not significant for PFS (HR=0.90, 95% CI=0.80\u20131.01, p=0.085) nor time to first SRE (HR=0.82, 95% CI=0.66\u20131.02, p=0.079). When interaction terms were evaluated, sVEGFR2 was not found to be predictive of response to vandetanib, although a modest association remained with respect to PFS (interaction p=0.085). No other marker showed any significant prognostic or predictive ability with any measured outcome.In this clinical trial, sVEGFR2 appeared prognostic for OS, hence validation of sVEGFR2 should be conducted.

     "abstract": "In bone metastases, the disruption of normal bone processes results in increased resorption and formation rates, which can often be quantitatively measured by biomarkers in the urine and blood. The purpose of this review is to summarize relevant studies of urinary markers used as a diagnostic and/or prognostic tool, as well as its potential and advances in directing therapy.A literature search was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE (1950 to July 2014), EMBASE (1950 to 2014 week 30) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (3rd Quarter 2014) to identify studies that detailed the use of urinary markers in the cancer setting, specifically involving markers for bone metastases. Search terms included \u201curinary markers\u201d, \u201ccancer\u201d, and \u201cbone metastases\u201d.A total of 35 articles, with 24 original studies, were identified. In general, urinary markers can be used to detect early signs of bone metastases prior to skeletal imaging, but still must be used in conjunction with imaging to avoid false positive results. The use of urinary markers, such as N-telopeptide, as a prognostic tool remains controversial, but can provide information on the relative risk of skeletal related events (SREs), disease progression, as well as death. Finally, while urinary markers have shown to be potentially useful in confirming the efficacy of bone metastases treatments, exploring the appropriate dosages for treatment, and directing therapy, it is still unclear to what extent urinary markers should be reduced by.The potential use of urinary markers in the management of bone metastases is promising as it can allow for earlier and more convenient detection of bone metastases in comparison to other techniques. However, additional studies involving prospective clinical trials are suggested to further examine the potential of urinary markers in developing appropriate treatment strategies and endpoints, especially in developing a clearer protocol on the extent urinary markers should be reduced by to correlate with achievement of clinical benefit.",

Approximately half of NB patients manifest bone metastasis accompanied with bone pain, fractures and bone marrow failure, leading to disturbed quality of life and poor survival. To study the mechanism of bone metastasis of NB, we established an animal model in which intracardiac inoculation of the SK-N-AS human NB cells in nude mice developed osteolytic bone metastases with increased osteoclastogenesis. SK-N-AS cells induced the expression of receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand and osteoclastogenesis in mouse bone marrow cells in the co-culture. SK-N-AS cells expressed COX-2 mRNA and produced substantial amounts of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). In contrast, the SK-N-DZ and SK-N-FI human NB cells failed to develop bone metastases, induce osteoclastogenesis, express COX-2 mRNA and produce PGE2. Immunohistochemical examination of SK-N-AS bone metastasis and subcutaneous tumor showed strong expression of COX-2. The selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 inhibited PGE2 production and suppressed bone metastases with reduced osteoclastogenesis. NS-398 also inhibited subcutaneous SK-N-AS tumor development with decreased angiogenesis and vascular endothelial growth factor-A expression. Of interest, metastasis to the adrenal gland, a preferential site for NB development, was also diminished by NS-398. Our results suggest that COX2/PGE2 axis plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of osteolytic bone metastases and tumor development of the SK-NS-AS human NB. Inhibition of angiogenesis by suppressing COX-2/PGE2 may be an effective therapeutic approach for children with NB.",

Inclusion criteria were primary studies published with full text and/or abstracts only. Letters to the editor were excluded.A total of 11 studies were selected, two of which were abstracts published by ASTRO in 2014. Seven articles investigated pain flare and/or dexamethasone use for conventional external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) while the remaining four investigated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). Pain flare incidence ranged from 2 to 44% for EBRT and 10 to 68% in SBRT. The use of dexamethasone also showed to be effective in both the prophylaxis and treatment of pain flare.Pain flare has been established as an acute toxicity of both EBRT and SBRT, although its incidence is widely variable due to differences in data collection. The use of dexamethasone in the prophylaxis of pain flare is efficacious. Future studies are required in order to both optimize the reporting of pain and the dexamethasone regimens in the prevention of pain flare.",

Several randomized control trials and meta-analyses have concluded a similar efficacy in pain relief when comparing single versus multiple fraction regimes. However, there continues to be reluctance to conform to published guidelines that recommend a single treatment for the palliation of painful bone metastases.

The use of single fraction radiotherapy (SFRT) ranged from 3% to 75%, but was generally lower in American studies. Choice of fractionation depended on a variety of factors, including patient age, prognosis, site of irradiation, and physician experience. Conclusion: Despite the publication of robust randomized control trials, meta-analyses, and clinical practice guidelines recommending the use of a single treatment to palliate uncomplicated bone metastasis, SFRT is internationally underutilized.",

     "abstract": "Bone metastases represent common long term complications of patients with breast cancer. Zoledronic acid, an amino-bisphosphonate and mevalonate pathway inhibitor, is an established agent for the treatment of bone metastases. Direct antitumor effects of zoledronic acid have been proposed in breast cancer. Statins are another group of mevalonate pathway inhibitors that have been repeatedly discussed for potential anti-tumor activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis, whether these agents regulate adhesion of breast cancer cells to extracellular matrix components. Treatment of breast cancer cells with zoledronic acid and atorvastatin, significantly impaired MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell adhesion on the \u03b1v\u03b23 ligands gelatin and vitronectin, but had no effect on collagen type 1 (\u03b12\u03b21-ligand) and fibronectin (\u03b15\u03b21-ligand). Anti-adhesive effects of zoledronic acid were fully reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP). Furthermore, effects of zoledronic acid and atorvastatin were mimicked by a specific inhibitor of geranylgeranylation GGTI-298. Functional (using integrin array) and quantitative (using FACS) integrin analyses on MDA-231 cells following zoledronic acid exposure revealed decreased levels of \u03b1v and \u03b1v\u03b23 expression. In addition to its effects on integrin mediated adhesion of breast cancer cells, the presence of zoledronic acid caused pronounced morphological changes in MDA-231 cells as seen by F-actin and vinculin rearrangement. Furthermore, phosphorylation of the focal adhesion kinase was inhibited by zoledronic acid. In both cases, changes were fully reversed by GGPP. These results emphasize the role of mevalonate pathway mediated impairment of geranylgeranylation in the anti-adhesive effects of zoledronic acid in breast cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer often metastasizes into bone and leads to osteolytic lesions. The underlying mechanisms, however, are complex and not fully understood. Syndecan-1 is a proteoglycan that has various functions relevant for tumor progression including cell\u2013cell communication and cell\u2013matrix interactions. Moreover, its two glycosaminoglycan-binding sites suggest that it may interfere with glycoproteins such as osteoprotegerin, a potent inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis. Thus, we hypothesize that tumor-derived syndecan-1 alters osteoclast biology by modulating osteoprotegerin.Syndecan-1 expression was down-regulated via siRNA and the cell fate of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7, T-47D, and MDA-MB-231 was investigated. Furthermore, we determined the regulation of syndecan-1 by dexamethasone, a commonly used antiemetic in breast cancer therapy. Additionally, we analyzed the genesis and activity of osteoclasts in indirect co-culture experiments using supernatants from MCF-7 cells with deficient and sufficient levels of syndecan-1.Dexamethasone time- and dose-dependently increased syndecan-1 expression up to 4-fold but did not alter cell behavior. Syndecan-1 up-regulation did not affect the survival or migration of breast cancer cells. Depletion of syndecan-1 using siRNA led to decreased vitality of progesterone receptor-positive cell lines. In MCF-7 cells osteoprotegerin production was up-regulated 2.5-fold after syndecan-1 knock-down. The culture of osteoclast precursors with the supernatant of MCF-7 cells with reduced syndecan-1 levels suppressed osteoclast formation and activity by 21% and 23%, respectively. Adding neutralizing antibodies to osteoprotegerin to the breast cancer supernatants reversed osteoclastogenesis.Thus, we identified tumor-derived syndecan-1 as a novel positive regulator of osteoclastogenesis and new player in the tumor-bone dialog.",

Overall, 26.8% of all SREs were clinically asymptomatic. Within the entire cohort, 51% required opioids and 20% were hospitalized due to either an SRE or bone pain.Despite extensive use of bone-targeted agents, the incidence of SREs remains high. Nearly half of SREs occur prior to starting a bone-targeted agent. Use of opioids and hospitalizations secondary to bone metastases remain common. More effective treatment options are clearly needed.",

Three hundred and three postmenopausal women with early breast cancer (EBC) were enrolled (osteoporotic, n=25; osteopaenic, n=146; normal bone mineral density (BMD), n=126). Weekly alendronate (70\u00a0mg) treatment efficacy as triggered by the algorithm in preventing bone loss was evaluated.

Eleven out of the 146 (7.5%) osteopaenic patients commenced alendronate within 18 months of participation and eleven commenced after. One hundred and twenty four out of the 146 (84.9%) osteopaenic patients and all 126 with normal baseline BMD did not trigger the algorithm.At three years, lumbar spine mean BMD increased (15.6%, p<0.01) in the osteoporotic group. BMD in the osteopaenic group with early intervention significantly increased at three years (6.3%, p=0.02). No significant change was seen in the late intervention group. No change was observed in those with osteopaenia without alendronate.There was a significant drop in lumbar spine (\u22125.4%) and hip (\u22124.5%) mean BMD, in the normal BMD group, none of whom received alendronate.Fracture data will be presented.In postmenopausal women with endocrine-responsive EBC, BMD improved over time when a bisphosphonate is administered with anastrozole in osteoporotic patients using an osteoporosis schedule. Subjects with normal baseline BMD experienced the greatest BMD loss, although none became osteoporotic.",

Although an increasing number of therapies are available for treatment of bone metastasis, this remains incurable, highlighting the need for better understanding of the underlying biology. Metastatic tumour spread to distant organs is a multistage process, involving not only cancer cells but also those of the surrounding host microenvironment. Tumour associated macrophages are multifunctional cells that contribute both to tumour development and response to treatment by regulating adaptive immunity, remodelling of stroma, mediating basement membrane breakdown and angiogenesis. Although direct evidence for a specific role of macrophages in bone metastasis is limited, their involvement in metastasis in general is well documented. In this review we provide an overview of role of macrophages in tumour progression, with particular emphasis on their potential role in bone metastasis.",

The development of multi-disciplinary therapy has increased current long-term survival rates to greater than 50% but only 20% for high risk group patients (relapse, metastases, etc.). Among new therapeutic approaches, osteoprotegerin (OPG), an anti-bone resorption molecule may represent a promising candidate to inhibit RANKL-mediated osteolytic component of ES and consequently to limit the tumor development.Xenogenic orthotopic models of Ewing's sarcoma were induced by intra-osseous injection of human TC-71 ES cells. OPG was administered in vivo by non-viral gene transfer using an amphiphilic non ionic block copolymer. ES bearing mice were assigned to controls (no treatment, synthetic vector alone or F68/empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid) and hOPG treated groups. A substantial but not significant inhibition of tumor development was observed in the hOPG group as compared to control groups. Marked bone lesions were revealed by micro-computed tomography analyses in control groups whereas a normal bone micro-architecture was preserved in the hOPG treated group. RANKL over-expressed in ES animal model was expressed by tumor cells rather than by host cells. However, TRAIL present in the tumor microenvironment may interfere with OPG effect on tumor development and bone remodeling via RANKL inhibition.In conclusion, the use of a xenogenic model of Ewing's sarcoma allowed discriminating between the tumor and host cells responsible for the elevation of RANKL production observed in this tumor and demonstrated the relevance of blocking RANKL by OPG as a promising therapy in ES.",

Statistical analysis of respondent data was performed to establish relevant proportions of patient responses.Responses were received from 141 patients, 76 (53.9%) with prostate cancer and 65 (46.1%) with breast cancer. Duration of BTA use was <3 months (15.9%) to >24 months (35.2%). Patients were uncertain how long they would remain on a BTA. While most felt their BTA was given to reduce the chance of bone fractures (77%), 52% thought it would slow tumour growth. Prostate patients were more likely to receive denosumab and breast cancer patients, pamidronate. There was more variability in the dosing interval for breast cancer patients. Given a choice, most patients (49\u201357%) would prefer injection therapy to oral therapy (21\u201323%).

     "abstract": "Aminobisphosphonates are used for the treatment of benign and malignant bone disorders. As inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway they exert direct anti-tumor effects in vitro and in preclinical models of bone metastases. Bisphosphonates are thought to have an anti-angiogenic activity as decreased levels of VEGF have been reported in some, although not all patients, following treatment with bisphosphonates. Direct effects of bisphosphonates on tumor derived VEGF have not been examined in detail. We therefore investigated VEGF expression in breast cancer cell lines following mevalonate pathway inhibition. Treatment of cell lines with increasing doses of zoledronic acid and atorvastatin resulted in increased levels of VEGF production. Similar results were seen with the geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor GGTI-298. The induction of VEGF was reversed by the supplementation of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not by farnesyl pyrophosphate indicating that this effect is mediated by inhibited geranylgeranylation. Previous reports have reported decreased VEGF levels in patients following BP treatment in vivo. We assessed VEGF levels in patients with non-metastatic breast cancer following repeated treatment with zoledronic acid. In contrast to our in vitro findings, VEGF serum levels decreased in all patients after 6\u20139 months of treatment (by an average of 41%) as assessed in a small pilot trial. These results indicate that tissues other than breast tumors contribute to the serum pool of circulating VEGF and may be responsible for the observed VEGF decreases. The increases of VEGF in the cancer cells may provide a rationale for the combined treatment with VEGF inhibitors.",

At this stage of disease treatment is palliative, but tumor-targeted compounds could add to the benefits of anti-resorptive agents, improving clinical outcome. Inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs) are overexpressed in many tumors and second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) mimetics have been designed to antagonize IAPs. In this work we explored the use of AT-406, a Smac mimetic, to target the tumor compartment of bone metastases.Effect of AT-406 on cancer cells apoptosis, expression of IAPs and osteogenic potential was addressed in vitro using the RANK-positive MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line. Effect of AT-406 on osteoclastogenesis was determined by inducing the differentiation of the RAW 264.7 mouse monocytic cell line. Osteoclastogenesis was measured by TRAP staining and TRACP 5b quantification.AT-406 increased apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in vitro, and activation of RANK-pathway improved this effect. RANKL stimuli induced a strong increase in c-IAP2. AT-406 increased osteoclast differentiation and activity, by up-regulating the osteogenic transcription factor Nfatc1, but also increased the apoptosis of mature osteoclasts in the absence of RANKL.Our results indicate that despite the anti-tumoral effect of AT-406, its use in the context of bone metastatic disease needs to be carefully monitored for the induction of increased bone resorption. We also hypothesize that the combination of AT-406 with anti-RANKL directed therapies could have a beneficial effect, especially in RANK-positive tumors.",

Interactions within the bone marrow microenvironment in myeloma are responsible for the abnormal bone remodeling in myeloma bone disease. Myeloma cells drive bone destruction that increases tumor growth, directly stimulates the OCL formation, and induces cells in the marrow microenvironment to produce factors that drive OCL formation and suppress OBL formation. Factors produced by marrow stromal cells and OCL promote tumor growth through direct action on myeloma cells and by increasing angiogenesis. Current therapies targeting MMBD focus on preventing osteoclastic bone destruction; however regulators of OBL inhibition in MMBD have also been identified, and targeted agents with a potential anabolic effect in MMBD are under investigation.

     "abstract": "Osteosarcoma (OS) is a bone malignancy that affects children and adolescents. It is a highly aggressive tumor and typically metastasizes to lungs. Despite aggressive chemotherapy and surgical treatments, the current 5 year survival rate is 60\u201370%. Clinically relevant models are needed to understand OS pathobiology, metastatic progression from bones to lungs, and ultimately, to develop more efficacious treatment strategies and improve survival rates in OS patients with metastasis. The main goal of this study was to develop and characterize an in vivo OS model that will allow non-invasive tracking of tumor progression in real time, and aid in studying OS pathobiology, and screening of potential therapeutic agents against OS. In this study, we have used a multi-modality approach using bioluminescent imaging, electron microscopy, micro-computed tomography, and histopathology to develop and characterize a preclinical Bioluminescent Osteosarcoma Orthotopic Mouse (BOOM) model, using 143B human OS cell line. The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the BOOM model represents the clinical disease as evidenced by a spectrum of changes associated with tumor establishment, progression and metastasis, and detection of known OS biomarkers in the primary and metastatic tumor tissue. Key novel findings of this study include: (a) multimodality approach for extensive characterization of the BOOM model using 143B human OS cell line; (b) evidence of renal metastasis in OS orthotopic model using 143B cells; (c) evidence of Runx2 expression in the metastatic lung tissue; and (d) evidence of the presence of extracellular membrane vesicles and myofibroblasts in the BOOM model.",

Despite some potential positive effects of bone-targeted therapies, their use in NSCLC is infrequent, which may relate to the overall poor prognosis of advanced lung cancer. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the incidence, consequences and use of bone-targeting agents in lung cancer patients with BM in both the trial and non-trial clinical setting.Published prospective and retrospective papers investigating lung cancer and BM, in trial and non-trial settings, were identified and are discussed in this review.BM are common in patients with advanced lung cancer and often present symptomatically with pain and skeletal related events (SREs). Patients with high bone turnover marker levels, multiple BM, and history of pathological fractures have shorter overall survival. In randomized studies bone-targeted therapies reduced the risk of SREs and prolonged the time to first SRE. The use of bone-targeted agents may also be associated with a survival benefit.BM are a common problem in advanced lung cancer. While the benefits of bone-targeted therapies have been demonstrated, their use is limited in non-trial populations. If better predictive markers of individual risk were available this might increase the appropriate use of bone-targeted agents.",

There has, however been increasing concern about the oral health of these patients and in particular osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), especially with the increasing use of these agents at higher potencies for greater periods of time.A review of the published data in PubMed and meeting abstracts was performed to examine incidence, risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical course and management of osteonecrosis of the jaw with focus on cancer patients treated with bone-targeted agents (BTA) for bone metastases. This manuscript takes the most frequent and pertinent questions raised by oncologists, dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons and tries to give a pragmatic overview of the literature.The incidence of ONJ varies depending on types of bone-targeted agents, duration of treatment and additional risk factors. The causes and pathogenesis of ONJ is not fully elucidated, however bone-targeted therapy induced impaired bone remodelling, microtrauma secondary to jaw activity, and oral bacterial infection seem to be important factors. Since the treatment options for ONJ are limited and not well established, preventive strategies have to be included in patients management.Many unanswered questions remain about the optimal oral care of patients receiving bone-targeted agents. Prospective data collection will remedy this and help to provide practical guidelines for the management and treatment of those patients that require dental intervention.",

Despite widespread use, relatively little is known about the in vivo effect of these agents on bone homeostasis, bone quality, and bone architecture in humans. Traditionally bone quality has been assessed using a transiliac bone biopsy with a 7\u00a0mm \u201cBordier\u201d core needle. We examined the possibility of using a 2\u00a0mm \u201cJamshidi\u201d core needle as a more practical and less invasive method to assess bone turnover and potentially other tumor effects.A pilot study on the feasibility of assessing bone quality and microarchitecture and tumor invasion using a 2\u00a0mm bone marrow trephine was conducted. Patients underwent a posterior trans-iliac trephine biopsy and bone marrow aspirate. Samples were analyzed for bone microarchitecture, bone density, and histomorphometry. The study plan was to accrue three patients with advanced breast cancer to assess the feasibility of the study before enrolling more patients.The procedure was well tolerated. The sample quality was excellent to analyze bone trabecular microarchitecture using both microCT and histomorphometry. Intense osteoclastic activity was observed in a patient with extensive tumor burden in bone despite intravenous bisphosphonate therapy.Given the success of this study for assessing bone microarchitecture, bone density, and histomorphometry assessment using a 2\u00a0mm needle the study will be expanded beyond these initial three patients for longitudinal assessment of bone-targeted therapy.",

The definition of an SRE has evolved over the years and now excludes hypercalcemia of malignancy due to its low incidence. The purpose of this review was to investigate if advances in bone-targeted therapies have decreased skeletal morbidity rates (SMR) over time.A literature search was conducted in several databases to identify phase III results from bone-targeted therapy trials from 1980 through September 2011. Graphs were created to document the trends of the natural log of SMR over the mean time of enrolment for all placebo and intervention arms. Statistical hypothesis testing was employed to account for confounding factors.A total of 14 studies were identified which reported the SMR from phase III trials from 1990 to 2007. A statistically significant downward trend was observed in the placebo arms of trials over time; a similar trend was seen in all intervention arms. In a direct comparison of intervention against placebo arms, it was found that there was a significant decreasing time trend (p<0.0001) and a significant departure in SMR from placebo to intervention arms (p=0.0348). These results were seen even after accounting for the confounding factors of histology and differences in drugs.The decrease in SMR over time may not only be a result of advancements with bone targeted agents, but also due to better management and awareness of events associated with bone metastases.",

We performed an open-label, prospective study in patients treated with zoledronic acid who developed ONJ lesions >2.5\u00a0cm, and had no benefit after the treatment with the standard therapy, to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of medical ozone (O3) treatment delivered as gas insufflations on each ONJ lesions.Twenty-four patients (mean age 62.5, range 41\u201380; 12 female) with bone metastases due to breast (11), prostate (4)and lung (4)cancers, myeloma (2), or osteoporosis (3), previously treated with zoledronic acid and not underwent dental preventive measures and with ONJ lesions >2.5\u00a0cm, were observed and treated with topical O3 gas insufflation every third day for a minimum of 10 for each pathological area or till necrotic bone sequestrum or surgery. We used a special insufflation bell-shaped device adjusted to the specific characteristics of the patient, capable of eliminating any residue of O3 diffusion by degrading it and releasing O2 into the air. Azithromicin 500\u00a0mg/day was administered for 10 days in all patients before the first three gas insufflation although they had previously received various cycles of antibiotics. Ten patients required more than 10 O3 gas insufflations due to multiple lesions and/or purulent sovrainfections; one patient received two further O3 insufflations while waiting the day of surgery. Six of 24 patients interrupted the O3 gas therapy for oncological disease progression (five patients) and for fear of an experimental therapy (one patient). Six patients had the sequestrum and complete or partial (one patient) spontaneous expulsion of the necrotic bone followed by oral mucosa re-epithelization after a range of 4\u201327 of O3 gas insufflations. No patient reported adverse events. In 12 patients with the largest and deeper ONJ lesions, O3 gas therapy produced the sequestrum of the necrotic bone after 10 to 38 insufflations; surgery was necessary to remove it (11 patients). Of interest, removal was possible without the resection of healthy mandible edge because of the presence of bone sequestrum.All together the response rate was 75.0% (95% CI, 53.3\u201390.2%) in ITT analysis and 100% (95% CI, 81.5\u2013100%) in the PP analysis.In all patients treated with O3 gas \u00b1 surgery, no ONJ relapse appeared (follow-up mean 18 months, range 1\u20133 years).

Secondary assessments: skeletal-related event (SRE) rate, pain, quality of life (QoL), and prostate-specific antigen levels. Endpoints were assessed using summary statistics by visit/tumor type and Kaplan\u2013Meier analyses.ZOL treatment significantly decreased bone-marker levels (amino-terminal propeptide of type I collagen [P1NP], C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen [CTX]; P<0.0001), and this decrease was maintained through the final 1-year follow-up visit. Baseline P1NP and CTX levels correlated with extent of bone disease (P<0.0001, each) and on-treatment decreases in marker levels. Skeletal disease burden and bone-marker levels were similar between PC and BC patients, and ZOL did not significantly influence osteoprotegerin/receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand levels. Only 13 SREs occurred in 11 patients, supporting the known ZOL-mediated reduction in SREs. On-treatment bone-marker level changes did not correlate with SRE rate, pain scores, or QoL. Generally, ZOL was well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with its known safety profile.This study confirms that ZOL therapy significantly reduces bone turnover (measured as P1NP and CTX levels) in patients with bone metastases from PC or BC.",

We used available North American and Canadian cancer trial websites and also contacted known investigators in this field for their input.Twenty seven clinical trials were identified. Seven pertained to local treatment of bone metastasis from any solid tumour type. Seven were systemic treatment trials, five focused on bone biology and predictive factors, three evaluated safety of bone-targeted agents, three were adjuvant trials and two trials investigated impact of cancer therapy on bone health. The majority of trials were related to systemic treatment and bone biology in breast cancer. Most were small, single centre, grant-funded studies. Not surprisingly the larger safety and adjuvant studies were pharmaceutical company driven.Despite the widespread interest in bone-targeted therapies our survey would suggest that most studies are single centre and breast cancer focused. If major advances in bone oncology are to be made then collaborative strategies are needed to not only increase current sample sizes but to also expand these studies into non-breast cancer populations.",

Thus, we examined the combined effects of Zol and an EGF receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib, on the proliferation and invasion of a bone-seeking clone and the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Combined treatment with Zol and gefitinib synergistically inhibited both invasion and cell proliferation of the bone-seeking clone, but not those of the MDA-MB-231 cells. Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry demonstrated that stathmin was down-regulated during these cooperative effects. Stathmin is a signal transduction regulatory factor which plays an important role in cell division and malignant tumor development.

X-ray imaging as well as CT and MRI scans before and after treatment was carried out. After detecting bone tumor, radiofrequency ablation was performed. The ablation instrument contained a 10\u00a0g bipolar, articulated extendable electrode and a proprietary generator with an impedance controlled algorithm. All bones and the soft tissue were examined histologically.All animals developed local bone tumor. Mean duration until first osteolytic lesions on CT-scans was 48\u00b114 days. The mean lesion area was 26\u00a0mm2. No systemic tumor spread was seen. 6 radiofrequency procedures were carried out with a mean application time of 6\u00a0min\u00b12:30 and an average temperature in the region of effect of 55\u00a0\u00b0C\u00b14. MRI imaging demonstrated an ablation zone of 23\u00b16\u00a0mm around the electrode. Histopathology showed an extensive heat necrosis with no remaining tumor cells in the ablation area.Radiofrequency ablation is a quickly developing treatment option on the field of minimal invasive bone tumor therapy. The electrode enables an ablation adapted to size and shape of the metastases. Further clinical studies are necessary to test and enhance this radiofrequency system.",

     "abstract": "Bone remodelling is related to coordinated phases of bone resorption and bone apposition allowing the maintenance of bone integrity, the phosphocalcic homoeostasis all along the life and consequently the bone adaptation to mechanical constraints or/and to endocrine fluctuations. Unfortunately, bone is a frequent site of tumour development originated from bone cell lineages (primary bone tumours: bone sarcomas) or from nonosseous origins (bone metastases: carcinomas). These tumour cells disrupt the balance between osteoblast and osteoclast activities resulting in a disturbed bone remodelling weakening the bone tissue, in a strongly altered bone microenvironment and consequently facilitating the tumour growth. At the early stage of tumour development, osteoclast differentiation and recruitment of mature osteoclasts are strongly activated resulting in a strong bone matrix degradation and release of numerous growth factors initially stored into this organic/calcified matrix. In turn these soluble factors stimulate the proliferation of tumour cells and exacerbate their migration and their ability to initiate metastases. Because Receptor Activator of NF\u03baB Ligand (RANKL) is absolutely required for in vivo osteoclastogenesis, its role in the bone tumour growth has been immediately pointed out and has consequently allowed the development of new targeted therapies of these malignant diseases. The present review summarises the role of RANKL in the bone tumour microenvironment, the most recent pre-clinical and clinical evidences of its targeting in bone metastases and bone sarcomas. The following sections position RANKL targeted therapy among the other anti-resorptive therapies available and underline the future directions which are currently under investigations.",

     "abstract": "Bisphosphonates have demonstrated anti-tumour activity in preclinical studies of bone metastatic disease, thus it was natural to transition these agents into the adjuvant cancer therapy setting. Surprisingly, the results of adjuvant breast cancer trials have shown either modest to no benefit or even harm. We sought to explore whether the preclinical results supporting bisphosphonate use provided clues to help explain the current clinical data. Interestingly, the majority of preclinical data suggested that bisphosphonate treatment was more efficacious when administered after the establishment of osseous metastases. This is similar to the findings of one clinical study whereby patients with biopsy evidence of osseous micrometastases derive greater survival benefit from bisphosphonate treatment. Another clinical study found bisphosphonates were associated with increased incidence of visceral metastases, similar to what has been previously published in preclinical models using \u201cpreventative\u201d dosing strategies. While the current clinical data suggest bisphosphonates may be more efficacious in post-menopausal or oestrogen depleted patients, or those with hormone receptor positive tumours, to date no appropriately designed preclinical studies have evaluated these effects. Furthermore, putative mechanisms that regulate response to bisphosphonates in other tumour types remain to be evaluated in breast cancer. Despite the initial optimism regarding adjuvant bisphosphonate therapy, the conflicting clinical results from large trials suggest that we should return to the bench to further investigate factors that may influence response to bisphosphonate treatment or identify appropriate characteristics that would indicate the sub-groups of patients most likely to benefit from bisphosphonate treatment.",

     "abstract": "Bone metastases are a common manifestation of malignancy, and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) effectively and safely palliates the pain caused by this clinical circumstance. The myriad of EBRT dosing schemes and complexities involved with coordinating radiotherapy with other interventions necessitated the need for bone metastases treatment guidelines. Here we compare and contrast the bone metastases radiotherapy treatment guidelines recently published by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American College of Radiology (ACR). These evaluations acknowledge current controversies in treatment approaches, they evaluate the nuances of ASTRO and ACR task force decision-making regarding standard approaches to care, and they project the upcoming research results that may clarify approaches to palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases. The results of these two dedicated radiotherapy guidelines are compared to the brief mentions of radiotherapy for bone metastases in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines. Finally, the paper describes how treatment guidelines may influence patterns of care and reimbursement by their use as quality measures by groups such as the National Quality Forum (NQF).",

     "abstract": "To evaluate bone density changes at the level of normal bone and bone metastases after zoledronic acid (ZA) treatment in oncologic patients.We retrospectively evaluated 72 consecutive adult patients with histologically confirmed solid tumors with at least 1 newly diagnosed bone metastatic lesion. Bone metastases were diagnosed by bone scans and confirmed with computed tomography (CT). Patients received intravenous ZA, 4\u00a0mg, by 15-min infusion every 28 day through a peripheral or a central venous access and were monitored for at least 3 months and a maximum of 24 months. Bone density was determined at the level of bone metastases and at the level of normal trabecular and cortical bone using a ROI-based approach.A significant increase was demonstrated at the level of normal trabecular bone of the calvarium and the femoral neck. No significant increase of density was observed at the level of the normal cortical bone. Bone metastases showed a significant increase in CT density as compared to baseline up to 24 months after zoledronic acid.We have found that long term treatment with ZA increases trabecular bone density in oncologic patients whereas normal cortical bone changes are not detectable.",
