     "abstract": "Cytogenetic and related changes in human cancer constitute part of a constantly developing and enlarging continuum of known genetic alterations associated with cancer development and biology. The cytogenetic component of this continuum has fulfilled much of its pioneering role and now constitutes a small but dynamic segment of the vast literature on cancer genetics, in which it has played an important if not initiating role. The goals of this article are (a) to address historical and methodological aspects of cancer cytogenetics; (b) to present information on diagnostic translocations in leukemias, lymphomas, bone and soft tissue tumors, and carcinomas; (c) to connect some of these chromosomal aberrations with their molecular equivalents; and (d) to describe anomalies in some solid tumors indicative of the complexity of the genomic alterations in cancer. We also look at a few of the more recent genomic developments in cancer and offer an opinion as to what all these findings add up to.",

     "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common form of leukemia among adults in the Western world, with an incidence of approximately 1 out of 100,000 patients per year. CLL is characterized by the clonal expansion of immature CD5+ B cells. Although cytotoxic agents remain the mainstay of therapy, the disease of up to 20% of patients is not controlled with standard therapies. Therefore, there remains a need for novel therapeutic strategies. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), first identified nearly two decades ago, are noncoding RNAs that have the capacity for simultaneous regulation of tens to hundreds of genes. An association between CLL-associated chromosomal abnormalities and miRNA deregulation is beginning to emerge. miRNAs may play a biological role in the pathogenesis of CLL: specific miRNAs (miR-15a and miR-16-1) are located at a chromosomal region (13q14.3) that is often absent in patients with CLL. These same miRNAs are relevant to cellular phenotype and in vivo development of disease. This finding has led to a rapidly expanding series of investigations linking miRNAs to CLL. As a result, miRNAs are currently under investigation as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as potential therapeutic targets in CLL.",

     "abstract": "Cytogenetic abnormalities are important prognostic indicators in CLL. Historically, only interphase cytogenetics was clinically useful in CLL, because traditional mitogens are not effective mitotic stimulants. Recently, CpG-oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) stimulation has shown effectiveness in CLL cells. The CLL Research Consortium tested the effectiveness and reproducibility of CpG-ODN stimulation for detecting chromosomally abnormal clones by five laboratories. More clonal abnormalities were observed after culture of CLL cells with CpG-ODN than with the traditional pokeweed mitogen plus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (PWM+TPA). All clonal abnormalities in PWM+TPA cultures were observed in CpG-ODN cultures, whereas CpG-ODN identified some clones not found by PWM+TPA. CpG-ODN stimulation of one normal control sample and 12 CLL samples showed that, excepting clones of del(13q) in low frequencies and one translocation, results in all five laboratories were consistent, and all abnormalities were concordant with FISH. Abnormal clones in CLL were more readily detected with CpG-ODN stimulation than with traditional B-cell mitogens. With CpG-ODN stimulation, abnormalities were reproducible among cytogenetic laboratories. CpG-ODN did not appear to induce aberrations in cell culture, but did enhance detection of abnormalities and complexity in CLL. Because karyotypic complexity is prognostic and is not detectable by standard FISH analyses, stimulation with CpG-ODN is useful for identifying this additional prognostic factor in CLL.",

     "abstract": "Five laboratories in the Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) Research Consortium (CRC) investigated standardizing and pooling of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results as a collaborative research project. This investigation used fixed bone marrow and blood cells available from previous conventional cytogenetic or FISH studies in two pilot studies, a one-day workshop, and proficiency test. Multiple FISH probe strategies were used to detect 6q-, 11q-, +12, 13q-, 17p-, and IGH rearrangements. Ten specimens were studied by participants who used their own probes (pilot study 1). Of 312 FISH interpretations, 224 (72%) were true-negative, 74 (24%) true-positive, 6 (2%) false-negative, and 8 (3%) false-positive. In pilot study no. 2, each participant studied two specimens using identical FISH probe sets to control for variation due to probe sets and probe strategies. Of 80 FISH interpretations, no false interpretations were identified. At a subsequent workshop, discussions produced agreement on scoring criteria. The proficiency test that followed produced no false-negative results and 4% (3/68) false-positive interpretations. Interpretation disagreements among laboratories were primarily attributable to inadequate normal cutoffs, inconsistent scoring criteria, and the use of different FISH probe strategies. Collaborative organizations that use pooled FISH results may wish to impose more conservative empiric normal cutoff values or use an equivocal range between the normal cutoff and the abnormal reference range to eliminate false-positive interpretations. False-negative results will still occur, and would be expected in low-percentage positive cases; these would likely have less clinical significance than false positive results. Individual laboratories can help by closely following rigorous quality assurance guidelines to ensure accurate and consistent FISH studies in their clinical practice and research.",

     "abstract": "To understand the influence of chromosomal alterations on gene expression in a genome-wide view, chromosomal imbalances detected by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chips were compared with global gene expression in 16 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). A strong concordance between chromosomal gain or loss and increased or reduced expression of genes in the affected regions was found, respectively. Regions of uniparental disomy (UPD) were rare and had usually no consistent influence on gene expression, but in one instance, a large UPD was associated with a downregulation of most genes in the affected chromosome. The frequently deleted miRNAs, MIRN15A and MIRN16-1, did not show a reduced expression in cases with monoallelic deletions. The BCL2 protein, considered to be downregulated by these miRNAs, was upregulated not only in CLL with biallelic deletion of MIRN15A and MIRN16-1, but also in cases with monoallelic deletion. This suggests a complex regulation of BCL2 levels in CLL cells. Taken together, in CLL, a global gene dosage effect exists for chromosomal gains and deletions and in some instances for UPDs. We did not confirm a consistent correlation between MIRN15A and MIRN16-1 expression levels and BCL2 protein levels, indicating a complex regulation of BCL2 expression.",

     "abstract": "To better understand the implications of genomic instability and outcome in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), we sought to address genomic complexity as a predictor of chemosensitivity and ultimately clinical outcome in this disease. We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) with a one-million probe array and identified gains and losses of genetic material in 48 patients treated on a chemoimmunotherapy clinical trial. We identified chromosomal gain or loss in \u22656% of the patients on chromosomes 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 17. Higher genomic complexity, as a mechanism favoring clonal selection, was associated with shorter progression-free survival, and predicted a poor response to treatment. Of interest, CLL cases with loss of p53 surveillance showed more complex genomic features and were found both in patients with a 17p13.1 deletion and in the more favorable genetic subtype characterized by the presence of 13q14.1 deletion. This aCGH study adds information on the association between poor trial response and increasing genetic complexity as CLL progresses.",

     "abstract": "To further clarify the transformation from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) to plasma cell myeloma (PCM), we compared interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) patterns in 381 MGUS and 301 PCM patients. According to the World Health Organization and the International Myeloma Working Group, a threshold of 10% of bone marrow plasma cells separated MGUS from PCM. After magnetic activated cell sorting for CD138+ cells, FISH succeeded in 272 of 301 (90.4%) PCM, but in only 302 of 381 (79.3%) MGUS cases (P < 0.001). Cytogenetic alterations were more frequent in PCM (237 of 272; 87.1%) than MGUS (169 of 302; 56.0%; P = 0.0002). PCM showed a median of two cytogenetic alterations (range, 0\u20139) and MGUS one (range, 0\u20136). Considering only cases with a yield of plasma cells allowing five or more FISH probes, del(13)(q14) was found in 99 of 251 (39.3%) PCM but in only 59 of 267 (22.1%) MGUS (P = 0.0001), del(17p) in 15 PCM (6.0%) and in 6 MGUS (2.2%) patients (P = 0.029). A t(4;14)/IGH-FGFR3 was detected in 28 PCM (11.1%) and 5 MGUS (1.9%; P < 0.001). The t(11;14)/IGH-CCND1 and the t(14;16)/IGH-MAF showed no significant differences. Cytomorphology detected higher numbers of plasma cells than multiparameter flow cytometry (median ratio 4.25). This study underlines the genetic heterogeneity of MGUS similar to PCM.

A recent array-based study implicated the presence of copy-number variations (CNV) of the region encompassing CHST9 in the genomes of acute myelogenous leukemia. Most of the current studies, however, focused on the genome-wide screening of CNV, and the functional impact of such regions needs to be extensively investigated in large amounts of clinical samples. In our study, we collected 617 bone marrow samples from multi-types of hematologic malignancies, as well as healthy controls, and detected the CNV of CHST9 by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We found significant association between the CNV of CHST9 and these hematologic malignancies including acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. We also examined CHST9 mRNA expression in the samples with one or two copies of DNA, and observed a weak yet positive correlation between the relative expression level and gene dosage. In general, the CNV of CHST9 have been shown to associate with hematologic malignancies. The functional consequences of CNV, however, need to be investigated extensively in the future.",

     "abstract": "Fanconi Anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by congenital abnormalities, progressive marrow failure and predisposition to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and solid tumors. The most common acquired chromosomal aberrations in FA patients are trisomy of 1q and monosomy of chromosome 7; the latter is known to be associated with poor prognosis. A few reports also suggest that gains of 3q are associated with progression to MDS\u2013AML and overall poor prognosis. It is not uncommon for patients with Fanconi anemia to have easily detectable (oligoclonal) chromosomal alterations in their still normal (nonmalignant) marrow, which makes it even more challenging to determine the import of such alterations. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal analysis of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for gains in 1q and 3q and for monosomy 7 and 7q deletions on 212 bone marrow samples from 77 children with FA treated at our institution between 1987 and 2007. Given the baseline increased chromosomal instability and defective DNA repair in patients with FA, which leads to unbalanced chromosomal aberrations such as deletions, insertions, and translocations, for the purpose of this analysis an abnormal clone was defined as \u226510% abnormal cells. Chromosome 3 and 7 aberrations were associated with increased risk of developing MDS\u2013AML (P = 0.019 and P < 0.001 respectively), although the significance of chromosome 3 aberrations disappeared when different observation times were accounted for. Gain of 1q alone did not predict development of MDS\u2013AML. In conclusion, children with FA should be followed closely with FISH analyses, because some of the clonal chromosomal abnormalities may be early indicators of progression toward MDS\u2013AML and thus also of the need for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.",

In all patients, G banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization for 5q were performed, and in MDS patients with 5q deletion, the deleted region on chromosome 5 was mapped with fluorescence in situ hybridization for EGR1, CSF1R, and PDGFRB. The frequency of isolated del(5q) syndrome and 5q deletion was 2.2% (3 of 137 patients) and 15.3% (21 of 137 patients), respectively. International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) groups were low risk (5.8%), intermediate 1 (51.1%), intermediate 2 (27.8%), and high risk (15.3%). The patients with del(5q) were significantly older (62 years) and showed an unfavorable survival compared to patients without del(5q). Half (53%) of the patients with del(5q) also had complex chromosome abnormalities, including chromosome 7 abnormalities. Of the patients with del(5q), 93.3% were deleted for all three regions on 5q, compared to 66.7% of patients with isolated del(5q). Marker chromosomes proved to be chromosome 5 with interstitial deletion of q arm by fluorescence in situ hybridization in three patients. The biological characteristics of MDS in Korea seem to be markedly different from those of Caucasians, with Koreans having a younger age, lower frequencies of 5q\u2212 syndrome, higher frequencies of complex cytogenetic abnormalities including del(5q), and poorer prognosis. We infer that additional chromosome abnormalities contribute to the adverse prognostic impact in patients with del(5q).",

     "abstract": "Metakaryotic cells and syncytia with large, hollow, bell-shaped nuclei demonstrate symmetrical and asymmetrical amitotic nuclear fissions in microanatomical positions and numbers expected of stem cell lineages in tissues of all three primordial germ layers and their derived tumors. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization, mononuclear metakaryotic interphase cells have been found with only 23 centromeric and 23 telomeric staining regions. Syncytial bell-shaped nuclei found approximately during weeks 5\u201312 of human gestation display 23 centromeric and either 23 or 46 telomeric staining regions. These images suggest that (1) homologous chromatids pair at centromeres and telomeres, (2) all paired telomeres join end-to-end with other paired telomeres in all mononuclear and some syncytial metakaryotic cells, and (3) telomere junctions may open and close during the syncytial phase of development. Twenty-three telomeric joining figures could be accounted by 23 rings of one chromatid pair each, a single pangenomic ring of 23 joined chromatid pairs, or any of many possible sets of oligo-chromatid pair rings. As telomeric end-joining may affect peri-telomeric gene expression, a programmed sequence of telomeric end-joining associations in metakaryotic stem cells could guide developmental arboration and errors in, or interruptions of, this program could contribute to carcinogenesis.",

To test for the presence of CIN in high hyperdiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia (HeH ALL) at diagnosis, we investigated 20 patients (10 HeH ALL and 10 non-HeH ALL), using automated four-color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I-FISH) with centromeric probes for chromosomes 4, 6, 10, and 17. In HeH ALL, the proportion of abnormal cells ranged from 36.3% to 92.4%, and a variety of aneuploid populations were identified. Compared with conventional cytogenetics, I-FISH revealed numerous additional clones, some of them very small. To investigate the nature and origin of this clonal heterogeneity, we determined average numerical CIN values for all four chromosomes together and for each chromosome and patient group. The CIN values in HeH ALL were relatively high (range, 22.2\u201344.7%), compared with those in non-HeH ALL (3.2\u20136.4%), thus accounting for the presence of numerical CIN in HeH ALL at diagnosis. We conclude that numerical CIN may be at the origin of the high level of clonal heterogeneity revealed by I-FISH in HeH ALL at presentation, which would corroborate the potential role of CIN in tumor pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "In a study population of 45 patients who were previously enrolled in an imatinib dose escalation trial, genome-wide screening for regions of genetic gains and losses was performed using array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Early molecular response (EMR), defined as >50% reduction in the ratio of BCR-ABL1 to ABL1 within 6 months after dose escalation, was a major endpoint for analysis. After aCGH analysis, copy number change of four genes was investigated in 52 patients as a validation. Copy number gain in 16p11.2 was more frequently observed in patients with EMR than in patients who failed to achieve EMR (P = 0.034). A tendency for increased copy number in 22q11.23 in patients without EMR and for decreased copy number in 17q12 in patients with EMR was observed (P = 0.072 and P = 0.070, respectively). For GSTT1, in 22q11.23, copy number gain was observed in patients without EMR (P = 0.035). GSTT1 copy number gain was related to short time to treatment failure (TTFx) in patients without BCR\u2013ABL1 mutations (P = 0.007). In multivariate analysis, GSTT1 copy number gain was an independent predictive factor for short TTFx (P = 0.020). We conclude that chromosome regions 16p11.2, 22q11.23, and 17q12 are potential locations related to response in imatinib dose escalation therapy for CML.

We evaluated EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with two different clones (EGFR.31G7 and EGFR.25) and gene copy number by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with Locus specific identifier EGFR/CEP 7 dual probe in 62 triple-negative breast carcinomas. Any complete or incomplete membranous and/or cytoplasmic expression was regarded as IHC positive. Cases showing gene amplification (a ratio of EGFR gene to chromosome 7 of \u22652 or 15 copies per cell in \u226510% of cells) and high polysomy (\u22654 copies in \u226540% of cells) were considered FISH positive.

Here, we report that membranous EGFR expression is associated with increased gene copy number (P = 0.035 for EGFR.31G7 and P = 0.026 for EGFR.25 clone). Because the markers to predict anti-EGFR treatment response in other system tumors such as EGFR mutation and amplification seem to be rare events in breast cancer, membranous staining pattern of EGFR might be the best way to decide the patient eligibility for anti-EGFR therapy.",

For high-risk Turkish prostate cancer (PCa) patients, however, there are no data available about mutations of germline BRCA genes. To accurately determine the contribution of germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 in Turkish BC, OC, and PCa high-risk patients, 106 high-risk BC\u2013OC patients, 50 high-risk PCa patients, and 50 control subjects were recruited. The study represents the only full screening, to date, of a large series of Turkish high-risk BC\u2013OC patients and the only study in Turkish high-risk PCa patients. Mutation screenings were performed on coding exons of both genes with either denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis or denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, or with both techniques. Three deleterious mutations in BRCA1 and three deleterious mutations in BRCA2 were detected in different BC\u2013OC patients, and one truncating mutation was detected in a high-risk PCa patient. In addition, 28 different unclassified and mostly novel variants were detected in both genes, as well as several silent polymorphisms. These findings reflect the genetic heterogeneity of the Turkish population and are relevant to genetic counseling and clinical management.",

Urine specimens from 50 patients with UUTT and 25 donors without evidence of urothelial tumors were analyzed by cytology and FISH. Voided urine samples from 20 normal individuals were used to establish the cut-off values for FISH assay. The McNemar test was applied for sensitivity and specificity. The overall sensitivity of FISH was statistically significantly greater than that of cytology (84.0 vs. 40.0%, P=0.000). The overall specificities of FISH and urine cytology were all 96.0% (P=1.000). Polysomy in chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 were 38, 42, and 30%, respectively. Heterozygous and homozygous loss of the p16 locus was found in 36 and 32%, respectively. FISH analysis performed on cells collected from voided urine is feasible, and\u00a0FISH could prove to be a reliable and less invasive ancillary test and improve the sensitivity of urine cytology in the diagnosis of UUTT.",

     "abstract": "Tobacco smoke containing numerous derived chemical carcinogens is the main risk factor for urothelial carcinoma. These carcinogens can induce DNA damage leading to chromosomal instability, which plays a fundamental role in urothelial carcinogenesis. Possible mechanisms could be centrosomal aberrations, which cause defective spindles and may be responsible for genetic instability. We evaluated the effect of urine from never smokers (NS) and current smokers (CS) in concentrations of 0 to 50% on cell proliferation, chromosomes, centrosomes, and the spindle status of normal human dermal fibroblasts and normal human urothelial cells (UROtsa). After 2 weeks of urine treatment, cell cultures were analyzed by centrosome and spindle immunostaining and conventional cytogenetics. Effects were compared to results of untreated controls. Analysis of normal human dermal fibroblasts and UROtsa cells revealed that urine from CS induced higher values of centrosome aberrations in a dose-dependent and cell line-independent manner when compared to cultures treated with urine from NS and untreated controls. Centrosomal alterations correlated with\u00a0spindle defects and an increase of sporadic chromosomal aberrations. The observations suggest a causative role of chemical carcinogens in urine from CS in the origin of centrosome and spindle defects in\u00a0vitro leading to chromosomal instability and may be involved in urothelial carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Amplification of the two oncogenes ERBB2 and MYC and deletion of the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are frequently encountered in cancerous tissues. The purpose of this study was to use the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique for the assessment of ERBB2 and MYC amplification and TP53 deletion, and to relate these molecular markers to clinical and pathologic factors in Saudi patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The study was conducted on 40 paraffin-embedded tissue samples originally taken from either hepatitis C virus (HCV)- or HBV-infected patients using the FISH technique. The level of ERBB2, MYC, and TP53 in the malignant group was significantly increased as compared to the control group. Of the 40 patients, 3 (7.5%) had amplification of ERBB2 gene, 4 (10%) different patients had amplification of MYC, and 26 patients (65%) had evidence of deletion of at least one allele on chromosome 17 for the TP53 gene in a high proportion of cells. There was a significant correlation between amplification of MYC oncogene and the number of tumor masses. Moreover, significant correlation was observed between poorly differentiated tumors when compared with moderate or well-differentiated tumors when MYC was analyzed. On the other hand, MYC failed to reveal any significant association between oncogene amplification and other clinicopathologic variables examined. Univariate analysis revealed a strong association between deletion of TP53 and multiple tumor mass (P< 0.001). No statistical correlation could be detected between deletion of TP53 and tumor size, grade, stage, and tumor differentiation. No significant difference could be detected in the mean survival time of patients positive for the alteration of the genes compared to the patients who showed no alterations for the same genes. However, when the stage of the tumor was analyzed, there was a significant difference in the mean survival time between patients who showed gene alterations compared to patients with no changes in the studied genes. When overall survival was analyzed, only patients with MYC amplification had a lower median survival (20.75 months) than patients without MYC amplification (35.82, P=0.009). Genetic alterations of ERBB2 and TP53 genes had no effect on survival 2 (see Results). The combination of ERBB2, MYC, and TP53 could be useful markers to stratify patients into different risk groups.",

Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been rarely reported after treatment for OS. We describe a 14-year-old boy with OS of the left ileum who developed secondary AML 15 months after completion of treatment. Cytogenetic analysis of the leukemic cells demonstrated deletion 11q23, whereas fluorescence in\u00a0situ hybridization revealed rearrangement of the MLL gene. Only the addition of the long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction technique identified the SEPT2 as the MLL fusion partner resulting in t(2;11)(q37;q23) that was reported in a very few secondary AML cases. Because of the cryptic nature of MLL translocations that cannot be detected by conventional cytogenetics or may misinterpreted as deletion, additional molecular techniques are required to identify the precise translocation partner.

FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) is generally thought to be strongly associated with poor prognosis in AML, but is rarely reported in patients with t(8;21)-AML. Expression of the neural cell-adhesion molecule (CD56) is also associated with a significantly shorter complete remission duration and survival in patients with t(8;21)-AML. Patients with t(8;21)-AML expressing CD56 have been reported to exhibit a higher incidence of granulocytic sarcoma (GS), and t(8;21)-AML with GS results in a less favorable prognosis than AML with this translocation alone. Here, we report on a 15-year-old girl with t(8;21)-AML having both CD56 expression and FLT3-ITD. This patient underwent unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation and achieved complete remission, but thereafter presented with obstructive jaundice caused by GS compression of the common bile duct without bone marrow invasion at relapse. Autopsy revealed multiple nodules of the stomach membrane and invasion into the head of the pancreas. For earlier detection of relapse, we suggest that it would be useful to examine existence of GS in CD56-positive t(8;21)-AML patients at diagnosis and hematologic remission. Even though t(8;21)-AML is less likely to co-occur with FLT3-ITD in pediatric patients, this report suggests that prognostic factors, including FLT3 and KIT genes and the surface marker CD56, should be analyzed in these patients.",

We have used multiplex amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH) in a fourfold multiplex (QuadMAPH), positioned at an average resolution of one probe per 2 kb, to screen a total of 1.56 Mb of genomic DNA for copy number variants around the genes APC, AXIN1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CTNNB1, HRAS, MLH1, MSH2, and TP53. Two deletion events were detected, one upstream of MLH1 in a control individual and the other in APC in a colorectal cancer patient, but these do not seem to correspond to copy number polymorphisms with measurably high population frequencies. In summary, by means of our QuadMAPH assay, copy number measurement data were of sufficient resolution and accuracy to detect any copy number variants with high probability. However, this study has demonstrated a very low incidence of deletion and duplication variants within intronic and flanking regions of these nine genes, in both control individuals and colorectal cancer patients.",

One of the best-characterized epigenetic changes is aberrant methylation of cytosines that occur in so-called CpG islands. DNA hypomethylation, prevalent as a genome-wide event, usually occurs in more advanced stages of tumor development. In contrast, DNA hypermethylation is often observed as a discrete, targeted event within tumor cells, resulting in specific loss of gene expression. Interestingly, it was found that sporadic and inherited cancers may exhibit similar DNA methylation patterns, and many genes that are mutated in familial cancers have also been found to be hypermethylated, mutated, or deleted in sporadic cancers.

In the remaining cases, NUT is fused to BRD3 or an unknown partner gene; these tumors are termed NUT-variant. Diagnosis of NMC is made by demonstration of expression of the NUT-fusion protein using a monoclonal antibody to NUT for immunohistochemistry, and confirmation of the fusion (BRD\u2013NUT or NUT-variant) by fluorescent in situ hybridization or reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction. BRD\u2013NUT functions to block cellular differentiation and promote uncontrolled growth of carcinoma cells.

Approximately 94% of the malignancies is represented by well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma originating from follicular cells. These neoplasms are divided into two main categories, papillary thyroid carcinoma and follicular thyroid carcinoma. Despite their origin from the same type of cells, the two neoplasias show different biological behavior and a different set of genetic features, including specific cytogenetic patterns. Thyroid adenoma is the benign counterpart of follicular carcinoma. No benign counterpart of papillary carcinoma has yet been identified. The chromosomes of thyroid nodules have been investigated since 1965, and different cytogenetic subgroups have been recognized, some of which show structural chromosomal rearrangements. These structural changes lead to the formation of fusion genes RET-PTC, TRK(-T), and BRAF-AKAP9, which originate as a result of intrachromosomal or interchromosomal rearrangements and are found in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Fusion genes involving PPAR\u03b3 are caused mainly by translocations and are characteristic of follicular neoplastic tissue. Radiation exposure and the particular architectural arrangement of chromatin regions in which the affected genes lie during interphase are thought to favor the formation of fusion genes in papillary thyroid carcinoma and possibly also in follicular thyroid carcinoma.",

Other pheochromocytoma-associated syndromes include von Hippel\u2013Lindau disease; neurofibromatosis 1; the recently defined paraganglioma syndromes type 1, 3, and 4; Carney\u2013Stratakis syndrome; and the Carney triad. Carney\u2013Stratakis syndrome is characterized by the association of paragangliomas and familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors. In the Carney triad, patients can manifest gastrointestinal stromal tumors, lung chondroma, paraganglioma, adrenal adenoma and pheochromocytoma, esophageal leiomyoma, and other conditions. The Carney complex is yet another form of MEN that is characterized by skin tumors and pigmented lesions, myxomas, schwannomas, and various endocrine neoplasias.",

     "abstract": "After the first draft sequence of the human genome was announced by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium and Celera Genomics in February 2001, this and subsequent sequences have been instrumental for the systematic analysis of various human genomes, including the cancer genome. Now we are moving into an era in which comprehensive sequence-based information on vast numbers of tumors can be obtained. Such information can provide novel and detailed perspectives on how individual tumors develop. As a corollary, this information can be used to generate novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and to design novel therapeutic strategies. Because these advances are moving rapidly, any state-of-the-art overview is likely to be outdated before it reaches publication. Nevertheless, data presented at the 12th European Workshop on Cytogenetics and Molecular Genetics of Solid Tumors, held June 3\u20136, 2010, at Nijmegen in The Netherlands, and of which the abstracts are included in this special issue of Cancer Genetics and Cytogenetics, may provide a basis for such an overview. Although one nowadays hears talk of the post-genome era, we are in fact still very much within the genome era; indeed, most of the work presented at the workshop dealt with the cancer genome. Other emerging areas were also addressed, however, including the cancer epigenome, the cancer transcriptome, and the cancer fragilome.",

This correction is most commonly performed by using endogenous control genes, which are stably expressed across samples, as reference genes for normal expression in a specific tissue. In microRNA (miRNA) studies, two types of control genes are commonly used: small nuclear RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs. In this study, six different endogenous control genes for miRNA studies were investigated in prostate tissue material from the Swedish Watchful Waiting cohort. The stability of the controls was investigated using two different software applications, NormFinder and BestKeeper. RNU24 was the most suitable endogenous control gene for miRNA studies in prostate tissue materials.",

The influence of TP53 codon 72, MDM2 SNP309, and MDM2 C1797G polymorphisms in southern Chinese PCa patients was investigated. In the comparison of genotype distributions of TP53 codon 72 between cases and controls, the adjusted odds ratios for PCa associated with the Pro/Pro, Arg/Pro, and Arg/Arg genotypes were 1.00, 1.89 (95% CI\u00a0= 1.20\u20132.97), and 2.01 (95% CI = 1.11\u20133.64), respectively; however, MDM2 SNP309 and C1797G did not show any significant difference between cases and controls. When TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms were combined based on the numbers of variant risk alleles (i.e., G-allele of TP53 codon 72, G-allele of MDM2 SNP309, and G-allele of MDM2 C1797G), individuals with 3\u20135 variants had a 1.56-fold greater risk of PCa than those with 0\u20132 variants (95% CI = 1.07\u20132.26). Moreover, subjects with 0\u20132 variants had 33.3% positive p53 expression, whereas subjects with 3\u20135 variants had 23.3% p53 expression (P = 0.39). These findings suggest that TP53 and MDM2 polymorphisms play a role in PCa susceptibility in southern Chinese Han population.",

We investigated DNA copy number aberrations in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines using a high-density oligonucleotide microarray and found frequent amplification at the chromosomal region 3q26. The estimated extent of the minimal overlapping region of amplification was 1.3 Mb. This chromosomal region includes a single gene, SOX2. The SOX2 protein was overexpressed in cell lines in which the gene was amplified. Knockdown experiments showed that SOX2 promotes proliferation of ESCC cells. Genes potentially modulated by SOX2 were determined by expression array analyses combined with small interfering RNA cell-transfection studies. A copy number gain of SOX2 (>2-fold) was observed in 6 of the 40 primary ESCCs (15%). Immunohistochemical study revealed that expression of the SOX2 protein was significantly elevated in 62 of the 89 ESCC tumors (70%), compared with their nontumorous counterparts, and that upregulated expression of SOX2 was associated with poor differentiation of ESCC. Our results suggest that SOX2 is likely to be a target of the 3q26 amplification and may therefore be involved in the development or progression of ESCC.",

Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing revealed that the t(1;21) results in out-of-frame RUNX1-CLCA2 fusions. Alternative splicing generates at least six fusion transcripts, including a major transcript fusing RUNX1 exon 6 with CLCA2 exon 2. These out-of-frame fusions produce putative truncated RUNX1 isoforms retaining the DNA binding Runt domain but not the transcriptional regulatory domain of RUNX1. No mutations were found in the exons encoding the Runt and C-terminal domains of the nonrearranged RUNX1 gene. Similar to truncated RUNX1 isoforms previously described, these shortened products could act as dominant negative inhibitors of RUNX1-dependent transactivation. CLCA2 is a breast tumor suppressor gene that encodes a member of the calcium-activated chloride channel family and is involved for the first time in a chromosomal translocation. The RUNX1-CLCA2 fusion is another example of out-of-frame fusion generating truncated RUNX1 isoforms that represent a recurrent molecular mechanism in RUNX1-related leukemias.",

AK AML karyotype was diverse, involving no favorable and largely (8 of 17) complex cytogenetics. Despite clear cytogenetic differences, immunophenotype and NPM1/FLT3 gene mutation status did not change between presentation and relapse in 83% (10 of 12) and 94% (15 of 16) cases, respectively. High-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) performed via paired aCGH on NK AML and AK AML samples from the same patient confirmed cytogenetic aberrations only in the relapse sample. Analysis of 16 additional diagnostic NK AML samples revealed no evidence of submicroscopic aberrations undetected by conventional cytogenetics in any case. These results favor evolution of NK AML leukemia cells with acquisition of novel genetic changes as the most common etiology of AK AML relapse as opposed to secondary leukemogenesis. Additional studies are needed to confirm whether AK AML cells represent selection of rare preexisting clones below aCGH detection and to further characterize the molecular lesions found at time of AK AML relapse.",

Cases with the PICALM\u2013MLLT10 fusion gene can involve a diagnostic dilemma for the following reasons: (1) the fusion gene occurs very rarely, (2) the cases do not have a distinct myeloid or lymphoid morphology and cells often appear immature, (3) cases usually have a mixed T-cell and myeloid phenotype, and (4) cases often have a mixed clinical presentation (e.g., mediastinal mass in a patient with AML). A 27-year-old woman was diagnosed with AML with the PICALM\u2013MLLT10 fusion gene. The patient was treated on an AML regimen and achieved a complete remission. Although the reported treatment of these patients varies greatly, outcome remains very poor in the vast majority. Furthermore, central nervous system involvement at diagnosis and relapse are reported in pediatric populations. Routine acute leukemia fluorescence in situ hybridization panels do not include a probe for the PICALM\u2013MLLT10 fusion gene, and therefore diagnosis can be made only when karyotyping is available; that delay can result in initial misdiagnosis and mistreatment. The case report and literature review here (including discussion of the poor prognosis and of management, including CNS prophylaxis) are intended to raise awareness and to inform about PICALM\u2013MLLT10 in acute leukemia.",

The possibility of underlying genetic abnormalities in these familial BCCs has not been explored previously. The present study investigated a possible genetic abnormality in two members of a family with multiple nonsyndromic BCCs. The possibility of Gorlin syndrome in this family was excluded by both the absence of any clinical and radiological features and the lack of mutation in PTCH1. Notably, whole-genome comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) identified a microdeletion in chromosome 22q11.1 in both of the studied cases. A tiling path CGH array of the 22q11.1 region confirmed this microdeletion and mapped it between 14.46 and 14.5 Mb on chromosome 22q. The 34-kb region of this microdeletion includes three annotated genes: LOC644525, LOC100132389, and LOC729057.

We genotyped 102 members from 90 families for CHEK2*1100delC.

From a histological standpoint, the tumor exhibited extensive hyalinization, very low mitotic activity (<1/10 HPH), and no cytologic atypia. Smooth muscle differentiation was confirmed by the expression of smooth muscle actin and desmin. Standard cytogenetic analysis showed the reciprocal translocation t(7;12)(q31.2;q14.3). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed a balanced rearrangement of the HMGA2 locus in 80% of the cells. 3'RACE reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction identified the fusion of HMGA2 exon 4 to the COG5 locus on 7q31 (component of oligomeric golgi complex 5 isoform). The fusion sequence is predicted to encode a 96-amino acid chimeric protein that retains all three DNA-binding domains (AT hooks) of HMGA2, but that is shorter than the original HMGA2 protein. Since the general structure of the fusion gene is similar to other previously described HMGA2 fusions, its biologic activity is predicted to be likely similar.",

Using automated DNA sequencing, we tested individuals for BRCA mutations, based on positive family history of either breast or ovarian cancer or both. Two novel mutations (c.4765_4784del in BRCA1 exon 15 and c.4367_4368dupTT in BRCA2 exon 11) were detected, in three probands from two different families. These mutations have not been reported previously in the BIC or LOVD databases. Protein products of these mutated alleles lack domains necessary for their DNA repair functions, an indicator that these are deleterious mutations. Neither mutation was found in any proband from 50 other families with hereditary predisposition, so the two mutations are likely family-specific rather than population-specific. Although BRCA1-associated tumors are typically negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and ERBB2, the novel BRCA1 mutation identified in this study was detected in a proband with ER- and PR-positive breast cancer.

The occurrence of neocentromeres in tumor cells, however, may be underestimated because of technical limitations during the routine diagnostic chromosomal analysis. The prognostic impact is therefore currently unknown.",

     "abstract": "Common fragile sites (CFS) are specific regions of the mammalian chromosomes that are particularly prone to gaps and breaks. They are a cause of genome instability, and the location of many CFS correlates with breakpoints of aberrations recurrent in some cancers. The molecular characterization of some CFS has not clarified the causes of their fragility. In this work, by using fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with BAC and PAC clones, we determined the DNA sequence of the CFS FRA7B. The FRA7B sequence was then analyzed to identify coding sequences and some structural features possibly involved in fragility. FRA7B spans about 12.2 megabases, and is therefore one of the largest CFS analyzed. It maps at the 7p21.3-22.3 chromosome bands, therefore at the interface of G- and R-band regions that are probably difficult to replicate. A 90-kilobase long sequence that presents very high flexibility values was identified at the very beginning of the more fragile CFS region. Three large genes (THSD7A, SDK1, and MAD1L1) and two miRNA genes (MIRN589 and MIRN339) map in the fragile region. The chromosome band 7p22 is a recurrent breakpoint in chromosome abnormalities in different types of neoplasm. FRA7B is the first characterized CFS located in a chromosome terminal region.",

     "abstract": "The in vitro growth of cells from uterine fibroids is characterized by an early onset of senescence. Often, an even lower growth potential than that of matching myometrial cells is noted. Also, the tremendous differences in the expression of the high mobility group protein HMGA2 seen when comparing fibroids of different genetic subtypes are surprisingly not reflected by significant differences in their growth potential in vitro. We aimed to evaluate possible changes of the HMGA2 expression level between the native tissue and cell cultures, so we performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction studies that revealed a marked decrease of the HMGA2 mRNA in culture in those cases with overexpression of HMGA2. In the two cases initially showing the highest expression, it decreased by approximately 97%. Associated with the decrease of HMGA2 was a clearly increased expression of the senescence-associated p19Arf. Together, these findings explain the similar behavior of cell cultures from fibroids of different genetic subgroups and may also offer an explanation for the early onset of in vitro senescence in these cell cultures.",

Loss of normal chromosome 3 and duplication of the inverted chromosome have been proposed as the most likely mechanism, but have not been shown experimentally. We present a 36-year-old male with an initial diagnosis of CML and resistance to imatinib mesylate. Chromosome analysis showed an inversion within the long arm of both homologues of chromosome 3 and an interstitial deletion within the long arm of one chromosome 7. The rearrangement of EVI1 locus on both homologues of chromosome 3 was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Additional FISH studies showed a cryptic insertion of ABL1 into the BCR region, and subsequent duplication of the derivative chromosome 22. The single-nucleotide polymorphism array showed copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 3 and 22, suggesting that a somatic repair mechanism is involved in the evolution of these genetic alterations.

Thirty breast tumors without BRCA mutation, along with adjacent nontumorous tissues, were genotyped for the mtDNA D-loop region and for the promoter as well as the coding region of the TP53 gene. Clinicopathological parameters were recorded and assessed. In all, 17 somatic mtDNA D-loop mutations were identified, in 13 of 30 tumor samples (43%); two mutations were novel: 544C>T and 16510A>C. Four TP53 mutations were found in six tumor samples (20%), and two (c.437G>A and c.706T>C) were novel. Only progesterone receptor status correlated with the number of somatic mtDNA D-loop mutations (likelihood chi-square test; P < 0.05). Somatic mutations in the mtDNA D-loop and in TP53 were independent of each other (Fisher's exact test; P > 0.05).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of MUC1 gene amplification and protein expression in human breast cancer development. By means of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical methods, 83 breast tissue samples were analyzed for MUC1 gene amplification and protein expression. This analysis showed MUC1 genomic amplification and a positive association with the histopathological group in 12% (1 out of 8) of benign lesions and 38% (23 out of 60) of primary invasive breast carcinoma samples (P = 0.004). Array\u2013comparative genomic hybridization meta-analysis of 886 primary invasive breast carcinomas obtained from 22 studies showed MUC1 genomic gain in 43.7% (387 out of 886) of the samples. Moreover, we identified a highly statistical significant association between MUC1 gene amplification and MUC1 protein expression assessed by immunohistochemistry and Western blot test (P < 0.0001).

The methylation of gene regions and the KRAS mutations of normal (N) and tumor tissue (T) DNA obtained from 17 patients diagnosed with SCRC and 20 healthy controls were investigated using the polymerase chain reaction and reverse-hybridization methods. There was an Asp mutation in four patients, an Asp and Ser mutations in one patient in codon 12 of the KRAS gene, and an Asp mutation in codon 13 in eight patients. Overall promoter methylation (OPM) in the SFRP2 gene was observed in one N and four T, whereas partial promoter methylation (PPM) was observed in two N and five T. OPM in the P16 gene was present in one T. In the DAPK1 gene, OPM existed in seven T and five N, while PPM was present in two N.

Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of the PDZRN3, CNTN3, STXBP5, PVRL3, HSPB8, and CCDC60 genes revealed slight variation in the copy number of transcripts, but without correlation to the chromosomal rearrangements in translocation-associated and sporadic conventional RCCs. Loss of heterozygosity at chromosome 3p and mutation of VHL occurred at the same frequency in both familial and sporadic cases.

In this study, we used five microsatellite markers to analyze the region 12q13-24 among 47 patients with colorectal cancer. The frequency of LOH and the clinicopathological data were compared using logistic regression and a chi-square test. In 34 of 47 tumor tissues (72%), LOH was detected at least in one marker. The highest LOH frequency was 34%, on the D12S129 locus; the lowest frequency was 23%, on the D12S78 locus. Loss of heterozygosity was detected as 32% on D12S83, 30% on D12S346, and 26% on D12S1660. No statistically significant correlation was found between the frequency of LOH and clinicopathological features (P > 0.05).

The majority of ES tumors are characterized by a balanced translocation t(11;22)(q24;q12), which results in the fusion of the 5' portion of EWSR1 gene with the 3'end of the FLI1 gene. Fusions with ERG, another member of the ETS family, occur in less than 10% of ES tumors, and can arise through complex chromosomal rearrangements. Here, we report a case of a 5-year-old female with an ES tumor in the thoracic region. G-banding and spectral karyotyping analysis demonstrated 46,XX,t(1;21;7)(q25;q22.3;q22). Metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using the EWSR1 break-apart probe demonstrated a normal signal on both apparently normal chromosomes 22, and an additional EWSR1-5' signal on the derivative chromosome 21. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis of RNA isolated from the tumor demonstrated a EWSR1-ERG fusion transcript, fusing exon 7 of EWSR1 and exon 11 of ERG. These results are consistent with an additional copy of the 5' portion of EWSR1, which inverted and then inserted on chromosome 21 and fused to the 3' end of ERG.

     "abstract": "A 55-year-old man sought care for aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), which developed 8 years after he had received chemotherapeutic treatment for nephrotic syndrome. The sole cytogenetic abnormality observed in bone marrow\u2013derived metaphases was a t(4;11)(q21;q23), which is a frequently occurring translocation in ALL. However, subsequent reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction for the expected mixed lineage leukemia [trithorax homolog, Drosophila] (MLL)-AFF1 fusion transcript was negative. Further fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis narrowed the 4q21 breakpoint down to a 250-kb region proximal of AFF1. This comprised four genes, of which septin11 (SEPT11) was further analyzed. Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction revealed expression of a chimeric MLL-SEPT11 transcript, thus identifying what is to our knowledge a hitherto undescribed translocation in ALL. Sequence analysis of cDNA showed in-frame fusion of MLL exon 11 to SEPT11 exon 2. This MLL-SEPT11 fusion is cytogenetically indistinguishable from the recurrent t(4;11)(q21;q23). Thus, it is crucial to characterize cytogenetic aberrations in leukemia by molecular methods, even in cases where a known recurrent translocation is presumed. This report expands the spectrum of ALL-related translocations and hypothesizes on the mechanism leading to the MLL-SEPT11 fusion. Five septins have been identified thus far as MLL fusion partners in leukemia. Their putative oncogenic role may be related to forced MLL dimerization by the septin coiled coil and GTP-binding domains, which could convert MLL to an oncogene.",

We present a novel case of Xp11.2-RCC in a 57-year-old woman. The histologic features were those of a clear-cell RCC. Molecular cytogenetic analysis showed an uncommon t(X;1)(p11.2;p34) with TFE3 rearrangement and no alteration of chromosome 3. The immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of the TFE3 protein. Only nine cases of (X;1)(p11.2;p34) have been published, most of them occurring in children or young adults.

     "abstract": "Cancers are clones of autonomous cells defined by individual karyotypes, much like species. Despite such karyotypic evidence for causality, three to six synergistic mutations, termed oncogenes, are generally thought to cause cancer. To test single oncogenes, they are artificially activated with heterologous promoters and spliced into the germ line of mice to initiate cancers with collaborating spontaneous oncogenes. Because such cancers are studied as models for the treatment of natural cancers with related oncogenes, the following must be answered: 1) which oncogenes collaborate with the transgenes in cancers; 2) how do single transgenic oncogenes induce diverse cancers and hyperplasias; 3) what maintains cancers that lose initiating transgenes; 4) why are cancers aneuploid, over- and underexpressing thousands of normal genes? Here we try to answer these questions with the theory that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation. We postulate that transgenic oncogenes initiate carcinogenesis by inducing aneuploidy. Aneuploidy destabilizes the karyotype by unbalancing teams of mitosis genes. This instability thus catalyzes the evolution of new cancer species with individual karyotypes. Depending on their degree of aneuploidy, these cancers then evolve new subspecies. To test this theory, we have analyzed the karyotypes and phenotypes of mammary carcinomas of mice with transgenic SV40 tumor virus\u2013 and hepatitis B virus\u2013derived oncogenes. We found that (1) a given transgene induced diverse carcinomas with individual karyotypes and phenotypes; (2) these karyotypes coevolved with newly acquired phenotypes such as drug resistance; (3) 8 of 12 carcinomas were transgene negative. Having found one-to-one correlations between individual karyotypes and phenotypes and consistent coevolutions of karyotypes and phenotypes, we conclude that carcinogenesis is a form of speciation and that individual karyotypes maintain cancers as they maintain species. Because activated oncogenes destabilize karyotypes and are dispensable in cancers, we conclude that they function indirectly, like carcinogens. Such oncogenes would thus not be valid models for the treatment of cancers.",

Concordance between these two methods was at 555 of 560 (99%) (kappa = 0.98, P < 0.001); only 5 of the 560 (1%) cases had discordant results. No cross-hybridizations were observed with the W2600 system, and the spectrum of HPV genotypes identified by W2600 included all the 16 high-risk genotypes.

The phospholipase C epsilon gene (PLCE1) encodes a novel ras-related protein (R-Ras) effector mediating the effects of R-Ras on the actin cytoskeleton and membrane protrusion, because R-Ras is coprecipitated with the PLCE1 protein and can increase its activity. The nature of downstream signaling pathways from Ras involved in bladder cancer remains poorly understood. We aimed to construct a small hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression plasmid against the PLCE1 gene and to observe the inhibition of human bladder carcinoma cell T24 migration by RNA interference suppressing the expression of PLCE1. Two PLCE1 plasmids (P1 and P2) were constructed and inserted into T24 cells. Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses were performed to investigate inhibition of PLCE1 expression after plasmid transfection. Invasive power of the T24 cell line was measured before and after transfection by a membrane invasion culture system (transwell chamber), gelatin enzymography, and immunocytochemistry of cells. The RT-PCR analysis of BCL2 mRNA levels among different groups of T24 cell line indicated that expression of BCL2 mRNA was lower in the two positive plasmid-transfected cell groups than in the blank control or HK-A groups. Silencing of PLCE1 might downregulate the level of MMP and BCL2 gene expression, decreasing the invasive power of bladder cancer T24 cells and thus inhibiting tumor development.",

We used immunoprecipitation to detect hybrid-R expression in two endometrial carcinoma cell lines: HEC-1a, which has low estrogen receptor (ER) expression, and Ishikawa, which is positive for ER expression. To explore the role of hybrid-R in endometrial carcinoma cells, we examined phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), which is a key molecule in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The effect of inhibiting IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin on cell cycle progression and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. Both cell lines expressed hybrid-R, and HEC-1a cells had higher expression levels than did Ishikawa cells. IGF-I induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HEC-1a cells mainly through hybrid-R; in Ishikawa cells, this effect was mediated only in part by hybrid-R. Insulin stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation partly through hybrid-R in HEC-1a cells, but not in Ishikawa cells. Both IGFs and insulin increased cellular DNA content in the S phase of the cell cycle in HEC-1a through hybrid-R. In contrast, in Ishikawa cells, only insulin enhanced DNA content in S phase through hybrid-R. Both\u00a0IGFs and insulin significantly decreased apoptosis in HEC-1a cells through hybrid-R, and a similar but moderate effect was observed in Ishikawa cells.

It is particularly important in the diagnosis of leukemias, and CGH could be a useful tool enabling more precise cytogenetic analysis of leukemic cells. A group of 89 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia was studied by means of CGH using bone marrow obtained from all consecutive pediatric patients. CGH experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction with minor modifications. In addition, each sample was examined with standard GTG technique and fluorescence in situ hybridization.

     "abstract": "Deletions of the long arm of chromosome 5 [del(5q)] are frequent chromosome aberrations with known prognosis in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), they are rare and have been reported only as karyotypic results without known prognosis. In the present study, we report a novel conventional and molecular cytogenetic study of two CLL patients carrying interstitial del(5q) in order to contribute to the identification of rare recurrent aberrations and their prognostic impact in CLL. Karyotypic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis that used probes for the most common aberrations of CLL demonstrated that del(5q) was the sole chromosome abnormality in both patients at the time of diagnosis. None of these patients had a history of exposure to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Both patients had disease that was still staged as Binet A at 28 and 18 months after diagnosis, respectively, without receiving any therapy because of their good clinical condition. Therefore, it could be suggested that del(5q) may not be associated with an adverse prognosis in CLL and is not related with therapy-induced chromosome changes. Further studies are required to elucidate the prognostic value of these deletions in more CLL patients, which could be advisable for prognostic and therapeutic purposes, as well as to identify candidate genes that may potentially play a role in the pathogenesis of CLL.",

Chromosome study showed a t(16;21)(p11.2;q22) clone in more than one third of the cells analyzed, and further investigation with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, cloning, and sequencing confirmed FUS-ERG rearrangement (type B). Patient 2 (8 months old) was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) on the basis of bone marrow morphology and immunophenotyping. Chromosome study revealed a 45,XY,-16,der(21)t(16;21)(p11.2;q22) in 50% of the cells analyzed. Further studies for the detection of a FUS-ERG chimeric transcript were conducted, and an unusual type of FUS-ERG rearrangement was discovered, which has been reported in only three patients including a 1-year-old infant with ALL.

     "publication date": "07-2010",
     "abstract": "Chromosomal translocations are common in leukemia, but little is known about their mechanism. Metnase (also termed SETMAR) is a fusion of a histone methylase and transposase protein that arose specifically in primates. Transposases were thought to be extinct in primates because they would mediate deleterious DNA movement. In primates, Metnase interacts with DNA Ligase IV (Lig IV) and promotes nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) DNA repair. We show here that the primate-specific protein Metnase can also enhance NHEJ in murine cells and can also interact with murine Lig IV, indicating that it integrated into the preexisting NHEJ pathway after its development in primates. Significantly, expressing Metnase in murine cells significantly reduces chromosomal translocations. We propose that the fusion of the histone methylase SET domain and the transposase domain in the anthropoid lineage to form primate Metnase promotes accurate intrachromosomal NHEJ and thereby suppresses interchromosomal translocations. Metnase may have been selected for because it has a function opposing transposases and may thus play a key role in suppressing translocations that underlie oncogenicity.",

     "abstract": "The multiple cancers (MC) phenotype represents an intriguing entity from both the clinical and the biomolecular points of view. Multiple cancers can arise in a patient either synchronously or metachronously and are frequently detected in hereditary disorders. Here we report the clinical and cytogenetic characterization of 48 patients developing at least three malignancies outside the context of a known genetic condition and 30 control individuals. Medical and pathology reports were registered, blood was collected for cytogenetic studies, and the standard G-banding technique was used for chromosomal analysis of the lymphocyte cultures. Chromosomal analysis of the peripheral blood cultures revealed high cytogenetic instability in 83% of patients' karyotypes that displayed structural rearrangements most often involving chromosomes X, 1, 6, and 7. Peculiar telomeric associations and marker chromosomes were detected in patients with a suspected cancer family history. The MC condition can be observed over a wide clinical range, which includes either apparently sporadic cases or families with a strong history of tumors. These findings indicate that Xq, 6p, and 7q are likely to harbor genes of importance in cancer development, and the present cytogenetic mapping may be crucial for further molecular genetic investigations to recognize a predictive cytogenetic signature useful to detect patients with a high risk of multiple malignancies.",

Identification of specific chromosome abnormalities led to the recognition of genetic subgroups based on modal chromosomal number, reciprocal translocations in B-cell ALL, or both. We report here the cytogenetic analysis of 208 patients with pre-B and B-cell ALL referred to a single laboratory between 1981 and 2008. Chromosome abnormalities were observed in 82.9% of L1/L2 ALL patients and in 83.3% of L3 patients with successful analysis at diagnosis. The proportion of diploid karyotypes tended to decrease during the period of study, from 26% to 13%, in association with technical progress and the introduction of FISH techniques. As previously reported, the incidence of high hyperdiploidy (51\u201367 chromosomes) was higher among children, whereas pseudodiploidy and hypodiploidy were higher among those >15 years of age. Structural chromosome abnormalities were more frequently observed among patients older than 15 years than in children (75.9% vs. 68.5%, respectively). As previously reported, t(9;22)(q34;q11) and t(12;21)(p13;q21) were the most frequent structural rearrangements among adults (26.9%) and children (19.7%), respectively. Almost 17% of the patients studied at diagnosis had further cytogenetic analyses at relapse, the majority showing clonal evolution toward a more complex karyotype. Although the detection of chromosome abnormalities by conventional cytogenetics and FISH techniques is an important tool in assessing risk stratification of ALL, some patients lack abnormalities with clinical relevance. The use of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) offers an alternative for identifying copy number alterations, but cannot detect balanced chromosomal rearrangements.",

To perform a more in-depth investigation of the 9p region in samples from breast carcinomas, we analyzed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 230 patients with primary breast cancer using five microsatellite markers spanning a genomic region of approximately 16.2 megabases. Genomic DNA was obtained from frozen tumor tissue, and peripheral blood was used as a normal reference. Among all samples, 171 (74%) were informative for at least 1 marker and 44 (25.73%) showed LOH. The LOH rates detected for all markers ranged from 10.29% (D9S169) to 15.97% (D9S1749). Among the informative cases for intragenic markers D9S1748 (CDKN2A) and D9S1749 (MTAP), we noticed a concordant loss of 90% (9/10). Associations between LOH frequencies and clinicopathologic parameters were found between marker D9S200 and tumor grade (P < 0.05), and between marker D9S1748 and estrogen receptor (ER) status (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our results agree with other data from the literature that point to LOH as a secondary mechanism of tumor suppressor inactivation on 9p in breast cancer, showing lower frequencies than those observed in other types of cancer. On the other hand, our results point to an interesting association between the concordant loss of genes CDKN2A and MTAP, which was not sufficiently explored in primary breast cancer.",

Both BRCA1/2 and ATM/ATR play a role in DNA repair pathways and breast cancer. The aims of our investigation were to confirm the contributions of the known polymorphisms in these genes and investigate the pattern of their interaction. A total of 360 Han Chinese blood samples were collected from 180 patients with breast cancer and 180 healthy controls. In total, five single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in these genes were genotyped using polymerase chain reaction\u2013based restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Combined effects of paired SNP were tested by the Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method and theory of Information Gain (IG). By MDR analysis, the best model was determined to be a five-locus site model. Interaction tree by the hierarchical clustering method showed that the ATR mutant rs13091637 gave a maximum stand-alone IG value, while the ATM mutant rs611646 showed the lowest IG value but had the top interaction effect. These results suggest that combined effects of the polymorphisms in these genes may confer susceptibility to breast cancer in a Chinese Han cohort (n = 360). Each of the variants, though, performs a different role in the pathogenetic mechanism of breast cancer.",

Silencing tumor suppressor genes via DNA methylation has established hypermethylation as one of the most frequent molecular alterations that may initiate and drive many types of human neoplasia including breast cancer. Detecting such epigenetic changes in DNA derived not only from tumor tissue, but also from bodily fluids, may be a promising target for the molecular analysis of cancer. In this study we examined serum, a readily accessible bodily fluid known to contain neoplastic DNA, from individuals with breast carcinoma. Using sensitive methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction, we searched for aberrant promoter hypermethylation of two normally nonmethylated genes: RAS association domain family member 1A (RASSF1A) and death-associated protein kinase 1 (DAPK1) in 26 patients with breast cancer, 16 patients with benign breast diseases, and 12 age-matched healthy controls. Hypermethylation of at least one gene was detected in 25/26 (96%) cancer patients, in 7/16 (43%) cases with benign breast diseases, and only 1/12 (8%) control subjects. Furthermore, methylation of both genes was found to be associated with ductal type of breast carcinoma. RASSF1A was hypermethylated in 18/26 cases (69%) and DAPK1 in 23/26 (88%). However, DAPK1 promoter methylation was more pronounced, as 12/23 DAPK1 methylated cases (52%) were strongly methylated (>75%) compared to the weaker methylation of RASSF1A (none of the cases with methylation at the level of >75%). These findings, if confirmed in studies of extended cohorts, may lead to useful clinical application in early diagnosis of breast cancer and better management of the neoplastic disease.",

ATO and bortezomib cooperated to induce cell death and to inhibit proliferation and apoptosis in a synergistic way. The combined treatment resulted in a stronger activation of caspase 8 and 9, moderate activation of caspase 3, and increased expression of Fas and tumor necrosis factor\u2013related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-DR5 receptors.

Gene expression assays showed that more deregulated genes were related to proliferation of leukocytes, tumorigenesis, control of cell cycle, hypoxia and oxidative stress, cytokines, PI3K-AKT, ERK-MAPK, EGF pathways, and ubiquitination. Finally, in three cases of acute myeloid leukemia, the addition of bortezomib to ATO significantly increased cytotoxicity. We conclude that the combination of bortezomib and ATO may be efficacious in the treatment of myeloid disorders.",

     "abstract": "Gene amplification is a frequent genetic abnormality in solid tumors, and many oncogenes are activated in this way. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a frequent target of gene amplification is chromosome 11, particularly chromosome region 11q23, including the MLL (myeloid/lymphoid leukemia) gene. However, the number of other amplicons from the long arm of chromosome 11 has also been described. Duplication/amplification of chromosome 11 was found by cytogenetic methods in 10 of 119 newly diagnosed patients with AML. The amplification was presented as: amplification including only the 5\u2032 segment of the MLL gene (1 patient), trisomy 11 (3 patients), partial trisomy 11q (2 patients), isochromosome 11q (1 patient), and multiple amplification of specific regions (3\u00a0patients). In two cases, amplification involved parts of not only long arm but also of short arm of the chromosome 11: 11p15 and 11p11.1 to 11p13.",

The clinical, surgical, and follow-up data for the PRCC cases treated since 1995 were taken from an institutional database. The samples were revised by an experienced pathologist, who subdivided them into types 1 and 2. The data from the cases in which the tumor karyotype was available were analyzed. Out of 1,150 patients surgically treated for renal cancer, 132 cases of PRCC were detected (prevalence 11.5%), 57 with type 1 and 75 with type 2, followed for a mean period of 50 months. Tumor diameter, peri-renal tissues, as well as venous invasion, lymphnodal, and distant metastasis were highlighted to be distributed with a significant difference between the two groups, which indicated higher aggressiveness in type 2 cases. Survival analysis has showed a significantly higher-progression risk and a shorter disease-free survival in type 2 cases. An evaluable tumoral karyotype was obtained in 26 cases. An overlapping distribution was detected in chromosomes 7, 17, 12, 16, and 20, while some alterations in chromosomes 10, 5, 6, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 8 appeared as typical of type 2 cases. In conclusion, types 1 and 2 PRCC have different pathologic and cytogenetic features and a radically different biologic behavior \u2014 indolent in type 1 and aggressive in type 2.",

Commonly, this tumor affects young adults and typically arises in the deep proximal extremities or trunk with frequent recurrences and can metastasize to the lungs many years later. Most cases have a recurrent balanced translocation involving chromosomes 7 and 16, t(7;16)(q32-34;p11), which leads to the fusion of the FUS and CREB3L2 genes. However, supernumerary ring chromosomes have been identified in a subset of FUS/CREB3L2-positive LGFMS, but it has not yet been formally demonstrated that such ring chromosomes harbor the FUS/CREB3L2 fusion gene. Here, we report the genetic findings of a supernumerary ring chromosome from an LGFMS from a 77-year-old man. Chromosome banding analysis revealed a supernumerary ring chromosome, and further studies with fluorescence in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the ring contained material from chromosomes 7 and 16, that the FUS gene was present in two rearranged copies, and that it expressed the FUS/CREB3L2 fusion gene. Moreover, an assessment of previously reported cases showed that tumors with ring chromosomes relapsed more often than tumors with a balanced t(7;16), suggesting that ring formation in LGFMS is correlated with tumor progression.",

Although screening by FISH did not reveal novel chromosomal aberrations, several sequence changes were detected. None of them were frequent events, but we identified a new potential activating mutation in the FERM domain of JAK2(R340Q). None of the germline JAK2(V617F) single-nucleotide polymorphisms detected differed in distribution between patients and control subjects.

Loss of heterozygosity was determined using microsatellite markers. The analysis on the informative cases (n = 72) indicated LOH at both the BRCA1 and FHIT loci in 25 cases (35%), the absence of LOH at both loci in 23 cases (32%), and the presence of LOH at one of the loci in 24 cases (33%). The concomitant LOH was associated with poor prognostic factors, such as large tumors (P = 0.01), axillary nodal involvement (P < 0.01), histologic grade III (P < 0.01), vascular invasion (P = 0.01), and negative hormone receptor (P = 0.02).

Two years after starting therapy, leukocytosis recurred and the bone marrow contained 8.2% large and bizarre myeloblasts.

The fluorescence intensity levels of apoptotic cells in tumor were significantly higher in the arsenic-treated groups (P < 0.05 for both treatment groups). The fluorescence intensity level of apoptotic cells in the 5-mg/kg group was higher than that in the 2.5-mg/kg group (P < 0.05). The expression of Fas protein increased in dose- and time-dependent manner after the treatment with As2O3, but that of FasL protein showed no significant difference between control and treated groups. As2O3 did not induce hepatic and renal system injury in the nude mice. As2O3 can inhibit the growth of human gastric cell implanted tumor. We ascribe this to upregulation of Fas, which can induce apoptosis of gastric cells.",

     "abstract": "We conducted comparative proteomic analysis of osteosarcoma, with hopes of identifying the specific protein markers of osteosarcoma and improve the understanding of tumorigenesis and progression of osteosarcoma. Proteins extracted from osteosarcoma tissue and benign bone tumors, including osteoblastoma, chondroblastoma, and giant cell tumor of bone, were examined using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analysis and database searches. We also validated the expression levels of interesting proteins by Western blotting assay and immunohistochemical staining. Intensity alterations of 30 spots were detected in osteosarcoma, and 18 of these spots were finally identified, including 12 up-regulated proteins and 6 down-regulated ones. The up-regulated proteins include VIM, TUBA1C, ZNF133, EZR, ACTG1, TF, and so on. The six down-regulated proteins include ADCY1, ATP5B, TUBB, RCN3, ACTB, and YWHAZ. Subsequent immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting assay for TUBA1C and ZNF133 in osteosarcoma samples confirmed the observation obtained by proteomic analysis. Our results suggest that these identified proteins may be potential biomarkers for osteosarcoma tumorigenesis and therapeutics. Aberrant expression of cytoskeletal- and microtubule-associated proteins in osteosarcoma may provide an advantage for tumor invasion and metastasis by affecting the stability of microtubule, which consequently influences the prognosis of patients.",

We collected 41 urine samples and 26 corresponding peripheral blood samples from patients with clinically suspected urothelial carcinoma. The FISH and NMP22 assays detected 92.1% of the cancers, and cytology detected 60.5%. In the low-grade group, NMP22 and FISH analyses were more sensitive than cytology, but in the high-grade group, all three methods showed approximately 90% sensitivity. Overall, the FISH and NMP22, or FISH and cytology assays combined detected 97.4% of cancers, while cytology with NMP22 detected 92.1%. In the low-grade group, the sensitivity of the three methods combined was above 80%, but in high-grade group, the combined sensitivity was approximately 100%. In the mtDNA control region, we detected characteristic heteroplasmic mtDNA substitution mutations in 1 patient and a mtDNA length heteroplasmic mutation in 303 polyC or 16184 poly C in 20 patients. Overall, urothelial carcinoma\u2013specific mtDNA mutations were observed in 20 of the 26 patients (76.9%). The average mtDNA copy numbers in urine samples and corresponding peripheral blood samples (83.45 \u00b1 60.36 and 39.0 \u00b1 24.38, respectively) (mean \u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) differed significantly (P\u00a0< 0.001). The mtDNA copy numbers in the urine samples from patients with high-grade and low-grade tumors (81.83 \u00b1 67.78 and 86.49 \u00b1 46.69, respectively) did not differ significantly (P = 0.589). In conclusion, the FISH assay showed the highest sensitivity for detecting low-grade urothelial carcinoma, and mtDNA copy numbers in urine samples were higher than those in the corresponding peripheral blood samples. The frequency of mtDNA mutations in the D-loop region in patients with cancer was approximately 80% in our study. This report further supports the significance of genetic alteration in urothelial carcinoma and the clinical utility of the FISH, mtDNA quantitation polymerase chain reaction, mtDNA sequencing, and capillary electrophoresis for this purpose.",

In the GBMs, p53 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization; TP53 sequencing was done in 15 of the GBMs. In adults, LOH of 1p or 19q was detected in 16% of DAs and 50% of GBMs; none of the AAs showed this alteration. In GBMs, LOH of 19q was most common (26%), followed by combined 1p and 19q LOH (13%) and 1p LOH (10%). Pediatric GBMs also harbored isolated 1p and 19q LOH (50%). Notably, LOH of 1p or 19q LOH was more frequent in p53 immunopositive secondary GBMs (61%) than in primary GBMs (17%). This suggests that LOH of 1p and 19q may be acquired during progression to secondary GBMs. Thus, 1p and 19q LOH can occur in astrocytic tumors, most commonly in secondary GBMs without morphological correlation with an oligodendroglial histology. The clinical significance of recognition of this subset of GBMs is based on several recent reports of association with better prognosis, although long-term follow-up studies are required.",

Karyotypes before and at relapse after allo-SCT were different in 15 patients (68%), the most frequent type being clonal evolution either alone or combined with clonal devolution (13 patients). Patients with and without a karyotype change did not differ significantly in overall survival (OS) (median, 399 vs. 452 days; P = 0.889) and survival after relapse (median, 120 vs. 370 days; P = 0.923). However, acquisition of additional structural chromosome 1 abnormalities at relapse after allo-SCT occurred more frequently than expected and was associated with reduced OS (median, 125 vs. 478 days; P = 0.008) and shorter survival after relapse (median, 37 vs. 370 days; P = 0.002). We identified a previously undescribed clonal evolution involving t(15;17) without PML-RARA rearrangement in an AML patient. We conclude that a karyotype change is common at relapse after allo-SCT in acute leukemia patients. Moreover, our data suggest that additional structural chromosome 1 abnormalities are overrepresented at relapse after allo-SCT in these patients and, in contrast to a karyotype change per se, are associated with reduced OS and shorter survival after relapse.",

We found a significant difference between the overall sensitivities of FISH and cytology (60% vs. 28.4%, respectively; P < 0.0001). The overall specificity was 99% with cytology and 94.9% with FISH, although this difference was not statistically significant. The mean values for all four probes in the true-positive group were higher than those in the false-positive group. The difference in the mean values between the two groups was significant only for the CEP3 and CEP17 probes.

The chromosomal breakpoints of the MLL\u2013NEBL and NEBL\u2013MLL fusion genes were cloned by long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction. The chromosomal breakpoints were located at 10p12, approximately 570 kb telomic of the MLLT10 (AF10) gene. AF10 and NEBL are localized in such close vicinity that they cannot be distinguished cytogenetically by G banding. Therefore, the combination of cytogenetic and independent molecular techniques such as long-distance inverse polymerase chain reaction are indispensable for the rapid identification and characterization of rare MLL rearrangements.",

CC abnormality rates were also compared to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) results using probes for CLL (LSI D13S319/13q34/CEP 12: LSI ATM/p53). Forty-five samples from 24 patients (consisting of 11 newly diagnosed and 13 previously diagnosed patients) were included. For CC, a 100.0% culture success rate was achieved (n = 45) by means of an EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) peripheral blood sample with an associated 62.5% CC abnormality rate (n = 24). FISH detected an abnormality rate of 75.0% (n = 24). The combined CC and FISH abnormality rate was 87.5% (n = 24). This study demonstrates that CC that uses TPA and DSP30 + IL-2 on EDTA peripheral blood is effective in the investigation of CLL and may be used as a supplement to FISH studies.",

In this study, FFPE and matched fresh-frozen (FF) specimens were separately analyzed with Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 6.0 and Agilent 4x44\u00a0K oligonucleotide arrays to compare the genomic profiles from the two tissue sources and to assess the relative performance of the two platforms on FFPE material. Genomic DNA was extracted from matched FFPE\u2013FF pairs of normal intestinal epithelium from four patients and were applied to the SNP and oligonucleotide platforms according to the manufacturer-recommended protocols. On the Affymetrix platform, a substantial increase in apparent copy number alterations was observed in all FFPE tissues relative to their matched FF counterparts. In contrast, FFPE and matched FF genomic profiles obtained via the Agilent platform were very similar. Both the SNP and the oligonucleotide platform performed comparably on FF material. This study demonstrates that Agilent oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization generates reliable results from FFPE extracted DNA, whereas the Affymetrix SNP-based array seems less suitable for the analysis of FFPE material.",

To further confirm the results of aCGH, copy number changes of cancer-related candidate genes in AdCC patients were compared by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Array CGH and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction data were found to correspond to delineated DNA copy number changes.

The identified KRAS and BRAF mutations were analyzed for association with tumor differentiation and clinical stage. The result showed that KRAS mutations were detected in 9.1% (11 of 121) of prostate carcinomas, while no BRAF mutation was found in any case studied. No association was found between KRAS mutation and clinicopathological characteristics of the tumors.

BM showed significantly more mean chromosomal aberrations than the primary CRC (13.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 vs. 7.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.9, P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), significantly more chromosomal gains (7.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9 vs. 3.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.9, P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), and tended to have also more losses (6.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.4 vs. 4.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1, P\u00a0=\u00a00.29). Changes that occurred significantly more often in BM than in primary CRC were gains of 8q, 12p, 12q, and 20p, as well as losses of 5q. BM of CRC show a significantly higher chromosomal instability in comparison to primary tumors. The prevalently altered genomic regions in the metastases of this study are likely to harbor genes that play an important role in the genesis of brain-specific metastasis.",

Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to screen a custom-made breast carcinoma tissue microarray representing all tumor grades, in order to detect DNA copy number changes mapping to 16p12.1 and 16q22.1. We generated 16q/16p ratios for each patient and examined the correlation between DNA copy number alterations and the patients' clinical and pathological parameters. We observed lower q/p ratios in grade I invasive carcinomas, compared with grade III carcinomas, which consistently showed high q/p ratios (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0091 and 0.0075). In addition, age adjusted for grade analysis revealed that tumors from younger patients (<45\u00a0yr) had significantly higher q/p ratios, suggesting that in younger individuals those tumors might be more aggressive (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The finding that higher q/p ratios occur in younger patients offers a tool to identify high-risk individuals most likely to proceed to high grade.",

Nonetheless, several chromosome abnormalities have not yet been completely determined, because of the low mitotic in vitro activity of B-CLL cells. Now, novel technologies such as stimulation of CLL cells with new B-cell mitogens have helped to overcome this problem. We present here a novel conventional and molecular cytogenetic study of a CLL patient with t(6;13)(p21;q14.1), a rare chromosomal aberration. The findings contribute to the identification of rare recurrent aberrations and of any prognostic effect in CLL that could be used for prognostic and therapeutic purposes. The present study demonstrates that t(6;13)(p21;q14.1) as a secondary event to the interstitial deletion in 13q14 region, resulting in the loss of RB1, is a rare but nonrandom abnormality in CLL, resistant to the current treatment CLL protocols with a rather favorable or intermediate prognosis but definitely not an adverse prognosis. Further studies in more CLL patients are required to delineate the prognostic value of t(6;13)(p21;q14.1) and to identify any candidate genes with potential role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

The accurate identification of MYC rearrangements in these three subtypes of high-grade lymphoma is becoming increasingly critical both in terms of diagnosis of classical BL and in light of the prognostic implications in cases of DLBCL and BCLU. We describe three cases of high-grade lymphoma in which cryptic insertion events, resulting in clinically significant IGH-MYC rearrangements, were detectable using an IGH/MYC three-color, dual-fusion fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe set, but were not detected using break-apart MYC FISH probes, thus highlighting the limitations of using break-apart probes as a stand-alone test, particularly with the increased use of interphase FISH analysis of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections in the diagnostic work-up of these patients.",

Here, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the expression levels of UBE2Q2 gene in a collection of 21 breast cancer tissues matched with normal adjacent counterparts. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot testing were also performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by using a rabbit polyclonal antibody that we generated against an amino acid sequence predicted from the DNA sequence of UBE2Q2 gene. In the 21 cases investigated, a high increase in the expression of UBE2Q2 mRNA was found in 8 breast cancers (38.1%), a moderately increased UBE2Q2 expression was observed in 7 cases (33.3%), and no significant changes were detected in 6 cases (28.6%) of tumor samples when compared with corresponding normal tissues. Consistently, a higher level of immunoreactivity for UBE2Q2 protein was detected in invasive epithelium of cancerous tissues when compared with that in the normal epithelium.

Therefore, we characterized the FHC cell line in terms of its tumorigenicity, cytogenetics, and TP53 gene mutation analysis. FHC cells displayed capability for anchorage-independent growth in semisolid media in vitro and formed solid tumors after transplantation into SCID (severe combined immunodeficiency) mice. This tumorigenic phenotype was associated with hypotriploidy and chromosome number ranging from 66 to 69. Results of comparative genetic hybridization arrays showed that most chromosomes included regions of copy number gains or losses. Region 8q23\u223c8q24.3 (containing, e.g., MYC proto-oncogene) was present in more than 20 copies per nucleus. Moreover, we identified mutation of TP53 gene in codon 273; triplet CGT coding Arg was changed to CAG coding His. Expression of Pro codon 72 polymorphic variant of p53 was also detected. Mutation of TP53 gene was associated with abolished induction of p21Waf1/Cip1 and MDM-2 proteins and resistance to apoptosis after genotoxic treatment. Because of their origin from normal fetal colon and their relative resistance to the induction of apoptosis, FHC cells can be considered a valuable experimental model for various studies.",

LKB1 plays a role in multiple cellular functions including cell growth, cell cycle progression, metabolism, cell polarity, and migration. To date, only a limited number of studies have assessed the status of LKB1 in cervical cancers. Herein, we investigate DNA methylation, DNA mutation, and transcription at the LKB1 locus in cervical cancer cell lines. We identified homozygous deletions of 25\u201385\u00a0kb in the HeLa and SiHa cell lines. Deletion breakpoint analysis in HeLa cells revealed that the deletion resulted from an Alu-recombination-mediated deletion (ARMD) and generated a novel LKB1 fusion transcript driven by an uncharacterized CpG island promoter located \u223c11\u00a0kb upstream of LKB1. Although the homozygous deletion in SiHa cells removes the entire LKB1 gene and portions of the neighboring genes SBNO2 and c19orf26, this deletion also generates a fusion transcript driven by the c19orf26 promoter and composed of both c19orf26 and SBNO2 sequences. Further analyses of public gene expression and mutation databases suggest that LKB1 and its neighboring genes are frequently dysregulated in primary cervical cancers. Thus, homozygous deletions affecting LKB1 in cervical cancers may generate multiple fusion transcripts involving LKB1, SBNO2, and c19orf26.",

We observed a decrease in auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity of PARP-1 proteins harboring M129T or E251K amino acid substitution, but the difference was not statistically significant. The levels of PARP-1 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation were heterogeneous among germ cell tumor cell lines. The SNPs of the PARP1 gene, as well as differences in the levels of PARP-1 and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins, may influence germ cell tumor development and responses to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.",

TFPI2, a Kunitz-type serine proteinase inhibitor, has been identified as a putative tumor-suppressor gene from genome-wide screening for aberrant methylation, using a microarray combined with the methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dCyd) in various types of tumors. We assessed the methylation status of TFPI2 and investigated its expression pattern in human primary gastric cancer (GC) tissues and in GC cell lines. Hypermethylation of the promoter CpG island, which was observed in more or less all of GC cell lines, was prevalent in a high proportion of primary GC tissues (15/18, or 83%), compared with noncancerous (4/18, or 22%) or normal (0/3, or 0%) stomach tissues, and expression of TFPI2 mRNA was reduced in 7 of the 17 primary GC tissues (41%). Moreover, immunohistochemical analyses showed decreased levels of TFPI-2 protein, compared with adjacent noncancerous tissues in 8 of the 20 primary GC tissues examined (40%). TFPI2 mRNA expression was restored in gene-silenced GC cells after treatment with 5-aza-dCyd. Aberrant methylation of TFPI2 promoter CpG island occurred not only in GC cells but also in primary GC tissues at a high frequency, suggesting that epigenetic silencing of TFPI2 may contribute to gastric carcinogenesis.",

Furthermore, patients with the CC and CA genotypes whose tumors were stages III (T4NxM0) and IV (TxNxM1) (OR = 0.38; 95%CI = 0.17\u20130.83), poorly differentiated (OR = 0.28; 95%CI = 0.09\u20130.84), and left-sided (OR = 0.45; 95%CI 0.21\u20130.98) were associated with significantly lower risk than AA patients. Young (60 years old or younger) AA patients had a 5-year lower mean age at onset than CC/CA patients (P = 0.02). Young male AA patients had worse disease-specific survival than CC/CA patients (P = 0.002). Thus, contrary to Canadians and Portuguese, the AA (rather than CC) genotype is associated with increased susceptibility and advanced pancreatic carcinoma in Chinese patients, suggesting a more complex relationship between the SNP and pancreatic carcinoma risk, possibly modulated by population differences.",

In addition to various simple translocations affecting MLL, there are also complex forms involving three or more chromosomes. Here, we describe a novel three-way translocation of t(2;19;11)(p12;p13.3;q23) in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). In this translocation, the distal 19p13.3 joins the proximal 11q23 on der(11), whereas the distal 11q23 is translocated to 2p12. Three-way translocations involving 11q23 are often difficult to detect with cytogenetic means alone. In the present case, however, the chromosomes involved in the three-way translocation were readily identifiable by GTG banding. The MLL\u2013MLLT1 fusion products from the derivative chromosome 11 were detected by reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and two splicing variant forms were confirmed by cloning and sequencing. Furthermore, the novel third partner gene, NRXN1, was detected by systematic breakpoint analysis using long-distance inverse-PCR methods (LDI-PCR). The apparent three-way translocation thus identified is noteworthy because few studies have reported complex rearrangements involving 11q23 and 19p13.3 in acute leukemias.",

Deregulation of RXR expression has been reported in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, the mechanism underlying the impaired expression of RXRs in lung cancer is not known. Aberrant methylation of promoter CpG islands is known to be a major mechanism for inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. We investigated the methylation status of the RXR genes in 139 surgically resected NSCLCs and correlated the results with the clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients. Methylation in the tumors was detected in all three genes: RXRA, 5.7%; RXRB, 4.3%; RXRG, 23.7%. Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that RXRG methylation correlates with mRNA expression. Methylation of the RXRG gene was not significantly associated with the prognosis of patients. When the patients were categorized by smoking status, however, the effect of RXRG methylation on prognosis was significantly different between never- and ever-smokers (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003, test for homogeneity). Specifically, RXRG methylation was associated with a significantly worse survival in never-smokers; a trend to better survival outcome was observed for ever-smokers, although not statistically significant. This finding suggests that methylation-associated downregulation of the RXRG gene may play a differential role in the carcinogenesis of NSCLCs according to smoking status, but further studies are needed to confirm this.",

In this study, to investigate the role of STAT3 on ovarian cancer cells, we used decoy oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) technology to regulate STAT3 in SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells in vitro. Cell invasive power and chemo-sensitivity were assessed in the cells transfected with STAT3 decoy ODN and control ODN. Western blot analysis was used to examine the expression of EMMPRIN, P-gp, and Akt. Results showed that STAT3 decoy ODN inhibited cancer cell invasive power and enhanced sensitivity to paclitaxel for SKOV3 and OVCAR3 cells. The mechanism involved the inhibition of EMMPRIN, P-gp, and pAkt by STAT3 decoy ODN. These three proteins were probably the target proteins of STAT3. These findings suggest that STAT3 is a key factor for ovarian cancer metastasis and chemoresistance. STAT3 decoy ODN may prove to be a beneficial therapeutic agent, especially for invasive or chemoresistant ovarian cancer.",

TRPV2 expression in 55 HCC patients was examined by immunohistochemistry, and the correlation between TRPV2 levels and clinicopathologic parameters was analyzed. Thirteen paired HCC specimens and their nontumor counterparts were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed that expression of TRPV2 at both the mRNA and protein levels were increased in cirrhotic livers compared with chronic hepatitis, whereas that also occurred in moderately and well-differentiated tumors compared with that of poorly differentiated tumors. Immunohistochemistry of the 55 HCC samples showed that the expression of TRPV2 increased when going from normal liver or chronic hepatitis to cirrhosis. Increased TRPV2 expression was observed in tissues of liver cirrhosis (31/37, 83.8%). In HCC, increased expression of TRPV2 was identified in 16/55 (29%) cases. Clinicopathologic assessment suggested a significant association between TRPV2 expression and portal vein invasion and histopathologic differentiation (P = 0.036 and 0.001, respectively).

Thus, an important question is whether environmental signals also affect transcription levels of cell machinery genes in a similar manner? In a\u00a0microarray analysis, we have tested the influence of light pulses on the expression of transcripts in the mouse brain. Light pulses consistently affect transcription levels of genes that are essential and directly control the cell cycle mechanism, as well as levels of genes that are associated with the various cell cycle checkpoints. The changes in the levels and the direction of these changes could possibly lead to cell cycle arrest.

Recent studies identified microRNAs of the let-7 family as post-transcriptional regulators of HMGA2. Intragenic chromosomal breakpoints might cause truncated HMGA2 transcripts lacking part of the 3' UTR. The corresponding loss of let-7 complementary sites (LCS) located in the 3' UTR would therefore stabilize HMGA2 mRNA. The aim of this study was to check UL with rearrangements of the chromosomal region 12q14\u223c15 for truncated HMGA2 transcripts by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. In 8/13 leiomyomas with aberrations of chromosomal region 12q15, the results showed the presence of the complete 3' UTR with all LCS. A differential expression with highly reduced 3\u2032 untranslated region levels was found in 5/13 myomas. In two of these, full-length transcripts were almost undetectable. Truncated transcripts were apparently predominant in roughly one-third of UL with chromosomal rearrangements affecting the HMGA2 locus, where they lead to a higher stability of its transcripts and subsequently contribute to the overexpression of the protein. The assay used is also generally suited to detect submicroscopic alterations leading to truncated transcripts of HMGA2.",

Its silencing may contribute to the carcinogenesis and progression of various tumors, which makes this gene an attractive molecular marker and a potential target for diagnosis and therapy. Little is known about transcriptional mechanisms controlling SLC5A8 gene expression. To better understand the molecular mechanisms regulating SLC5A8 expression, we characterized the 5\u2032-regulatory region and a part of exon 1. Luciferase reporter assays of deletion mutants of SLC5A8 promoter demonstrated that a 295-bp region is essential for the basal promoter activity of the SLC5A8 gene. Further analysis indicated that the CCAAT boxes and GC boxes were involved in positive regulation of SLC5A8 promoter. Overexpression of two transcription factors, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta (C/EBP\u03b2) and specific transcription factor 1 (Sp1), upregulated the activities of the human SLC5A8 promoter and protein expression, suggesting that both C/EBP\u03b2 and Sp1 transcription factors might have functions in SLC5A8 transcription.

Microsatellite instability (MSI), DNA index, and the mutation and loss of heterozygosity of the TP53 gene were systemically examined in 180 Japanese colorectal cancer cases. The correlation between these genetic features and clinicopathologic factors was analyzed. A logistic regression was undertaken to analyze the association between genetic features and tumor locations. The data demonstrated location-related genetic differences in colorectal cancer. The proximal subset was distinct in patterns of genomic instability and TP53 gene defects. The genetic features of distal colon cancers paralleled those of rectal cancers. Intriguingly, a multivariate analysis implicated MSI as the only factor significantly associated with tumor location. When MSI tumors were excluded, the statistical association between tumor location and alternations in the DNA index and TP53 vanished. The location-related differences of colorectal cancer were derived from the unequal distribution of the MSI tumors. On the other hand, the microsatellite stable colorectal cancers were genetically homogeneous regardless of the tumor location. Therefore, instead of tumor location, microsatellite status should be a major focus for the study of colorectal cancers in the future.",

Aberrant silencing of THRB in breast cancer tissue and plasma by promoter hypermethylation was investigated in the present study. Reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to examine THRB mRNA expression in the breast cancer tissues. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) combined with nested PCR was used to determine the methylation status of the THRB gene promoter region in 40 cancer tissue and 40 plasma samples from breast cancer patients. Methylation status of MSP product in plasma was also evaluated by direct sequencing. The expression of THRB mRNA in breast cancer tissues was lower than that in the normal tissues; hypermethylation was found in 32 of 40 breast cancer tissues (80%) and in 28 of 40 plasma samples (70%). Loss of THRB gene expression was associated with the CpG island hypermethylation of promoter regions. THRB gene CpG island methylation was not related to clinical pathologic parameters. Sequencing results were identical to agarose gel electrophoresis results. The present results indicate that hypermethylation of THRB as an alternative gene silencing mechanism is highly prevalent in breast cancer.

Almost 95% of these tumors are characterized by a nonrandom chromosomal abnormality, t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2), that is observed in both biphasic and monophasic variants. In this article, we present the case of a 57-year-old woman diagnosed with high-grade biphasic synovial sarcoma in which conventional cytogenetic analysis revealed the constant presence of a unique t(18;22)(q12;q13), in addition to trisomy 8. The rearrangement was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The use of the whole chromosome painting probes WCPX did not detect any rearrangements involving chromosome X, although reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis demonstrated the conspicuous presence of a SYT/SXX1 fusion gene. Spectral karyotyping (SKY) was also performed and revealed an insertion of material from chromosome 18 into one of the X chromosomes at position Xp11.2.

The inactivation of unidentified genes located in these regions appears associated with tumor progression in meningiomas, but no clues to its molecular/clinical meaning are available in schwannomas. Recent microarray gene expression studies have demonstrated the existence of molecular subgroups in both entities. In the present study, we correlated the presence of genomic deletions at 1p, 14q, and 22q with the expression patterns of 96 tumor-related genes obtained by cDNA low-density microarrays in a series of 65 tumors including 42 meningiomas and 23 schwannomas. Two expression pattern groups were identified by cDNA mycroarray analysis when compared to the expression pattern in normal control RNA in both meningiomas and schwannomas, each one with patterns similar and different from the normal control. Meningioma and schwannoma subgroups differed in the expression of 38 and 16 genes, respectively. Using MLPA and microsatellites, we identified genomic losses at 1p, 14q, and 22q at nonrandom frequencies (12.5\u201369%) in meningiomas and schwannomas. Losses at 22q were almost equally frequent in both molecular expression subgroups in both neoplasms. However, deletions at 1p and 14q accumulated in meningiomas with a gene expression pattern different from the normal pattern, whereas the inverse situation occurred in schwannomas. Those anomalies characterized the schwannomas with expression pattern similar to the normal control. These findings suggest that deletions at 1p and 14q enhance the development of an abnormal tumor-related gene expression pattern in meningiomas, but this fact is not corroborated in schwannomas.",

The ability to differentiate preoperatively between the malignant and benign forms of follicular thyroid tumors assumes greater importance in any clinical setting. The PAX8-PPARG translocation has been reported to occur in the majority of FTC. In this study, a group of 60 follicular thyroid neoplasms [18 FTC, 1 Hurthle cell carcinoma (HCC), 24 follicular thyroid adenomas (FTA), 5 Hurthle cell adenomas (HCA), and 12 follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinomas (FV-PTC)] were analyzed to determine the prevalence of the PAX8-PPARG translocation by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The PAX8-PPARG translocation was detected in 2/18 FTC (11.1%). In addition, 2/18 (11.1%) FTC and 1/5 (20%) HCA showed 3p25 aneusomy only. The frequency of the translocation detected in the study was lower compared to the earlier studies conducted in Western countries. This might be attributed to the ethnic background and geographic location. Detection of either the PAX8-PPARG translocation or the 3p25 aneusomy in FTC indicates that these are independent genetic events. It is hereby concluded that 3p25 aneusomy or PAX8-PPARG translocation may play an important role in the molecular pathogenesis of follicular thyroid tumors.",

These genes were randomly distributed on all the chromosomes. Gene ontology analysis showed that most of these genes participated in cellular and metabolic processes, and the primary molecular functions of each were catalytic activity, ion binding, and protein binding. Literature mining revealed that these genes were specifically related to apoptosis, cell cycle, metastasis, chemokines, and immunoediting, but not cancer, NPC, stem cells, lymphangiogenesis, angiogenesis, inflammation, nor proliferation. In particular, 42/60 genes have established metastatic functions (P < 0.00001), while 11 out of those 42 genes formed gene networks related to metastasis (P = 0.013). Thus, the 60 genes identified by this microarray experiment most likely represent a core set of genes that comprise shared metastatic gene networks between the two cell lines and mediate their differential metastatic characteristics. Among the gene networks identified, the PTHLH gene was of particular interest. Predicted to regulate the WNT pathway through the DKK1 gene, the PTHLH gene may affect metastasis and apoptosis of NPC and merits further study.",

High-resolution melting (HRM) analysis has been used as a tool for analysis of promoter methylation. Here, we report HRM analysis used to detect the methylation levels of ADAMTS9 gene in 100 gastric cancers, 100 colorectal cancers, 70 pancreatic cancers, and an equal number of adjacent normal tissues. The frequency of ADAMTS9 methylation in all three types of cancers was significantly higher than in normal tissues.

There was no significant association between ADAMTS9 methylation status and tumor\u2013node\u2013metastasis staging in all three types of cancers. In summary, application of HRM analysis to large numbers of clinical samples is a rapid and high-throughput way to investigate the epigenetic status of ADAMTS9.

Hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is an aggressive form of RCC characterized by germline mutation of the Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH), and one known to be highly metastatic and unusually lethal. There is considerable utility in establishing preclinical cell and xenograft models for study of disorders of energy metabolism, as well as in development of new therapeutic approaches targeting of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme\u2013deficient human cancers. Here we describe a new immortalized cell line, UOK 262, derived from a patient having aggressive HLRCC-associated recurring kidney cancer. We investigated gene expression, chromosome profiles, efflux bioenergetic analysis, mitochondrial ultrastructure, FH catabolic activity, invasiveness, and optimal glucose requirements for in vitro growth. UOK 262 cells have an isochromosome 1q recurring chromosome abnormality, i(1)(q10), and exhibit compromised oxidative phosphorylation and in vitro dependence on anaerobic glycolysis consistent with the clinical manifestation of HLRCC. The cells also display glucose-dependent growth, an elevated rate of lactate efflux, and overexpression of the glucose transporter GLUT1 and of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Mutant FH protein was present primarily in edematous mitochondria, but with catalytic activity nearly undetectable. UOK 262 xenografts retain the characteristics of HLRCC histopathology. Our findings indicate that the severe compromise of oxidative phosphorylation and rapid glycolytic flux in UOK 262 are an essential feature of this TCA cycle enzyme-deficient form of kidney cancer. This tumor model is the embodiment of the Warburg effect. UOK 262 provides a unique in vitro and in vivo preclinical model for studying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer.",

     "abstract": "We report on the occurrence of an unbalanced translocation between chromosomes 1 and 16 as a single abnormality in an 81-year-old patient with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) diagnosed as refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. The derivative chromosome, causing trisomy 1q and monosomy 16q, was described on the basis of fluorescent in situ hybridization results as der(1)t(1;16)(p11;p11.1). Review of the literature showed that the der(1)t(1;16) is a rare but nonrandom abnormality in MDS, being reported to date in an additional seven MDS cases. Notably, all MDS patients carrying t(1;16) described to date are men, suggesting a putative association of this translocation with male gender in the context of MDS. The unbalanced nature of the t(1;16)(p11;p11.1) indicates that gain of 1q and/or loss of 16q might be relevant for neoplastic transformation in a subset of MDS patients.",

     "abstract": "Only a few karyotypes of neurofibromas have been documented in the literature. In this report, we describe two new cases in which conventional cytogenetics demonstrated the presence of abnormal clones. Combining karyotypes of the nine previously reported cases, we found that the most frequent structural rearrangements involved chromosome 9p. Including the two cases reported here, 5/11 cases involved 9p, and four of these involved the 9p21\u223cp22 region.",

     "abstract": "Amplified MYCN, common in neuroblastomas, can be detected as double minutes (dmin) or homogenously staining chromosomal regions (hsr). Expulsion of amplified MYCN has only been described in dmin. We used hydroxyurea (HU), which accelerates the expulsion of amplified genes and cytostatics (used in neuroblastoma therapy), to describe MYCN amplification changes after chemotherapy. We used IMR-32, SK-N-AS, UKF-NB-2, UKF-NB-3, UKF-NB-4, and derived sublines resistant to doxorubicin, cisplatin, and vincristine. The loss of amplified MYCN copies was investigated using comparative genomic hybridization and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. We found expulsion of amplified MYCN from hsr in UKF-NB-4 and IMR-32 cell lines, and determined the exact number of amplified MYCN copies. After the first cultivation with HU, some amplified MYCN was lost. UKF-NB-4 lost 20 copies on average, and IMR-32 lost 15 copies (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After the second cultivation, cells without MYCN amplification were found. In comparison to sensitive cell lines, drug-resistant cell lines lost 17 copies on\u00a0average. Our data show that expulsion of amplified MYCN genes is also possible from hsr and may be induced, not only by HU, but by other cytostatics as well.",

     "abstract": "The t(16;21)(q24;q22), a rare chromosomal translocation involving chromosome 21 in de novo and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (AML), produces a RUNX1\u2013CBFA2T3 fusion gene (previously AML1\u2013MTG16) fusion gene. The translocation has been reported in 20 patients with AML, with eosinophilia present in 3 cases. Here we report a pediatric case of t(16;21)(q24;q22) in de novo AML with eosinophilia and suggest that eosinophilia is a hematologic characteristic of at least a subpopulation of AML with t(16;21)(q24;q22). A 4-year-old Korean girl was admitted with complaints of pale appearance and dizziness, and was diagnosed with acute myelomonocytic leukemia. On admission, laboratory evaluation revealed hemoglobin at 3.3 g/dL, platelets at 9.0 \u00d7 109/L, and white blood cells at 9.1 \u00d7 109/L with 10% eosinophils and 1% blasts. The bone marrow aspirate contained 31% blasts and 11% eosinophils. Flow cytometric analysis revealed the expression of CD13, CD14, CD19, CD33, CD34, and HLA-DR by the leukemic blasts. The karyotype was 47,XX, + 8,t(16;21)(q24;q22)[18]/46,XX[2]. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis with a dual-color, dual-fusion translocation LSI AML1/ETO probe set for RUNX1 and RUNX1T1 produced three signals for each probe in 90% of interphases, but no fusion signals. We confirmed the presence of RUNX1\u2013CBFA2T3 fusion transcripts with reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction, using primers AML1ex5f1 and MTG16r2.",
