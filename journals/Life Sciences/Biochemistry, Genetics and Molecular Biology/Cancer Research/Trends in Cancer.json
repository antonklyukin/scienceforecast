An implicit assumption behind this enthusiasm is that the lack of reproducibly identified targets can be attributed to limitations of RNAi technologies.

Immunodeficient mice xenografted with human cancer cell lines have been at the foundation of in vivo cancer research for several decades, providing ground for the regulatory approval of multiple chemotherapeutics and targeted anticancer agents, but are intrinsically unsuitable for studying tumor immunology and immunotherapy. Similarly, patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) established in immunodeficient mice are not subjected to immunosurveillance by the host, although (depending on the protocol employed for PDX generation) some components of the patient\u2019s immune system may also be transferred to the mouse and be active, at least for some time. Considerable efforts are being devoted to the generation of humanized mice to circumvent these limitations. The establishment of PDXs in immunodeficient mice that are also engrafted with matched patient-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is also being investigated as a means to screen for the efficacy of (immuno)therapeutic agents in support of clinical decision making. Mouse cancer cell lines grafted subcutaneously or orthotopically in immunocompetent syngeneic hosts have been instrumental for the development of a variety of immunotherapeutics, as well as for the discovery that conventional anticancer regimens, including some forms of chemotherapy and radiation therapy, can trigger tumor-targeting immune responses. Carcinogen-driven tumors established in immunocompetent versus immunodeficient animals were critical in the early days of modern tumor immunology, as they enabled the discovery of natural anticancer immunosurveillance. Moreover, they allow for investigating the immunological versus non-immunological efficacy of anticancer (immuno)therapeutics in the context of natural immunoediting, clinically relevant immunobiological heterogeneity, and high mutation load. Transgene-driven tumors have generated in-depth insights into the crosstalk between oncogenic drivers and the tumor microenvironment, in both its immunological and non-immunological components. Each of these models is associated with specific advantages and disadvantages (see Key Facts).Figure 2. Key Features of Mouse Models for Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy. Key parameters that should be taken into careful consideration when choosing the most appropriate mouse model for the study of tumor immunology and immunotherapy include not only the immunological competence of the host (which is influenced by strain, sex, and age) and its immunological compatibility with malignant cells (which is dictated by strain), but also the mutational load of the latter, their immunological history (previous immunoediting), proliferative potential, propensity for neovascularization and metastatic dissemination, as well as their ability to generate an immunostimulatory versus immunosuppressive microenvironment. Inoculation site is also an important parameter to keep under consideration (not shown).

The aberration of integrin function is one of the well-recognized mechanisms of cancer. The activity of integrins is strongly influenced by glycans through glycosylation events and the establishment of glycan-mediated interactions. Glycans represent a class of ubiquitous biomolecules that display an extraordinary complexity and diversity in both structure and function. Widely expressed both in the ECM and on the cell surface, they play a crucial role in mediating cell proliferation, survival, and metastasis during cancer. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of how both glycosylation of integrins and integrin interaction with the cancer glyco-microenvironment can regulate cancer progression.",

The application of principles of engineering and physical sciences to oncology has provided powerful insights into the mechanisms by which these forces affect tumor progression and confer resistance to delivery and efficacy of molecular, nano-, cellular, and immuno-medicines. Here, we discuss the mechanics of the solid and fluid components of a tumor, with a focus on how they impede the transport of therapeutic agents and create an abnormal tumor microenvironment (TME) that fuels tumor progression and treatment resistance. We also present strategies to reengineer the TME by normalizing the tumor vasculature and the extracellular matrix (ECM) to improve cancer treatment. Finally, we summarize various mathematical models that have provided insights into the physical barriers to cancer treatment and revealed new strategies to overcome these barriers.",

The proposal is based on research on yeast and mammalian muscle and brain that demonstrates that the glycogen shunt functions to maintain homeostasis of glycolytic intermediates and ATP during large shifts in glucose supply or demand. Loss of the glycogen shunt leads to cell death under substrate stress. Similarities between the glycogen shunt in yeast and cancer cells lead us here to propose a parallel explanation of the lactate produced by cancer cells in the Warburg effect. The model also explains the need for the active tetramer and inactive dimer forms of pyruvate kinase (PKM2) in cancer cells, similar to the two forms of Pyk2p in yeast, as critical for regulating the glycogen shunt flux. The novel role proposed for the glycogen shunt implicates the high activities of glycogen synthase and fructose bisphosphatase in tumors as potential targets for therapy.",

Mitochondrial STAT3, FER/FER-T, and CHCHD2 are also implicated in OXPHOS.

Differences in socioeconomic status and health-care access play a key role. However, the lesser disease susceptibility of Hispanic populations with comparable lifestyles and socioeconomic status as African Americans (Hispanic paradox) points to the concomitant importance of genetic determinants. Here, we overview the molecular basis of racial disparity in cancer susceptibility ranging from genetic polymorphisms and cancer-driver gene mutations to obesity, chronic inflammation, and immune responses.

How CaM interacts with K-Ras and how this stimulates cell proliferation are among the most challenging questions in KRAS-driven cancers. Earlier data pointed to the formation of a ternary complex consisting of K-Ras, phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase \u03b1 (PI3K\u03b1), and CaM. Recent data indicate that phosphorylated CaM binds to the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the p85 subunit of PI3K\u03b1 and activates it. Modeling suggests that the high-affinity interaction between the phosphorylated CaM tyrosine motif and PI3K\u03b1 can promote full PI3K\u03b1 activation by oncogenic K-Ras. This review discusses the role of CaM in PI3K signaling at the membrane in KRAS-driven cancers. This is significant because it may help the development of K-Ras-specific pharmacology.",

The loss of stability and fidelity in the genome caused by cancer and cancer treatment provides therapeutic opportunities to leverage the critical balance between DNA injury and repair. Blocking repair and pushing damaged DNA through the cell cycle using therapeutic inhibitors exemplify the \u2018pushmi-pullyu\u2019 effect of disrupted DNA repair. DNA repair inhibitors (DNARi) can be separated into five biofunctional categories: sensors, mediators, transducers, effectors, and collaborators that recognize DNA damage, propagate injury DNA messages, regulate cell cycle checkpoints, and alter the microenvironment. The result is cancer therapeutics that takes advantage of clinical synthetic lethality, resulting in selective tumor cell kill. Here, we review recent considerations related to DNA repair and new DNARi agents and organize those findings to address future directions and clinical opportunities.",

Such cells are generally present in poorly vascularized tumor areas, show limited sensitivity to traditional chemotherapeutical drugs, and tend to resume proliferation, resulting in tumor reseeding and growth.

This newly gained knowledge provides a wealth of opportunity for biomarker-driven clinical research. To date, however, only few of the available molecular markers truly influence clinical decision-making and treatment. The most widely validated markers in neuro-oncology presently are: (i) MGMT promoter methylation as a prognostic and predictive marker in glioblastoma; (ii) codeletion of 1p and 19q differentiating oligodendrogliomas from astrocytomas; (iii) IDH1/2 mutations; and (iv) select pathway-associated mutations.

Understanding the biological underpinnings of TKI resistance is key to the successful development of future therapeutic strategies. Traditionally, mechanisms of TKI resistance have been viewed under a dichotomous lens. Tumor cells are TKI-sensitive or TKI-refractory, exhibit intrinsic or acquired resistance, and accumulate alterations within or outside the target to promote their survival. Such classifications facilitate our comprehension of an otherwise complex biology, but are likely an oversimplification. Recent studies underscore the multifaceted, genetically heterogeneous nature of TKI resistance, which evolves dynamically with changes in therapy. In this Review, we provide a broad framework for understanding the diverse mechanisms of resistance at play in oncogene-driven lung cancers.",

Cancer survivors seek the resumption of a normal and healthy life, which often includes starting a family.

Assisted reproductive technologies (ART) can address infertility, but fail to preserve the natural function of the ovaries as a source of hormones that regulate many aspects of women's health. The advancement of fertoprotective technologies is hindered by our lack of understanding of oocyte biology and their sensitivity to cancer therapies. Because many cancer treatments cause DNA damage, apoptosis is thought to be the major mechanism eliminating damaged oocytes. Indeed, recent studies in mice demonstrate that targeting proteins involved in apoptosis protects oocytes and prevents infertility in females exposed to radiation. Therefore, a better appreciation of oocyte response to radiation and anticancer drugs will uncover new targets for the development of specialized therapies to prevent ovarian failure. We make a case here for the necessity of such fertoprotective treatments. We review recent findings that have significantly advanced our understanding of how cancer therapies induce apoptotic death in oocytes, and how we could use this knowledge to design better fertoprotective treatments.",

Owing to the potential for ambient temperature to affect energy homeostasis as well as adrenergic stress, both of which could contribute to biased outcomes in murine cancer models, housing temperature should be reported in all publications and considered as a potential source of variability in results between laboratories. Researchers and regulatory agencies should work together to determine whether changes in housing parameters would enhance the use of mouse models in cancer research, as well as for other diseases.

     "abstract": "Precision medicine requires appropriate application of genomics in clinical practice. In cancer, we have witnessed practice-changing examples of how genomic knowledge is translated into more tailored and effective therapies. The next opportunity is to embed cancer genomics in clinical context so that patient-centric longitudinal clinical, genomic, and molecular phenotypes can be compiled for adaptive learning between precision medicine research and clinical care with the goal of accelerating clinically-actionable discoveries. We describe here an adaptive learning platform, APOLLO\u2122 (adaptive patient-oriented longitudinal learning and optimization) designed to integrate genomic research in the context of, but not in the path of, routine and investigational clinical care for purposes of enabling data-driven discovery across disciplines such that every patient can contribute to and potentially benefit from research discoveries.",

     "abstract": "Blood-borne metastasis accounts for the vast majority of cancer-related deaths and it is fueled by the generation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from a primary tumor deposit. Recent technological advances have made it possible to characterize human CTCs as they travel within the bloodstream. CTCs are found both as single cells and as clusters of cells held together by intercellular junctions. Although less prevalent, CTC clusters appear to have greater metastatic potential than single CTCs in the circulation. Both may exhibit shifts in expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers, which may show dynamic changes during cancer progression. In this review we discuss recent insights into the biological properties of individual and clustered cancer cells in the circulation.",

     "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) are commonly deregulated in the pathogenesis of human cancer and are a major class of cancer cell dependencies. Consequently, targeting of TFs can be highly effective in treating particular malignancies, as highlighted by the clinical efficacy of agents that target nuclear hormone receptors. In this review we discuss recent advances in our understanding of TFs as drug targets in oncology, with an emphasis on the emerging chemical approaches to modulate TF function. The remarkable diversity and potency of TFs as drivers of cell transformation justifies a continued pursuit of TFs as therapeutic targets for drug discovery.",

     "abstract": "Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have been extensively used to eradicate cancer based on their direct cytocidal effects on rapidly proliferating tumor cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that these therapies also dramatically affect resident and recruited immune cells that actively support tumor growth. We now appreciate that mobilization of effector CD8+ T cells enhances the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy; remarkable clinical advances have been achieved by blocking regulatory programs limiting cytotoxic CD8+ T cell activity. This review discusses immune-mediated mechanisms underlying the efficacy of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and provides a perspective on how understanding tissue-based immune mechanisms can be used to guide therapeutic approaches combining immune and cytotoxic therapies to improve outcomes for a larger subset of patients than is currently achievable.",

     "abstract": "The clinical manifestation of metastasis in a vital organ is the final stage of cancer progression and the main culprit of cancer-related mortality. Once established, metastasis is devastating, but only a small proportion of the cancer cells that leave a tumor succeed at infiltrating, surviving, and ultimately overtaking a distant organ. The bottlenecks that challenge cancer cells in newly invaded microenvironments are organ-specific and consequently demand distinct mechanisms for metastatic colonization. We review the metastatic traits that allow cancer cells to colonize distinct organ sites.",
