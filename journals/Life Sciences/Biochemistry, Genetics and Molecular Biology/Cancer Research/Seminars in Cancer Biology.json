     "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents the most common type of head and neck cancer worldwide. However, despite advances in cancer care globally there has been little progress in HNSCC, with survival remaining static and slightly worse in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with 5\u2009year survivals remaining at \u223c50%. Conventional analysis of tissue through cytopathology or histopathology are the mainstay of diagnosis. Furthermore there are no useful biomarkers for disease diagnosis or surveillance. With recent technological advances, particularly in next generation sequencing, here we explore the application of tumor DNA for HNSCC diagnosis and surveillance, to improve surgical margin analysis and the potential use of molecular agents aiding in the imaging of HNSCC.",

     "abstract": "Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney cancer, comprising approximately 75% of all kidney tumors. Recent the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) studies have significantly advanced the molecular characterization of RCC and facilitated the development of targeted therapies. Such advances have improved the median survival of patients with advanced disease from less than 10 months prior to 2004 to 30 months by 2011. However, approximately 30% of localized ccRCC patients will nevertheless develop recurrence or metastasis after surgical resection of their tumor. Therefore, it is critical to further analyze potential tumor-associated proteins and their profiles during disease progression. Over the past decade, tremendous effort has been focused on the study of molecular pathways, including genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics in order to identify potential molecular biomarkers, as well as to facilitate early detection, monitor tumor progression and uncover potentially therapeutic targets. In this review, we focus on recent advances in the proteomic analysis of ccRCC, current strategies and challenges, and perspectives in the field. This insight will highlight the discovery of tumor-associated proteins, and their potential clinical impact on personalized precision-based care in ccRCC.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Similar to many other malignancies, CRC is a heterogeneous disease, making it a clinical challenge for optimization of treatment modalities in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. A more precise understanding of the biological properties that distinguish patients with colorectal tumors, especially in terms of their clinical features, is a key requirement towards a more robust, targeted-drug design, and implementation of individualized therapies. In the recent decades, extensive studies have reported distinct CRC subtypes, with a mutation-centered view of tumor heterogeneity. However, more recently, the paradigm has shifted towards transcriptome-based classifications, represented by six independent CRC taxonomies. In 2015, the colorectal cancer subtyping consortium reported the identification of four consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs), providing thus far the most robust classification system for CRC. In this review, we summarize the historical timeline of CRC classification approaches; discuss their salient features and potential limitations that may require further refinement in near future. In other words, in spite of the recent encouraging progress, several major challenges prevent translation of molecular knowledge gleaned from CMSs into the clinic. Herein, we summarize some of these potential challenges and discuss exciting new opportunities currently emerging in related fields. We believe, close collaborations between basic researchers, bioinformaticians and clinicians are imperative for addressing these challenges, and eventually paving the path for CRC subtyping into routine clinical practice as we usher into the era of personalized medicine.",

Replication stress generates DNA damage not only during S phase, but also in the subsequent mitosis, where it impacts adversely on chromosome segregation. Some regions of the genome seem particularly sensitive to replication stress-induced instability; most notably, chromosome fragile sites. In this article, we review some of the important issues that have emerged in recent years concerning DNA replication stress and fragile site expression, as well as how chromosome instability is minimized by a family of ring-shaped protein complexes known as SMC proteins. Understanding how replication stress impacts on S phase and mitosis in cancer should provide opportunities for the development of novel and tumour-specific treatments.",

Nevertheless, the lack of sensitive biomarkers and presence of biological heterogeneity precludes its early detection and effective treatment. The recent introduction of next-generation sequencing allows characterization of multiple driver mutations at genome- and exome-wide levels. Sequencing of DNA and RNA from circulating tumour cells has also opened an exciting era of non-invasive procedures for tumour detection and prognostication. This massively-parallel sequencing technology has uncovered the previously obscure molecular mechanisms, providing clues for better stratification of patients and identification of druggable targets for the disease. Identification of active oncogenic pathways and gene-gene interactions may reveal oncogene addiction and synthetic lethality. Relevant findings can be extrapolated to develop targeted and personalized therapeutic interventions. In addition to known mutational events, the role of chromosomal rearrangements in pancreatic neoplasms is gradually uncovered. Coupled with bioinformatics pipelines and epidemiological analyses, a better framework for risk stratification and prognostication of pancreatic cancer will be possible in the near future. In this review, we discuss how translational genomic studies facilitate our understanding of pathobiology, and development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma with emphases on whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and liquid biopsies.

As such, detection of aberrant DNA methylation is being developed as biomarkers for prognostic and diagnostic purposes in gastrointestinal cancers. Diverse tissue types are suitable for the analyses of methylated DNA, such as tumor tissues, blood, plasma, and stool, and some of these markers are already utilized in the clinical setting.

Landmark studies contributing to these projects have revealed alterations in cell signaling cascades that vary between cancer types and within tumors themselves. We review several of these studies in major tumor types to highlight recent advances in our understanding of the role of (RTK)-RAS-RAF alterations in cancer.

The (RTK)-RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK mutation status, and their prognostic value, are also examined and correlated with clinical phenotypes. Treatments targeting various components of this pathway are ongoing, and are often effective initially in defined subgroups of patients.

     "abstract": "Ras oncoproteins play pivotal roles in both the development and maintenance of many tumor types. Unfortunately, these proteins are difficult to directly target using traditional pharmacological strategies, in part due to their lack of obvious binding pockets or allosteric sites. This obstacle has driven a considerable amount of research into pursuing alternative ways to effectively inhibit Ras, examples of which include inducing mislocalization to prevent Ras maturation and inactivating downstream proteins in Ras-driven signaling pathways. Ras proteins are archetypes of a superfamily of small GTPases that play specific roles in the regulation of many cellular processes, including vesicle trafficking, nuclear transport, cytoskeletal rearrangement, and cell cycle progression. Several other superfamily members have also been linked to the control of normal and cancer cell growth and survival. For example, Rap1 has high sequence similarity to Ras, has overlapping binding partners, and has been demonstrated to both oppose and mimic Ras-driven cancer phenotypes. Rap1 plays an important role in cell adhesion and integrin function in a variety of cell types. Mechanistically, Ras and Rap1 cooperate to initiate and sustain ERK signaling, which is activated in many malignancies and is the target of successful therapeutics. Here we review the role activated Rap1 in ERK signaling and other downstream pathways to promote invasion and cell migration and metastasis in various cancer types.",

The incidence of PDAC is expected to increase, at least partially because of the obesity epidemic. Increased efforts to prevent or intercept this disease are clearly needed. Mutations in KRAS are initiating events in pancreatic carcinogenesis supported by genetically engineered mouse models of the disease. However, oncogenic KRAS is not entirely sufficient for the development of fully invasive PDAC. Additional genetic mutations and/or environmental, nutritional, and metabolic stressors, e.g. inflammation and obesity, are required for efficient PDAC formation with activation of KRAS downstream effectors. Multiple factors \u201cupstream\u201d of KRAS associated with obesity, including insulin resistance, inflammation, changes in gut microbiota and GI peptides, can enhance/modulate downstream signals. Multiple signaling networks and feedback loops \u201cdownstream\u201d of KRAS have been described that respond to obesogenic diets. We propose that KRAS mutations potentiate a signaling network that is promoted by environmental factors. Specifically, we envisage that KRAS mutations increase the intensity and duration of the growth-promoting signaling network.

Constitutive activating mutations in RAS genes are found in up to 30% of human cancers, and remarkably, the oncogenic Ras mutations and mutations in other components of Ras/MAPK signaling pathways seem to be mutually exclusive in most tumors, pointing out that deregulation of Ras-dependent signaling is an essential requirement for tumorigenesis. Up to 30% of solid tumors are known to have a mutated (abnormal) KRAS gene. Unfortunately, patients harboring mutated KRAS CRC are unlikely to benefit from anti-EGFR therapy. Moreover, it remains unclear that patients with KRAS wild-type CRC will definitely respond to such therapies. Although some clinically designed-strategies to modulate KRAS aberrant activation have been designed, all attempts to target KRAS have failed in the clinical assays and K-RAS has been assumed to be invulnerable to chemotherapeutic attack. Recently, different encouraging publications reported that ascorbate may have a selective antitumoral effect on KRAS mutant cancer cells.In this review we aim to describe the prevalence and importance of KRAS mutation in cancer and associated problems for the clinical handling of patients harboring these tumors. We highlight the role of mutated KRAS in boosting and keeping the tumor associated aberrant cell metabolism stating that further in-depth studies on the molecular mechanism of ascorbate to bypass mutated KRAS-related metabolic alterations may constitute a new pathway to design novel molecules in order handle tumor resistance to anti EGFR-therapies.",

Previous studies have improved the understanding of Ras structure, processing, and signaling pathways in cancer cells and have opened new possibilities for inhibiting Ras function. In this review we discuss the most recent advances towards inhibiting Ras activity with small molecules, highlighting the two approaches: (i) compounds that bind directly to Ras protein and (ii) inhibitors of the enzymes involved in the post-translational modifications of Ras. In the former, we analyze the most recent contributions in each of the main classes of Ras direct binders, including the different types of nucleotide exchange inhibitors, allosteric compounds, and molecules that interfere with the interaction between Ras and its effectors. In the latter, we examine the compounds that inhibit Ras activation by blocking any of its post-translational modifications. Also, a special focus is made on those molecules that have progressed the farthest from medicinal chemistry and drug development points of view. Finally, the current scene regarding the clinical trials of Ras inhibitors, together with the future promising avenues for further development of the challenging Ras field are reviewed.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer is considered among the most aggressive and the least curable of all human malignancies. It is usually characterized by multiple aberrations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, most notably activating mutations in KRAS. This review examines the various attempts that have been made to inhibit Kras and its downstream signaling pathways in pancreatic cancer with an emphasis on challenges related to clinical trials. Attempts include preventing the localization of Ras protein to the plasma membrane, inhibiting downstream oncogenic signaling by targeting Kras effectors such as MEK1/2, Erk1/2 or Akt singly or in combination, and directly inhibiting Kras protein. Most clinical trials have focused on inhibiting downstream effector pathways and clinical benefit has been limited due to compensatory mechanisms and toxicity associated with small therapeutic windows. Additionally, genetic screens have been conducted to identify gene or genes that could provide therapeutic vulnerabilities in mutant KRAS cells and provide a way to target mutant Kras protein only. We also discuss how potentially transforming clinical trials have failed in the past and what new strategies are on-going in clinical trials for pancreas cancer. For long-term success in targeting Kras, future efforts should focus on combinatorial strategies to more effectively block Kras pathways at multiple points, and improve translational application of pre-clinical data to the clinic.",

     "abstract": "Ras signaling initiates at the plasma membrane. Thus, Ras behavior at the membrane and how it relates to its interactions with Raf and PI3K\u03b1, are of immense interest. Here we review factors influencing Ras lateral diffusion. We then ask whether oncogenic Ras diffusion speed in the membrane is important for signaling response times and whether it affects ubiquitously all pathways. We suggest that if Ras expression is sufficiently high to dimerize (or form nanoclusters), signaling response of those pathways where dimers (or nanoclusters) are involved corresponds to the speed with which Ras molecules travel in the membrane. On average, the faster the rate at which Ras travels to dimerize, the shorter the time to MAPK signaling; but not PI3K\u03b1. However, we argue that KRas speed may not play an important functional role because changes in mobility at this scale are unlikely to be significant. In line with this, despite the anchors\u2019 variability, lateral diffusion speeds of KRas and HRas are similar, as is that of Lck kinase; however, even though with similar anchor, Cdc42 mobility presents a different pattern, commensurate with its role in the positioning of the apical domain, suggesting that mobility evolved for function.",

Both pathways are needed in KRAS-driven proliferation. Here we ask: Is oncogenic KRas nanoclustering (or dimerization) essential for all KRas signaling pathways? Raf kinase domain dimerization, thus MAPK activation, requires KRas nanoclusters. By contrast, the PI3K\u03b1 heterodimer acts as a monomeric unit; thus, does PI3K\u03b1 activation and PI3K\u03b1/Akt/mTOR signaling require nanoclustering? Further, calmodulin binds only to oncogenic KRas4B. Here we ask: Does calmodulin downregulate KRas4B cancer development as suggested early on, or promote it? We also ask: Why is oncogenic KRas4B the most abundant isoform? Does wild-type Ras indeed inhibit its oncogenic variants as data appeared to suggest? And related to the last question, why is wild-type KRas a more potent inhibitor of its oncogenic form than wild-type NRas of its oncogenic form? Resolving these cardinal questions, and others, such as how exactly does RASSF5 (NORE1A) act as tumor suppressor, and why Ras isoforms tend to occur in distinct cancer types are crucial for effective pharmacology. In this review, we take a nanoclustering/dimerization-centric outlook and show that many questions can be explained by simply considering Ras nanoclustering.",

Seminal early research in RAS biology uncovered the basic paradigm of post-translational isoprenylation of RAS polypeptides, typically with covalent attachment of a farnesyl group, leading to isoprenyl-mediated RAS anchorage at the plasma membrane and signal initiation at those sites. However, the failure of farnesyltransferase inhibitors to translate to the clinic stymied anti-RAS therapy development. Over the past ten years, a more complete picture has emerged of RAS protein maturation, intracellular trafficking, and location, positioning and retention in subdomains at the plasma membrane, with a corresponding expansion in our understanding of how these properties of RAS contribute to signal outputs. Each of these aspects of RAS regulation presents a potential vulnerability in RAS function that may be exploited for therapeutic targeting, and inhibitors have been identified or developed that interfere with RAS for nearly all of them.

However, mutant Ras remains a challenging therapeutic target. Similarly, inhibition of targets upstream and downstream of Ras has shown limited clinical utility. There have been attempts to develop and deliver mutant K-Ras silencing RNAs either through their encapsulation in liposomes or nanoparticles. However, these approaches show very limited success due to the lack of stability of such carrier molecules alongside associated toxicity. There is a pressing need for the identification of better therapeutic targets for Ras or its associated pathways as well as improvements in the design of superior RNAi delivery systems to suppress mutant K-Ras.

Fast forward a decade, considerable new knowledge has emerged in the area of small vesicles, microparticles, and exosomes. Exosomes are tiny vesicles and play a significant role in regulating cancer-related signaling pathways. Exosomes have also been studied as delivery vehicles to transport drugs, proteins, and microRNAs of choice for therapeutic purposes. K-Ras pathway proteins have been implicated in exosome biogenesis and extravasation processes. This review provides an update on the current knowledge related to K-Ras signaling and exosomes and also discusses how these tiny vesicles can be harnessed to successfully deliver the K-Ras silencing moieties.",

     "abstract": "Life starts with a zygote, which is formed by the fusion of a haploid sperm and egg. The formation of a blastomere by cleavage division (nuclear division without an increase in cell size) is the first step in embryogenesis, after the formation of the zygote. Blastomeres are responsible for reprogramming the parental genome as a new embryonic genome for generation of the pluripotent stem cells which then differentiate by Waddington\u2019s epigenetic landscape to create a new life. Multiple authors over the past 150 years have proposed that tumors arises from development gone awry at a point within Waddington\u2019s landscape. Recent discoveries showing that differentiated somatic cells can be reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem cells, and that somatic cell nuclear transfer can be used to successfully clone animals, have fundamentally reshaped our understanding of tumor development and origin. Differentiated somatic cells are plastic and can be induced to dedifferentiate into pluripotent stem cells. Here, I review the evidence that suggests somatic cells may have a previously overlooked endogenous embryonic program that can be activated to dedifferentiate somatic cells into stem cells of various potencies for tumor initiation. Polyploid giant cancer cells (PGCCs) have long been observed in cancer and were thought originally to be nondividing. Contrary to this belief, recent findings show that stress-induced PGCCs divide by endoreplication, which may recapitulate the pattern of cleavage-like division in blastomeres and lead to dedifferentiation of somatic cells by a programmed process known as \u201cthe giant cell cycle\u201d, which comprise four distinct but overlapping phases: initiation, self-renewal, termination and stability. Depending on the intensity and type of stress, different levels of dedifferentiation result in the formation of tumors of different grades of malignancy. Based on these results, I propose a unified dualistic model to demonstrate the origin of human tumors. The tenet of this model includes four points, as follows. 1. Tumors originate from a stem cell at a specific developmental hierarchy, which can be achieved by dualistic origin: dedifferentiation of the zygote formed by two haploid gametes (sexual reproduction) via the blastomere during normal development, or transformation from damaged or aged mature somatic cells via a blastomere-like embryonic program (asexual reproduction). 2. Initiation of the tumor begins with a stem cell that has uncoupled the differentiation from the proliferation program which results in stem cell maturation arrest. 3. The developmental hierarchy at which stem cells arrest determines the degree of malignancy: the more primitive the level at which stem cells arrest, the greater the likelihood of the tumor being malignant. 4. Environmental factors and intrinsic genetic or epigenetic alterations represent the risk factors or stressors that facilitate stem cell arrest and somatic cell dedifferentiation. However, they, per se, are not the driving force of tumorigenesis. Thus, the birth of a tumor can be viewed as a triad that originates from a stem cell via dedifferentiation through a blastomere or blastomere-like program, which then differentiates along Waddington\u2019s landscape, and arrests at a developmental hierarchy. Blocking the PGCC-mediated dedifferentiation process and inducing their differentiation may represent a novel alternative approach to eliminate the tumor occurrence and therapeutic resistance.",

In this scenario, increasing scientific evidences demonstrate that the activation of human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) is involved in the aggressiveness of tumors such as melanoma, breast, germ cell, renal, ovarian, liver and haematological cancers. In their dynamic regulation, HERVs have also proved to be important determinants of pluripotency in human embryonic stem cells (ESC) and of the reprogramming process of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). In many types of tumors, essential characteristics of aggressiveness have been associated with the achievement of stemness features, often accompanied with the identification of defined subpopulations, termed cancer stem cells (CSCs), which possess stem cell-like properties and sustain tumorigenesis. Indeed, CSCs show high self-renewal capacity with a peculiar potential in tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, heterogeneity, recurrence, radiotherapy and drug resistance. However, HERVs role in CSCs biology is still not fully elucidated. In this regard, CD133 is a widely recognized marker of CSCs, and our group demonstrated, for the first time, the requirement of HERV-K activation to expand and maintain a CD133+ melanoma cell subpopulation with stemness features in response to microenvironmental modifications.

     "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are subpopulations of multipotent stem cells (SCs) responsible for the initiation, long-term clonal maintenance, growth and spreading of most human neoplasms. Reportedly, CSCs share a very robust DNA damage response (DDR) with embryonic and adult SCs, which allows them to survive endogenous and exogenous genotoxins. A range of experimental evidence indicates that CSCs have high but heterogeneous levels of replication stress (RS), arising from, and being boosted by, endogenous causes, such as specific genetic backgrounds (e.g., p53 deficiency) and/or aberrant karyotypes (e.g., supernumerary chromosomes). A multipronged RS response (RSR) is put in place by CSCs to limit and ensure tolerability to RS. The characteristics of such dedicated cascade have two opposite consequences, both relevant for cancer therapy. On the one hand, RSR efficiency often increases the reliance of CSCs on specific DDR components. On the other hand, the functional redundancy of pathways of the RSR can paradoxically promote the acquisition of resistance to RS- and/or DNA damage-inducing agents. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular mechanisms of the RSR in cancer cells and CSCs, focusing on the role of CHK1 and some emerging players, such as PARP1 and components of the homologous recombination repair, whose targeting can represent a long-term effective anti-CSC strategy.",

     "abstract": "Most tumors exhibit intra-tumor heterogeneity, which is associated with disease progression and an impaired response to therapy. Cancer cell plasticity has been proposed as being an important mechanism that, along with genetic and epigenetic alterations, promotes cancer cell diversity and contributes to intra-tumor heterogeneity. Plasticity endows cancer cells with the capacity to shift dynamically between a differentiated state, with limited tumorigenic potential, and an undifferentiated or cancer stem-like cell (CSC) state, which is responsible for long-term tumor growth. In addition, it confers the ability to transit into distinct CSC states with different competence to invade, disseminate and seed metastasis. Cancer cell plasticity has been linked to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and relies not only on cell-autonomous mechanisms, but also on signals provided by the tumor microenvironment and/or induced in response to therapy. We provide an overview of the dynamic transition for cancer cell states, the mechanisms governing cell plasticity and their impact on tumor progression, metastasis and therapy response. Understanding the mechanisms involved in cancer cell plasticity will provide insights for establishing new therapeutic interventions.",

Differences in the stem cell pool size and in mechanisms regulating stemness in the different breast cancer subtypes have emerged.

CTAs are multifunctional protein group with specific expression patterns in normal embryonic and adult cells and various types of cancer cells. CTAs are involved in regulating of the basic cellular processes during development, stem cell differentiation and carcinogenesis though the biological roles and cell functions of CTA families remain largely unclear. Analysis of CTA expression patterns in embryonic germ and somatic cells, pluripotent and multipotent stem cells, cancer stem cells and their cell descendants indicates that rearrangements of characteristic CTA profiles (aberrant expression) could be associated with cancer transformation and failure of the developmental program of cell lineage specification and germ line restriction. Therefore, aberrant CTA profiles can be used as panels of biomarkers for diagnoses and the selection of cancer treatment strategies. Moreover, immunogenic CTAs are prospective targets for cancer immunotherapy. Clinical trials testing broad range of cancer therapeutic vaccines against antigens of MAGEA and NY-ESO-1 families for treating various cancers have shown mixed clinical efficiency, safety and tolerability, suggesting the requirement of in-depth research of CTA expression in normal and cancer stem cells and extensive clinical trials for improving cancer immunotherapy technologies. This review focuses on recent advancement in study of CTAs in normal and cancer cells, particularly in normal and cancer stem cells, and provides a new insight into CTA expression patterns during normal and cancer stem cell lineage development.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) gained fast attention as a minor population of highly malignant cells within liquid and solid tumors that are responsible for tumor onset, self-renewal, resistance to radio- and chemotherapies, and evasion of immune surveillance accelerating recurrence and metastasis. Recent progress in the identification of their phenotypic and molecular characteristics and interactions with the tumor microenvironment provides great potential for the development of CSC-based targeted therapies and radical improvement in metastasis prevention and cancer patient prognosis. Here, we report on newly uncovered signaling mechanisms controlling CSC\u2019s aggressiveness and treatment resistance, and CSC-specific agents and molecular therapeutics, some of which are currently under investigation in clinical trials, gearing towards decisive functional CSC intrinsic or surface markers. One special research focus rests upon subverted regulatory pathways such as insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor signaling and its interactors in metastasis-initiating cell populations directly related to the gain of stem cell- and EMT-associated properties, as well as key components of the E2F transcription factor network regulating metastatic progression, microenvironmental changes, and chemoresistance. In addition, the study provides insight into systems biology tools to establish complex molecular relationships behind the emergence of aggressive phenotypes from high-throughput data that rely on network-based analysis and their use to investigate immune escape mechanisms or predict clinical outcome-relevant CSC receptor signaling signatures. We further propose that customized vector technologies could drastically enhance systemic drug delivery to target sites, and summarize recent progress and remaining challenges. This review integrates available knowledge on CSC biology, computational modeling approaches, molecular targeting strategies, and delivery techniques to envision future clinical therapies designed to conquer metastasis-initiating cells.",

     "abstract": "Iron is an essential nutrient that facilitates cell proliferation and growth. Iron can be detrimental, however. The ability of iron to cycle between oxidized and reduced forms contributes to the formation of free radicals. An excess of free radicals leads to lipid peroxidation, more reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, damage to DNA and other biomolecules, and, if potentially, tumorigenesis. Iron also has a role in the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment and in metastasis. Pathways of iron acquisition, efflux, storage, and regulation are all perturbed in cancer, suggesting that reprogramming of iron metabolism is a central aspect of tumor cell survival. Recent studies have shed light on the role of iron metabolism in cancer stem cells (CSC) and suggest that specific targeting of iron metabolism in CSCs may improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. In this review, we first summarize briefly our current understanding of the intracellular processes involving iron, the effect of dietary iron, and its relation to cancer.

Recent reports support the central importance of a cancer stem cell-like niche that appears to help foster the generation and maintenance of CSCs. In response to signals provided by this microenvironment, CSCs express the tumorigenic characteristics that can drive tumor metastasis by the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) that in turn fosters the migration and recolonization of the cells as secondary tumors within metastatic niches. We summarize here recent advances in cancer stem cell research including the characterization of their genetic and epigenetic features, metabolic specialities, and crosstalk with aging-associated processes. Potential strategies for targeting CSCs, and their niche, by regulating CSCs plasticity, or therapeutic sensitivity is discussed.

Effective tumor therapy requires the eradication of CSC as they can support regrowth of the tumor resulting in recurrence.

Therapy resistance is mediated by the acquisition of dormancy, increased DNA repair and drug efflux capacity, decreased apoptosis as well as the interaction between CSC and their supporting microenvironment, the CSC niche.

Since many conventional therapeutic strategies, including chemotherapy and radiotherapy remain fairly unsuccessful in treating CSCs/poorly differentiated tumors, there has been an increasing interest in NK cell-targeted immunotherapy for the treatment of aggressive tumors. In our recent studies, we used humanized-BLT (hu-BLT) mouse model with transplanted human bone marrow, liver and thymus to demonstrate the efficacy of adoptive transfer of ex vivo expanded, super-charged NK cells in selection and differentiation of stem-like tumors within the context of a fully reconstituted human immune system. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that CSCs differentiated with split-anergized NK cells prior to implantation in hu-BLT mice were not able to grow or metastasize. However, when NK cell-mediated tumor differentiation was blocked by the addition of antibodies to IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, tumors grew and metastasized. In this review, we present current advances in NK cell expansion and therapeutic delivery, and discuss the utility of allogeneic super-charged NK cells in treatment of cancer patients. In addition, NK suppression occurs not only at the stage of overt cancer, but also at the pre-neoplastic stage.

They can drive the neoplastic growth and recurrence, even after long latency.

However, GBM molecular subtypes have not led to improvement of patients outcomes. Targeted or tailored therapies for specific mutations or subtypes largely failed due to the complexities arising from intratumoral molecular heterogeneity. Most tumors develop resistance to treatment and soon recur. GBM stem cells (GSCs) have been identified. Recent single cell sequencing studies of GBM suggest that intratumoral cellular heterogeneity can be partially explained by tumor cell hierarchy arising from GBM stem cells. Therefore, the molecular subtypes based on patient derived GSCs may potentially lead to more effective subtype-specific treatments.

While PDAC currently represents the 4th most frequent cause of death due to cancer worldwide, it is expected to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. These alarming statistics are primarily due to both the inherent chemoresistant and metastatic nature of this tumor, and the existence of a subpopulation of highly plastic \u201cstem\u201d-like cells within the tumor, known as cancer stem cells (CSCs). Since their discovery in PDAC in 2007, we have come to realize that pancreatic CSCs have unique metabolic, autophagic, invasive, and chemoresistance properties that allow them to continuously self-renew and escape chemo-therapeutic elimination. More importantly, the concept of the CSC as a fixed entity within the tumor has also evolved, and current data suggest that CSCs are states rather than defined entities. Consequently, current treatments for the majority of PDAC patients are not effective, and do not significantly impact overall patient survival, as they do not adequately target the plastic CSC sub-population nor the transient/hybrid cells that can replenish the CSC pool. Thus, it is necessary that we improve our understanding of the characteristics and signals that maintain and drive the pancreatic CSC population in order to develop new therapies to target these cells. Herein, we will provide the latest updates and knowledge on the inherent characteristics of pancreatic CSCs and the CSC niche, specifically the cross-talk that exists between CSCs and niche resident cells. Lastly, we will address the question of whether a CSC is a state or an entity and discuss how the answer to this question can impact treatment approaches.",

These aspects are currently under intense investigation. In the framework of the oncogenic signaling pathways controlled by microRNAs (miRNAs) during CRC development, a plethora of data suggests that miRNAs can play a key role in several regulatory pathways involving CSCs biology, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), angiogenesis, metastatization, and pharmacoresistance.This review examines the most relevant evidences about the role of miRNAs in the etiology of CRC, through the regulation of colon CSCs and the principal differences between colorectal CSCs and benign stem cells. In this perspective, the utility of the principal CSCs-related miRNAs changes is explored, emphasizing their use as potential biomarkers to aid in diagnosis, prognosis and predicting response to therapy in CRC patients, but also as promising targets for more effective and personalized anti-CRC treatments.",

     "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a sub-population of tumour cells, which are responsible to drive tumour growth, metastasis and therapy resistance. It has recently been proposed that enhanced glucose metabolism and immune evasion by tumour cells are linked, and are modulated by the changing tumour microenvironment (TME) that creates a competition for nutrient consumption between tumour and different sub-types of cells attracted to the TME. To facilitate efficient nutrient distribution, oncogene-induced inflammatory milieu in the tumours facilitate adaptive metabolic changes in the surrounding non-malignant cells to secrete metabolites that are used as alternative nutrient sources by the tumours to sustain its increasing energy needs for growth and anabolic functions. This scenario also affects CSCs residing at the primary or metastatic niches. This review summarises recent advances in our understanding of the metabolic phenotypes of cancer cells and CSCs and how these processes are affected by the TME. We also discuss how the evolving TME modulates tumour cells and CSCs in cancer progression. Using previously described proteomic and genomic platforms, ovarian cancer cell lines and a mouse xenograft model we highlight the existence of metabolic and immune regulatory signatures in chemoresistant ovarian CSCs, and discuss how these processes may affect recurrence in ovarian tumours. We propose that progress in cancer control and eradication may depend not only on the elimination of highly chemoresistant CSCs, but also in designing novel strategies which would intervene with the tumour-promoting TME factors.",

Considerable advances have also been made in understanding how cancers escape from immune attack. Targeting of immunological escape processes regulated by the expression of immune checkpoint receptors and ligands and the down-modulation of tumor antigen presentation is the basis of immuno-oncology treatments. Despite recent achievements, there remain a number of unresolved issues in order to successfully implement cancer immunotherapy in many cancers. Importantly, clinical biomarkers are still needed for better optimization of emerging combination immunotherapies and better treatment tailoring.

However, these agents are efficacious in only a minority of patients. Newer strategies are becoming available that target additional immunomodulatory mechanisms to activate patients\u2019 own anti-tumor immune responses.

     "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid tumor of neural crest origin. The current treatment options for neuroblastoma produce severe side effects. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), chronic inflammation, and non-coding RNAs are known to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma. Cancer cells and the surrounding cells in the tumor microenvironment express PD-L1. Programmed death-1 (PD-1) is a co-receptor expressed predominantly by T cells. The binding of PD-1 to its ligands, PD-L1 or PD-L2, is vital for the physiologic regulation of the immune system. Chronic inflammation is involved in the recruitment of leukocytes, production of cytokines and chemokines that in turn, lead to survival, metastasis, and angiogenesis in neuroblastoma tumors. The miRNAs and long non-coding (lnc) RNAs have emerged as a novel class of non-coding RNAs that can regulate neuroblastoma associated cell-signaling pathways. The dysregulation of PD-1/PD-L1, inflammatory pathways, lncRNAs, and miRNAs have been reported in clinical and experimental samples of neuroblastoma. These signaling molecules are currently being evaluated for their potential as the biomarker and therapeutic targets in the management of neuroblastoma. A monoclonal antibody called dinutuximab (Unituxin) that attaches to a carbohydrate molecule GD2, on the surface of many neuroblastoma cells, is being used as an immunotherapy drug for neuroblastoma treatment. Atezolizumab (Tecentriq), an engineered monoclonal antibody against PD-L1, are currently in clinical trial for neuroblastoma patients. The lncRNA/miRNA-based therapeutics is being developed to deliver tumor suppressor lncRNAs/miRNAs or silencing of oncogenic lncRNAs/miRNAs. The focus of this review is to discuss the current knowledge on the immune checkpoint molecules, PD-1/PD-L1 signaling, inflammation, and non-coding RNAs in neuroblastoma.",

HGPs in different tissues share certain general characteristics like the extent of angiogenesis, but also appropriate tissue-specific mechanisms which ultimately determine differences in the biology of HGP subtypes. For instance, in the well-characterized HGPs of liver metastases, the two main subtypes, replacement and desmoplastic, recapitulate two responses of the normal liver to injury: regeneration and fibrosis. HGP subtypes have distinct cytokine profiles and differing levels of lymphocytic infiltration which suggests that they are indicative of immune status in the tumor microenvironment. HGPs predict response to bevacizumab and are associated with overall survival (OS) after surgery for liver metastases in colorectal cancer (CRC). In addition, HGPs can change over time in response to therapy.

CSCs are therefore postulated as the root of therapy resistance, relapse and metastasis. Aside from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, immunotherapy is now established as the fourth pillar in the therapeutic armamentarium for patients with cancer, especially late-stage and advanced cancers. A better understanding of CSC immunological properties should lead to development of novel immunologic approaches targeting CSCs, which, in turn, may help prevent tumor recurrence and eliminate residual diseases.

In turn, immune cells in the tumor, specifically in context with an acidic and hypoxic environment, can promote neovascularization. Immunotherapy has emerged as a major therapeutic modality in cancer but is often hampered by the low influx of activated cytotoxic T-cells. On the other hand, anti-angiogenic therapy has been shown to transiently normalize the tumor vasculature and enhance infiltration of T lymphocytes, providing a rationale for a combination of these two therapeutic approaches to sustain and improve therapeutic efficacy in cancer. In this review, we discuss how the tumor vasculature facilitates an immunosuppressive phenotype and vice versa how innate and adaptive immune cells regulate angiogenesis during tumor progression.

Radiation therapy (RT) stands out as a very promising candidate for this purpose. Indeed, RT mediates antineoplastic effects not only by cytotoxic and cytostatic mechanisms, but also by modulating immunological functions, both locally (within the irradiated field) and systemically. As combinatorial regimens involving RT and ICBs are being developed and clinically tested at an accelerating pace, it is paramount to identify biomarkers that reliably predict the likelihood of individual patients to respond.

However, despite successful standardization efforts visual TIL estimation is slow, with limited precision and lacks the ability to evaluate more complex properties such as TIL distribution patterns. Therefore, computational image analysis approaches are needed to provide standardized and efficient TIL quantification. Here, we discuss different automated TIL scoring approaches ranging from classical image segmentation, where cell boundaries are identified and the resulting objects classified according to shape properties, to machine learning-based approaches that directly classify cells without segmentation but rely on large amounts of training data. In contrast to conventional machine learning (ML) approaches that are often criticized for their \"black-box\" characteristics, we also discuss explainable machine learning.

Furthermore, we describe the presence of certain groups of antigens as putative targets for treatment, evaluate the outcomes of current clinical immunotherapy trials, and finally, we propose a strategy to better implement immuno-oncological markers to guide future immune therapies in BC.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and lethal disease with a high therapeutic need. For most patients with metastatic CRC, chemotherapy is the only viable option. Currently, immunotherapy is restricted to the particular genetic subgroup of mismatch-repair deficient (MMRd)/microsatellite instable (MSI) CRC. Anti-PD1 therapy was recently FDA-approved as a second-line treatment in this subgroup. However, in a metastatic setting, these MMRd/MSI tumors are vastly outnumbered by mismatch-repair proficient (MMRp)/microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors. These MMRp/MSS tumors do not meaningfully respond to any traditional immunotherapy approach including checkpoint blockade, adoptive cell transfer and vaccination. This resistance to immunotherapy is due to a complex tumor microenvironment that counteracts antitumor immunity through a combination of poorly antigenic tumor cells and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. To find ways of overcoming immunotherapy resistance in the majority of CRC patients, it is necessary to analyze the immunological makeup in an in-depth and personalized way and in the context of their tumor genetic makeup. Flexible, biomarker-guided early-phase immunotherapy trials are needed to optimize this workflow.In this review, we detail key mechanisms for immune evasion and emerging immune biomarkers for personalized immunotherapy in CRC. Also, we present a template for biomarker-guided clinical trials that are needed to move new immunotherapy approaches closer to clinical application.",

     "abstract": "In the past few years we have seen remarkable paradigm shifts in the treatment of many solid tumors due to the introduction of inhibitors targeting immune checkpoints such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Recent results indicate that checkpoint inhibition also represents a very promising approach for certain types of hematologic malignancies. Unfortunately, treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is also associated with substantial toxicities and high costs and only a subset of patients appears to derive clinical benefit from these treatments. This demonstrates the urgent need for biomarkers for the identification of patient populations that are likely to respond to this type of therapy and/or have fewer side effects. Here, we have reviewed available information on the prognostic and predictive value of biomarkers for anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 as the most commonly used checkpoint inhibitors. There are currently no reliable biomarkers capable of predicting responses to anti-CTLA-4 agents, such as ipilimumab, in hematologic malignancies. Certain polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 gene, however, seem to have an impact on the patients\u2019 outcome, especially in the case of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). There is now sufficient data supporting PD-L1 expression levels in the tumor tissue as an independent prognostic factor in B cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Overexpression of PD-L1 in the tumor tissue and elevated serum levels of soluble PD-L1 may also represent adverse prognostic factors in certain subtypes of T cell lymphomas. Finally, expression levels of PD-L1 also seem to predict responses to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 approaches in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Future studies will have to further delineate the prognostic/predictive role of PD-L1 expression as a biomarker in hematologic malignancies and may be able to identify confounding variables, which will hopefully to some extent be generalizable to other types of anti-tumor immunotherapies.",

While many HNSCCs are related to classical etiologic factors of smoking and alcohol, a clinically, genomically, and immunologically distinct subgroup of tumors arise from the epithelium of the tonsil and the base of tongue as a result of infection with Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). In this review we describe the genomic and immunologic landscape of HNSCC, highlighting differences between HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC. While HPV-negative tumors are characterized by tobacco-associated mutations in genes including TP53 and CDKN2A, in HPV-positive HNSCC integration of viral genome from HPV into the host cellular genome results in expression of the E6 and E7 viral oncoproteins, with consequent degradation of p53 and functional inactivation of Rb. The immune microenvironment of HNSCC is characterized by changes in immune cell populations, immune checkpoints, as well as tumor or microenvironmental factors that alter the balance of the immune milieu in favor of immunosuppression, allowing tumor evasion and escape from immune surveillance. Immune therapies, in particular those targeting the PD1 receptor or its ligand PD-L1, including nivolumab, pembrolizumab, durvalumab, and atezolizumab have shown significant efficacy in subsets of patients with HNSCC. Current trials are evaluating the efficacy of these agents in combination with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and other immune therapies including CTLA-4 and IDO-1 inhibitors. While biomarkers including PD-L1 expression, PD-L2 expression and the interferon-gamma gene signature show potential to predict benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy \u2013 it is hoped that improved understanding of the genomic and immune landscape will lead to ways to improved strategies to stratify patients and to select which HNSCC are most likely to benefit from these therapies.",

These microbes occupy different habitats such as gut, skin, vagina, oral etc. Not only the types and abundance of microbes are different in different organs, but also these may differ in different individuals. The genome of these microbiota and their ecosystem constitute to form a microbiome. Factors such as diet, environment, host genetics etc. may be the reason behind the wide microbial diversity. A number of studies performed on human microbiome have revealed that microbiota present in healthy and diseased individuals are distinct. Altered microbiome is many a times the reason behind the overexpression of genes which may cause complex diseases including cancer. Manipulation of the human microbiome can be done by microbial supplements such as probiotics or synbiotics, diet or prebiotics and microbial suppression strategies using antibiotics. Recent advances in genome sequencing technologies and metagenomic analysis provide us the broader understanding of these commensal microbes and highlighting the distinctive features of microbiome during healthy and disease states. Molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE) studies have been very helpful in providing insights into the pathological process behind disease evolution and progression by determining the specific etiological factors.

Many prominent cancer-associated molecules have been identified over the recent years which include EGFR, CD44, TGFbRII, HER2, miR-497, NMP22, BTA, Fibrin/FDP etc. These biomarkers are often used for screening, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction and monitoring of cancer development. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an essential component in all human cells which is present on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. The oxidative stress causes exposure of PS on the surface of the vascular endothelium in the cancer cells (lung, breast, pancreatic, bladder, skin, brain metastasis, rectal adenocarcinoma etc.) but not on the normal cells. The external PS is regulated by calcium-dependent flippase activity. Cancer cell lines with high surface PS have low flippase activity and high intracellular calcium content. Human Annexin-V, PS targeting antibodies (PGN635 and bavituximab and mch1N11), lysosomal protein, phospholipid Saposin C dioleoylphosphatidylserine (SapC\u2013DOPS), peptide-peptoid hybrid PPS1, PS-binding 14-mer peptide (PSBP-6) and hexapeptide (E3) have been reported to target PS present on cancer cell surface. High expression of CD47 inhibits tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages. The PS cancer biomarker has also been used to target the drugs to cancer cells specifically without affecting other healthy cells. Currently, the fusion protein (FP) consisting of L-methionase linked to human Annexin-V has been reported to target the cancer cells. The FP catalyzes the conversion of non-toxic prodrug selenomethionine into toxic methyl selenol which thus also prevents the methionine (essential amino acid) supplementation to the cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Most of the cancer deaths could be avoided by early detection of the tumor when it is confined to its primary site and it has not metastasized. To this aim, one of the most promising strategies is the discovery and detection of protein biomarkers shed by the young tumor to the bloodstream. Proteomic technologies, mainly mass spectrometry and multiplexed immunoassays, have rapidly developed during last years with improved limits of detection and multiplexing capability. Unfortunately, these developments together major investments and large international efforts have not resulted into new useful protein biomarkers. Here, we analyze the potential and limitations of current proteomic technologies for detecting protein biomarkers released into circulation by the tumor. We find that these technologies can hardly probe the deepest region of the plasma proteome, at concentrations below the pg/mL level, where protein biomarkers for early cancer detection may exist. This clearly indicates the need of incorporating novel ultrasensitive techniques to the proteomic tool-box that can cover the inaccessible regions of the plasma proteome. We here propose biological detectors based on nanomechanical systems for discovery and detection of cancer protein biomarkers in plasma. We review the modes of operation of these devices, putting our focus on recent developments on nanomechanical sandwich immunoassays and nanomechanical spectrometry. The first technique enables reproducible immunodetection of proteins at concentrations well below the pg/mL level, with a limit of detection on the verge of 10 ag/mL. This technology can potentially detect low abundance tumor-associated proteins in plasma at the very early stages of the tumor. The second technique enables the identification of individual intact proteins by two physical coordinates, the mass and stiffness, instead of the mass-to-charge ratio of the protein constituents. This technology enormously simplifies the identification of proteins and it can provide useful information on interactions and posttranslational modifications, that otherwise is lost in mass spectrometry.",

Determining prognosis can best be addressed with a combination of traditional clinicopathological prognostic factors, biomarkers such as HER2/neu and specific multigene genes tests. Amongst the best validated prognostic multigene tests are uPA/PAI1, Oncotype DX and MammaPrint. Oncotype DX and MammaPrint, may be used for predicting outcome and aiding adjunct therapy decision making in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancers that are either lymph node-negative or node positive (1\u20133 metastatic nodes), while uPA/PAI-1 may be similarly used in ER-positive, lymph node-negative patients. For selecting likely response to endocrine therapy, both estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) should be measured. On the other hand, for identifying likely response to anti-HER2 therapy, determination of HER2 gene amplification or overexpression is necessary. To identify new prognostic and predictive biomarkers for breast cancer, current research is focusing on tumor and circulating DNA (ctDNA) and RNA (e.g., micro RNAs) and circulating tumor cells. A promising ctDNA biomarker is the mutational status of ER (ESR1) for predicting the emergence of resistance to aromatase inhibitors.

These findings not only lead to remarkable progress in targeted therapies for lung cancer patients, but also provide fundamental knowledge for the subclassification of NSCLC. More recently, the advancement and clinical application of immunotherapy have reinforced the need for the accurate subclassification of NSCLC. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) updated their guidelines for the subclassification of lung cancers. These guidelines emphasize: (1) the subclassification of NSCLC, (2) the critical role of molecular characterization of tumors for targeted therapy, (3) the unique terminology for subclassifying NSCLC using small biopsy specimens, and (4) the utility of IHC biomarkers in the accurate diagnosis and subclassification of lung cancer. The guidelines have significant prognostic impact on oncologic practice and patient care. In this review, we summarize the current WHO guidelines for the classification of lung cancer, discuss advancements of targeted therapy and immunotherapy, and address the utility and limitation of immunomarkers in the subclassification of NSCLC, as well as the prospective future of the field.",

In chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common adult leukemia, the epigenetic \u2018landscape\u2019 has added a new layer of complexity to our understanding of this clinically and biologically heterogeneous disease. Early studies identified aberrant DNA methylation, often based on single gene promoter analysis with both biological and clinical impact. Subsequent genome-wide profiling studies revealed differential DNA methylation between CLLs and controls and in prognostics subgroups of the disease. From these studies, it became apparent that DNA methylation in regions outside of promoters, such as enhancers, is important for the regulation of coding genes as well as for the regulation of non-coding RNAs. Although DNA methylation profiles are reportedly stable over time and in relation to therapy, a higher epigenetic heterogeneity or \u2018burden\u2019 is seen in more aggressive CLL subgroups, albeit as non-recurrent \u2018passenger\u2019 events. More recently, DNA methylation profiles in CLL analyzed in relation to differentiating normal B-cell populations revealed that the majority of the CLL epigenome reflects the epigenomes present in the cell of origin and that only a small fraction of the epigenetic alterations represents truly CLL-specific changes. Furthermore, CLL patients can be grouped into at least three clinically relevant epigenetic subgroups, potentially originating from different cells at various stages of differentiation and associated with distinct outcomes. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the DNA methylome in CLL, the role of histone modifying enzymes, highlight insights derived from animal models and attempts made to target epigenetic regulators in CLL along with the future directions of this rapidly advancing field.",

Genes encoding epigenetic regulators are often mutated in cancer, underscoring their central roles in carcinogenesis. In hematological cancers, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), drugs that reverse epigenetic aberrations are now the standard of care. Recent in vitro studies suggest that vitamin C at physiological concentrations, combined with hypomethylating agents may act synergistically to cause DNA demethylation through active and passive mechanisms, respectively. Additionally, several recent studies have renewed interest in the use of pharmacological doses of vitamin C injected intravenously to selectively kill tumor cells.

The common denominator of these malignant myeloid disorders is the limited benefit of conventional chemotherapy and a particular responsiveness to epigenetic therapy with the DNA-hypomethylating agents 5-azacytidine (azacitidine) or decitabine. However, hypomethylating therapy does not eradicate the malignant clone in MDS or JMML and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) remains the only curative treatment option.

Due to progress with targeted and immunotherapies, the median survival of metastatic melanoma patients is now over 2 years. The disease is characterised by one of the highest somatic mutation rates observed amongst cancer types, with a specific mutational signature based on UV radiation damage evident. Highly prevalent mutations, such as the BRAFV600E, in the MAPK cascade indicate truncal involvement of this pathway in the earliest stage of melanoma. The molecular sub-classification of melanoma based on genetic alterations is now well established. This has paved the way for researchers in epigenetics to investigate specific pathways of known importance, and the involvement of the diverse range of epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, we review the literature to highlight that epigenetic alterations are integrally involved in this malignancy. We focus on the most current evidence around the epigenetic mechanisms: DNA methylation and demethylation including 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine; histone post-translational modifications including variant histones; chromatin remodelling complexes and in particular the polycomb-repressive complex PRC2 and its histone methyltransferase subunit EZH2; and non-coding RNAs.

With the advent of low-input and single-cell technologies as well as sophisticated cell labeling techniques, our understanding of transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of hematopoiesis is currently undergoing dramatic changes. Increasingly, evidence suggests that the epigenome conformation acts as a critical decision-making mechanism that instructs self-renewal, differentiation and developmental fates of hematopoietic progenitor cells. When dysregulated, this leads to the evolution of disease states such as leukemia. Indeed, aberrations in DNA methylation, histone modifications and genome architecture are characteristic features of many hematopoietic neoplasms in which epigenetic enzymes are frequently mutated. Sequencing studies and characterization of the epigenetic landscape in lymphomas, leukemias and in aged healthy individuals with clonal hematopoiesis have been indispensible to identify epigenetic regulators that play a role in transformation or pre-disposition to hematopoietic malignancies. In this review, we outline the current view of the hematopoietic system and the epigenetic mechanisms regulating hematopoiesis under homeostatic conditions, with a particular focus on the role of DNA methylation in this process.

Furthermore, a large portion of patients are still treated with conventional chemotherapy that is only modestly effective.

     "abstract": "The epigenetic landscape undergoes a widespread modulation during embryonic development and cell differentiation. Within the hematopoietic system, B cells are perhaps the cell lineage with a more dynamic DNA methylome during their maturation process, which involves approximately one third of all the CpG sites of the genome. Although each B-cell maturation step displays its own DNA methylation fingerprint, the DNA methylome is more extensively modified in particular maturation transitions. These changes are gradually accumulated in specific chromatin environments as cell differentiation progresses and reflect different features and functional states of B cells. Promoters and enhancers of B-cell transcription factors acquire activation-related epigenetic marks and are sequentially expressed in particular maturation windows. These transcription factors further reconfigure the epigenetic marks and activity state of their target sites to regulate the expression of genes related to B-cell functions. Together with this observation, extensive DNA methylation changes in areas outside gene regulatory elements such as hypomethylation of heterochromatic regions and hypermethylation of CpG-rich regions, also take place in mature B cells, which intriguingly have been described as hallmarks of cancer. This process starts in germinal center B cells, a highly proliferative cell type, and becomes particularly apparent in long-lived cells such as memory and plasma cells. Overall, the characterization of the DNA methylome during B-cell differentiation not only provides insights into the complex epigenetic network of regulatory elements that mediate the maturation process but also suggests that late B cells also passively accumulate epigenetic changes related to cell proliferation and longevity.",

These studies have mainly defined genetic changes as either causal, providing a selective advantage to the cancer cell (a driver mutation) or consequential with no selective advantage (not directly causal, a passenger mutation). A vast unresolved question is how a primary cancer cell becomes metastatic and what are the molecular events that underpin this process. However, extensive sequencing efforts indicate that mutation may not be a causal factor for primary to metastatic transition. On the other hand, epigenetic changes are dynamic in nature and therefore potentially play an important role in determining metastatic phenotypes and this area of research is just starting to be appreciated. Unlike genetic studies, current limitations in studying epigenetic events in cancer metastasis include a lack of conceptual understanding and an analytical framework for identifying putative driver and passenger epigenetic changes.

     "abstract": "The onset of global epigenetic changes in chromatin that drive tumor proliferation and heterogeneity is a hallmark of many forms of cancer. Identifying the epigenetic mechanisms that govern these changes and developing therapeutic approaches to modulate them, is a well-established avenue pursued in translational cancer medicine. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) arises clonally when a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires the capacity to produce the constitutively active tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 fusion protein which drives tumor development. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) that target BCR-ABL1 has been transformative in CML management but it does not lead to cure in the vast majority of patients. Thus novel therapeutic approaches are required and these must target changes to biological pathways that are aberrant in CML \u2212 including those that occur when epigenetic mechanisms are altered. These changes may be due to alterations in DNA or histones, their biochemical modifications and requisite \u2018writer\u2019 proteins, or to dysregulation of various types of non-coding RNAs that collectively function as modulators of transcriptional control and DNA integrity. Here, we review the evidence for subverted epigenetic mechanisms in CML and how these impact on a diverse set of biological pathways, on disease progression, prognosis and drug resistance. We will also discuss recent progress towards developing epigenetic therapies that show promise to improve CML patient care and may lead to improved cure rates.",

     "abstract": "Over the last decade transcriptional dysregulation and altered epigenetic programs have emerged as a hallmark in the majority of hematological cancers. Several epigenetic regulators are recurrently mutated in many hematological malignancies. In addition, in those cases that lack epigenetic mutations, altered function of epigenetic regulators has been shown to play a central role in the pathobiology of many hematological neoplasms, through mechanisms that are becoming increasingly understood. This, in turn, has led to the development of small molecule inhibitors of dysregulated epigenetic pathways as novel targeted therapies for hematological malignancies. In this review, we will present the most recent advances in our understanding of the role played by dysregulated epigenetic programs in the development and maintenance of hematological neoplasms. We will describe novel therapeutics targeting altered epigenetic programs and outline their mode of action. We will then discuss their use in specific conditions, identify potential limitations and putative toxicities while also providing an update on their current clinical development. Finally, we will highlight the opportunities presented by epigenetically targeted therapies in hematological malignancies and introduce the challenges that need to be tackled by both the research and clinical communities to best translate these novel therapies into clinical practice and to improve patient outcomes.",

FOXO4 significantly regulates cell cycle, resists oxidative stress, and responses to hypoxia. FOXO4 alteration is closely linked to the progression of human cancer. In this review, we introduce the regulation of FOXO4 in physiological and pathological conditions. Particularly, the pathophysiological processes and molecular pathways regulated by FOXO4 in the development and progression of cancer are also summarized. Moreover, whether FOXO4 acts as a tumor-suppressor or pro-tumoral factor in tumors and the potential directions of future FOXO4 research are discussed.

The focus of the current review is to evaluate the latest research progress regarding the roles of FOXO proteins in cancer EMT.

Next, we present the interactions between FOXO proteins and multiple EMT-associated pathways during malignancy development. Finally, we propose several novel potential directions for future research.

     "abstract": "Cancer cells are exposed to adverse conditions within the tumor microenvironment that challenge cells to adapt and survive. Several of these homeostatic perturbations insults alter the normal function of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), resulting in the accumulation of misfolded proteins. ER stress triggers a conserved signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) to cope with the stress or trigger apoptosis of damaged cells. The UPR has been described as a major driver in the acquisition of malignant characteristics that ultimately lead to cancer progression. Although, several reports describe the relevance of the UPR in tumor growth, the possible crosstalk with other cancer-related pathways is starting to be elucidated. The Forkhead Box O (FoxO) subfamily of proteins has a major role in cancer progression, where chromosomal translocations and deregulated signaling lead to loss-of-function of FoxO proteins, contributing to tumor progression. Here we discuss the homeostatic connection between the UPR and FoxO proteins and its possible implications to tumor progression and the acquisition of several hallmarks of cancer. In addition, studies linking a crosstalk between the UPR and FoxO proteins in other diseases, including neurodegeneration and metabolic disorders is provided.",

     "abstract": "In the tumor microenvironment (TME), cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells, along with their extracellular factors, have profound effects on either promoting or repressing anti-cancer immunity. Accumulating evidence has shown the paradoxical intrinsic role of the Forkhead box O (FOXO) family of transcription factors in cancer, which can act as a tumor repressor while also maintaining cancer stem cells. FOXOs also regulate cancer immunity. FOXOs promote antitumor activity through negatively regulating the expression of immunosuppressive proteins, such as programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in tumor cells or stromal cells, which can shape an immunotolerant state in the TME. FOXOs also intrinsically control the anti-tumor immune response as well as the homeostasis and development of immune cells, including T cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. As a cancer repressor, reviving the activity of Foxo1 forces tumor-infiltrating activated regulatory T (Treg) cells to egress from tumor tissues. As a promoter of cancer development, Foxo3 and Foxo1 negatively regulate cytotoxicity of both CD8+ T cells and NK cells against tumor cells. In this review, we focus on the complex role of FOXOs in regulating cancer immunity due to the various roles that they play in cancer cells, stromal cells, and immune cells. We also speculate on some possible additional roles of FOXOs in cancer immunity based on findings regarding FOXOs in non-cancer settings, such as infectious disease.",

In agreement with these opposing views on the role of FOXOs in cancer, studies using FOXO levels or activity as prognostic markers for cancer patient disease progression and survival came to contradicting results.

More recently, FoxO proteins have been implicated in cancer immunity and cancer stem-cell (CSC) homeostasis. Interestingly, in some sporadic sub-populations, FoxO protein function may also be manipulated by factors such as \u03b2-catenin whereby they instead can facilitate cancer progression via maintenance of CSC properties or promoting drug resistance or metastasis and invasion. This review highlights the essential biological functions of FoxOs and explores the areas that may be exploited in FoxO protein signaling pathways in the development of novel cancer therapeutic agents.",

In the recent decades, much knowledge has been gained concerning the chemical formation pathways and the role of DCs in food and physiological systems. DCs are formed mainly by dehydration and redox reactions and have a strong impact on the palatability of food, because they participate in aroma and color formation. However, they are precursors of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), and cytotoxic effects of several DCs have been reported. The most abundant DCs in food are 3-deoxyglucosone, 3-deoxygalactosone, and glucosone, predominating over methylglyoxal, glyoxal, and 3,4-dideoxyglucosone-3-ene. The availability for absorption of individual DCs is influenced by the release from the food matrix during digestion and by their reactivity towards constituents of intestinal fluids. Some recent works suggest formation of DCs from dietary sugars after their absorption, and others indicate that certain food constituents may scavenge endogenously formed DCs. First works on the interplay between dietary DCs and diseases reveal an ambiguous role of the compounds. Cancer-promoting but also anticancer effects were ascribed to methylglyoxal. Further work is still needed to elucidate the reactions of DCs during intestinal digestion and pathophysiological effects of dietary DCs at doses taken up with food and in \u201creal\u201d food matrices in disease states such as diabetes, uremia, and cancer.",

Oxidative stress can trigger variable transcription factors, such as nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor (Nrf2), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), protein-53 (p-53), activating protein-1 (AP-1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), \u03b2-catenin/Wnt and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3). Activated transcription factors can lead to approximately 500 different alterations in gene expression, and can alter expression patterns of inflammatory cytokines, growth factors, regulatory cell cycle molecules, and anti-inflammatory molecules. These alterations of gene expression can induce a normal cell to become a tumor cell.Glycative stress resulting from advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and reactive dicarbonyls can significantly affect cancer progression. AGEs are fashioned from the multifaceted chemical reaction of reducing sugars with a compound containing an amino group. AGEs bind to and trigger the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) through AGE-RAGE interaction, which is a major modulator of inflammation allied tumors. Dicarbonyls like, GO (glyoxal), MG (methylglyoxal) and 3-DG (3-deoxyglucosone) fashioned throughout lipid peroxidation, glycolysis, and protein degradation are viewed as key precursors of AGEs. These dicarbonyls lead to the carbonyl stress in living organisms, possibly resulting in carbonyl impairment of proteins, carbohydrates, DNA, and lipoproteins. The damage caused by carbonyls results in numerous lesions, some of which are involved in cancer pathogenesis. In this review, the effects of oxidative, carbonyl and glycative stress on cancer initiation and progression are thoroughly discussed, including probable signaling pathways and the effects on tumorigenesis.",

Glycation of biological macromolecules results in the progression of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) that proliferates the process of carcinogenesis by activation of transcription factors and release of cytokines. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGEs) with the binding of its different ligands like; AGEs, HMGB1 and S100 activate the signalling arrays. The activation of downstream signalling pathway ultimately leads to the pathophysiological conditions of diabetes, ageing, neurological disorders and cancers as well as a result of the activation of transcription factors which is discussed in the main body text of this review. However, there might be a likelihood of the positive effect of the HMGB1 and S100 proteins in cancer. Still, some untouched mechanisms might be responsible for the establishment of the function of AGE-RAGE or AGE-sRAGE axis activation that leads to the friend-foe association with the cancers. The levels of RAGE and s-RAGE may be a useful biomarker of ligand-RAGE pathway activation and cancer. Thus, the possibility of providing a potential complement to carcinogenesis is very high which might be an interesting target for therapeutic interventions. This article is an insightful assessment on AGE, RAGE and s-RAGE for its possible role in cancer onset and progression.

It modifies protein and DNA to form mainly hydroimidazolone MG-H1 and imidazopurinone MGdG adducts, respectively. Abnormal accumulation of MG, dicarbonyl stress, increases adduct levels which may induce apoptosis and replication catastrophe. In the non-malignant state, Glo1 is a tumour suppressor protein and small molecule inducers of Glo1 expression may find use in cancer prevention. Increased Glo1 expression is permissive for growth of tumours with high glycolytic activity and is thereby a biomarker of tumour growth. High Glo1 expression is a cause of multi-drug resistance. It is produced by over-activation of the Nrf2 pathway and GLO1 amplification. Glo1 inhibitors are antitumour agents, inducing apoptosis and necrosis, and anoikis. Tumour stem cells and tumours with high flux of MG formation and Glo1 expression are sensitive to Glo1 inhibitor therapy. It is likely that MG-induced cell death contributes to the mechanism of action of current antitumour agents.

Eight of these families are physiologically activated downstream of growth factor signalling, while other AGC kinases are downstream effectors of a wide range of signals. The different AGC kinase families share aspects of their mechanisms of inhibition and activation. In the present review, we update the knowledge of the mechanisms of regulation of different AGC kinases. The conformation of the catalytic domain of many AGC kinases is regulated allosterically through the modulation of the conformation of a regulatory site on the small lobe of the kinase domain, the PIF-pocket. The PIF-pocket acts like an ON-OFF switch in AGC kinases with different modes of regulation, i.e. PDK1, PKB/Akt, LATS and Aurora kinases. In this review, we make emphasis on how the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of regulation can guide the discovery and development of small allosteric modulators. Molecular probes stabilizing the PIF-pocket in the active conformation are activators, while compounds stabilizing the disrupted site are allosteric inhibitors. One challenge for the rational development of allosteric modulators is the lack of complete structural information of the inhibited forms of full-length AGC kinases. On the other hand, we suggest that the available information derived from molecular biology and biochemical studies can already guide screening strategies for the identification of innovative mode of action molecular probes and the development of selective allosteric drugs for the treatment of human diseases.",

     "abstract": "Rational target therapy of cancer would benefit from the identification of new targets that can be easily inhibited by small molecules. An increasing amount of evidence hints at 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1 or PDPK1) as an intriguing and underexplored target for cancer therapy. Several reports show that PDK1 expression is dysregulated in multiple cancer types. Furthermore PDK1 is implicated in signaling pathways frequently altered in cancer, such as PI3K/Akt, Ras/MAPK and Myc. PDK1 targeting has been proven to be effective in experimental models harboring alterations of these pathways. In this paper we review PDK1 main biochemical mechanisms, its alterations in cancer and interactions with relevant cancer pathways. A potential role of PDK1 in tumor microenvironment is also discussed.",

     "abstract": "The AGC family of serine/threonine kinases (PKA, PKG, PKC) includes more than 60 members that are critical regulators of numerous cellular functions, including cell cycle and differentiation, morphogenesis, and cell survival and death. Mutation and/or dysregulation of AGC kinases can lead to malignant cell transformation and contribute to the pathogenesis of many human diseases. Members of one subgroup of AGC kinases, the protein kinase C (PKC), have been singled out as critical players in carcinogenesis, following their identification as the intracellular receptors of phorbol esters, which exhibit tumor-promoting activities. This observation attracted the attention of researchers worldwide and led to intense investigations on the role of PKC in cell transformation and the potential use of PKC as therapeutic drug targets in cancer diseases. Studies demonstrated that many cancers had altered expression and/or mutation of specific PKC genes. However, the causal relationships between the changes in PKC gene expression and/or mutation and the direct cause of cancer remain elusive. Independent studies in normal cells demonstrated that activation of PKC is essential for the induction of cell activation and proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. Based on these observations and the general assumption that PKC isoforms play a positive role in cell transformation and/or cancer progression, many PKC inhibitors have entered clinical trials but the numerous attempts to target PKC in cancer has so far yielded only very limited success. More recent studies demonstrated that PKC function as tumor suppressors, and suggested that future clinical efforts should focus on restoring, rather than inhibiting, PKC activity. The present manuscript provides some historical perspectives on the tumor promoting function of PKC, reviewing some of the observations linking PKC to cancer progression, and discusses the role of PKC in the pathogenesis of cancer diseases and its potential usage as a therapeutic target.",

RSK expression and activity are dysregulated in several malignancies, including breast, prostate, and lung cancer, and available evidence suggests that RSK may be a promising cancer therapeutic target.

Currently, most AGC inhibitors in clinical development are Akt inhibitors such as MK-2206 or GDC-0068, which are known to promote cell growth arrest and to sensitize cancer cells to radiotherapy. Response rates in clinical trials with single agent Akt inhibitors are typically low. The observed adverse events are within the expected limits for compounds inhibiting the PI3K-mTOR axis. Preclinical and early clinical data for combination therapies are accumulating. Based on these data, several Akt inhibitors are about to enter phase 3 trials. Besides drugs that target Akt, p70S6K inhibitors have entered clinical development. Again, the response rates were rather low. In addition, relevant toxicities were identified, including a risk for coagulopathies with these compounds. Multi-AGC kinase inhibitors are also in early clinical development but the data is not sufficient yet to draw conclusions regarding their efficacy and side-effect profile. PKC inhibitors have been tested in the phase 3 setting but were found to lack efficacy. More trials with isoform-specific PKC inhibitors are expected. Taken together, therapies with AGC kinase inhibitors as single agents are unlikely to meet success. However, combination therapies and a precise stratification of patients according to the activation of signaling axes may increase the probability to see relevant efficacy with these compounds. The emergence of onco-immunotherapies holds some new challenges for these agents.",

Alterations in the expression and/or activity of particular GRKs have been identified in several types of tumors, and demonstrated to modulate the proliferation, survival or invasive properties of tumor cells by acting as integrating signaling nodes. GRKs are able to regulate the functionality of both G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and growth factor receptors and to directly control cytosolic, cytoskeletal or nuclear signaling components of pathways relevant for these processes. Furthermore, many chemokines as well as angiogenic and inflammatory factors present in the tumor microenvironment act through GPCR and other GRK-modulated signaling modules. Changes in the dosage of certain GRKs in the tumor stroma can alter tumor angiogenesis and the homing of immune cells, thus putting forward these kinases as potentially relevant modulators of the carcinoma-fibroblast-endothelial-immune cell network fostering tumor development and dissemination. A better understanding of the alterations in different GRK isoforms taking place during cancer development and metastasis in specific tumors and cell types and of its impact in signaling pathways would help to design novel therapeutic strategies.",

Mitochondria have been identified as signaling organelles, capable of mediating bidirectional intracellular information transfer: anterograde (from nucleus to mitochondria) and retrograde (from mitochondria to nucleus). More recently, evidence is now building that the role of mitochondria extends to intercellular communication as well, and that the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) and even whole mitochondria are indeed mobile and can mediate information transfer between cells.

However, more recently it has become clear that cancers rely heavily on mitochondrial activities including lipid, nucleotide and amino acid synthesis, suppression of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis as well as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) for growth and survival.

Proteins encoded in the mtDNA, all components of the multimeric OXPHOS enzymes, are synthesized in specialized mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes). Mitoribosomes are therefore essential in the regulation of cellular respiration. Additionally, an increasing body of literature has been reporting an alternative role for several mitochondrial ribosomal proteins as apoptosis-inducing factors. No surprisingly, the expression of genes encoding for mitoribosomal proteins, mitoribosome assembly factors and mitochondrial translation factors is modified in numerous cancers, a trait that has been linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis.

This paper reviews the bacterial targeting of mediators of mitochondrial genomic fidelity and of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, and compares the impact of the bacterial alteration of mitochondrial function to that of cancer. Bacterial virulence factors have been demonstrated to induce mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and to modulate DNA repair pathways of the mitochondria. Furthermore, virulence factors can induce or impair the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. The effect of bacterial targeting of mitochondria is analogous to behavior of mitochondria in a wide array of tumours, and this strongly suggests that mitochondrial targeting of bacteria is a risk factor for carcinogenesis.",

We have named the process numtogenesis, defining the term as the transfer of mtDNA into the nuclear genome, or, less specifically, the transfer of mitochondria or mitochondrial components into the nucleus. There is increasing evidence of the involvement of NUMTs in human biology and pathology. Although information pertaining to NUMTs and numtogenesis is sparse, the role of this aspect of mitochondrial biology to human cancers is apparent. In this review, we present available knowledge about the origin and mechanisms of numtogenesis, with special emphasis on the role of NUMTs in human malignancies. We describe studies undertaken in our laboratory and in others and discuss the influence of NUMTs in tumor initiation and progression and in survival of cancer patients. We describe suppressors of numtogenesis and evolutionary conserved mechanisms underlying numtogenesis in cancer. An understanding the emerging field of numtogenesis should allow comprehension of this process in various malignancies and other diseases and, more generally, in human health.",

Mitophagy is activated by stresses such as hypoxia, nutrient deprivation, DNA damage, inflammation and mitochondrial membrane depolarization and plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function. Defects in mitophagy lead to mitochondrial dysfunction that can affect metabolic reprogramming in response to stress, alter cell fate determination and differentiation, which in turn affects disease incidence and etiology, including cancer. Here, we discuss how different mitophagy adaptors and modulators, including Parkin, BNIP3, BNIP3L, p62/SQSTM1 and OPTN, are regulated in response to physiological stresses and deregulated in cancers. Additionally, we explore how these different mitophagy control pathways coordinate with each other. Finally, we review new developments in understanding how mitophagy affects stemness, cell fate determination, inflammation and DNA damage responses that are relevant to understanding the role of mitophagy in cancer.",

     "abstract": "Mitochondria, which are multi-functional, have been implicated in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis due to metabolic alterations in transformed cells. Mitochondria are involved in the generation of energy, cell growth and differentiation, cellular signaling, cell cycle control, and cell death. To date, the mitochondrial basis of cancer disparities is unknown. The goal of this review is to provide an understanding and a framework of mitochondrial determinants that may contribute to cancer disparities in racially different populations.Due to maternal inheritance and ethnic-based diversity, the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) contributes to inherited racial disparities. In people of African ancestry, several germline, population-specific haplotype variants in mtDNA as well as depletion of mtDNA have been linked to cancer predisposition and cancer disparities. Indeed, depletion of mtDNA and mutations in mtDNA or nuclear genome (nDNA)-encoded mitochondrial proteins lead to mitochondrial dysfunction and promote resistance to apoptosis, the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, and metastatic disease, all of which can contribute to cancer disparity and tumor aggressiveness related to racial disparities. Ethnic differences at the level of expression or genetic variations in nDNA encoding the mitochondrial proteome, including mitochondria-localized mtDNA replication and repair proteins, miRNA, transcription factors, kinases and phosphatases, and tumor suppressors and oncogenes may underlie susceptibility to high-risk and aggressive cancers found in African population and other ethnicities.The mitochondrial retrograde signaling that alters the expression profile of nuclear genes in response to dysfunctional mitochondria is a mechanism for tumorigenesis. In ethnic populations, differences in mitochondrial function may alter the cross talk between mitochondria and the nucleus at epigenetic and genetic levels, which can also contribute to cancer health disparities. Targeting mitochondrial determinants and mitochondrial retrograde signaling could provide a promising strategy for the development of selective anticancer therapy for dealing with cancer disparities. Further, agents that restore mitochondrial function to optimal levels should permit sensitivity to anticancer agents for the treatment of aggressive tumors that occur in racially diverse populations and hence help in reducing racial disparities.",

Phytochemicals derived from edible and medicinal plants have been studied rather extensively for cancer chemoprevention using preclinical models in the past few decades. Nevertheless, some of these agents (e.g., isothiocyanates from cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and watercress) have already entered into clinical investigations. Examples of widely studied and highly promising phytochemicals from edible and medicinal plants include cruciferous vegetable constituents (phenethyl isothiocyanate, benzyl isothiocyanate, and sulforaphane), withaferin A (WA) derived from a medicinal plant (Withania somnifera) used heavily in Asia, and an oriental medicine plant component honokiol (HNK). An interesting feature of these structurally-diverse phytochemicals is that they target mitochondria to provoke cancer cell-selective death program. Mechanisms underlying cell death induction by commonly studied phytochemicals have been discussed rather extensively and thus are not covered in this review article. Instead, the primary focus of this perspective is to discuss experimental evidence pointing to mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer chemoprevention by promising phytochemicals.",

While potentially able to exert tumor control, this inflammatory reaction is typically seized upon by the tumor to promote its own growth and progression towards metastasis. This review focuses on recent advances in understanding how an established tumor can initiate an inflammatory response via the release of pro-inflammatory mediators, such as IL-6 and IL-8, and their roles in cancer metastasis.

The present review critically evaluate clinical and pre-clinical studies based on polyphenol administration, which contributed to support the concept, deeply rooted in the general population, that antioxidant polyphenols can fight cancer. The controversial and contradictory issues related to the pros and cons on the use of polyphenols against cancer reflect the confounding assumption that cancer treatment and cancer prevention may overlap.

It was estimated that in 2016, 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer were expected to be diagnosed in women in the US, along with 61,000 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer. The heterogeneity of breast cancer accounts for its differential molecular subtyping. Recent incorporation of high throughput approaches helps early prognosis of breast cancer, but recurrence of the disease stands to be one of the most daunting fact behind non-availability of third line treatment. At this point of crisis, application of chemopreventive measures could possibly resolve the enigma of breast cancer. The world class beverage tea has proven its efficacy in ameliorating various genetic and epigenetic anomalies in breast cancer. Tea phytoconstituents are known to modulate myriad molecular events which include prominent regulators of intracellular signaling, such as phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B/nuclear factor-\u03baB, epidermal growth factor receptor, vascular endothelial growth factor, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2 associated X protein in the development and progression of breast carcinoma.

     "abstract": "A direct impact of food on health, which demonstrates that dietary habit is one of the most important determinants of chronic diseases such as cancers, has led to an increased interest of the consumers toward natural bioactive compounds as functional ingredients or nutraceuticals. Epidemiological studies revealed that the populations of many Asian countries with high consumption of fish and seafood have low prevalence of particular type of cancers such as lung, breast, colorectal and prostate cancers. This observation has led to extensive investigations of the benefits of compounds present in edible marine organisms such as fish, marine invertebrates (mollusks, echinoderms) and marine algae as cancer chemopreventive agents. Interestingly, many of these marine organisms not only constitute as seafood delicacy but also as ingredients used in folk medicine of some East and Southeast Asian countries. The results of the investigations on extracts and compounds from fish (cods, anchovy, eel and also fish protein hydrolysates), mollusks (mussel, oyster, clams and abalone), as well as from sea cucumbers on the in vivo/in vitro anticancer/antitumor activities can, in part, support the health benefits of these edible marine organisms.",

     "abstract": "Artemisia annua L. is used throughout Asia and Africa as tea and press juice to treat malaria and related symptomes (fever, chills). Its active ingredient, artemisinin (ARS), has been developed as antimalarial drug and is used worldwide. Interestingly, the bioactivity is not restricted to malaria treatment. We and others found that ARS-type drugs also reveal anticancer in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we give a systematic overview of the literature published over the past two decades until the end of 2016. Like other natural products, ARS acts in a multi-specific manner against tumors. The cellular response of ARS and its derivatives (dihydroartemisinin, artesunate, artemether, arteether) towards cancer cells include oxidative stress response by reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, DNA damage and repair (base excision repair, homologous recombination, non-homologous end-joining), various cell death modes (apoptosis, autophagy, ferroptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, oncosis), inhibition of angiogenesis and tumor-related signal transduction pathways (e.g. Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway, AMPK pathway, metastatic pathways, and others) and signal transducers (NF-\u03baB, MYC/MAX, AP-1, CREBP, mTOR etc). ARS-type drugs are at the stairways to the clinics. Several published case reports and pilot phase I/II trials indicate clinical anticancer activity of these compounds. Because of unexpected cases of hepatotoxicity, combinations of ARS-type drugs with complementary and alternative medicines are not recommended, until controlled clinical trials will prove the safety of non-approved combination treatments.",

The impact of dietary components, including phytochemicals, is largely studied by nutrigenomics, looking at the gene expression and molecular mechanisms interacting with bioactive compounds and nutrients, based on new \u2018omics\u2019 technologies. The high number of preclinical studies proves the relevant role of nutrigenomics in cancer management. By deciphering the network of nutrient-gene connections associated with cancer, relevant data will be transposed as therapeutic interventions for this devastating pathology and for fulfilling the concept of personalized nutrition. All these are presented under the nutrigenomics canopy for a better comprehension of the relation between ingested phytochemicals and chemoprevention or chemotherapy. The profits from the nutrigenomics progress, with a particular focus on the coding and noncoding genes related to the exposure of natural compounds need to be validated. A precise attention receives the evaluation of the role of natural compounds in tandem with conventional therapy using genomic approaches, with emphasis on the capacity to inhibit drug resistance mechanisms. All these relevant nutrigenomics aspects are summarized in the present review paper. It is concluded that further nutrigenomics studies are required to improve our understanding related to the complex mechanisms of action of the natural compounds and for their appropriate application as gears in cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Curcumin is a natural plant-derived compound that has attracted a lot of attention for its anti-cancer activities. Curcumin can slow proliferation of and induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines, but the precise mechanisms of these effects are not fully understood. However, many lines of evidence suggested that curcumin has a potent impact on gene expression profiles; thus, functional genomics should be the key to understanding how curcumin exerts its anti-cancer activities. Here, we review the published functional genomic studies of curcumin focusing on cancer. Typically, a cancer cell line or a grafted tumor were exposed to curcumin and profiled with microarrays, methylation assays, or RNA-seq. Crucially, these studies are in agreement that curcumin has a powerful effect on gene expression. In the majority of the studies, among differentially expressed genes we found genes involved in cell signaling, apoptosis, and the control of cell cycle. Curcumin can also induce specific methylation changes, and is a powerful regulator of the expression of microRNAs which control oncogenesis. We also reflect on how the broader technological progress in transcriptomics has been reflected on the field of curcumin. We conclude by discussing the areas where more functional genomic studies are highly desirable. Integrated OMICS approaches will clearly be the key to understanding curcumin\u2019s anticancer and chemopreventive effects. Such strategies may become a template for elucidating the mode of action of other natural products; many natural products have pleiotropic effects that are well suited for a systems-level analysis.",

     "abstract": "Polyphenols are secondary plant metabolites which have been studied extensively for their health-promoting properties, and which could also exert pharmacological activities ranging from anti-inflammatory effects, to cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. The main mechanism for programmed cell death is represented by apoptosis, and its dysregulation is involved in the etiopathology of cancer. As such, substances able to induce apoptosis in cancer cells could be used as new anticancer agents. The aim of this paper is to review literature data on the apoptotic effects of polyphenols and the molecular mechanisms through which they induce these effects in cancer cells. In addition, a brief summary of the new delivery forms used to increase the bioavailability, and clinical impact of polyphenols is provided. The studies reported show that many polyphenol rich plant extracts, originating from food and herbal medicine, as well as isolated polyphenols administered individually or in combination, can regulate cell apoptosis primarily through intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms of action in in vitro conditions. Due to these promising results, the use of polyphenols in the treatment of cancer should therefore be deeply investigated. In particular, because of the low number of clinical trials, further studies are required to evaluate the anticancer activity of polyphenols in in vivo conditions.",

Several common plant-based dietary components exert effects on DNA methylation levels, and can positively influence genome stability and the transcription of tumor suppressors and oncogenes. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a substance present in vegetables of the Brassicaeae family, especially broccoli, white cabbage, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower. The in vivo biological effects of I3C are ascribed to a series of oligomeric products (including 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane), developed under acidic conditions. I3C is one of the many natural products and bioactive compounds found in foods which have recently received much attention for its potential effects in cancer prevention and treatment. In vitro studies report that I3C suppresses the proliferation of different tumor cells, including those isolated from breast, prostate, endometrium, and colon cancers. I3C resulted to be a potent in vivo chemopreventive agent for certain hormone-dependent cancers, including breast and cervical cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects are not well defined. In this review, we have analysed recent literature on the use of indole derivatives against various forms of cancer, and have identified the main signalling pathways involved in their anti-cancer effect as PI3K/Akt/mTOR and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.",

These products are now considered as promising options for the development of more effective and less toxic alternatives to the systems of medicine developed primarily in developed countries in the modern era. Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs) are of great interest due to their anti-carcinogenic effects that have been demonstrated using various tumor models including ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced non-melanoma skin cancer. In a pre-clinical mouse model supplementation of a control diet (AIN76A) with GSPs at concentrations of 0.2% and 0.5% (w/w) significantly inhibits the growth and multiplicity of UVB radiation-induced skin tumors. In this review, we summarize the evidence that this inhibition of UVB-induced skin tumor development by dietary GSPs is mediated by a multiplicity of coordinated effects including: (i) Promotion of the repair of damaged DNA by nuclear excision repair mechanisms, and (ii) DNA repair-dependent stimulation of the immune system following the functional activation of dendritic cells and effector T cells. Dietary GSPs hold promise for the development of an effective alternative strategy for the prevention of excessive solar UVB radiation exposure-induced skin diseases including the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in humans.",

Epidemiological, clinical and preclinical studies have supported that daily intake of polyphenol\u2010rich dietary fruits have a strong co-relationship in the prevention of different types of cancer. In addition to direct antioxidant mechanisms, they also regulate several therapeutically important oncogenic signaling and transcription factors. However, after the discovery of microRNA (miRNA), numerous studies have identified that polyphenols, including epigallocatechin-3-gallate, genistein, resveratrol and curcumin exert their anticancer effects by regulating different miRNAs which are implicated in all the stages of cancer. MiRNAs are short, non-coding endogenous RNA, which silence the gene functions by targeting messenger RNA (mRNA) through degradation or translation repression. However, cancer associated miRNAs has emerged only in recent years to support its applications in cancer therapy. Preclinical experiments have suggested that deregulation of single miRNA is sufficient for neoplastic transformation of cells. Indeed, the widespread deregulation of several miRNA profiles of tumor and healthy tissue samples revealed the involvement of many types of miRNA in the development of numerous cancers. Hence, targeting the miRNAs using polyphenols will be a novel and promising strategy in anticancer chemotherapy. Herein, we have critically reviewed the potential applications of polyphenols on various human miRNAs, especially which are involved in oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways.",

In addition, modulation of proteasome and epigenetic changes by the dietary agents also play a major role in their ability to control cancer. Both in vitro and animal based studies support the role of dietary agents in cancer. The efficacy of dietary agents by clinical trials has also been reported. Importantly, natural agents are already in clinical trials against different kinds of cancer. Overall both in vitro and in vivo studies performed with dietary agents strongly support their role in cancer prevention.

The potential health benefits of nutraceuticals are often not realized because of their poor water solubility, chemical instability, adverse taste profile, and low oral bioavailability. Carefully designed food matrices are being developed to overcome these problems. Nutraceuticals can be isolated from their natural environment, and then incorporated into functional foods, often with the help of delivery systems (such as emulsions, nanoemulsions, liposomes, biopolymer nanoparticles, and microgels). Alternatively, the stability and bioavailability of nutraceuticals can be improved by leaving them in their natural environment, but ingesting them with a specially designed \u201cexcipient food\u201d. The structure and composition of an excipient food is controlled so as to enhance the bioaccessibilty, stability, and absorption of the nutraceuticals in the gastrointestinal tract.

In addition, a great deal of studies and reports has highlighted the critical roles of laminins in modulating stem cell phenotype and differentiation, as part of the stem cell niche. Stemming from these discoveries a growing body of literature suggests that laminins may act as regulators of cancer stem cells, a tumor cell subpopulation that plays an instrumental role in long-term cancer maintenance, metastasis development and therapeutic resistance.

While tumor cell intrinsic STAT3 signaling provides a crucial axis to support cell proliferation and survival, it also regulates many activities of the non-transformed cells that collectively make up the tumor microenvironment. Accordingly, excessive activation of STAT3 is a hallmark of many malignancies, and often occurs in response to cytokines of the IL-6 and IL-10 families. However, tumor extrinsic STAT3 signaling also regulates the effector function of tumor-associated immune and stromal cells, which support the growth of tumors by suppressing the host\u2019s anti-tumor immune response.

Here we provide an update on novel insights into the role of STAT3 in immune suppression and describe current therapeutic strategies that target the JAK/STAT3 signaling axis for the treatment of malignancies.",

     "abstract": "Cell therapy is an advanced form of cancer immunotherapy that has had remarkable clinical progress in the past decade in the search for cure of cancer. Most success has been achieved for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells where CAR T-cells targeting CD19 show very high complete response rates for patients with refractory acute B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are close to approval for this indication. CD19 CAR T-cells are also effective against B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell lymphomas. Although encouraging, CAR T-cells have not yet proven clinically effective for solid tumors. This is mainly due to the lack of specific and homogenously expressed targets to direct the T-cells against and a hostile immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in solid tumors. Cancer vaccines based on dendritic cells (DC) are also making progress although clinical efficacy is still lacking. The likelihood of success is however increasing now when individual tumors can be sequences and patient-specific neoepitopes identified. Neoepitopes and/or neoantigens can then be included in patient-based DC vaccines. This review discusses recent advancements of DC vaccines and CAR T-cells with emphasis on the cancer-immunity cycle, and current efforts to design novel cell therapies.",

     "abstract": "Darwinian selection is also applicable when antibiotics, the immune system or other host factors shape the repertoire of microorganisms, and similarly, clonal selection is the hallmark of tumor evolution. The ongoing revolution in new anti-cancer treatment modalities, combined with an unprecedented precision in characterizing malignant clones at the level below one percent, profoundly improves the understanding of repertoire-tuning mechanisms. There is no fundamental difference between selection of the tumor cells in the presence, or absence, of therapy. However, under treatment the influence of a single agent can be measured, simplifying the analysis. Because of their beneficial and selective therapeutic effect, the focus in this review is set on protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs), predominantly tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). This is one of the most rapidly growing families of novel cancer medicines. In order to limit the number of drugs, the following representative target kinases are included: ALK, BCR-ABL, BRAF, BTK, and EGFR.A key therapeutic challenge is how to reduce tumor growth after treatment, since this is rate-limiting for the generation and expansion of more malignant escape mutants. Thus, upon efficient treatment, tumor cell loss often enables a profoundly increased growth rate among resistant cells. Strategies to reduce this risk, such as concomitant, competitive outgrowth of non-transformed cells, are described.Seven parameters: 1. Drug type, 2. tumor type, 3. presence of metastases or phenotypic change, 4. tumor cell number, 5. net growth rate (proliferation minus cell death), 6. inherited genetic- and 7. epigenetic- variations are crucial for drug responses. It is envisaged that it might become possible to calculate a clinically relevant Drug Resistance Index for Cancer (DRIC) for each patient.",

     "abstract": "There is a strong patient demand for early access to potentially beneficial cancer drugs. In line with this authorization agencies like the European Medicines Agency are providing drugs with conditional market authorisation based on positive interim analyses. This implies that drugs are used with insecure evidence of efficacy and adverse side-effects. Several authors have pointed to ethical problems with such a system but up to date no indepth ethical analysis of this system is found which is the aim of this article. Drawing of the four generally accepted principles of medical ethics: beneficence, nonmaleficence, respect for autonomy and justice the ethical pros and cons of conditional market authorisation are analysed. From the perspective of beneficence and non-maleficence it is found that the main problem is not risk of adverse side-effects to patients, but rather risk of less beneficial outcomes than what can be expected which could change incentives for patients' choice of treatment. This is also related to the extent to which patients might make an autonomous choice, especially taking into account problematic psychological attitudes and biases in medical decision-making. However, the main problem is related to justice and an equitable distribution of scarce health-care resources given the opportunity cost of drugs treatment. When using resources on cancer treatments which later might be found to be less efficacious than was first expected, other patients (in and outside the cancer field) are deprived of potentially more beneficial treatments even though their needs might be equally or more severe. At the same time, demanding more evidence has an ethical cost to patients in terms of depriving them of potential benefits in terms of reduced mortality and morbidity. In order to handle these ethical conflicts further research and analyses are required and it is suggested that pricing strategies and information requirements are alternatives to be further explored.",

Recent results suggest that the strict hierarchical structure of cancer cell populations advocated by the cancer stem cell model must be reconsidered since the depletion of cancer stem cells leads the other tumor cells to switch back into the cancer stem cell phenotype. This plasticity has important implications for metastasis since migrating cells do not need to be cancer stem cells in order to seed a metastasis. We also discuss the important role of the immune system and the microenvironment in modulating phenotypic switching and suggest possible avenues to exploit our understanding of this process to develop an effective strategy for precision medicine.",

CSC characteristics, such as self-renewal and tumour initiation, and supporting cellular processes, particularly the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, are attracting a great deal of attention from cancer researchers as they offer opportunities for discovering novel therapeutic targets for future drug development. However, the identification of potential CSC targets presents clear obstacles due to a lack of truly specific CSC markers and the reality of CSC plasticity, making this task a significant challenge. Agents that target developmental signalling pathways, such as Notch, Wnt and Hedgehog, are now in clinical trials whilst alternative approaches including immune-based therapies and microRNA-mediated pathway inhibitors are producing promising pre-clinical results. Here, we discuss the contribution of CSCs to cancer metastasis and the scope of opportunities for therapeutic intervention.

     "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an extremely aggressive neoplasm, predicted to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths before 2030. This dismal trend is mainly due to lack of effective treatments against its metastatic behavior. Therefore, a better understanding of the key mechanisms underlying metastasis should provide new opportunities for therapeutic purposes. Genomic analyses revealed that aberrations that fuel PDAC tumorigenesis and progression, such as SMAD4 loss, are also implicated in metastasis. Recently, microRNAs have been shown to play a regulatory role in the metastatic behavior of many tumors, including PDAC. In particular, miR-10 and miR-21 have appeared as master regulators of the metastatic program, while members of the miR-200 family are involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal switch, favoring cell migration and invasiveness. Several studies have also found a close relationship between cancer stem cells (CSCs) and biological features of metastasis, and the CSC markers ALDH1, ABCG2 and c-Met are expressed at high levels in metastatic PDAC cells. Emerging evidence reveals that exosomes are involved in the modulation of the tumor microenvironment and can initiate PDAC pre-metastatic niche formation in the liver and lungs. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of all these pivotal factors in the metastatic behavior of PDAC, and discuss their potential exploitation in the clinic to improve current therapeutics and identify new drug targets.",

Currently, pathologic complete response to nCRT is 20\u201330%, with a partial or no response in about 50% and 20%, respectively.

Ovarian cancer either develops from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE) or from serous intra-epithelial carcinoma (STIC).

Debulking surgery combined with first line platinum based chemotherapy, frequently leads to complete remission. However, most ovarian cancers relapse. Once the disease has relapsed, the interval between subsequent therapies decreases steadily due to rapid progression and therapy resistance.Research on therapy resistance of ovarian cancer is frequently devoted to genetic alterations in cancer cells, leading to drug inactivation, enhanced DNA repair mechanisms and intracellular pathway derangements. However the knowledge of ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSC) and the role they play in the development of cancer and therapy resistance is sparse.In this review current knowledge on the characteristics of OCSCs and the micro environmental mechanisms leading to the development or activation of OCSCs resulting in ovarian cancer is reviewed.

     "abstract": "Breast cancer ranks first among female cancer-related deaths in Western countries. As the primary tumor can often be controlled by surgical resection, the survival of women with breast cancer is closely linked to the incidence of distant metastases. Molecular screening by next generation sequencing highlighted the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of solid tumors as well as the clonal evolution of cancer cells during progression and under treatment pressure. Such findings question whether an optimal assessment of disease progression and a screening for druggable mutations should be based on molecular features of primary or recurrent/metastatic lesions and therefore represent a crucial element for failure or success of personalized medicine. In fact, new targeted therapies may induce only short-term benefit annulled by the emergence of resistant clones with new driver mutations which would need to be rapidly and reliably identified. Serial tissue sampling is therefore essential but, unfortunately, also represents a problem since biopsies from solid lesions, which are invasive and potentially painful and risky, cannot be easily repeatedly sampled, are inaccessible or may not fully reflect tumor heterogeneity. The need to early detect and strike this \u201cmoving target\u201d is now directing the scientific community toward liquid biopsy-based biomarkers, which include circulating tumor cells (CTC) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), can be repeatedly assessed through non-invasive and easy-to-perform procedures and may act as reliable read-outs of functional and molecular features of recurrent/metastatic lesions. In this review we summarize the outcome of CTCs and ctDNA in breast cancer, with special reference on their role on unveiling and overcoming tumor heterogeneity, on their potential relevance for tumor surveillance and monitoring, and for the selection of therapeutic options.

Preclinical research carried out in tumor experimental models, using both miRNA replacement and miRNA inhibitory approaches, is encouraging towards translating miRNA-based strategies into human cancer therapy, based on the observed therapeutic activity in the absence of main toxicity. However, to accelerate their adoption in the clinic, further improvements in terms of efficacy and targeted delivery to the tumor are still necessary.",

     "abstract": "Although altered glycosylation has been detected in human cancer cells decades ago, only investigations in the last years have enormously increased our knowledge about the details of protein glycosylation and its role in tumour progression. Many proteins, which are heavily glycosylated, i.e. adhesion proteins or proteases, play an important role in cancer metastasis that represents the crucial and frequently life-threatening step in progression of most tumour types. Compared to normal tissue, tumour cells often show altered glycosylation patters with appearance of new tumour-specific antigens. In this review, we give an overview about the role of glycosylation in tumour metastasis, describing recent results about O-glycans, N-glycans and glycosaminoglycans. We show that glycan structures, glycosylated proteins and glycosylation enzymes have influence on different steps of the metastatic process, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, invasion/intravasation and extravasation of tumour cells. Regarding the important role of cancer metastasis for patients survival, further knowledge about the consequences of altered glycosylation patterns in tumour cells is needed which might eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches.",

The metastatic potential of PDAC is one of the main reasons for the poor outcome next to lack of significant improvement in effective treatments in the last decade. Key mutated driver genes, such as activating KRAS mutations, are concordantly expressed in primary and metastatic tumors. However, the biology behind the metastatic potential of PDAC is not fully understood. Recently, large-scale omic approaches have revealed new mechanisms by which PDAC cells gain their metastatic potency. In particular, genomic studies have shown that multiple heterogeneous subclones reside in the primary tumor with different metastatic potential. The development of metastases may be correlated to a more mesenchymal transcriptomic subtype. However, for cancer cells to survive in a distant organ, metastatic sites need to be modulated into pre-metastatic niches. Proteomic studies identified the influence of exosomes on the Kuppfer cells in the liver, which could function to prepare this tissue for metastatic colonization. Phosphoproteomics adds an extra layer to the established omic techniques by unravelling key functional signaling. Future studies integrating results from these large-scale omic approaches will hopefully improve PDAC prognosis through identification of new therapeutic targets and patient selection tools. In this article, we will review the current knowledge on the biology of PDAC metastasis unravelled by large scale multi-omic approaches.",

The Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is a ubiquitously expressed acid-extruding membrane transport protein, and upregulation of its expression and/or activity is commonly correlated with tumor malignancy. The present review discusses current evidence on how altered pH homeostasis, and in particular NHE1, contributes to tumor cell motility, invasion, proliferation, and growth and facilitates evasion of chemotherapeutic cell death. We summarize data from in vitro studies, 2D-, 3D- and organotypic cell culture, animal models and human tissue, which collectively point to pH-regulation in general, and NHE1 in particular, as potential targets in combination chemotherapy.

As pH regulation is crucial for the maintenance of all biological functions, cancer cells rely on the activity of lactate exporters and proton transporters to regulate their intracellular pH. The major players in cancer pH regulation are proton pump ATPases, sodium-proton exchangers (NHEs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs), carbonic anhydrases (CAs) and anion exchangers (AEs), which have been shown to be upregulated in several human malignancies. Thanks to the activity of the proton pumps and transporters, tumours acidify their microenvironment, becoming more aggressive and resistant to therapy. Thus, targeting tumour pH may contribute to more effective anticancer strategies for controlling tumour progression and therapeutic resistance. In the present study, we review the role of the main pH regulators expressed in human cancer cells, including their diagnostic and prognostic value, as well as their usefulness as therapeutic targets.",

While some breast cancers are quite treatable, the triple-negative breast cancers are more metastatic and resistant to chemotherapy. There is clearly an urgent need for better treatments for this form of the disease. Breast cancer is characterized by genetically complex intra-tumour heterogeneity, particularly within the triple-negative clinical subtype. This complicates treatment options, so the development of specifically targeted chemotherapy for less treatable forms is critical. Dysregulation of pH homeostasis is a common factor in breast tumour cells. This occurs in concert with a metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis that occurs at the onset of oncogenic transformation. The Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) is the major pH regulatory protein involved in the increased proton extrusion of breast cancer cells. Its increased activity results in intracellular alkalinisation and extracellular acidification that drives cancer progression. The acidification of the extracellular tumour microenvironment also contributes to the development of chemotherapy resistance. In this review, we outline the role of H+ as a carcinogenic signal and the role and regulation of NHE1 as a trigger for metastasis. We review recent evidence supporting the use of pharmacological inhibitors of NHE1 as a viable treatment option for triple-negative breast cancer.",

Why a cancer cell would prefer to use energy inefficient glycolysis, leading to an alteration of pH both inside and outside of the cell, remains to be uncovered. The development of MDR represents a major challenge in the treatment of cancer and it is explained, so far, by the over expression of drug transporters such as the well-known and archetypal P-glycoprotein (Pgp). However, controversies exist regarding the function of Pgp in multi-drug resistance. We suggest here that Pgp-mediated MDR relies fundamentally on pH alterations mediated by the Warburg effect. Furthermore, we propose that the use of proton pump and/or transporters inhibitors (PPIs/PTIs) in cancer are key to controlling both MDR, i.e. sensitize tumors to antineoplastic agents, and drug-related adverse effects.",

This distinguishing tumour characteristic has been an area of intense study, as cellular pH (pHi) disturbances disrupt protein function and therefore multiple cellular processes. Tumour cells effectively utilise pHi regulating machinery present in normal cells with enhancements provided by additional oncogenic or hypoxia induced protein modifications. This overall improvement of pH regulation enables maintenance of an alkaline pHi in the continued presence of external acidification (pHe). Considerable experimentation has revealed targets that successfully disrupt tumour pHi regulation in efforts to develop novel means to weaken or kill tumour cells. However, redundancy in these pH-regulating proteins, which include Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs), carbonic anhydrases (CAs), Na+/HCO3\u2212 co-transporters (NBCs) and monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) has prevented effective disruption of tumour pHi when individual protein targeting is performed.

Indeed, microenvironmental acidity may differentially impact on diverse components of tumor immune surveillance, eventually contributing to immune escape and cancer progression. Although the molecular pathways underlying acidity-related immune dysfunctions are just emerging, initial evidence indicates that antitumor effectors such as T and NK cells tend to lose their function and undergo a state of mostly reversible anergy followed by apoptosis, when exposed to low pH environment. At opposite, immunosuppressive components such as myeloid cells and regulatory T cells are engaged by tumor acidity to sustain tumor growth while blocking antitumor immune responses. Local acidity could also profoundly influence bioactivity and distribution of antibodies, thus potentially interfering with the clinical efficacy of therapeutic antibodies including immune checkpoint inhibitors. Hence tumor acidity is a central regulator of cancer immunity that orchestrates both local and systemic immunosuppression and that may offer a broad panel of therapeutic targets.

To increase catabolism, the oxidative phosphorylation should be restored.

The activated pathway in lung ADC and SCC mainly focuses on MAPK and PI3K with different key genes of each, respectively, and the activated pathway of SCLC mainly focuses on JAK-STAT pathway. The diagnosis of lung cancer subtypes based on these genetic variations such as SNP was also evaluated. These results provide further insights into the different pathogenesis of lung cancer subtypes.",

The combinatorial cross-regulation of hundreds of biological function-specific transcription factors (TFs) is defined as the understanding of regulatory networks of molecules within the cell. Here we integrated global databases with 537 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (ADC), 140 with lung squamous carcinoma (SCC), 9 with lung large-cell carcinoma (LCC), 56 with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), and 590 without cancer with the understanding of TF functions.

About 5, 136, 52, or 16 up-regulated or 19, 24, 122, or 97down-regulated type-special TF genes were identified in ADC, SCC, LCC or SCLC, respectively.

In liver and colon tumors, SMYD3 is localized in the nucleus, where it interacts with RNA Pol II and H3K4me3 and functions as a selective transcriptional amplifier of oncogenes and genes that control cell proliferation and metastatic spread. Smyd3 expression has a high discriminative power for the characterization of liver tumors and positively correlates with poor prognosis. In lung and pancreatic cancer, SMYD3 acts in the cytoplasm, potentiating oncogenic Ras/ERK signaling through the methylation of the MAP3K2 kinase and the subsequent release from its inhibitor. A clinico-pathological analysis of lung cancer patients uncovers prognostic significance of SMYD3 only for first progression survival. However, stratification of patients according to their smoking history significantly expands the prognostic value of SMYD3 to overall survival and other features, suggesting that smoking-related effects saturate the clinical analysis and mask the function of SMYD3 as an oncogenic potentiator.",

Over the last 25 years, molecular mechanisms triggered by natural anticancer compounds were investigated. Emerging research showed that molecules of natural origins are useful for both preventive and therapeutic purposes by targeting essential hallmarks and enabling characteristics described by Hanahan and Weinberg. Moreover, natural compounds were able to change the differentiation status of selected cell types. One of the earliest response of cells treated by pharmacologically active compounds is the change of its morphology leading to ultra-structural perturbations: changes in membrane composition, cytoskeleton integrity, alterations of the endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria and of the nucleus lead to formation of morphological alterations that are a characteristic of both compound and cancer type preceding cell death. Apoptosis and autophagy were traditionally considered as the most prominent cell death or cell death-related mechanisms. By now multiple other cell death modalities were described and most likely involved in response to chemotherapeutic treatment. It can be hypothesized that especially necrosis-related phenotypes triggered by various treatments or evolving from apoptotic or autophagic mechanisms, provide a more efficient therapeutic outcome depending on cancer type and genetic phenotype of the patient. In fact, the recent discovery of multiple regulated forms of necrosis and the initial elucidation of the corresponding cell signaling pathways appear nowadays as important tools to clarify the immunogenic potential of non-canonical forms of cell death induction.",

One such whole food from Cucurbitaceae family is \u2018bitter melon\u2019 (Momordica charantia, also called bitter gourd, balsam apple, etc.), which has gained an enormous attention in recent years as an alternative medicine in developed countries. The increased focus on bitter melon consumption could in part be due to several recent pre-clinical efficacy studies demonstrating bitter melon potential to target obesity/type II diabetes-associated metabolic aberrations as well as its pre-clinical anti-cancer efficacy against various malignancies. The bioassay-guided fractionations have also classified the bitter melon chemical constituents based on their anti-diabetic or cytotoxic effects. Thus, by definition, these bitter melon constituents are at cross roads on the bioactivity parameters; they either have selective efficacy for correcting metabolic aberrations or targeting cancer cells, or have beneficial effects in both conditions. However, given the vast, though dispersed, literature reports on the bioactivity and beneficial attributes of bitter melon constituents, a comprehensive review on the bitter melon components and the overlapping beneficial attributes is lacking; our review attempts to fulfill these unmet needs. Importantly, the recent realization that there are common risk factors associated with obesity/type II diabetes-associated metabolic aberrations and cancer, this timely review focuses on the dual efficacy of bitter melon against the risk factors associated with both diseases that could potentially impact the course of malignancy to advanced stages. Furthermore, this review also addresses a significant gap in our knowledge regarding the bitter melon drug-drug interactions which can be predicted from the available reports on bitter melon effects on metabolism enzymes and drug transporters. This has important implications, given that a large proportion of individuals, taking bitter melon based supplements/phytochemical extracts/food based home-remedies, are also likely to be taking conventional therapeutic drugs at the same time. Accordingly, the comprehensively reviewed information here could be prudently translated to the clinical implications associated with any potential concerns regarding bitter melon consumption by cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "The implication of inflammatory tissue damage in pathophysiology of human cancer as well as some metabolic disorders has been under intense investigation. Numerous studies have identified a series of critical signaling molecules involved in cellular responses to inflammatory stimuli. These include nuclear factor \u03baB, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3, nuclear factor erythroid 2 p45-related factor 2 and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1. The proper regulation of these transcription factors mediating pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling hence provides an important strategy for the chemoprevention of inflammation-associated cancer. There is compelling evidence supporting that dietary supplementation with fish oil-derived \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) ameliorates symptomatic inflammation associated with cancer as well as other divergent human disorders. Acute or physiologic inflammation is an essential body\u2019s first line of defence to microbial infection and tissue injuries, but it must be properly completed by a process termed \u2018resolution\u2019. Failure of resolution mechanisms can result in persistence of inflammation, leading to chronic inflammatory conditions and related malignancies. The phagocytic engulfment of apoptotic neutrophils and clearance of their potentially histotoxic contents by macrophages, called efferocytosis is an essential component in resolving inflammation. Of note, DHA is a precursor of endogenous proresolving lipid mediators which regulate the leukocyte trafficking and recruitment and thereby facilitate efferocytosis. Therefore, DHA and its metabolites may have a preventive potential in the management of human cancer which arises as a consequence of impaired resolution of inflammation as well as chronic inflammation.",

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa), a hormonally-driven cancer, ranks first in incidence and second in cancer related mortality in men in most Western industrialized countries. Androgen and androgen receptor (AR) are the dominant modulators of PCa growth. Over the last two decades multiple advancements in screening, treatment, surveillance and palliative care of PCa have significantly increased quality of life and survival following diagnosis. However, over 20% of patients initially diagnosed with PCa still develop an aggressive and treatment-refractory disease. Prevention or treatment for hormone-refractory PCa using bioactive compounds from marine sponges, mushrooms, and edible plants either as single agents or as adjuvants to existing therapy, has not been clinically successful. Major advancements have been made in the identification, testing and modification of the existing molecular structures of natural products. Additionally, conjugation of these compounds to novel matrices has enhanced their bio-availability; a big step towards bringing natural products to clinical trials. Natural products derived from edible plants (nutraceuticals), and common folk-medicines might offer advantages over synthetic compounds due to their broader range of targets, as compared to mostly single target synthetic anticancer compounds; e.g. kinase inhibitors. The use of synthetic inhibitors or antibodies that target a single aberrant molecule in cancer cells might be in part responsible for emergence of treatment refractory cancers. Nutraceuticals that target AR signaling (epigallocatechin gallate [EGCG], curcumin, and 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors), AR synthesis (ericifolin, capsaicin and others) or AR degradation (betulinic acid, di-indolyl diamine, sulphoraphane, silibinin and others) are prime candidates for use as adjuvant or mono-therapies. Nutraceuticals target multiple pathophysiological mechanisms involved during cancer development and progression and thus have potential to simultaneously inhibit both prostate cancer growth and metastatic progression (e.g., inhibition of angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and proliferation). Given their multi-targeting properties along with relatively lower systemic toxicity, these compounds offer significant therapeutic advantages for prevention and treatment of PCa. This review emphasizes the potential application of some of the well-researched natural compounds that target AR for prevention and therapy of PCa.",

Many natural products and bioactive compounds found in foods have been shown to inhibit breast carcinogenesis via inhibition of estrogen induced oxidative stress as well as ER signaling. This review summarizes the role of bioactive natural products that are involved in the prevention and treatment of estrogen-related and ER-positive breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed in women worldwide and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the USA. Despite the development of newer diagnostic methods, selective as well as targeted chemotherapies and their combinations, surgery, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy, breast cancer recurrence, metastasis and drug resistance are still the major problems for breast cancer. Emerging evidence suggest the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), a population of cells with the capacity to self-renew, differentiate and be capable of initiating and sustaining tumor growth. In addition, CSCs are believed to be responsible for cancer recurrence, anticancer drug resistance, and metastasis. Hence, compounds targeting breast CSCs may be better therapeutic agents for treating breast cancer and control recurrence and metastasis. Naturally occurring compounds, mainly phytochemicals have gained immense attention in recent times because of their wide safety profile, ability to target heterogeneous populations of cancer cells as well as CSCs, and their key signaling pathways. Therefore, in the present review article, we summarize our current understanding of breast CSCs and their signaling pathways, and the phytochemicals that affect these cells including curcumin, resveratrol, tea polyphenols (epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin), sulforaphane, genistein, indole-3-carbinol, 3, 3\u2032-di-indolylmethane, vitamin E, retinoic acid, quercetin, parthenolide, triptolide, 6-shogaol, pterostilbene, isoliquiritigenin, celastrol, and koenimbin. These phytochemicals may serve as novel therapeutic agents for breast cancer treatment and future leads for drug development.",

     "abstract": "Globally, breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women. The major unresolved problems with metastatic breast cancer is recurrence after receiving objective response to chemotherapy, drug-induced side effects of first line chemotherapy and delayed response to second line of treatment. Unfortunately, very few options are available as third line treatment. It is clear that under such circumstances there is an urgent need for new and effective drugs. Phytochemicals are among the most promising chemopreventive treatment options for the management of cancer. Resveratrol (3,5,4\u2032-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a non-flavonoid polyphenol present in several dietary sources, including grapes, berries, soy beans, pomegranate and peanuts, has been shown to possess a wide range of health benefits through its effect on a plethora of molecular targets.The present review encompasses the role of resveratrol and its natural/synthetic analogue in the light of their efficacy against tumor cell proliferation, metastasis, epigenetic alterations and for induction of apoptosis as well as sensitization toward chemotherapeutic drugs in various in vitro and in vivo models of breast cancer. The roles of resveratrol as a phytoestrogen, an aromatase inhibitor and in stem cell therapy as well as adjuvent treatment are also discussed. This review explores the full potential of resveratrol in breast cancer prevention and treatment with current limitations, challenges and future directions of research.",

In general the lack of systemic toxicities of most \u2018whole\u2019 and \u2018isolated\u2019 natural compounds, their potential to reduce toxic doses and potential to delay the development of drug-resistance makes them promising candidates for cancer management. This review article examines the suggested molecular mechanisms affected by these substances focusing to a large extent on prostate cancer and deliberates on the disparate results obtained from cell culture, preclinical and clinical studies in an effort to highlight the use of whole extracts and isolated constituents for intervention. As such these studies underscore the importance of factors such as treatment duration, bioavailability, route of administration, selection criteria, standardized formulation and clinical end points in clinical trial design with both entities. Overall lack of parallel comparison studies between the whole natural products and their isolated compounds limits decisive conclusions regarding the superior utility of one over the other. We suggest the critical need for rigorous comparative research to identify which one of the two or both entities from nature would be best qualified to take on the mantle of cancer management.",

Due to their cellular origin and the pivotal role of NF-\u03baB for the normal function of B lymphocytes, B-cell malignancies are particularly prone to genetic aberrations that affect the pathway. Key positive regulators of NF-\u03baB signaling can act as oncogenes that are often prone to chromosomal translocation, amplifications or activating mutations. Negative regulators of NF-\u03baB have tumor suppressor functions and are frequently inactivated either by genomic deletions or point mutations. Whereas some aberrations are found in a variety of different lymphoid malignancies, some oncogenic alterations are very restricted to distinct lymphoma subsets, reflecting the clonal and cellular origin of specific lymphoma entities. NF-\u03baB activation in many lymphoma cells is also driven by the microenvironment or chronic signaling that does not rely on genetic alterations. A number of drugs that target the NF-\u03baB pathway are in preclinical or clinical development, revealing that there will be new options for therapies in the future. Since each lymphoma entity utilizes distinct mechanisms to activate NF-\u03baB, a major challenge is to elucidate the exact pathological processes in order to faithfully predict clinical responses to the different therapeutic approaches.",

Hence, it is not paradoxical that, similar to their normal counterparts, most mature B cell lymphoma subtypes are critically dependent on microenvironmental cues. Such external signals are sensed by various receptors present on the malignant cells, including the Toll-like receptors (TLRs), eliciting a range of cellular responses, including proliferation but also anergy and apoptosis, often with disease-specific patterns. Critically, the TLR signaling pathways are intertwined with other receptor pathways in malignant B cells, most notably the B-cell receptor pathway, and converge on NF-\u03baB, leading to its activation. In the present review, we summarize the literature on TLR expression and functionality and its impact on NF-\u03baB activation in different B cell malignancies including chronic lymphocytic leukemia where TLR9 induces activation, cell proliferation and chemoresistance in a proportion of patients while apoptosis can be induced in others.

These studies revealed the presence of multiple oncogenic alterations dysregulating signal transduction pathways that are normally required for the normal biology of the cells from which these tumors are derived. Among the pathways identified as recurrent targets of genetic lesions in DLBCL, NF-\u03baB has emerged as a central player in the development and maintenance of this disease, particularly in the less curable, activated B cell (ABC)- like subtype. These lesions reveal vulnerabilities of the lymphoma cells that can be exploited for the design of more rationale therapeutic approaches. The purpose of this review is to summarize recent progresses in understanding the role of NF-\u03baB deregulation in the pathogenesis of DLBCL, with emphasis on the genetic basis underlying its aberrant activation, in relationship to the normal biology of B lymphocytes, and the modelling of these lesions in the mouse.",

In Epstein-Barr virus-positive cases of classical HL, the virus-encoded latent membrane protein 1 causes NF-\u03baB activation by mimicking an active CD40 receptor.

On the other hand, CLL B cells seem \u2018addicted\u2019 to the tumor microenvironment for their survival and proliferation, which is primarily mediated by interaction through a number of cell surface receptors, e.g. the B-cell receptor (BcR), Toll-like receptors and CD40, that in turn activate downstream NF-\u03baB.

In other words, CLL can be considered a prototype disease for studying the intricate interplay between external triggers and intrinsic aberrations and their combined impact on disease evolution. In this review, we will discuss the current understanding of mechanisms underlying NF-\u03baB deregulation in CLL, including micro-environmental, genetic and epigenetic events, and summarize data generated in murine models resembling human CLL.

     "abstract": "Extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma) invariably arises from a background of chronic microbial infection and/or autoimmune disorder at diverse mucosal sites. The prolonged chronic infection and/or autoimmunity generate active immune and inflammatory responses that provide a setting for evolution and development of autoreactive B-cells, their expansion and eventual malignant transformation following acquisition of genetic changes. The immune responses also play a critical role in sustaining the growth and survival of the transformed cells as shown by complete regression of a high proportion of MALT lymphoma of the stomach, ocular adnexa and skin following anti-microbial treatment. B-cell receptor engagement by auto-antigen as well as T-cell help including both cognate interaction and bystander help via soluble ligands such as CD40L and BAFF are thought to underpin the immunological drive in the lymphoma development through activation of the canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathway respectively. Similarly, the three MALT lymphoma associated chromosome translocations, namely t(1;14)(p22;q32)/BCL10-IGH, t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1,and t(11;18)(q21;q21)/BIRC3 (API2)-MALT1, are also capable of activating both canonical and non-canonical NF-\u03baB pathways. Furthermore, TNFAIP3 (A20) inactivation by deletion and/or mutation abolishes the auto-negative feedback to several signalling including BCR and TLR, which connect to the canonical NF-\u03baB activation pathway. Thus, there is a considerable overlap in the molecular pathways dysregulated by immunological drive and somatic genetic changes, strongly arguing for their oncogenic cooperation in the development of MALT lymphoma.",

While larger nucleolar size and number have been recognized as hallmark features of many tumor types, recent evidence has suggested that, in addition to overproduction of ribosomes, decreased ribosome biogenesis as well as qualitative changes in this process could also contribute to tumor initiation and cancer progression. Furthermore, the nucleolus has become the focus of intense attention for its involvement in processes that are clearly unrelated to ribosome biogenesis such as sensing and responding to endogenous and exogenous stressors, maintenance of genome stability, regulation of cell-cycle progression, cellular senescence, telomere function, chromatin structure, establishment of nuclear architecture, global regulation of gene expression and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein particles. The fact that dysregulation of many of these fundamental cellular processes may contribute to the malignant phenotype suggests that normal functioning of the nucleolus safeguards against the development of cancer and indicates its potential as a therapeutic approach.

     "abstract": "This review is aimed at the issue of radiation-induced second malignant neoplasms (SMN), which has become an important problem with the increasing success of modern cancer radiotherapy (RT). It is imperative to avoid compromising the therapeutic ratio while addressing the challenge of SMN. The dilemma is illustrated by the role of reactive oxygen species in both the mechanisms of tumor cell kill and of radiation-induced carcinogenesis.We explore the literature focusing on three potential routes of amelioration to address this challenge. An obvious approach to avoiding compromise of the tumor response is the use of radioprotectors or mitigators that are selective for normal tissues. We also explore the opportunities to avoid protection of the tumor by topical/regional radioprotection of normal tissues, although this strategy limits the scope of protection. Finally, we explore the role of the bystander/abscopal phenomenon in radiation carcinogenesis, in association with the inflammatory response. Targeted and non-targeted effects of radiation are both linked to SMN through induction of DNA damage, genome instability and mutagenesis, but differences in the mechanisms and kinetics between targeted and non-targeted effects may provide opportunities to lessen SMN. The agents that could be employed to pursue each of these strategies are briefly reviewed.

     "abstract": "Exposure of cells to any form of ionizing radiation (IR) is expected to induce a variety of DNA lesions, including double strand breaks (DSBs), single strand breaks (SSBs) and oxidized bases, as well as loss of bases, i.e., abasic sites. The damaging potential of IR is primarily related to the generation of electrons, which through their interaction with water produce free radicals. In their turn, free radicals attack DNA, proteins and lipids. Damage is induced also through direct deposition of energy. These types of IR interactions with biological materials are collectively called \u2ffftargeted effects\u2fff, since they refer only to the irradiated cells. Earlier and sometimes \u2fffanecdotal\u2fff findings were pointing to the possibility of IR actions unrelated to the irradiated cells or area, i.e., a type of systemic response with unknown mechanistic basis. Over the last years, significant experimental evidence has accumulated, showing a variety of radiation effects for \u2fffout-of-field\u2fff areas (non-targeted effects-NTE). The NTE involve the release of chemical and biological mediators from the \u2fffin-field\u2fff area and thus the communication of the radiation insult via the so called \u2fffdanger\u2fff signals. The NTE can be separated in two major groups: bystander and distant (systemic). In this review, we have collected a detailed list of proteins implicated in either bystander or systemic effects, including the clinically relevant abscopal phenomenon, using improved text-mining and bioinformatics tools from the literature. We have identified which of these genes belong to the DNA damage response and repair pathway (DDR/R) and made protein\u2fffprotein interaction (PPi) networks. Our analysis supports that the apoptosis, TLR-like and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways are the main pathways participating in NTE. Based on this analysis, we formulate a biophysical hypothesis for the regulation of NTE, based on DNA damage and apoptosis gradients between the irradiation point and various distances corresponding to bystander (5\u00a0mm) or distant effects (5\u00a0cm). Last but not least, in order to provide a more realistic support for our model, we calculate the expected DSB and non-DSB clusters along the central axis of a representative 200.6\u00a0MeV pencil beam calculated using Monte Carlo DNA damage simulation software (MCDS) based on the actual beam energy-to-depth curves used in therapy.",

Such therapeutic strategy has gained even more popularity (over the last few decades) since various studies have shed light into understanding hyperthermia's underlying molecular mechanism(s) of action. In general, hyperthermia is applied as complementary (adjuvant) means in therapeutic protocols combining chemotherapy and/or irradiation both of which can induce irreversible cellular DNA damage. Furthermore, according to a number of in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, hyperthermia has been shown to enhance the beneficial effects of DNA targeting therapeutic strategies by interfering with DNA repair response cascades. Therefore, the continuously growing evidence supporting hyperthermia's beneficial role in cancer treatment can also encourage its application as a DNA repair mitigation strategy. In this review article, we aim to provide detailed information on how hyperthermia acts on DNA damage and repair pathways and thus potentially contributing to various adjuvant therapeutic protocols relevant to more efficient cancer treatment strategies.",

E3 ubiquitin ligases are essential components of the UPS machinery, working with E1 and E2 enzymes to bind substrates and assist the transport of ubiquitin molecules onto the target protein. As the UPS controls the degradation of several oncogenes and tumor suppressors, dysregulation of this pathway leads to several human malignancies. A major category of E3 Ub ligases, the SCF (Skp\u2013Cullin\u2013F-box) complex, is composed of four principal components: Skp1, Cul1/Cdc53, Roc1/Rbx1/Hrt1, and an F-box protein (FBP). FBPs are the substrate recognition components of SCF complexes and function as adaptors that bring substrates into physical proximity with the rest of the SCF. Besides acting as a component of SCF complexes, FBPs are involved in DNA replication, transcription, cell differentiation and cell death.This review will highlight the recent literature on three well characterized FBPs SKP2, Fbw7, and beta-TRCP. In particular, we will focus on the involvement of these deregulated FBPs in the progression and development of various human cancers.

Specific EMT transcription factors (EMT-TFs), such as Snail, Slug, Twist and Zeb, control EMT induction both during development and in cancer. These EMT-TFs are short-lived proteins that are targeted to the proteasome system by specific F-box proteins, keeping them at low levels. F-box proteins also indirectly regulate the EMT process by controlling EMT inducers, such as Notch, c-Myc or mTOR.

In general, oncogenic miRNAs are upregulated in cancer, while miRNAs that act as tumor suppressors are downregulated, leading to decreased expression of tumor suppressors and upregulated oncogene expression, respectively. F-box proteins function as the substrate-recognition components of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF)-ubiquitin ligase complex for the degradation of their protein targets by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Therefore F-box proteins and miRNAs both negatively regulate target gene expression post-transcriptionally. Since each miRNA is capable of fine-tuning the expression of multiple target genes, multiple F-box proteins may be suppressed by the same miRNA. Meanwhile, one F-box proteins could be regulated by several miRNAs in different cancer types. In this review, we will focus on miRNA-mediated downregulation of various F-box proteins, the resulting stabilization of F-box protein substrates and the impact of these processes on human malignancies. We provide insight into how the miRNA: F-box protein axis may regulate cancer progression and metastasis.

It exerts predominantly cytoprotective effects by removing damaged organelles and protein aggregates. In cancer, however, autophagy acts as both a tumor suppressor by preventing ROS-induced tumorigenesis and as a tumor inducer by providing nutrients to tumor cells under hypoxic, low-energy conditions and protecting them against therapeutically induced stress. Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma is an extremely lethal and aggressive neoplasm with a 5 year-survival rate between 1% and 5%. One of the most important factors affecting its poor prognosis is its high resistance to most of the existing chemotherapeutic regimens. The role of autophagy in PDAC has been investigated by different research groups and the results are quite divergent; some research lines point at autophagy as a tumor promoting mechanism, whereas other studies assign oncosuppressive functions to it. Nevertheless, several distinct preclinical studies and clinical trials have evaluated the efficacy of both autophagy inducers and autophagy inhibitors as therapeutic compounds against PDAC, many of them providing promising results. Although a better understanding of the complexity of autophagy is needed, the modulation of this process opens new opportunities for prognostic and therapeutic purposes.",

     "abstract": "Cancer patients without metastasis are generally considered as candidates for curative localized radiation therapy. However, while the benefits of localized radiation have been demonstrated by many clinical studies, recurrences or distant metastases that develop after local treatment remain a major therapeutic challenge. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have reported that irradiation may subsequently alter tumor aggression by reducing or promoting the invasiveness of the remaining cancer cells after radiation, which appears to differ depending on the form of radiation, as well as the investigated cell lines. Cell lines recapitulate cancer heterogeneity based on the characteristics reflected in their genetic abnormalities, and thus can be used as a tool to investigate the genetic basis of cancer aggression. Importantly, molecular insights into this process would allow us to tailor drug treatments for use in combination with local radiation treatment. This review summarizes the diverse responses of cancer cell invasiveness induced by radiation, and discusses the possible molecular pathways and the genetic variations that may affect radiation-altered invasion.",

     "abstract": "Oncology has benefited from an increasingly growing number of groundbreaking innovations over the last decade. Targeted therapies, biotherapies, and the most recent immunotherapies all contribute to increase the number of therapeutic options for cancer patients. Consequently, substantial improvements in clinical outcomes for some disease with dismal prognosis such as lung carcinoma or melanoma have been achieved. Of note, the latest innovations in targeted therapies or biotherapies do not preclude the use of standard cytotoxic agents, mostly used in combination. Importantly, and despite the rise of bioguided (a.k.a. precision) medicine, the administration of chemotherapeutic agents still relies on the maximum tolerated drug (MTD) paradigm, a concept inherited from theories conceptualized nearly half a century ago. Alternative dosing schedules such as metronomic regimens, based upon the repeated and regular administration of low doses of chemotherapeutic drugs, and adaptive therapy (i.e. modulating the dose and frequency of cytotoxics administration to control disease progression rather than eradicate it at all cost) have emerged as possible strategies to improve response rates while reducing toxicities. The recent changes in paradigm in the way we theorize cancer biology and evolution, metastatic spreading and tumor ecology, alongside the recent advances in the field of immunotherapy, have considerably strengthened the interest for these alternative approaches. This paper aims at reviewing the recent evolutions in the field of theoretical biology of cancer and computational oncology, with a focus on the consequences these changes have on the way we administer chemotherapy. Here, we advocate for the development of model-guided strategies to refine doses and schedules of chemotherapy administration in order to achieve precision medicine in oncology.",

     "abstract": "The tumour microenvironment contributes greatly to the response of tumour cells. It consists of chemical gradients, for example of oxygen and nutrients. However, a physical environment is also present. Apart from chemical input, cells also receive physical signals. Tumours display unique mechanical properties: they are a lot stiffer than normal tissue. This may be either a cause or a consequence of cancer, but literature suggests it has a major impact on tumour cells as will be described in this review. The mechanical microenvironment may cause malignant transformation, possibly through activation of oncogenic pathways and inhibition of tumour suppressor genes. In addition, the mechanical microenvironment may promote tumour progression by influencing processes such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, enhancing cell survival through autophagy, but also affects sensitivity of tumour cells to therapeutics. Furthermore, multiple intracellular signalling pathways prove sensitive to the mechanical properties of the microenvironment.It appears the increased stiffness is unlikely to be caused by increased stiffness of the tumour cells themselves. However, there are indications that tumours display a higher cell density, making them more rigid. In addition, increased matrix deposition in the tumour, as well as increased interstitial fluid pressure may account for the increased stiffness of tumours.Overall, tumour mechanics are significantly different from normal tissue. Therefore, this feature should be further explored for use in cancer prevention, detection and treatment.",

In this review, the physiological functions of CatK are presented and compared to its potential role in pathobiolology of processes associated with tumour growth, invasion and metastasis of cancer cells and their interactions with the tumour microenvironment. CatK activity is either indirectly affecting signalling pathways, or directly degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, for example in bone metastases. Recently, CatK was also found in glioma, possibly regulating cancer stem-like cell mobilisation and modulating recently found physiological CatK substrates, including chemokines and growth factors. Moreover, CatK may be useful in differential diagnosis and may have prognostic value. Finally, the application of CatK inhibitors, which are already in clinical trials for treatment of osteoporosis, has a potential to attenuate cancer aggressiveness.",

The first part of this article will shortly describe the technology and strategies to quantify and dissect the heterogeneity in human solid cancers. Moreover, there is urgent need to better understand human cancer biology since the development of novel anti-cancer drugs is far from being efficient, predominantly due to the scarcity of predictive preclinical models. Hence, in vivo and in vitro models were developed, which better recapitulate the complexity of human cancers, by their intrinsic three-dimensional nature and the cellular heterogeneity and allow functional intervention for hypothesis testing.

Urothelial carcinoma is by far the most common histologic type of bladder cancer and may also arise from the upper urinary tract, e.g. renal pelvis and ureter, as well as from the proximal urethra. There have been no major advances in the development of new systemic therapies for urothelial carcinoma for over two decades, which may be related to prior lack of profound comprehension of biological pathogenetic mechanisms. However, in the last few years there has been a major shift in the development of new promising therapies that stem from improved molecular profiling of this malignancy. Developments in molecular biology, genomics, bioinformatics and immunology provide a solid foundation for therapeutic advances. A plethora of novel treatment targets and biomarkers are being evaluated, but there has been no molecular biomarker with established clinical utility so far. Genomic characterization of each patient's tumor has not been implemented due to the high cost, lack of validated standardized techniques that could be available in different laboratories, as well as absence of validated biomarkers and available therapeutic agents with clinically proven benefit. However, genomic characterization before treatment has now started to be implemented in novel clinical trial designs in order to contribute to proper patient selection based on biomarker-based enrichment strategies. Several \u201cumbrella\u201d or \u201cbasket\u201d type, molecular biomarkers-based trials, in which patient eligibility and/or stratification is based on the presence of specific genetic alterations regardless of tissue of origin and/or histology, are being launched. Mathematical models and bioinformatics platforms that perform high level computational integrated pathway analysis may reveal clinical relevant signaling pathways amenable for targeting in individual patient tumors. Moreover, the high mutational burden of urothelial carcinoma may create numerous neo-antigens that may explain the very promising results with immune checkpoint inhibitors in early phase clinical trials. A combination of several, e.g. DNA, mRNA, miRNA, protein, and other molecular biomarkers merit further investigation, but this process has to be based on stringent criteria that test and prove clinical utility.",

     "abstract": "The Hedgehog-GLI (HH-GLI) signaling is of critical importance during embryonic development, where it regulates a number of cellular processes, including patterning, proliferation and differentiation. Its aberrant activation has been linked to several types of cancer. HH-GLI signaling is triggered by binding of ligands to the transmembrane receptor patched and is subsequently mediated by transcriptional effectors belonging to the GLI family, whose function is fine tuned by a series of molecular interactions and modifications. Several HH-GLI inhibitors have been developed and are in clinical trials. Similarly, the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are involved in a number of biological processes and play an important role in many diseases including cancer. Inhibiting molecules targeting MAPK signaling, especially those elicited by the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway, have been developed and are moving into clinical trials. ERK1/2 may be activated as a consequence of aberrant activation of upstream signaling molecules or during development of drug resistance following treatment with kinase inhibitors such as those for PI3K or BRAF. Evidence of a crosstalk between HH-GLI and other oncogenic signaling pathways has been reported in many tumor types, as shown by recent reviews. Here we will focus on the interaction between HH-GLI and the final MAPK effectors ERK1/2, p38 and JNK in cancer in view of its possible implications for cancer therapy. Several reports highlight the existence of a consistent crosstalk between HH signaling and MAPK, especially with the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway, and this fact should be taken into consideration for designing optimal treatment and prevent tumor relapse.",

Hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is correlated with tumor development, progression, poor prognosis, and resistance to cancer therapies, such as radiotherapy, in human solid tumors. Akt/PKB (Protein Kinase B) members are the major kinases that act downstream of PI3K, and these are involved in a variety of cellular functions, including growth, proliferation, glucose metabolism, invasion, metastasis, angiogenesis, and survival. Accumulating evidence indicates that activated Akt is one of the major predictive markers for solid tumor responsiveness to chemo/radiotherapy. DNA double-strand breaks (DNA-DSB), are the prime cause of cell death induced by ionizing radiation. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies have shown that constitutive activation of Akt and stress-induced activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway accelerate the repair of DNA-DSB and, consequently, lead to therapy resistance. Analyzing dysregulations of Akt, such as point mutations, gene amplification or overexpression, which results in the constitutive activation of Akt, might be of special importance in the context of radiotherapy outcomes. Such studies, as well as studies of the mechanism(s) by which activated Akt1 regulates repair of DNA-DSB, might help to identify combinations using the appropriate molecular targeting strategies with conventional radiotherapy to overcome radioresistance in solid tumors. In this review, we discuss the dysregulation of the components of upstream regulators of Akt as well as specific modifications of Akt isoforms that enhance Akt activity. Likewise, the mechanisms by which Akt interferes with repair of DNA after exposure to ionizing radiation, will be reviewed. Finally, the current status of Akt targeting in combination with radiotherapy will be discussed.",

Here, we first review the evidence that primitive stem cells in adult tissues are quiescent and generally smaller than their differentiated progeny, suggesting a correlation between small cell sizes with the stemness. Conversely, increased cell size positively correlates with differentiation phenotypes. We then discuss cancer stem cells (CSCs) and present some evidence that correlates cell sizes with CSC activity. Overall, a causal link between CSCs and cell size is relatively weak and remains to be rigorously assessed.

Genomic instability arises from many different pathways, such as telomere damage, centrosome amplification, epigenetic modifications, and DNA damage from endogenous and exogenous sources, and can be perpetuating, or limiting, through the induction of mutations or aneuploidy, both enabling and catastrophic. Many cancer treatments induce DNA damage to impair cell division on a global scale but it is accepted that personalized treatments, those that are tailored to the particular patient and type of cancer, must also be developed. In this review, we detail the mechanisms from which genomic instability arises and can lead to cancer, as well as treatments and measures that prevent genomic instability or take advantage of the cellular defects caused by genomic instability. In particular, we identify and discuss five priority targets against genomic instability: (1) prevention of DNA damage; (2) enhancement of DNA repair; (3) targeting deficient DNA repair; (4) impairing centrosome clustering; and, (5) inhibition of telomerase activity.

Early steps in tumor development are associated with a fibrogenic response and the development of a hypoxic environment which favors the survival and proliferation of cancer stem cells. Part of the survival strategy of cancer stem cells may manifested by alterations in cell metabolism. Once tumors appear, growth and metastasis may be supported by overproduction of appropriate hormones (in hormonally dependent cancers), by promoting angiogenesis, by undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, by triggering autophagy, and by taking cues from surrounding stromal cells. A number of natural compounds (e.g., curcumin, resveratrol, indole-3-carbinol, brassinin, sulforaphane, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, genistein, ellagitannins, lycopene and quercetin) have been found to inhibit one or more pathways that contribute to proliferation (e.g., hypoxia inducible factor 1, nuclear factor kappa B, phosphoinositide 3 kinase/Akt, insulin-like growth factor receptor 1, Wnt, cell cycle associated proteins, as well as androgen and estrogen receptor signaling).

Aberrations in these processes in cancer cells involve mutations and thus the suppression of genes that prevent growth, as well as mutation and activation of genes involved in driving cell growth. Using these pathways as examples, we prioritize molecular targets that might be leveraged to promote anti-growth signaling in cancer cells. Interestingly, naturally occurring phytochemicals found in human diets (either singly or as mixtures) may promote anti-growth signaling, and do so without the potentially adverse effects associated with synthetic chemicals. We review examples of naturally occurring phytochemicals that may be applied to prevent cancer by antagonizing growth signaling, and propose one phytochemical for each pathway. These are: epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) for the Rb pathway, luteolin for p53, curcumin for PTEN, porphyrins for Hippo, genistein for GDF15, resveratrol for ARID1A, withaferin A for Notch and diguelin for the IGF1-receptor pathway. The coordination of anti-growth signaling and natural compound studies will provide insight into the future application of these compounds in the clinical setting.",

     "abstract": "Apoptosis or programmed cell death is natural way of removing aged cells from the body. Most of the anti-cancer therapies trigger apoptosis induction and related cell death networks to eliminate malignant cells. However, in cancer, de-regulated apoptotic signaling, particularly the activation of an anti-apoptotic systems, allows cancer cells to escape this program leading to uncontrolled proliferation resulting in tumor survival, therapeutic resistance and recurrence of cancer. This resistance is a complicated phenomenon that emanates from the interactions of various molecules and signaling pathways. In this comprehensive review we discuss the various factors contributing to apoptosis resistance in cancers. The key resistance targets that are discussed include (1) Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 proteins; (2) autophagy processes; (3) necrosis and necroptosis; (4) heat shock protein signaling; (5) the proteasome pathway; (6) epigenetic mechanisms; and (7) aberrant nuclear export signaling. The shortcomings of current therapeutic modalities are highlighted and a broad spectrum strategy using approaches including (a) gossypol; (b) epigallocatechin-3-gallate; (c) UMI-77 (d) triptolide and (e) selinexor that can be used to overcome cell death resistance is presented. This review provides a roadmap for the design of successful anti-cancer strategies that overcome resistance to apoptosis for better therapeutic outcome in patients with cancer.",

     "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of malignant cell populations is the ability to undergo continuous proliferation. This property allows clonal lineages to acquire sequential aberrations that can fuel increasingly autonomous growth, invasiveness, and therapeutic resistance. Innate cellular mechanisms have evolved to regulate replicative potential as a hedge against malignant progression. When activated in the absence of normal terminal differentiation cues, these mechanisms can result in a state of persistent cytostasis. This state, termed \u201csenescence,\u201d can be triggered by intrinsic cellular processes such as telomere dysfunction and oncogene expression, and by exogenous factors such as DNA damaging agents or oxidative environments. Despite differences in upstream signaling, senescence often involves convergent interdependent activation of tumor suppressors p53 and p16/pRB, but can be induced, albeit with reduced sensitivity, when these suppressors are compromised. Doses of conventional genotoxic drugs required to achieve cancer cell senescence are often much lower than doses required to achieve outright cell death. Additional therapies, such as those targeting cyclin dependent kinases or components of the PI3K signaling pathway, may induce senescence specifically in cancer cells by circumventing defects in tumor suppressor pathways or exploiting cancer cells\u2019 heightened requirements for telomerase. Such treatments sufficient to induce cancer cell senescence could provide increased patient survival with fewer and less severe side effects than conventional cytotoxic regimens. This positive aspect is countered by important caveats regarding senescence reversibility, genomic instability, and paracrine effects that may increase heterogeneity and adaptive resistance of surviving cancer cells. Nevertheless, agents that effectively disrupt replicative immortality will likely be valuable components of new combinatorial approaches to cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Cancer is a disease characterized by unrestrained cellular proliferation. In order to sustain growth, cancer cells undergo a complex metabolic rearrangement characterized by changes in metabolic pathways involved in energy production and biosynthetic processes. The relevance of the metabolic transformation of cancer cells has been recently included in the updated version of the review \u201cHallmarks of Cancer\u201d, where dysregulation of cellular metabolism was included as an emerging hallmark. While several lines of evidence suggest that metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the concerted action of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, in some circumstances altered metabolism can play a primary role in oncogenesis. Recently, mutations of cytosolic and mitochondrial enzymes involved in key metabolic pathways have been associated with hereditary and sporadic forms of cancer. Together, these results demonstrate that aberrant metabolism, once seen just as an epiphenomenon of oncogenic reprogramming, plays a key role in oncogenesis with the power to control both genetic and epigenetic events in cells. In this review, we discuss the relationship between metabolism and cancer, as part of a larger effort to identify a broad-spectrum of therapeutic approaches. We focus on major alterations in nutrient metabolism and the emerging link between metabolism and epigenetics. Finally, we discuss potential strategies to manipulate metabolism in cancer and tradeoffs that should be considered.

Although considerable progress has been made in understanding how cancers evade destructive immunity, measures to counteract tumor escape have not kept pace. There are a number of factors that contribute to tumor persistence despite having a normal host immune system. Immune editing is one of the key aspects why tumors evade surveillance causing the tumors to lie dormant in patients for years through \u201cequilibrium\u201d and \u201csenescence\u201d before re-emerging. In addition, tumors exploit several immunological processes such as targeting the regulatory T cell function or their secretions, antigen presentation, modifying the production of immune suppressive mediators, tolerance and immune deviation. Besides these, tumor heterogeneity and metastasis also play a critical role in tumor growth. A number of potential targets like promoting Th1, NK cell, \u03b3\u03b4 T cell responses, inhibiting Treg functionality, induction of IL-12, use of drugs including phytochemicals have been designed to counter tumor progression with much success. Some natural agents and phytochemicals merit further study. For example, use of certain key polysaccharide components from mushrooms and plants have shown to possess therapeutic impact on tumor-imposed genetic instability, anti-growth signaling, replicative immortality, dysregulated metabolism etc. In this review, we will discuss the advances made toward understanding the basis of cancer immune evasion and summarize the efficacy of various therapeutic measures and targets that have been developed or are being investigated to enhance tumor rejection.",

     "abstract": "Deregulation of angiogenesis \u2013 the growth of new blood vessels from an existing vasculature \u2013 is a main driving force in many severe human diseases including cancer. As such, tumor angiogenesis is important for delivering oxygen and nutrients to growing tumors, and therefore considered an essential pathologic feature of cancer, while also playing a key role in enabling other aspects of tumor pathology such as metabolic deregulation and tumor dissemination/metastasis. Recently, inhibition of tumor angiogenesis has become a clinical anti-cancer strategy in line with chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, which underscore the critical importance of the angiogenic switch during early tumor development. Unfortunately the clinically approved anti-angiogenic drugs in use today are only effective in a subset of the patients, and many who initially respond develop resistance over time. Also, some of the anti-angiogenic drugs are toxic and it would be of great importance to identify alternative compounds, which could overcome these drawbacks and limitations of the currently available therapy. Finding \u201cthe most important target\u201d may, however, prove a very challenging approach as the tumor environment is highly diverse, consisting of many different cell types, all of which may contribute to tumor angiogenesis. Furthermore, the tumor cells themselves are genetically unstable, leading to a progressive increase in the number of different angiogenic factors produced as the cancer progresses to advanced stages. As an alternative approach to targeted therapy, options to broadly interfere with angiogenic signals by a mixture of non-toxic natural compound with pleiotropic actions were viewed by this team as an opportunity to develop a complementary anti-angiogenesis treatment option. As a part of the \u201cHalifax Project\u201d within the \u201cGetting to know cancer\u201d framework, we have here, based on a thorough review of the literature, identified 10 important aspects of tumor angiogenesis and the pathological tumor vasculature which would be well suited as targets for anti-angiogenic therapy: (1) endothelial cell migration/tip cell formation, (2) structural abnormalities of tumor vessels, (3) hypoxia, (4) lymphangiogenesis, (5) elevated interstitial fluid pressure, (6) poor perfusion, (7) disrupted circadian rhythms, (8) tumor promoting inflammation, (9) tumor promoting fibroblasts and (10) tumor cell metabolism/acidosis. Following this analysis, we scrutinized the available literature on broadly acting anti-angiogenic natural products, with a focus on finding qualitative information on phytochemicals which could inhibit these targets and came up with 10 prototypical phytochemical compounds: (1) oleanolic acid, (2) tripterine, (3) silibinin, (4) curcumin, (5) epigallocatechin-gallate, (6) kaempferol, (7) melatonin, (8) enterolactone, (9) withaferin A and (10) resveratrol. We suggest that these plant-derived compounds could be combined to constitute a broader acting and more effective inhibitory cocktail at doses that would not be likely to cause excessive toxicity. All the targets and phytochemical approaches were further cross-validated against their effects on other essential tumorigenic pathways (based on the \u201challmarks\u201d of cancer) in order to discover possible synergies or potentially harmful interactions, and were found to generally also have positive involvement in/effects on these other aspects of tumor biology. The aim is that this discussion could lead to the selection of combinations of such anti-angiogenic compounds which could be used in potent anti-tumor cocktails, for enhanced therapeutic efficacy, reduced toxicity and circumvention of single-agent anti-angiogenic resistance, as well as for possible use in primary or secondary cancer prevention strategies.",

Many targeted therapies are highly toxic, costs are extremely high, and most patients experience relapse after a few disease-free months. Relapses arise from genetic heterogeneity in tumors, which harbor therapy-resistant immortalized cells that have adopted alternate and compensatory pathways (i.e., pathways that are not reliant upon the same mechanisms as those which have been targeted). To address these limitations, an international task force of 180 scientists was assembled to explore the concept of a low-toxicity \u201cbroad-spectrum\u201d therapeutic approach that could simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms. Using cancer hallmark phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment to account for the various aspects of relevant cancer biology, interdisciplinary teams reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a wide range of high-priority targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient outcomes. For these targets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic approaches were then suggested, many of which were phytochemicals. Proposed actions on each target and all of the approaches were further reviewed for known effects on other hallmark areas and the tumor microenvironment. Potential contrary or procarcinogenic effects were found for 3.9% of the relationships between targets and hallmarks, and mixed evidence of complementary and contrary relationships was found for 7.1%. Approximately 67% of the relationships revealed potentially complementary effects, and the remainder had no known relationship. Among the approaches, 1.1% had contrary, 2.8% had mixed and 62.1% had complementary relationships. These results suggest that a broad-spectrum approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint. This novel approach has potential to be relatively inexpensive, it should help us address stages and types of cancer that lack conventional treatment, and it may reduce relapse risks. A proposed agenda for future research is offered.",

Various transcription factor dysregulation in these neoplastic cells that explains for the loss of B-cell phenotype as well as acquisition of survival and anti-apoptotic features of HRS cells has been identified. Aberrant activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways play a central role in HL pathogenesis. Both intrinsic genetic mechanisms as well as extrinsic signals have been identified to account for the constitutive activation of these pathways.The extrinsic factors that regulate the activation of transcription pathways in HRS cells have also been studied in detail. Cytokines and chemokines produced both by the HRS cells as well as cells of the microenvironment of HL work in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner to promote survival of HRS cells as well as providing mechanisms for immune escape from the body's antitumor immunity.

Besides TP53 aberrations, several of these newly mutated genes have consistently been linked to shorter time to progression/treatment and poor overall survival (e.g. NOTCH1, SF3B1, BIRC3). These findings coupled with the diverse (sub)clonal evolution trajectory followed by CLL cells, at least in treated patients, alludes to their role as major subclonal driver events for disease progression. Together with the dependence of CLL cells on B-cell receptor (BcR) signaling and antigen stimulation, this reveals a disease within which both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors conspire to fuel leukemogenesis, and we have only recently begun to understand their intricate interplay.

The diverse tissues involved and the highly variable clinicopathologic features are related to an interaction between the neoplastic lymphoid cells and the tissues that they infiltrate. When different subpopulations of T-cells undergo transformation, they retain some of their inherent characteristics, including tissue tropisms, gene expression profiles and cytokine secretion patterns; which collaborate to impact on the cellular composition and structure of the lymphoma. Non-neoplastic cellular components of the lymphoma, including normal T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils are altered by the neoplastic lymphoid cells, leading to changes in patterns of gene and protein expressions. These changes in turn modify the microenvironment of the lymphoma, inducing blood vessel formation and providing survival and proliferative signals to the neoplastic lymphoid cells. Tumor-infiltrating macrophages undergo M2 polarization as a result of the cytokines produced by the neoplastic T-cells. These macrophages in turn promote angiogenesis and inhibit anti-tumor cellular immunity. The macrophage content has been shown to correlate with treatment outcome in clinical studies. The effects of normal lymphocytes on T-cell lymphoma biology are more conflicting, with both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the neoplastic cells demonstrated in vitro. Endothelial cells from micro-vessels interact with neoplastic T-cells mainly through the production of vascular endothelial growth factor. The prognostic and therapeutic significance of microvasculature have also been demonstrated in some clinical trials. This complex network of cellular, immunological and molecular interactions underlies the pathologies, clinical manifestations and treatment outcome of T-cell lymphomas. The understanding of the impact of the microenvironment on neoplastic T-cells should be further exploited in translational research to generate biomarkers that may be applicable to disease classification, treatment and prognostication.",

Initially, single viral infection was considered fully responsible for the oncogenic properties of each virus, while it is now established that in many cases, multiple viral agents collaborate as cofactors in inducing lymphomas, especially in the presence of HIV-dependent immunodeficiency. Viruses cooperate by using their specific pathogenetic mechanisms in different combinations. The aim of this review is to describe the cooperation between different viruses in the development of lymphomas including the evidences supporting their pathogenetic role. Viral cooperation, a mechanism by which different viruses coinfecting human tissues have synergistic or regulatory effects on carcinogenesis, targets neoplastic B cells as well as cells of the microenvironment, such as reactive T-cells, B cells and macrophages, as well as non-immune cells such as endothelial cells, that contribute to tumor microenvironment.

Lymphomagenesis related to viral cooperation represents an interesting topic where microenvironmental abnormalities may be particularly relevant, particularly because antiviral targeted therapies and therapies producing the reconstitution of the immune system may constitute areas of interest aiming at improving the outcome of virus associated lymphomas. While the immune component of the lymphoma microenvironment can be easily studied by immunological and molecular techniques, the definition of the non-immune component of the lymphoma microenvironment is largely incomplete and may be the issue of future investigations.

Microenvironmental functions are essential to lymphoma; they provide survival and proliferation signals and license immune evasion. It is plausible that interventions that aim to destroy tumor\u2013microenvironment interactions may improve responses to therapeutics. Accordingly, the identification of extrinsic factors and their downstream intracellular signaling targets has led to much progress in understanding tumor\u2013microenvironment interactions. Lymphoma cells are differently influenced by cells\u2019 interactions with components of their microenvironment; these cell extrinsic factors include soluble and immobilized factors, the extracellular matrix, and signals presented by neighboring cells. Soluble factors, which are often cell-secreted autocrine and paracrine factors, comprise a significant fraction of targetable molecules. To begin to understand how intercellular communication is conducted in lymphoma, a first order of study is deciphering the soluble factors secreted by malignant cells and microenvironmental cells. These soluble factors are shed into the interstitial fluid in lymphoma and can be conveniently explored using mass spectrometry. Protein components can be detected and quantified, thus enabling the routine navigation of the soluble part of the microenvironment. Elucidating functional and signaling states affords a new paradigm for understanding cancer biology and devising new therapies. This review summarizes knowledge in this field and discusses the utility of studying tumor-secreted factors.",

Adaptation to stress and re-establishment of ER homeostasis is achieved by activation of an integrated signal transduction pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR).

Although at early stages or physiological conditions of ER stress, the UPR generally promotes survival, when the stress becomes more stringent or prolonged, its role can switch to a pro-cell death one. Here, we discuss historical and recent evidence supporting an involvement of the UPR in malignancy, describe the main mechanisms by which tumor cells overcome ER stress to promote their survival, tumor progression and metastasis and discuss the current state of efforts to develop therapeutic approaches of targeting the UPR.",

These enzymes can often provide strict conformational protein folding solutions to highly cysteine-rich cargo as they facilitate disulphide rearrangement in the endoplasmic reticulum. Under conditions when PDI substrates are not isomerised properly, secreted proteins can accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress initiation with implications for human disease development. Anterior Gradient-2 (AGR2) is an endoplasmic reticulum-resident PDI superfamily member that has emerged as a dominant effector of basic biological properties in vertebrates including blastoderm formation and limb regeneration. AGR2 perturbation in mammals influences disease processes including cancer progression and drug resistance, asthma, and inflammatory bowel disease. This review will focus on the molecular characteristics, function, and regulation of AGR2, views on its emerging biological functions and misappropriation in disease, and prospects for therapeutic intervention into endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein folding pathways for improving the treatment of human disease.",

     "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and the unfolded protein response (UPR) are emerging as key adaptation mechanisms in response to loss of proteostasis, with major cell autonomous and non-autonomous functions impacting cancer progression and therapeutic responses. In recent years, vital physiological roles of the ER in maintenance of proteostasis, Ca2+ signaling and trafficking through the secretory pathway have emerged. Some of these functions have been shown to be decisive for mobilizing certain signals from injured/dying cancer cells in response to certain anticancer treatments, toward the plasma membrane and ultimately emit them into the extracellular environment, where they may act as danger signals. The spatiotemporally defined emission of these signals, better known as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), distinguishes this type of cancer cell death from physiological apoptosis, which is tolerogenic in nature, thereby enabling these dying cancer cells to alert the immune system and \u201cre-activate\u201d antitumor immunity. The emission of DAMPs, decisive for immunogenic cell death (ICD) and which include the ER chaperone calreticulin and ATP, is reliant on a danger signaling module induced by certain assorted anticancer treatments through oxidative-ER stress. The main focus of this review is to discuss the emerging role of ER-stress regulated pathways and processes in danger signaling thereby regulating the cancer cell-immune cell interface by the extracellular emission of DAMPs. In particular, we discuss signaling contexts existing upstream and around PERK, a major ER-stress sensor in ICD context, which have not been emphatically discussed in the context of antitumor immunity and ICD up until now.

Such a functionally peculiar variant of apoptosis has been dubbed immunogenic cell death (ICD). One of the central events in the course of ICD is the activation of an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. This is instrumental for cells undergoing ICD to emit all the signals that are required for their demise to be perceived as immunogenic by the host, and culminates with the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1). In particular, eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation is required for the pre-apoptotic exposure of the ER chaperone calreticulin (CALR) on the cell surface, which is a central determinant of ICD. Importantly, phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 can be quantified in both preclinical and clinical samples by immunoblotting or immunohistochemistry using phosphoneoepitope-specific monoclonal antibodies. Of note, the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and CALR exposure do not necessarily correlate with each other, and neither of these parameters is sufficient for cell death to be perceived as immunogenic. Nonetheless, accumulating data indicate that assessing the degree of phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 provides a convenient parameter to monitor ICD. Here, we discuss the role of the ER stress response in ICD and the potential value of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation as a biomarker for this clinically relevant variant of apoptosis.",

They dictate commitment to a specific lineage but prevent mature differentiation, thus locking the cells in a state of proliferative precursors. Deregulated expression of lineage-specific transcription factors and controllers of chromatin structure play a central role in MSC reprogramming and sarcoma pathogenesis.

     "abstract": "Early primitive stem cells have long been viewed as the cancer cells of origin (tumor initiating target cells) due to their intrinsic features of self-renewal and longevity. However, emerging evidence suggests a surprising capacity for normal committed cells to function as reserve stem cells upon reprogramming as a consequence of tissue damage resulting in inflammation and wound healing. This results in an alternative concept positing that tumors may originate from differentiated cells that can re-acquire stem cell properties due to genetic or epigenetic reprogramming. It is likely that both models are correct, and that a continuum of potential cells of origin exists, ranging from early primitive stem cells to committed progenitor or even terminally differentiated cells. A combination of the nature of the target cell and the specific types of gene mutations introduced determine tumor cell lineage, as well as potential for malignant conversion. Evidence from mouse skin models of carcinogenesis suggests that initiated cells at different stages within a stem cell hierarchy have varying degrees of requirement for reprogramming (e.g. inflammation stimuli), depending on their degree of differentiation. This article will present evidence in favor of these concepts that has been developed from studies of several mouse models of skin carcinogenesis.",

These reports provide evidence supporting the idea that non-stem cancer cells exhibit a remarkable degree of plasticity that allows them to re-acquire cancer stem cell traits, especially in the context of radiation therapy. We summarize conditions under which differentiation is reversed and discuss the current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms.",

BCICs have been identified in clinical specimens based on CD44+/CD24\u2212/low membrane expression and/or enzymatic activity of aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1+), or isolated and in vitro propagated as non-adherent spheres. This cell population has been demonstrated to be able to recreate, when injected in mice even at very low concentrations, the same histopathological features of the tumor they were derived from and to escape from current therapeutic strategies. Alterations in genes involved in stemness-related pathways, such as Wnt, Notch, and Sonic Hedgehog, have been proven to play a role in breast cancer progression. Targeting these key elements represents an attractive option, with a solid rationale, although possible concerns may derive from the poor knowledge of tolerance and efficacy of inhibiting these mechanisms without inducing severe side effects. In addition, efforts to develop alternative BCIC-targeted therapies against stemness markers (CD44 and ALDH1) and molecules involved in regulating EMT- and HER2-related pathways, or able to reverse the multi-drug resistance phenotype, or to induce differentiation and to control cell survival pathways are currently ongoing and encouraging results from pre-clinical studies have already been obtained using in vitro and in vivo models.",

     "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment includes a complicated network of physiological gradients contributing to plasticity of tumor cells and heterogeneity of tumor tissue. Hypoxia is a key component generating intratumoral oxygen gradients, which affect the cellular expression program and lead to therapy resistance and increased metastatic propensity of weakly oxygenated cell subpopulations. One of the adaptive responses of tumor cells to hypoxia involves the increased expression and functional activation of carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a cancer-related cell surface enzyme catalyzing the reversible conversion of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate ion and proton. Via its catalytic activity, CA IX participates in regulation of intracellular and extracellular pH perturbations that result from hypoxia-induced changes in cellular metabolism producing excess of acid. Through the ability to regulate pH, CA IX also facilitates cell migration and invasion. In addition, CA IX has non-catalytic function in cell adhesion and spreading. Thus, CA IX endows tumor cells with survival advantages in hypoxia/acidosis and confers an increased ability to migrate, invade and metastasize. Accordingly, CA IX is expressed in a broad range of tumors, where it is associated with prognosis and therapy outcome. Its expression pattern and functional implications in tumor biology make CA IX a promising therapeutic target, which can be hit either by immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies or with compounds inhibiting its enzyme activity. The first strategy has already reached the clinical trials, whereas the second one is still in preclinical testing. Both strategies indicate that CA IX can become a clinically useful anticancer target, but urge further efforts toward better selection of patients for immunotherapy and deeper understanding of tumor types, clinical situations and synthetic lethality interactions with other treatment approaches.",

Consequently, intrinsic and acquired therapy resistance arises and presents one of the major goals to solve in oncologic research today. Among the myriad of microenvironmental factors impacting on cancer cell resistance, cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) has recently been identified as key determinant. Despite the differentiation between cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAMDR) and cell adhesion-mediated radioresistance (CAMRR), the underlying mechanisms share great overlap in integrin and focal adhesion hub signaling and differ further downstream in the complexity of signaling networks between tumor entities. Intriguingly, cell adhesion to ECM is per se also essential for cancer cells similar to their normal counterparts. However, based on the overexpression of focal adhesion hub signaling receptors and proteins and a distinct addiction to particular integrin receptors, targeting of focal adhesion proteins has been shown to potently sensitize cancer cells to different treatment regimes including radiotherapy, chemotherapy and novel molecular therapeutics. In this review, we will give insight into the role of integrins in carcinogenesis, tumor progression and metastasis. Additionally, literature and data about the function of focal adhesion molecules including integrins, integrin-associated proteins and growth factor receptors in tumor cell resistance to radio- and chemotherapy will be elucidated and discussed.",

Its role in signal transduction was first implied through the interaction with integrin receptors, either by binding with the RGD motif or by proteolytic cleavage of the C-terminal amino acids of the cytosolic part of the integrin beta chain. Several other molecules, involved in cellular signaling, have since been shown to be targets for cathepsin X, such as \u03b3-enolase, chemokine CXCL-12, bradykinin, kallidin, huntingtin and profilin 1. In cancer, cathepsin X regulates adhesion of tumor and endothelial cells and their migration and invasion through the extracellular matrix. It also promotes tumor progression by bypassing cellular senescence and by inducing an epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. The high RNA and protein levels of cathepsin X, found in tumor samples and bodily fluids of patients with various cancer types, further support its active role in tumor progression.

These findings have nourished the theory that autophagy provides cancer cells with a survival advantage during stressful conditions, including exposure to therapeutics. Therefore, interference with the autophagic response can potentially enhance the efficacy of cancer therapy.In this review we examine two approaches to modulate autophagy as complementary cancer treatment: inhibition and induction. Inhibition of autophagy during cancer treatment eliminates its cytoprotective effects. Conversely, induction of autophagy combined with conventional cancer therapy exerts severe cytoplasmic degradation that can ultimately lead to cell death.

     "abstract": "Tumor genome sequencing leads to documenting thousands of DNA mutations and other genomic alterations. At present, these data cannot be analyzed adequately to aid in the understanding of tumorigenesis and its evolution. Moreover, we have little insight into how to use these data to predict clinical phenotypes and tumor progression to better design patient treatment. To meet these challenges, we discuss a cancer hallmark network framework for modeling genome sequencing data to predict cancer clonal evolution and associated clinical phenotypes. The framework includes: (1) cancer hallmarks that can be represented by a few molecular/signaling networks. \u2018Network operational signatures\u2019 which represent gene regulatory logics/strengths enable to quantify state transitions and measures of hallmark traits. Thus, sets of genomic alterations which are associated with network operational signatures could be linked to the state/measure of hallmark traits. The network operational signature transforms genotypic data (i.e., genomic alterations) to regulatory phenotypic profiles (i.e., regulatory logics/strengths), to cellular phenotypic profiles (i.e., hallmark traits) which lead to clinical phenotypic profiles (i.e., a collection of hallmark traits). Furthermore, the framework considers regulatory logics of the hallmark networks under tumor evolutionary dynamics and therefore also includes: (2) a self-promoting positive feedback loop that is dominated by a genomic instability network and a cell survival/proliferation network is the main driver of tumor clonal evolution. Surrounding tumor stroma and its host immune systems shape the evolutionary paths; (3) cell motility initiating metastasis is a byproduct of the above self-promoting loop activity during tumorigenesis; (4) an emerging hallmark network which triggers genome duplication dominates a feed-forward loop which in turn could act as a rate-limiting step for tumor formation; (5) mutations and other genomic alterations have specific patterns and tissue-specificity, which are driven by aging and other cancer-inducing agents.This framework represents the logics of complex cancer biology as a myriad of phenotypic complexities governed by a limited set of underlying organizing principles. It therefore adds to our understanding of tumor evolution and tumorigenesis, and moreover, potential usefulness of predicting tumors\u2019 evolutionary paths and clinical phenotypes. Strategies of using this framework in conjunction with genome sequencing data in an attempt to predict personalized drug targets, drug resistance, and metastasis for cancer patients, as well as cancer risks for healthy individuals are discussed. Accurate prediction of cancer clonal evolution and clinical phenotypes will have substantial impact on timely diagnosis, personalized treatment and personalized prevention of cancer.",

     "abstract": "The multiscale complexity of cancer as a disease necessitates a corresponding multiscale modelling approach to produce truly predictive mathematical models capable of improving existing treatment protocols. To capture all the dynamics of solid tumour growth and its progression, mathematical modellers need to couple biological processes occurring at various spatial and temporal scales (from genes to tissues). Because effectiveness of cancer therapy is considerably affected by intracellular and extracellular heterogeneities as well as by the dynamical changes in the tissue microenvironment, any model attempt to optimise existing protocols must consider these factors ultimately leading to improved multimodal treatment regimes. By improving existing and building new mathematical models of cancer, modellers can play important role in preventing the use of potentially sub-optimal treatment combinations. In this paper, we analyse a multiscale computational mathematical model for cancer growth and spread, incorporating the multiple effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy in the patient survival probability and implement the model using two different cell based modelling techniques. We show that the insights provided by such multiscale modelling approaches can ultimately help in designing optimal patient-specific multi-modality treatment protocols that may increase patients quality of life.",

The development of experimental and analytical tools which generate high-throughput biological data including lots of information could lead to application of computational models in biological discovery and clinical medicine especially for cancer. Due to the recent availability of tissue-specific reconstructed models, new opportunities in studying metabolic alteration in various kinds of cancers open up. Structural approaches at genome-scale levels seem to be suitable for developing diagnostic and prognostic molecular signatures, as well as in identifying new drug targets.

Our central premise is that cancer is an evolving system subject to mutation and selection, and the primary conduit for these processes to occur is the cancer cell whose behaviour is regulated on multiple biological scales. The selection pressure is mainly driven by the microenvironment that the tumour is growing in and this acts directly upon the cell phenotype. In turn, the phenotype is driven by the intracellular pathways that are regulated by the genotype. Integrating all of these processes is a massive undertaking and requires bridging many biological scales (i.e. genotype, pathway, phenotype and environment) that we will only scratch the surface of in this review. We will focus on models that use neural networks as a means of connecting these different biological scales, since they allow us to easily create heterogeneity for selection to act upon and importantly this heterogeneity can be implemented at different biological scales. More specifically, we consider three different neural networks that bridge different aspects of these scales and the dialogue with the micro-environment, (i) the impact of the micro-environment on evolutionary dynamics, (ii) the mapping from genotype to phenotype under drug-induced perturbations and (iii) pathway activity in both normal and cancer cells under different micro-environmental conditions.",

     "abstract": "Cancer is increasingly perceived as a systems-level, network phenomenon. The major trend of malignant transformation can be described as a two-phase process, where an initial increase of network plasticity is followed by a decrease of plasticity at late stages of tumor development. The fluctuating intensity of stress factors, like hypoxia, inflammation and the either cooperative or hostile interactions of tumor inter-cellular networks, all increase the adaptation potential of cancer cells. This may lead to the bypass of cellular senescence, and to the development of cancer stem cells. We propose that the central tenet of cancer stem cell definition lies exactly in the indefinability of cancer stem cells. Actual properties of cancer stem cells depend on the individual \u201cstress-history\u201d of the given tumor. Cancer stem cells are characterized by an extremely large evolvability (i.e. a capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation), which corresponds well with the defining hallmarks of cancer stem cells: the possession of the capacity to self-renew and to repeatedly re-build the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells that comprise a tumor in new environments. Cancer stem cells represent a cell population, which is adapted to adapt. We argue that the high evolvability of cancer stem cells is helped by their repeated transitions between plastic (proliferative, symmetrically dividing) and rigid (quiescent, asymmetrically dividing, often more invasive) phenotypes having plastic and rigid networks. Thus, cancer stem cells reverse and replay cancer development multiple times. We describe network models potentially explaining cancer stem cell-like behavior.

     "abstract": "Given the multi-factorial nature of cancer, uncovering its metabolic alterations and evaluating their implications is a major challenge in biomedical sciences that will help in the optimal design of personalized treatments. The advance of high-throughput technologies opens an invaluable opportunity to monitor the activity at diverse biological levels and elucidate how cancer originates, evolves and responds under drug treatments. To this end, researchers are confronted with two fundamental questions: how to interpret high-throughput data and how this information can contribute to the development of personalized treatment in patients. A variety of schemes in systems biology have been suggested to characterize the phenotypic states associated with cancer by utilizing computational modeling and high-throughput data. These theoretical schemes are distinguished by the level of complexity of the biological mechanisms that they represent and by the computational approaches used to simulate them. Notably, these theoretical approaches have provided a proper framework to explore some distinctive metabolic mechanisms observed in cancer cells such as the Warburg effect. In this review, we focus on presenting a general view of some of these approaches whose application and integration will be crucial in the transition from local to global conclusions in cancer studies. We are convinced that multidisciplinary approaches are required to construct the bases of an integrative and personalized medicine, which has been and remains a fundamental task in the medicine of this century.",

The IGF2 mRNA binding protein family (IGF2BPs) comprises three RBPs. Two members of the family, IGF2BP1 and IGF2BP3, are bona fide oncofetal proteins, which are de novo synthesized in various human cancers. In vitro studies revealed that IGF2BPs serve as post-transcriptional fine-tuners modulating the expression of genes implicated in the control of tumor cell proliferation, survival, chemo-resistance and metastasis. Consistently, the expression of both IGF2BP family members was reported to correlate with an overall poor prognosis and metastasis in various human cancers. Due to the fact that most reports used a pan-IGF2BP antibody for studying IGF2BP expression in cancer, paralogue-specific functions can barely be evaluated at present. Nonetheless, the accordance of IGF2BPs\u2019 role in promoting an aggressive phenotype of tumor-derived cells in vitro and their upregulated expression in aggressive malignancies provides strong evidence that IGF2BPs are powerful post-transcriptional oncogenes enhancing tumor growth, drug-resistance and metastasis.

     "abstract": "Oncofoetal antigens are present during foetal development with generally limited expression in the adult but are upregulated in cancer. These molecules can sometimes be used to diagnose or follow treatment of tumours or as a target for different immunotherapies. The 5T4 oncofoetal glycoprotein was identified by searching for shared surface molecules of human trophoblast and cancer cells with the rationale that they may function to allow survival of the foetus as a semi-allograft in the mother or a tumour in its host, potentially influencing growth, invasion or altered immune surveillance of the host. 5T4 tumour selective expression has stimulated the development of 5T4 vaccine, 5T4 antibody targeted-superantigen and 5T4 antibody-drug therapies through preclinical and into clinical studies. It is now apparent that 5T4 expression is a marker of the use (or not) of several cellular pathways relevant to tumour growth and spread. Thus 5T4 expression is mechanistically associated with the directional movement of cells through epithelial mesenchymal transition, facilitation of CXCL12/CXCR4 chemotaxis, blocking of canonical Wnt/beta-catenin while favouring non-canonical pathway signalling. These processes are highly regulated in development and in normal adult tissues but can contribute to the spread of cancer cells. Understanding the differential impact of these pathways marked by 5T4 can potentially improve existing, or aid development of novel cancer treatment strategies.",

     "abstract": "The Ras-ERK pathway is deregulated in approximately a third of human cancers, particularly those of epithelial origin. In aggressive, triple-negative, basal-like breast cancers, most tumors display increased MEK and ERK phosphorylation and exhibit a gene expression profile characteristic of Kras or EGFR mutant tumors; however, Ras family genetic mutations are uncommon in triple-negative breast cancer and EGFR mutations account for only a subset of these tumors. Therefore, the upstream events that activate MAPK signaling and promote tumor aggression in triple-negative breast cancers remain poorly defined. We have previously shown that a secreted TGF-\u03b2 family signaling ligand, Nodal, is expressed in breast cancer in correlation with disease progression. Here we highlight key findings demonstrating that Nodal is required in aggressive human breast cancer cells to activate ERK signaling and downstream tumorigenic phenotypes both in vitro and in vivo. Experimental knockdown of Nodal signaling downregulates ERK activity, resulting in loss of c-myc, upregulation of p27, G1 cell cycle arrest, increased apoptosis and decreased tumorigenicity. The data suggest that ERK activation by Nodal signaling regulates c-myc and p27 proteins post-translationally and that this cascade is essential for aggressive breast tumor behavior in vivo. As the MAPK pathway is an important target for treating triple-negative breast cancers, upstream Nodal signaling may represent a promising target for breast cancer diagnosis and combined therapies aimed at blocking ERK pathway activation.",

The cell membrane cis form is found in lipid rafts and endosomes while the trans acting form lacking the GPI anchor is soluble. As a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)/Cripto-1-FRL-1-Cryptic (CFC) family, CR-1 functions as an obligatory co-receptor for the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) family members, Nodal and growth and differentiation factors 1 and 3 (GDF1/3) by activating Alk4/Alk7 signaling pathways that involve Smads 2, 3 and 4. In addition, CR-1 can activate non-Smad-dependent signaling elements such as PI3K, Akt and MAPK. Both of these pathways depend upon the 78\u00a0kDa glucose regulated protein (GRP78). Finally, CR-1 can facilitate signaling through the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and Notch/Cbf-1 pathways by functioning as a chaperone protein for LRP5/6 and Notch, respectively. CR-1 is essential for early embryonic development and maintains embryonic stem cell pluripotentiality. CR-1 performs an essential role in the etiology and progression of several types of human tumors where it is expressed in a population of cancer stem cells (CSCs) and facilitates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). In this context, CR-1 can significantly enhance tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Collectively, these facts suggest that CR-1 may be an attractive target in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of several types of human cancer.",

     "abstract": "Germ cell tumors (GCTs) represent a diverse group of tumors presumably originating from (early fetal) developing germ cells. Most frequent are the testicular germ cell cancers (TGCC). Overall, TGCC is the most frequent malignancy in Caucasian males (20\u201340 years) and remains an important cause of (treatment related) mortality in these young men. The strong association between the phenotype of TGCC stem cell components and their totipotent ancestor (fetal primordial germ cell or gonocyte) makes these tumors highly relevant from an onco-fetal point of view. This review subsequently discusses the evidence for the early embryonic origin of TGCCs, followed by an overview of the crucial association between TGCC pathogenesis, genetics, environmental exposure and the (fetal) testicular micro-environment (genvironment). This culminates in an evaluation of three genvironmentally modulated hallmarks of TGCC directly related to the oncofetal pathogenesis of TGCC: (1) maintenance of pluripotency, (2) cell cycle control/cisplatin sensitivity and (3) regulation of proliferation/migration/apoptosis by KIT-KITL mediated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Briefly, TGCC exhibit identifiable stem cell components (seminoma and embryonal carcinoma) and progenitors that show large and consistent similarities to primordial/embryonic germ cells, their presumed totipotent cells of origin. TGCC pathogenesis depends crucially on a complex interaction of genetic and (micro-)environmental, i.e. genvironmental risk factors that have only been partly elucidated despite significant effort. TGCC stem cell components also show a high degree of similarity with embryonic stem/germ cells (ES) in the regulation of pluripotency and cell cycle control, directly related to their exquisite sensitivity to DNA damaging agents (e.g. cisplatin). Of note, (ES specific) micro-RNAs play a pivotal role in the crossover between cell cycle control, pluripotency and chemosensitivity. Moreover, multiple consistent observations reported TGCC to be associated with KIT-KITL mediated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, a pathway crucially implicated in proliferation, migration and survival during embryogenesis including germ cell development. In conclusion, TGCCs are a fascinating model for onco-fetal developmental processes especially with regard to studying cell cycle control, pluripotency maintenance and KIT-KITL signaling. The knowledge presented here contributes to better understanding of the molecular characteristics of TGCC pathogenesis, translating to identification of at risk individuals and enhanced quality of care for TGCC patients (diagnosis, treatment and follow-up).",

The combined literature suggests that for teratomas derived from human diploid bona fide PSC the embryonic development in the separate tissue-niches can show a controlled differentiation into organoid patterns closely mimicking early development.In the experimental situation such PSCT human homologous in vivo tissue-niches have been shown to provide also matching microenvironment for a micrometastatic colonization and outgrowth of embryonic tumors transplanted directly from patients.

     "abstract": "Human cancers constitutively produce and release endosome-derived nanometer-sized vesicles called exosomes that carry biologically active proteins, messenger and micro RNAs and serve as vehicles of intercellular communication. The tumour exosomes are present in the blood, urine and various malignant effusions such as peritoneal and pleural fluid of cancer patients and can modulate immune cells and responses thus deranging the immune system of cancer patients and giving advantage to the cancer to establish and spread itself. Here, the role of exosomes in the NKG2D receptor\u2013ligand system's interactions is discussed. The activating NK cell receptor NKG2D and its multiple ligands, the MHC class I-related chain (MIC) A/B and the retinoic acid transcript-1/UL-16 binding proteins (RAET1/ULBP) 1\u20136 comprise a powerful stress-inducible danger detector system that targets infected, inflamed and malignantly transformed cells and plays a decisive role in anti-tumour immune surveillance. Mounting evidence reveals that the MIC- and RAET1/ULBP ligand family members are enriched in the endosomal compartment of various tumour cells and expressed and released into the intercellular space and bodily fluids on exosomes thus preserving their entire molecule, three-dimensional protein structure and biologic activity. The NKG2D ligand-expressing exosomes serve as decoys with a powerful ability to down regulate the cognate receptor and impair the cytotoxic function of NK-, NKT-, gamma/delta- and cytotoxic T cells.

     "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs), e.g. exosomes and microvesicles, emerge as new signaling organelles in the exchange of information between cells at the paracrine and systemic level. It is clear that these virus like particles carry complex biological information that can elicit a pleiotropic response in recipient cells with potential relevance in physiology as well as in cancer and other pathological conditions. Numerous studies convincingly show that the molecular composition of EVs closely reflects their cell or tissue of origin. Thus, the signaling status of donor cells, more specifically their endosomal compartments, may largely determine the biological output in recipient cells, a process that we then may conceptualize as vesicle mediated phene transfer. Whereas more conventional modes of cell\u2013cell communication mostly depend on extracellular ligand concentration and cell-surface receptor availability, the magnitude of the EV signaling response relies on the capture and uptake by target cells, allowing release of the EV content. Numerous reports point at the intriguing possibility that, among thousands of mRNAs, miRNAs, and proteins, single EV constituents effectuate the biological response, e.g. stimulation of angiogenesis and cancer cell metastasis, in recipient cells; however, we find it conceivable that strategies targeted at general mechanisms of EV function should provide more rational avenues for therapeutic intervention directed at the EV system. Such strategies include manipulation of EV formation in the endolysosomal system, EV stability in the extracellular milieu, and EV entry into target cells. Here, we provide important insights into potential mechanisms of EV transport in mammalian cells and how these may be targeted.",

Exosomes are suggested to be the most potent intercellular communicators. Being recovered in all body fluids, they can communicate with neighboring as well as distant cells. The latter was first described for dendritic cell exosomes that can initiate T cell activation. However, tumor exosomes (TEX) may impede this crosstalk. Besides with hematopoietic cells, TEX communicate with the tumor cell itself, but also with host stroma cells and endothelial cells. This crosstalk received much attention as there is strong evidence that TEX account for angiogenesis and premetastatic niche formation, which may proceed directly via binding and uptake of TEX by cells in the premetastatic organ or indirectly via TEX being taken up by hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow (BM), which mature toward lineages with immunosuppressive features or are forced toward premature release from the BM and homing into premetastatic organs. Knowing these deleterious activities of TEX, it becomes demanding to search for modes of therapeutic interference.

     "abstract": "In recent years exosomes have emerged as potent stimulators of immune responses and as agents for cancer therapy. Exosomes can carry a broad variety of immunostimulatory molecules depending on the cell of origin and in vitro culture conditions. Dendritic cell-derived exosomes (dexosomes) have been shown to carry NK cell activating ligands and can be loaded with antigen to activate invariant NKT cells and to induce antigen-specific T and B cell responses. Dexosomes have been investigated as therapeutic agents against cancer in two phase I clinical trials, with a phase II clinical trial currently ongoing.

     "abstract": "Hematologic malignancies are often associated with chromosomal rearrangements that lead to the expression of chimeric fusion proteins. Rearrangements of the genes encoding two nucleoporins, NUP98 and NUP214, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several types of hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia. NUP98 rearrangements result in fusion of an N-terminal portion of NUP98 to one of numerous proteins. These rearrangements often follow treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors and tend to occur in younger patients. They have been shown to induce leukemia in mice and to enhance proliferation and disrupt differentiation in primary human hematopoietic precursors. NUP214 has only a few fusion partners. DEK-NUP214 is the most common NUP214 fusion in AML; it tends to occur in younger patients and is usually associated with FLT3 internal tandem duplications. The leukemogenic activity of NUP214 fusions is less well characterized. Normal nucleoporins, including NUP98 and NUP214, have important functions in nucleocytoplasmic transport, transcription, and mitosis. These functions and their disruptions by oncogenic nucleoporin fusions are discussed.",

Critical regulatory mechanisms include trafficking of proteins to specific subcellular compartments and post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as ubiquitylation or sumoylation. These mechanisms often operate in a co-ordinated manner to determine the levels, localization and activity of a protein. In particular, the functional relationships between active nucleocytoplasmic transport and the ubiquitin/SUMO modification pathways are becoming progressively elucidated. In this review, we focus on the interplay between these two processes, and its importance in cancer. We begin by presenting an overview of the processes of protein ubiquitylation and sumoylation, with an emphasis on the cross-regulation that exists between the nuclear transport machinery and the ubiquitin/SUMO modification enzymes. Next, we focus on the regulation of the important tumor proteins p53 and PTEN as examples to illustrate how these processes cooperate to modulate the activity of cancer-related proteins. Importantly, novel drugs are being developed that target proteins playing a role in nuclear transport (e.g. the nuclear export receptor CRM1) and ubiquitin/SUMO modifications (e.g. ubiquitin E3 ligases and deubiquitinases). A deeper understanding of the interplay between these processes may facilitate in the future the rational combination of these novel agents.",

In particular, specific gene mutations can alter nuclear transport of tumor suppressing and oncogenic proteins, leading to cell transformation or cancer progression. This review will focus on one such factor, \u03b2-catenin, a key mediator of the canonical wnt signaling pathway. In response to a wnt stimulus or specific gene mutations, \u03b2-catenin is stabilized and translocates to the nucleus where it binds TCF/LEF-1 transcription factors to transactivate genes that drive tumor formation. Moreover, the nuclear import and accumulation of \u03b2-catenin correlates with clinical tumor grade. Recent evidence suggests that the primary nuclear transport route of \u03b2-catenin is independent of the classical Ran/importin import machinery, and that \u03b2-catenin directly contacts the nuclear pore complex to self-regulate its own entry into the nucleus. Here we propose that the \u03b2-catenin nuclear import pathway may provide an opportunity for identification of specific drug targets and inhibition of \u03b2-catenin nuclear function, much like the current screening of drugs that block binding of \u03b2-catenin to LEF-1/TCFs.

It is a fine tuned process that when disturbed leads to pathological conditions especially cancers with aggressive and metastatic behavior. Snail is an oncogene that has been well established to be a promoter of EMT through direct repression of epithelial morphology promoter E-cadherin. It can function in the nucleus, in the cytosol and as discovered recently, extracellularly through secretory vesicular structures. The intracellular transport of snail has for long been shown to be regulated by the nuclear pore complex. One of the Karyopherins, importin alpha, mediates snail import, while exportin 1 (Xpo1) also known as chromosome maintenance region 1 (CRM1) is its major nuclear exporter. A number of additional biological regulators are emerging that directly modulate Snail stability by altering its subcellular localization. These observations indicate that targeting the nuclear transport machinery could be an important and as of yet, unexplored avenue for therapeutic intervention against the EMT processes in cancer. In parallel, a number of novel agents that disrupt nuclear transport have recently been discovered and are being explored for their anti-cancer effects in the early clinical settings. Through this review we provide insights on the mechanisms regulating snail subcellular localization and how this impacts EMT.

MicroRNAs target about 80% of the protein-coding mRNAs and therefore can be considered master regulators of multiple cellular pathways, contributing to the fine-tuning the cell's most important processes, like the ones involved in cellular growth and proliferation. Deregulation of miRNAs plays a fundamental role in the onset, progression and dissemination of many cancers; therefore impairment of miRNA biosynthesis is an important event in the tumorigenic cascade. MicroRNA synthesis is a multistep regulated process that requires transport of RNA molecules from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The immature miRNA species that are produced in the nucleus are exported through the nuclear pore complexes via mobile export receptors. Small RNAs such as precursors of miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) are transported out of the nucleus by a specific nuclear transport receptor, exportin-5 (XPO5). Pre-miRNA nuclear export is a fundamental step in miRNAs biosynthesis and its deregulation through inactivating mutations in the XPO5 gene can lead to pre-miRNA nuclear accumulation and disturbance of mature miRNA expression. In addition, it is becoming increasingly evident that mature miRNAs also function as gene regulators in the nuclear compartment. In this review, we will discuss the export of miRNA precursors and its impairment in human cancer as well as the recently described nuclear functions of miRNAs.",

Subcellular localization of exported proteins linked to cancer development include those involved in cell growth and proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, transformation, angiogenesis, cell adhesion, invasion, and metastasis. Here, we examined the basic mechanisms involved in the export of proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. All proteins over 40\u00a0kDa use the nuclear pore complex to gain entry or exit from the nucleus, with the primary nuclear export molecule involved in these processes being chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1, exportin 1 or XPO1). Proteins exported from the nucleus must possess a hydrophobic nuclear export signal (NES) peptide that binds to a hydrophobic groove containing an active-site Cys528 in the CRM1 protein. CRM1 inhibitors function largely by covalent modification of the active site Cys528 and prevent binding to the cargo protein NES. In the absence of a CRM1 inhibitor, CRM1 binds cooperatively to the NES of the cargo protein and RanGTP, forming a trimer that is actively transported out of the nucleus by facilitated diffusion. Nuclear export can be blocked by CRM1 inhibitors, NES peptide inhibitors or by preventing post-translational modification of cargo proteins. Clinical trials using the classic CRM1 inhibitor leptomycin B proved too toxic for patients; however, a new generation of less toxic small molecule inhibitors is being used in clinical trials in patients with both hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Additional trials are being initiated using small-molecule CRM1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapeutics such as pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. In this review, we present evidence that combining the new CRM1 inhibitors with other classes of therapeutics may prove effective in the treatment of cancer. Potential combinatorial therapies discussed include the use of CRM1 inhibitors and the addition of alkylating agents (melphalan), anthracyclines (doxorubicin and daunomycin), BRAF inhibitors, platinum drugs (cisplatin and oxaliplatin), proteosome inhibitors (bortezomib and carfilzomib), or tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (imatinib). Also, the sequence of treatment may be important for combination therapy. We found that the most effective treatment regimen involved first priming the cancer cells with the CRM1 inhibitor followed by doxorubicin, bortezomib, carfilzomib, or melphalan.

Up-regulation of XPO1 protein, a common occurrence in a variety of cancers, can lead to aberrant cytoplasmic localization and degradation of tumor suppressors such as p53 and FOXO.

Indeed, the role of HPV proteins, with regard to the DDR pathways, can be divided into two broad categories. The first set of viral proteins, HPV E1 and E2 activate a DNA damage response and recruit repair proteins to viral replication centers, where these proteins are likely usurped to replicate the viral genome. Because the activation of the DDR response typically elicits a cell cycle arrest that would impeded the viral lifecycle, the second set of HPV proteins, HPV E6 and E7, prevents the DDR response from pausing cell cycle progression or inducing apoptosis.

Understanding EBV's involvement in the pathogenesis of these different malignancies is an important long-term goal. This article focuses on two overlapping, but relatively neglected, areas of research that could contribute to that goal. The first addresses the mechanisms whereby coincident infections with other pathogens increase the risk of EBV-positive malignancies, and takes as its paradigm the actions of holoendemic malaria and HIV infections as co-factors in Burkitt lymphomagenesis. The second widens the argument to include both infectious and non-infectious sources of chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of EBV-positive tumours such as T/NK cell lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma.",

In addition to their impact on tumor epithelial cells, ROS also affect the surrounding cells that constitute the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, ROS production increases tumor angiogenesis, drives the onset of inflammation and promotes conversion of fibroblast into myofibroblasts. These cells, initially identified upon wound healing, exhibit similar properties to those observed in fibroblasts associated with aggressive adenocarcinomas. Indeed, analyses of tumors with distinct severity revealed the existence of multiple distinct co-existing subtypes of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), with specific marker protein profiling. Chronic oxidative stress deeply modifies the proportion of these different fibroblast subtypes, further supporting tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. At last, ROS have been implicated in the metabolic reprogramming of both cancer cells and CAFs, allowing an adaptation to oxidative stress that ultimately promotes tumorigenesis and chemoresistance. In this review, we discuss the role of ROS in cancer cells and CAFs and their impact on tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis.",

CAFs respond dynamically to a cancer cell's fluctuating demands by shifting profitable signals necessary in metastasis. Local, tissue-resident fibroblasts and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) coming from reservoir sites such as bone marrow and adipose tissue are the main progenitor cells of CAFs. CAFs may induce awakening from metastatic dormancy, a major cause of cancer-specific death. Cancer management protocols influence CAF precursor recruitment and CAF activation.

However, it remains largely unknown how these cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumor growth and metastasis, driving chemotherapy resistance and poor clinical outcome. This review summarizes new findings on CAF signaling pathways and their emerging metabolic phenotypes that promote tumor growth. Although it is well established that altered cancer metabolism enhances tumor growth, little is known about the role of fibroblast metabolism in tumor growth. New studies reveal that metabolic coupling occurs between catabolic fibroblasts and anabolic cancer cells, in many types of human tumors, including breast, prostate, and head & neck cancers, as well as lymphomas. These catabolic phenotypes observed in CAFs are secondary to a ROS-induced metabolic stress response. Mechanistically, this occurs via HIF1-alpha and NF\u03baB signaling, driving oxidative stress, autophagy, glycolysis and senescence in stromal fibroblasts. These catabolic CAFs then create a nutrient-rich microenvironment, to metabolically support tumor growth, via the local stromal generation of mitochondrial fuels (lactate, ketone bodies, fatty acids, glutamine, and other amino acids). New biomarkers of this catabolic CAF phenotype (such as caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and MCT4), which are reversible upon treatment with anti-oxidants, are strong predictors of poor clinical outcome in various types of human cancers. How cancer cells metabolically reprogram fibroblasts can also help us to understand the effects of cancer cells at an organismal level, explaining para-neoplastic phenomena, such as cancer cachexia. In conclusion, cancer should be viewed more as a systemic disease, that engages the host-organism in various forms of energy-transfer and metabolic co-operation, across a whole-body \u201cecosystem\u201d.",

Accumulating evidence suggest that the stroma compartment also contains independent prognostic information, best exemplified by the impact of immune cells and cells of the vasculature on cancer progression. Similarly, strong experimental evidence exist that stromal fibroblasts, often designated cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs), are actively involved in tumorigenesis. Thus, it can be anticipated that the molecular repertoire of CAFs is likewise important for the clinical behavior of the tumor. In this review we present recent studies addressing the prognostic impact of CAFs, with the focus on human lung and breast cancer. Several single markers have been suggested, either CAF specific or CAF derived, that in immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated independent association with survival. This includes members of the platelet derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) family, CAF-markers like podoplanin and fibroblast activation protein (FAP) as well as transcription factors (FoxF1) and secreted factors (matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), SPARC). However, most studies are based on explorative evaluations on single patient cohorts and require further validation. Using a more comprehensive approach, microarray studies have been employed to create gene expression signatures that detect an activated fibroblast state. These \u201cstroma signatures\u201d have been applied to identify specific CAF features associated with prognosis in several independent data sets of breast and lung cancer patients. Early studies in breast cancer have also demonstrated that fibroblast features influence therapy response.Thus, many strategies have been used to present encouraging proof-of-concept findings that CAFs could be exploited for prognostication.

The clinical relevance of this phenomenon is different according to B-cell count: high-count MBL is considered a preneoplastic condition and progresses to CLL requiring treatment at a rate of 1\u20132% per year, while low-count MBL, though persisting over time, has not shown a clinical correlation with frank leukemia so far. MBL other than CLL-like represent a minority of cases and are ill-defined entities for which clinical and biological information is still scanty.

The localization of these cells indicates that germinal centers or mantle zones provide appropriate microenvironments for cells carrying these oncogenic alterations to survive or proliferate.

To overcome this threat, tumor cells and their precursors depend on anti-apoptotic and growth stimulating factors that are obtained via triggering of multiple membrane receptors. In addition, tumor cells shape the environment by producing a wide variety of chemokines and cytokines. These factors alter the composition of the microenvironment and modulate the nature and effectiveness of the infiltrating cells. The attracted cells enhance the pro-survival and growth stimulating signals for the tumor cells. To escape from an effective anti-tumor response tumor cells avoid recognition by T and NK cells, by downregulation of HLA molecules and modulating NK and T-cell receptors. In addition, the tumor cells produce immune suppressive cytokines that inhibit cytotoxic responses.

First, the direct link between autoimmunity and lymphomagenesis has been strengthened by large epidemiological studies showing a consistent risk increase of lymphoma associated with certain autoimmune/inflammatory conditions in independent cohorts from different countries. Second, a number of local and systemic disease-related risk factors in these diseases have been repeatedly linked to lymphoma development, with the prime examples being disease severity and the degree of inflammatory activity.

The interactions between sex hormone pathways and the epigenetic machineries that influence chromatin states in NAFLD provide potential molecular mechanisms of gender disparity in HCC.

Methods to stratify cancer risk based on endoscopic and histologic findings or serologic testing of pepsinogen levels and H. pylori testing have been developed producing practical primary and secondary gastric cancer prevention strategies. H. pylori eradication halts progressive mucosal damage. Cure of the infection in those with non-atrophic gastritis will essentially prevent subsequent development of gastric cancer. For all, the age-related progression in cancer risk is halted and likely reduced as eradication reduces or eliminates mucosal inflammation and reverses or reduces H. pylori-associated molecular events such aberrant activation-induced cytidine deaminase expression, double strand DNA breaks, impaired DNA mismatch repair and aberrant DNA methylation. Those who have developed atrophic gastritis/gastric atrophy however retain some residual risk for gastric cancer which is proportional to the extent and severity of atrophic gastritis. Primary and secondary cancer prevention starts with H. pylori eradication and cancer risk stratification to identify those at higher risk who should also be considered for secondary cancer prevention programs. Japan has embarked on population-wide H. pylori eradication coupled with surveillance targeted to those with significant remaining risk. We anticipate that countries with high gastric cancer burdens will follow their lead. We provide specific recommendations on instituting practical primary and secondary gastric cancer prevention programs as well identifying research needed to make elimination of gastric cancer both efficient and cost effective.",

Recently, it was reported that targeting stromal events could improve efficacies of current therapeutics and prevent metastatic spreading. Tumor microenvironment is a \u201ccomplex network\u201d of different cell types, soluble factors, signaling molecules and extracellular matrix components, which orchestrate the fate of tumor progression. As by definition, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are proposed to be the unique cell type able to maintain tumor mass and survive outside the primary tumor at metastatic sites. Being exposed to environmental stressors, including reactive oxygen species (ROS), CSCs have developed a GSH-dependent antioxidant system to improve ROS defense capability and acquire a malignant phenotype. Nevertheless, tumor progression is dependent on extracellular matrix remodeling, fibroblasts and macrophages activation in response to oxidative stress, as well as epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing signals and endothelial and perivascular cells recruitment. Besides providing a survival advantage by inducing de novo angiogenesis, tumor-associated vessels contribute to successful dissemination by facilitating tumor cells entry into the circulatory system and driving the formation of pre-metastatic niche. In this review, we focus on the synergistic effect of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) and vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) in the successful outgrowth of metastasis, integrating therefore many of the emerging models and theories in the field.",

     "abstract": "The dysregulation of apoptosis is a key step in developing cancers, and mediates resistance to cancer therapy. Commitment to apoptosis is caused by permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane, a process regulated by the interactions between different proteins of Bcl-2 family. Furthermore, Bcl-2 family proteins also bind to the endoplasmic reticulum, where they modulate autophagy, another important pathway regulating cell survival and death. Dysregulation of Bcl-2 family has been demonstrated in a wide spectrum of human cancers, including gastrointestinal cancers. Therefore, targeting the Bcl-2 family of proteins represents a promising therapeutic approach for these malignancies. Recent advances have yielded small molecules that have close structural or functional similarity to BH3-only proteins and are therefore named BH3 mimetics. Of these BH3 mimetics, obatoclax, (\u2212)-gossypol, and ABT-263 are currently in clinical trials for multiple cancers. Growing evidence indicates that these BH3 mimetics not only induce apoptosis, but also regulate autophagy which may serve as a pro-survival or pro-death mechanism to counteract or mediate the cytotoxicity of BH3 mimetics. This review discusses the role of autophagy in cell-fate decision upon BH3 mimetics treatment. Further exploration of our understanding of the association between autophagy and cellular outcomes in response to BH3 mimetics treatment will likely offer improved therapies for patients with cancer.",

The non-primate mammalian members of the Hepadnaviridae include the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV), the ground squirrel hepatitis virus and arctic squirrel virus, as well as the recently described bat hepatitis virus. The identification of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in higher primates such as chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, and gibbons that cluster with the human genotypes further implies a more complex origin of this virus.

Finally, strategies for the management of lymphomas developing due to viral and bacterial infection as well as novel promising therapies designed to hit specific cellular pathways (e.g. B-cell receptor inhibitors) will be summarized and discussed.

This corruption of the normal B cell response to antigens, leading to sustained BcR signaling, has given great impulse to investigate in detail the role of antigen in lymphomas. Suffice it to conclude from such studies, largely immunogenetics based, that the evidence implicating antigens (exogenous or self) in lymphoma development is substantial and that lymphomagenesis is functionally driven and dynamic, rather than a simple stochastic process. As the paradigm of antigen-driven lymphoma evolves, further investigation will be paramount to the identification of the inciting agent(s) that may be responsible for immunoproliferative neoplasms and also for the development of therapeutic agents targeting effectors of the BcR signaling pathway.",

     "abstract": "The B-cell receptor (BCR) is essential for normal B-cell development and maturation. In an increasing number of B-cell malignancies, BCR signaling is implicated as a pivotal pathway in tumorigenesis. Mechanisms of BCR activation are quite diverse and range from chronic antigenic drive by microbial or viral antigens to autostimulation of B-cells by self-antigens to activating mutations in intracellular components of the BCR pathway. Hepatitis C virus infection can lead to the development of splenic marginal zone lymphoma, while Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas. In some of these cases, successful treatment of the infection removes the inciting antigen and results in resolution of the lymphoma. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia has been recognized for decades as a malignancy of auto-reactive B-cells and its clinical course is in part determined by the differential response of the malignant cells to BCR activation. In a number of B-cell malignancies, activating mutations in signal transduction components of the BCR pathway have been identified; prominent examples are activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) that carry mutations in CD79B and CARD11 and display chronic active BCR signaling resulting in constitutive activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. Despite considerable heterogeneity in biology and clinical course, many mature B-cell malignancies are highly sensitive to kinase inhibitors that disrupt BCR signaling. Thus, targeted therapy through inhibition of BCR signaling is emerging as a new treatment paradigm for many B-cell malignancies. Here, we review the role of the BCR in the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies and summarize clinical results of the emerging class of kinase inhibitors that target this pathway.",

Besides operating as a quality control mechanism in steady-state conditions, autophagy is upregulated in response to a variety of homeostatic perturbations. In this setting, autophagy mediates prominent cytoprotective effects as it sustains energetic homeostasis and contributes to the removal of cytotoxic stimuli, thus orchestrating a cell-wide, multipronged adaptive response to stress. In line with the critical role of autophagy in health and disease, defects in the autophagic machinery as well as in autophagy-regulatory signaling pathways have been associated with multiple human pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune conditions and cancer. Accumulating evidence indicates that the autophagic response to stress may proceed in two phases. Thus, a rapid increase in the autophagic flux, which occurs within minutes or hours of exposure to stressful conditions and is entirely mediated by post-translational protein modifications, is generally followed by a delayed and protracted autophagic response that relies on the activation of specific transcriptional programs.

Viruses are adept at subverting host cellular pathways for their replication and survival. The human tumor viruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Kaposi's Sarcoma-Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), and Hepatitis C virus (HCV), have evolved novel ways of modulating autophagy during productive and latent stages of the virus life cycle. This review will discuss how the autophagy pathway becomes activated upon viral infection and the role of viral proteins in regulating the autophagy pathway. Specifically, we will examine how virus-encoded homologs of autophagy proteins evade autophagy-mediated degradation by blocking the induction, elongation, or maturation steps in the autophagy pathway. We will also discuss how certain viruses enhance autophagy induction or usurp autophagic machinery for their own replication. A comprehensive understanding of the autophagic response to tumor viruses may enable the discovery of novel antiviral and/or anticancer drug therapies.",

     "abstract": "As the principle lysosomal mediated mechanism for the degradation of aged or damaged organelles and proteins, autophagy (self-eating) is generally considered a pro-survival process activated by cells to sustain life in presence of adverse environmental conditions such as nutrient shortage and/or in presence of cytotoxic compounds [1]. Upon activation, cytoplasmic material is sequestered into double-membrane vesicles (autophagosomes) then targeted for degradation by fusion with lysosomes (autolysosomes); metabolic activity and cell survival are consequently sustained by recycling the degradation products. Basal autophagy occurs in almost all cell types, though at different degree, as a finely regulated \u201cquality control\u201d process to prevent cell damage, for the demolition of cellular structures during cell/tissue remodelling, and to ensure the maintenance of cellular homeostasis through recycling cellular components/molecules [2], [3].Autophagy is stimulated in response to both physiological and pathological conditions such as starvation, hypoxia and low energy, pathogen infection and protein aggregates.Although it's clear that autophagy is also involved in cancer, its role, however, is complex since it can both suppress and promote tumorigenesis [4]. Consequently, it is generally accepted that while autophagy is used by advanced stage cancers to maintain tumour survival, loss of autophagy in earlier stages is associated with tumour development.Accordingly, it is now apparent that aberrant control of autophagy is among key hallmarks of cancer, with several studies now demonstrating this process is deregulated also in melanoma [5], [6].",

Cells constantly weigh up signals from their environment against their own integrity and metabolic status and decide whether to live or die. Such cell death decisions are central to the progression and treatment of cancer. The term autophagy describes three processes that deliver cytoplasmic macromolecules and organelles to lysosomes for degradation, the difference between each form being the method of delivery. The most extensively studied form is macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) where cytosolic components are engulfed by double membraned autophagosomes. Autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form structures called autolysosomes, within which organelles, proteins and other macromolecules are degraded by catabolic enzymes in the acidic lysosome environment. Autophagy, which normally occurs at low levels in unstressed cells, is widely regarded as having a positive effect on cell health as potentially harmful protein aggregates and damaged organelles can be recycled. During periods of nutrient shortage autophagy is enhanced to provide, albeit temporarily, an internal energy source. Autophagy is also enhanced by other stresses encountered by tumour cells and this may protect the cell or aid its demise. In this review we examine the effect of autophagy on cell death decisions in tumour cells.",

They influence each other reciprocally, initiating individual pathways, mediating and/or inducing effector mechanisms and modifying cellular function. High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), is a prototypic DAMP molecule, with various roles depending on its compartmental localization (nuclear, cytosolic, extracellular), well-defined but rather promiscuous binding partners, and the redox status within or without the cell. Typically, HMGB1 serves as a redox sensor, where redox modification also defines its translocation, release and activity, illustrative of the coordinate and multiply determined paths involved in the response to cell stress. Since DAMPs, redox and autophagy are essential and multifaceted in their roles in host defense, inflammation, and homeostasis, understanding how they interact and coordinate various signaling pathways to adjust to the stressful environment is important in the development of various potential therapeutic strategies, including application to patients with cancer.",

All of these rely on the presentation of small protein waste fragments, which are generated by a variety of catabolic pathways, including macroautophagy, on major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules.

Finally to high-light that macroautophagy is always intimately interconnected with cell death in addition to the various supported vesicular transport function, its role in lymphocyte, especially T cell, development and function will be discussed.

Network analysis of cancer-specific metabolic and signaling pathways highlighted the structural features of cancer-related proteins and their complexes to develop next-generation protein kinase inhibitors, as well as the modulation of inflammatory and autophagic pathways in anti-cancer therapies. Importantly, malignant transformation can be described as a two-phase process, where an initial increase of system plasticity is followed by a decrease of plasticity at late stages of tumor development. Late-stage tumors should be attacked by an indirect network influence strategy. On the contrary, the attack of early-stage tumors may target central network nodes. Cancer stem cells need special diagnosis and targeting, since they potentially have an extremely high ability to change the rigidity/plasticity of their networks. The early warning signals of the activation of fast growing tumor cell clones are important in personalized diagnosis and therapy. Multi-target attacks are needed to perturb cancer-specific networks to exit from cancer attractors and re-enter a normal attractor. However, the dynamic non-genetic heterogeneity of cancer cell population induces the replenishment of the cancer attractor with surviving, non-responsive cells from neighboring abnormal attractors. The development of drug resistance is further complicated by interactions of tumor clones and their microenvironment. Network analysis of intercellular cooperation using game theory approaches may open new areas of understanding tumor complexity. In conclusion, the above applications of the network approach open up new, and highly promising avenues in anti-cancer drug design.",

First, we discuss why a single constitutively active kinase emanating from a variety of aberrant genetic alterations is capable of transforming a normal cell, leading it to acquire the hallmarks of a cancer cell. To draw attention to the fact that kinase inhibition in targeted cancer therapeutics differs from conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, we exploit a conceptual framework explaining why suppressed kinase activity will selectively kill only the so-called oncogene \u2018addicted\u2019 cancer cell, while sparing the healthy cell. Second, we introduce the protein kinase superfamily in light of its common active conformation with precisely positioned structural elements, and the diversified auto-inhibitory conformations among the kinase families. Understanding the detailed activation mechanism of individual kinases is essential to relate the observed oncogenic alterations to the elevated constitutively active state, to identify the mechanism of consequent drug resistance, and to guide the development of the next-generation inhibitors. To clarify the vital importance of structural guidelines in studies of oncogenesis, we explain how somatic mutations in EGFR result in kinase constitutive activation. Third, in addition to the common theme of secondary (acquired) mutations that prevent drug binding from blocking a signaling pathway which is hijacked by the aberrant activated kinase, we discuss scenarios of drug resistance and relapse by compensating lesions that bypass the inactivated pathway in a vertical or horizontal fashion. Collectively, these suggest that the future challenge of cancer therapy with small molecule kinase inhibitors will rely on the discovery of distinct combinations of optimized drugs to target individual subtypes of different cancers.",

     "abstract": "Autophagy, a highly regulated self-degradation process of eukaryotic cells, is a context-dependent tumor-suppressing mechanism that can also promote tumor cell survival upon stress and treatment resistance. Because of this ambiguity, autophagy is considered as a double-edged sword in oncology, making anti-cancer therapeutic approaches highly challenging. In this review, we present how systems-level knowledge on autophagy regulation can help to develop new strategies and efficiently select novel anti-cancer drug targets. We focus on the protein interactors and transcriptional/post-transcriptional regulators of autophagy as the protein and regulatory networks significantly influence the activity of core autophagy proteins during tumor progression. We list several network resources to identify interactors and regulators of autophagy proteins. As in silico analysis of such networks often necessitates experimental validation, we briefly summarize tractable model organisms to examine the role of autophagy in cancer. We also discuss fluorescence techniques for high-throughput monitoring of autophagy in humans. Finally, the challenges of pharmacological modulation of autophagy are reviewed. We suggest network-based concepts to overcome these difficulties. We point out that a context-dependent modulation of autophagy would be favored in anti-cancer therapy, where autophagy is stimulated in normal cells, while inhibited only in stressed cancer cells. To achieve this goal, we introduce the concept of regulo-network drugs targeting specific transcription factors or miRNA families identified with network analysis. The effect of regulo-network drugs propagates indirectly through transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of autophagy proteins, and, as a multi-directional intervention tool, they can both activate and inhibit specific proteins in the same time. The future identification and validation of such regulo-network drug targets may serve as novel intervention points, where autophagy can be effectively modulated in cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "There is a widening recognition that cancer cells are products of complex developmental processes. Carcinogenesis and metastasis formation are increasingly described as systems-level, network phenomena. Here we propose that malignant transformation is a two-phase process, where an initial increase of system plasticity is followed by a decrease of plasticity at late stages of carcinogenesis as a model of cellular learning. We describe the hallmarks of increased system plasticity of early, tumor initiating cells, such as increased noise, entropy, conformational and phenotypic plasticity, physical deformability, cell heterogeneity and network rearrangements. Finally, we argue that the large structural changes of molecular networks during cancer development necessitate a rather different targeting strategy in early and late phase of carcinogenesis. Plastic networks of early phase cancer development need a central hit, while rigid networks of late stage primary tumors or established metastases should be attacked by the network influence strategy, such as by edgetic, multi-target, or allo-network drugs. Cancer stem cells need special diagnosis and targeting, since their dormant and rapidly proliferating forms may have more rigid, or more plastic networks, respectively. The extremely high ability of cancer stem cells to change the rigidity/plasticity of their networks may be their key hallmark. The application of early stage-optimized anti-cancer drugs to late-stage patients may be a reason of many failures in anti-cancer therapies. Our hypotheses presented here underlie the need for patient-specific multi-target therapies applying the correct ratio of central hits and network influences \u2014 in an optimized sequence.",

A widely proposed approach to conquer therapy resistance is to depart from the myopic focus on individual causal pathways and instead target multiple nodes in the cancer cell's gene regulatory network. However, most ideas rely on a simplistic conceptualization of networks: utilizing solely their topology and treating it as a display of causal interactions, while ignoring the integrated dynamics in state space. Here, we review the more encompassing formal framework of global network dynamics in which cancer cells, like normal cell types, are high-dimensional attractor states. Then therapy is represented by the network perturbation that will promote the exit from such cancer attractors and reentering a normal attractor. We show in this qualitative and accessible discussion how the idea of a quasi-potential landscape and the theory of least-action-path offer a new formal understanding for computing the set of network nodes (molecular targets) that need to be targeted in concert in order to exit the cancer attractor. But targeting cancer cells based on the network configuration of an \u201caverage\u201d cancer cell, however precise, may not suffice to eradicate all tumor cells because of the dynamic non-genetic heterogeneity of cancer cell populations that makes them moving targets and drives the replenishment of the cancer attractor with surviving, non-responsive cells from neighboring abnormal attractors.",

The majority of bladder tumors are non-muscle invasive at diagnosis, and there is a high rate of tumor recurrence and progression even after local surgical therapy. Thus, many patients require lifelong follow-up examinations that include additional prophylactic treatments in the event of recurrence. Since its first use in 1976, Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette\u2013Guerin (BCG) has been the treatment of choice for non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Despite nearly 40 years of clinical use, the mechanism(s) by which intravesical administration of BCG results in elimination of bladder tumors remains undefined. Granulocytes (polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN)) are the predominant immune cell (in number) that enters the bladder after BCG installation, and a number of studies have highlighted the importance of PMN in the antitumor activity of BCG. Studies from our laboratory demonstrated presence of intracellular stores of the apoptosis-inducing protein TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in PMN that are rapidly released after interaction with BCG cell wall components, along with a correlation between increased urinary levels of TRAIL and BCG responsiveness. Mature PMN in circulation are terminally differentiated cells with limited biosynthetic capacity, so the proteins located in the distinct PMN granule populations are compartmentalized concomitant with their synthesis during myelopoiesis. Thus, understanding PMN production, localization, and release of TRAIL is important in the design of future BCG-based bladder tumor immunotherapy protocols.",

A striking finding is the notion that high baseline neutrophil count in either tumor or blood, or both, was identified as strong, independent risk factor for poor outcome in multivariate analyses, and the negative prognostic impact of neutrophils was not eliminated by increasing the dose of cytokines, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy. For several cancers, patients benefit most from therapy if baseline neutrophil was low. Thus, baseline neutrophils over-ride nadir counts in prognostic significance.In summary, a proportion of patients who do not experience benefit from surgery or medical intervention may be associated with a worst prognosis because they are characterized by baseline tumor-related neutrophilia protecting them from benefit from therapy.

DNA replication initiates from thousands of origins scattered throughout the genome every cell cycle; however, not all origins initiate replication at the same time. A vast amount of work over the years indicates that different origins along each eukaryotic chromosome are activated in early, middle or late S phase. This temporal control of DNA replication is referred to as the replication-timing program. The replication-timing program represents a very stable epigenetic feature of chromosomes. Recent evidence has indicated that the replication-timing program can influence the spatial distribution of mutagenic events such that certain regions of the genome experience increased spontaneous mutagenesis compared to surrounding regions. This influence has helped shape the genomes of humans and other multicellular organisms and can affect the distribution of mutations in somatic cells. It is also becoming clear that the replication-timing program is deregulated in many disease states, including cancer. Aberrant DNA replication timing is associated with changes in gene expression, changes in epigenetic modifications and an increased frequency of structural rearrangements. Furthermore, certain replication timing changes can directly lead to overt genomic instability and may explain unique mutational signatures that are present in cells that have undergone the recently described processes of \u201cchromothripsis\u201d and \u201ckataegis\u201d.

     "abstract": "In recent years it has been recognized that the development of cancer involves a series of not only genetic but epigenetic changes across the genome. At the same time, connections between epigenetic regulation, chromatin packaging, and overall nuclear architecture are increasingly appreciated. The cell-type specific organization of heterochromatin, established upon cell differentiation, is responsible for maintaining much of the genome in a repressed state, within a highly compartmentalized nucleus. This review focuses on recent evidence that in cancer the normal packaging and higher organization of heterochromatin is often compromised. Gross changes in nuclear morphology have long been a criterion for pathologic diagnosis of many cancers, but the specific nuclear components impacted, the mechanisms involved, and the implications for cancer progression have barely begun to emerge. We discuss recent findings regarding distinct heterochromatin types, including the inactive X chromosome, constitutive heterochromatin of peri/centric satellites, and the peripheral heterochromatic compartment (PHC). A theme developed here is that the higher-order organization of satellites and the peripheral heterochromatic compartment may be tightly linked, and that compromise of this organization may promote broad epigenomic imbalance in cancer. Recent studies into the potential role(s) of the breast cancer tumor suppressor, BRCA1, in maintaining heterochromatin will be highlighted. Many questions remain about this new area of cancer epigenetics, which is likely more important in cancer development and progression than widely appreciated. We propose that broad, stochastic compromise in heterochromatin maintenance would create a diversity of expression profiles, and thus a rich opportunity for one or more cells to emerge with a selective growth advantage and potential for neoplasia.",

Even today, nuclear morphology measures include nuclear size, shape, DNA content (ploidy) and \u2018chromatin organization\u2019. Given the importance of nuclear shape to diagnoses of cancer phenotypes, it is surprising and frustrating that we currently lack a detailed understanding to explain these changes and how they might arise and relate to molecular events in the cell. It is an implicit hypothesis that perturbation of chromatin and epigenetic signatures may lead to alterations in nuclear structure (or vice versa) and that these perturbations lie at the heart of cancer genesis. In this review, we attempt to synthesize research leading to our current understanding on how chromatin interactions at the nuclear lamina, epigenetic modulation and gene regulation may intersect in cancer and offer a perspective on critical experiments that would help clarify how nuclear architecture may contribute to the cancerous phenotype. We also discuss the historical understanding of nuclear structure in normal cells and as a diagnostic in cancer.",

Several newly identified nuclear envelope functions associated with these connections intersect with cancer pathways. For example, the nuclear envelope could affect genome stability by tethering chromatin. Some nuclear envelope proteins affect cell cycle regulation by directly binding to the master regulator pRb, others by interacting with TGF-\u00df and Smad signaling cascades, and others by affecting the mitotic spindle. Finally, the NE directly affects cytoskeletal organization and can also influence cell migration in metastasis. In this review we discuss the link between the nuclear envelope and cellular defects that are common in cancer cells, and we show that NE proteins are often aberrantly expressed in tumors.

The RCCs emanate from the renal tubule, a highly heterogeneous epithelial structure, and depending on which cell is malignified the resulting cancer displays unique characteristics. Notwithstanding this, the cells of origin for the RCC forms are far from established, and only inferred by the accumulated weight of marker similarities, not always providing an unequivocal picture. The tubular epithelium is normally mitotically quiescent, but demonstrates a considerable regenerative capacity upon renal injury. Recently the hypothesis that regeneration is driven by adult stem cells has been added experimental support, providing further complexity to the issue of renal carcinogenesis. Whether these cells are linked to RCC is an open question. In the present review we therefore present the prevailing theories regarding kidney regeneration, since a better understanding of this process might be of relevance when considering the different malignancies that arise from kidney epithelium. Our own results show that papillary renal cell carcinoma displays considerable similarities to proximal tubular progenitor cells and we suggest that this tumor form may develop in a multi-step fashion via benign renal adenomas. The putative connection between renal stem cells and carcinomas is, however, not clarified, since the current understanding of the renal stem cell system is not complete. It is clear that the efforts to isolate and characterize renal progenitor/stem cells suffer from numerous technical limitations and that it remains likely that the kidney harbors different stem cell pools with a restricted differentiation potential.",

In this paper we propose a new fundamental mechanobiological mechanism involved in cancer growth and metastasis, which can be both protective or destructive depending on the magnitude of the forces generated by the cells. This new mechanobiological mechanism directly challenges current paradigms that are focused mainly on biological and biochemical mechanisms associated with tumor metastasis. Our new mechanobiological mechanism describes how tumor expansion generates mechanical forces within the stroma to not only resist tumor expansion but also inhibit or enhance tumor invasion by, respectively, inhibiting or enhancing matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) degradation of the tensed interstitial collagen. While this mechanobiological mechanism has not been previously applied to the study of tumor metastasis and EMT, it may have the potential to broaden our understanding of the tumor invasive process and assist in developing new strategies for preventing or treating cancer metastasis.",

However, in most malignancies, the subsequent outgrowth of micrometastatic deposits into macroscopic metastases has the greatest impact on clinical progression. Such metastatic \u201ccolonization\u201d reflects the ability of disseminated tumor cells to adapt to a foreign tissue microenvironment. The outgrowth of a metastasis is also thought to be associated with self-renewal, the defining cellular trait of cancer stem cells (CSCs), also termed tumor-initiating cells. Importantly, molecular links between EMT-TFs and self-renewal have emerged, suggesting that EMT programs play critical roles both early and late in the metastatic cascade. The genetic and epigenetic mechanisms that regulate the activation of EMT-TFs and the traits they induce are areas under intensive investigation.

However, in the past couple of years it has become apparent that extensive changes in alternative splicing also play a profound role in shaping the changes in cell behavior that characterize the EMT. While long known splicing switches in FGFR2 and p120-catenin provided hints of a larger program of EMT-associated alternative splicing, the recent identification of the epithelial splicing regulatory proteins 1 and 2 (ESRP1 and ESRP2) began to reveal this genome-wide post-transcriptional network. Several studies have now demonstrated the truly vast extent of this alternative splicing program. The global switches in splicing associated with the EMT add an important additional layer of post-transcriptional control that works in harmony with transcriptional and epigenetic regulation to effect complex changes in cell shape, polarity, and behavior that mediate transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal cell states.

TGF-\u03b2 cooperates with stem cell pathways, such as Wnt and Ras signaling, to induce EMT. In addition, TGF-\u03b2 contributes to an EMT-permissive microenvironment by switching the phenotypes of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, which thereby mount pro-invasive and pro-metastatic immune responses. In this review, we discuss the role of TGF-\u03b2-induced EMT as a link between cancer and inflammation in the context of questions, which from our point of view are key to answer in order to understand the functionality of EMT in tumors.",

     "abstract": "Tumors have been increasingly recognized as organs with a complexity that approaches, and may even exceed, that of healthy tissues. When viewed from this perspective, the biology of a tumor can be understood only by studying tumor cell heterogeneity and the microenvironment that is constructed during the course of tumorigenesis and malignant progression. Recent work has revealed the existence of cancer stem cells, the \u201cbugs\u201d, with the capacity for self-renewal and tumor propagation. In addition, it is now recognized that the tumor microenvironment, the \u201cbed\u201d, plays a critical role in supporting cancer stem cells and also may promote neoplasia and malignant progression. The interdependence of the cell-intrinsic features of cancer, including the cancer stem cell \u201cbugs\u201d and the tumor microenvironment \u201cbed\u201d, is only beginning to be understood. In this review, we highlight the rapidly evolving concepts about the interactions between tumor stem cells and their microenvironment, the insights gained from studying their normal tissue counterparts, and the questions and controversies surrounding this area of research, with an emphasis on breast and lung cancer. Finally, we address evidence supporting the notion that eliminating the bed as well as the bugs should lead to more effective and personalized cancer treatments that improve patient outcome.",

The term, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) describes the changes in molecular biology and cellular physiology that allow a cell to transition from a sedentary cell to a motile cell, a process that is relevant not only for cancer and regeneration, but also for normal development of multicellular organisms. The present review compares the similarities and differences in cellular response at the molecular level as tumor cells enter EMT or as keratinocytes begin the process of re-epithelialization of a wound. Looking toward clinical interventions that might modulate these processes, the mechanisms and outcomes of current and potential therapies are reviewed for both anti-cancer and pro-wound healing treatments related to the pathways that are central to EMT. Taken together, the comparison of re-epithelialization and tumor EMT serves as a starting point for the development of therapies that can selectively modulate different forms of EMT.",

Many pre-clinical and clinical studies demonstrate an inversed correlation between macrophage infiltrate and patients\u2019 prognosis indicating a macrophage supporting role for tumor progression as producers of growth and angiogenic factors and as regulators of tissue remodelling. Based on in vitro models, macrophages have been classified in pro-inflammatory, classically activated macrophages (M1; stimulated by IFN-\u03b3 or LPS) and anti-inflammatory, alternatively activated macrophages (M2; stimulated by either IL-4/IL-13, IL-1\u03b2/LPS in combination with immune complexes or by IL-10/TGF\u03b2/glucocorticoids). Tumor escape has been linked with a switch from M1 activation in the early tumor initiation process towards M2-like phenotype during tumor progression, a process that highlights the heterogeneity and plasticity of macrophage activation and which offers a possible therapeutic target directed against reversing the TAM phenotype in the tumor. Here, we review different tumor-environmental stimuli and signalling cascades involved in this switch in differentiation and the so connected gene regulation in TAMs. In addition, therapeutic applications deducted from this differentiation and gene regulatory processes are presented.

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a common factor linking various pathologies that differ in their etiology and physiology such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections. At a certain stage of each of these diseases, while the chronic inflammation proceeds, some key players of the immune system become immunosuppressed as natural killer (NK) cells and T cells. The suppressive environment induced during chronic inflammation is governed by a complex processes characterized by the accumulation and activation of immune suppressor cells, pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, growth and angiogenic factors, and by the activation of several inflammatory signaling pathways mediated predominantly by NF\u03baB and STAT3 transcription factors. A substantial body of evidence supports the notion that the development of a suppressive environment during chronic inflammation limits the success of immune-based and conventional therapies, skewing the balance in favor of a developing pathology. Thus, appropriate, well-designed and fine tuned immune interventions that could resolve inflammatory responses and associated immunosuppression could enhance disease regression and reinforce successful responses to a given therapy. This review describes the interrelationship between chronic inflammation and induced immunosuppression, and explains the current evidence linking inflammation and pathological processes, as found in cancer. We further highlight potential strategies, harnessing the immunosuppressive environment in treating autoimmune diseases and facilitating transplantation. In parallel, we emphasize the use of modalities to combat chronic inflammation-induced immunosuppression in cancer, to enhance the success of immune-based therapies leading to tumor regression. In both cases, the urgent necessity of identifying biomarkers for the evaluation of host immune status is discussed, with the goal of developing optimal personalized treatments.",

Well-defined immunogenic capacities of melanoma cells should allow a successful application of different immunotherapeutic strategies. However, the overall results of immunotherapeutic clinical studies are not satisfactory. These paradoxical observations are supposed to be due to the profound immunosuppression mediated by different mechanisms dealing with alterations in tumor and surrounding stroma cells. Melanoma microenvironment has been characterized by a remarkable accumulation of highly immunosuppressive regulatory leucocytes, in particular, myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). Their migration, retention and high activity in the tumor lesions have been demonstrated to be induced by chronic inflammatory conditions developing in the tumor microenvironment and characterized by the long-term secretion of various inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, prostaglandins etc.) leading to further cancer progression.

     "abstract": "The role regulatory T cells (Treg) play in cancer development and progression is not clear. Earlier evidence suggested that CD4+FOXP3+CD25high Treg accumulate in tumors and the peripheral blood of patients with cancer and through suppression of anti-tumor immune responses promote tumor growth. However, more recent data indicate that in certain cancers, such as colorectal carcinoma (CRC), Treg suppress bacteria-driven inflammation which promotes carcinogenesis and thus benefit the host. Treg appear to play a dual role in cancer. This might explain why the frequency and functions of Treg are associated with a poor prognosis in some cancers but with favorable outcome in others.The clinical and prognostic significance of Treg in cancer depends on environmental factors, including infectious agents, tumor-derived products and locally-produced cytokines, which shape the nature of immune responses, including Treg generation, recruitment and survival. Adaptive or inducible (i) Treg or Tr1 are the major subset(s) of Treg present in cancer. These iTreg are a distinct subset of regulatory cells that phenotypically and functionally differ from FOXP3+ natural (n) Treg responsible for peripheral tolerance. They mediate powerful suppression of effector T cells via diverse mechanisms, produce immunosuppressive cytokines, notably TGF-\u03b2 as well as prostaglandin E2 and adenosine, and are resistant to apoptosis or oncological therapies. Strategies for silencing of Tr1 in patients with cancer will require novel approaches that can selectively deplete these cells or block molecular pathways they utilize.",

In addition, amino acid, lipid and adenosine metabolism are adapted to fulfill the tumors needs for energy and generation of building blocks such as lipids and nucleotides for new cell structures. The altered tumor metabolism leads to accumulation of specific metabolites in the tumor environment and creates a favorable milieu for tumor growth, progression and metastasis. These tumor-derived metabolites are important players in immune escape mechanisms beside other known factors such as cytokines, chemokines and growth factors. A variety of metabolites re-educate immune cells and prevent an effective immune response against tumor cells. Furthermore, tumor infiltrating immune cells support tumor growth by the secretion of cytokines, growth factors and other metabolic determinants. Hence, a complex interplay of tumor metabolites, cytokines and stromal factors is active in tumors and facilitates their establishment and growth. Pharmacological blockade of tumor metabolites could overcome some limitations of cancer treatment and rescue the endogenous immune response against tumor cells.",

Representing the acellular replicas of tumor cells, they contain a great variety of bioactive molecules, such as proteins, RNA, miRNA and DNA. Their great ability to recirculate in body fluids and their structure allow them to transport their cargo to distant targets. Major studies have shown that tumor exosomes convey information not only between tumor cells but also to other cell types, including different immune cell components. There is increasing evidence that these nanovesicles may contribute to cancer progression by influencing different immune cell types, likely blunting specific T cell immunity and skewing innate immune cells toward a pro-tumorigenic phenotype. Because of this function and the additional property to deliver molecular signals modulating neoangiogenesis and stroma remodeling, tumor exosomes are believed to play a role in tumor progression by favoring metastatic niche onset.This review outlines the recent knowledge on immune suppressive mechanisms mediated by tumor exosomes.

     "abstract": "In human tumors alterations in the surface expression and/or function of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I antigens are frequently found and equip neoplastic cells with mechanisms to escape immune control. The aberrant expression of HLA class I molecules can be caused by structural alterations or dysregulations of genes encoding the classical HLA class I antigens and/or components of the HLA class I antigen processing machinery (APM). The dysregulation of APM components could occur at the epigenetic, transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. In some malignancies these abnormalities are significantly associated with a higher tumor staging, grading, disease progression and a reduced survival of patients as well as a failure to CD8+ T cell-based immunotherapies. In addition to HLA class I abnormalities, expression of the non-classical HLA-G antigen is often induced in tumors, which could be mediated by various microenvironmental factors. Interestingly, soluble HLA-G serum and plasma levels have been useful markers for the prediction of some malignancies. The biological consequence of HLA-G expression or sHLA-G is an escape from T and NK cell-mediated recognition.

     "abstract": "The ability of tumor cells to leave a primary tumor, to disseminate through the body, and to ultimately seed new secondary tumors is universally agreed to be the basis for metastasis formation. An accurate description of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie this multistep process would greatly facilitate the rational development of therapies that effectively allow metastatic disease to be controlled and treated. A number of disparate and sometimes conflicting hypotheses and models have been suggested to explain various aspects of the process, and no single concept explains the mechanism of metastasis in its entirety or encompasses all observations and experimental findings. The exciting progress made in metastasis research in recent years has refined existing ideas, as well as giving rise to new ones. In this review we survey some of the main theories that currently exist in the field, and show that significant convergence is emerging, allowing a synthesis of several models to give a more comprehensive overview of the process of metastasis. As a result we postulate a stromal progression model of metastasis. In this model, progressive modification of the tumor microenvironment is equally as important as genetic and epigenetic changes in tumor cells during primary tumor progression. Mutual regulatory interactions between stroma and tumor cells modify the stemness of the cells that drive tumor growth, in a manner that involves epithelial\u2013mesenchymal and mesenchymal\u2013epithelial-like transitions. Similar interactions need to be recapitulated at secondary sites for metastases to grow. Early disseminating tumor cells can progress at the secondary site in parallel to the primary tumor, both in terms of genetic changes, as well as progressive development of a metastatic stroma. Although this model brings together many ideas in the field, there remain nevertheless a number of major open questions, underscoring the need for further research to fully understand metastasis, and thereby identify new and effective ways of treating metastatic disease.",

Notably, several CSC characteristics are relevant to metastasis, such as motility, invasiveness and, as mentioned above, resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis.Here, we have reviewed the current literature on the relation between CSCs and metastasis formation. Preliminary studies on cancer cell lines and patient-derived material suggest a rate-limiting role for stem-like cells in the processes of tumour cell dissemination and metastasis formation.

Loss of polarity is considered both a hallmark and precondition for human cancer. Three conserved polarity protein complexes regulate different modes of polarity that are conserved throughout numerous cell types and species. These complexes are the Crumbs, Par and Scribble complex. Given the importance of cell polarity for normal tissue homeostasis, aberrant polarity signaling is suggested to contribute to the multistep processes of human cancer. Most human cancers are formed from epithelial cells. Evidence confirming the roles for polarity proteins in different phases of the oncogenic trajectory comes from functional studies using mammalian cells as well as Drosophila and zebrafish models. Furthermore, several reports have revealed aberrant expression and localization of polarity proteins in different human tumors. In this review we will give an overview on the current data available that couple polarity signaling to tumorigenesis, particularly in epithelial cells.",

     "abstract": "Despite the substantial advances obtained in the treatment of localized malignancies, metastatic disease still lacks effective treatment and remains the primary cause of cancer mortality, including in breast cancer. Thus, in order to improve the survival of cancer patients it is necessary to effectively improve prevention or treatment of metastasis. To achieve this goal, complementary strategies can be envisaged: the first one is the eradication of established metastases by adding novel modalities to current treatments, such as immunotherapy or targeted therapies. A second one is to prevent tumor cell dissemination to secondary organs by targeting specific steps governing the metastatic cascade and organ-specific tropism. A third one is to block the colonization of secondary organs and subsequent cancer cell growth by impinging on the ability of disseminated cancer cells to adapt to the novel microenvironment. To obtain optimal results it might be necessary to combine these strategies. The development of therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing dissemination and organ colonization requires a deeper understanding of the specific genetic events occurring in cancer cells and of the host responses that co-operate to promote metastasis formation. Recent developments in the field disclosed novel mechanisms of metastasis. In particular the crosstalk between disseminated cancer cells and the host microenvironment is emerging as a critical determinant of metastasis. The identification of tissue-specific signals involved in metastatic progression will open the way to new therapeutic strategies. Here, we will review recent progress in the field, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms of organ specific dissemination and colonization of breast cancer.",

Although many patients can be cured, in the US and UK, cancer still causes 730,000 deaths every year, and it is second only to cardiovascular disease as a cause of death. The functional roles of many critical players involved in metastasis have been delineated in great detail in recent years, due to the draft of the human genome and to many associated discoveries. Here, we address several genetic events and critical factors that define the metastatic phenotype acquired during tumorigenesis. This involves molecular networks that promote local cancer-cell invasion, single-cell invasion, formation of the metastatic microenvironment of primary tumors, intravasation, lymphogenic metastasis, extravasation, and metastatic outgrowth. Altogether, these functional networks of molecules contribute to the development of a selective environment that promotes the seeding and malignant progression of tumorigenic cells in distant organs. We include here candidate target proteins and signaling pathways that are now under clinical investigation. Although many of these trials are still ongoing, they provide the basis for the development of new aspects in the treatment of metastatic cancers, which involves inhibition of these proteins and their molecular networks.",

In addition to EBV, the development of NPC involves cumulative genetic and epigenetic changes influenced by predisposing genetic factors and environmental carcinogens.

Multiple chromosomal abnormalities (e.g. copy number changes on chromosomes 3p, 9p, 11q, 12p, and 14q), gene alterations (e.g. p16 deletion and LTBR amplification), and epigenetic changes (e.g. RASSF1A and TSLC1 methylation) have been identified by various genome-wide approaches, such as allelotyping, CGH, and microarray analysis. In this review, we will discuss the critical genetic events that contribute to the initiation and progression of NPC.

In this review, we summarize association studies conducted over the past decade to evaluate the role of genetic polymorphisms in NPC development. A review of the literature identified close to 100 studies, including 3 genome-wide association studies (GWAS), since 2000 that evaluated genetic polymorphisms and NPC risk in at least 100 NPC cases and 100 controls. Consistent evidence for associations were reported for a handful of genes, including immune-related HLA Class I genes, DNA repair gene RAD51L1, cell cycle control genes MDM2 and TP53, and cell adhesion/migration gene MMP2. However, for most of the genes evaluated, there was no effort to replicate findings and studies were largely modest in size, typically consisting of no more than a few hundred cases and controls. The small size of most studies, and the lack of attempts at replication have limited progress in understanding the genetics of NPC. Moving forward, if we are to advance our understanding of genetic factors involved in the development of NPC, and of the impact of gene\u2013gene and gene\u2013environment interations in the development of this disease, consortial efforts that pool across multiple, well-designed and coordinated efforts will most likely be required.",

     "abstract": "Like other human solid tumors, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a tissue and a systemic disease as much as a cell disease. Tumor cell population in NPC is highly heterogeneous. Heavy infiltration by non-malignant leucocytes results at least in part from the production of abundant inflammatory cytokines by the malignant epithelial cells. There is indirect evidence that interactions between stromal and malignant cells contribute to tumor development. Peripheral blood samples collected from NPC patients contain multiple products derived from the tumor, including cytokines, non-cytokine tumor proteins, tumor exosomes and viral nucleic acids. These products represent a potential source of biomarkers for assessment of tumor aggressiveness, indirect exploration of cellular interactions and monitoring of tumor response to therapeutic agents. Most NPC patients are immunocompetent with evidence of active humoral and cellular immune responses against EBV-antigens at the systemic level. Tumor development is facilitated by local immunosuppressive factors which are not fully understood. Local accumulation of regulatory T-cells is probably one important factor. At least two NPC tumor products are suspected to contribute to their expansion, the cytokine CCL20 and the tumor exosomes carrying galectin 9. In the future, new therapeutic modalities will probably aim at breaking immune tolerance or at blocking cellular interactions critical for tumor growth.",

     "abstract": "All cancers depend on stroma for support of growth. Leukemias, solid tumors, cancer cells causing effusions, metastases as well as micro-disseminated cancer cells release factors that stimulate stromal cells, which in turn produce ligands that stimulate cancer cells. Therefore, elimination of stromal support by destroying the stromal cells or by inhibiting feedback stimulation of cancer growth is in the focus of many evolving therapies. A stringent evaluation of the efficacy of stromal targeting requires testing in animal models. Most current studies emphasize the successes of stromal targeting rather than deciphering its limitations.

     "abstract": "Metastatic cancer is usually an incurable disease. Cancers have a broad repertoire of subversive tactics to defeat the immune system. They mimic self, they down-regulate MHC molecules so that T cells are blind to their presence, they interfere with antigen presentation, and they produce factors that can kill T cells or paralyze their response to antigens. Furthermore, the same powerful machinery designed to prevent harmful autoimmune responses is also acting to protect cancers. In particular, cancer is protected with the help of so-called regulatory immune cells. These unique subsets of cells, represented by almost every immune cell type, function to control responses of effector immune cells. In this review, we will discuss the evidence that cancer actively promotes cross-talk of regulatory immune cells to evade immunosurveillance. We will also discuss the role of a newly described cell type, regulatory B cells, by emphasizing their importance in suppression of antitumor immune responses. Thus, cancer not only directly suppresses immune function, but also recruits components of the immune system to become traitors and protect the tumor from immune attack.",

The investigation of therapeutic activities of tellurium compounds is rather limited in the literature, despite the relative abundance of tellurium in the human body. Nevertheless, the varied activities of tellurium agents in both malignant and normal cells are extremely exciting, though very complex. Not surprisingly, an increased interest in tellurium among biological chemists and pharmacists has fuelled the search for more and more diverse tellurium compounds.The present review will focus on two small inorganic tellurium complexes, ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-O,O\u2032)tellurate (AS101) and Octa-O-bis-(R,R)-tartarate ditellurane (SAS), thoroughly investigated by us, converging at their anti-cancer properties, and elucidating their mechanism of action. AS101 is probably the most extensively studied synthetic tellurium compound from the standpoint of its biological activity. It is a potent immunomodulator (both in vitro and in vivo) with a variety of potential therapeutic applications. It is probably the only tellurium compound to be tested in phase I/II clinical studies in cancer patients.The effects of AS101 and SAS are primarily caused by their specific Te(IV) redox-modulating activities enabling the inactivation of cysteine proteases such as cathepsin B, inhibition of specific tumor survival proteins like survivin, or obstruction of tumor IL-10 production. All of these have profound consequences regarding anti-tumor activity or sensitization of tumors to chemotherapy. These properties, coupled with the excellent safety profile of the compounds, suggest promising anti-cancer therapeutic potential for tellurium compounds such as AS101 or SAS.",

Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are the principle signaling proteins for many cytokines and growth factors, thereby play a critical role in regulating immune cell homeostasis, differentiation and cellular functions. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the field demonstrating active interactions between STATs and miRs, with our primary focus on the promotion and inhibition of immune cells and cancer. Additionally, we review the reciprocal regulations between STATs and miR, and discuss how we can use this knowledge in the context of diseases. For example, recent findings related to STAT1 and miR-155 support the presence of a positive feedback loop of miR-155 and STAT1 in response to inflammatory signals or infection. STAT3 is known to play critical roles in tumorigenesis and cancer-induced immunosuppression. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that STAT3 directly activates miR-21, one of miRs that promote cancer cell survival and proliferation. While some miRs directly regulate STATs, there are findings demonstrating indirect STAT regulation by miRs also mediate important biological mechanisms. Therefore, further research is warranted to elucidate significant contributions made by direct and indirect miR\u2013STAT mechanisms.

     "abstract": "There is mounting evidence for the existence of an important relationship between telomeres and telomerase and cellular aging and cancer. Normal human cells progressively lose telomeres with each cell division until a few short telomeres become uncapped leading to a growth arrest known as replicative aging. In the absence of genomic alterations these cells do not die but remain quiescent producing a different constellation of proteins compared to young quiescent cells. Upon specific genetic and epigenetic alterations, normal human cells bypass replicative senescence and continue to proliferate until many telomere ends become uncapped leading to a phenomenon known as crisis. In crisis cells have critically shortened telomeres but continue to attempt to divide leading to significant cell death (apoptosis) and progressive genomic instability. Rarely, a human cell escapes crisis and these cells almost universally express the ribonucleoprotein, telomerase, and maintain stable but short telomeres. The activation of telomerase may be thought of as a mechanism to slow down the rate genomic instability due to dysfunctional telomeres. While telomerase does not drive the oncogenic process, it is permissive and required for the sustain growth of most advanced cancers. Since telomerase is not expressed in most normal human cells, this has led to the development of targeted telomerase cancer therapeutic approaches that are presently in advanced clinical trials.",

In recent years, it has become increasingly apparent that the senescence response is a complex phenotype, which has a variety of cell non-autonomous effects. The senescence-associated secretory phenotype, or SASP, entails the secretion of numerous cytokines, growth factors and proteases. The SASP can have beneficial or detrimental effects, depending on the physiological context. One recently described beneficial effect is to aid tissue repair. Among the detrimental effects, the SASP can disrupt normal tissue structures and function, and, ironically, can promote malignant phenotypes in nearby cells. These detrimental effects in many ways recapitulate the degenerative and hyperplastic pathologies that develop during aging. Because the SASP is largely a response to genomic or epigenomic damage, we suggest it may be a model for a cellular damage response that can propagate damage signals both within and among tissues. We propose that both the degenerative and hyperplastic diseases of aging may be fueled by such damage signals.",

The establishment of cellular senescence can occur in response to telomere attrition associated with cell turnover and ageing or following oncogene activation. Although seemingly two distinct phenomena, cellular senescence and cancer share similarly altered global epigenetic profiles comprising changes in DNA methylation, involving global hypomethylation of repetitive DNA sequences and regional hypermethylation of some gene promoters, and in histone post-translational modifications. As epigenetic and genetic alterations are likely to act synergistically in cancer, anomalous epigenetic marks acquired during ageing or in response to oncogene activation might play important roles in tumorigenesis and cancer progression. These potentially tumor-promoting epigenetic alterations include transcriptional repression of genes encoding tumor suppressors or developmentally regulated proteins, expression of non-coding repetitive RNAs and acquisition of distinct heterochromatin marks that may contribute to suppress cell death by reducing DNA damage response.Cellular senescence may thus be viewed as a double-edged sword that, although acting as a potent anti-proliferative barrier, may pave the way to tumorigenesis in senescence-escaping cells by altering their epigenetic make up.",

     "abstract": "Data accumulating during the last two decades suggest that tumorigenesis is held in check by two major intrinsic failsafe mechanisms; apoptosis and cellular senescence. While apoptosis is a programmed cell death process, cellular senescence, which is the focus of this article, is defined as irreversible cell cycle arrest. This process is triggered either by telomere erosion or by acute stress signals including oncogenic stress induced by overactive oncogenes or underactive tumor suppressor genes. The outcome of this is often replication overload and oxidative stress resulting in DNA damage. Oncogenic stress induces at least three intrinsic pathways, p16/pRb-, Arf/p53/p21- and the DNA damage response (DDR)-pathways, that induce premature senescence if the stress exceeds a threshold level. Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is frequently observed in premalignant lesions both in animal tumor models and in human patients but is essentially absent in advanced cancers, suggesting that malignant tumor cells have found ways to bypass or escape senescence. This review focuses on cell-autonomous mechanism by which certain oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes and components of the DDR/DNA-repair machinery suppress senescence \u2013 mechanisms that are exploited by tumor cells to evade senescence and continue to multiply. In this way, tumor cells become addicted to the continuous activity of senescence suppressor proteins. However, some senescence pathways, although under suppression, may remain intact and can be re-established if senescence suppressor proteins are inactivated or if senescence inducers are reactivated. This can hopefully form the basis for a \u201cpro-senescence therapy\u201d strategy to combat cancer in the future.",

In particular, we discuss how Myc-evoked apoptosis serves as a signal for macrophage attraction and activation, followed by the secretion of TGF-\u03b2 as a cytokine that is capable of terminally arresting Myc-driven lymphoma cells without causing further DNA damage and without launching a senescence-associated, pro-inflammatory, and, therefore, potentially detrimental cytokine response in the target population.

Much work has been done to understand the mechanisms underlying such progression, but it remains unclear whether tumors progress by evasion of senescence induction, or by disruption of senescence maintenance, or whether both mechanisms can occur in human cancer development. This review presents the current evidence for mechanisms of senescence evasion and reversion, and discusses what has been learnt about this process using in vitro and in vivo experimental systems. As we learn more about the key signaling effectors of senescence, the hope is that appropriate targets will be identified for preservation and/or re-induction of senescence in human tumors.

However, other genetic aberrations are necessary for an overt lymphoma to arise. Like other B cell lymphomas, MCL at some points during the oncogenesis is dependent on interactions with other cells and factors in the microenvironment. The G protein coupled receptors cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1 and CB2) are expressed at low levels on non-malignant lymphocytes and at higher levels in MCL and other lymphoma subtypes. In this review we give an overview of what is known on the role of the cannabinoid receptors and their ligands in lymphoma as compared to non-malignant T and B lymphocytes. In MCL cannabinoids mainly reduce cell proliferation and induce cell death. Importantly, our recent findings demonstrate that cannabinoids may induce either apoptosis or another type of programmed cell death, cytoplasmic vacuolation/paraptosis in MCL. The signalling to death has been partly characterized. Even though cannabinoid receptors seem to be expressed in many other types of B cell lymphoma, the functional role of cannabinoid receptor targeting is yet largely unknown. In non-malignant B and T lymphocytes, cannabinoid receptors are up-regulated in response to antigen receptor signalling or CD40. For T lymphocytes IL-4 has also a crucial role in transcriptional regulation of CB1. In lymphocytes, cannabinoid act in several ways \u2013 by affecting cell migration, cytokine response, at high doses inhibit cell proliferation and inducing cell death. The possible role for the endocannabinoid system in the immune microenvironment of lymphoma is discussed.",

Additionally, double-hit MCL with MYC rearrangements with a highly aggressive clinical course have been reported, but no other frequent recurrent translocations have been identified. In recent years, genome-wide screening of copy number alterations by comparative genomic hybridization and genomic microarray platforms have revealed a characteristic MCL profile of multiple secondary gains and losses as well as regions of copy number neutral loss of heterozygosity that target mainly genes involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA damage response, and cell survival pathways. Several aberrations have been found to be associated with worse prognosis, 3q gains and losses of 8p, 9p, and 17p. An increased number of secondary alterations and blastoid morphology have also been shown to be associated with cases with short survival.

While patients typically respond to first-line chemotherapy, relapse is the rule resulting in a median survival of 5\u20137 years. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR appears as a key pathway in the pathogenesis and can be targeted with small molecules. Most experience is with mTOR inhibitors of the rapamycin class. Second-generation mTOR inhibitors and the PI3K inhibitor CAL-101 are novel options to more effectively target this pathway. Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition by PCI-32765 has promising activity and indicates immunoreceptor signaling as a novel therapeutic target. Up to 50% of relapsed patients respond to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib suggesting that MCL may be particularly sensitive to disruption of protein homeostasis and/or induction of oxidative stress.

Basic and translational research have provided new tools for molecular characterization of blood and tumor samples including high-throughput technologies for analysis of DNA, mRNAs, microRNAs and other non-coding RNAs, as well as proteins and epigenetic markers. Most of these studies are array-based in design. In neuroblastoma research they aim to refine risk group stratification through incorporation of molecular tumor fingerprints and also to enable personalized treatment modalities by describing the underlying pathogenesis and aberrant signaling pathways in individual tumors. To make optimal use of these new technologies for the benefit of the patient, it is crucial to have a systematic and detailed documentation of both clinical and molecular data from diagnosis through treatment to follow-up. Close collaboration between clinicians and basic scientists will provide access to combined clinical and molecular data sets and will create more efficient steps in response to the remaining treatment challenges. This review describes the current efforts and trends in neuroblastoma research from a clinical perspective in order to highlight the urgent clinical problems we must address together with basic researchers.",

     "abstract": "This review demonstrates the importance of immunobiology and immunotherapy research for understanding and treating neuroblastoma.The first suggestions of immune system\u2013neuroblastoma interactions came from in vitro experiments showing that lymphocytes from patients were cytotoxic for their own tumor cells and from evaluations of tumors from patients that showed infiltrations of immune system cells. With the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology, a number of mAbs were generated against neuroblastoma cells lines and were used to define tumor associated antigens. Disialoganglioside (GD2) is one such antigen that is highly expressed by virtually all neuroblastoma cells and so is a useful target for both identification and treatment of tumor cells with mAbs. Preclinical research using in vitro and transplantable tumor models of neuroblastoma has demonstrated that cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can specifically recognize and kill tumor cells as a result of vaccination or of genetic engineering that endows them with chimeric antigen receptors. However, CTL based clinical trials have not progressed beyond pilot and phase I studies. In contrast, anti-GD2 mAbs have been extensively studied and modified in pre-clinical experiments and have progressed from phase I through phase III clinical trials. Thus, the one proven beneficial immunotherapy for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma uses a chimeric anti-GD2 mAb combined with IL-2 and GM-CSF to treat patients after they have received intensive cyto-reductive chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgery. Ongoing pre-clinical and clinical research emphasizes vaccine, adoptive cell therapy, and mAb strategies. Recently it was shown that the neuroblastoma microenvironment is immunosuppressive and tumor growth promoting, and strategies to overcome this are being developed to enhance anti-tumor immunotherapy.Our understanding of the immunobiology of neuroblastoma has increased immensely over the past 40 years, and clinical translation has shown that mAb based immunotherapy can contribute to improving treatment for high-risk patients. Continued immunobiology and pre-clinical therapeutic research will be translated into even more effective immunotherapeutic strategies that will be integrated with new cytotoxic drug and irradiation therapies to improve survival and quality of life for patients with high-risk neuroblastoma.",

     "abstract": "Childhood neuroblastoma exhibits a heterogeneous clinical behavior ranging from low-risk tumors with the ability to spontaneously differentiate and regress, to high-risk tumors causing the highest number of cancer related deaths in infants. Amplification of the MYCN oncogene is one of the few prediction markers for adverse outcome. This gene encodes the MYCN transcriptional regulator predominantly expressed in the developing peripheral neural crest. MYCN is vital for proliferation, migration and stem cell homeostasis while decreased levels are associated with terminal neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, high-risk tumors without MYCN amplification frequently display increased c-MYC expression and/or activation of MYC signaling pathways. On the other hand, downregulation of MYCN leads to decreased proliferation and differentiation, emphasizing the importance of MYC signaling in neuroblastoma biology. Furthermore, expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkA is associated with good prognosis, the ability to differentiate and spontaneous regression while expression of the related TrkB receptor is correlated with bad prognosis and MYCN amplification. Here we discuss the role of MYCN in neuroblastoma with a special focus on the contribution of elevated MYCN signaling for an aggressive and undifferentiated phenotype as well as the potential of using MYCN as a therapeutic target.",

     "abstract": "Since the original descriptions of gain-of function mutations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), interest in the role of this receptor tyrosine kinase in neuroblastoma development and as a potential therapeutic target has escalated. As a group, the activating point mutations in full-length ALK, found in approximately 8% of all neuroblastoma tumors, are distributed evenly across different clinical stages. However, the most frequent somatic mutation, F1174L, is associated with amplification of the MYCN oncogene. This combination of features appears to confer a worse prognosis than MYCN amplification alone, suggesting a cooperative effect on neuroblastoma formation by these two proteins. Indeed, F1174L has shown more potent transforming activity in vivo than the second most common activating mutation, R1275Q, and is responsible for innate and acquired resistance to crizotinib, a clinically relevant ALK inhibitor that will soon be commercially available. These advances cast ALK as a bona fide oncoprotein in neuroblastoma and emphasize the need to understand ALK-mediated signaling in this tumor. This review addresses many of the current issues surrounding the role of ALK in normal development and neuroblastoma pathogenesis, and discusses the prospects for clinically effective targeted treatments based on ALK inhibition.",

     "abstract": "Neuroblastoma is a childhood malignancy of the sympathetic neuronal lineage. It is a rare disease, but since it is frequently diagnosed during infancy, neuroblastoma causes life-long medical follow up of those children that survive the disease. It was early recognized that a high tumor cell differentiation stage correlates to favorable clinical stage and positive clinical outcome. Today, highly differentiated tumors are surgically removed and not further treated. Cells of many established human neuroblastoma cell lines have the capacity to differentiate when stimulated properly, and these cell lines have been used as models for studying and understanding central concepts of tumor cell differentiation. One recent aspect of this issue is the observation that tumor cells can dedifferentiate and gain a stem cell-like phenotype during hypoxic conditions, which was first shown in neuroblastoma. Aberrant or blocked differentiation is a central aspect of neuroblastoma genesis. In this review we summarize known genetic and non-genetic events in neuroblastoma that might be coupled to an aberrant sympathetic neuronal differentiation and thereby indirectly influencing tumorigenesis and/or aggressive neuroblastoma behavior.",

They also called for taking the intrinsic activity of living systems and the conservation of system states into account. We compare these notions with today's systems biology, which is often a bottom-up approach from molecular dynamics to cellular behaviour.

In the present paper it is proposed that this dichotomy can be overcome if it is accepted that research on different organizational levels of the organism is necessary. The relevance of such an approach becomes much clearer using an appropriate concept of the organism. The proposed concept is called \u201corganismic systems biology\u201d and is a compilation of three related theories, which are basically in line with considerations of many other organismic thinkers. However, it is argued, that this integrated concept is able to clarify basic assumptions of organicism. The theories are: the systems approach of Paul Weiss, the developmental systems theory and the theory of increasing autonomy in evolution. The hypothesis is that the different levels of organismic functions, which are described by these theories, are necessarily interrelated, thus generating the autonomy of the organism. This principle of interrelation needs to be regarded in scientific reasoning and can be crucial for solving many medical problems.",

Almost parallel to his findings, the science of complex systems was founded based on observations on physical and chemical systems showing that inanimate matter can exhibit complex structures although their interacting parts follow simple rules. This is explained by a process known as self-organization and it is now widely accepted that multi-cellular biological organisms are themselves self-organizing complex systems in which the relations among their parts are dynamic, contextual and interdependent. In order to fully understand such systems, we are required to computationally and mathematically model their interactions as promulgated in systems biology. The preponderance of network models in the practice of systems biology inspired by a reductionist, bottom-up view, seems to neglect, however, the importance of bidirectional interactions across spatial scales and domains. This approach introduces a shortcoming that may hinder research on emergent phenomena such as those of tissue morphogenesis and related diseases, such as cancer. Another hindrance of current modeling attempts is that those systems operate in a parameter space that seems far removed from biological reality. This misperception calls for more tightly coupled mathematical and computational models to biological experiments by creating and designing biological model systems that are accessible to a wide range of experimental manipulations. In this way, a comprehensive understanding of fundamental processes in normal development or of aberrations, like cancer, will be generated.",

Thus, tissues, and not individual cells, are the proper level of observation for the study of carcinogenesis. This paradigm shift from a reductionist approach to a systems biology approach is long overdue. Indeed, cell phenotypes are emergent modes arising through collective non-linear interactions among different cellular and microenvironmental components, generally described by \u201cphase space diagrams\u201d, where stable states (attractors) are embedded into a landscape model. Within this framework, cell states and cell transitions are generally conceived as mainly specified by gene-regulatory networks. However, the system's dynamics is not reducible to the integrated functioning of the genome\u2013proteome network alone; the epithelia\u2013stroma interacting system must be taken into consideration in order to give a more comprehensive picture. Given that cell shape represents the spatial geometric configuration acquired as a result of the integrated set of cellular and environmental cues, we posit that fractal-shape parameters represent \u201comics\u201d descriptors of the epithelium\u2013stroma system.

One such integrative concept, derived from first principles of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, is that cancerous cell states are attractor states, just like normal cell types are. Here we extend the concept of cancer attractors to illuminate a more profound property of cancer initiation: its inherent inevitability in the light of metazoan evolution. Using Waddington's Epigenetic Landscape as a conceptual aid, for which we present a mathematical and evolutionary foundation, we propose that cancer is intrinsically linked to ontogenesis and phylogenesis.

Dishes seeded with NIH3T3 were then placed on top of those seeded with HMVECad at distances of 4\u00a0mm and 11\u00a0mm. A black filter was placed between dishes containing the two cell populations in another experiment, to prevent transmission of electromagnetic radiation between the two.

     "abstract": "This review describes a new vision for future directions in the study of metastatic cancer biology and pathology. It is based upon clinical and experimental observations on the constituent cell lineages within a neoplasm and on tumour-host interactions. The vision incorporates information from studies in population biology, developmental biology and experimental pathology as well as investigations upon human malignant disease. The assembled information reveals that invasion and metastasis are supra-cellular manifestations of \u201cemergent behavior\u201d among combinations of normal and malignant cell lineages in vivo. Emergent behavior is a combinatorial interactive process in which a population displays new traits which cannot be achieved by individuals acting separately and which subside when the specific population mix disaggregates. Disruption of such pathological interactions in the field of a developing primary or secondary tumour is, therefore, required to disable the malignant population and arrest progression without tissue destruction. These conclusions originate, in part, from principles which govern the sociobiology and group behavior of bees, ants, fish, birds and human societies. In all these social organisms, external factors can disrupt signaling mechanisms and induce expanding self-perpetuating rogue behavior, leading to social disintegration. These principles also apply to cellular societies composing higher animals, which likewise need intrinsic rules to maintain social order and avoid anarchy, and recognition of this is essential for advancing future research on the mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis and metastasis. Summarised evidence is presented here to support the conclusion that miscommunications between cells and tissues in the region of the developing tumour and its metastases are the main direct perpetrators of malignant disease. Genetic lesions (mutations, deletions, translocations, reduplications, etc.), commonly seen in cancers, can significantly disrupt important molecular pathways in the networks of communications needed to sustain orderly tissue/organ structure and function. However, genetic lesions can also, themselves, be induced by abnormal cell interactions initiated by extrinsic carcinogenic agents such as chemicals, viruses, hormones and radiation. The evidence shows that, irrespective of the initiating cause, it is this miscommunication in the region of a developing tumour and its metastases that is ultimately responsible for the emergence and progression of the disease. The article describes how this information collectively, provides a framework for designing specific novel therapeutic approaches targeting the cell and tissue interactions driving tumour metastasis and its manifold effects on the whole body.",

     "abstract": "The molecular changes associated with the transition of melanoma cells from radial growth phase (RGP) to vertical growth phase (VGP) and the metastatic phenotype are not very well defined. However, some of the genes involved in this process and their transcriptional regulation are beginning to be elucidated. For example, the switch from RGP to VGP and the metastatic phenotype is associated with loss of the AP-2\u03b1 transcription factor. AP-2\u03b1 regulates the expression of c-KIT, MMP-2, VEGF, and the adhesion molecule MCAM/MUC18. Recently, we reported that AP-2\u03b1 also regulates two G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) PAR-1 and PAFR. In turn, the thrombin receptor, PAR-1, regulates the expression of the gap junction protein Connexin-43 and the tumor suppressor gene Maspin. Activation of PAR-1 also leads to overexpression and secretion of proangiogenic factors such as IL-8, uPA, VEGF, PDGF, as well certain integrins. PAR-1 also cooperates with PAFR to regulate the expression of the MCAM/MUC18 via phosphorylation of CREB. The ligands for these GPCRs, thrombin and PAF, are secreted by stromal cells, emphasizing the importance of the tumor microenvironment in melanoma metastasis. The metastatic phenotype of melanoma is also associated with overexpression and function of CREB/ATF-1. Loss of AP-2\u03b1 and overexpression of CREB/ATF-1 results in the overexpression of MCAM/MUC18 which by itself contributes to melanoma metastasis by regulating the inhibitor of DNA binding-1 (Id-1). CREB/ATF-1 also regulates the angiogenic factor CYR-61. Our recent data indicate that CREB/ATF-1 regulates the expression of AP-2\u03b1, thus, supporting the notion that CREB is an important \u201cmaster switch\u201d in melanoma progression.",

Thus, the shear stress caused by the blood flow may physically damage tumor cells during their translocation from primary tumors to distant organs via the circulation. In addition, the tissue microenvironment of distant organs is generally unfamiliar to tumor cells, limiting their proliferation within the parenchyma of these organs. Each of these situations involves various types of interactions between tumor cells and host components, which either support or inhibit the establishment and subsequent progression of metastases. The initial formation of micrometastases, as well as their subsequent growth \u2013 often termed colonization \u2013 therefore require complex adaptations by tumor cells to various host components, most of which are never encountered by these cells during their growth within primary tumor sites. These difficulties explain why the colonization of distant organs by disseminated tumor cells is an extraordinarily demanding task and thus inefficient, and suggests a number of potential targets that might be used in the future to interfere therapeutically with this process.

The development of a relevant mouse model for the establishment and growth of brain metastasis has advanced our understanding of the biology and therapy of this most feared consequence of cancer. Injection of murine or human tumor cells into the internal carotid artery of mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain that are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumor cells to exploit homeostatic mechanisms and proliferate. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses demonstrate that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in brains of mice or in clinical specimen of human lung cancer brain metastases is lower than that in the adjacent tumor-free brain parenchyma. However, brain metastasis-associated blood vessels are dilated and contain numerous dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumor cells located less than 100\u00a0\u03bcm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumor cells undergo apoptosis. Tumor cells within brain metastasis produce VEGF which induces permeability in adjacent vessels. The BBB in metastases that are larger than 0.25\u00a0mm in diameter is leaky. Metastases in the brain are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs.The venerable \u201cseed and soil\u201d hypothesis suggests that the outcome of metastasis depends on the interaction between unique tumor cells and the specific organ microenvironment. The demonstration that activated astrocytes whose physiological role is to protect neurons from toxic substances can be exploited by tumor cells for protection from chemotherapeutic drugs suggests new approaches to the treatment of this fatal disease.",

As a result of the present limitations in treating CNS metastases, this manifestation of tumor progression remains an unmet clinical need. Despite its significance, our general understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the brain-metastatic phenotype is currently meager.

     "abstract": "The infiltration of tumors and their metastases by hematopoietic cells can contribute both positively and negatively to tumor growth, invasion, and patient outcomes. These differing outcomes are associated with both tumor heterogeneity and the diversity of leukocytes infiltrating neoplastic lesions. Tumors infiltration by histiocytes (macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs)) is associated with poor clinical outcomes, although infiltration by a subset of DCs is related to improved outcomes. T-cell infiltration of tumors and metastases are surrogates for positive outcomes, although subset analysis suggests that not all infiltrating T-cells have this potential. Overall, tumor infiltration by CD8+ T-cells is associated with a positive outcome, while the frequency of infiltrating CD4+ cells may be a negative predictor. In addition to tumor infiltration by macrophages and T-cells, recent studies have shown that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), also infiltrate tumors, inhibiting T-cell and DC number and function and facilitate tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis. In summary, hematopoietic cell infiltration of tumors can regulate tumor progression and provide a useful diagnostic surrogate. Further, strategies focused on the manipulation of cellular infiltration via cellular, gene and molecular immunotherapies have the potential to provide a novel target for adjuvant therapy.",

The recent development of new techniques for the investigations of global change in the gene expression, signaling pathways and wide genome binding has provided novel information for the mechanisms underlying liver cancer progression.

The development of HCC is a multistep process which includes the progressive alterations of gene expression leading to the increased proliferation and to liver cancer. This review summarizes recent progress in the identification of the key steps of the development of HCC with the focus on early events of carcinogenesis and on the role of translational and epigenetic alterations in the development of HCC. Quiescent stage of the liver is supported by several tumor suppressor proteins including p53, Rb and C/EBP\u03b1. Studies with chemical models of liver carcinogenesis and with human HCC have shown that the elevation of gankyrin is responsible for the elimination of these three proteins at early steps of carcinogenesis. Later stages of progression of the liver cancer are associated with alterations in many signaling pathways including translation which leads to epigenetic silencing/activation of many genes. Particularly, recent reports suggest a critical role of histone deacetylase 1, HDAC1, in the development of HCC through the interactions with transcription factors such as C/EBP family proteins.",

     "abstract": "Among the adult organs, liver is unique for its ability to regenerate. A concerted signaling cascade enables optimum initiation of the regeneration process following insults brought about by surgery or a toxicant. Additionally, there exists a cellular redundancy, whereby a transiently amplifying progenitor population appears and expands to ensure regeneration, when differentiated cells of the liver are unable to proliferate in both experimental and clinical scenarios. One such pathway of relevance in these phenomena is Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, which is activated relatively early during regeneration mostly through post-translational modifications. Once activated, \u03b2-catenin signaling drives the expression of target genes that are critical for cell cycle progression and contribute to initiation of the regeneration process. The role and regulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is now documented in rats, mice, zebrafish and patients. More recently, a regenerative advantage of the livers in \u03b2-catenin overexpressing mice was reported, as was also the case after exogenous Wnt-1 delivery to the liver paving the way for assessing means to stimulate the pathway for therapeutics in liver failure. \u03b2-Catenin is also pertinent in hepatic oval cell activation and differentiation. However, aberrant activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is reported in a significant subset of hepatocellular cancers (HCC). While many mechanisms of such activation have been reported, the most functional means of aberrant and sustained activation is through mutations in the \u03b2-catenin gene or in AXIN1/2, which encodes for a scaffolding protein critical for \u03b2-catenin degradation. Intriguingly, in experimental models hepatic overexpression of normal or mutant \u03b2-catenin is insufficient for tumorigenesis. In fact \u03b2-catenin loss promoted chemical carcinogenesis in the liver due to alternate mechanisms. Since most HCC occur in the backdrop of chronic hepatic injury, where hepatic regeneration is necessary for maintenance of liver function, but at the same time serves as the basis of dysplastic changes, this Promethean attribute exhibits a Jekyll and Hyde behavior that makes distinguishing good regeneration from bad regeneration essential for targeting selective molecular pathways as personalized medicine becomes a norm in clinical practice. Could \u03b2-catenin signaling be one such pathway that may be redundant in regeneration and indispensible in HCC in a subset of cases?",

     "abstract": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), an incurable disease of the elderly, stands out as unique among the malignancies derived from mature B lymphocytes. The histology, immunophenotype, immunoglobulin variable region (IgV) gene somatic hypermutation status, and the pattern of genetic alterations of the tumor cells are markedly distinct from that of any other B-cell tumor. Most notably, CLL cases can have somatically mutated as well as unmutated IgV genes which largely correlate with a favorable and unfavorable clinical prognosis, respectively. Moreover, recent evidence suggests that 6% of the normal elderly population develops a monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) that appears as the precursor to CLL in 1\u20132% of cases. Over the last decade, global gene expression profile analysis was instrumental in defining CLL as a malignancy originating from the oncogenic transformation of a common cellular precursor that resembles an antigen-experienced B cell. These findings were complemented by the realization that all CLL, independent of their IgV gene somatic mutation status, express B-cell receptors (BCRs) that show evidence of antigen-experience. Indeed, the BCRs of CLL cases among different individuals can be similar to the extent that one was able to define subsets of stereotyped receptors based on the homology in the antigen-binding regions. Together, these observations strongly support the notion that antigen plays a critical role in CLL pathogenesis. This role is complemented by genetic alterations that, analogous to most cancer types, represent the initiating pathogenetic event. In fact, CLL cases display recurrent genetic aberrations including trisomy 12 and monoallelic or biallelic deletion/inactivation of chromosomal regions 17p, 11q and 13q14. However, virtually all CLL cases lack balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocations, the genetic hallmark of germinal center (GC)-derived lymphomas. The most frequent genetic aberration in CLL, deletion of chromosomal region 13q14, was recently shown to have a specific role in CLL pathogenesis. This region encodes a tumor suppressor locus comprising a microRNA cluster embedded in a long sterile RNA gene, whose deletion in the mouse leads to lymphoproliferative syndromes recapitulating the human CLL-associated spectrum, including MBL, CLL and B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL). This review will focus on the cellular origin of CLL, its relationship to the mechanisms of generating CLL-associated genetic lesions and on the role of the 13q14 deletion in CLL pathogenesis as emerging from the analysis of a newly generated mouse model.",

Along with the improvement of laboratory techniques and the widespread availability of multiparameter flow cytometry, the finding of tiny aberrant B-cell populations became more frequent, prompting the need for clinical and biological definition of the nature of this condition and its relationship with leukemia development. MBL seems to be a melting-pot containing several entities, identical in terms of phenotype but with extremely different risks of leukemia development (from low to none) that seem to correlate with the number of B lymphocytes. CLL-like MBL observed in the clinical setting (\u201cClinical MBL\u201d), usually being characterized by lymphocytosis, demonstrated a sizeable, even if low (1.1\u20131.4% per year), risk of leukemic progression, but represents a minority of all MBL cases. The vast majority of CLL-like MBL are detected in general population screenings and do not likely have a risk of CLL that is substantially higher than that of unaffected individuals. Interestingly, MBL frequency increases with age, being virtually undetectable under 40 years of age but being present in 50\u201375% of the people older than 90 years. It has been proposed that MBL could be interpreted as an epiphenomenon of a chronic and persistent antigenic stimulation. The (rare) possibility to evolve into a frank leukemia might then depend on biological and molecular factors insofar unknown that may modify the modality of cell reaction as well as the potential to acquire further genetic abnormalities. Therefore, the real challenge of the next years in the MBL research field is not to increase the sensitivity of detection, neither to implement screening protocols to be applied to the general population, rather to unravel the biologic features that, at individual level, will identify those (few) cases that are at risk of developing a progressive disease.",

During B-cell maturation, sIg accumulates somatic mutations in the Ig variable region (V) genes and tumours retain these patterns, thereby revealing the point of differentiation of the B cell of origin. The importance of origin is strikingly illustrated in CLL where the two major subsets with distinctive clinical behaviour express either unmutated (U) or mutated (M) V genes. Biased selection of VDJ genes also occurs in CLL, allowing further identification of the normal B-cell counterparts, with U-CLL apparently derived from circulating na\u00efve B cells. Surface IgM of CLL is functional, with evidence for ongoing interaction with antigen in vivo. Signalling connects to cell survival, proliferation and migration, key determinants of tumour cell behaviour. Probing of B-cell receptor-mediated signalling pathways, either constitutively activated or open for activation, reveals dynamic, possibly repetitive, stimulatory events, likely to occur in tissue sites. Subtle differences in signal responsiveness between U-CLL or M-CLL subsets, together with microenvironmental factors, may explain clinical outcome. Knowledge of the critical signalling pathways should reveal the steps vulnerable to inhibition and allow development of a new range of therapeutic drugs, targeted particularly against the more aggressive subset, U-CLL.",

This is due to a restricted EBV encoded protein expression in the CLL cells, they express EBNAs, the virus encoded proteins that are localized in the nucleus, but not the cell membrane associated LMP-1, that is also pivotal for the virus induced transformation of B lymphocytes. This expression pattern seems to be unique to a defined B cell maturation window that is represented by the CLL cells. We named this restricted viral expression as Type IIb. Such B lymphocytes have been encountered in lymphoid tissues of infectious mononucleosis (IM) and in post transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Moreover, they were shown in tissues of EBV infected \u201chumanized\u201d mice.The EBV encoded protein expression pattern may serve as a marker for the B cell differentiation stage from which CLL clones can develop.",

     "abstract": "CLL is characterized by a dynamic balance between cells proliferating in the lymphoid organs and circulating cells resisting programmed cell death. Regulating this equilibrium entails complex interactions between tumor and host, modulated by a set of surface molecules expressed by the CLL cell according to environmental conditions. The result is a constantly shifting pattern of resistance, apoptosis and proliferation. The CD38 surface molecule is an independent negative prognostic factor expressed by approximately one-third of CLL patients. Our view is that CD38 is crucial to tumor\u2013host communication and that its signals are detrimental to clinical outcome. CD38+ CLL cells can proliferate in vitro in the presence of anti-CD38 mAbs and IL-2 and are more sensitive to the effects of the CXCL12 chemokine. Blockage of CD38 signals impairs CLL cell movement from blood to lymphoid organs, as confirmed using animal models. One model to be explored considers CD38 a key component of the CLL invadosome, a still hypothetical membrane domain containing adhesion molecules, chemokine receptors and matrix metalloproteases. Some components of the invadosome are genetically polymorphic, explaining heterogeneity in functional response. The CD38 gene shows genetic differences in the promoter region, some of which represent an independent risk for Richter transformation. In addition to driving the clinical outcome of the disease, CD38 is thus an excellent candidate therapeutic target for a significant subset of CLL patients.",

Such markers of cell lineage can be used to identify the abnormal proliferative signature of neoplastic clonal evolution, even at a stage which predates morphologically recognizable dysplasia.

     "abstract": "Cancer development requires multiple oncogenic mutations. Pathogenic mechanisms which accelerate this process may be favored carcinogenic pathways. Mutator mutations are mutations in genetic stability genes, and increase the mutation rate, speeding up the accumulation of oncogenic mutations. The mutator hypothesis states that mutator mutations play a critical role in carcinogenesis. Alternatively, tumors might arise by mutations occurring at the normal rate followed by selection and expansion of various premalignant lineages on the path to cancer. This alternative pathway is a significant argument against the mutator hypothesis. Mutator mutations may also lead to accumulation of deleterious mutations, which could lead to extinction of premalignant lineages before they become cancerous, another argument against the mutator hypothesis. Finally, the need for acquisition of a mutator mutation imposes an additional step on the carcinogenic process. Accordingly, the mutator hypothesis has been a seminal but controversial idea for several decades despite considerable experimental and theoretical work. To resolve this debate, the concept of efficiency has been introduced as a metric for comparing carcinogenic mechanisms, and a new theoretical approach of focused quantitative modeling has been applied. The results demonstrate that, given what is already known, the predominance of mutator mechanisms is likely inevitable, as they overwhelm less efficient non-mutator pathways to cancer.",

In order to accumulate large numbers of mutations, we have proposed that cancers express a mutator phenotype. Similar to cancer cells, many viral populations, by replicating their genomes with low fidelity, carry a substantial mutational load. As high levels of mutation are potentially deleterious, the viral mutation frequency is thresholded at a level below which viral populations equilibrate in a traditional mutation-selection balance, and above which the population is no longer viable, i.e., the population undergoes an error catastrophe. Because their mutation frequencies are fine-tuned just below this error threshold, viral populations are susceptible to further increases in mutational load and, recently this phenomenon has been exploited therapeutically by a concept that has been termed lethal mutagenesis. Here we review the application of lethal mutagenesis to the treatment of HIV and discuss how lethal mutagenesis may represent a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid cancers.",

TEs also have the potential to generate a wide range of mutations derivation of which is difficult to directly trace to mobile elements, including double strand breaks that may trigger mutagenic genomic rearrangements. Genome-wide hypomethylation of TE promoters and significantly elevated TE expression in almost all human cancers often accompanied by the loss of critical DNA sensing and repair pathways suggests that the negative impact of mobile elements on genome stability should increase as human tumors evolve. The biological consequences of elevated retroelement expression, such as the rate of their amplification, in human cancers remain obscure, particularly, how this increase translates into disease-relevant mutations.

     "abstract": "It is now commonly agreed that the human genome is not the stable entity originally presumed. Deletions, duplications, inversions, and insertions are common, and contribute significantly to genomic structural variations (SVs). Their collective impact generates much of the inter-individual genomic diversity observed among humans. Not only do these variations change the structure of the genome; they may also have functional implications, e.g. altered gene expression. Some SVs have been identified as the cause of genetic disorders, including cancer predisposition. Cancer cells are notorious for their genomic instability, and often show genomic rearrangements at the microscopic and submicroscopic level to which transposable elements (TEs) contribute. Here, we review the role of TEs in genome instability, with particular focus on non-LTR retrotransposons. Currently, three non-LTR retrotransposon families \u2013 long interspersed element 1 (L1), SVA (short interspersed element (SINE-R), variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR), and Alu), and Alu (a SINE) elements \u2013 mobilize in the human genome, and cause genomic instability through both insertion- and post-insertion-based mutagenesis. Due to the abundance and high sequence identity of TEs, they frequently mislead the homologous recombination repair pathway into non-allelic homologous recombination, causing deletions, duplications, and inversions. While less comprehensively studied, non-LTR retrotransposon insertions and TE-mediated rearrangements are probably more common in cancer cells than in healthy tissue. This may be at least partially attributed to the commonly seen global hypomethylation as well as general epigenetic dysfunction of cancer cells. Where possible, we provide examples that impact cancer predisposition and/or development.",

The characterization of a considerable number of rearrangement breakpoints has now been accomplished at the nucleotide sequence level, thereby providing an invaluable resource for the detailed study of the mutational mechanisms which underlie genomic recombination events. A better understanding of these mutational mechanisms is vital for improving the design of mutation detection strategies. At least five categories of mutational mechanism are known to give rise to genomic rearrangements: (i) homologous recombination including non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR), gene conversion, single strand annealing (SSA) and break-induced replication (BIR), (ii) non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), (iii) microhomology-mediated replication-dependent recombination (MMRDR), (iv) long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1)-mediated retrotransposition and (v) telomere healing. Focussing on the first three of these general mechanisms, we compare and contrast their hallmark characteristics, and discuss the role of various local DNA sequence features (e.g. recombination-promoting motifs, repetitive sequences and sequences capable of non-B DNA formation) in mediating the recombination events that underlie gross genomic rearrangements.

Selection by the environment encountered in the patient may support the preferential survival of clones with insertional deregulation of genes that are involved in the control of engraftment, proliferation or differentiation, in the worst case initiating oncogenic progression. Rapid scientific and technological progress has shed much light onto this dark side of untargeted vector integration. New approaches to unbiased and highly sensitive \u201cintegromics\u201d promise a precise documentation of stable polyclonality, clonal fluctuation or clonal imbalance of gene-modified cell populations.

     "abstract": "Primary human tumours can often be eradicated by surgery if detected early; however metastatic disease renders complete cure less likely and the development of resistance to therapy results in tumour escape and increased risk of death. Interactions of tumour cells with each other, surrounding normal cells and extracellular matrix or basement membrane components are crucial to all stages of cancer progression. Changes in both cell\u2013cell and cell\u2013substrate proteins are linked to tumour cell migratory and invasive ability, induction of angiogenesis (on which sustained tumour growth and dissemination depends) and apoptosis resistance in response to drugs or radiotherapy. Hypoxia within solid tumours is a key driver of many aspects of progression, and may also nurture cancer stem-like cells which are increasingly linked to relapse and treatment failure. This review will briefly outline the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying tumour progression, focussing on the acquisition of metastatic capacity and resistance to therapy.",

     "abstract": "Tumor progression in vitro has traditionally been studied in the context of two-dimensional (2D) environments. However, it is now well accepted that 2D substrates are unnaturally rigid compared to the physiological substrate known as extracellular matrix (ECM) that is in direct contact with both normal and tumorigenic cells in vivo. Hence, the patterns of interactions, as well as the strategies used by cells in order to penetrate the ECM, and migrate through a three-dimensional (3D) environment are notoriously different than those observed in 2D. Several substrates, such as collagen I, laminin, or complex mixtures of ECM components have been used as surrogates of native 3D ECM to more accurately study cancer cell behaviors. In addition, 3D matrices developed from normal or tumor-associated fibroblasts have been produced to recapitulate the mesenchymal 3D environment that assorted cells encounter in vivo. Some of these substrates are being used to evaluate physico-mechanical effects on tumor cell behavior. Physiological 3D ECMs exhibit a wide range of rigidities amongst different tissues while the degree of stromal stiffness is known to change during tumorigenesis. In this review we describe some of the physico-mechanical characteristics of tumor-associated ECMs believed to play important roles in regulating epithelial tumorigenic behaviors.",

In \u201czooming in\u201d on this process, cancer biologists have focused their attention on the molecular and cellular manifestations of the \u201ctransformed phenotype\u201d, including the genomic instability of cancer cells, their deregulated transcriptional activity, their aberrant morphology and dynamics, and the altered signaling networks activated in them. Attempts to elucidate the mechanisms underlying malignant and metastatic transformation are primarily motivated by the desire to identify specific molecules and signaling pathways that can serve as targets for novel therapies.In recent years, such studies were reinforced by major technological and conceptual developments: novel and powerful tools for genomic and proteomic analysis have been developed, and advanced computational approaches offer \u201csystems-level\u201d integration of rich and complex biological datasets into meaningful functional networks.

     "abstract": "Heparanase is an endo-\u03b2-glucuronidase that cleaves heparan sulfate side chains presumably at sites of low sulfation, activity that is strongly implicated with cell invasion associated with cancer metastasis, a consequence of structural modification that loosens the extracellular matrix barrier. In addition, heparanase exerts pro-adhesive properties, mediated by clustering of membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans (i.e., syndecans) and activation of signaling molecules such as Akt, Src, EGFR, and Rac in a heparan sulfate-dependent and -independent manner. Activation of signaling cascades by enzymatically inactive heparanase and by a peptide corresponding to its substrate binding domain not only increases cell adhesion but also facilitates cancer cell growth. This notion is supported by preclinical and clinical settings, encouraging the development of anti-heparanase therapeutics. Here, we summarize recent progress in heparanase research emphasizing the molecular mechanisms that govern its pro-tumorigenic and pro-adhesive properties. Pro-adhesive properties of the heparanase homolog, heparanase 2 (Hpa2), are also discussed. Enzymatic activity-independent function of proteases (i.e., matrix metalloproteinases) is discussed in the context of cell adhesion and tumor progression. Collectively, these examples suggest that enzyme function exceeds beyond the enzymatic aspect, thus significantly expanding the scope of the functional proteome. Cross-talk with matrix metalloproteinases and the role of heparanase in pathological settings other than cancer are also described.",

Regulation of cell\u2013cell (intercellular) and cell\u2013matrix adhesion is tightly controlled in normal cells, however, defects in cell adhesion are common in the majority of human cancers. Multilateral communication among tumor cells with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and neighbor cells is accomplished through adhesion molecules, ECM components, proteolytic enzymes and their endogenous inhibitors. There is sufficient evidence to suggest that reduced adherence is a tumor cell property engaged during tumor progression. Tumor cells acquire the ability to change shape, detach and easily move through spaces disorganizing the normal tissue architecture. This property is due to changes in expression levels of adhesion molecules and/or due to elevated levels of secreted proteolytic enzymes, including matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Among other roles, MMPs degrade the ECM and, therefore, prepare the path for tumor cells to migrate, invade and spread to distant secondary areas, where they form metastasis. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases or TIMPs control MMP activities and, therefore, minimize matrix degradation. Both MMPs and TIMPs are involved in tissue remodeling and decisively regulate tumor cell progression including tumor angiogenesis.

     "abstract": "Cancer metastasis is facilitated by cell\u2013cell interactions between cancer cells and endothelial cells in distant tissues. In addition, cancer cell interactions with platelets and leukocytes contribute to cancer cell adhesion, extravasation, and the establishment of metastatic lesions. Selectins are carbohydrate-binding molecules that bind to sialylated, fucosylated glycan structures, and are found on endothelial cells, platelets and leukocytes. There are three members of the selectin family: P-selectin expressed on activated platelets and endothelial cells, L-selectin present on leukocytes and E-selectin expressed on activated endothelial cells. Besides the accepted roles of selectins in physiological processes, such as inflammation, immune response and hemostasis, there is accumulating evidence for the potential of selectins to contribute to a number of pathophysiological processes, including cancer metastasis. Cancer cell interactions with selectins are possible due to a frequent presence of carbohydrate determinants\u2014selectin ligands on the cell surface of tumor cells from various type of cancer. The degree of selectin ligand expression by cancer cells is well correlated with metastasis and poor prognosis for cancer patients. Initial adhesion events of cancer cells facilitated by selectins result in activation of integrins, release of chemokines and are possibly associated with the formation of permissive metastatic microenvironment. While E-selectin has been evaluated as one of the initiating adhesion events during metastasis, it is becoming apparent that P-selectin and L-selectin-mediated interactions significantly contribute to this process as well. In this review we discuss the current evidence for selectins as potential facilitators of metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Poor prognosis of acute leukemia with current treatments is mainly due to the relapse of the disease following chemotherapy. In the last decade, an emerging concept has proposed that the leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and their interactions with the BM microenvironment are the major cause of the acute leukemia relapse. Adhesion to the stromal niche is crucial for LSCs as it directly supports self-renewal, proliferation, arrest of differentiation and protects from damaging chemo-agents. One of the key players in this crosstalk between leukemic cells and the BM stroma niche is the chemokine SDF-1. SDF-1 regulates the process of homing and engraftment of LSCs into the BM and inhibition of its receptor CXCR4 induces leukemic cell mobilization into the circulation. However, besides its chemotactic and adhesive functions, SDF-1 is also a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates leukemic cell proliferation as well as their program of differentiation. CXCR4 antagonists are used in combination with chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical studies, which demonstrate that blocking CXCR4 is a novel promising approach of therapy. In this review, we focus on the multifaceted SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in acute leukemia and discuss how targeting this pathway could provide potential interest to eradicate the LSCs.",

As a common presentation of the disease, the malignant plasma cells accumulate and proliferate in the bone marrow, where they disrupt normal hematopoiesis and bone physiology. Multiple myeloma cells and the bone marrow microenvironment are linked by a composite network of interactions mediated by soluble factors and adhesion molecules. Integrins and syndecan-1/CD138 are the principal multiple myeloma receptor systems of extracellular matrix components, as well as of surface molecules of stromal cells. CD44 and RHAMM are the major hyaluronan receptors of multiple myeloma cells. The SDF-1/CXCR4 axis is a key factor in the homing of multiple myeloma cells to the bone marrow. The levels of expression and activity of these adhesion molecules are controlled by cytoplasmic operating mechanisms, as well as by extracellular factors including enzymes, growth factors and microenvironmental conditions. Several signaling responses are activated by adhesive interactions of multiple myeloma cells, and their outcomes affect the survival, proliferation and migration of these cells, and in many cases generate a drug-resistant phenotype. Hence, the adhesion systems of multiple myeloma cells are attractive potential therapeutic targets. Several approaches are being developed to disrupt the activities of adhesion molecules in multiple myeloma cells, including small antagonist molecules, direct targeting by immunoconjugates, stimulation of immune responses against these molecules, and signal transduction inhibitors. These potential novel therapeutics may be incorporated into current treatment schemes, or directed against minimal residual malignant cells during remission.",

Due to their extended life span, stem cells would represent the most likely target for the accumulation of these genetic events but this has not been formally proven for most of solid cancers. Even more importantly, cancer stem cells seem to harbor mechanisms protecting them from standard cytotoxic therapy. While cancer stem cells have been demonstrated to be responsible for therapy resistance in glioblastoma and pancreatic cancer, further evidence now points to similar mechanisms in colon cancer stem cells. Therefore, it appears reasonable to conclude that there is sufficient evidence now for the existence of cancer stem cells in several epithelial tumors and that these cancer stem cells pose a significant threat via their resistance to standard therapies. Accumulating evidence suggests, however, that novel approaches targeting cancer stem cells are capable of overcoming these resistance mechanisms. To further foster our understanding of in vivo cancer stem cell biology, novel imaging modalities in conjunction with clinically most relevant cancer stem cell models need to be developed and utilized. These studies will then pave the way to better elucidate the underlying regulatory mechanisms of cancer stem cells and develop platforms for targeted theragnostics, which may eventually help improving the prognosis of our patients suffering from these deadly diseases.",

Animal models provide a means to determine the identity of the cell-of-origin leading to malignancy and to develop new treatments.

In this way cancer, reprogramming and cellular plasticity are tightly intertwined, since only some cells posses the necessary plasticity so as to allow the tumoral reprogramming to take place, and only some oncogenes have, in the right cellular context, the required tumoral reprogramming capacity.

     "abstract": "Despite continuous improvements in cancer management, locoregional recurrence or metastatic spread still occurs in a high proportion of patients after radiotherapy or combined treatments. One underlying reason might be a low efficacy of current treatments on eradication of cancer stem cells (CSCs). It has been recognised for a long time, that only the small subpopulation of CSCs can cause recurrences and that all CSCs need to be killed for permanent tumour cure. However, only recently novel technologies have allowed to enrich CSCs and to investigate their biology. An emerging experimental and clinical database provides first hints that cell populations accumulated by putative stem cell markers or tumours that highly express such markers may be more radioresistant than their marker-negative counterparts. Other data support a higher tolerance of CSCs to hypoxia and preferential location in specific microenvironmental niches. However, conflicting data, methodological problems of the assays and a generally small database on only few tumour types necessitate further large and well-designed prospective experimental and clinical investigations that specifically address this question to corroborate this hypothesis. If such investigations confirm biological differences between CSCs and non-CSCs, this would imply that novel treatment strategies need to be tested specifically for their effect on CSCs. Another implication is that also biomarkers for prediction of local tumour control after radiotherapy or combined treatments need to reflect the behaviour of CSCs and not of the bulk of all cancer cells. This review discusses the importance of CSCs for treatment failure and challenges occurring from the CSC concept for cancer diagnosis, treatment and prediction of outcome. It is concluded that CSC-based endpoints and biomarkers are eventually expected to considerably improve tumour cure rates in the clinics through individualised tailoring of treatment.",

However, many of these strategies are nonselective and genotoxic. The emerging understanding of the pathways that regulate p53 has led to the notion that it should be possible to activate the p53 pathway in ways that are inherently nongenotoxic. Important targets for pharmacological interference in this respect are MDM2 and MDMX, key negative regulators of p53. Genetic and pharmacologic studies suggest that blocking the physical interaction of these proteins with p53, or inhibiting the catalytic role of MDM2 in tagging p53 for proteasomal degradation, both of which lead to an increase in the transcriptional activity of p53, may indeed be an efficient and safe way to eradicate tumour cells that retain wild-type p53. Here we review the rationale for such strategies, as well as the current state in the discovery and development of drugs that reactivate p53 by inhibiting its inhibitors MDM2 and MDMX.

     "abstract": "The p53 tumour suppressor is a tightly controlled transcription factor that coordinates a broad programme of gene expression in response to various cellular stresses leading to the outcomes of growth arrest, senescence, or apoptosis. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a key role in maintaining p53 at critical physiological levels by targeting it for proteasome-mediated degradation. Expression of the MDM2 gene is p53-dependent and thus p53 and MDM2 operate within a negative feedback loop in which p53 controls the levels of its own regulator. Induction and activation of p53 involves mainly the uncoupling of p53 from its negative regulators, principally MDM2 and MDMX, an MDM2-related and -interacting protein that inhibits p53 transactivation function. MDM2 is tightly regulated through various mechanisms including gene expression, protein turnover (mediated by auto-ubiquitylation), protein\u2013protein interaction with key regulators, and post-translational modification, mainly, but not exclusively, by multisite phosphorylation. The purpose of the present article is to review our current knowledge of the signalling mechanisms that focus on MDM2, and indeed MDMX, through both phosphorylation mechanisms and peptide-docking events and to consider the wider implications of these regulatory events in the context of coordinated regulation of the p53 response. This analysis also provides an opportunity to consider the signalling pathways regulating MDM2 as potential targets for non-genotoxic therapies aimed at restoring p53 function in tumour cells.",

     "abstract": "The reactivation of mutant forms of the transcriptional regulator p53 or artificially raising activated p53 levels in a controlled nongenotoxic manner are seen as two of the grand challenges in anti-cancer drug discovery. Recent reports suggest that these demanding goals are achievable. This review article focuses on the use of cell-based high-throughput screening to discover novel nongenotoxic activators of endogenous p53. This challenging approach to the early phases of drug discovery prioritises the discovery of compounds with activity in cells in the hope that the compounds discovered will ultimately be of more direct relevance to therapeutic development. However, this approach also requires that protein target identification studies are carried out. We, and others, have shown that whilst a sometimes daunting proposition, it is possible to identify the targets of compounds that activate p53.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant p53 function is one of the major requirements for tumor development. Reactivation of p53 function by small molecules is a promising strategy to combat cancer due to potent tumor suppressor activities of p53. Recent developments in p53 biology reveal that manipulation of p53 function might pave way to a long cancer-free life. A number of small molecules which rescue p53 function by different mechanisms, acting upstream of p53 or targeting the p53 protein itself have been identified. Notably, these molecules trigger different biological outcomes, suggesting that it might be feasible to direct p53-mediated response in a desired way. In this review I discuss the latest developments in the search for small molecules which rescue p53 function by targeting the p53 protein.",

     "abstract": "p53 is a much studied transcription factor which has a key role in the maintenance of genetic stability. It belongs to a larger family of genes including two other highly related proteins, p63 and p73. The p53 pathway has a vital role in the prevention of cancer formation and is ubiquitously lost in a high percentage of human cancers. In 60% of cancer cases this occurs via p53 gene mutation. In the remaining cancers expressing a WTp53 gene, loss of cell signalling upstream or downstream of p53 are responsible for the inactivation of the p53 pathway.It has recently been described that the p53 gene encodes for nine different p53 isoforms, whereas the p63 and p73 genes encode for at least other 6 and 29, respectively. This finding may have a profound impact on our comprehension of p53 tumour suppressor activity. Studies in several tumour types have shown abnormal expression of these protein isoforms. Hence, better understanding of p53 tumour suppressor activity and the interaction between p53 family members and their isoforms is likely to bring us closer to cancer therapy. Therapeutic manipulation of the p53 pathway is therefore a highly promising field and already the focus of extensive investigation. Many strategies are being developed to either restore inactive/suppressed wild-type p53 (WTp53) or reverse the p53 mutant phenotype into WTp53. As p53 pathway inactivation is a common denominator to all cancers, it is highly expected that these therapies will be able to target a broad range of cancers and will allow for more specific targeting of cancer cells, avoiding collateral damage to normal tissue.",
