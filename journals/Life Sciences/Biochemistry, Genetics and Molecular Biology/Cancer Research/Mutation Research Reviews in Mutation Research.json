     "abstract": "Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is an aggressive cancer associated with asbestos exposure. Studies of familial malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) have suggested the existence of a genetic predisposition. Information on the role of genetic risk factors in the development of MM has been growing in the last years, and both low- and high-risk genetic factors have been identified, but genetic factors alone (without any exposure to asbestos or other mineral fibers) have never been shown to induce MM.Low-risk genetic factors have been identified in studies that systematically analyzed the whole genome. When considered alone these low-risk genetic factors carry a relative risk of MPM that is 10- to 15-fold lower than that carried by asbestos exposure; however, a large number of these factors in combination may increase the impact of asbestos exposure.High-risk genetic factors include truncating variants in the tumor suppressor BAP1 and in other tumor suppressor genes belonging to DNA repair pathways. Heterozygous germline variants in these genes may favor carcinogenesis if a second somatic variant occurs that impairs the wild-type allele. This impairment can cause genetic instability due to the suppression of a specific DNA repair pathway, and transformation.This genetic predisposition may have translational consequences, as it may predict patient response to drugs that induce tumor-specific synthetic lethality.",

     "abstract": "A biomarker-based approach using micronucleus (MN) (extranuclear DNA-containing bodies) frequencies in buccal cells has been proposed to monitor workers exposed to aero-digestive carcinogens for early detection of occupational cancer. To assess this non-invasive MN approach, we sought to understand: (A) What is the extent of MN frequency increase in occupationally exposed over non-exposed populations across studies published in the scientific literature for buccal cells; and (B) Which types of occupational exposures give relevant summary MN ratios across studies published in the scientific literature.A systematic literature review was performed, and the MN frequency ratios for buccal cells were calculated for each occupational study. Meta-analytic techniques were applied using the confidence interval or a standard error on the log-transformed ratio. Exposure categories were developed based on similar occupational exposures or jobs. A summary ratio and proportion of variance explained (the I2 index) were derived assuming a Gaussian random effect model for each exposure category.The meta-analysis of the published literature (n\u202f=\u202f96 studies) showed large random variability between studies within each category (I2\u202f>\u202f90%), except where exposures were to a single carcinogenic substance (e.g. formaldehyde, silica) or similar jobs were performed (e.g. antineoplastic dispensing, gasoline attendants). The greatest summary frequency ratios were for silica (FR 9.02 95%CI 6.83\u201311.93), formaldehyde (FR 4.81 95%CI 2.19\u201310.60), and for hairdressers as an exposure category (FR 7.06 95%CI 3.96\u201312.57).The unexplained between-study variability can be related to exposures to mixtures of carcinogens with unknown mechanisms. If the latter had been measured, the between-study variability may have been explained.We conclude that better exposure assessments are needed to understand the relationship between occupational exposures and MN frequency responses in buccal cells. Nevertheless, our analysis indicates that the buccal cell MN assay is a promising tool for surveying workers exposed to genotoxic agents.",

     "publication date": "09-2019",
     "abstract": "Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy (BSCL) is a rare disease characterized by the near total absence of body fat at birth. BSCL etiology involves genetic variations in four different genes: AGPAT2, BSCL2, CAV1, and CAVIN1. The four different biochemical subtypes of the disease are distinguished depending on which gene is mutated. The diagnosis of lipodystrophy can be based on clinical criteria, but the gold standard remains genetic testing. Since many different mutations have already been correlated with the onset of the disease, the most indicative method is DNA sequencing. However, not all laboratories have the resources to perform sequencing. Thus, less expensive techniques that include narrow gene regions may be applied. In such cases, the target mutations to be tested must be carefully determined taking into account the frequency of the description of the mutations in the literature, the nationality of the patient, as well as their phenotype. This review considers the molecular basis of BSCL, including the manual count of the majority of mutations reported in the literature up to the year 2018. Ninety different genetic mutations in 332 cases were reported at different frequencies. Some mutations were distributed homogeneously and others were specific to geographic regions. Type 2 BSCL was mentioned most often in the literature (50.3% of the cases), followed by Type 1 (38.0%), Type 4 (10.2%), and Type 3 (1.5%). The mutations comprised frameshifts (34.4%), nonsense (26.6%), and missense (21.1%). The c.517dupA in the BSCL2 gene was the most frequent (13.3%), followed by c.589-2A>G in the AGPAT2 gene (11.5%), c.507_511delGTATC in the BSCL2 gene (9.7%), c.317\u2212588del in the AGPAT2 gene (7.3%), and c.202C>T in the AGPAT2 gene (4.5%). This information should prove valuable for analysts in making decisions regarding the best therapeutic targets in a population-specific context, which will benefit patients and enable faster and less expensive treatment.",

     "publication date": "09-2019",
     "abstract": "The number of studies showing adverse effects on living organisms induced by different types of man-made Electromagnetic Fields (EMFs) has increased tremendously. Hundreds of peer reviewed published studies show a variety of effects, the most important being DNA damage which is linked to cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, reproductive declines etc. Those studies that are far more effective in showing effects employ real-life Mobile Telephony (MT) exposures emitted by commercially available mobile phones. The present review - of results published by my group from 2006 until 2016 - compares DNA fragmentation induced by six different EMFs on the same biological system - the oogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster - under identical conditions and procedures. Such a direct comparison between different EMFs - especially those employed in daily life - on the same biological endpoint, is very useful for drawing conclusions on their bioactivity, and novel. It shows that real MT EMFs are far more damaging than 50\u2009Hz alternating magnetic field (MF) - similar or much stronger to those of power lines - or a pulsed electric field (PEF) found before to increase fertility. The MT EMFs were significantly more bioactive even for much shorter exposure durations than the other EMFs. Moreover, they were more damaging than previously tested cytotoxic agents like certain chemicals, starvation, dehydration. Individual parameters of the real MT EMFs like intensity, frequency, exposure duration, polarization, pulsing, modulation, are discussed in terms of their role in bioactivity. The crucial parameter for the intense bioactivity seems to be the extreme variability of the polarized MT signals, mainly due to the large unpredictable intensity changes.",

     "publication date": "06-2019",
     "abstract": "The micronucleus (MN) assay has been used to determine the potential genotoxic effects in human populations exposed to arsenic. Some of these studies found an increase in MN frequency among exposed individuals, but others found no increase or inconclusive results. Thus, the main purpose of this current study was to investigate whether MN can be used as a biomarker for the arsenic exposure, as well as whether or not the different cell types that have been used to monitor MN frequency differ in their sensitivity to upon arsenic exposure. A systematic literature review was conducted followed by a meta-analysis. The review identified 25 useful studies with data from 3232 exposed individuals (15 studies assaying lymphocytes, 16 assaying buccal cells, and 9 assaying urothelial cells), with 18 studies measuring drinking water exposure, 5 measuring occupational exposure, one measuring coal burning, and one measuring dietary exposure. The meta-analysis indicated that the overall estimates of Mean Ratio (MR, defined as the mean value of the response in the exposed group divided by the mean value of the response in the reference group) were 2.95 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.00 to 4.35), 2.36 (95% CI: 1.77 to 3.15), and 2.82 (95% CI: 1.86 to 4.28) for MN assays conducted with lymphocytes, buccal cells, and urothelial cells in the MN assay, respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that when the exposure method was drinking water, the MN frequencies increased significantly in lymphocytes (MR\u2009=\u20093.59, 95% CI: 2.30 to 5.60), in buccal cells (MR\u2009=\u20092.35, 95% CI: 1.76 to 3.15), and in urothelial cells (MR\u2009=\u20093.16, 95% CI: 2.02 to 4.97). However, when the exposure method was the occupational setting or others, the MN detection using the three types of cells did not find significant differences between groups. Subgroup analysis also showed that lymphocyte MN frequencies increased significantly in both routine-culture MN assays (MR\u2009=\u20092.88, 95% CI: 1.15 to 7.24) and cytokinesis-block MN assays (MR\u2009=\u20092.89, 95% CI: 1.84 to 4.55). The performance of the MN assay with different types of cells was also compared, but no significant differences were found. Therefore, our analysis indicates that MN can be used as an effective biomarker for monitoring arsenic-exposed populations, and that MN assays conducted with lymphocytes, buccal cells, and urothelial cells do not differ in their ability to detect the genetic damage from arsenic.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises from accumulated genetic and epigenetic alterations, which provide the possibility to identify tumor-specific biomarkers by analyzing fecal DNA. Methylation status in human genes from tumor tissue is highlighted as promising biomarker in the early detection of CRC. A number of studies have documented altered methylation levels in DNA extracted from stool samples, but generated heterogeneous results. We performed a systematic review and quantitative assessment of existing studies to compare levels of DNA methylation in most frequently studied genes and their diagnostic value in CRC and its precursor, colorectal adenoma, with their counterparts in healthy subjects. Robust searches of the literature were performed in our study with explicit strategies and definite inclusion/exclusion criteria. Pooled data revealed that methylation levels of SFRP2, SFRP1, TFPI2, BMP3, NDRG4, SPG20, and BMP3 plus NDRG4 genes exceeded a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 80% for CRC detection. The DOR of the seven candidate biomarkers ranged from 19.80 to 334.33, indicating a good diagnostic power in discriminating cancer from normal tissues. The AUC range was from 0.88 to 0.95, indicating a good or very good discriminatory performance. When test results for BMP3 and NDRG4 were combined, the DOR of CRC detection was 98.36, which was higher than that for BMP3 and NDRG4 separately. As for adenoma detection, the DOR of methylated NDRG4 is higher than that for CRC (CRC vs. adenoma: 54.86 vs. 57.22). Both the sensitivity and specificity of NDRG4 for adenoma detection exceeded 70%. These findings demonstrate the eligibility and feasibility of DNA methylation as a minimally invasive biomarker in feces in the diagnosis of CRC and adenoma. The use of DNA from human stools has the potential to be readily applicable to detect aberrant DNA methylation levels among many subjects for CRC early screening.",

     "publication date": "03-2019",
     "abstract": "Micronuclei (MN), the small nucleus-like bodies separated from the primary nucleus, can exist in cells with numerical and/or structural chromosomal aberrations in apparently normal tissues and more so in tumors in humans. While MN have been observed for over 100 years, they were merely and constantly considered as passive indicators of chromosome instability (CIN) for a long time. Relatively little is known about the molecular origins and biological consequences of MN. Rapid technological advances are helping to close these gaps. Very recent studies provide exciting evidence that MN act as key platform for chromothripsis and a trigger of innate immune response, suggesting that MN could affect cellular functions by both genetic and nongenetic means. These previously unappreciated findings have reawakened widespread interests in MN. In this review, the diverse mechanisms leading to MN generation and the complex fate profiles of MN are discussed, together with the evidence for their contribution to CIN, inflammation, senescence and cell death. Moreover, we put this knowledge together into a speculative perspective on how MN may be responsible for cancer development and how their presence may influence the choice of treatment. We suggest that the heterogeneous responses to MN may function physiological to ensure the arrestment, elimination and immune clearance of damaged cells, but pathologically, may enable the survival and oncogenic transformation of cells bearing CIN. These insights not only underscore the complexity of MN biology, but also raise a host of new questions and provide fertile ground for future research.",

Nearly a century has passed since the first report of glaucoma manifested following ionizing radiation therapy of cancers. Nevertheless, associations between glaucoma and radiation exposures, a dose response relationship, and the mechanistic underpinnings remain incompletely understood. Here we review the current knowledge on manifestations and mechanisms of radiogenic glaucoma. There is some evidence that neovascular glaucoma is manifest relatively quickly, within a few years after high-dose and high dose-rate radiotherapeutic exposure, but little evidence of excess risks of glaucoma after exposure to much lower doses or dose rates. As such, glaucoma appears to have some of the characteristics of a tissue reaction effect, with a threshold of at least 5\u2009Gy but possibly much higher.",

     "abstract": "Individual variations in erythrocyte parameters are influenced by factors like sex, age, diet and season. Genetic variations have also been associated with erythrocyte parameters. The aim of this systematic review is to provide an overview of associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and erythrocyte parameters in humans. A systematic review protocol was published at the international prospective register of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42016053052). Literature searches were conducted in Medline and Embase. Studies were included if: investigating a(n) causality/association/correlation; population-based; investigating a human population of Caucasian/mixed-ethnic descent; and written in English, Dutch or German. Study quality was assessed using the quality of genetic association studies tool. In total, 4385 studies were screened on title/abstract and 194 studies were screened on full text. Inclusion criteria were met by 13 candidate gene studies (n\u2009=\u2009126\u201349,488) and eight genome-wide association studies (GWASes, n\u2009=\u20091664\u2013116,666). One moderate and six good quality GWAS(es) identified 1237 SNPs located in/near 241 genes. SNPs in/near ten genes were found to be associated with one or more erythrocyte parameter(s) by multiple GWASes, namely HIST1H2AC, MPST, SLC17A1 and SLC17A3 with mean cell hemoglobin (MCH), HIST1H1T and KCTD17 with MCH and mean cell volume (MCV), HBS1L and MYB with MCH, MCV and red cell count (RCC), HFE with MCH, MCV and hemoglobin, and TMPRSS6 with MCH, MCV, hemoglobin and mean cell hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). Four genes were found across multiple erythrocyte parameters by one study in each parameter. Fourteen SNPs were associated with one or more erythrocyte parameter(s) in multiple cohorts, namely rs129128, rs17342717, rs228129 and rs5756504 (MCH), rs4895441, rs7775698, rs9376092 and rs9494145 (MCH, MCV, RCC), rs6569992 (MCH, RCC), rs1800562 (hemoglobin, MCH, MCV), rs130624 and rs198846 (MCH, MCV), rs4820268 and rs855791 (MCH, MCV, MCHC). Further research on these fourteen genes in erythropoiesis is recommended, especially eight whose role in erythropoiesis is unclear.",

     "abstract": "Ionizing radiation (IR) damages DNA and other macromolecules, including proteins and lipids. Most cell types can repair DNA damage and cycle continuously their macromolecules as a mechanism to remove defective proteins and lipids. In those cells that lack nuclei and other organelles, such as lens fiber cells and mammalian erythrocytes, IR-induced damage to macromolecules is retained because they cannot be easily replenished. Whilst the life span for an erythrocyte is several months, the life span of a human lens is decades. There is very limited turnover in lens macromolecules, therefore the aging process greatly impacts lens structure and function over its lifetime. The lens is a tissue where biomolecular longevity, lifelong retention of its components and continued growth are integral to its homeostasis. These characteristics make the lens an excellent model to study the contribution of retained macromolecular damage over time. Epidemiological data have revealed a significant association between exposure to IR, the loss of lens optical function and the formation of cataracts (cataractogenesis) later in life. Lifestyle, genetic and environmental factors all contribute to cataractogenesis due to their effect on the aging process. Cataract is an iconic age-related disease in humans. IR is a recognised cause of cataract and the occupational lens dose limit is reduced from 150 to 20\u2009mGy / year averaged over 5 years (ICRP Publication 118). Understanding the effects of low dose IR on the lens and its role in cataractogenesis is therefore very important. So we redefine \u201ccataractogenic load\u201d as a term to account for the combined lifestyle, genetic and environmental processes that increase biomolecular damage to lens macromolecules leading to cataract formation. These processes weaken metabolic defenses, increase post-translational protein modifications, and alter the lipid structure and content of the lens. IR exposure is a significant insult to the lens because of free radical generation and the ensuing oxidative stress. We support the concept that damage caused by IR compounds the aging process by increasing the cataractogenic load, hereby accelerating lens aging and its loss of function.",

The assay itself can be applied on virtually any cell type derived from different organs and tissues of eukaryotic organisms. Although it is mainly used on human cells, the assay has applications also in the evaluation of DNA damage in yeast, plant and animal cells. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to give an extensive overview on the usage of the comet assay in animal models from invertebrates to vertebrates, covering both terrestrial and water biota. The comet assay is used in a variety of invertebrate species since they are regarded as interesting subjects in ecotoxicological research due to their significance in ecosystems. Hence, the first part of the review (Part 1) will discuss the application of the comet assay in invertebrates covering protozoans, platyhelminthes, planarians, cnidarians, molluscs, annelids, arthropods and echinoderms. Besides a large number of animal species, the assay is also performed on a variety of cells, which includes haemolymph, gills, digestive gland, sperm and embryo cells. The mentioned cells have been used for the evaluation of a broad spectrum of genotoxic agents both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the use of invertebrate models and their role from an ecotoxicological point of view will also be discussed as well as the comparison of the use of the comet assay in invertebrate and human models. Since the comet assay is still developing, its increasing potential in assessing DNA damage in animal models is crucial especially in the field of ecotoxicology and biomonitoring at the level of different species, not only humans.",

     "abstract": "Copy number variants (CNVs) are intermediate-scale structural variants containing copy number changes involving DNA fragments of between 1\u2009kb and 5 Mb. Although known to account for a significant proportion of the genetic burden in human disease, the role of CNVs (especially small CNVs) is often underestimated, as they are undetectable by traditional Sanger sequencing. Since the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, several research groups have compared depth of coverage (DoC) patterns between samples, an approach that may facilitate effective CNV detection. Most CNV detection tools based on DoC comparisons are designed to work with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or whole-exome sequencing (WES) data. However, few methods developed to date are designed for custom/commercial targeted NGS (tg-NGS) panels, the assays most commonly used for diagnostic purposes. Moreover, the development and evaluation of these tools is hindered by (i) the scarcity of thoroughly annotated data containing CNVs and (ii) a dearth of simulation tools for WES and tg-NGS that mimic the errors and biases encountered in these data. Here, we review DoC-based CNV detection methods described in the current literature, assess their performance with simulated tg-NGS data, and discuss their strengths and weaknesses when integrated into the daily laboratory workflow. Our findings suggest that the best methods for CNV detection in tg-NGS panels are DECoN, ExomeDepth, and ExomeCNV. Regardless of the method used, there is a need to make these programs more user-friendly to enable their use by diagnostic laboratory staff who lack bioinformatics training.",

During the last two decades, epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as important regulators of chromatin alteration and the reprogramming of gene expression. Recently, epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) genesis. Epigenetic mechanisms could be used as potential therapeutic targets and as noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers for NAFLD. These mechanisms can determine disease progression and prognosis in NAFLD.

On the basis of striking similarities between these different types of responses RIBE is proposed as a prototype model of a unifying genotoxic stress response system.The early bystander response is initiated by a mitochondria-dependent increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggers a complex intercellular signalling cascade leading to a sustained increase of cellular DNA damage. The susceptibility to this DNA damage-inducing signal depends on the genetic make-up of the recipient cell population where ATR/ATM- and FA/BRCA-dependent DNA damage response pathways are key players. Long distance bystander/systemic effects observed in in vivo-models are sustained by macrophage-mediated inflammation.Of clinical importance is the potential contribution of bystander DNA damage to an increased risk of malignancies. Defects in DNA damage repair pathways are frequently observed in tumours, which may affect their susceptibility to bystander DNA damage. The potential role for molecular targeted inhibitors in the therapeutic exploitation of bystander responses as well as their differential modulation of targeted and non-targeted effects is also discussed in this context.",

Obesity leads to a physiological imbalance in the regulation of adipose tissue and its normal functioning, resulting in hyperglycaemia, dyslipidaemia and inflammation. These states promote the generation of oxidative stress, which is exacerbated in obesity by a decline in anti-oxidant defence systems. Oxidative stress can have a marked impact on DNA, producing mutagenic lesions that could prove carcinogenic. Here we review the current evidence for genomic instability, sustained DNA damage and accelerated genome ageing in obesity. We explore the notion of genotoxicity, ensuing from systemic oxidative stress, as a key oncogenic factor in obesity. Finally, we advocate for early, pre-malignant assessment of genome integrity and stability to inform surveillance strategies and interventions.",

     "abstract": "Paternal exposure to environmental challenges plays a critical role in the offspring's future health and the transmission of acquired traits through generations. This review summarizes our current knowledge in the new field of epigenomic paternal transmission of health and disease. Epidemiological studies identified that paternal ageing or challenges (imbalanced diets, stress, toxicants, cigarette smoke, alcohol) increased the risk of offspring to develop diseases such as cancer, metabolic, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. These data were confirmed and deepened in animal models of exposure to challenges including low-protein, low-folate, high-fat diets, exposure to chemicals such as pesticides and herbicides. Even though some toxicants have mutagenic effect on sperm DNA, changes in sperm epigenome seem to be a common thread between different types of challenges. Indeed, epigenetic changes (DNA methylation, chromatin remodeling, small non-coding RNA) in sperm are described as new mechanisms of intergenerational transmission as demonstrated for dioxin, for example. Those epimutations induce dysregulation in genes expression involved in key cellular pathways such as reactive oxygen species and genome stability regulation, in brain-derived neurotrophic factor, calcium and glucocorticoid signaling, and in lipid and glucose metabolism, leading to diseases in offspring. Finally, since each type of environmental challenges has its own signature by inducing epimutations at specific genomic loci, the sperm epigenome might be used as a biomarker in toxicological and risk assessments.",

In humans, cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP3A7 in liver and CYP2A13 in lung are essential for the bioactivation of AFB1 to the extremely toxic exo-AFB1-8,9-epoxide (AFBO), whereas CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2A6, and CYP3A4 are important in the turkey and duck, CYP1A1 and CYP2A6 are important in the chicken and quail, CYP3A11 and CYP3A13 are important in mice, and CYP2A5 are important in the hamster. In contrast, glutathione-S-transferase (GST) M1 and GSTT1 are primary responsible for detoxification of the AFB1 by catalyzing the conjugation of GSH to AFBO in humans, whereas GSTM2 in a nonhuman primate, GSTA3 in mice, GSTA5 in rats, and GSTA1, GSTA2, GSTA3 and GSTA4 in the turkey are important. Additionally, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) and aflatoxin-aldehyde reductase (AFAR) have also been shown to play key roles in AFB1 detoxification in the human, rat, and pig. Moreover, an overview of the chemoprotective agents, including synthetic compounds and naturally occurring plant compounds, which can be used to reduce aflatoxicosis is provided based on their ability to regulate these key enzymes.

For myeloid tumors, monoclonal tumor origin may be the predominant path to cancer and a monoclonal tumor origin cannot be ruled out for a fraction of other cancer types. Nevertheless, a large body of evidence supports the conclusion that most cancers are multiclonal in origin. Cooperation between different cell types and between clones of cells carrying different genetic and/or epigenetic lesions is discussed, along with how polyclonal tumor origin can be integrated with current perspectives on the genesis of tumors. In order to develop biologically sound and useful approaches to cancer risk assessment and precision medicine, mathematical models of carcinogenesis are needed, which incorporate multiclonal tumor origin and the contributions of spontaneous mutations in conjunction with the selective advantages conferred by particular mutations and combinations of mutations. Adherence to the idea that a growth must develop from a single progenitor cell to be considered neoplastic has outlived its usefulness. Moving forward, explicit examination of tumor clonality, using advanced tools, like lineage tracing models, will provide a strong foundation for future advances in clinical oncology and better training for the next generation of oncologists and pathologists.",

     "abstract": "DNA sequence is a powerful tool that can be used for an individual\u2019s identification and investigation of various abnormalities in the genome. However, recent studies have identified other heritable changes by epigenetic mechanisms that cause changes in gene expression without altering the DNA sequence itself. In particular, DNA methylation mediates long-lasting changes in gene promoters, which makes it an appealing epigenetic mechanism to study variation in methylation status that characterizes the extent of drug abuse. We summarize recent findings on methylation alterations in a number of genes caused by various drugs including cocaine, opioids, cannabinoids, amphetamine, phenobarbital, and alcohol in various human and animal model studies. Additionally, a minimal discussion of the basic concepts of methylation is provided. The determination of possible DNA methylation alterations can assist in finding the cause and circumstances of death or ailment, and gene markers can be potentially used as biomarkers in the future.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, the paradigm that genomic abnormalities in cancer cells arise through progressive accumulation of mutational events has been challenged by the discovery of single catastrophic events. One such phenomenon termed chromothripsis, involving massive chromosomal rearrangements arising all at once, has emerged as a major mutational game changer. The strong interest in this process stems from its widespread association with a range of cancer types and its potential as a mutational driver.In this review, we first describe chromothripsis detection and incidence in cancers. We then explore recently proposed underlying mechanistic origins, which explain the curious observations of the highly localised nature of the rearrangements on chromothriptic chromosomes. Detection of chromothriptic patterns following incorporation of single chromosomes into micronuclei or following telomere attrition have greatly contributed to our understanding of the reasons behind this chromosomal restriction. These underlying cellular events have been found to be participants in the tumourigenic process, strongly suggesting a potential role for chromothripsis in cancer development. Thus, we discuss potential implications of chromothripsis for cancer progression and therapy.",

     "abstract": "Anemia is defined by a deficiency of hemoglobin, an iron-rich protein that binds oxygen in the blood. It can be due to multiple causes, either acquired or genetic. Alterations of genes involved in iron metabolism may be responsible, usually at a young age, for rare forms of chronic and often severe congenital anemia. These diseases encompass a variety of sideroblastic anemias, characterized by the presence of ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow. Clinical expression of congenital sideroblastic anemia is either monosyndromic (restricted to hematological lineages) or polysyndromic (with systemic expression), depending on whether iron metabolism, and especially heme synthesis, is directly or indirectly affected. Beside sideroblastic anemias, a number of other anemias can develop due to mutations of key proteins acting either on cellular iron transport (such as the DMT1 transporter), plasma iron transport (transferrin), and iron recycling (ceruloplasmin). Contrasting with the aforementioned entities which involve compartmental, and sometimes, systemic iron excess, the iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) corresponds to a usually severe anemia with whole body iron deficiency related to chronic increase of plasma hepcidin, the systemic negative regulator of plasma iron. Once clinically suggested, these diseases are confirmed by genetic testing in specialized laboratories.",

     "abstract": "Health authorities are alarmed worldwide about the increase of obesity and overweight in the last decades which lead to adverse health effects including inflammation, cancer, accelerated aging and infertility. We evaluated the state of knowledge concerning the impact of elevated body mass on genomic instability. Results of investigations with humans (39 studies) in which DNA damage was monitored in lymphocytes and sperm cells, are conflicting and probably as a consequence of heterogeneous study designs and confounding factors (e.g. uncontrolled intake of vitamins and minerals and consumption of different food types). Results of animal studies with defined diets (23 studies) are more consistent and show that excess body fat causes DNA damage in multiple organs including brain, liver, colon and testes. Different molecular mechanisms may cause genetic instability in overweight/obese individuals. ROS formation and lipid peroxidation were found in several investigations and may be caused by increased insulin, fatty acid and glucose levels or indirectly via inflammation. Also reduced DNA repair and formation of advanced glycation end products may play a role but more data are required to draw firm conclusions. Reduction of telomere lengths and hormonal imbalances are characteristic for overweight/obesity but the former effects are delayed and moderate and hormonal effects were not investigated in regard to genomic instability in obese individuals. Increased BMI values affect also the activities of drug metabolizing enzymes which activate/detoxify genotoxic carcinogens, but no studies concerning the impact of these alterations of DNA damage in obese individuals are available. Overall, the knowledge concerning the impact of increased body weight and DNA damage is poor and further research is warranted to shed light on this important issue.",

     "abstract": "Cell cycle and apoptosis regulator 2 (CCAR2 or DBC1) is a human protein recently emerged as a novel and important player of the DNA damage response (DDR). Indeed, upon genotoxic stress, CCAR2, phosphorylated by the apical DDR kinases ATM and ATR, increases its binding to the NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase SIRT1 and inhibits SIRT1 activity. This event promotes the acetylation and activation of p53, a SIRT1 target, and the subsequent induction of p53 dependent apoptosis. In addition, CCAR2 influences DNA repair pathway choice and promotes the chromatin relaxation necessary for the repair of heterochromatic DNA lesions. However, besides DDR, CCAR2 is involved in several other cellular functions. Indeed, through the interaction with transcription factors, nuclear receptors, epigenetic modifiers and RNA polymerase II, CCAR2 regulates transcription and transcript elongation. Moreover, promoting Rev-erb\u03b1 protein stability and repressing BMAL1 and CLOCK expression, it was reported to modulate the circadian rhythm. Through SIRT1 inhibition, CCAR2 is also involved in metabolism control and, suppressing RelB and p65 activities in the NFkB pathway, it restricts B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin production. Notably, CCAR2 expression is deregulated in several tumors and, compared to the non-neoplastic counterpart, it may be up- or down-regulated. Since its up-regulation in cancer patients is usually associated with poor prognosis and its depletion reduces cancer cell growth in vitro, CCAR2 was suggested to act as a tumor promoter. However, there is also evidence that CCAR2 functions as a tumor suppressor and therefore its role in cancer formation and progression is still unclear. In this review we discuss CCAR2 functions in the DDR and its multiple biological activities in unstressed cells.",

Early diagnosis of this condition is essential to effectively treat patients for better prognosis. A significant amount of advancement has been made in understanding the molecular nature of cancer in the past decade. A substantial number of mutations and alterations have been detected in various tumors. Despite the occurrence of AVC across the globe, the number of studies conducted on this tumor type remains low; this is largely due to its rare occurrence. Moreover, AVC tissues are complex and contain mutations in oncogenes, tumour suppressors, apoptotic proteins, cell proliferation proteins, cell signaling proteins, transcription factors, chromosomal abnormalities and cellular adhesion proteins. The frequently mutated genes included KRAS, TP53 and SMAD4 and are associated with prognosis. Several molecules of the PI3K, Wnt signaling, TGF-beta pathway and cell cycle have also been altered in AVCs. This review comprises of all the genetic mutations, associated pathways and related prognosis that are involved in AVCs from the year 1989 to 2017. This report can be used as a stepping-stone to establish biomarkers for early diagnosis of AVC and to discover molecular targets for drug therapy.",

     "abstract": "Tryptophan is metabolized primarily via the kynurenine pathway (KP), which involves several enzymes, including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, tryptophan 2,3 dioxygenase (TDO), kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) etc. The majority of metabolites are neuroactive: some of them, such as kynurenic acid, show neuroprotective effects, while others contribute to free radical production, leading to neurodegeneration. Imbalance of the pathway is assumed to contribute to the development of several neurodegenerative diseases, psychiatric disorders, migraine and multiple sclerosis.Our aim was to summarize published data on genetic alterations of enzymes involved in the KP leading to disturbances of the pathway that can be related to different diseases.To achieve this, a PubMed literature search was performed for publications on genetic alterations of the KP enzymes upto April 2017.Several genetic alterations of the KP have been identified and have been proposed to be associated with diseases. Here we must emphasize that despite the large number of recognized genetic alterations, the number of firmly established causal relations with specific diseases is still small. The realization of this by those interested in the field is very important and finding such connections should be a major focus of related research.Polymorphisms of the genes encoding the enzymes of the KP have been associated with autism, multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia, and were shown to affect the immune response of patients with bacterial meningitis, just to mention a few.To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive review of the genetic alterations of the KP enzymes. We believe that the identification of genetic alterations underlying diseases has great value regarding both treatment and diagnostics in precision medicine, as this work can promote the understanding of pathological mechanisms, and might facilitate medicinal chemistry approaches to substitute missing components or correct the disturbed metabolite balance of KP.",

     "abstract": "People are more often exposed to low as opposed to high doses of ionising radiation (IR). Knowledge on the health risks associated with exposures to ionising radiation above 100\u202fmGy is quite well established, while lower dose risks are inferred from higher level exposure information (ICRP). The health risk assessments are mainly based on epidemiological data derived from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, medical exposure studies and follow-up studies after nuclear accidents. For the estimation of long-term stochastic radiation health effects (such as cancer) and radiation protection purposes, a linear non-threshold (LNT) model is applied. However, the general validity of the LNT hypothesis for extrapolations from effects of high to low doses (<100\u202fmGy) and low dose-rates (<6\u202fmGy/h) has been questioned as epidemiological studies are statistically limited at low doses and unable to evaluate low dose and low dose-rate health risks (UNSCEAR). Thus, uncertainties on health risks need to be clarified with the help of mechanistic studies.The European Network of Excellence DoReMi (2010\u20132016) was designed to address some of the existing uncertainties and to identify research lines that are likely to be most informative for low dose risk assessment. The present review reports the results obtained from studies addressing the induction of cancer and non-cancer effects by low dose IR as well as on individual radiation sensitivity. It is shown that low dose and low dose-rate effects are the result of complex network responses including genetic, epigenetic, metabolic and immunological regulation. Evidence is provided for the existence of nonlinear biological responses in the low and medium dose range as well as effects other than the classical DNA damage. Such effects may have a bearing on the quantitative and qualitative judgements on health effects induced by low dose radiations.",

Bacterial communities within the microbiome, bacteriome, by its mass, symbiotic or competitive position and composition are in a fragile balance with the host organisms and have a crucial impact on their homeostasis. Bacteriome taxonomic composition is modulated by age, sex and host genetic profile and may be changed by adverse environmental exposures and life style factors such as diet or drug intake. A changed and/or misbalanced bacteriome has genotoxic potential with significant impact on the pathogenesis of acute, chronic and neoplastic diseases in the host organism. Bacteria may produce genotoxins, express a variety of pathways in which they generate free radicals or affect DNA repair causing genome damage, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, modulate immune response and launch carcinogenesis in the host organism. Future investigations should focus on the interplay between exposure to xenobiotics and bacteriome composition, immunomodulation caused by misbalanced bacteriome, impact of the environment on bacteriome composition in children and its lifelong effect on health risks.",

Many mutagens have been thought to operate via a single principal mechanism, with secondary effects usually resulting in only minor changes in the observed mutation frequencies and spectra. For example, we conceive of base analogs as resulting in direct mispairing as their main mechanism of mutagenesis. Recent studies now show that in fact even these simple mutagens can cause very large and unanticipated effects both in mutation frequencies and in the mutational spectra when used in certain pair-wise combinations.

     "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide. The observed variability in progression and responses to the same treatment between patients underlie the genetic heterogeneity of the disease. Nowadays, screening and follow-up biomarkers in PC are still having a deep lack of information, which makes difficult the cancer diagnosis, prognosis and the selection of the most suitable therapies. This is making that currently unnecessary biopsies, over-treatments and hormonoresistances have high rates of prevalence among patients. New biomarkers are urgently needed and in this sense genomic biomarkers could be the most suitable tools. These genetic markers will be helpful for improving the precision of prognostic and the predictive current tools which are employed in the clinical practice. A recent literature search up was conducted, including clinical trials and pre-clinical basic research studies. Keywords included germline variants, prostate cancer, biomarkers, androgen deprivation therapy, screening and liquid biopsy; among others. We have reviewed how germline variants, CNVs and repetitive regions are relevant to prostate carcinogenesis, treatment and progression. Moreover, we have also considered novel biomarkers for PC prognosis based on differentially expressed genes. Finally, we have included new strategies in recent markers of liquid biopsy or updated technologies for minimal samples analysis. The improvement of genetic markers use and their application to the clinical practice, will enhance the variability of simple, non-invasive, tools such as liquid biopsy and germline variants, these will reduce the number of PC needle biopsies and current over-treatments that are usual in the management of this cancer.",

     "abstract": "Research on disease causation often attempts to isolate the effects of individual factors, including individual genes or environmental factors. This reductionist approach has generated many discoveries, but misses important interactive and cumulative effects that may help explain the broad range of variability in disease occurrence observed across studies and individuals. A disease rarely results from a single factor, and instead results from a broader combination of factors, characterized here as intrinsic (I) and extrinsic (E) factors. Intrinsic vulnerability or resilience emanates from a variety of both fixed and shifting biological factors including genetic traits, while extrinsic factors comprise all biologically-relevant external stressors encountered across the lifespan. The I\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E concept incorporates the multi-factorial and dynamic nature of health and disease and provides a unified, conceptual basis for integrating results from multiple areas of research, including genomics, G\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E, developmental origins of health and disease, and the exposome. We describe the utility of the I\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E concept to better understand and characterize the cumulative impact of multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors on individual and population health. New research methods increasingly facilitate the measurement of multifactorial and interactive effects in epidemiological and toxicological studies. Tiered or indicator-based approaches can guide the selection of potentially relevant I and E factors for study and quantification, and exposomics methods may eventually produce results that can be used to generate a response function over the life course. Quantitative data on I\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E interactive effects should generate a better understanding of the variability in human response to environmental factors. The proposed I\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0E concept highlights the role for broader study design in order to identify extrinsic and intrinsic factors amenable to interventions at the individual and population levels in order to enhance resilience, reduce vulnerability and improve health.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic genome surveillance is dependent on the multiple, highly coordinated network functions of the DNA damage response (DDR). Highlighted conserved features of DDR in plants and animals represent a challenging opportunity to develop novel interdisciplinary investigations aimed at expanding the sets of DNA damage biomarkers currently available for radiation exposure monitoring (REM) in environmental and biomedical applications. In this review, common and divergent features of the most relevant DDR players in animals and plants are described, including the intriguing example of the plant and animal kingdom-specific master regulators SOG1 (suppressor of gamma response) and p53. The potential of chromatin remodelers as novel predictive biomarkers of DNA damage is considered since these highly evolutionarily conserved proteins provide a docking platform for the DNA repair machinery. The constraints of conventional REM biomarkers can be overcome using biomarkers identified with the help of the pool provided by high-throughput techniques. The complexity of radiation-responsive animal and plant transcriptomes and their usefulness as sources of novel REM biomarkers are discussed, focusing on ionizing (IR) and UV-radiation. The possible advantages resulting from the exploitation of plants as sources of novel DNA damage biomarkers for monitoring the response to radiation-mediated genotoxic stress are listed. Plants could represent an ideal system for the functional characterization of knockout mutations in DDR genes which compromise cell survival in animals. However, the pronounced differences between plant and animal cells need to be carefully considered in order to avoid any misleading interpretations. Radioresistant plant-based systems might be useful to explore the molecular bases of LD (low dose)/LDR (low dose rate) responses since nowadays it is extremely difficult to perform an accurate assessment of LD/LDR risk to human health. To overcome these constraints, researchers have started exploring radiotolerant non-human species as potential sources of information on the mechanisms involved in LD/LDR and general radiation responses.",

Mutations in the Rab escort protein-1 (REP-1), an ubiquitously encoded protein of the CHM gene, lead to prenylation and vesicle trafficking deficiency in the protein, resulting in the progressive degeneration of choriocapillaris, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and photoreceptors. Despite previous studies concerning this disease, no effective diagnostic tests or established therapeutic interventions currently exist for CHM. In this paper, we reviewed \u200ethe pathogenic \u200eeffects of synonymous hotspot mutation in the CHM gene and the genotypic\u2013phenotypic associations in families with CHM. In addition, we employed a combination of molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis to gain insight into the underlying molecular basis of these deleterious and disease-causing hotspot mutation \u200eanalogs. These computer predictions provide strong evidence that the C\u202f>\u202fT nonsynonymous hotspot mutations of CHM spectrum contribute to overall RPE retinopathy.

     "abstract": "Vinyl chloride (VC) is widely used in industry in the production of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), which is used to manufacture a large variety of materials. VC was classified as a known (Group 1) human carcinogen by IARC on the basis of increased risk for liver angiosarcoma and hepatocellular cancer, and the carcinogenicity of VC was shown to be mediated by a genotoxic mechanism. Following inhalation, the compound is rapidly absorbed and metabolized in the liver to the electrophilic metabolites chloroethylene-oxide and chloroacetaldehyde, which form DNA adducts that can be processed into point mutations in cancer-related genes detected in humans and rats exposed to VC. A number of genotoxicity biomarkers were applied in workers exposed to VC to detect early biological responses associated with the carcinogenesis process. The present systematic review analyzed the published studies in which the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in peripheral lymphocytes (L-CBMN) was applied in VC-exposed subjects. Thirteen out of fifteen retrieved studies performed in China showed increased MN frequencies (FR 1.92\u20133.98) associated with increased cumulative exposure or employment time. Twofold and more than threefold increases were detected in PVC-exposed workers exposed to a mean of 50\u00a0ppm of VC in the former Yugoslavia and in South India, respectively. The meta-analysis of MN frequency from six eligible studies confirmed this tendency (pooled MR 2.32 \u2013 95% CI 1.64\u20133.27). The benchmark dose lower limit for 10% excess risk (BMDL 10) calculated from three studies resulted in an estimated exposure limit of 0.03\u20130.07\u00a0mg/m3. Overall the results of this review showed the need for further studies, especially because PVC products from China may contain high levels of uncoupled VCM that could represent a source of exposure to workers and consumers. Moreover, the results underline the importance of re-evaluating the recommended exposure limits using new biomonitoring methods in addition to MN.",

Various transcriptional pathways are activated by inflammation, including pathways that are mediated via nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT-3), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1).

Sanguinaria canadensis, a major ingredient of black salve formulations, contains a number of bioactive phytochemicals including the alkaloid sanguinarine. Despite its prolonged history of clinical use, conflicting experimental results have prevented the carcinogenic potential of sanguinarine from being definitively determined.Sanguinarine has a molecular structure similar to known polyaromatic hydrocarbon carcinogens and is a DNA intercalator. Sanguinarine also generates oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress resulting in the unfolded protein response and the formation of 8-hydroxyguanine genetic lesions. Sanguinarine has been the subject of contradictory in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity and murine carcinogenesis test results that have delayed its carcinogenic classification. Despite this, epidemiological studies have linked mouthwash that contains sanguinarine with the development of oral leukoplakia. Sanguinarine is also proposed as an aetiological agent in gallbladder carcinoma.This literature review investigates the carcinogenic potential of sanguinarine. Reasons for contradictory genotoxicity and carcinogenesis results are explored, knowledge gaps identified and a strategy for determining the carcinogenic potential of sanguinarine especialy relating to black salve are discussed. As patients continue to apply black salve, especially to skin regions suffering from field cancerization and skin malignancies, an understanding of the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of sanguinarine is of urgent clinical relevance.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is unique among general toxins, because it is stable in abiotic environments at ambient temperature and neutral pH, yet rapidly kills any type of cells by producing highly-reactive hydroxyl radicals. This life-specific reactivity follows the distribution of soluble iron, Fe(II) (which combines with H2O2 to form the famous Fenton's reagent),Fe(II) is concentrated inside cells, but is virtually absent outside them. Because of the immediate danger of H2O2, all cells have powerful H2O2 scavengers, the equally famous catalases, which enable cells to survive thousand-fold higher concentrations of H2O2 and, in combination with adequate movement of H2O2 across membranes, make the killing H2O2 concentrations virtually impractical to generate in vivo. And yet, low concentrations of H2O2 are somehow used as an efficient biological weapon. Here we review several examples of how cells potentiate H2O2 toxicity with other chemicals. At first, these potentiators were thought to simply inhibit catalases, but recent findings with cyanide suggest that potentiators mostly promote the other side of Fenton's reaction, recruiting iron from cell depots into stable DNA-iron complexes that, in the presence of elevated H2O2, efficiently break duplex DNA, pulverizing the chromosome. This multifaceted potentiation of H2O2 toxicity results in robust and efficient killing.",

     "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor is inactivated in most cancers, thus suggesting that loss of p53 is a prerequisite for tumor growth. Therefore, its reintroduction through different means bears great clinical potential. After a brief introduction to current knowledge of p53 and its regulation by the ubiquitin-ligases MDM2/MDMX and post-translational modifications, we will discuss small molecules that are able to reactivate specific, frequently observed mutant forms of p53 and their applicability for clinical purposes. Many malignancies display amplification of MDM genes encoding negative regulators of p53 and therefore much effort to date has concentrated on the development of molecules that inhibit MDM2, the most advanced of which are being tested in clinical trials for sarcoma, glioblastoma, bladder cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. These will be discussed as will recent findings of MDMX inhibitors: these are of special importance as it has been shown that cancers that become resistant to MDM2 inhibitors often amplify MDM4. Finally, we will also touch on gene therapy and vaccination approaches; the former of which aims to replace mutated TP53 and the latter whose goal is to activate the body\u2019s immune system toward mutant p53 expressing cells. Besides the obvious importance of MDM2 and MDMX expression for regulation of p53, other regulatory factors should not be underestimated and are also described. Despite the beauty of the concept, the past years have shown that many obstacles have to be overcome to bring p53 reactivation to the clinic on a broad scale, and it is likely that in most cases it will be part of a combined therapeutic approach. However, improving current p53 targeted molecules and finding the best therapy partners will clearly impact the future of cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) is an acute phase secretory glycoprotein that inhibits neutrophil proteases like elastase and is considered as the archetype of a family of structurally related serine-protease inhibitors termed serpins. Serum AAT predominantly originates from liver and increases three to five fold during host response to tissue injury and inflammation. The AAT deficiency is unique among the protein-misfolding diseases in that it causes target organ injury by both loss-of-function and gain-of-toxic function mechanisms. Lack of its antiprotease activity is associated with premature development of pulmonary emphysema and loss-of-function due to accumulation of resultant aggregates in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This\u2019 in turn\u2019 markedly reduces the amount of AAT that is available to protect lungs against proteolytic attack by the enzyme neutrophil elastase. The coalescence of AAT deficiency, its reduced efficacy, and cigarette smoking or poor ventilation conditions have devastating effect on lung function. On the other hand, the accumulation of retained mutant proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes in a polymerized form rather than secreted into the blood in its monomeric form is associated with chronic liver disease and predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by gain- of- toxic function. Liver injury resulting from this gain-of-toxic function mechanism in which mutant AAT retained in the ER initiates a series of pathologic events, eventually culminating at liver cirrhosis and HCC. Here in this review, we underline the structural, genetic, polymorphic, biochemical and pathological advances made in the field of AAT deficiency and further comprehensively emphasize on the therapeutic interventions available for the patient.",

     "abstract": "Individuals who smoke generally do so with the knowledge of potential consequences to their own health. What is rarely considered are the effects of smoking on their future children. The objective of this work was to review the scientific literature on the effects of paternal smoking on sperm and assess the consequences to offspring. A literature search identified over 200 studies with relevant data in humans and animal models. The available data were reviewed to assess the weight of evidence that tobacco smoke is a human germ cell mutagen and estimate effect sizes. These results were used to model the potential increase in genetic disease burden in offspring caused by paternal smoking, with specific focus on aneuploid syndromes and intellectual disability, and the socioeconomic impacts of such an effect. The review revealed strong evidence that tobacco smoking is associated with impaired male fertility, and increases in DNA damage, aneuploidies, and mutations in sperm. Studies support that these effects are heritable and adversely impact the offspring. Our model estimates that, with even a modest 25% increase in sperm mutation frequency caused by smoke-exposure, for each generation across the global population there will be millions of smoking-induced de novo mutations transmitted from fathers to offspring. Furthermore, paternal smoking is estimated to contribute to 1.3 million extra cases of aneuploid pregnancies per generation. Thus, the available evidence makes a compelling case that tobacco smoke is a human germ cell mutagen with serious public health and socio-economic implications. Increased public education should be encouraged to promote abstinence from smoking, well in advance of reproduction, to minimize the transmission of harmful mutations to the next-generation.",

     "abstract": "By definition, telomeric sequences are located at the very ends or terminal regions of chromosomes. However, several vertebrate species show blocks of (TTAGGG)n repeats present in non-terminal regions of chromosomes, the so-called interstitial telomeric sequences (ITSs), interstitial telomeric repeats or interstitial telomeric bands, which include those intrachromosomal telomeric-like repeats located near (pericentromeric ITSs) or within the centromere (centromeric ITSs) and those telomeric repeats located between the centromere and the telomere (i.e., truly interstitial telomeric sequences) of eukaryotic chromosomes. According with their sequence organization, localization and flanking sequences, ITSs can be classified into four types: 1) short ITSs, 2) subtelomeric ITSs, 3) fusion ITSs, and 4) heterochromatic ITSs. The first three types have been described mainly in the human genome, whereas heterochromatic ITSs have been found in several vertebrate species but not in humans.Several lines of evidence suggest that ITSs play a significant role in genome instability and evolution. This review aims to summarize our current knowledge about the origin, function, instability and evolution of these telomeric-like repeats in vertebrate chromosomes.",

     "abstract": "Genetic variants have been reported to cause several genetic diseases. Various genotyping assays have been developed for diagnostic and screening purposes but with certain limitations in sensitivity, specificity, cost effectiveness and/or time savings. Since the discovery of ligase chain reaction (LCR) in the late nineties, it became one of the most favored platforms for detecting these variants and also for genotyping low abundant contaminants. Recent and powerful modifications with the integration of various detection strategies such as electrochemical and magnetic biosensors, nanoparticles (NPs), quantum dots, quartz crystal and leaky surface acoustic surface biosensors, DNAzyme, rolling circle amplification (RCA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), surface enhanced raman scattering (SERS), chemiluminescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer have been introduced to both LCR and ligation based amplifications to enable high-throughput and inexpensive multiplex genotyping with improved robustness, simplicity, sensitivity and specificity. In this article, classical and up to date modifications in LCR and ligation based amplifications are critically evaluated and compared with emphasis on points of strength and weakness, sensitivity, cost, running time, equipment needed, applications and multiplexing potential. Versatile genotyping applications such as genetic diseases detection, bacterial and viral pathogens detection are also detailed. Ligation based gold NPs biosensor, ligation based RCA and ligation mediated SDA assays enhanced detection limit tremendously with a discrimination power approaching 1.5\u00a0aM, 2\u00a0aM and 0.1\u00a0fM respectively. MLPA (multiplexed ligation dependent probe amplification) and SNPlex assays have been commercialized for multiplex detection of at least 48 SNPs at a time. MOL-PCR (multiplex oligonucleotide ligation) has high-throughput capability with multiplex detection of 50 SNPs/well in a 96 well plate. Ligase detection reaction (LDR) is one of the most widely used LCR versions that have been successfully integrated with several detection strategies with improved sensitivity down to 0.4\u00a0fM.",

     "abstract": "Transient and stable vector transfections have played important roles in illustrating the function of specific genes/proteins. The general assumption is that such a platform could effectively link a given gene/protein to gained phenotypes, revealing the mechanism of how a gene works. However, in reality, increased studies have surprisingly noticed some unexpected results. In this review, we demonstrate that an assumption that empty vector-transfected cells preserve the cytogenetic and phenotypic characteristics, and represent the adequate control in transfection experiments is not universally valid. A DNA vector, a transfection reagent, expression of an antibiotic resistance (trans)gene, expression of a reporter (trans)gene, and selection by acute/chronic antibiotic treatment may evoke cellular responses that affect the biochemical processes under investigation. We exemplify a number of studies, which reported obvious genomic, transcriptomic and phenotypic changes of tumor cells after transient/stable transfection of an empty vector. To further address the common mechanisms of these unexpected findings, we will apply the genome theory of somatic evolution to explain stress-mediated system dynamics and the limitations of predicting the system behavior solely based on targeted genes. We conceptualize that the diverse experimental manipulations (e.g., transgene overexpression, gene knock out/down, chemical treatments, acute changes in culture conditions, etc.) may act as a system stress, promoting intensive genome-level alterations (chromosomal instability, CIN), epigenetic and phenotypic alterations, which are beyond the function of manipulated genes. Such analysis calls for more attention on the reduced specificities of gene-focused methodologies.",

     "abstract": "Bystander effects in a biological system are the responses shown by non-targeted neighbouring cells/tissues/organisms. These responses are triggered by factors released from targeted cells when exposed to a stress inducing agent. The biological response to stress inducing agents is complex, owing to the diversity of mechanisms and pathways activated in directly targeted and bystander cells. These responses are highly variable and can be either beneficial or hazardous depending on the cell lines tested, dose of agent used, experimental end points and time course selected. Recently non-targeted cells have even been reported to rescue the directly exposed cells by releasing protective signals that might be induced by non-targeted bystander responses. The nature of bystander signal/s is not yet clear. However, there are evidences suggesting involvement of ROS, RNS, protein factors and even DNA molecules leading to the activation of a number of signaling pathways. These can act independently or in a cascade, to induce events leading to changes in gene expression patterns that could elicit detrimental or beneficial effects.Many review articles on radiation induced bystander responses have been published. However, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive review on bystander responses induced by other genotoxic chemicals and stress inducing agents has not been published so far. Therefore, the aim of the present review is to give an overview of the literature on different aspects of bystander responses: agents that induce these responses, factors that can modulate bystander responses and the mechanisms involved.",

Dysregulation of canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling has been associated with various diseases including cancer. \u03b2-Catenin, the central component of canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is a multi-functional protein playing both structural and signaling roles. \u03b2-Catenin is composed of three distinct domains: N-terminal domain, C-terminal domain and a central armadillo repeat domain. N-terminal domain of \u03b2-catenin harbours almost all of the cancer causing mutations, thus deciphering its critical structural and functional roles offers great potential in cancer detection and therapy. Here, in this review, we have collected information from pharmacological analysis, bio-physical and structural studies, molecular modeling, in-vivo and in-vitro assays, and transgenic animal experiments employing various N-terminal domain variants of \u03b2-catenin to discuss the interaction of \u03b2-catenin with its binding partners that specifically interact with this domain and the implications of these interactions on signaling, cell fate determination, and in tumorigenesis. A thorough understanding of interactions between \u03b2-catenin and its binding partners will enable us to more effectively understand how \u03b2-catenin switches between its multiple roles, and will lead to the development of specific assays for the identification of small molecules as chemotherapeutic agents to treat diseases, including cancer and neurological disorders, where Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is dysregulated.",

We review the application of eight different genotoxicity assays, where the Comet Assay is generally preferred due to its capacity to detect low levels of DNA damage. Most ENPs have been shown to cause genotoxic responses; e.g., DNA or/and chromosomal fragmentation, or DNA strand breakage, but at unrealistic high concentrations. The genotoxicity of the ENPs was dependent on the inherent physico-chemical properties (e.g. size, coating, surface chemistry, e.tc.), and the presence of co-pollutants. To enhance the value of published genotoxicity data, the role of environmental processes; e.g., dissolution, aggregation and agglomeration, and adsorption of ENPs when released in aquatic systems, should be included, and assay protocols must be standardized.

Although this cancer is avoidable, it is the fourth most frequent type of cancer in females worldwide and can only be treated with chemotherapy and radical surgery. There is a need for biomarkers that will enable early diagnosis and targeted therapy for this type of cancer. Therefore, a systems biology pipeline was applied in order to identify potential biomarkers for cervical cancer, which show significant reports in three molecular aspects: DNA sequence variants, DNA methylation pattern and alterations in mRNA/protein expression levels. CDH1, CDKN2A, RB1 and TP53 genes were selected as putative biomarkers, being involved in metastasis, cell cycle regulation and tumour suppression. Other ten genes (CDH13, FHIT, PTEN, MLH1, TP73, CDKN1A, CACNA2D2, TERT, WIF1, APC) seemed to play a role in cervical cancer, but the lack of studies prevented their inclusion as possible biomarkers. Our results highlight the importance of these genes. However, further studies should be performed to elucidate the impact of DNA sequence variants and/or epigenetic deregulation and altered expression of these genes in cervical carcinogenesis and their potential as biomarkers for cervical cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

     "abstract": "DNA mismatch repair (MMR) is an important DNA repair pathway that plays critical roles in DNA replication fidelity, mutation avoidance and genome stability, all of which contribute significantly to the viability of cells and organisms. MMR is widely-used as a diagnostic biomarker for human cancers in the clinic, and as a biomarker of cancer susceptibility in animal model systems. Prokaryotic MMR is well-characterized at the molecular and mechanistic level; however, MMR is considerably more complex in eukaryotic cells than in prokaryotic cells, and in recent years, it has become evident that MMR plays novel roles in eukaryotic cells, several of which are not yet well-defined or understood. Many MMR-deficient human cancer cells lack mutations in known human MMR genes, which strongly suggests that essential eukaryotic MMR components/cofactors remain unidentified and uncharacterized. Furthermore, the mechanism by which the eukaryotic MMR machinery discriminates between the parental (template) and the daughter (nascent) DNA strand is incompletely understood and how cells choose between the EXO1-dependent and the EXO1\u2013independent subpathways of MMR is not known. This review summarizes recent literature on eukaryotic MMR, with emphasis on the diverse cellular roles of eukaryotic MMR proteins, the mechanism of strand discrimination and cross-talk/interactions between and co-regulation of MMR and other DNA repair pathways in eukaryotic cells. The main conclusion of the review is that MMR proteins contribute to genome stability through their ability to recognize and promote an appropriate cellular response to aberrant DNA structures, especially when they arise during DNA replication. Although the molecular mechanism of MMR in the eukaryotic cell is still not completely understood, increased used of single-molecule analyses in the future may yield new insight into these unsolved questions.",

     "abstract": "The human population is continually exposed to numerous harmful environmental stressors, causing negative health effects and/or deregulation of biomarker levels. However, studies reporting no or even positive impacts of some stressors on humans are also sometimes published. The main aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the last decade of Czech biomonitoring research, concerning the effect of various levels of air pollution (benzo[a]pyrene) and radiation (uranium, X-ray examination and natural radon background), on the differently exposed population groups. Because some results obtained from cytogenetic studies were opposite than hypothesized, we have searched for a meaningful interpretation in genomic/epigenetic studies.A detailed analysis of our data supported by the studies of others and current epigenetic knowledge, leads to a hypothesis of the versatile mechanism of adaptation to environmental stressors via DNA methylation settings which may even originate in prenatal development, and help to reduce the resulting DNA damage levels. This hypothesis is fully in agreement with unexpected data from our studies (e.g. lower levels of DNA damage in subjects from highly polluted regions than in controls or in subjects exposed repeatedly to a pollutant than in those without previous exposure), and is also supported by differences in DNA methylation patterns in groups from regions with various levels of pollution.In light of the adaptation hypothesis, the following points may be suggested for future research: (i) the chronic and acute exposure of study subjects should be distinguished; (ii) the exposure history should be mapped including place of residence during the life and prenatal development; (iii) changes of epigenetic markers should be monitored over time.In summary, investigation of human adaptation to the environment, one of the most important processes of survival, is a new challenge for future research in the field of human biomonitoring that may change our view on the results of biomarker analyses and potential negative health impacts of the environment.",

     "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of cancer consists in the ability of tumor cells to divide indefinitely, and to maintain stable telomere lengths throughout the activation of specific telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMM). Therefore in the last fifteen years, researchers proposed to target telomerase or telomeric structure in order to block limitless replicative potential of cancer cells providing a fascinating strategy for a broad-spectrum cancer therapy.In the present review, we report in vitro and in vivo evidence regarding the use of chemical agents targeting both telomerase or telomere structure and showing promising antitumor effects when used in combination with ionizing radiation (IR). RNA interference, antisense oligonucleotides (e.g., GRN163L), non-nucleoside inhibitors (e.g., BIBR1532) and nucleoside analogs (e.g., AZT) represent some of the most potent strategies to inhibit telomerase activity used in combination with IR. Furthermore, radiosensitizing effects were demonstrated also for agents acting directly on the telomeric structure such as G4-ligands (e.g., RHPS4 and Telomestatin) or telomeric-oligos (T-oligos). To date, some of these compounds are under clinical evaluation (e.g., GRN163L and KML001).Advantages of Telomere/Telomerase Targeting Compounds (T/TTCs) coupled with radiotherapy may be relevant in the treatment of radioresistant tumors and in the development of new optimized treatment plans with reduced dose adsorbed by patients and consequent attenuation of short- end long-term side effects. Pros and cons of possible future applications in cancer therapy based on the combination of T/TCCs and radiation treatment are discussed.",

Short life span, easy maintenance, production of large number of offspring in a single generation and the tissues with appropriate cell populations make these flies ideal for studies associated to developmental biology, diseases, genetics, genetic toxicology and stress biology in the group. Moreover, their cosmopolitan presence makes them suitable candidate for ecological bio-monitoring. An attempt has been made in the present review to reveal the significance of dipteran flies for assessing alterations in genetic content through various genotoxicity biomarkers and to summarize the gradual advancement in these studies. Recent studies on genotoxicity assays in dipterans have opened up a broader perspective for DNA repair related mechanistic studies, pre-screening of chemicals and environmental bio-monitoring. Studies in dipterans, other than Drosophila may be helpful in using them as an alternative model system for assessment of genotoxicity, especially at the gene level and further extension of these studies give a future insight to develop new strategies for maintaining environment friendly limits of the toxicants.",

     "abstract": "DNA mutations of various types often affect the cellular localization and function of gene products. The role of mutant transcripts in the pathogenesis of human disease is increasingly recognized. Among the pathogenic RNA variants are transcripts with single nucleotide substitutions, small insertions or deletions, aberrantly or alternatively spliced transcripts and RNAs derived from fused genes. To discriminate among transcripts, particularly those of low abundance, showing small or large sequence differences, a highly sensitive and specific RNA imaging method is required. The method that fulfills these criteria is single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (smFISH) combined with probes discriminating among RNA variants. With this method, RNA transcripts produced from individual alleles can be imaged, and differences in their transcription, processing, cellular localization and decay can be revealed. In addition to its applications for studying physiological processes involving RNA variants, smFISH offers several advantages for disease related mutation research. Further development of allele-specific microscopic methods may broaden group of RNA variants analyzed, including RNAs with expanded repeat tract, different variants of 3\u2032UTR, RNAs differing in length of polyA tract or transcripts produced from alternative start codons. Moreover, first attempts for allele-specific RNA live imaging were made adding time-lapse analysis. In this review, we discuss important aspects of the variant-specific smFISH methodology and present examples of its applications in deciphering RNA-mediated pathogenic mechanisms in a variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurological, immunological and cardiovascular diseases.",

Taking into account constant competitiveness in the quickly developing biomedical sciences and the availability of sophisticated techniques, the choice and establishment of an experimental model system are essential for a successful research project. Currently, various sophisticated in vitro and in vivo models are being designed and developed in order to replace the use of mammalian models to investigate the mechanisms of action, activity and properties of novel compounds or treatment modalities. After the clinical success of photodynamic therapy (PDT) used against neovascular eye disorders, clinically approved PDT protocols for cancer are still being developed. Since several aspects of PDT should be examined, it is crucial to define the possible models that would guide the principle of the 3Rs (Reduction, Refinement, Replacement) practice, which is known as the fundamental strategy for designing more ethical animal studies. This review is focused on the usefulness of alternative in vivo as well as in vitro models to study important aspects of PDT, especially in the context of cancer research. 3D human-relevant cell culture models, followed by non-mammalian models such as the nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans), fly (Drosophila melanogaster), zebrafish (Danio rerio), frog (Xenopus laevis), or chicken chorioallantoic membrane (Gallus gallus), are discussed as an alternative to the widely used but ethically controversial mammalian models.",

     "abstract": "Alternative splicing (AS) linked to diseases, especially to tumors. Recently, more and more studies focused on the relationship between AS and gastric cancer (GC). This review surveyed the hot topic from four aspects: First, the common types of AS in cancer, including exon skipping, intron retention, mutually exclusive exon, alternative 5 ' or 3\u2032 splice site, alternative first or last exon and alternative 3\u2032 untranslated regions. Second, basic mechanisms of AS and its relationship with cancer. RNA splicing in eukaryotes follows the GT-AG rule by both cis-elements and trans-acting factors regulatory. Through RNA splicing, different proteins with different forms and functions can be produced and may be associated with carcinogenesis. Third, AS types of GC-related genes and their splicing variants. In this paper, we listed 10 common genes with AS and illustrated its possible molecular mechanisms owing to genetic variation (mutation and /or polymorphism). Fourth, the splicing variants of GC-associated genes and gastric carcinogenesis, invasion and metastasis. Many studies have found that the different splicing variants of the same gene are differentially expressed in GC and its precancerous diseases, suggesting AS has important implications in GC development. Taking together, this review highlighted the role of AS and splicing variants in the process of GC. We hope that this is not only beneficial to advances in the study field of GC, but also can provide valuable information to other similar tumor research.Although we already know some gene splicing and splicing variants play an important role in the development of GC, but many phenomena and mechanisms are still unknown. For example, how the tumor microenvironment and signal transduction pathway effect the forming and function of AS? Unfortunately, this review did not cover the contents because the current study is limited. It is no doubt that clarifying the phenomena and mechanisms of these unknown may help to reveal the relationship of AS with complex tumor genetic variation and the occurrence and development of tumors.",

What is less well known, however, is that this NTP program had its origin in two separate testing programs that were initiated independently at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) before the NTP was established. The NCI program was in response to the 1971 National Cancer Act which dramatically increased the NCI budget. In contrast, the NIEHS testing program can be traced back to a publication by Bruce Ames, not the one describing the mutagenicity assay he developed that became known as the Ames test, but because in 1975 he published an article showing that hair dyes were mutagenic. The protocols developed for these NCI contracts became the basis for the NTP Salmonella testing contracts that were awarded a few years later. These protocols, with their supporting NTP data, strongly influenced the initial in vitro OECD Test Guidelines. The background and evolution of the NTP genetic toxicity testing program is described, along with some of the more significant milestone discoveries and accomplishments from this program.",

Although the available HPV vaccines are extremely successful, approximately 15 additional cancer-causing HPVs have been identified that the vaccines do not protect against. Therefore, roughly 150,000 cancer cases will not be prevented annually with the current vaccines. Research efforts focused on the basic cell biology of HPV infection have a goal of identifying common infectious events that may lead to inexpensive vaccines or anti-virals to prevent infection by most, if not all, HPVs.

Two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, are essential for the development and maintenance of malignancy. Both proteins function by targeting critical pathways that are essential for maintaining cellular homeostasis. As a consequence of these activities, this produces an environment that is favourable for the normal viral life cycle, but when perturbed, can result in the initiation of changes to the host cell, which ultimately results in the development of a malignancy. In this review we discuss the role of these different functions of the viral oncoproteins during the viral life cycle and carcinogenesis, with an emphasis on how induction of DNA damage by the viral oncoproteins, in conjunction with the stem like nature of the target cells, can ultimately result in the development of cancer.",

Today, over 200 types of human papillomaviruses are known. They are divided into low-risk and high-risk HPVs depending on their potential to induce carcinogenesis, driven by two major viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7. By interacting with cellular partners, these proteins are involved in interdependent viral and cell cycles in stratified differentiating epithelium, and concomitantly induce epigenetic changes in infected cells and those undergoing malignant transformation. E6 and E7 oncoproteins interact with and/or modulate expression of many proteins involved in epigenetic regulation, including DNA methyltransferases, histone-modifying enzymes and subunits of chromatin remodeling complexes, thereby influencing host cell transcription program. Furthermore, HPV oncoproteins modulate expression of cellular micro RNAs. Most of these epigenetic actions in a complex dynamic interplay participate in the maintenance of persistent infection, cell transformation, and development of invasive cancer by a considerable deregulation of tumor suppressor and oncogenes. In this study, we have undertaken to discuss a number of studies concerning epigenetic regulations in HPV-dependent cells and to focus on those that have biological relevance to cancer progression.",

     "abstract": "Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are widespread DNA viruses that can infect epithelial cells of the skin and mucosa. Most HPV infections remain clinically unapparent and clear spontaneously. In few cases, however, HPV infections persist and can cause benign and malignant neoplasms at different anatomic locations. Malignant HPV-induced neoplasms are caused by distinct types of HPV (oncogenic or high-risk (HR) HPV types) and present in the anogenital (anus, penis, uterine cervix, vagina and vulva) and head and neck (particularly oropharynx) region. In the anogenital region defined precancerous stages precede invasive cancer. In the head and neck region there is clear evidence only for the invasive stage of HPV-induced neoplasia. In early infection stages the HPV oncogenes (E6/E7) are under tight control in the basal and parabasal cell layers. In more advanced precancerous stages increased expression of the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 occurs (transforming infection) that may result in transformation of these cells. The defined carcinogenesis in the anogenital tract enables cancer early detection, particularly at the uterine cervix where cytologic and molecular tests contribute to early diagnosis and treatment at a non-invasive stage. Up to now, the treatment of HPV-related precancerous stages (high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia) and cancer is not specifically targeting molecular characteristics of the virus.

Investigative hypotheses in original studies were based on biological functions manifested by the entire family of IGF (ligands, receptors, linking proteins, adaptor molecules).In the context of carcinogenesis the most important functions of IGF family involve intensification of proliferation and inhibition of cell apoptosis and effect on cell transformation through synthesis of several regulatory proteins. IGF axis controls survival and influences on metastases of cells. Interactions of IGF axis components may be of a direct or indirect nature. The direct effects are linked to activation of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, in which the initiating role is first of all played by IGF-1 and IGF-1R. Activity of this signaling pathway leads to an increased mitogenesis, cell cycle progression, and protection against different apoptotic stresses. Indirect effects of the axis depend on interactions between IGF and other molecules important for cancer etiology (e.g. sex hormones, products of suppressor genes, viruses, and other GFs) and the style of life (nutrition, physical activity). From the clinical point of view, components of IGF system are first of all considered as diagnostic serous and/or tissue biomarkers of a given cancer, prognostic factors and attractive target of modern anti-tumor therapies. Several mechanisms in which IGF system components act in the process of carcinogenesis need to be clarified, mainly due to multifactorial etiology of the neoplasms. Pin-pointing of the role played in carcinogenesis by any single signaling pathway remains particularly difficult.The aim of this review is to summarize the current data of several epidemiological studies, experiments in vitro and on animal models, to increase our understanding of the complex role of IGF family components in the most common human cancers.",

The current focus for cancer therapeutic approaches have shifted from the conventional treatments towards the targeted therapies and the IGF system has gained a great interest as anti-cancer therapy. The proliferative, anti-apoptotic and transformation effects of IGFs are mainly triggered by the ligation of the type I IGF receptor (IGF-IR). Thus, aiming at developing novel and effective cancer therapies, different strategies have been employed to target IGF system in human malignancies, including but not limited to ligand or receptor neutralizing antibodies and IGF-IR signaling inhibitors. In this review, we have focused on the clinical studies that have been conducted targeting the various components of the IGF system for the treatment of different types of cancer, providing a description and the challenges of each targeting strategy and the degree of success.",

     "abstract": "It has been suggested that long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) gene polymorphisms are associated with cancer risk. In this article, we conducted a systematic review related to studies on the association between lncRNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the overall risk of cancer. A total 17 SNPs in four common lncRNA genes were included in the meta-analysis. In the lncRNA H19, the rs2735971 A/G, rs2839698C/T, and rs3024270 G/C polymorphisms, but not rs217727C/T, were correlated with overall cancer risk. The results also suggested that other SNPs were correlated with overall cancer risk, namely, two in HOTAIR (HOX transcript antisense RNA: rs920778C/T and rs7958904 G/C) and two in PRNCR1 (rs1016343C/T and rs16901946 A/G). No association was found between the three ZNRD1-AS1 (ZNRD1 antisense RNA 1) SNPs and the risk of cancer. In summary, our findings suggest that quite a few studied lncRNA SNPs are associated with overall cancer risk; therefore, they are potential predictive biomarkers for the risk of cancer. Moreover, other lncRNA SNPs investigated were also relevant to cancer but studies on them are limited, and they were also briefly reviewed as candidate cancer markers.",

     "abstract": "Telomere repeats at chromosomal ends, critical to genome integrity, are maintained through an elaborate network of proteins and pathways. Shelterin complex proteins shield telomeres from induction of DNA damage response to overcome end protection problem. A specialized ribonucleic protein, telomerase, maintains telomere homeostasis through repeat addition to counter intrinsic shortcomings of DNA replication that leads to gradual sequence shortening in successive mitoses. The biogenesis and recruitment of telomerase composed of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) subunit and an RNA component, takes place through the intricate machinery that involves an elaborate number of molecules. The synthesis of telomeres remains a controlled and limited process. Inherited mutations in the molecules involved in the process directly or indirectly cause telomeropathies. Telomerase, while present in stem cells, is deactivated due to epigenetic silencing of the rate-limiting TERT upon differentiation in most of somatic cells with a few exceptions. However, in most of the cancer cells telomerase reactivation remains a ubiquitous process and constitutes one of the major hallmarks. Discovery of mutations within the core promoter of the TERT gene that create de novo binding sites for E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factors provided a mechanism for cancer-specific telomerase reactivation. The TERT promoter mutations occur mainly in tumors from tissues with low rates of self-renewal. In melanoma, glioma, hepatocellular carcinoma, urothelial carcinoma and others, the promoter mutations have been shown to define subsets of patients with adverse disease outcomes, associate with increased transcription of TERT, telomerase reactivation and affect telomere length; in stem cells the mutations inhibit TERT silencing following differentiation into adult cells. The TERT promoter mutations cause an epigenetic switch on the mutant allele along with recruitment of pol II following the binding of GABPA/B1 complex that leads to mono-allelic expression. Thus, the TERT promoter mutations hold potential as biomarkers as well as future therapeutic targets.",

     "abstract": "Although platinum-based chemotherapy remains the standard treatment for advanced NSCLC patients, clinical outcomes are poor and most patients develop high-grade toxicities. Genetic factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in platinum pharmacodynamics, metabolism and mechanism of action, may account for inter-individual differences shown in effectiveness and toxicity. Polymorphisms in genes involved in DNA repair and others such as PI3K/PTEN/AKT and TGF-\u03b2 pathways have been demonstrated to be associated with response, survival and toxicity in advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Other cellular processes, like DNA methylation and proliferation have been connected with clinical outcome for platinum-based chemotherapy regimens through folate metabolism and cytokine signaling.The influence of gene polymorphisms in the NER pathway on clinical outcome has been extensively investigated in advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy but contradictory results have been reported. The most recent and thorough meta-analyses have failed to show an association between ERCC1 C118T/C8092A and ERCC5 rs1047768 polymorphisms and response to platinum based chemotherapy. However, other polymorphisms in ERCC2 (Lys751Gln and Asp312Asn) and ERCC5 (rs2094258 and rs2296147) and have been related with overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS), respectively. The Arg194Trp and Gln399Arg polymorphisms in XRCC1, have also been extensively investigated. Their effects seem to be dependent on ethnicity, and recent meta-analyses have confirmed an association with response in Asian but not in Caucasian patients. The influence on overall response rate (ORR) of the rs861539 polymorphism in XRCC3, part of (DSB) repair pathway, has also been confirmed in a meta-analysis.Finally, SNPs in genes coding proteins of the p53, PI3K, TGF-\u03b2, membrane transporters, gluthatione metabolism enzymes and cytokine pathways have been less extensively investigated. Some polymorphisms have been reported to be associated with toxicity or clinical outcome, but data generally come from a limited number of studies and need to be confirmed.",

     "abstract": "Recent epidemiology studies highlighted the detrimental health effects of exposure to low dose and low dose rate ionizing radiation (IR): nuclear industry workers studies have shown increased leukaemia and solid tumour risks following cumulative doses of <100\u00a0mSv and dose rates of <10\u00a0mGy per year; paediatric patients studies have reported increased leukaemia and brain tumours risks after doses of 30\u201360\u00a0mGy from computed tomography scans. Questions arise, however, about the impact of even lower doses and dose rates where classical epidemiological studies have limited power but where subsets within the large cohorts are expected to have an increased risk. Further progress requires integration of biomarkers or bioassays of individual exposure, effects and susceptibility to IR. The European DoReMi (Low Dose Research towards Multidisciplinary Integration) consortium previously reviewed biomarkers for potential use in IR epidemiological studies. Given the increased mechanistic understanding of responses to low dose radiation the current review provides an update covering technical advances and recent studies. A key issue identified is deciding which biomarkers to progress. A roadmap is provided for biomarker development from discovery to implementation and used to summarise the current status of proposed biomarkers for epidemiological studies. Most potential biomarkers remain at the discovery stage and for some there is sufficient evidence that further development is not warranted. One biomarker identified in the final stages of development and as a priority for further research is radiation specific mRNA transcript profiles.",

     "abstract": "The present review describes available evidence about the fate of micronuclei and micronucleated cells. Micronuclei are small, extranuclear chromatin bodies surrounded by a nuclear envelope. The mechanisms underlying the formation of micronuclei are well understood but not much is known about the potential fate of micronuclei and micronucleated cells. Many studies with different experimental approaches addressed the various aspects of the post-mitotic fate of micronuclei and micronucleated cells. These studies are reviewed here considering four basic possibilities for potential fates of micronuclei: degradation of the micronucleus or the micronucleated cell, reincorporation into the main nucleus, extrusion from the cell, and persistence in the cytoplasm. Two additional fates need to be considered: premature chromosome condensation/chromothripsis and the elimination of micronucleated cells by apoptosis, yielding six potential fates for micronuclei and/or micronucleated cells. The available data is still limited, but it can be concluded that degradation and extrusion of micronuclei might occur in rare cases under specific conditions, reincorporation during the next mitosis occurs more frequently, and the majority of the micronuclei persist without alteration at least until the next mitosis, possibly much longer. Overall, the consequences of micronucleus formation on the cellular level are still far from clear, but they should be investigated further because micronucleus formation may contribute to the initial and later steps of malignant cell transformation, by causing gain or loss of genetic material in the daughter cells and by the possibility of massive chromosome rearrangement in chromosomes entrapped within a micronucleus by the mechanisms of chromothripsis and chromoanagenesis.",

     "abstract": "Endogenous and exogenous reactive species cause oxidatively induced DNA damage in living organisms by a variety of mechanisms. As a result, a plethora of mutagenic and/or cytotoxic products are formed in cellular DNA. This type of DNA damage is repaired by base excision repair, although nucleotide excision repair also plays a limited role. DNA glycosylases remove modified DNA bases from DNA by hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond leaving behind an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site. Some of them also possess an accompanying AP-lyase activity that cleaves the sugar-phosphate chain of DNA. Since the first discovery of a DNA glycosylase, many studies have elucidated the mechanisms of action, substrate specificities and excision kinetics of these enzymes present in all living organisms. For this purpose, most studies used single- or double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides with a single DNA lesion embedded at a defined position. High-molecular weight DNA with multiple base lesions has been used in other studies with the advantage of the simultaneous investigation of many DNA base lesions as substrates. Differences between the substrate specificities and excision kinetics of DNA glycosylases have been found when these two different substrates were used. Some DNA glycosylases possess varying substrate specificities for either purine-derived lesions or pyrimidine-derived lesions, whereas others exhibit cross-activity for both types of lesions. Laboratory animals with knockouts of the genes of DNA glycosylases have also been used to provide unequivocal evidence for the substrates, which had previously been found in in vitro studies, to be the actual substrates in vivo as well. On the basis of the knowledge gained from the past studies, efforts are being made to discover small molecule inhibitors of DNA glycosylases that may be used as potential drugs in cancer therapy.",

     "abstract": "Scientific disputes are commonly presented and settled in journal publications. Most are resolved by a weighing of evidence and new findings. In some cases the arguments are personal and in the form of ad hominem attacks on the personality or integrity of an author of a journal article. Many famous scientists (e.g., Galileo, Newton, and Hooke) used ad hominem arguments in responding to their critics. William Bateson, W.F.R. Weldon, William Castle, and H.J. Muller used ad hominem arguments in their publications until the end of World War I, when editorial policy of journals changed. Motivating some of the attacks are philosophic differences (such as holistic or reductionist approaches to science), ideological differences (such as Marxist or Capitalist outlooks), politics (such as Cold War depictions by East and West on fallout from nuclear testing), or conflicts of interest (which can be professional or financial such as the debates over nontraditional and orthodox medicine or over tobacco smoking and health). Most of the time, the disputes are motivated by honest disagreements over the interpretation of the data. A recent surge (2009\u20132016) of ad hominem attacks by Edward Calabrese has appeared disparaging H. J. Muller, E. B. Lewis, other twentieth-century contributors to radiation genetics, and the National Academy of Sciences. They address the mutational effects of low-dose radiation exposure. Calabrese\u2019s attacks have led to responses by geneticists in the field of mutagenesis, by agencies criticized by Calabrese, and by students and colleagues of those who have been accused of deception by Calabrese. This article reviews some of the history of ad hominem arguments in science and the background to the attacks by Calabrese. I argue that Calabrese\u2019s characterization of Muller and his supporters is unjust, misleading, and hurtful. I also propose some methods for dealing with or preventing ad hominem attacks in professional journals.",

     "abstract": "Epidemiological studies on the atomic-bomb survivors, cancer survivors and occupational cohorts provide strong evidence for multifaceted damage to brain after ionizing radiation. Radiation-induced late effects may manifest as brain tumors or cognitive impairment. Decreased neurogenesis and differentiation, alteration in neural structure and synaptic plasticity as well as increased oxidative stress and inflammation are suggested to contribute to adverse effects in the brain. In addition to neural stems cells, several brain-specific mature cell types including endothelial and glial cells are negatively affected by ionizing radiation. Radiation-induced enhancement of endothelial cell apoptosis results in disruption of the vascular system and the blood brain barrier. Activated microglia create inflammatory environment that negatively affects neuronal structures and results in decreased synaptic plasticity. Although the molecular mechanisms involved in radiation-induced brain injury remain elusive, first strategies for prevention and amelioration are being developed. Drug-based prevention and treatment focus mainly on the inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammation.

     "abstract": "In its 2012 report on tissue reactions, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) made several key assumptions regarding radiation risk to the lens of the eye, including that radiation-related minor opacities will progress to become vision-impairing cataracts, that protracted irradiation confers as much risk per unit dose as an acute exposure, and that there is a dose threshold for cataract effects at about 0.5\u00a0Gy. The few studies available provide only limited support for the ICRP assumption that radiation-related minor opacities are predictive of vision-impairing cataracts; further longitudinal data are clearly needed. In keeping with the ICRP assumption, there is currently no compelling evidence for diminished cataractogenic effects at low dose rates, i.e., the data are compatible with a dose-rate effectiveness factor (DREF) of unity but the uncertainties are large enough that other values of DREF cannot be ruled out. Most available epidemiologic data suggest there is a dose threshold somewhere between several hundred mGy and one Gy for lens opacities. The new studies of medical and occupational exposures that have evaluated groups with low doses tend to confirm there is little or no excess risk at doses under 100\u00a0mGy, while new studies of interventional cardiologist personnel who often have substantial doses to the lens of the eye have shown elevated opacity risks. Thus occupations that have high lens doses should receive remedial attention to prevent lens opacity risk.",

     "abstract": "The lens of the eye has long been considered as a radiosensitive tissue, but recent research has suggested that the radiosensitivity is even greater than previously thought. The 2012 recommendation of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) to substantially reduce the annual occupational equivalent dose limit for the ocular lens has now been adopted in the European Union and is under consideration around the rest of the world. However, ICRP clearly states that the recommendations are chiefly based on epidemiological evidence because there are a very small number of studies that provide explicit biological, mechanistic evidence at doses <2\u00a0Gy. This paper aims to present a review of recently published information on the biological and mechanistic aspects of cataracts induced by exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). The data were compiled by assessing the pertinent literature in several distinct areas which contribute to the understanding of IR induced cataracts, information regarding lens biology and general processes of cataractogenesis. Results from cellular and tissue level studies and animal models, and relevant human studies, were examined. The main focus was the biological effects of low linear energy transfer IR, but dosimetry issues and a number of other confounding factors were also considered. The results of this review clearly highlight a number of gaps in current knowledge. Overall, while there have been a number of recent advances in understanding, it remains unknown exactly how IR exposure contributes to opacification. A fuller understanding of how exposure to relatively low doses of IR promotes induction and/or progression of IR-induced cataracts will have important implications for prevention and treatment of this disease, as well as for the field of radiation protection.",

     "abstract": "Biological effectiveness of ionizing radiation differs with its linear energy transfer (LET) such that high-LET radiation is more effective for various biological endpoints than low-LET radiation. Human exposure to high-LET radiation occurs in cancer patients, nuclear workers, aviators, astronauts and other space travellers. From the radiation protection viewpoint, the ocular lens is among the most radiosensitive tissues in the body, and cataract (a clouding of the normally transparent lens) is classified as tissue reactions (formerly called nonstochastic or deterministic effects) with a threshold below which no effect would occur. To prevent radiation cataracts, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has recommended an equivalent dose limit for the lens according to the threshold for vision-impairing cataracts. ICRP recommended the threshold of >8\u00a0Gy in 1984 and an occupational dose limit of 150\u00a0mSv/year in 1980. These remained unchanged until 2011, when ICRP recommended lowering the threshold to 0.5\u00a0Gy and the dose limit to 20\u00a0mSv/year (averaged over 5 years with no single year exceeding 50\u00a0mSv). Although such reduction of the threshold was based on findings from low-LET radiation, the dose limit was recommended in Sv. Historically, the lens is the exceptional tissue for which ICRP had assigned a special factor in addition to a general radiation weighting factor, predicated on a belief that the lens is more vulnerable to high-LET radiation than other tissues. Considering such radiosensitive nature of the lens, a deeper understanding of a cataractogenic potential of high-LET radiation is indispensable. This review is thus designed to provide an update on the current knowledge as to high-LET radiation cataractogenesis. To this end, changes in ICRP recommendations on lenticular radiation protection, epidemiological and biological findings on high-LET cataractogenesis are reviewed, and future research needs are then discussed.",

     "abstract": "Radiotherapy is one of the most effective treatment strategies for solid malignancies, including head-and-neck tumors (HNT). Oral mucositis is the most frequent, often dose-limiting early adverse event of radio(chemo)therapy for HNT. The oral mucosal response is \u2013 like that of typical turnover tissues \u2013 based on radiation-induced impairment of epithelial proliferation and cell production, in face of ongoing physiological cell differentiation and cell loss, consequently resulting in hypoplasia and eventually mucosal ulceration. The regenerative epithelial response, i.e. repopulation, and hence the impact of overall treatment time, besides intrinsic radiosensitivity, is the dominant parameter of the radiation tolerance of oral mucosa in fractionated radiotherapy protocols.The epithelial changes are accompanied, at the molecular and cellular level, by various changes in non-epithelial cell populations, i.e. vascular endothelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts. An inflammatory response precedes and parallels the epithelial changes; this includes vasodilation associated with rheological consequences and the manifestation of local hypoxia, activation of macrophages and endothelial cells. During these processes, a variety of intra- and intercellular communication pathways are modulated; NF-\u03baB associated signaling is one prominent example. The interactions of these extra-epithelial changes with epithelial hypoplasia, ulceration and regeneration currently remain largely unclear. Research on the molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical manifestation of oral mucositis will allow for identification of potential early biomarkers of oral mucosal morbidity and thus for individualization of patient follow-up and treatment, and also for the development of targeted strategies for prophylaxis and/or mitigation of oral mucositis.This review summarizes the features of the clinical manifestation of oral mucositis and its consequences, the \u201cclassical\u201d radiobiological parameters of mucosal radiation sensitivity. It moreover focuses on the underlying \u201cmolecular\u201d mechanisms, and on biology-based approaches for the amelioration of radiation-induced oral mucositis.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to therapeutic doses of ionizing radiation is associated with damage to the heart and coronary arteries. However, only recently have studies with high-quality individual dosimetry data allowed this risk to be quantified while also adjusting for concomitant chemotherapy, and medical and lifestyle risk factors. At lower levels of exposure the evidence is less clear. In this article I review radiation-associated risks of circulatory disease in groups treated with radiotherapy for malignant and non-malignant disease, and in occupationally- or environmentally-exposed groups receiving rather lower levels of radiation dose, also for medical diagnostic purposes.Results of a meta-analysis suggest that excess relative risks per unit dose for various types of heart disease do not exhibit statistically significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.2) heterogeneity between studies. Although there are no marked discrepancies between risks derived from the high-dose therapeutic and medical diagnostic studies and from the moderate/low dose occupational and environmental studies, at least for ischemic heart disease and stroke there are indications of larger risks per unit dose for lower dose rate and fractionated exposures. Risks for stroke and other types of circulatory disease are significantly more variable (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), possibly resulting from confounding and effect-modification by well known (but unobserved) risk factors. Adjustment for any of mean dose, dose fractionation or age at exposure results in the residual heterogeneity for cerebrovascular disease becoming non-significant. The review provides strong evidence in support of a causal association between both low and high dose radiation exposure and most types of circulatory disease.",

Clinical studies have identified early and late manifestations of radiation-induced heart disease, a side effect of radiation therapy to tumors in the chest when all or part of the heart is situated in the radiation field. Studies in preclinical animal models have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms by which radiation may injure the heart. More recent observations in human subjects suggest that ionizing radiation may have cardiovascular effects at lower doses than was previously thought. This has led to examinations of low-dose photons and low-dose charged particle irradiation in animal models. Lastly, studies have started to identify non-invasive methods for detection of cardiac radiation injury and interventions that may prevent or mitigate these adverse effects. Altogether, this ongoing research should increase our knowledge of biological mechanisms of cardiovascular radiation injury, identify non-invasive biomarkers for early detection, and potential interventions that may prevent or mitigate these adverse effects.",

     "abstract": "The response of the intestine to (low linear-energy-transfer) ionising radiation is reviewed regarding the cellular basis to the reactions, the regenerative processes which restore the tissue, and external agents which aid its recovery. In the steady-state, it is generally considered that the crypt cell lineages in both small and large intestine are maintained by a small number of stem cells, but there are differences for example in the composition of their niche residence and in the numbers of transit cell generations. Various cell surface markers are now available to indentify particular lineage cell types. Radiation doses up to 1\u00a0Gy cause apoptotic stem-cell death in particular locations, at higher doses to >6\u00a0Gy Lgr5+ stem cells are required for normal intestinal recovery, and at >8\u00a0Gy some crypts are sterilised and the probability of animal death from intestinal injury increases with higher doses. Mutations in repair genes, tumour suppressor genes, and survival genes cause various degrees of stem cell and clonogenic cell radiosensitisation. Recent evidence is suggesting much plasticity in the crypt cell lineage, potentially contributing to flexibility in the hierarchical lineage, clonogen number variations and the sensitisation differences. Knockout mice for many different genes have been used to detect their role in both steady state and in irradiated conditions, expected to lead to further insight to the damage and restorative processes. Many different external agents have been used to ameliorate intestinal reactions, including prostaglandins, interleukins, angiogenic and epithelial growth factors, other cytokines, and intraluminal factors.",

In differentiating spermatogenic cells, the genomic instability is limited in time, whereas in spermatogonial stem cells it can be maintained all along life. Spermatogonial stem cells are long-lived cells that support normal germ cell differentiation and must be preserved throughout life. However after irradiation spermatogenesis recovery can be impaired as a consequence of the radiation-induced decline in spermatogonial stem cell. In this review, we summarize the differential sensitivities to DNA damage of spermatogenic cell populations, and the DNA repair mechanisms activated in these cells that paradoxically might favour the maintenance of cells with impaired genomic integrity. We describe how the testis tissue collapses in response to irradiation and we discuss the molecular pathways involved in the control of DNA damage response and homeostasis in spermatogonial stem cells.",

     "abstract": "In human skin, keratinopoiesis is based on a functional hierarchy among keratinocytes, with rare slow-cycling stem cells responsible for the long-term maintenance of the tissue through their self-renewal potential, and more differentiated daughter progenitor cells actively cycling to permit epidermal renewal and turn-over every month. Skin is a radio-responsive tissue, developing all types of radiation damage and pathologies, including early tissue reactions such as dysplasia and denudation in epidermis, and later fibrosis in the dermis and acanthosis in epidermis, with the TGF-beta 1 pathway as a known master switch. Also there is a risk of basal cell carcinoma, which arises from epidermal keratinocytes, notably after oncogenic events in PTCH1 or TP53 genes. This review will cover the mechanisms of adverse human skin reactions and carcinogenesis after various types of exposures to ionizing radiation, with comparison with animal data when necessary, and will discuss the possible role of stem cells and their progeny in the development of these disorders. The main endpoints presented are basal cell intrinsic radiosensitivity, genomic stability, individual factors of risk, dose specific responses, major molecular pathways involved and the cellular origin of skin reactions and cancer. Although major advances have been obtained in recent years, the precise implications of epidermal stem cells and their progeny in these processes are not yet fully characterized.",

     "abstract": "The human response to ionizing radiation (IR) varies among individuals. The first evidence of the individual response to IR was reported in the beginning of the 20th century. Considering nearly one century of observations, we here propose three aspects of individual IR response: radiosensitivity for early or late adverse tissue events after radiotherapy on normal tissues (non-cancer effects attributable to cell death); radiosusceptibility for IR-induced cancers; and radiodegeneration for non-cancer effects that are often attributable to mechanisms other than cell death (e.g., cataracts and circulatory disease). All the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind IR-induced individual effects are not fully elucidated. However, some specific assays may help their quantification according to the dose and to the genetic status. Accumulated data on individual factors have suggested that the individual IR response cannot be ignored and raises some clinical and societal issues. The individual IR response therefore needs to be taken into account to better evaluate the risks related to IR exposure.",

     "abstract": "This article concerns the use of the lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay in biomonitoring of occupational and environmental exposures to genotoxic agents. Furthermore, we evaluated the use of this method in different exposure scenarios, in comparison to other DNA damage biomarkers and its regional distribution. So far ca. 400 studies have been published and the number increased substantially in the last years. The most frequently investigated groups are hospital personnel, followed by workers in the chemical industry and agricultural workers. The lymphocyte CBMN assay is more frequently used in occupational studies than MN assays with epithelial cells and other methods, such as chromosomal aberration analyses, Comet assay and DNA-adduct measurements. The use of probes which enable the discrimination between MN containing chromosome fragments and whole chromosomes allows the identification of the molecular mechanisms of MN formation. Most studies were performed in Europe and Asia (ca. 65% and 25%, respectively). Important future developments will be the evaluation of the biological consequences of formation of additional nuclear endpoints (e.g. nucleoplasmic bridges), the improvement of the understanding of the health consequences of their formation, and the use of automated scoring devices. Future applications of the CBMN assay should address new emerging problems, e.g. the potential genotoxic damage induced by the use of nanoparticles and mobile phones. The control of occupational exposures to chemical genotoxins is currently based on chemical measurements which do not reflect interactions of individual factors and the inclusion of the lymphocyte CBMN assay in routine surveillance of workers could contribute substantially to the prevention of adverse health effects.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to summarise current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms by which in vivo exposure to exogenous chemical genotoxins in humans induces micronuclei (MNi) and other nuclear anomalies in lymphocytes in vivo and ex vivo after nuclear division in vitro. MNi originate from acentric chromosome fragments and/or whole chromosomes that are unable to engage with the mitotic spindle and/or fail to segregate properly to the daughter nuclei during anaphase. The lagging fragments or whole chromosomes are surrounded by membrane and become MNi. Acentric fragments are caused by failure of repair or mis-repair of DNA strand breaks which may be induced by chemicals that (i) damage the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, and/or (ii) inhibit the DNA damage response mechanisms or repair of DNA strand breaks and/or (iii) cause DNA replication stress due to DNA adduct or cross-link formation. MNi originating from lagging whole chromosomes may be induced by chemicals that cause defects in centromeres or the mitotic machinery. Mis-repair of chemically-induced DNA breaks may also cause formation of dicentric chromosomes and nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) between daughter nuclei in mitosis. NPBs may break and initiate recurring breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and chromosomal instability. The review also explores knowledge on (i) the routes by which lymphocytes in the human body may be exposed to genotoxic chemicals, (ii) kinetics of MNi expression in lymphocytes in vivo and ex vivo in the lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (L-CBMN) assay and (iii) current evidence on the efficiency of the L-CBMN assay in detecting in vivo exposure to chemical genotoxins and its concordance with MNi expression in epithelial tissues. The review also identifies important knowledge gaps (e.g. effect of nanomaterials; interactions with nutritional deficiencies etc.) regarding mechanisms by which in vivo chemical genotoxin exposure may cause MNi formation in lymphocytes in vivo and ex vivo in lymphocytes.",

     "abstract": "The lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been applied in hundreds of in vivo biomonitoring studies of humans exposed either environmentally or occupationally to genotoxic chemicals. However, there is an emerging need to re-evaluate the use of MN and other biomarkers within the lymphocyte CBMN cytome assay as quantitative indicators of exposure to main classes of chemical genotoxins.The main aim of the present report is to systematically review published studies investigating the use of the lymphocyte CBMN assay to determine DNA damage in subjects exposed to anaesthetic gases. We also compared performance of the CBMN assay with other DNA damage assays employed and identified strengths and weaknesses of the published studies. We have retrieved 11 studies, published between 1996 and 2013, reporting MN associated with occupational exposures (operating room personnel). The individual job categories were often described (anaesthesiologists, technicians, radiologists) among cases, as well as duration of exposure. All studies reported the compounds present at the workplace and, in some instances, the exposure levels were measured. Controls were usually recruited among personnel at the hospital not exposed to anaesthetics or they were healthy unexposed subjects from general population. The number of investigated subjects, due to the character of the occupation, was relatively smaller than those investigated in other occupational monitoring settings. Overall, the majority of the studies were age- and gender- matched (or investigated only males or females) while less attention was given to lifestyle confounders. Appropriate measurement of exposure, available in approximately half of the studies only, was compromised by the lack of the personal dosimetry-based determinations.In all studies, higher MN frequencies were observed in exposed individuals. The meta-analysis of mean MN frequency of combined studies confirmed this tendency (log mean ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.56 [0.34-0.77]; P\u00a0=\u00a03.51\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22127).

     "abstract": "Many studies have reported the occurrence of work-environment contamination by antineoplastic drugs (ANPD), with significant incorporation of trace amounts of these hazardous drugs in hospital personnel. Given the ability of most ANPD to actively bind DNA, thus inducing genotoxic effects, it is of pivotal importance to assess the degree of genotoxic damage (i.e., residual genotoxic risk) in occupationally exposed subjects. The lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (L-CBMN) assay is largely used for biological effect monitoring in subjects occupationally exposed to ANPD. In this study, we identified and analyzed the studies published reporting the use of the L-CBMN assay as biomarker of genotoxic risk in health care workers exposed to ANPD with the aim of performing meta-analysis and providing a meta-estimate of the genotoxic effect of exposure. We retrieved 24 studies, published from 1988 to 2015, measuring MN in peripheral blood lymphocytes in health care workers occupationally exposed to ANPD. In 15 out of the 24 studies (62.5%), increased MN frequencies were recognized in exposed subjects as compared to controls. The meta-analysis of MN frequency of the combined studies confirmed an association between occupational exposure to ANPD and cytogenetic effects with an overall meta-estimate of 1.67 [95% CI: 1.41\u20131.98]. In 16 out of the 24 studies (66.6%) at least one other genotoxicity biomarker, besides L-CBMN assay, was employed for biological effect monitoring. In several studies the effect of exposure to ANPD was evaluated also in terms of MN in exfoliated buccal cells. Other studies focused on genotoxicity endpoints, such as sister chromatid exchanges (3 studies), chromosome aberrations (6 studies), or primary DNA damage investigated by comet assay (7 studies). Overall, there was good agreement between other genotoxicity tests employed and L-CBMN assay outcomes.",

     "abstract": "Formaldehyde (FAL) is classified as a Class I carcinogen by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer. Therefore, there is a need to validate appropriate methods for detecting its genotoxic effects in vivo in humans. One of the most commonly used methods to measure the genotoxic effects of exposure to environmental chemicals is the lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (L-CBMN assay). We performed a systematic review and statistical analysis of the results from all of the published studies in which the L-CBMN assay was used to measure the genotoxic effects of human exposure to FAL. The results of this systematic review indicated that the majority (62%) of the 21 investigations in the 17 published studies we examined showed significant increases in lymphocyte micronucleus (MN) frequency (a biomarker of chromosome breakage or loss), in exposed subjects relative to controls. We used a novel quality score tool to determine if the investigations adequately addressed known variables that affect MN frequency in lymphocytes and found that MN frequency was not explained by quality because there was no significant correlation between quality score and fold-change in MN frequency (R\u00a0=\u00a00.008, P\u00a0=\u00a00.97). The results of all of the studies (positive or negative), when combined together, indicated a highly significant doubling in lymphocyte MN frequency in those exposed to FAL relative to controls (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). These observations, together with a significant positive correlation between L-CBMN assay MN frequency and FAL air concentration (R\u00a0=\u00a00.529, P\u00a0=\u00a00.017) indicate the suitability of this method to measure in vivo genotoxicity of FAL. Furthermore, fold-increase in lymphocyte MN frequency in the exposed subjects relative to controls was strongly positively correlated with the duration of FAL exposure (R\u00a0=\u00a00.779, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) suggesting the need to better understand the potential for cumulative genomic instability induced by chronic exposures to FAL.",

     "abstract": "The lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay is applied in many different in vivo biomonitoring studies of human exposure to genotoxic chemicals. Among extensively chemicals investigated, we identified petroleum and its derivatives, in particular benzene and the most common mixture of benzene, toluene, and xylene. Although conflicting results have been reported on the effects of benzene exposure, the number of positive findings in independent studies suggests that occupational exposure to benzene causes DNA damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes. To assess current evidence on this hypothesis, we conducted a meta-analysis. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of benzene exposure on genetic damage, quantified using the CBMN assay on individuals occupationally exposed to petroleum and its derivatives. Statistical analyses were conducted using the rmeta package from the free Software Environment for Statistical Computing R. Combined study results indicated that benzene exposure is associated with an increased level of genetic damage in peripheral blood lymphocytes, as reflected by an increased MN frequency. The summary mean difference in MN frequency between exposed and unexposed individuals was 1.64 (95% CI: 0.80\u20132.47). Overall, this finding points to MN frequency as a sensitive biomarker which could be used to evaluate genetic damage induced by occupational \u2013 industrial or environmental \u2013 exposure to benzene. This review also identified some important knowledge gaps as well as the need of large, well-designed studies. In particular, it is fundamental to accurately characterize the investigated population, including dietary habits and genetic variability which could modulate MN frequency in both exposed individuals and unexposed controls. In conclusion, according to present findings the use of the CBMN assay in biomonitoring studies could provide objective evidence to guide prioritization of preventive interventions in subjects occupationally exposed to petroleum derivatives, and in particular benzene.",

     "abstract": "1,3-Butadiene (BD), an important industrial chemical used in the production of synthetic rubber and resins and a ubiquitous environmental pollutant, was classified as a human carcinogen by IARC. BD requires metabolic activation to different epoxides that are known to bind to DNA, inducing also DNA-DNA and DNA-protein crosslinks. The DNA damage leading to mutations has been identified as the mode of action of BD. Experimental studies in rodents revealed widely different BD carcinogenic/mutagenic potency in rat and mice, associated to differences in BD metabolism. The available biomonitoring studies in workers occupationally exposed to BD, considering different genetic endpoints, do not allow to reach a conclusion on the BD carcinogenic/mutagenic risk in humans. The present systematic review retrieves and analyzes the published studies on the application of the cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in peripheral lymphocytes (L-CBMN) of BD exposed subjects. Ten articles were retrieved related to seven studies on BD exposure and one study on exposure to a mixture of compounds in a styrene-butadiene tire manufacturing plant. Four studies carried out in Europe related to heterogeneous groups of workers exposed in BD monomer or polymer manufacturing and processing industries, reporting mean individual exposure levels below 3\u00a0ppm, failed to find any increase of MN frequency. Three studies, including mixed groups of workers involved in different stages of the production and manufacturing of BD in China, show increased MN frequencies associated with the intensity of the exposure, with a relevant positive response (FR\u00a0=\u00a02.29) when the mean cumulative dose was estimated as 266\u00a0ppm/year. These results are consistent with the data on the exposure-response curve for total leukemia mortality showing no increase for cumulative exposure less than or equal to 200 BD ppm-years. The L-CBMN assay, measuring both chromosome breakage and chromosome loss, events involved in induction of leukemia, seems to be a promising biomarker for cancer risk induced by BD.",

While several epidemiological studies have reported carcinogenicity and EtO-Hb formation; information from cytogenetic endpoints are rather inconclusive. In the present review, we focus on the results of eleven studies which have reported the results of micronucleus assay in EtO exposed workers. We have critically reviewed these studies based on the exposure assessment, concentration and duration, and compared the sensitivity of micronucleus assay to other reported endpoints like EtO-Hb, CA, SCE. The levels of EtO and EtO-Hb adducts in all the studies were strongly correlated to the results of SCE, but not to MN. MN were only observed in a limited number of studies with high EtO exposure (2\u201328\u00a0ppm 8\u00a0h-TWA) and not below the recommended concentration of <1\u00a0ppm. To further understand the effect of exposure of EtO on MN assay outcome, we propose studies with more harmonized protocol for exposure assessment and MN analysis, determination of suitable sample size and use of multiple target tissues to understand the effect of metabolite.",

     "abstract": "Styrene is a building-block of several compounds used in a wide array of materials and products. The most important human exposure to this substance occurs in industrial settings, especially among reinforced-plastics industry workers. The effect of occupational exposure to styrene on cytogenetics biomarkers has been previously reviewed with positive association observed for chromosomal aberrations, and inconclusive data for the micronucleus assay. Some limitations were noted in those studies, including inadequate exposure assessment and poor epidemiological design. Furthermore, in earlier studies micronuclei frequency was measured with protocols not as reliable as cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay. Aim of the present systematic review and meta-analysis is to investigate genomic instability and DNA damage as measured by the CBMN assay in lymphocytes of subjects exposed to styrene. A total of 11 studies published between 2004 and 2012 were included in the meta-analysis encompassing 479 styrene-exposed workers and 510 controls. The quality of each study was estimated by a quality scoring system which ranked studies according to the consideration of major confounders, exposure characterization, and technical parameters. An overall increase of micronuclei frequencies was found in styrene-exposure workers when compared to referents (meta-MR 1.34; 95% CI 1.18\u20131.52), with significant increases achieved in six individual studies. The consistency of results in individual studies, the independence of this result from major confounding factors and from the quality of the study strengthens the reliability of risk estimates and supports the use of the CBMN assay in monitoring genetic risk in styrene workers.",

Their toxicity is usually subsequent to inhalation and can lead to pulmonary dysfunctions and diseases, including cancer. Cytochalasin B blocked micronucleus assay in lymphocytes (L-CBMN) has been shown as a sensitive and reliable technique in assessing genotoxic exposure, An extensive search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases allowed retrieval of 18 articles on occupational or environmental exposure evaluating L-CBMN in subjects exposed to fibers or dusts (asbestos, silica, rockwool, beryllium, tobacco, and wood). For each study, mean L-CBMN levels were compared in exposed subjects vs. unexposed controls providing a point estimate, the Mean Ratio (MR). The high heterogeneity among retrieved studies and their relatively limited number did not allow a quantitative meta-analysis. However, the inter-quartile range of all MRs fell within the interval between 1.25 and 2.23, supporting the hypothesis that exposure to airborne particles increases DNA damage, although mechanisms of genotoxicity should be further investigated. A borderline significant correlation was found with SCE, but not with chromosome aberrations or comet assay. Future research should focus on exposure assessment, in order to perform proper dose-response studies and disentangle the effect of different compounds in mixed exposures. To fully exploit the cytome assay, L-CBMN frequency should be integrated with other endpoints, such as nucleoplasmic bridges and nuclear buds. The use of alternative tissues, such as nasal and buccal mucosa, and the implementation of other cytogenetic assay, may help to understand the effects of this exposure.",

     "abstract": "Millions of humans are exposed occupationally and environmentally to lead, mercury and cadmium compounds. Mercury compounds are less abundant but some of them belong to the most toxic chemicals which are known. We evaluated the literature to find out if these metals act in humans as genotoxic carcinogens and if their health effects can be predicted by use of micronucleus (MN) assays with lymphocytes and/or with other genotoxicity tests. Numerous studies showed that lead and mercury induce cancer in humans and also in animals, in vitro experiments with cultured cells indicate that they cause DNA damage via different molecular mechanisms including release of reactive oxygen species and interactions with DNA repair processes. Also in most human studies, positive results were obtained in MN tests with lymphocytes (all 15 occupational studies with lead yielded positive results, with mercury 6 out of 7 investigations were positive). For cadmium, there is clear evidence that it causes cancer in humans; however, induction of chromosomal damage was only seen in high dose experiments with mammalian cells while results of animal and human studies yielded conflicting results (only in 2 of 5\u00a0MN trials with humans positive findings were reported). Possibly, non-genotoxic mechanisms such as inhibition of apoptosis and interaction with signaling pathways account for the carcinogenic properties of cadmium species. The findings of MN studies with lead and mercury are in excellent agreement with results which were obtained with other endpoints (e.g. chromosomal aberrations and comet formations) and it is evident that this approach can be used for occupational and environmental monitoring of exposed individuals. Important future tasks will be the realization of larger studies with a uniform standardized protocol, the additional evaluation of anomalies other than MN (nuclear buds and bridges) and the combination of such trials with investigations which allow to define the molecular mechanisms relevant for exposed humans.",

     "abstract": "Various metals have demonstrated genotoxic and carcinogenic potential via different mechanisms. Until now, biomonitoring and epidemiological studies have been carried out to assess the genotoxic risk to exposed human populations. In this sense, the use of the micronucleus assay in peripheral blood lymphocytes has proven to be a useful tool to determine increased levels of DNA damage, as a surrogate biomarker of cancer risk. Here we review those biomonitoring studies focused on people exposed to arsenic, chromium, nickel, vanadium and complex mixtures of metals. Only those studies that used the frequency of micronuclei in binucleated (BNMN) cells have been taken into consideration, although the inclusion of other biomarkers of exposure and genotoxicity are also reflected and discussed. Regarding arsenic, most of the occupational and environmental biomonitoring studies find an increase in BNMN among the exposed individuals. Thus, it seems conclusive that arsenic exposure increases the risk of exposed human populations. However, a lack of correlation between the level of exposure and the increase in BNMN is also common, and a limited number of studies evaluated the genotype as a risk modulator. As for chromium, a BNMN increase in occupationally exposed subjects and a correlation between level of exposure and effect is found consistently in the available literature. However, the quality score of the studies is only medium-low. On the other hand, the studies evaluating nickel and vanadium are scarce and lacks a correct characterization of the individual exposure, which difficult the building of clear conclusions. Finally, several studies with medium-high quality scores evaluated a more realistic scenario of exposure which takes into account a mixture of metals. Among them, those which correctly characterized and measured the exposure were able to find association with the level of BNMN. Also, several genes associated with DNA damage repair such as OGG1 and XRCC1 were found to influence the exposure effect.",

Biomonitoring of human populations can provide an early detection system for the initiation of cell dysregulation in the development of cancer, which would help develop an efficient prevention program. Recently, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay in lymphocyte cells has become an important tool for assessing DNA damage in exposed populations. This is the method of choice for population-based studies of occupational and/or environmental exposure to different agents. In this review, human populations exposed to coal, dyes, paints, organic solvents in a complex mixture, and others miscellaneous chemicals were analyzed. Data from 28 studies was evaluated in relation to the effect of complex mixture exposition on micronucleus (MN) frequency. Other biomarkers and the background factors were evaluated as well, such as gender, age, or smoking habit. Most of these studies (75%) showed a significant increase of micronucleated cells to exposed groups in relation to the control groups, besides chromosomal aberrations (CA), sister chromatid exchanging (SCE) and comet cells (comet assay). The studies from this review about miscellaneous chemicals exposures using CBMN assay have indicated some time and dose-dependent effects. Overall, the findings suggest that the responses resulting from exposure to complex mixtures are varied and complicated. However, they are also an important mechanism of DNA damage concerning disruption of metal ion homeostasis that may lead to oxidative stress, a state where increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) overwhelms body antioxidant protection and subsequently could induce cancer.",

     "abstract": "Pesticides are widely used around the world, and hundreds of millions of people are exposed annually in occupational and environmental settings. Numerous studies have demonstrated relationships between pesticide exposure and increased risk of cancers, neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders, respiratory diseases and diabetes. Assessment of genotoxicity of pesticides and biomonitoring their effect in exposed populations is critical for a better regulation and protection, but it can be complicated because pesticides are often used as complex mixtures. The cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay in human lymphocytes (L-CBMN) is a validated method of assessment of DNA damage induced by clastogenic and aneuploidogenic mechanisms. The goal of this review is to provide an updated summary of publications on biomonitoring studies using this assay in people exposed to pesticides in different settings, and to identify gaps in knowledge, and future directions. A literature search was conducted through MedLine/PubMed and TOXLINE electronic databases up to December 2015. A total of 55 full-text articles, related to 49 studies, excluding reviews, were selected for in depth analysis, divided by the settings where exposures occurred, such as chemical plant workers, pesticide sprayers, floriculturists, agricultural workers and non-occupationally exposed groups. Majority of studies (36 out of 49) reported positive findings with L-CBMN assay. However, most of the studies of professional applicators that used single pesticide or few compounds in the framework of specific programs did not show significant increases in MN frequency. A decreased level of pesticide-induced genotoxicity was associated with the proper use of personal protection. In contrast, subjects working in greenhouses or during intensive spraying season and having acute exposure, showed consistent increases in MN frequency. Overall, this analysis confirmed that L-CBMN is an excellent tool for pesticide biomonitoring, and can validate the effects of educational and intervention programs on reducing exposure and genetic damage.",

In this review, most commonly used biomarkers of early genetic effects were analyzed for their adequacy after NM exposures. A more in depth analysis of the ex vivo/in vitro lymphocyte MN assay was performed, although, in literature no studies are available using this assay for NM exposures. Therefore, the known factors determining the NMs tissue/cellular targets and the multiplicity of modes of action of NMs were summarized. The main pending questions are whether (1) lymphocytes are a NM target or an adequate surrogate tissue, (2) whether the buccal MN assay might be more suitable for NM exposures via inhalation or ingestion, as buccal cells might be exposed more directly. While the current state-of-the-art does not allow for drawing firm conclusions, major research gaps are identified and some cautious recommendations can be formulated. Therefore in vitro and in vivo studies should be conducted comparing methodologies side-by-side in the same subjects and for different types of NMs. The ex vivo/in vitro MN assay in its automated version, allowing objective analysis of large cohorts and detection of direct and indirect genotoxic effects, remains a valuable candidate for human biomonitoring to NM exposure. Considering the potential cancer risk from exposure to NMs and previous dramatic experiences with too late surveillance of occupational exposures to similar substances (e.g. to asbestos), there is an urgent need to define and implement adequate scientifically sound biomonitoring methods and programme for exposure to NMs.",

     "abstract": "Mutations in the translocated BCL2 gene are often detected in diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), indicating both their significance and pervasiveness. Large series genome sequencing of more than 200 DLBCLs has identified frequent BCL2 mutations clustered in the exons coding for the BH4 domain and the folded loop domain (FLD) of the protein. However, BCL2 mutations are mostly contemplated to represent bystander events with negligible functional impact on the pathogenesis of DLBCL. BCL2 arbitrates apoptosis through a classic interaction between its hydrophobic groove forming BH1-3 domains and the BH3 domain of pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family. The effects of mutations are mainly determined by the ability of the mutated BCL2 to mediate apoptosis by this inter-member protein binding. Nevertheless, BCL2 regulates diverse non-canonical pathways that are unlikely to be explained by canonical interactions. In this review, first, we identify recurrent missense mutations in the BH4 domain and the FLD reported in independent lymphoma sequencing studies. Second, we discuss the probable consequences of mutations on the binding ability of BCL2 to non-BCL2 family member proteins crucial for 1) maintaining mitochondrial energetics and calcium hemostasis such as VDAC, IP3R, and RyR and 2) oncogenic pathways implicated in the acquisition of the \u2018hallmarks of cancer\u2019 such as SOD, Raf-1, NFAT, p53, HIF-1\u03b1, and gelsolin. The study also highlights the likely ramifications of mutations on binding of BCL2 antagonists and BH3 profiling. Based on our analysis, we believe that an in-depth focus on BCL2 interactions mediated by these domains is warranted to elucidate the functional significance of missense mutations in DLBCL. In summary, we provide an extensive overview of the pleiotropic functions of BCL2 mediated by its physical binding interaction with other proteins and the various ways BCL2 mutations would affect the normal function of the cell leading to the development of DLBCL.",

     "abstract": "Fanconi anaemia (FA) is a hereditary disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, developmental defects, predisposition to cancer and chromosomal abnormalities. FA is caused by biallelic mutations that inactivate genes encoding proteins involved in replication stress-associated DNA damage responses. The 20 FANC proteins identified to date constitute the FANC pathway. A key event in this pathway involves the monoubiquitination of the FANCD2-FANCI heterodimer by the collective action of at least 10 different proteins assembled in the FANC core complex. The FANC core complex-mediated monoubiquitination of FANCD2-FANCI is essential to assemble the heterodimer in subnuclear, chromatin-associated, foci and to regulate the process of DNA repair as well as the rescue of stalled replication forks. Several recent works have demonstrated that the activity of the FANC pathway is linked to several other protein post-translational modifications from the ubiquitin-like family, including SUMO and NEDD8. These modifications are related to DNA damage responses but may also affect other cellular functions potentially related to the clinical phenotypes of the syndrome. This review summarizes the interplay between the ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins and the FANC proteins that constitute a major pathway for the surveillance of the genomic integrity and addresses the implications of their interactions in maintaining genome stability.",

     "abstract": "The plethora of knowledge gained on myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), a heterogeneous pre-malignant disorder of hematopoietic stem cells, through sequencing of several pathway genes has unveiled molecular pathogenesis and its progression to AML. Evolution of phenotypic classification and risk-stratification based on peripheral cytopenias and blast count has moved to five-tier risk-groups solely concerning chromosomal aberrations. Increased frequency of complex abnormalities, which is associated with genetic instability, defines the subgroup of worst prognosis in MDS. However, the independent effect of monosomal karyotype remains controversial. Recent discoveries on mutations in RNA-splicing machinery (SF3B1, SRSF2, ZRSR2, U2AF1, U2AF2); DNA methylation (TET2, DNMT3A, IDH1/2); chromatin modification (ASXL1, EZH2); transcription factor (TP53, RUNX1); signal transduction/kinases (FLT3, JAK2); RAS pathway (KRAS, NRAS, CBL, NF1, PTPN11); cohesin complex (STAG2, CTCF, SMC1A, RAD21); DNA repair (ATM, BRCC3, DLRE1C, FANCL); and other pathway genes have given insights into the independent effects and interaction of co-occurrence of mutations on disease-phenotype. RNA-splicing and DNA methylation mutations appeared to occur early and are reported as \u2018founder\u2019 mutations in over 50% MDS patients. TET2 mutation, through altered DNA methylation, has been found to have independent prognostic response to hypomethylating agents. Moreover, presence of DNMT3A, TET2 and ASXL1 mutations in normal elderly individuals forms the basis of understanding that accumulation of somatic mutations may not cause direct disease-development; however, cooperation with other mutations in the genes that are frequently mutated in myeloid and other hematopoietic cancers might result in clonal expansion through self-renewal and/or proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells. Identification of small molecules as inhibitors of epigenetic mutations has opened avenues for tailoring targeted drug development. The recommendations of a Clinical Advisory Committee is being considered by WHO for a revised classification of risk-groups of MDS, which is likely to be published in mid 2016, based on the new developments and discoveries of gene mutations.",

Although the epigenome and genome may be equally important in carcinogenicity, the genotoxicity of chemical agents and exposure-related transcriptomic responses have been more thoroughly studied and characterized. To better understand the evidence for epigenetic alterations of human carcinogens, and the potential association with genotoxic endpoints, we conducted a systematic review of published studies of genotoxic carcinogens that reported epigenetic endpoints. Specifically, we searched for publications reporting epigenetic effects for the 28 agents and occupations included in Monograph Volume 100F of the International Agency for the Research on Cancer (IARC) that were classified as \u201ccarcinogenic to humans\u201d (Group 1) with strong evidence of genotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenesis. We identified a total of 158 studies that evaluated epigenetic alterations for 12 of these 28 carcinogenic agents and occupations (1,3-butadiene, 4-aminobiphenyl, aflatoxins, benzene, benzidine, benzo[a]pyrene, coke production, formaldehyde, occupational exposure as a painter, sulfur mustard, and vinyl chloride). Aberrant DNA methylation was most commonly studied, followed by altered expression of non-coding RNAs and histone changes (totaling 85, 59 and 25 studies, respectively). For 3 carcinogens (aflatoxins, benzene and benzo[a]pyrene), 10 or more studies reported epigenetic effects. However, epigenetic studies were sparse for the remaining 9 carcinogens; for 4 agents, only 1 or 2 published reports were identified. While further research is needed to better identify carcinogenesis-associated epigenetic perturbations for many potential carcinogens, published reports on specific epigenetic endpoints can be systematically identified and increasingly incorporated in cancer hazard assessments.",

Methylation of H3K79 is involved in the regulation of telomeric silencing, cellular development, cell-cycle checkpoint, DNA repair, and regulation of transcription. hDot1L-mediated H3K79 methylation appears to have a crucial role in transformation as well as disease progression in leukemias involving several oncogenic fusion proteins.

     "abstract": "Environmental mutagens cause DNA damage that disturbs replication and produces mutations, leading to cancer and other diseases. We discuss mechanisms of mutagenesis resulting from DNA damage, from the level of DNA replication by a single polymerase to the complex DNA replisome of some typical model organisms (including bacteriophage T7, T4, Sulfolobus solfataricus, Escherichia coli, yeast and human). For a single DNA polymerase, DNA damage can affect replication in three major ways: reducing replication fidelity, causing frameshift mutations, and blocking replication. For the DNA replisome, protein interactions and the functions of accessory proteins can yield rather different results even with a single DNA polymerase. The mechanism of mutation during replication performed by the DNA replisome is a long-standing question. Using new methods and techniques, the replisomes of certain organisms and human cell extracts can now be investigated with regard to the bypass of DNA damage. In this review, we consider the molecular mechanism of mutagenesis resulting from DNA damage in replication at the levels of single DNA polymerases and complex DNA replisomes, including translesion DNA synthesis.",

     "abstract": "In cancer treatment, chemotherapy is one of the main strategies used. The knowledge of the cellular and molecular characteristics of tumors allows the use of more specific drugs, making the removal of tumors more efficient. Among the drugs of choice in these treatments, topoisomerase inhibitors are widely used against different types of tumors. Topoisomerases are enzymes responsible for maintaining the structure of DNA, altering its topological state temporarily during the processes of replication and transcription, in order to avoid supercoiling and entanglements at the double helix. The DNA damage formed as a result of topoisomerase inhibition can be repaired by DNA repair mechanisms. Thus, DNA repair pathways can modulate the effectiveness of chemotherapy. Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) are the main pathways involved in the removal of double strand breaks (DSBs); while nucleotide excision repair (NER) is mainly characterized by the removal of lesions that lead to significant structural distortions in the DNA double helix. Evidence has shown that DSBs are the main type of damage resulting from the inhibition of the DNA topoisomerase II enzyme, and therefore the involvement of HR and NHEJ pathways in the repair process is well established. However, some topoisomerase II inhibitors induce other types of lesions, like DNA adducts, interstrand crosslinks and reactive oxygen species, and studies have shown that other DNA repair pathways might be participating in removing injury induced by these drugs. This review aims to correlate the involvement of proteins from different DNA repair pathways in response to these drugs, with an emphasis on NER.",

We undertook a systematic review of the literature followed by meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses in order to compare the frequency of b2/b3 deletions between oligo/azoospermic infertile and normozoospermicmen. Out of twenty-four studies reviewed for meta-analysis, twenty reported no correlation between this deletion and male infertility and two studies each reported a direct and inverse correlation. In the collective analysis, 241 out of 8892 (2.71%) oligo/azoospermic individuals and 118 out of 5842 (2.02%) normozoospermic controls had a b2/b3 deletion, suggesting a relatively higher frequency of deletions in the cases. Eventually, meta-analysis showed a significant correlation between b2/b3 deletions and the risk of spermatogenic loss/infertility (Fixed model: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.313, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20131.65, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02; Random model: OR\u00a0=\u00a01.315, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u20131.70, p\u00a0=\u00a00.037). Further meta-analysis on studies grouped by ethnicity and geographic regions showed that the b2/b3 deletions are significantly associated with spermatogenic loss/infertility in Mongolians, Nigro-Caucasians, East Asians and Africans, but not in Caucasians, Europeans, South Asians and Dravidians. In summary, the Y-chromosome b2/b3 deletions increase infertility risk; however, it may be significant only in the Mongolian populations and the East Asian region.",

     "abstract": "In this review, the protective function of the abundant non-coding DNA in the eukaryotic genome is discussed from the perspective of genome defense against exogenous nucleic acids. Peripheral non-coding DNA has been proposed to act as a bodyguard that protects the genome and the central protein-coding sequences from ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage. In the proposed mechanism of protection, the radicals generated by water radiolysis in the cytosol and IR energy are absorbed, blocked and/or reduced by peripheral heterochromatin; then, the DNA damage sites in the heterochromatin are removed and expelled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm through nuclear pore complexes, most likely through the formation of extrachromosomal circular DNA. To strengthen this hypothesis, this review summarizes the experimental evidence supporting the protective function of non-coding DNA against exogenous nucleic acids. Based on these data, I hypothesize herein about the presence of an additional line of defense formed by small RNAs in the cytosol in addition to their bodyguard protection mechanism in the nucleus. Therefore, exogenous nucleic acids may be initially inactivated in the cytosol by small RNAs generated from non-coding DNA via mechanisms similar to the prokaryotic CRISPR-Cas system. Exogenous nucleic acids may enter the nucleus, where some are absorbed and/or blocked by heterochromatin and others integrate into chromosomes. The integrated fragments and the sites of DNA damage are removed by repetitive non-coding DNA elements in the heterochromatin and excluded from the nucleus. Therefore, the normal eukaryotic genome and the central protein-coding sequences are triply protected by non-coding DNA against invasion by exogenous nucleic acids. This review provides evidence supporting the protective role of non-coding DNA in genome defense.",

     "abstract": "The Comet assay has been recently adapted to investigate DNA damage in insects. The first reports of its use in Drosophila melanogaster appeared in 2002. Since then, the interest in the application of the Comet assay to studies of insects has been rapidly increasing. Many authors see substantial potential in the use of the Comet assay in D. melanogaster for medical toxicology studies. This application could allow the testing of drugs and result in an understanding of the mechanisms of action of toxins, which could significantly influence the limited research that has been performed on vertebrates. The possible perspectives and benefits for science are considered in this review.In the last decade, the use of the Comet assay has been described in insects other than D. melanogaster. Specifically, methods to prepare a cell suspension from insect tissues, which is a difficult task, were analyzed and compared in detail. Furthermore, attention was paid to any differences and modifications in the research protocols, such as the buffer composition and electrophoresis conditions.Various scientific fields in addition to toxicological and ecotoxicological research were considered. We expect the Comet assay to be used in environmental risk assessments and to improve our understanding of many important phenomena of insect life, such as metamorphosis, molting, diapause and quiescence. The use of this method to study species that are of key importance to humans, such as pests and beneficial insects, appears to be highly probable and very promising. The use of the Comet assay for DNA stability testing in insects will most likely rapidly increase in the future.",

Animal studies have shown that the spontaneous mutation rate is higher during pregnancy and infancy than in adulthood. Human and animal studies have found higher levels of DNA damage and mutations induced by mutagens in fetuses/newborns than in adults. This greater susceptibility could be due to reduced DNA repair capacity. In fact, several studies indicated that some DNA repair pathways seem to be deficient during ontogenesis. This has been demonstrated also in murine hematopoietic stem cells.Genotoxicity in the hematopoietic system has been widely studied for several reasons: it is easy to assess, deals with populations cycling also in the adults and may be relevant for leukemogenesis.Reviewing the literature concerning the application of the micronucleus test (a validated assay to assess genotoxicity) in fetus/newborns and adults, we found that the former show almost always higher values than the latter, both in animals treated with genotoxic substances and in those untreated. Therefore, we draw the conclusion that the genotoxic sensitivity of the hematopoietic system is more pronounced during fetal life and decreases during ontogenic development.",

     "publication date": "03-2016",
     "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, is an obligatory intracellular parasite with a digenetic life cycle. Due to the variety of host environments, it faces several sources of oxidative stress. In addition to reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by its own metabolism, T. cruzi must deal with high ROS levels generated as part of the host's immune responses. Hence, the conclusion that T. cruzi has limited ability to deal with ROS (based on the lack of a few enzymes involved with oxidative stress responses) seems somewhat paradoxical. Actually, to withstand such variable sources of oxidative stress, T. cruzi has developed complex defence mechanisms. This includes ROS detoxification pathways that are distinct from the ones in the mammalian host, DNA repair pathways and specialized polymerases, which not only protect its genome from the resulting oxidative damage but also contribute to the generation of genetic diversity within the parasite population. Recent studies on T. cruzi\u2019s DNA repair pathways as mismatch repair (MMR) and GO system suggested that, besides a role associated with DNA repair, some proteins of these pathways may also be involved in signalling oxidative damage. Recent data also suggested that an oxidative environment might be beneficial for parasite survival within the host cell as it contributes to iron mobilization from the host's intracellular storages. Besides contributing to the understanding of basic aspects of T. cruzi biology, these studies are highly relevant since oxidative stress pathways are part of the poorly understood mechanisms behind the mode of action of drugs currently used against this parasite. By unveiling new peculiar aspects of T. cruzi biology, emerging data on DNA repair pathways and other antioxidant defences from this parasite have revealed potential new targets for a much needed boost in drug development efforts towards a better treatment for Chagas disease.",

For epilepsy, autism spectrum disorders, and neuromotor disorders, including cerebral palsy, initial estimates put the frequency of causative de novo mutations at about 15% and about 10% of these are somatic. There are some shared mutated genes between these three classes of disease. Studies of copy number variation by comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) proceded the NGS approaches but they also detect de novo variation which is especially important for ASDs.

     "abstract": "The aim of this review is to describe the reactions which lead to generation of 5-hydroxymethyluracil, as well as the repair processes involved in its removal from DNA, and its level in various cells and urine. 5-hydroxymethyluracil may be formed during the course of the two processes: oxidation/hydroxylation of thymine with resultant formation of 5-hydroxymethyluracil paired with adenine (produced by reactive oxygen species), and reacting of reactive oxygen species with 5-methylcytosine forming 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, followed by its deamination to 5-hydroxymethyluracil mispaired with guanine. However, other, perhaps enzymatic, mechanism(s) may be involved in formation of 5-hydroxymethyluracil mispaired with guanine. Indeed, this mispair may be also formed as a result of deamination of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, recently described \u201csixth\u201d DNA base. It was demonstrated that 5-hydroxymethyluracil paired with adenine can be also generated by TET enzymes from thymine during mouse embryonic cell differentiation. Therefore, it is possible that 5-hydroxymethyluracil is epigenetic mark. The level of 5-hydroxymethyluracil in various somatic tissues is relatively stable and resembles that observed in lymphocytes, about 0.5/106 dN in human colon, colorectal cancer as well as various rat and porcine tissues. Experimental evidence suggests that SMUG1 and TDG are main enzymes involved in removal of 5-hydroxymethyluracil from DNA. 5-hydroxymethyluracil, in form of 5-hydroxymethyluridine, was also detected in rRNA, and together with SMUG1 may play a role in rRNA quality control. To summarize, 5-hydroxymethyluracil is with no doubt a product of both enzymatic and reactive oxygen species-induced reaction. This modification may probably serve as an epigenetic mark, providing additional layer of information encoded within the genome. However, the pool of 5-hydroxymethyluracil generated as a result of oxidative stress is also likely to disturb physiological epigenetic processes, and as such may be defined as a lesion. Altogether this suggests that 5-hydroxymethyluracil may be either a regulatory or erroneous compound.",

     "abstract": "From a risk assessment perspective, DNA-reactive agents are conventionally assumed to have genotoxic risks at all exposure levels, thus applying a linear extrapolation for low-dose responses. New approaches discussed here, including more diverse and sensitive methods for assessing DNA damage and DNA repair, strongly support the existence of measurable regions where genotoxic responses with increasing doses are insignificant relative to control. Model monofunctional alkylating agents have in vitro and in vivo datasets amenable to determination of points of departure (PoDs) for genotoxic effects. A session at the 2013 Society of Toxicology meeting provided an opportunity to survey the progress in understanding the biological basis of empirically-observed PoDs for DNA alkylating agents. Together with the literature published since, this review discusses cellular pathways activated by endogenous and exogenous alkylation DNA damage. Cells have evolved conserved processes that monitor and counteract a spontaneous steady-state level of DNA damage. The ubiquitous network of DNA repair pathways serves as the first line of defense for clearing of the DNA damage and preventing mutation. Other biological pathways discussed here that are activated by genotoxic stress include post-translational activation of cell cycle networks and transcriptional networks for apoptosis/cell death. The interactions of various DNA repair and DNA damage response pathways provide biological bases for the observed PoD behaviors seen with genotoxic compounds. Thus, after formation of DNA adducts, the activation of cellular pathways can lead to the avoidance of a mutagenic outcome. The understanding of the cellular mechanisms acting within the low-dose region will serve to better characterize risks from exposures to DNA-reactive agents at environmentally-relevant concentrations.",

Several lines of evidence suggest a variety of mechanisms explaining the extreme radioresistance of microorganisms found usually in isolated environments on Earth. These findings are discussed thoroughly in this study. Although none of the strategies discussed here, appear to be universal against ionizing radiation, a general trend was found. There are two cellular mechanisms by which radioresistance is achieved: (a) protection of the proteome and DNA from damage induced by ionizing radiation and (b) recruitment of advanced and highly sophisticated DNA repair mechanisms, in order to reconstruct a fully functional genome. In this review, we critically discuss various protecting (antioxidant enzymes, presence or absence of certain elements, high metal ion or salt concentration etc.) and repair (Homologous Recombination, Single-Strand Annealing, Extended Synthesis-Dependent Strand Annealing) mechanisms that have been proposed to account for the extraordinary abilities of radioresistant organisms and the homologous radioresistance signature genes in these organisms.

     "abstract": "One of the earliest cellular responses to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) is the phosphorylation of the core histone protein H2AX (termed \u03b3H2AX). Persistent \u03b3H2AX is the level of \u03b3H2AX above baseline, measured at a given time-point beyond which DNA DSBs are normally expected to be repaired (usually persist for days to months). This review summarizes the concept of persistent \u03b3H2AX in the context of exogenous source induced DNA DSBs (e.g. ionizing radiation (IR), chemotherapeutic drugs, genotoxic agents), and endogenous \u03b3H2AX levels in normal aging and accelerated aging disorders. Summary of the current literature demonstrates the following (i) \u03b3H2AX persistence is a common phenomenon that occurs in humans and animals; (ii) nuclei retain persistent \u03b3H2AX foci for up to several months after IR exposure, allowing for retrospective biodosimetry; (iii) the combination of various radiosensitizing drugs with ionizing radiation exposure leads to persistent \u03b3H2AX response, thus enabling the potential for monitoring cancer patients\u2019 response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy as well as tailoring cancer treatments; (iv) persistent \u03b3H2AX accumulates in telomeric DNA and in cells undergoing cellular senescence; and (v) increased endogenous \u03b3H2AX levels may be associated with diseases of accelerated aging. In summary, measurement of persistent \u03b3H2AX could potentially be used as a marker of radiation biodosimetry, evaluating sensitivity to therapeutic genotoxins and radiotherapy, and exploring the association of unrepaired DNA DSBs on telomeres with diseases of accelerated aging.",

The potential use of the assay in clinics to monitor the development of local oral lesions and as an early biomarker for tumors and different chronic disorders was also investigated. A systematic review of the literature was carried out focusing on the clinical application of the assay. The literature search updated to January 2015 allowed to retrieve 42 eligible articles. Fifty three percent of investigations are related to oral, head and neck cancer, and premalignant oral diseases. Our analysis evidences a potential usefulness of the MN assay applied in buccal exfoliated cells in the prescreening and in the follow up of precancerous oral lesions. A significant excess of MN, in patients compared with matched controls was observed for subgroups of oral and neck cancer (meta-MR of 2.40, 95% CI: 2.02\u20132.85) and leukoplakia (meta-MR 1.88, 95% CI: 1.51\u20132.35). The meta-analysis of studies available on other tumors (meta-MR 2.00; 95% CI:1.66\u20132.41) indicates that the MN frequency in buccal cells could reflect the chromosomal instability of other organs. Increased MN frequency was also observed in small size studies on patients with chronic diseases, with Alzheimer\u2019s disease and with Down syndrome. The application of the cytome approach providing information of genotoxic, cytotoxic and cytostatic effects is suggestive of the possibility of an improvement in the predictive value of the assay and this deserves further investigations.",

It interacts physically with lamins, torsinA, emerin and protein phosphatase 1; potentially providing a pivotal mechanism for transducing signals across the inner nuclear membrane. In neurons a functional protein complex is formed, comprising LAP1 and torsinA and in skeletal muscle LAP1 and emerin likewise form a protein complex. Several isoforms of LAP1 have been reported across species. However, in humans only two isoforms have been described, LAP1B and LAP1C. The latter has only recently been reported, but its physiological function and mode of action are not clear. The first TOR1AIP1 (gene encoding LAP1) mutation identified is a single nucleotide deletion resulting in a frameshift and a putative truncated LAP1B protein (Turkish mutation). This has deleterious effects associated with a specific form of muscular dystrophy. A second point mutation, affecting both human LAP1 isoforms, was also recently described. This mutation involves the replacement of a single glutamic acid to alanine at position 482 (Moroccan Mutation), thereby causing severe dystonia, cerebellar atrophy and cardiomyopathy.This review focuses on the recently described human LAP1 isoform (LAP1C), the two recently reported LAP1 mutations and post-translational LAP1 modifications. The latter play an important role in regulating this protein. These scientific contributions strengthen the role of LAP1 in DYT1 dystonia and muscular dystrophy.",

However, in people reaching an age far beyond their statistical life expectancy the prevalence of diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or dementia, is much lower compared to \u201caveragely\u201d aged humans. These inverse observations in nonagenarians (90\u201399 years), centenarians (100\u2013109 years) and super-centenarians (110 years and older) require a closer look into dynamics underlying DNA damage within the oldest old of our society. Available data indicate improved DNA repair and antioxidant defense mechanisms in \u201csuper old\u201d humans, which are comparable with much younger cohorts. Partly as a result of these enhanced endogenous repair and protective mechanisms, the oldest old humans appear to cope better with risk factors for DNA damage over their lifetime compared to subjects whose lifespan coincides with the statistical life expectancy. This model is supported by study results demonstrating superior chromosomal stability, telomere dynamics and DNA integrity in \u201csuccessful agers\u201d. There is also compelling evidence suggesting that life-style related factors including regular physical activity, a well-balanced diet and minimized psycho-social stress can reduce DNA damage and improve chromosomal stability. The most conclusive picture that emerges from reviewing the literature is that reaching \u201csuper old\u201d age appears to be primarily determined by hereditary/genetic factors, while a healthy lifestyle additionally contributes to achieving the individual maximum lifespan in humans. More research is required in this rapidly growing population of super old people. In particular, there is need for more comprehensive investigations including short- and long-term lifestyle interventions as well as investigations focusing on the mechanisms causing DNA damage, mutations, and telomere shortening.",

In addition to the well-characterized role of ncRNAs in different physiological cellular processes, numerous studies have also indicated the crucial roles of ncRNAs in neurological diseases and cancer. Although involvement of short ncRNA in those pathologies has already been well documented, there is only scarce evidence to show the participation of lncRNAs. One of the examples of lncRNAs is BC200 RNA, which plays an important role in the regulation of dendritic protein expression. Mislocalization and overexpression of BC200 RNA leads to inadequate RNA delivery to the synapses and results in neurodegenerative processes of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and neoplastic changes in various groups of tissues.

They are multi-domain proteins, containing primarily calcium binding epidermal growth factor-like (cbEGF) domains and 8-cysteine/transforming growth factor-beta binding protein-like (TB) domains. Mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene give rise to Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder with clinical complications in the cardiovascular, skeletal, ocular and other organ systems. Here, we review the consequences of engineered Marfan syndrome mutations in fibrillin-1 at the protein, cellular and organismal levels.Representative point mutations associated with Marfan syndrome in affected individuals have been introduced and analyzed in recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments. Those mutations affect fibrillin-1 on a structural and functional level. Mutations which impair folding of cbEGF domains can affect protein trafficking. Protein folding disrupted by some mutations can lead to defective secretion in mutant fibrillin-1 fragments, whereas fragments with other Marfan mutations are secreted normally. Many Marfan mutations render fibrillin-1 more susceptible to proteolysis. There is also evidence that some mutations affect heparin binding. Few mutations have been further analyzed in mouse models. An extensively studied mouse model of Marfan syndrome expresses mouse fibrillin-1 with a missense mutation (p.C1039G). The mice display similar characteristics to human patients with Marfan syndrome. Overall, the analyses of engineered mutations leading to Marfan syndrome provide important insights into the pathogenic molecular mechanisms exerted by mutated fibrillin-1.",

     "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) comprise a group of repetitive sequences that bring positive, negative, as well as neutral effects to the host organism. Earlier considered as \u201cjunk DNA,\u201d TEs are now well-accepted driving forces of evolution and critical regulators of the expression of genetic information. Their activity is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms, including methylation of DNA and histone modifications. The loss of epigenetic control over TEs, exhibited as loss of DNA methylation and decondensation of the chromatin structure, may result in TEs reactivation, initiation of their insertional mutagenesis (retrotransposition) and has been reported in numerous human diseases, including cancer. Accumulating evidence suggests that these alterations are not the simple consequences of the disease, but often may drive the pathogenesis, as they can be detected early during disease development. Knowledge derived from the in vitro, in vivo, and epidemiological studies, clearly demonstrates that exposure to ubiquitous environmental stressors, many of which are carcinogens or suspected carcinogens, are capable of causing alterations in methylation and expression of TEs and initiate retrotransposition events. Evidence summarized in this review suggests that TEs are the sensitive endpoints for detection of effects caused by such environmental stressors, as ionizing radiation (terrestrial, space, and UV-radiation), air pollution (including particulate matter [PM]-derived and gaseous), persistent organic pollutants, and metals. Furthermore, the significance of these effects is characterized by their early appearance, persistence and presence in both, target organs and peripheral blood. Altogether, these findings suggest that TEs may potentially be introduced into safety and risk assessment and serve as biomarkers of exposure to environmental stressors. Furthermore, TEs also show significant potential to become invaluable surrogate biomarkers in clinic and possible targets for therapeutic modalities for disease treatment and prevention.",

     "abstract": "The basis for modern genetics was laid by Gregor Mendel. He proposed that traits belonging to the intraspecific variability class be studied. However, individuals of one species possess traits of another class. They are related to intraspecific similarity. Individuals never differ from each other in these traits. By analogy with traits varying within a species and determined by genes, it is conjectured that intraspecific similarity is determined by genes, too. If so, mutations in these genes can be obtained. This paper provides a review of works published in 2000\u20132014 that: (1) propose breeding methods for detection of mutations in Drosophila melanogaster genes that lead intraspecific similarity; these mutations were called conditional; (2) describe collections of conditional mutations in chromosomes X, 2, and 3 of Drosophila; (3) show unusual features of epigenetic nature in the mutants; and (4) analyze these features of the mutants. Based on the peculiarities of manifestation it is supposed that the recognized conditional mutations occur in genes responsible for intraspecific similarity. The genes presumably belong to the so-called regulatory network of the Drosophila genome. This approach expands the scope of breeding analysis introduced by G. Mendel for heredity studies 150 years ago.",

To attain the biological relevance of such non-linear responses, there is a need to identify the underlying defense mechanisms that allow tolerance to low doses of genotoxicants. This communication discusses presumptive cancer prevention mechanisms that may contribute to thresholds, i.e. points of departure, for each endpoint, from initial DNA lesion to tumor formation. We discuss a sequential order of genome protection during carcinogenesis where genotoxicant scavenging, cellular efflux, DNA repair, elimination of damaged cells by apoptosis, autophagy, silencing by DNA damage-triggered replicative senescence, and finally, elimination of transformed (premalignant) cells by the immune system are thought to be responsible for a threshold in tumor formation. We highlight DNA repair, for which experimental evidence has been recently provided to dictate a role in PoDs. In conclusion, from a theoretical perspective it is reasonable to posit that tolerance to low dose levels exists for each requisite step of tumor formation and these tolerance mechanisms are critical in determining thresholds in chemical carcinogenesis.",

This paper provides a background to the concepts, findings and methods of risk estimation that guided the field through the period of its growth to the beginning of the 21st century. It draws attention to several key facts: (a) thus far, genetic risk estimates have been made indirectly using mutation data collected in mouse radiation studies; (b) important uncertainties and unsolved problems remain, one notable example being that we still do not know the sensitivity of human female germ cells to radiation-induced mutations; and (c) the concept that dominated the field thus far, namely, that radiation exposures to germ cells can result in single gene diseases in the descendants of those exposed has been replaced by the concept that radiation exposure can cause DNA deletions, often involving more than one gene. Genetic risk estimation now encompasses work devoted to studies on DNA deletions induced in human germ cells, their expected frequencies, and phenotypes and associated clinical consequences in the progeny. We argue that the time is ripe to embark on a human genome-based, mechanism-driven, computational modeling of genetic risks of ionizing radiation, and we present a provisional framework for catalyzing research in the field in the 21st century.",

     "abstract": "Several mutations in nuclear genes encoding for mitochondrial components have been associated with an increased cancer risk or are even causative, e.g. succinate dehydrogenase (SDHB, SDHC and SDHD genes) and iso-citrate dehydrogenase (IDH1 and IDH2 genes). Recently, studies have suggested an eminent role for mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations in the development of a wide variety of cancers. Various studies associated mtDNA abnormalities, including mutations, deletions, inversions and copy number alterations, with mitochondrial dysfunction. This might, explain the hampered cellular bioenergetics in many cancer cell types. Germline (e.g. m.10398A>G; m.6253T>C) and somatic mtDNA mutations as well as differences in mtDNA copy number seem to be associated with cancer risk. It seems that mtDNA can contribute as driver or as complementary gene mutation according to the multiple-hit model. This can enhance the mutagenic/clonogenic potential of the cell as observed for m.8993T>G or influences the metastatic potential in later stages of cancer progression. Alternatively, other mtDNA variations will be innocent passenger mutations in a tumor and therefore do not contribute to the tumorigenic or metastatic potential. In this review, we discuss how reported mtDNA variations interfere with cancer treatment and what implications this has on current successful pharmaceutical interventions. Mutations in MT-ND4 and mtDNA depletion have been reported to be involved in cisplatin resistance. Pharmaceutical impairment of OXPHOS by metformin can increase the efficiency of radiotherapy. To study mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer, different cellular models (like \u03c10 cells or cybrids), in vivo murine models (xenografts and specific mtDNA mouse models in combination with a spontaneous cancer mouse model) and small animal models (e.g. Danio rerio) could be potentially interesting to use.

     "abstract": "Characterizing variability in the extent and nature of responses to environmental exposures is a critical aspect of human health risk assessment. Chemical toxicants act by many different mechanisms, however, and the genes involved in adverse outcome pathways (AOPs) and AOP networks are not yet characterized. Functional genomic approaches can reveal both toxicity pathways and susceptibility genes, through knockdown or knockout of all non-essential genes in a cell of interest, and identification of genes associated with a toxicity phenotype following toxicant exposure. Screening approaches in yeast and human near-haploid leukemic KBM7 cells have identified roles for genes and pathways involved in response to many toxicants but are limited by partial homology among yeast and human genes and limited relevance to normal diploid cells. RNA interference (RNAi) suppresses mRNA expression level but is limited by off-target effects (OTEs) and incomplete knockdown. The recently developed gene editing approach called clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats-associated nuclease (CRISPR)-Cas9, can precisely knock-out most regions of the genome at the DNA level with fewer OTEs than RNAi, in multiple human cell types, thus overcoming the limitations of the other approaches. It has been used to identify genes involved in the response to chemical and microbial toxicants in several human cell types and could readily be extended to the systematic screening of large numbers of environmental chemicals. CRISPR-Cas9 can also repress and activate gene expression, including that of non-coding RNA, with near-saturation, thus offering the potential to more fully characterize AOPs and AOP networks.

     "abstract": "DNA-damage tolerance (DDT) is an important mechanism for living cells to bypass replication blocks on the template strand. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, DDT is mediated by the RAD6 epistasis group of genes, consisting of two parallel pathways: error-prone translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), and error-free lesion bypass. The two pathways are activated by sequential ubiquitination of PCNA on the Lys164 residue. When a replication fork is stalled at a lesion, PCNA is first monoubiquitinated by Rad6\u2013Rad18, which leads to the TLS pathway. The subsequent ubiquitination by the Mms2\u2013Ubc13\u2013Rad5 complex on the monoubiquitinated PCNA is to form a Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain that promotes error-free lesion bypass. While the TLS pathway has been extensively characterized, the molecular events leading to error-free lesion bypass by polyubiquitinated PCNA are largely obscure. Furthermore, PCNA can also be sumoylated at the same Lys164 residue, which helps to recruit Srs2, a helicase and anti-recombinase. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of error-free DDT and its interplay with Srs2 and homologous recombination.",

     "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic medical imaging technique widely used to acquire detailed information about anatomy and function of different organs in the body, in both health and disease. It utilizes electromagnetic fields of three different frequency bands: static magnetic field (SMF), time-varying gradient magnetic fields (GMF) in the kHz range and pulsed radiofrequency fields (RF) in the MHz range. There have been some investigations examining the extent of genetic damage following exposure of bacterial and human cells to all three frequency bands of electromagnetic fields, as used during MRI: the rationale for these studies is the well documented evidence of positive correlation between significantly increased genetic damage and carcinogenesis. Overall, the published data were not sufficiently informative and useful because of the small sample size, inappropriate comparison of experimental groups, etc. Besides, when an increased damage was observed in MRI-exposed cells, the fate of such lesions was not further explored from multiple \u2018down-stream\u2019 events. This review provides: (i) information on the basic principles used in MRI technology, (ii) detailed experimental protocols, results and critical comments on the genetic damage investigations thus far conducted using MRI equipment and, (iii) a discussion on several gaps in knowledge in the current scientific literature on MRI. Comprehensive, international, multi-centered collaborative studies, using a common and widely used MRI exposure protocol (cardiac or brain scan) incorporating several genetic/epigenetic damage end-points as well as epidemiological investigations, in large number of individuals/patients are warranted to reduce and perhaps, eliminate uncertainties raised in genetic damage investigations in cells exposed in vitro and in vivo to MRI.",

     "abstract": "Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) is a well-studied environmental compound that requires metabolic activation to have a carcinogenic effect. The neurotoxicity of BaP has received considerably less attention than its carcinogenicity. Environmental exposure to BaP correlates with impaired learning and memory in adults, and poor neurodevelopment in children. We carried out a comprehensive literature review to examine the neurotoxicity of BaP. The data were used to identify potential point of departure (POD) values for cancer and neurotoxicity endpoints using benchmark dose (BMD) modelling to compare the utility of both endpoints in the risk assessment of BaP. The POD for neurotoxicity in rodents, based on a standard behavioural test (Morris water maze), was 0.025\u00a0mg BaP/kg-bw-day compared to 0.54\u00a0mg BaP/kg-bw-day for rodent forestomach carcinogenicity, suggesting that neurotoxic endpoints are more sensitive than cancer endpoints for health risks associated with BaP exposure. Using the limited number of published studies on this topic, we propose a preliminary mode of action (MOA) to explain BaP-induced neurotoxicity in rodents. The MOA includes: (1) BaP binding to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR); (2) AHR-dependent modulation of the transcription of N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) subunits; (3) NMDAR-mediated loss of neuronal activity and decreased long-term potentiation; and (4) compromised learning and memory. More data are needed to explore the proposed neurotoxic MOA. In addition, we consider alternative MOAs, including the hypothesis that BaP-mediated DNA damage may lead to either carcinogenicity or neurotoxicity, depending on the tissue. Our proposed MOA is intended to serve as a basis for hypothesis testing in future studies. We emphasise that further studies are needed to validate the proposed MOA, to evaluate its human relevance, and to explore other potential mechanisms of BaP neurotoxicity.",

     "abstract": "It is well established that high-dose ionising radiation causes cardiovascular diseases. In contrast, the evidence for a causal relationship between long-term risk of cardiovascular diseases after moderate doses (0.5\u20135\u00a0Gy) is suggestive and weak after low doses (<0.5\u00a0Gy). However, evidence is emerging that doses under 0.5\u00a0Gy may also increase long-term risk of cardiovascular disease. This would have major implications for radiation protection with respect to medical use of radiation for diagnostic purposes and occupational or environmental radiation exposure. Therefore, it is of great importance to gain information about the presence and possible magnitude of radiation-related cardiovascular disease risk at doses of less than 0.5\u00a0Gy. The biological mechanisms implicated in any such effects are unclear and results from epidemiological studies are inconsistent. Molecular epidemiological studies can improve the understanding of the pathogenesis and the risk estimation of radiation-induced circulatory disease at low doses. Within the European DoReMi (Low Dose Research towards Multidisciplinary Integration) project, strategies to conduct molecular epidemiological studies in this field have been developed and evaluated. Key potentially useful European cohorts are the Mayak workers, other nuclear workers, uranium miners, Chernobyl liquidators, the Techa river residents and several diagnostic or low-dose radiotherapy patient cohorts. Criteria for informative studies are given and biomarkers to be investigated suggested. A close collaboration between epidemiology, biology and dosimetry is recommended, not only among experts in the radiation field, but also those in cardiovascular diseases.",

These structures are resolved by DNA helicases and are believed to be a causal factor in the phenotype of premature ageing disorders following mutations in DNA helicase genes. The relevance of G4 structures in ageing may be further implicated by their dynamic relationship with DNA modification mechanisms. When DNA methylation and oxidation occur at the vicinity of G4 elements, they can affect the stability of G4 structures which may in turn mediate gene expression resulting in deleterious effects on genome integrity. Therefore, the influence of nutritional deficiencies or excess on oxidation and methylation mechanisms may be contributing factors affecting the stability of G4 structures and their balance in the human genome. We propose that dietary nutrients such as folate and antioxidants may play a beneficial role in reducing G4-induced DNA damage through changes in G4 structure stability. The current knowledge advocates the importance of resolving G4 structures by DNA helicases for sustained genome integrity, and the existence of stability changes in G4 structures when associated with DNA methylation and oxidation modifications.",

     "publication date": "06-2015",
     "abstract": "Non-coding DNA comprises a very large proportion of the total genomic content in higher organisms, but its function remains largely unclear. Non-coding DNA sequences constitute the majority of peripheral heterochromatin, which has been hypothesized to be the genome's \u2018bodyguard\u2019 against DNA damage from chemicals and radiation for almost four decades. The bodyguard protective function of peripheral heterochromatin in genome defense has been strengthened by the results from numerous recent studies, which are summarized in this review. These data have suggested that cells and/or organisms with a higher level of heterochromatin and more non-coding DNA sequences, including longer telomeric DNA and rDNAs, exhibit a lower frequency of DNA damage, higher radioresistance and longer lifespan after IR exposure. In addition, the majority of heterochromatin is peripherally located in the three-dimensional structure of genome organization. Therefore, the peripheral heterochromatin with non-coding DNA could play a protective role in genome defense against DNA damage from ionizing radiation by both absorbing the radicals from water radiolysis in the cytosol and reducing the energy of IR. However, the bodyguard protection by heterochromatin has been challenged by the observation that DNA damage is less frequently detected in peripheral heterochromatin than in euchromatin, which is inconsistent with the expectation and simulation results. Previous studies have also shown that the DNA damage in peripheral heterochromatin is rarely repaired and moves more quickly, broadly and outwardly to approach the nuclear pore complex (NPC). Additionally, it has been shown that extrachromosomal circular DNAs (eccDNAs) are formed in the nucleus, highly detectable in the cytoplasm (particularly under stress conditions) and shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Based on these studies, this review speculates that the sites of DNA damage in peripheral heterochromatin could occur more frequently and may be removed by repetitive elements in non-coding DNA through the formation of eccDNAs and expelled out of the nucleus to the cytoplasm via the NPC. Therefore, this review proposes that the genome and central protein-coding sequences are doubly protected by non-coding DNA in peripheral heterochromatin against DNA damage from radiation, which may be a novel protective role of non-coding DNA in genome defense.",

     "abstract": "Ku is an abundant, highly conserved DNA binding protein found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes that plays essential roles in the maintenance of genome integrity. In eukaryotes, Ku is a heterodimer comprised of two subunits, Ku70 and Ku80, that is best characterized for its central role as the initial DNA end binding factor in the \u201cclassical\u201d non-homologous end joining (C-NHEJ) pathway, the main DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair pathway in mammals. Ku binds double-stranded DNA ends with high affinity in a sequence-independent manner through a central ring formed by the intertwined strands of the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits. At the break, Ku directly and indirectly interacts with several C-NHEJ factors and processing enzymes, serving as the scaffold for the entire DNA repair complex. There is also evidence that Ku is involved in signaling to the DNA damage response (DDR) machinery to modulate the activation of cell cycle checkpoints and the activation of apoptosis. Interestingly, Ku is also associated with telomeres, where, paradoxically to its DNA end-joining functions, it protects the telomere ends from being recognized as DSBs, thereby preventing their recombination and degradation. Ku, together with the silent information regulator (Sir) complex is also required for transcriptional silencing through telomere position effect (TPE). How Ku associates with telomeres, whether it is through direct DNA binding, or through protein\u2013protein interactions with other telomere bound factors remains to be determined. Ku is central to the protection of organisms through its participation in C-NHEJ to repair DSBs generated during V(D)J recombination, a process that is indispensable for the establishment of the immune response. Ku also functions to prevent tumorigenesis and senescence since Ku-deficient mice show increased cancer incidence and early onset of aging. Overall, Ku function is critical to the maintenance of genomic integrity and to proper cellular and organismal development.",

New technologies have changed the composition of transportation methods considerably, reducing emissions of many of the components of health concern. The similarity of modern diesel and gasoline fuels and emissions to other carbonaceous fuels and emissions is striking. Recently an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Group concluded that there was sufficient evidence in humans for the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust (Group 1). In addition, the Working Group found that diesel exhaust has \u201ca positive association (limited evidence) with an increased risk of bladder cancer.\u201d Like most other carbonaceous fuel emissions, diesel and gasoline exhausts contain toxic levels of respirable particles (PM <2.5\u00a0\u03bcm) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, the level of toxic components in exhausts from diesel and gasoline emissions has declined in certain regions over time because of changes in engine design, the development of better aftertreatment devices (e.g., catalysts), increased fuel economy, changes in the fuels and additives used, and greater regulation.

     "abstract": "As seen through the previous reviews, each carbonaceous source of energy is associated with genotoxic and carcinogenic health risks; however, energy use is central to human society and provides many health benefits. These reviews examined the genotoxicity of carbonaceous sources of energy, focusing on the impacts due to the combustion of fuels and biomass. In previous reviews, information and data were used to examine occupational, industrial, household, and general environmental pollution as well as laboratory research. In this final summation, the effort is not only to summarize the previous reviews but to provide additional information to support any final conclusions. Included in the final observations are: (1) emissions from combusted carbonaceous fuels are very likely to include genotoxicants and/or carcinogens, and, as such, they can considerably increase the risk of adverse health effects in exposed humans, (2) environmental transformation is likely to increase genotoxicity of emissions, and (3) the world's poor households have an increased health risk because they have limited access to clean fuels and electricity. Because carbonaceous fuel emissions are highly complex, risk assessments are difficult; however, decision makers have many toxicological approaches for evaluating emissions. Although energy efficiency brings many benefits, it also involves health risks, as do renewable energy systems, if not managed carefully. The reviews do not examine climate change or non-carbonaceous fuels (e.g., nuclear fuels). Because these are not papers about the risk assessment or regulation of pollutants from carbon-based fuels, the discussions of regulations were to place research, concerns, and actions into a historical reference for the reader.",

     "abstract": "Replication fork progression is being continuously hampered by exogenously introduced and naturally occurring DNA lesions and other physical obstacles. Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is activated at replication forks that encounter damaged DNA. Subsequently, Chk1 inhibits the initiation of new replication factories and stimulates the firing of dormant origins (those in the vicinity of stalled forks). Chk1 also avoids fork collapse into DSBs (double strand breaks) and promotes fork elongation. At the molecular level, the current model considers stalled forks as the site of Chk1 activation and the nucleoplasm as the location where Chk1 phosphorylates target proteins. This model certainly serves to explain how Chk1 modulates origin firing, but how Chk1 controls the fate of stalled forks is less clear. Interestingly, recent reports demonstrating that Chk1 phosphorylates chromatin-bound proteins and even holds kinase-independent functions might shed light on how Chk1 contributes to the elongation of damaged DNA. Indeed, such findings have unveiled a puzzling connection between Chk1 and DNA lesion bypass, which might be central to promoting fork elongation and checkpoint attenuation. In summary, Chk1 is a multifaceted and versatile signaling factor that acts at ongoing forks and replication origins to determine the extent and quality of the cellular response to replication stress.",

     "abstract": "In genetic toxicology, risk assessment has traditionally adopted linear dose\u2013responses for any compound that causes genotoxic effects. Increasing evidence of non-linear dose\u2013responses, however, suggests potential cellular tolerance to low levels of many genotoxicants with diverse modes of action. Such putative non-linear dose\u2013responses need to be substantiated by strong mechanistic data that identifies the mechanisms responsible for the tolerance to low doses. This can be achieved by experimental demonstration of cytoprotective mechanisms and by providing experimental support for the existence of tolerance mechanisms against low dose effects. By highlighting key experiments into low dose mechanisms, this review aims to clarify which mechanistic data are required to support the use of non-linear dose\u2013response models in risk assessment. Such key experiments are presented and discussed for alkylating agents, oxidants, particulate matter, nucleoside analogues, topoisomerase inhibitors and aneugens and exemplify the use of gene knockout models or transgenic models as well as chemical modulators of key effectors of relevant pathways and their impact on dose\u2013response relationships. In vitro studies are particularly valuable to elucidate mechanisms of low-dose protection or lack thereof, while in vivo experiments are most appropriate for deriving a safe dose. In order to evaluate the existence of non-linear dose\u2013response relationships for genotoxicants, we suggest that careful attention should be given to the mode of genotoxic action, relevant biomarkers of exposure, as well as to the existence and impact of potential cytoprotective mechanisms like detoxifying metabolism and DNA repair.",

     "abstract": "Non-coding RNAs play a crucial role in maintaining genomic stability which is essential for cell survival and preventing tumorigenesis. Through an extensive crosstalk between non-coding RNAs and the canonical DNA damage response (DDR) signaling pathway, DDR-induced expression of non-coding RNAs can provide a regulatory mechanism to accurately control the expression of DNA damage responsive genes in a spatio-temporal manner. Mechanistically, DNA damage alters expression of a variety of non-coding RNAs at multiple levels including transcriptional regulation, post-transcriptional regulation, and RNA degradation. In parallel, non-coding RNAs can directly regulate cellular processes involved in DDR by altering expression of their targeting genes, with a particular emphasis on miRNAs and lncRNAs. MiRNAs are required for almost every aspect of cellular responses to DNA damage, including sensing DNA damage, transducing damage signals, repairing damaged DNA, activating cell cycle checkpoints, and inducing apoptosis. As for lncRNAs, they control transcription of DDR relevant gene by four different regulatory models, including signal, decoy, guide, and scaffold. In addition, we also highlight potential clinical applications of non-coding RNAs as biomarkers and therapeutic targets for anti-cancer treatments using DNA-damaging agents including radiation and chemotherapy. Although tremendous advances have been made to elucidate the role of non-coding RANs in genome maintenance, many key questions remain to be answered including mechanistically how non-coding RNA pathway and DNA damage response pathway is coordinated in response to genotoxic stress.",

     "abstract": "Oxidatively induced DNA damage is caused in living organisms by endogenous and exogenous reactive species. DNA lesions resulting from this type of damage are mutagenic and cytotoxic and, if not repaired, can cause genetic instability that may lead to disease processes including carcinogenesis. Living organisms possess DNA repair mechanisms that include a variety of pathways to repair multiple DNA lesions. Mutations and polymorphisms also occur in DNA repair genes adversely affecting DNA repair systems. Cancer tissues overexpress DNA repair proteins and thus develop greater DNA repair capacity than normal tissues. Increased DNA repair in tumors that removes DNA lesions before they become toxic is a major mechanism for development of resistance to therapy, affecting patient survival. Accumulated evidence suggests that DNA repair capacity may be a predictive biomarker for patient response to therapy. Thus, knowledge of DNA protein expressions in normal and cancerous tissues may help predict and guide development of treatments and yield the best therapeutic response. DNA repair proteins constitute targets for inhibitors to overcome the resistance of tumors to therapy. Inhibitors of DNA repair for combination therapy or as single agents for monotherapy may help selectively kill tumors, potentially leading to personalized therapy. Numerous inhibitors have been developed and are being tested in clinical trials. The efficacy of some inhibitors in therapy has been demonstrated in patients. Further development of inhibitors of DNA repair proteins is globally underway to help eradicate cancer.",

The DNA damage incurred during the inflammatory response triggers the activation of DNA repair pathways, which are required for host-cell survival. Here, we reviewed current understanding of the mechanism by which DNA repair contributes to protection against the oxidized DNA damage generated during infectious and inflammatory diseases and its involvement in innate and adaptive immunity. We discussed the functional role of DNA repair enzymes in the immune activation and the relevance of these processes to: transcriptional regulation of cytokines and other genes involved in the inflammatory response; V(D)J recombination; class-switch recombination (CSR); and somatic hypermutation (SHM). These three last processes of DNA damage repair are required for effective humoral adaptive immunity, creating genetic diversity in developing T and B cells. Furthermore, viral replication is also dependent on host DNA repair mechanisms. Therefore, the elucidation of the pathways of DNA damage and its repair that activate innate and adaptive immunity will be important for a better understanding of the immune and inflammatory disorders and developing new therapeutic interventions for treatment of these diseases and for improving their outcome.",

     "abstract": "Bifunctional alkylating and platinum based drugs are chemotherapeutic agents used to treat cancer. These agents induce DNA adducts via formation of intrastrand or interstrand (ICL) DNA crosslinks, and DNA lesions of the ICL type are particularly toxic as they block DNA replication and/or DNA transcription. However, the therapeutic efficacies of these drugs are frequently limited due to the cancer cell's enhanced ability to repair and tolerate these toxic DNA lesions. This ability to tolerate and survive the DNA damage is accomplished by a set of specialized low fidelity DNA polymerases called translesion synthesis (TLS) polymerases since high fidelity DNA polymerases are unable to replicate the damaged DNA template. TLS is a crucial initial step in ICL repair as it synthesizes DNA across the lesion thus preparing the damaged DNA template for repair by the homologous recombination (HR) pathway and Fanconi anemia (FA) network, processes critical for ICL repair. Here we review the molecular features and functional roles of TLS polymerases, discuss the collaborative interactions and cross-regulation of the TLS DNA damage tolerance pathway, the FA network and the BRCA-dependent HRR pathway, and the impact of TLS hyperactivation on development of chemoresistance. Finally, since TLS hyperactivation results from overexpression of Rad6/Rad18 ubiquitinating enzymes (fundamental components of the TLS pathway), increased PCNA ubiquitination, and/or increased recruitment of TLS polymerases, the potential benefits of selectively targeting critical components of the TLS pathway for enhancing anti-cancer therapeutic efficacy and curtailing chemotherapy-induced mutagenesis are also discussed.",

Elg1 is evolutionarily conserved, and its mammalian ortholog (also known as ATAD5) is embryonic lethal when lost in mice, acts as a tumor suppressor in mice and humans, exhibits physical interactions with components of the human Fanconi Anemia pathway and may be responsible for some of the phenotypes associated with neurofibromatosis.

     "abstract": "Radiation proteomics is a recent, promising and powerful tool to identify protein markers of direct and indirect consequences of ionizing radiation. The main challenges of modern radiobiology is to predict radio-sensitivity of patients and radio-resistance of tumor to be treated, but considerable evidences are now available regarding the significance of a bystander effect at low and high doses. This \u201cradiation-induced bystander effect\u201d (RIBE) is defined as the biological responses of non-irradiated cells that received signals from neighboring irradiated cells. Such intercellular signal is no more considered as a minor side-effect of radiotherapy in surrounding healthy tissue and its occurrence should be considered in adapting radiotherapy protocols, to limit the risk for radiation-induced secondary cancer. There is no consensus on a precise designation of RIBE, which involves a number of distinct signal-mediated effects within or outside the irradiated volume. Indeed, several cellular mechanisms were proposed, including the secretion of soluble factors by irradiated cells in the extracellular matrix, or the direct communication between irradiated and neighboring non-irradiated cells via gap junctions. This phenomenon is observed in a context of major local inflammation, linked with a global imbalance of oxidative metabolism which makes its analysis challenging using in vitro model systems.In this review article, the authors first define the radiation-induced bystander effect as a function of radiation type, in vitro analysis protocols, and cell type. In a second time, the authors present the current status of protein biomarkers and proteomic-based findings and discuss the capacities, limits and perspectives of such global approaches to explore these complex intercellular mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Alkylating agents, which are widespread in the environment, also occur endogenously as primary and secondary metabolites. Such compounds have intrinsically extremely cytotoxic and frequently mutagenic effects, to which organisms have developed resistance by evolving multiple repair mechanisms to protect cellular DNA. One such defense against alkylation lesions is an inducible Adaptive (Ada) response. In Escherichia coli, the Ada response enhances cell resistance by the biosynthesis of four proteins: Ada, AlkA, AlkB, and AidB. The glycosidic bonds of the most cytotoxic lesion, N3-methyladenine (3meA), together with N3-methylguanine (3meG), O2-methylthymine (O2-meT), and O2-methylcytosine (O2-meC), are cleaved by AlkA DNA glycosylase. Lesions such as N1-methyladenine (1meA) and N3-methylcytosine (3meC) are removed from DNA and RNA by AlkB dioxygenase. Cytotoxic and mutagenic O6-methylguanine (O6meG) is repaired by Ada DNA methyltransferase, which transfers the methyl group onto its own cysteine residue from the methylated oxygen. We review (i) the individual Ada proteins Ada, AlkA, AlkB, AidB, and COG3826, with emphasis on the ubiquitous and versatile AlkB and its prokaryotic and eukaryotic homologs; (ii) the organization of the Ada regulon in several bacterial species; (iii) the mechanisms underlying activation of Ada transcription. In vivo and in silico analysis of various microorganisms shows the widespread existence and versatile organization of Ada regulon genes, including not only ada, alkA, alkB, and aidB but also COG3826, alkD, and other genes whose roles in repair of alkylated DNA remain to be elucidated.

While these new and enigmatic players in the complex transcriptional milieu are encoded by a significant proportion of the genome, their functions are mostly unknown at present. Existing examples suggest that lncRNAs have fulfilled a wide variety of regulatory roles at almost every stage of gene expression. These roles, which encompass signal, decoy, scaffold and guide capacities, derive from folded modular domains in lncRNAs. Early discoveries support a paradigm in which lncRNAs regulate transcription networks via chromatin modulation, but new functions are steadily emerging. Given the biochemical versatility of RNA, lncRNAs may be used for various tasks, including posttranscriptional processing. In addition, long intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs) are strongly enriched for trait-associated SNPs, which suggest a new mechanism by which intergenic trait-associated regions might function. Moreover, multiple lines of evidence increasingly link mutations and dysregulations of lncRNAs to diverse human diseases, especially disorders related to aging. In this article, we review the current state of the knowledge of the lncRNA field, discussing what is known about the genomic contexts, biological functions and mechanisms of action of these molecules. We highlight the growing evidence for the importance of lncRNAs in diverse human disorders and the indications that their dysregulations and mutations underlie some aging-related disorders.

     "abstract": "Metabolism is critical for the mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and other adverse health effects of trichloroethylene (TCE). Despite the relatively small size and simple chemical structure of TCE, its metabolism is quite complex, yielding multiple intermediates and end-products. Experimental animal and human data indicate that TCE metabolism occurs through two major pathways: cytochrome P450 (CYP)-dependent oxidation and glutathione (GSH) conjugation catalyzed by GSH S-transferases (GSTs). Herein we review recent data characterizing TCE processing and flux through these pathways. We describe the catalytic enzymes, their regulation and tissue localization, as well as the evidence for transport and inter-organ processing of metabolites. We address the chemical reactivity of TCE metabolites, highlighting data on mutagenicity of these end-products. Identification in urine of key metabolites, particularly trichloroacetate (TCA), dichloroacetate (DCA), trichloroethanol and its glucuronide (TCOH and TCOG), and N-acetyl-S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)-l-cysteine (NAcDCVC), in exposed humans and other species (mostly rats and mice) demonstrates function of the two metabolic pathways in vivo. The CYP pathway primarily yields chemically stable end-products. However, the GST pathway conjugate S-(1,2-dichlorovinyl)glutathione (DCVG) is further processed to multiple highly reactive species that are known to be mutagenic, especially in kidney where in situ metabolism occurs. TCE metabolism is highly variable across sexes, species, tissues and individuals. Genetic polymorphisms in several of the key enzymes metabolizing TCE and its intermediates contribute to variability in metabolic profiles and rates. In all, the evidence characterizing the complex metabolism of TCE can inform predictions of adverse responses including mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and acute and chronic organ-specific toxicity.",

     "abstract": "The first micronucleus (MN) study with urine derived cells (UDC) appeared 30 years ago. So far, 56 investigations have been published with this method and it was shown that it can be used for the detection of chromosomal damage caused by environmental and lifestyle factors as well as by occupational exposures and certain diseases This approach may be also useful as a diagnostic tool for the detection and prognosis of bladder cancer. The test system has been improved in the last years, i.e., it was shown that, apart from MN also other nuclear anomalies can be evaluated in UDC which are found in other types of epithelial cells as well (e.g., in oral and nasal cells) and are indicative for acute toxicity (pyknosis, karyorrhexis, karyolysis, condensed chromatin) and genomic instability (nuclear buds, binucleates). Furthermore, an improved protocol with Carnoy I fixation and Papanicolaou stain was developed which enables the discrimination between cells which originate from the cervix and those from the urothelium. The evaluation of the currently available results indicates that exposures and health conditions which are associated with increased cancer rates in the bladder (and possibly also in other organs) lead to positive results in MN-UDC assays and a limited number of studies indicate that this method may be equally sensitive as other more frequently used human biomonitoring assays. The major shortcoming of the UDC-MN method is the lack of standardization; the evaluation of the current data shows that a variety of staining and fixation methods are used and that the numbers of evaluated cells vary over a broad range. These inconsistencies may account for the large inter-laboratory variations of the background frequencies. In order to improve the reliability of the method, further standardization and validation is required. Therefore an international program should be initiated in which a similar strategy could be used as in previous validation/standardization projects concerning MN-cytome assays with lymphocytes and buccal cells.",

     "abstract": "Eukaryotic cells utilize various RNA quality control mechanisms to ensure high fidelity of gene expression, thus protecting against the accumulation of nonfunctional RNA and the subsequent production of abnormal peptides. Messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are largely responsible for protein production, and mRNA quality control is particularly important for protecting the cell against the downstream effects of genetic mutations. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is an evolutionarily conserved mRNA quality control system in all eukaryotes that degrades transcripts containing premature termination codons (PTCs). By degrading these aberrant transcripts, NMD acts to prevent the production of truncated proteins that could otherwise harm the cell through various insults, such as dominant negative effects or the ER stress response. Although NMD functions to protect the cell against the deleterious effects of aberrant mRNA, there is a growing body of evidence that mutation-, codon-, gene-, cell-, and tissue-specific differences in NMD efficiency can alter the underlying pathology of genetic disease. In addition, the protective role that NMD plays in genetic disease can undermine current therapeutic strategies aimed at increasing the production of full-length functional protein from genes harboring nonsense mutations. Here, we review the normal function of this RNA surveillance pathway and how it is regulated, provide current evidence for the role that it plays in modulating genetic disease phenotypes, and how NMD can be used as a therapeutic target.",

     "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major global health problem and many studies have underlined the importance of inter individual variability and somatic mutations during the clinical course of HBV infection. In recent years, high-throughput technologies have provided new possibilities to study the genetic basis of many diseases. We reviewed all literature available on genome-wide association studies (GWASs), whole genome, exome and RNA sequencing studies as well as studies on HBV infection and the pathogenesis of related liver disease. Many GWASs conclude that the genetic variants in the HLA region (HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR and MICA), KIF1B, DEPDC5 and PNPLA3 influence HBV infection, its clinical course and the response to hepatitis B vaccination. The next generation sequencing approach provides important clues on the mutational landscape of genes involved in signaling pathways in particular JAK/STAT, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin, p53 pathways and multiple chromatin regulator genes that significantly promote hepatocarcinogenesis. In addition, the hotspots of recurrent integrations of HBV-DNA into host chromosomes such as hTERT, PDGF receptor, MLL are involved in pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Additionally, the transitions T\u00a0>\u00a0C/A\u00a0>\u00a0G, C\u00a0>\u00a0T/G\u00a0>\u00a0A, C\u00a0>\u00a0A/G\u00a0>\u00a0T and T\u00a0>\u00a0A/A\u00a0>\u00a0T remain specific for HCC induced by viral infection and the DNA methylation in the CpG island is proposed as a biomarker for HCC. We have described common mutations in the HBV genome (G1896A, rtM204V, rtM204I) which modulate the pathogenesis and carcinogenesis of the liver. Further GWASs in different ethnic groups and additional functional studies are required to warrant the significance of such defined genetic factors. Such findings continue to shape our understanding of the genetic architecture of host\u2013virus interactions and provide new clues and directions in determining genetic markers that modulate HBV infection and related liver diseases. The studies using high-throughput technologies help identifying potential genetic threats however the utility of mutational information can be complex in predicting prognostic significance and shall pose challenges to its clinical implementation.",

The reviews will concentrate on petroleum-derived fuels and biofuels. Although the length of these papers may cause the reader to think otherwise, the coverage of published works is intended to be illustrative rather than exhaustive and is intended for a multidisciplinary audience. This series of papers is not a risk assessment; instead, it is an attempt to introduce the reader with the history and terminology needed when examining fuels and emissions for genotoxic effects. The purpose of this particular paper is to provide a background for the other papers (both within this series and within papers by others) and to establish some principles used in these reviews.

These substances are carcinogenic in experimental animals, and epidemiological studies implicate these fuels (especially their emissions) as carcinogens in man. Globally, \u223c50% of all households and \u223c90% of all rural households use solid fuels for cooking or heating and these fuels often are burnt in simple stoves with very incomplete combustion. Exposed women and children often exhibit low birth weight, increased infant and perinatal mortality, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer although few studies have measured exposure directly. Today, households that cannot meet the expense of fuels like kerosene, liquefied petroleum gas, and electricity resort to collecting wood, agricultural residue, and animal dung to use as household fuels. In the more developed countries, solid fuels are often used for electric power generation providing more than half of the electricity generated in the United States. The world's coal reserves, which equal approximately one exagram, equal \u223c1 trillion barrels of crude oil (comparable to all the world's known oil reserves) and could last for 600 years. Studies show that the PAHs that are identified in solid fuel emissions react with NO2 to form direct-acting mutagens. In summary, many of the measured genotoxicants found in both the indoor and electricity-generating combustors are the same; therefore, the severity of the health effects vary with exposure and with the health status of the exposed population.",

A comprehensive review of the 71 reported cases of breast implant associated ALCL (iALCL) is presented indicating the apparent risk factors and main characteristics of this rare cancer. The average patient is 50 years of age and most cases present in the capsule surrounding the implant as part of the periprosthetic fluid or the capsule itself on average at 10 years post-surgery suggesting that iALCL is a late complication. The absolute risk is low ranging from 1:500,000 to 1:3,000,000 patients with breast implants per year. The majority of cases are ALK-negative, yet are associated with silicone-coated implants suggestive of the mechanism of tumorigenesis which is discussed in relation to chronic inflammation, immunogenicity of the implants and sub-clinical infection. In particular, capsulotomy alone seems to be sufficient for the treatment of many cases suggesting the implants provide the biological stimulus whereas others require further treatment including chemo- and radiotherapy although reported cases remain too low to recommend a therapeutic approach.

     "abstract": "Generation of oxidatively damaged DNA by particulate matter (PM) is hypothesized to occur via production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflammation. We investigated this hypothesis by comparing ROS production, inflammation and oxidatively damaged DNA in different experimental systems investigating air pollution particles. There is substantial evidence indicating that exposure to air pollution particles was associated with elevated levels of oxidatively damaged nucleobases in circulating blood cells and urine from humans, which is supported by observations of elevated levels of genotoxicity in cultured cells exposed to similar PM. Inflammation is most pronounced in cultured cells and animal models, whereas an elevated level of oxidatively damaged DNA is more pronounced than inflammation in humans. There is non-congruent data showing corresponding variability in effect related to PM sampled at different locations (spatial variability), times (temporal variability) or particle size fraction across different experimental systems of acellular conditions, cultured cells, animals and humans. Nevertheless, there is substantial variation in the genotoxic, inflammation and oxidative stress potential of PM sampled at different locations or times. Small air pollution particles did not appear more hazardous than larger particles, which is consistent with the notion that constituents such as metals and organic compounds also are important determinants for PM-generated oxidative stress and inflammation. In addition, the results indicate that PM-mediated ROS production is involved in the generation of inflammation and activated inflammatory cells can increase their ROS production. The observations indicate that air pollution particles generate oxidatively damaged DNA by promoting a milieu of oxidative stress and inflammation.",

In mammals, this novel epigenetic marker is derived from 5-methylcytosine (5mC) in a process catalyzed by ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes. Although 5hmC has only been subjected to study for a short while, a great deal of data has been accumulated regarding its generation, distribution, demethylation, function, and disease implications. All this information suggested that 5hmC acts not only as an intermediate in the DNA demethylation process but also as an independent epigenetic marker, playing an important role in the regulation of gene expression.

In HspB1, HspB3, and HspB8 all known mutations cause motor neuropathies, whereas in HspB5 they cause myopathies. Several features are common to the majority of these mutations: (i) they are missense mutations, (ii) most associated disease phenotypes exhibit a dominant inheritance pattern and late disease onset, (iii) in the primary protein sequences, the sites of most mutations are located in the conserved \u03b1-crystallin domain and the variable C-terminal extensions, and (iv) most human mutation sites are highly conserved among the vertebrate orthologs and have been historically exposed to significant purifying selection. In contrast, a minor fraction of these mutations deviate from these rules: they are (i) frame shifting, nonsense, or elongation mutations, (ii) associated with recessive or early onset disease phenotypes, (iii) positioned in the N-terminal domain of the proteins, and (iv) less conserved among the vertebrates and were historically not subject to a strong selective pressure. In several vertebrate sHSPs (including primate sHSPs), homologous sites differ from the human sequence and occasionally even encode the same amino acid residues that cause the disease in humans. Apparently, a number of these mutations sites are not crucial for the protein function in single species or entire taxa, and single species even seem to have adopted mechanisms that compensate for potentially adverse effects of \u2018mutant-like\u2019 sHSPs. The disease-associated dominant sHSP missense mutations have a number of cellular consequences that are consistent with gain-of-function mechanisms of genetic dominance: dominant-negative effects, the formation of cytotoxic amyloid protein oligomers and precipitates, disruption of cytoskeletal networks, and increased downstream enzymatic activities. Future therapeutic concepts should aim for reducing these adverse effects of mutant sHSPs in patients. Indeed, initial experimental results are encouraging.",

     "abstract": "Despite advances in treatment, prognosis for many types of carcinoma remains poor. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) has been explored as a target for the development of anticancer drugs. As a mitotic master Ser/Thr kinase, Plk1 is involved in centrosomal maturation, microtubule nucleation, chromosomal segregation, and cytokinesis. Additional functions in interphase and in response to DNA damage have been revealed. The multiple locations of Plk1 correspond to distinct functions, mediated by phosphorylation of multiple substrates. Since it is highly expressed in several carcinomas, and expression of Plk1 is inversely correlated with the survival rate of patients in non-small cell lung, head and neck, and esophageal cancer, Plk1 is recognized as a valid prognostic marker. Connections between Plk1 and p53 or KRAS in carcinoma provide a rationale and several possible routes to the development of therapies. Tumors with both p53-deficiency and high Plk1 expression may be particularly sensitive to Plk1 inhibitors, although some controversial data exist. In KRAS-mutant cancers, on the other hand, Plk1 may be essential for tumor cell survival, but detailed studies as to whether Plk1 inhibitors are more effective in KRAS-mutant cancers must be performed in order to determine whether this is the case. Here, we present evidence for Plk1 as a prognostic marker and potentially effective target for the treatment of patients with carcinoma, to demonstrate the value of Plk1 as a target for the development of cancer treatment, especially for patients with solid tumors. In addition, the effects of Plk1 inhibition in p53- or KRAS-mutated cancer are discussed with respect to clinical implications. Structural specifics of Plk1 are presented, as well as current strategies for discovering new Plk1 inhibitors by targeting the conserved ATP binding site or polo-box domain of Plk1, in order to develop Plk1-specific anticancer drugs.",

Most physical and chemical leukemia-inducing agents such as the therapeutic alkylating agents, topoisomerase II inhibitors, and ionizing radiation induce mainly acute myeloid leukemia through DNA-damaging mechanisms that result in either gene or chromosomal mutations. In contrast, biological agents and a few immunosuppressive chemicals induce primarily lymphoid neoplasms through mechanisms that involve alterations in immune response. Among the environmental agents examined, benzene was clearly associated with acute myeloid leukemia in humans, with increasing but still limited evidence for an association with lymphoid neoplasms. Ethylene oxide and 1,3-butadiene were linked primarily to lymphoid cancers. Although the association between formaldehyde and leukemia remains controversial, several recent evaluations have indicated a potential link between formaldehyde and acute myeloid leukemia. The four environmental agents examined in detail were all genotoxic, inducing gene mutations, chromosomal alterations, and/or micronuclei in vivo. Although it is clear that rapid progress has been made in recent years in our understanding of leukemogenesis, many questions remain for future research regarding chemically induced leukemias and lymphomas, including the mechanisms by which the environmental agents reviewed here induce these diseases and the risks associated with exposures to such agents.",

     "abstract": "It is well established that ionizing radiation induces chromosomal damage, both following direct radiation exposure and via non-targeted (bystander) effects, activating DNA damage repair pathways, of which the proteins are closely linked to telomeric proteins and telomere maintenance. Long-term propagation of this radiation-induced chromosomal damage during cell proliferation results in chromosomal instability. Many studies have shown the link between radiation exposure and radiation-induced changes in oxidative stress and DNA damage repair in both targeted and non-targeted cells. However, the effect of these factors on telomeres, long established as guardians of the genome, still remains to be clarified. In this review, we will focus on what is known about how telomeres are affected by exposure to low- and high-LET ionizing radiation and during proliferation, and will discuss how telomeres may be a key player in the process of radiation-induced carcinogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Anti-cancer drugs are chemotherapeutic agents that are designed to kill or reduce proliferating cells. Often times, they interfere directly or indirectly with the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Some of these drugs can be detected in the ng/L concentration range in the aquatic environment and have the potential to be very persistent. Environmental risk assessment is available for only a few anti-cancer drugs, derived mainly from predicted data and excluding information on their metabolites and transformation products (TPs). Notably, there is no defined strategy for genotoxicity risk assessment of anti-cancer drugs, their metabolites and TPs in the environment. In fact, the presence of anti-cancer drugs in hospital and municipal wastewaters has not been clearly related to the genotoxic nature of these wastewaters. The few available studies that have sought to investigate the genotoxicity of mixtures derived from treating anti-cancer drugs prior to disposal seem to share the commonality of coupling analytical methods to measure concentration and genotoxic bioassays, namely the Ames test to monitor inactivation. Such limited studies on the environmental fate and effects of these drugs presents an area for further research work. Most importantly, there is a need to characterize the genotoxic effects of anti-cancer drugs towards aquatic organisms. Given current environmental risk assessment strategies, genotoxicity risk assessment of these drugs and their TPs would have to include a combination of appropriate analytical methods, genotoxicity bioassays, (bio) degradability and computer based prediction methods such as QSAR studies.",

     "abstract": "Adaptive response is a phenomenon in which cells which were pre-exposed to extremely low and non-toxic doses of a genotoxic agent became resistant to the damage induced by subsequent exposure to a higher and toxic dose of the same, similar (in action) or another genotoxic agent. Such response has been well documented in scientific literature in cells exposed in vitro and in vivo to low doses of physical (especially, ionizing radiation) and chemical mutagens. The existence of similar phenomenon in mammalian cells exposed in vitro and in vivo to non-ionizing radiofrequency fields has been reported in several research publications. In in vitro studies, human blood lymphocytes exposed to radiofrequency fields and then treated with a genotoxic mutagen or subjected to ionizing radiation showed significantly decreased genetic damage. Similar studies in tumor cells showed significantly increased viability, decreased apoptosis, increased mitochondrial membrane potential, decreased intracellular free Ca2+ and, increased Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase activity. In in vivo studies, exposure of rodents to radiofrequency fields and then to lethal/sub-lethal doses of \u03b3-radiation showed survival advantage, significantly decreased damage in hematopoietic tissues, decreased genetic damage in blood leukocytes and bone marrow cells, increased numbers of colony forming units in bone marrow, increased levels of colony stimulating factor and interleukin-3 in the serum and increased expression of genes related to cell cycle. These observations suggested the ability of radiofrequency fields to induce adaptive response and also indicated some potential mechanisms for the induction of such response.

     "abstract": "The interindividual differences in risk of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-associated gastric cancer involve significant heterogeneities of both host genetics and H. pylori strains. Several recent studies proposed a distinct sequence for H. pylori exerting its virulence in the host stomach: (i) adhering to and colonizing the surface of gastric epithelial cells, (ii) evading and attenuating the host defense, and (iii) invading and damaging the gastric mucosa. This review focuses on several key issues that still need to be clarified, such as which virulence factors of H. pylori are involved in the three pathogenic steps, which host genes respond to the step-specific virulence factors, and whether and/or how the corresponding host genetic variations influence the risk of gastric carcinogenesis. Urease, BabA and SabA in the adhesion-step, PGN and LPS in the immune evasion-step, and CagA, VacA and Tip\u03b1 in the mucosal damage-step were documented to play an important role in step-specific pathogenicity of H. pylori infection. There is evidence further supporting a role of potentially functional polymorphisms of host genes directly responding to these pathogenic step-specific virulence factors in the susceptibility of gastric carcinogenesis, especially for urease-interacting HLA class II genes, BabA-interacting MUC1, PGN-interacting NOD1, LPS-interacting TLR4, and CagA-interacting PTPN11 and CDH1. With the continuous improvement of understanding the genetic profile of H. pylori-associated gastric carcinogenesis, a person at increased risk for gastric cancer may benefit from several aspects of efforts: (i) prevent H. pylori infection with a vaccine targeting certain step-specific virulence factor; (ii) eradicate H. pylori infection by blocking step-specific psychopathological characteristics of virulence factors; and (iii) adjust host physiological function to resist the carcinogenic role of step-specific virulence factors or interrupt the cellular signal transduction of the interplay between H. pylori and host in each pathogenic step, especially for the subjects with precancerous lesions in the stomach.",

In spite of these difficulties, it is appropriate to carry out a pooled analysis of all available comet assay biomonitoring data, in order to establish baseline parameters of DNA damage, and to investigate associations between comet assay measurements and factors such as sex, age, smoking status, nutrition, lifestyle, etc. With this as its major objective, the ComNet project has recruited almost 100 research groups willing to share datasets. Here we provide a background to this project, discussing the history of the comet assay and practical issues that can critically affect its performance. We survey its diverse applications in biomonitoring studies, including environmental and occupational exposure to genotoxic agents, genoprotection by dietary and other factors, DNA damage associated with various diseases, and intrinsic factors that affect DNA damage levels in humans.

Remarkably, the same mutations inhibit chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation in developing bones, resulting in skeletal dysplasias, such as hypochondroplasia, achondroplasia, SADDAN and thanatophoric dysplasia. A similar phenotype is observed in Noonan syndrome, Leopard syndrome, hereditary gingival fibromatosis, neurofibromatosis type 1, Costello syndrome, Legius syndrome and cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome. Collectively termed RASopathies, the latter syndromes are caused by germline mutations in components of the RAS/ERK MAP kinase signaling pathway. This article considers the evidence suggesting that FGFR3 activation in chondrocytes mimics the activation of major oncogenes signaling via the ERK pathway. Subsequent inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation in FGFR3-related skeletal dysplasias and RASopathies is proposed to result from activation of defense mechanisms that originally evolved to safeguard mammalian organisms against cancer.",

     "abstract": "The lymphocyte cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay has been applied in hundreds of in vivo biomonitoring studies of humans exposed to genotoxic chemicals because it allows the measurement of both structural and numerical chromosome aberrations. The CBMN cytome assay version which, apart from measuring micronuclei (MN) already present in cells in vivo or expressed ex vivo, also includes measurement of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB), nuclear buds (NBUD), necrosis and apoptosis, is also increasingly being used in such studies. Because of the numerous published studies there is now a need to re-evaluate the use of MN and other biomarkers within the lymphocyte CBMN cytome assay as quantitative indicators of exposure to chemical genotoxins and the genetic hazard this may cause. This review has identified some important misconceptions as well as knowledge gaps that need to be addressed to make further progress in the proper application of this promising technique and enable its full potential to be realised. The HUMN project consortium recommends a three pronged approach to further improve the knowledge base and application of the lymphocyte CBMN cytome assay to measure DNA damage in humans exposed to chemical genotoxins: (i) a series of systematic reviews, one for each class of chemical genotoxins, of studies which have investigated the association of in vivo exposure in humans with MN, NPB and NBUD induction in lymphocytes; (ii) a comprehensive analysis of the literature to obtain new insights on the potential mechanisms by which different classes of chemicals may induce MN, NPB and NBUD in vitro and in vivo and (iii) investigation of the potential advantages of using the lymphocyte CBMN cytome assay in conjunction with other promising complementary DNA damage diagnostics to obtain an even more complete assessment of the DNA damage profile induced by in vivo exposure to chemical genotoxins in humans.",

     "abstract": "The large mouse genetics program at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is often remembered chiefly for the germ-cell mutation-rate data it generated and their uses in estimating the risk of heritable radiation damage. In fact, it soon became a multi-faceted research effort that, over a period of almost 60 years, generated a wealth of information in the areas of mammalian mutagenesis, basic genetics (later enriched by molecular techniques), cytogenetics, reproductive biology, biochemistry of germ cells, and teratology. Research in the area of germ-cell mutagenesis explored the important physical and biological factors that affect the frequency and nature of induced mutations and made several unexpected discoveries, such as the major importance of the perigametic interval (the zygote stage) for the origin of spontaneous mutations and for the sensitivity to induced genetic change. Of practical value was the discovery that ethylnitrosourea was a supermutagen for point mutations, making high-efficiency mutagenesis in the mouse feasible worldwide. Teratogenesis findings resulted in recommendations still generally accepted in radiological practice. Studies supporting the mutagenesis research added whole bodies of information about mammalian germ-cell development and about molecular targets in germ cells. The early decision to not merely count but propagate genetic variants of all sorts made possible further discoveries, such as the Y-chromosome's importance in mammalian sex determination and the identification of rare X-autosome translocations, which, in turn, led to the formulation of the single-active-X hypothesis and provided tools for studies of functional mosaicism for autosomal genes, male sterility, and chromosome-pairing mechanism. Extensive genetic and then molecular analyses of large numbers of induced specific-locus mutants resulted in fine-structure physical and correlated functional mapping of significant portions of the mouse genome and constituted a valuable source of mouse models for human genetic disorders.",

     "abstract": "Many alkylating agents are used as chemotherapeutic drugs and have a long history of clinical application. These agents inflict a wide range of DNA damage resulting in a complex cellular response. After DNA damage, cells trigger a series of signaling cascades promoting cellular survival and cell cycle blockage which enables time for DNA repair to occur. More recently, induction of autophagy has been observed in cancer cells after treatment with different DNA-targeted anticancer drugs, including alkylating agents. Several studies have demonstrated that induction of autophagy after DNA damage delays apoptotic cell death and may therefore lead to chemoresistance, which is the limiting factor for successful chemotherapy. On the other hand, depending on the extent of damage and the cellular context, the induction of autophagy may also contribute to cell death. Given these conflicting results, many studies have been conducted to better define the role of autophagy in cancer cells in response to chemotherapy. In this review, we describe the main alkylating agents used in clinical oncology as well as the cellular response they evoke with emphasis on autophagy.",

     "abstract": "While much is known about radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and their repair, the question of how deletions of different sizes arise as a result of the processing of DSBs by the cell's repair systems has not been fully answered. In order to bridge this gap between DSBs and deletions, we critically reviewed published data on mechanisms pertaining to: (a) repair of DNA DSBs (from basic studies in this area); (b) formation of naturally occurring structural variation (SV) \u2013 especially of deletions \u2013 in the human genome (from genomic studies) and (c) radiation-induced mutations and structural chromosomal aberrations in mammalian somatic cells (from radiation mutagenesis and radiation cytogenetic studies). The specific aim was to assess the relative importance of the postulated mechanisms in generating deletions in the human genome and examine whether empirical data on radiation-induced deletions in mouse germ cells are consistent with predictions of these mechanisms.The mechanisms include (a) NHEJ, a DSB repair process that does not require any homology and which functions in all stages of the cell cycle (and is of particular relevance in G0/G1); (b) MMEJ, also a DSB repair process but which requires microhomology and which presumably functions in all cell cycle stages; (c) NAHR, a recombination-based DSB repair mechanism which operates in prophase I of meiosis in germ cells; (d) MMBIR, a microhomology-mediated, replication-based mechanism which operates in the S phase of the cell cycle, and (e) strand slippage during replication (involved in the origin of small insertions and deletions (INDELs).Our analysis permits the inference that, between them, these five mechanisms can explain nearly all naturally occurring deletions of different sizes identified in the human genome, NAHR and MMBIR being potentially more versatile in this regard. With respect to radiation-induced deletions, the basic studies suggest that those arising as a result of the operation of NHEJ/MMEJ processes, as currently formulated, are expected to be relatively small. However, data on induced mutations in mouse spermatogonial stem cells (irradiation in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle and DSB repair presumed to be via NHEJ predominantly) show that most are associated with deletions of different sizes, some in the megabase range. There is thus a \u2018discrepancy\u2019 between what the basic studies suggest and the empirical observations in mutagenesis studies. This discrepancy, however, is only an apparent but not a real one. It can be resolved by considering the issue of deletions in the broader context of and in conjunction with the organization of chromatin in chromosomes and nuclear architecture, the conceptual framework for which already exists in studies carried out during the past fifteen years or so. In this paper, we specifically hypothesize that repair of DSBs induced in chromatin loops may offer a basis to explain the induction of deletions of different sizes and suggest an approach to test the hypothesis. We emphasize that the bridging of the gap between induced DSB and resulting deletions of different sizes is critical for current efforts in computational modeling of genetic risks.",

     "abstract": "Hydrogen peroxide was \u2013 and is still \u2013 considered toxic for a wide range of living organisms. Oxidative stress occurs when there is an excess of pro-oxidants over antioxidants and it has been implicated in several diseases. Catalase is involved in hydrogen peroxide catabolism and is important in defense against oxidative stress. Acatalasemia means the inherited near-total deficiency of catalase activity, usually in reference to red cell catalase. Acatalasemia was thought at first to be an asymptotic disorder. In the absence of catalase, neither the Japanese, or Hungarian acatalasemics nor acatalasemic mice had significantly increased blood glutathione peroxidase activity. In animal models, catalase deficient tissues show much slower rates of removal of extracellular hydrogen peroxide. In catalase knock-out mice, a decreased hydrogen peroxide removing capacity and increased reactive oxygen species formation were reported. Hydrogen peroxide may cause methemoglobinemia in patients with catalase deficiency. During anesthesia for a Japanese acatalasemic patient the disinfection with hydrogen peroxide solution caused severe methemoglobinemia. Patients with inherited catalase deficiency, who are treated with uric acid oxidase (rasburicase) may experience very high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and may suffer from methemoglobinemia and hemolysis. The high (18.5%) prevalence of diabetes mellitus in inherited catalase deficient individuals and the earlier (10 years) manifestation of the disease may be attributed to the oxidative damage of oxidant sensitive, insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells. Ninety-seven of 114 acatalasemics had diseases related to oxidative stress and aging. The oxidative stress due to catalase deficiency could contribute to the manifestation of diabetes while for the other diseases it may be one of the factors in their causations. In summary, inherited catalase deficiency is associated with clinical features, pathologic laboratory test results, age and oxidative stress related disorders. Rather than considering it a benign condition, it should be considered as a complicating condition for aging and oxidative stress.",

Payne's interests were stimulated by the work of Carl Eigenmann, an authority on blind cave fauna, and William Moenkhaus, who introduced Payne to fruit flies at Indiana University before Payne moved to Columbia to pursue graduate work with Morgan and Edmund Wilson. The motivations of the laboratories differed in the theories used for their work. Castle spread the word about the utility of fruit flies for research, but Payne gave Morgan his first fruit flies for research leading to the discovery of the white-eye mutation.",

     "abstract": "Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) comprises a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade various components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane. MMPs are involved in solid and hematological malignancy through modification of cell growth, activation of cancer cells and modulation of immune functions. Several polymorphisms of different MMPs such as MMP-1 (\u22121607 1G/2G), MMP-2 (\u22121306 C/T), MMP-3 (\u22121171 5A/6A) & MMP-9 (\u22121562 C/T) and their expression levels have been well documented in different types of solid cancer. These polymorphic variations were found to be associated with angiogenesis, cancer progression, invasion and metastasis. There is paucity of data available in the field of hematological malignancies. Hence the field of matrix biology of hematological malignancies is an area of active exploration. A number of MMP inhibitors (MMPIs) have been developed for the cancer treatment. The most extensively studied classes of MMP inhibitors include Batimastat, Marismastat, Salimatat, Prinomastat and Tanomastat. However, their efficacy and action have not been confirmed and more data is required. The application of one or more selective targeted MMPIs in combination with conventional anti-leukemic treatment may represent a positive approach in combat against hematopoietic malignancies. Balance of MMPs and TIMPs is altered in different malignancies and biochemical pathways. These alternations will add another dimension in the matrix biology of both solid tumor and leukemia. MMP and TIMP singly and in combination are increasingly being recognized as an important player in basic cellular biology. Exploration and exploitation of MMP and TIMP balance in various malignant and nonmalignant lesions is going to be one of the most interesting facets of future use of this system for human health care.",

Failure to detect DSB and activate appropriate DNA damage responses can cause genomic instability, leading to tumorigenesis and possibly accelerated aging. Phosphorylated histone H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) is used as a biomarker of cellular response to DSB and its potential for monitoring DNA damage and repair in human populations has been explored in this review. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed for articles, in English, on human studies reporting \u03b3H2AX as a biomarker of either DNA repair or DNA damage. A total of 68 publications were identified. Thirty-four studies (50.0%) evaluated the effect of medical procedures or treatments on \u03b3H2AX levels; 20 (29.4%) monitored \u03b3H2AX in specific pathological conditions with a case/control or case/case design; 5 studies (7.4%) evaluated the effect of environmental genotoxic exposures, and 9 (13.2%) were descriptive studies on cancer and aging. Peripheral blood lymphocytes (44.6%) or biopsies/tissue specimens (24.3%) were the most commonly used samples. \u03b3H2AX was scored by optical microscopy as immunostained foci (78%), or by flow cytometry (16%). Critical features affecting the reliability of the assay, including protocols heterogeneity, specimen, cell cycle, kinetics, study design, and statistical analysis, are hereby discussed. Because of its sensitivity, efficiency and mechanistic relevance, the \u03b3H2AX assay has great potential as a DNA damage biomarker; however, the technical and epidemiological heterogeneity highlighted in this review infer a necessity for experimental standardization of the assay.",

Exposure to AA, a nitrophenathrene carboxylic acid present in certain herbal remedies and in flour prepared from wheat grain contaminated with seeds of Aristolochia clematitis, has been linked to chronic nephropathy and UUT. TP53 mutations in UUT of individuals exposed to AA reveal a unique pattern of mutations characterized by A to T transversions on the non-transcribed strand, which cluster at hotspots rarely mutated in other cancers. This unusual pattern, originally discovered in UUTs from two different populations, one in Taiwan, and one in the Balkans, has been reproduced experimentally by treating mouse cells that harbor human TP53 sequences with AA. The convergence of molecular epidemiological and experimental data establishes a clear causal association between exposure to the human carcinogen AA and UUT.

We also assess risks in offspring of other radiation-exposed groups, in particular those of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors and occupationally and environmentally exposed groups. Experimental findings are also briefly surveyed.Animal and cellular studies tend to suggest that the irradiation of males, at least at high doses (mostly 1\u00a0Gy and above), can lead to observable effects (including both genetic and epigenetic) in the somatic cells of their offspring over several generations that are not attributable to the inheritance of a simple mutation through the parental germline. However, studies of disease in the offspring of irradiated humans have not identified any effects on health. The available evidence therefore suggests that human health has not been significantly affected by transgenerational effects of radiation. It is possible that transgenerational effects are restricted to relatively short times post-exposure and in humans conception at short times after exposure is likely to be rare. Further research that may help resolve the apparent discrepancies between cellular/animal studies and studies of human health are outlined.",

     "abstract": "UV is the most abundant human carcinogen, and protection from extensive exposure to it is a widespread human health issue. The use of chemicals (sunscreens) for protection is intuitive and efficacious. However, these chemicals may become activated to reactive intermediates when absorbing energy from UV, thus producing damage themselves, which may manifest itself in phototoxic, photoallergenic or photocarcinogenic reactions in humans. The development of safe sunscreens for humans is of high interest. Similar issues have been observed for some therapeutically used principles such as PUVA therapy for psoriasis or porphyrins for phototherapy of human cancers. Photoactivation has also been reported as a side effect of various pharmaceuticals such as the antibacterial fluoroquinolones. In this context, the authors have been involved over more than 20 years in the development and refinement of assays to test for photomutagenicity as an unwanted side effect of UV-mediated activation of such chemicals for cosmetic or pharmaceutical use. The initial years of great hopes for simple mammalian cell-based assays for photomutagenicity to screen out substances of concern for human use were followed by many years of collaborative trials to achieve standardization. However, it is now realized that this topic, albeit of human safety relevance, is highly complex and subject to many artificial modifiers, especially in vitro in mammalian cell culture. Thus, it is not really suitable for being engineered into a general testing framework within cosmetic or pharmaceutical testing guidelines. Much knowledge has been generated over the years to arrive at the conclusion that yes, photomutagenicity does exist with the use of chemicals, but how to best test for it will require a sophisticated case-by-case approach. Moreover, in comparison to the properties and risks of exposure to UV itself, it remains a comparatively minor human safety risk to address. In considering risks and benefits, we should also acknowledge beneficial effects of UV on human health, including an essential role in the production of Vitamin D. Thus, the interrelationships between UV, chemicals and human health remain a fascinating topic of research.",

Cellular DNA damage response pathways rely on a myriad of proteins interacting with DNA alterations. The cartography of this interactome currently includes well known actors of chromatin remodelling, DNA repair or proteins hijacked from their natural functions such as transcription factors. In order to go further into the characterisation of these protein networks, proteomics-based methods began to be used in the early 2000s. The strategies are diverse and include mainly (i) damaged DNA molecules used as targets on protein microarrays, (ii) damaged DNA probes used to trap within complex cellular extracts proteins that are then separated and identified by proteomics, (iii) identification of chromatin- bound proteins after a genotoxic stress, or (iv) identification of proteins associated with other proteins already known to be part of DNA damage interactome. All these approaches have already been performed to find new proteins recognizing oxidised bases, abasic sites, strand breaks or crosslinks generated by anticancer drugs such as nitrogen mustards and platinating agents. Identified interactions are generally confirmed using complementary methods such as electromobility shift assays or surface plasmon resonance. These strategies allowed, for example, demonstration of interactions between cisplatin\u2013DNA crosslinks and PARP-1 or the protein complex PTW/PP.

     "abstract": "Non-DNA targeted effects of ionising radiation, which include genomic instability, and a variety of bystander effects including abscopal effects and bystander mediated adaptive response, have raised concerns about the magnitude of low-dose radiation risk. Genomic instability, bystander effects and adaptive responses are powered by fundamental, but not clearly understood systems that maintain tissue homeostasis. Despite excellent research in this field by various groups, there are still gaps in our understanding of the likely mechanisms associated with non-DNA targeted effects, particularly with respect to systemic (human health) consequences at low and intermediate doses of ionising radiation. Other outstanding questions include links between the different non-targeted responses and the variations in response observed between individuals and cell lines, possibly a function of genetic background. Furthermore, it is still not known what the initial target and early interactions in cells are that give rise to non-targeted responses in neighbouring or descendant cells. This paper provides a commentary on the current state of the field as a result of the non-targeted effects of ionising radiation (NOTE) Integrated Project funded by the European Union. Here we critically examine the evidence for non-targeted effects, discuss apparently contradictory results and consider implications for low-dose radiation health effects.",

Genetic toxicity testing is also required by regulatory agencies to be conducted prior to initiation of first in human clinical trials and subsequent marketing for most small molecule pharmaceutical compounds. To reduce the chances of advancing mutagenic pharmaceutical candidates through the drug discovery and development processes, companies have focused on developing testing strategies to maximize hazard identification while minimizing resource expenditure due to late stage attrition. With a large number of testing options, consensus has not been reached on the best mutagenicity platform to use or on the best time to use a specific test to aid in the selection of drug candidates for development. Most companies use a process in which compounds are initially screened for mutagenicity early in drug development using tests that require only a few milligrams of compound and then follow those studies up with a more robust mutagenicity test prior to selecting a compound for full development.This review summarizes the current applications of bacterial mutagenicity assays utilized by pharmaceutical companies in early and late discovery programs. The initial impetus for this review was derived from a workshop on bacterial mutagenicity screening in the pharmaceutical industry presented at the 40th Annual Environmental Mutagen Society Meeting held in St. Louis, MO in October, 2009. However, included in this review are succinct summaries of use and interpretation of genetic toxicity assays, several mutagenicity assays that were not presented at the meeting, and updates to testing strategies resulting in current state-of the art description of best practices. In addition, here we discuss the advantages and liabilities of many broadly used mutagenicity screening platforms and strategies used by pharmaceutical companies. The sensitivity and specificity of these early mutagenicity screening assays using proprietary compounds and their concordance (predictivity) with the regulatory bacterial mutation test are discussed.",

There is accumulating evidence that hTERT (the catalytic subunit of telomerase) favours an immortal phenotype by blocking programmed cell death (apoptosis) independently of its protective function at the telomere ends. This review summarized existing evidence for the anti-apoptotic role of hTERT in the context of tumour-cell resistance against DNA damage and aims to put hTERT in the context of cell-signal-transduction pathways leading either to survival or cell death. We found evidence that telomerase is cross-linked with many different signalling pathways that regulate cell proliferation, DNA damage repair, and also cell death. Thereby, hTERT survival function seems to occur at early stages of DNA damage recognition. We found some discrepancies in the published data though. Based on our findings, we suggest further exploration is needed of the interplay of the DNA damage response signalling network, including MAPK and p53 family activation, on telomerase regulation. This interaction is probably an important factor for fine tuning of the sensitivity of the cell to genotoxic stress. Using anti-neoplastic agents, further dose relationships on timing and extent of DNA damage, cellular repair and death should be established and correlated with hTERT expression/telomerase activation. Closing the data gaps identified here could profoundly improve our understanding of the relevance of telomerase for protecting the cell against anti-cancer agents and would contribute to developing new strategies for cancer therapy.",

Unique metabolic reactions to a particular environmental stress apparently target specific genes for increased rates of transcription and mutation, resulting in higher mutation rates for those genes most likely to solve the problem. Kinetic models which have demonstrated predictive value are described and are shown to simulate mutagenesis in vivo in Escherichia coli, the p53 tumor suppressor gene, and somatic hypermutation. In all three models, direct correlations are seen between mutation frequencies and transcription rates. G and C nucleosides in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) are intrinsically mutable, and G and C silent mutations in p53 and in VH framework regions provide compelling evidence for intrinsic mechanisms of mutability, since mutation outcomes are neutral and are not selected. During transcription, the availability of unpaired bases in the ssDNA of secondary structures is rate-limiting for, and determines the frequency of mutations in vivo. In vitro analyses also verify the conclusion that intrinsically mutable bases are in fact located in ssDNA loops of predicted stem-loop structures (SLSs).",

     "abstract": "Helicases have important roles in nucleic acid metabolism, and their prominence is marked by the discovery of genetic disorders arising from disease-causing mutations. Missense mutations can yield unique insight to molecular functions and basis for disease pathology. XPB or XPD missense mutations lead to Xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne's syndrome, Trichothiodystrophy, or COFS syndrome, suggesting that DNA repair and transcription defects are responsible for clinical heterogeneity. Complex phenotypes are also observed for RECQL4 helicase mutations responsible for Rothmund\u2013Thomson syndrome, Baller\u2013Gerold syndrome, or RAPADILINO. Bloom's syndrome causing missense mutations are found in the conserved helicase and RecQ C-terminal domain of BLM that interfere with helicase function. Although rare, patient-derived missense mutations in the exonuclease or helicase domain of Werner syndrome protein exist. Characterization of WRN separation-of-function mutants may provide insight to catalytic requirements for suppression of phenotypes associated with the premature aging disorder. Characterized FANCJ missense mutations associated with breast cancer or Fanconi anemia interfere with FANCJ helicase activity required for DNA repair and the replication stress response. For example, a FA patient-derived mutation in the FANCJ Iron-Sulfur domain was shown to uncouple its ATPase and translocase activity from DNA unwinding. Mutations in DDX11 (ChlR1) are responsible for Warsaw Breakage syndrome, a recently discovered autosomal recessive cohesinopathy. Ongoing and future studies will address clinically relevant helicase mutations and polymorphisms, including those that interfere with key protein interactions or exert dominant negative phenotypes (e.g., certain mutant alleles of Twinkle mitochondrial DNA helicase). Chemical rescue may be an approach to restore helicase activity in loss-of-function helicase disorders.Genetic and biochemical analyses of disease-causing missense mutations in human helicase disorders have led to new insights to the molecular defects underlying aberrant cellular and clinical phenotypes.",

Long-term exposure to these insults places the aging eye at considerable risk for pathological consequences of oxidative stress. Furthermore, in eye tissues, mitochondria are an important endogenous source of ROS. Over time, all ocular structures, from the tear film to the retina, undergo oxidative stress, and therefore, the antioxidant defenses of each tissue assume the role of a safeguard against degenerative ocular pathologies. The ocular surface and cornea protect the other ocular tissues and are significantly exposed to oxidative stress of environmental origin. Overwhelming of antioxidant defenses in these tissues clinically manifests as pathologies including pterygium, corneal dystrophies, and endothelial Fuch's dystrophy. The crystalline lens is highly susceptible to oxidative damage in aging because its cells and their intracellular proteins are not turned over or replaced, thus providing the basis for cataractogenesis. The trabecular meshwork, which is the anterior chamber tissue devoted to aqueous humor drainage, has a particular susceptibility to mitochondrial oxidative injury that affects its endothelium and leads to an intraocular pressure increase that marks the beginning of glaucoma. Photo-oxidative stress can cause acute or chronic retinal damage. The pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration involves oxidative stress and death of the retinal pigment epithelium followed by death of the overlying photoreceptors. Accordingly, converging evidence indicates that mutagenic mechanisms of environmental and endogenous sources play a fundamental pathogenic role in degenerative eye diseases.",

     "abstract": "All living cells utilize intricate DNA repair mechanisms to address numerous types of DNA lesions and to preserve genomic integrity, and pluripotent stem cells have specific needs due to their remarkable ability of self-renewal and differentiation into different functional cell types. Not surprisingly, human stem cells possess a highly efficient DNA repair network that becomes less efficient upon differentiation. Moreover, these cells also have an anaerobic metabolism, which reduces the mitochondria number and the likelihood of oxidative stress, which is highly related to genomic instability. If DNA lesions are not repaired, human stem cells easily undergo senescence, cell death or differentiation, as part of their DNA damage response, avoiding the propagation of stem cells carrying mutations and genomic alterations. Interestingly, cancer stem cells and typical stem cells share not only the differentiation potential but also their capacity to respond to DNA damage, with important implications for cancer therapy using genotoxic agents. On the other hand, the preservation of the adult stem cell pool, and the ability of cells to deal with DNA damage, is essential for normal development, reducing processes of neurodegeneration and premature aging, as one can observe on clinical phenotypes of many human genetic diseases with defects in DNA repair processes. Finally, several recent findings suggest that DNA repair also plays a fundamental role in maintaining the pluripotency and differentiation potential of embryonic stem cells, as well as that of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. DNA repair processes also seem to be necessary for the reprogramming of human cells when iPS cells are produced. Thus, the understanding of how cultured pluripotent stem cells ensure the genetic stability are highly relevant for their safe therapeutic application, at the same time that cellular therapy is a hope for DNA repair deficient patients.",

     "abstract": "Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an uncommon malignant tumor arising from the calcitonin-producing parafollicular cells (C cells) of thyroid. It accounts for 5\u201310% of all thyroid cancers, and it mostly occurs as a sporadic entity (sMTC), but a familial pattern (fMTC) is also possible. RET proto-oncogene germline mutations are crucial for the onset and the progression of fMTC, and the occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms could predispose to the sporadic form. In order to clarify the role of this gene in MTC, we carefully reviewed the PubMed database using appropriate terms. First, we summarized current knowledge of the germline RET mutations, mutation spectrum, and prevalence. We then performed a meta-analysis on the available case-control association studies for sMTC. Finally, we carried out in silico predictions of the best associated variants in the attempt to better define their role in the disease. To date, a total of 39 different RET germline mutations have been identified in fMTC families. The most affected codons are 609, 611, 618, 620 (exon 10) and 634 (exon 11), encoding for the extracellular cysteine-rich domain, and codons 768 (exon 13) and 804 (exon 14) of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. Six polymorphisms with at least three studies were included in the meta-analysis (A45A [rs1800858], G691S [rs1799939], L769L [rs1800861], S836S [rs1800862], S904S [rs1800863], and IVS1-126G>T [rs2565206]). The meta-analysis demonstrated a modest association of sMTC susceptibility with S836S and a strong association with the IVS1-126G>T polymorphism. Besides RET polymorphisms, we also investigated the role of a few other low-penetrance alleles of genes involved in the RET pathway or in xenobiotic metabolism, but none of these were confirmed. Thus, despite the well-known molecular basis of fMTC, the genetic variants of the sporadic form are still poorly understood, and functional analyses are needed to better understand the consequence of such RET variants and to improve our knowledge on the disease.",

     "abstract": "To counteract the adverse effects of various DNA lesions, cells have evolved an array of diverse repair pathways to restore DNA structure and to coordinate repair with cell cycle regulation. Chromatin changes are an integral part of the DNA damage response, particularly with regard to the types of repair that involve assembly of large multiprotein complexes such as those involved in double strand break (DSB) repair and nucleotide excision repair (NER). A number of phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation and chromatin remodeling events modulate chromatin structure at the lesion site. These changes demarcate chromatin neighboring the lesion, afford accessibility and binding surfaces to repair factors and provide on-the-spot means to coordinate repair and damage signaling. Thus, the hierarchical assembly of repair factors at a double strand break is mostly due to their regulated interactions with posttranslational modifications of histones. A large number of chromatin remodelers are required at different stages of DSB repair and NER. Remodelers physically interact with proteins involved in repair processes, suggesting that chromatin remodeling is a requisite for repair factors to access the damaged site. Together, recent findings define the roles of histone post-translational modifications and chromatin remodeling in the DNA damage response and underscore possible differences in the requirements for these events in relation to the chromatin context.",

     "abstract": "Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is a complex disease that results from the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. Over the last 10 years there has been a great increase in association studies trying to identify the susceptibility genes for NIHL in humans. They were conducted based on the candidate gene approach and comprised predominantly the group of oxidative stress genes, inner ear potassium recycling pathway genes and monogenic deafness genes, as well as other genes. So far, the most promising results were obtained for two genes encoding potassium ion channels (KCNQ4 and KCNE1), catalase (CAT), protocadherin 15 (PCDH15), myosin 14 (MYH14) and heat shock protein (HSP70), because they were replicated in two (Polish and Swedish) or three (Polish, Swedish and Chinese) populations, and were sufficient in size to yield high power for the detection of a causative allele. Today, the development of high-throughput genotyping methods allows the detection of hundreds and thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a single array which undoubtedly will lead toward identification of new NIHL susceptibility genes. This in turn will contribute to the development of genetics tests that would allow for better protection of noise-exposed individuals and personalized treatment, if necessary.",

     "abstract": "The human genome is continuously exposed to such potentially deleterious agents as the highly reactive molecules known as reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS include superoxide anions (O2\u2212) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Over the last decade, the ROS-generating NADPH oxidases (NOXs) have been recognized as one of the main sources of ROS production in numerous human cell types. In addition to regulating normal physiological redox-dependent processes, the NOXs are involved in cellular oxidative stress. In contrast to the other NOXs, the NADPH oxidase NOX4 exists in the immediate environment of the nucleus. There is accumulating evidence for the involvement of NOX4-derived ROS in genomic instability as well as in cancer and other inflammation-related diseases. We recently showed that NOX4 plays a critical role in oncogenic Ras-induced DNA damage. Here we reflect upon the growing awareness of NOX4, review its role in inducing genomic instability, and call attention to its possible role in nuclear redox-sensitive mechanisms underlying DNA-damage signaling and repair.",

     "abstract": "Di(ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a manufactured chemical commonly added to plastics: it is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant to which humans are exposed through multiple routes. DEHP is a rodent carcinogen with an extensive data base on genotoxicity and related effects spanning several decades. Although DEHP has been reported to be negative in most non-mammalian in vitro mutation assays, most studies were performed under conditions of concurrent cytotoxicity, precipitation, or irrelevant metabolic activation. However, a number of in vitro rodent tissue assays have reported DEHP to be positive for effects on chromosomes, spindle, and mitosis. A robust database shows that DEHP increases transformation and inhibits apoptosis in Syrian hamster embryo cells. In a transgenic mouse assay, in vivo DEHP exposure increased the mutation frequency only in the liver, which is the target organ for cancer. In vitro exposure of human cells or tissues to DEHP induced DNA damage; altered mitotic rate, apoptosis, and cell proliferation; increased proliferation, tumor mobility, and invasiveness of tumor cell lines; and activated a number of nuclear receptors. DEHP has been shown to be an agonist for CAR2, a novel constitutive androstane receptor occurring only in humans. Environmental exposures of humans to DEHP have been associated with DNA damage. After taking into account study context and relevant issues affecting interpretation, in vitro studies reported that a similar DEHP concentration range induced both mutagenic and non-mutagenic effects in human tissues and, using a much more limited rodent database, transformation of embryonic rodent tissues. The human and rodent data suggest that DEHP induces cancer through multiple molecular signals, including DNA damage. The analyses presented here may provide guidance for similar data sets used in structure\u2013activity relationships, computational-toxicology extrapolations, and attempts to extrapolate in vitro results to predict in vivo effects for hazard characterization.",

     "abstract": "The faithful maintenance of chromosome continuity in human cells during DNA replication and repair is critical for preventing the conversion of normal diploid cells to an oncogenic state. The evolution of higher eukaryotic cells endowed them with a large genetic investment in the molecular machinery that ensures chromosome stability. In mammalian and other vertebrate cells, the elimination of double-strand breaks with minimal nucleotide sequence change involves the spatiotemporal orchestration of a seemingly endless number of proteins ranging in their action from the nucleotide level to nucleosome organization and chromosome architecture. DNA DSBs trigger a myriad of post-translational modifications that alter catalytic activities and the specificity of protein interactions: phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation, ubiquitylation, and SUMOylation, followed by the reversal of these changes as repair is completed. \u201cSuperfluous\u201d protein recruitment to damage sites, functional redundancy, and alternative pathways ensure that DSB repair is extremely efficient, both quantitatively and qualitatively. This review strives to integrate the information about the molecular mechanisms of DSB repair that has emerged over the last two decades with a focus on DSBs produced by the prototype agent ionizing radiation (IR). The exponential growth of molecular studies, heavily driven by RNA knockdown technology, now reveals an outline of how many key protein players in genome stability and cancer biology perform their interwoven tasks, e.g. ATM, ATR, DNA-PK, Chk1, Chk2, PARP1/2/3, 53BP1, BRCA1, BRCA2, BLM, RAD51, and the MRE11\u2013RAD50\u2013NBS1 complex. Thus, the nature of the intricate coordination of repair processes with cell cycle progression is becoming apparent. This review also links molecular abnormalities to cellular pathology as much a possible and provides a framework of temporal relationships.",

     "abstract": "Programmed cell death and DNA repair are two fundamental biological processes that play essential roles in cell fate and genetic transmission. The canonical role of Bcl-2 family members is the regulation of programmed cell death. Strikingly, numerous studies from different laboratories have shown that although Bcl-2 increases cell survival, it also inhibits all DNA repair systems, resulting in genome instability/variability. Bcl-2 affects the mechanistically distinct DNA repair systems via different mechanisms. These effects are generally independent of the regulation of apoptosis, revealing additional roles for Bcl-2. The targets of Bcl-2 include APE1, MSH2, PARP1, Ku70 and the oncosuppressor BRCA1. Targetting BRCA1 should be of particular importance because this might impact many essential cellular processes in which BRCA1 is involved, including homologous recombination (HR), non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), base excision repair, cell-cycle regulation, cell death, ubiquitination, inactivation of the X-chromosome, transcription, and protein translation. Beside the pathological consequences, inhibition of DNA repair by Bcl-2 can be, in contrast, advantageously used in some physiological situations: (1) repression of excessive unschedule HR, thus protecting against the accumulation of toxic HR intermediates and HR-dependent genome rearrangements; (2) inhibition of NHEJ might protect against retrovirus integration; (3) it has been proposed that inhibition of mismatch repair might also favors hypermutation at immunoglobulin genes. Finally, because Bcl-2 affects the maintenance of genome stability, one can suggest Bcl-2 might play a role in molecular evolution. Bcl-2 family members control cell death through complex stochiometric equilibriums. Incorporating DNA repair proteins to such an elaborate network should allow for a fine tuning of the coordinated control of cell viability and genetic stability/instability. Relationships between DNA repair and regulation of cell death represent exciting challenges for future prospects and are essential for the development of promising new strategies against cancer.",

     "abstract": "Ionizing radiation is a known human carcinogen that can induce a variety of biological effects depending on the physical nature, duration, doses and dose-rates of exposure. However, the magnitude of health risks at low doses and dose-rates (below 100\u00a0mSv and/or 0.1\u00a0mSv\u00a0min\u22121) remains controversial due to a lack of direct human evidence. It is anticipated that significant insights will emerge from the integration of epidemiological and biological research, made possible by molecular epidemiology studies incorporating biomarkers and bioassays. A number of these have been used to investigate exposure, effects and susceptibility to ionizing radiation, albeit often at higher doses and dose rates, with each reflecting time-limited cellular or physiological alterations. This review summarises the multidisciplinary work undertaken in the framework of the European project DoReMi (Low Dose Research towards Multidisciplinary Integration) to identify the most appropriate biomarkers for use in population studies. In addition to logistical and ethical considerations for conducting large-scale epidemiological studies, we discuss the relevance of their use for assessing the effects of low dose ionizing radiation exposure at the cellular and physiological level. We also propose a temporal classification of biomarkers that may be relevant for molecular epidemiology studies which need to take into account the time elapsed since exposure. Finally, the integration of biology with epidemiology requires careful planning and enhanced discussions between the epidemiology, biology and dosimetry communities in order to determine the most important questions to be addressed in light of pragmatic considerations including the appropriate population to be investigated (occupationally, environmentally or medically exposed), and study design. The consideration of the logistics of biological sample collection, processing and storing and the choice of biomarker or bioassay, as well as awareness of potential confounding factors, are also essential.",

     "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in many biological processes, cancer, and other diseases. In addition, miRNAs are dysregulated following exposure to toxic and genotoxic agents. Here we review studies evaluating modulation of miRNAs by dietary and pharmacological agents, which could potentially be exploited for inhibition of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis. This review covers natural agents, including vitamins, oligoelements, polyphenols, isoflavones, indoles, isothiocyanates, phospholipids, saponins, anthraquinones and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and synthetic agents, including thiols, nuclear receptor agonists, histone deacetylase inhibitors, antiinflammatory drugs, and selective estrogen receptor modulators. As many as 145 miRNAs, involved in the control of a variety of carcinogenesis mechanisms, were modulated by these agents, either individually or in combination. Most studies used cancer cells in vitro with the goal of modifying their phenotype by changing miRNA expression profiles. In vivo studies evaluated regulation of miRNAs by chemopreventive agents in organs of mice and rats, either untreated or exposed to carcinogens, with the objective of evaluating their safety and efficacy. The tissue specificity of miRNAs could be exploited for the chemoprevention of site-specific cancers, and the study of polymorphic miRNAs is expected to predict the individual response to chemopreventive agents as a tool for developing new prevention strategies.",

     "abstract": "Alterations of genetic and epigenetic features can provide important insights into the natural history of breast cancer. Although DNA methylation analysis is a rapidly developing field, a reproducible epigenetic blood-based assay for diagnosis and follow-up of breast cancer has yet to be successfully developed into a routine clinical test. The aim of this study was to review multiple serum DNA methylation assays and to highlight the value of those novel biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis and prediction of therapeutic outcome. Serum is readily accessible for molecular diagnosis in all individuals from a peripheral blood sample. The list of hypermethylated genes in breast cancer is heterogeneous and no single gene is methylated in all breast cancer types. There is increasing evidence that a panel of epigenetic markers is essential to achieve a higher sensitivity and specificity in breast cancer detection. However, the reported percentages of methylation are highly variable, which can be partly explained by the different sensitivities and the different intra-/inter-assay coefficients of variability of the analysis methods. Moreover, there is a striking lack of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the proposed biomarkers. Another point of criticism is the fact that \u2018normal\u2019 patterns of DNA methylation of some tumor suppressor and other cancer-related genes are influenced by several factors and are often poorly characterized. A relatively frequent methylation of those genes has been observed in high-risk asymptomatic women. Finally, there is a call for larger prospective cohort studies to determine methylation patterns during treatment and follow-up. Identification of patterns specific for a differential response to therapeutic interventions should be useful. Only in this way, it will be possible to evaluate the predictive and prognostic characteristics of those novel promising biomarkers.",

     "abstract": "In the current survey, we summarize the published literature which supports the use of melatonin, an endogenously produced molecule, as a protective agent against chronic, low-level ionizing radiation. Under in vitro conditions, melatonin uniformly was found to protect cellular DNA and plasmid super coiled DNA from ionizing radiation damage due to Cs137 or X-radiation exposure. Likewise, in an in vivo/in vitro study in which humans were given melatonin orally and then their blood lymphocytes were collected and exposed to Cs137 ionizing radiation, nuclear DNA from the cells of those individuals who consumed melatonin (and had elevated blood levels) was less damaged than that from control individuals. In in vivo studies as well, melatonin given to animals prevented DNA and lipid damage (including limiting membrane rigidity) and reduced the percentage of animals that died when they had been exposed to Cs137 or Co60 radiation. Melatonin's ability to protect macromolecules from the damage inflicted by ionizing radiation likely stems from its high efficacy as a direct free radical scavenger and possibly also due to its ability to stimulate antioxidative enzymes. Melatonin is readily absorbed when taken orally or via any other route. Melatonin's ease of self administration and its virtual absence of toxicity or side effects, even when consumed over very long periods of time, are essential when large populations are exposed to lingering radioactive contamination such as occurs as a result of an inadvertent nuclear accident, an intentional nuclear explosion or the detonation of a radiological dispersion device, i.e., a \u201cdirty\u201d bomb.",

At excessive amounts, 1O2 induces oxidative stress and shows carcinogenic and toxic effects due to oxidation of lipids, proteins and nucleic acids. Singlet oxygen is able to react with DNA molecule and may induce G to T transversions due to 8-oxodG generation. The nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair and mismatch repair have been implicated in the correction of DNA lesions induced by 1O2 both in prokaryotic and in eukaryotic cells. 1O2 is also able to induce the expression of genes involved with the cellular responses to oxidative stress, such as NF-\u03baB, c-fos and c-jun, and genes involved with tissue damage and inflammation, as ICAM-1, interleukins 1 and 6. The studies outlined in this review reinforce the idea that 1O2 is one of the more dangerous reactive oxygen species to the cells, and deserves our attention.",

     "abstract": "The interplay between ATM and DNA-PKcs kinases during double strand breaks (DSBs) resolution is still a matter of debate. ATM and DNA-PKcs participate differently in the DNA damage response pathway (DDR), but important common aspects are indeed found: both of them are activated when faced with DSBs, they share common targets in the DDR and the absence of either kinase results in faulty DSB repair. Absence of ATM translates into timely repair that, nevertheless, is incomplete. On the other hand, DNA-PKcs absence translates into slower repair, which in turn gives rise to the accumulation of simple and complex reorganizations. These outcomes confirm that the function of both protein kinases is essential to guarantee genome integrity. Interestingly, V(D)J and CSR recombination events provide a powerful tool to study the interplay between both kinases in DSB repair. Although the physiological DSBs generated during V(D)J and CSR recombination are resolved by the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair pathway, ATM absence during these events translates into chromosome translocations. These results suggest that NHEJ accuracy is threatened in the absence of ATM, which may play a role in avoiding illegitimate repair by favouring the joining of the correct DNA ends. Indeed, simultaneous DNA-PKcs and ATM deficiency during V(D)J and CSR recombination translates into a synergistic increase in potentially dangerous chromosomal translocations and deletions. Although the exact nature of their interaction remains elusive, the evidence indicates that ATM and DNA-PKcs play complementary roles that allow complete and legitimate DSB repair to be reached. Faithful repair can only be achieved by the presence and correct functioning of both kinases: while DNA-PKcs ensures fast rejoining, ATM guarantees complete repair.",

Individual therapy responses vary considerably from spontaneous clearing of the virus to lethal conditions. Host genetics currently receives a major scientific and clinical interest as an important source of interindividual variability in treatment. Mainly the associations of interleukin 28B gene (IL28B) variants with decreased HCV clearance under standard therapy are considered as \u201cstate of the art\u201d of hepatitis C pharmacogenetics. However, a search in PubMed identified 41 genes reportedly modulating the individual therapy response, e.g., genes coding for major histocompatibility complex (HLA), the tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 10 (IL10), other interferon coding genes than IL28B (e.g., IFNAR1, IFNAR2, IFNG), several components of downstream interferon signaling as well as genes modulating side effects of current anti-HCV therapeutics (e.g., SLC28A3, ITPA involved in ribavirin associated hemolytic effects or SLC6A4 and HTR1A involved in serotonin associated psychiatric side effects). Applying knowledge discovery methods from the area of data mining and machine-learning to this comprehensive set of HCV therapy modulating genes, relating the HCV genes to the world wide knowledge on genes given in the form of the Gene Ontology (GO) knowledge base, found that the relevant genes belong to the GO subcategories of \u201cinflammatory response\u201d and \u201cimmune response\u201d and \u201cresponse to virus\u201d.

Although various approaches are employed for making mode of action decisions, a systematic investigation to identify the major factors that influence these determinations has not been performed. To accomplish this, over 40 chemical risk assessments conducted by U.S. or international regulatory agencies and organizations were reviewed to identify components that had played a significant role, either directly or indirectly, in the decision-making process. The major factors identified included the chemical properties of the agent, its metabolites and degradation products; its metabolism and toxicokinetics; genotoxic effects seen in vivo, particularly in the target organ; structural or metabolic similarities to known mutagenic or nonmutagenic chemicals; characteristics of the tumors induced in the animal bioassays; and the origin of the observed effects. The quality of the data, the specific genotoxic endpoint and its sensitivity to assay conditions and toxicity were also important considerations. In all cases, the authoritative groups used a weight-of-evidence approach and, in most cases where evaluations were conducted by more than one authoritative body, similar conclusions were reached. In summary, a critical evaluation of the data as well as expert judgment is necessary in reaching mechanism of action conclusions. These determinations should be made within the broader context of evaluating the chemical's overall toxicity and carcinogenicity.",

These micronutrients have been implicated in colorectal cancer risk. There are, however, inconsistencies within the literature, with some studies showing restriction to have tumour-inhibitory effects, whereas others suggest excess to have adverse outcomes. We conducted a review of the published data to examine the accumulated evidence for involvement of dietary folate and/or methionine restriction or excess in intestinal tumour development in the ApcMin/+ mouse model, which is genetically prone to develop such cancers. Thirteen publications were selected for evaluation based on the following inclusion criteria: (i) use of ApcMin/+ mouse model; (ii) interventions using dietary folate and/or methionine; and (iii) primary outcome measures focused on intestinal tumour development. We found that nutritional modulation of folate and methionine was shown to have different effects on intestinal cancer in the ApcMin/+ mouse, depending on the dosage, duration and timing of intervention, and interaction of the ApcMin/+ genotype with other genetic factors affecting folate and DNA methylation metabolism. Although some studies showed that folate deficiency before tumorigenesis tended to increase risk of tumour formation, there are inconsistencies regarding whether excess folate post-weaning or after tumour initiation increases intestinal tumour burden. Altogether, the pooled data do not appear to indicate a difference in effect on intestinal tumour incidence between post-weaning diets that are folate deficient or folate adequate. The ApcMin/+ mouse is a useful model for assessment of the impact of dietary folate on intestinal tumour development, but further research is required to understand the reasons for these inconsistencies amongst studies based on likely mechanisms, including modulation of nucleotide synthesis, DNA methylation, and chromosomal instability, which may affect the rate of cellular division and its control.",

     "abstract": "Factors affecting the type and frequency of germline mutations in animals are of significant interest from health and toxicology perspectives. However, studies in this field have been limited by the use of markers with low detection power or uncertain relevance to phenotype. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is now a potential option to directly determine germline mutation type and frequency in family groups at all loci simultaneously. Medical studies have already capitalized on WGS to identify novel mutations in human families for clinical purposes, such as identifying candidate genes contributing to inherited conditions. However, WGS has not yet been used in any studies of vertebrates that aim to quantify changes in germline mutation frequency as a result of environmental factors. WGS is a promising tool for detecting mutation induction, but it is currently limited by several technical challenges. Perhaps the most pressing issue is sequencing error rates that are currently high in comparison to the intergenerational mutation frequency. Different platforms and depths of coverage currently result in a range of 10\u2013103 false positives for every true mutation. In addition, the cost of WGS is still relatively high, particularly when comparing mutation frequencies among treatment groups with even moderate sample sizes. Despite these challenges, WGS offers the potential for unprecedented insight into germline mutation processes. Refinement of available tools and emergence of new technologies may be able to provide the improved accuracy and reduced costs necessary to make WGS viable in germline mutation studies in the very near future. To streamline studies, researchers may use multiple family triads per treatment group and sequence a targeted (reduced) portion of each genome with high (20\u201340\u00d7) depth of coverage. We are optimistic about the application of WGS for quantifying germline mutations, but caution researchers regarding the resource-intensive nature of the work using existing technology.",

     "publication date": "06-2012",
     "abstract": "Isothiocyanates, occurring in many dietary cruciferous vegetables, show interesting chemopreventive activities against several chronic\u2013degenerative diseases, including cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegeneration, diabetes. The electrophilic carbon residue in the isothiocyanate moiety reacts with biological nucleophiles and modification of proteins is recognized as a key mechanism underlying the biological activity of isothiocyanates. The nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 system, which orchestrates the expression of a wide array of antioxidant genes, plays a role in the protective effect of isothiocyanates against almost all the pathological conditions reported above. Recent emerging findings suggest a further common mechanism. Chronic inflammation plays a central role in many human diseases and isothiocyanates inhibit the activity of many inflammation components, suppress cyclooxygenase 2, and irreversibly inactivate the macrophage migration inhibitory factor. Due to their electrophilic reactivity, some isothiocyanates are able to form adducts with DNA and induce gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations. DNA damage has been demonstrated to be involved in the pathogenesis of various chronic\u2013degenerative diseases of epidemiological relevance. Thus, the genotoxicity of the isothiocyanates should be carefully considered. In addition, the dose\u2013response relationship for genotoxic compounds does not suggest evidence of a threshold. Thus, chemicals that are genotoxic pose a greater potential risk to humans than non-genotoxic compounds. Dietary consumption levels of isothiocyanates appear to be several orders of magnitude lower than the doses used in the genotoxicity studies and thus it is highly unlikely that such toxicities would occur in humans. However, the beneficial properties of isothiocyanates stimulated an increase of dietary supplements and functional foods with highly enriched isothiocyanate concentrations on the market. Whether such concentrations may exert a potential health risk cannot be excluded with certainty and an accurate evaluation of the toxicological profile of isothiocyanates should be prompted before any major increase in their consumption be recommended or their clinical use suggested.",

     "abstract": "Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), a cancer of the serosal pleural cavities, is one of the most aggressive human tumors. In order to identify genes crucial for the onset and progression of MPM, we performed an extensive literature review focused on transcriptome studies (RTS). In this kind of studies a great number of transcripts are analyzed without formulating any a priori hypothesis, thus preventing any bias coming from previously established knowledge that could lead to an over-representation of specific genes.Each study was thoroughly analyzed paying particular attention to: (i) the employed microarray platform, (ii) the number and type of samples, (iii) the fold-change, and (iv) the statistical significance of deregulated genes. We also performed data mining (DM) on MPM using three different tools (Coremine, SNPs3D, and GeneProspector). Results from RTS and DM were compared in order to restrict the number of genes potentially deregulated in MPM. Our main requirement for a gene to be a \u201cmesothelioma gene\u201d (MG) is to be reproducibly deregulated among independent studies and confirmed by DM. A list of MGs was thus produced, including PTGS2, BIRC5, ASS1, JUNB, MCM2, AURKA, FGF2, MKI67, CAV1, SFRP1, CCNB1, CDK4, and MSLN that might represent potential novel biomarkers or therapeutic targets for MPM. Moreover, it was found a sub-group of MGs including ASS1, JUNB, PTGS2, EEF2, SULF1, TOP2A, AURKA, BIRC5, CAV1, IFITM1, PCNA, and PKM2 that could explain, at least in part, the mechanisms of resistance to cisplatin, one first-line chemotherapeutic drug used for the disease. Finally, the pathway analysis showed that co-regulation networks related to the cross-talk between MPM and its micro-environment, in particular involving the adhesion molecules, integrins, and cytokines, might have an important role in MPM. Future studies are warranted to better characterize the role played by these genes in MPM.",

     "abstract": "Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a peroxisome proliferator agent that is widely used as a plasticizer to soften polyvinylchloride plastics and non-polymers. Both occupational (e.g., by inhalation during its manufacture and use as a plasticizer of polyvinylchloride) and environmental (medical devices, contamination of food, or intake from air, water and soil) routes of exposure to DEHP are of concern for human health. There is sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity of DEHP in the liver in both rats and mice; however, there is little epidemiological evidence on possible associations between exposure to DEHP and liver cancer in humans. Data are available to suggest that liver is not the only target tissue for DEHP-associated toxicity and carcinogenicity in both humans and rodents. The debate regarding human relevance of the findings in rats or mice has been informed by studies on the mechanisms of carcinogenesis of the peroxisome proliferator class of chemicals, including DEHP. Important additional mechanistic information became available in the past decade, including, but not limited to, sub-acute, sub-chronic and chronic studies with DEHP in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b1-null mice, as well as experiments utilizing several transgenic mouse lines. Activation of PPAR\u03b1 and the subsequent downstream events mediated by this transcription factor represent an important mechanism of action for DEHP in rats and mice. However, additional data from animal models and studies in humans exposed to DEHP from the environment suggest that multiple molecular signals and pathways in several cell types in the liver, rather than a single molecular event, contribute to the cancer in rats and mice. In addition, the toxic and carcinogenic effects of DEHP are not limited to liver. The International Agency for Research on Cancer working group concluded that the human relevance of the molecular events leading to cancer elicited by DEHP in several target tissues (e.g., liver and testis) in rats and mice can not be ruled out and DEHP was classified as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).",

     "abstract": "Clustered mutations may be broadly defined as the presence of two or more mutations within a spatially localized genomic region on a single chromosome. Known instances vary in terms of both the number and type of the component mutations, ranging from two closely spaced point mutations to tens or even hundreds of genomic rearrangements. Although clustered mutations can represent the observable net result of independent lesions sequentially acquired over multiple cell cycles, they can also be generated in a simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous manner within a single cell cycle. This review focuses on those mechanisms known to underlie the latter type. Both gene conversion and transient hypermutability are capable of generating closely spaced multiple mutations. However, a recently described phenomenon in human cancer cells, known as \u2018chromothripsis\u2019, has provided convincing evidence that tens to hundreds of genomic rearrangements can sometimes be generated simultaneously via a single catastrophic event. The distinctive genomic features observed in the derivative chromosomes, together with the highly characteristic junction sequences, point to non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) as being the likely underlying mutational mechanism. By contrast, replication-based mechanisms such as microhomology-mediated break-induced replication (MMBIR) which involves serial replication slippage or serial template switching probably account for those complex genomic rearrangements that comprise multiple duplications and/or triplications.",

     "abstract": "Resveratrol (3,4\u2032,5-trans-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring stilbene, is considered to have a number of beneficial effects, including anticancer, anti-aethrogenic, anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and estrogenic activity. Piceatannol (3,3\u2032,4,5\u2032-trans-trihydroxystilbene), a naturally occurring hydroxylated analogue of resveratrol, is less studied than resveratrol but displays a wide spectrum of biological activity. Piceatannol has been found in various plants, including grapes, passion fruit, white tea, and Japanese knotweed. Besides antioxidative effects, piceatannol exhibits potential anticancer properties as suggested by its ability to suppress proliferation of a wide variety of tumor cells, including leukemia, lymphoma; cancers of the breast, prostate, colon and melanoma. The growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of piceatannol are mediated through cell-cycle arrest; upregulation of Bid, Bax, Bik, Bok, Fas; P21WAF1 down-regulation of Bcl-xL; BCL-2, cIAP, activation of caspases (-3, -7, -8, -9), loss of mitochondrial potential, and release of cytochrome c. Piceatannol has been shown to suppress the activation of some transcription factors, including NF-\u03baB, which plays a central role as a transcriptional regulator in response to cellular stress caused by free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, cytokines, or microbial antigens. Piceatannol also inhibits JAK-1, which is a key member of the STAT pathway that is crucial in controlling cellular activities in response to extracellular cytokines and is a COX-2-inducible enzyme involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis. Although piceatannol has been shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells, there are examples of its anti-apoptotic pro-proliferative activity. Piceatannol inhibits Syk kinase, which plays a crucial role in the coordination of immune recognition receptors and orchestrates multiple downstream signaling pathways in various hematopoietic cells. Piceatannol also binds estrogen receptors and stimulates growth of estrogen-dependent cancer cells. Piceatannol is rapidly metabolized in the liver and is converted mainly to a glucuronide conjugate; however, sulfation is also possible, based on in vitro studies. The pharmacological properties of piceatannol, especially its antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities, suggests that piceatannol might be a potentially useful nutritional and pharmacological biomolecule; however, more data are needed on its bioavailability and toxicity in humans.",

Reducing protocol variability, assessing the role of confounders, and estimating a range of reference values are research priorities that will be addressed by the HUMNXL collaborative study. The HUMNXL project evaluates the impact of host factors, occupation, life-style, disease status, and protocol features on the occurrence of MN in exfoliated buccal cells. In addition, the study will provide a range of reference values for all cytome endpoints. A database of 5424 subjects with buccal MN values obtained from 30 laboratories worldwide was compiled and analyzed to investigate the influence of several conditions affecting MN frequency. Random effects models were mostly used to investigate MN predictors. The estimated spontaneous MN frequency was 0.74\u2030 (95% CI 0.52\u20131.05). Only staining among technical features influenced MN frequency, with an abnormal increase for non-DNA-specific stains. No effect of gender was evident, while the trend for age was highly significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Most occupational exposures and a diagnosis of cancer significantly increased MN and other endpoints frequencies. MN frequency increased in heavy smoking (\u226540\u00a0cig/day, FR\u00a0=\u00a01.37; 95% CI 1.03\u2013.82) and decreased with daily fruit consumption (FR\u00a0=\u00a00.68; 95% CI 0.50\u20130.91). The results of the HUMNXL project identified priorities for validation studies, increased the basic knowledge of the assay, and contributed to the creation of a laboratory network which in perspective may allow the evaluation of disease risk associated with MN frequency.",

     "abstract": "Activities and quantities of several oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system complexes are decreased in many Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Mutations in PD-associated nuclear genes affect OXPHOS function. Moreover, the inactivation of other nuclear genes related to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) replication and expression also leads to Parkinsonism. MtDNA only encodes OXPHOS subunits and the RNAs required for their expression. Mutations in mtDNA genes have also been associated with PD. Furthermore, many xenobiotics that inhibit different OXPHOS complexes provoke Parkinsonism. The binding sites for these venoms are usually mtDNA-encoded subunits. However, and despite the existence of mutations or toxicants that can cause Parkinsonism, PD only rarely results from isolated genetic or environmental factors.Combinations of nuclear and mitochondrial genetic and environmental factors have additive effects and increase the risk of PD. It is also possible that population polymorphisms in mtDNA genes, affecting interactions with different xenobiotics, may behave as susceptibility factors for developing PD only in the presence of that particular xenobiotic. Therefore, a deeper analysis of the OXPHOS function in PD is required if we want to unravel the complexities of this disorder.",

     "abstract": "The accumulation of DNA damage is a slow but hazardous phenomenon that may lead to cell death, accelerated aging features and cancer. One of the most versatile and important defense mechanisms against the accumulation of DNA damage is nucleotide excision repair (NER), in which the Xeroderma pigmentosum group C (XPC) protein plays a prominent role. NER can be divided into global genome repair (GG-NER) and transcription coupled repair (TC-NER). XPC is a key factor in GG-NER where it functions in DNA damage recognition and after which the repair machinery is recruited to eliminate the DNA damage. Defective XPC functioning has been shown to result in a cancer prone phenotype, in human as well as in mice. Mutation accumulation in XPC deficient mice is accelerated and increased, resulting in an increased tumor incidence. More recently XPC has also been linked to functions outside of NER since XPC deficient mice show a divergent tumor spectrum compared to other NER deficient mouse models. Multiple in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that XPC appears to be involved in the initiation of several DNA damage-induced cellular responses. XPC seems to function in the removal of oxidative DNA damage, redox homeostasis and cell cycle control. We hypothesize that this combination of increased oxidative DNA damage sensitivity, disturbed redox homeostasis together with inefficient cell cycle control mechanisms are causes of the observed increased cancer susceptibility in oxygen exposed tissues. Such a phenotype is absent in other NER-deficient mice, including Xpa.",

     "abstract": "Formaldehyde, the recently classified carcinogen and ubiquitous environmental contaminant, has long been suspected of causing adverse reproductive and developmental effects, but previous reviews were inconclusive, due in part, to limitations in the design of many of the human population studies. In the current review, we systematically evaluated evidence of an association between formaldehyde exposure and adverse reproductive and developmental effects, in human populations and in vivo animal studies, in the peer-reviewed literature. The mostly retrospective human studies provided evidence of an association of maternal exposure with adverse reproductive and developmental effects. Further assessment of this association by meta-analysis revealed an increased risk of spontaneous abortion (1.76, 95% CI 1.20\u20132.59, p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and of all adverse pregnancy outcomes combined (1.54, 95% CI 1.27\u20131.88, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), in formaldehyde-exposed women, although differential recall, selection bias, or confounding cannot be ruled out. Evaluation of the animal studies including all routes of exposure, doses and dosing regimens studied, suggested positive associations between formaldehyde exposure and reproductive toxicity, mostly in males. Potential mechanisms underlying formaldehyde-induced reproductive and developmental toxicities, including chromosome and DNA damage (genotoxicity), oxidative stress, altered level and/or function of enzymes, hormones and proteins, apoptosis, toxicogenomic and epigenomic effects (such as DNA methylation), were identified. To clarify these associations, well-designed molecular epidemiologic studies, that include quantitative exposure assessment and diminish confounding factors, should examine both reproductive and developmental outcomes associated with exposure in males and females. Together with mechanistic and animal studies, this will allow us to better understand the systemic effect of formaldehyde exposure.",

     "abstract": "Ionizing radiation (IR)-induced cellular damage is implicated in carcinogenesis as well as therapy of cancer. Advances in radiation therapy have led to the decrease in dosage and localizing the effects to the tumor; however, the development of radioresistance in cancer cells and radiation toxicity to normal tissues are still the major concerns. The development of radioresistance involves several mechanisms, including the activation of mitogenic and survival signaling, induction of DNA repair, and changes in redox signaling and epigenetic regulation. The current strategy of combining radiation with standard cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents can potentially lead to unwanted side effects due to both agents. Thus agents are needed that could improve the efficacy of radiation killing of cancer cells and prevent the damage to normal cells and tissues caused by the direct and bystander effects of radiation, without have its own systemic toxicity. Chemopreventive phytochemicals, usually non-toxic agents with both cancer preventive and therapeutic activities, could rightly fit in this approach. In this regard, naturally occurring compounds, including curcumin, parthenolide, genistein, gossypol, ellagic acid, withaferin, plumbagin and resveratrol, have shown considerable potential. These agents suppress the radiation-induced activation of receptor tyrosine kinases and nuclear factor-\u03baB signaling, can modify cell survival and DNA repair efficacy, and may potentiate ceramide signaling. These radiosensitizing and counter radioresistance mechanisms of phytochemicals in cancer cells are also associated with changes in epigenetic gene regulation. Because radioresistance involves multiple mechanisms, more studies are needed to discover novel phytochemicals having multiple mechanisms of radiosensitization and to overcome radioresistance of cancer cells. Pre-clinical studies are needed to address the appropriate dosage, timing, and duration of the application of phytochemicals with radiation to justify clinical trials. Nonetheless, some phytochemicals in combination with IR may play a significant role in enhancing the therapeutic index of cancer treatment.",

Successful results in vivo have been obtained from invertebrate animal models, whereas vertebrate systems have been limited primarily to mammalian models and cell lines. Nevertheless, exciting results have also been reported from non-mammalian vertebrate models, such as the knock-down of endogenous genes in Xenopus tadpoles by a construct containing both a Xenopus-specific shRNA sequence and the human Ago2 (which is a key enzyme in the RNAi silencing complex), or the design of a novel vector expressing a miRNA driven by a tissue-specific promoter in zebrafish, and the use of an avian retroviral vector to deliver miRNA and shRNA in chicken embryos proving to be effective in knocking-down endogenous genes with a long lasting effect, to mention some examples. Whether dsRNA is able to initiate a specific RNAi response, or all the factors required for RNAi are present in non-mammalian vertebrates, are still questions which remain to be answered. Further progress in understanding natural RNAi mechanisms in non-mammalian vertebrates will help scientists to overcome difficulties and improve this gene silencing technology.

     "abstract": "Given the central role of DNA in life, and how ageing can be seen as the gradual and irreversible breakdown of living systems, the idea that damage to the DNA is the crucial cause of ageing remains a powerful one. DNA damage and mutations of different types clearly accumulate with age in mammalian tissues. Human progeroid syndromes resulting in what appears to be accelerated ageing have been linked to defects in DNA repair or processing, suggesting that elevated levels of DNA damage can accelerate physiological decline and the development of age-related diseases not limited to cancer. Higher DNA damage may trigger cellular signalling pathways, such as apoptosis, that result in a faster depletion of stem cells, which in turn contributes to accelerated ageing. Genetic manipulations of DNA repair pathways in mice further strengthen this view and also indicate that disruption of specific pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair and non-homologous end joining, is more strongly associated with premature ageing phenotypes. Delaying ageing in mice by decreasing levels of DNA damage, however, has not been achieved yet, perhaps due to the complexity inherent to DNA repair and DNA damage response pathways. Another open question is whether DNA repair optimization is involved in the evolution of species longevity, and we suggest that the way cells from different organisms respond to DNA damage may be crucial in species differences in ageing. Taken together, the data suggest a major role of DNA damage in the modulation of longevity, possibly through effects on cell dysfunction and loss, although understanding how to modify DNA damage repair and response systems to delay ageing remains a crucial challenge.",

     "abstract": "Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer mortality. The metastatic cascade represents a multi-step process which includes local tumor cell invasion, entry into the vasculature followed by the exit of carcinoma cells from the circulation and colonization at the distal sites. At the earliest stage of successful cancer cell dissemination, the primary cancer adapts the secondary site of tumor colonization involving the tumor\u2013stroma crosstalk. The migration and plasticity of cancer cells as well as the surrounding environment such as stromal and endothelial cells are mandatory. Consequently, the mechanisms of cell movement are of utmost relevance for targeted intervention of which three different types have been reported. Tumor cells can migrate either collectively, in a mesenchymal or in an amoeboid type of movement and intravasate the blood or lymph vasculature. Intravasation by the interaction of tumor cells with the vascular endothelium is mechanistically poorly understood. Changes in the epithelial plasticity enable carcinoma cells to switch between these types of motility. The types of migration may change depending on the intervention thereby increasing the velocity and aggressiveness of invading cancer cells. Interference with collective or mesenchymal cell invasion by targeting integrin expression or metalloproteinase activity, respectively, resulted in an amoeboid cell phenotype as the ultimate exit strategy of cancer cells. There are little mechanistic details reported in vivo showing that the amoeboid behavior can be either reversed or efficiently inhibited. Future concepts of metastasis intervention must simultaneously address the collective, mesenchymal and amoeboid mechanisms of cell invasion in order to advance in anti-metastatic strategies as these different types of movement can coexist and cooperate. Beyond the targeting of cell movements, the adhesion of cancer cells to the stroma in heterotypic circulating tumor cell emboli is of paramount relevance for anti-metastatic therapy.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to genotoxic chemicals during in utero development may lead to outcomes such as altered gene transcription, mutations, or cell death. Ultimately, such exposures may result in cancer, malformations, or functional deficits. As a mechanism that can limit the impact of genotoxicants in adults, DNA repair may also be an important factor that determines the outcome of the conceptus. This review of the literature examines the current understanding of DNA repair during in utero mammalian development by investigating the importance of maintaining genomic integrity and factors affecting susceptibility, including DNA repair. Most data have been derived from studies in rodent models focusing on DNA repair gene expression, which can vary according to developmental stages, tissues, and DNA repair pathways. Gene expression information is limited for humans but is suggestive that the major repair pathways exist during in utero development. Due to the complexities of DNA repair and its regulation by other pathways, available gene expression data may be limited for clarifying the role of DNA repair as a mechanism controlling the response to in utero exposures to genotoxicants. While not a comprehensive dataset, functional studies assessing in utero DNA repair capacity do demonstrate the variable ability of fetal tissue to remove DNA damage. Data gaps are recognized and recommendations for additional research using stems cells and traditional embryo models are identified. Finally, a brief discussion focuses on how data regarding in utero DNA repair may ultimately be utilized in health risk assessments of genotoxic chemicals.",

Among many compounds, 3,3\u2032-diindolylmethane (DIM) is generated in the acidic environment of the stomach following dimerization of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) monomers present in these classes of vegetables. Both I3C and DIM have been investigated for their use in preventing, inhibiting, and reversing the progression of cancer \u2013 as a chemopreventive agent. In this review, we summarize an updated, wide-ranging pleiotropic anti-tumor and biological effects elicited by DIM against tumor cells. It is unfeasible to point one single target as basis of cellular target of action of DIM. We emphasize key cellular and molecular events that are effectively modulated in the direction of inducing apoptosis and suppressing cell proliferation. Collectively, DIM orchestrates signaling through Ah receptor, NF-\u03baB/Wnt/Akt/mTOR pathways impinging on cell cycle arrest, modulation of key cytochrome P450 enzymes, altering angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and epigenetic behavior of cancer cells. The ability of DIM to selectively induce tumor cells to undergo apoptosis has been observed in preclinical models, and thus it has been speculated in improving the therapeutic efficacy of other anticancer agents that have diverse molecular targets. Consequently, DIM has moved through preclinical development into Phase I clinical trials, thereby suggesting that DIM could be a promising and novel agent either alone or as an adjunct to conventional therapeutics such as chemo-radio and targeted therapies. An important development has been the availability of DIM formulation with superior bioavailability for humans. Therefore, DIM appears to be a promising chemopreventive agent or chemo-radio-sensitizer for the prevention of tumor recurrence and/or for the treatment of human malignancies.",

Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were appropriately derived for each gene\u2013disease association using fixed and random effect models. Meta-regression with population size and genotyping method was also performed. Study quality was assessed using a 10-point scoring system designed from published guidelines. Following a review of 44 published manuscripts and one unpublished report, 80 candidate gene variants and 173 polymorphisms were analyzed among 1046 cases and 2310 controls. Majority of studies were of intermediate quality. Four polymorphisms with >3 separate studies were included in the meta-analysis [OGG1 (rs1052133), TP53 (rs1042522), CYP1A1 (rs1048943) and GSTM1 null polymorphism]. The meta-analysis demonstrated no significant associations of any of the above polymorphisms with GBC susceptibility except TP53 (rs1042522) polymorphism.

     "abstract": "Epigenetic mechanisms maintain heritable changes in gene expression and chromatin organization over many cell generations. Importantly, deregulated epigenetic mechanisms play a key role in a wide range of human malignancies, including liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which originates from the hepatocytes, is by far the most common liver cancer, with rates and aetiology that show considerable geographic variation. Various environmental agents and lifestyles known to be risk factors for HCC (such as infection by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), chronic alcohol intake, and aflatoxins) are suspected to promote its development by eliciting epigenetic changes, however the precise gene targets and underlying mechanisms have not been elucidated. Many recent studies have exploited conceptual and technological advances in epigenetics and epigenomics to investigate the role of epigenetic events induced by environmental factors in HCC tumors and non-tumor precancerous (cirrhotic) lesions. These studies have identified a large number of genes and pathways that are targeted by epigenetic deregulation (changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and RNA-mediated gene silencing) during the development and progression of HCC. Frequent identification of aberrant epigenetic changes in specific genes in cirrhotic tissue is consistent with the notion that epigenetic deregulation of selected genes in pre-malignant lesions precedes and promotes the development of HCC. In addition, several lines of evidence argue that some environmental factors (such as HBV virus) may abrogate cellular defense systems, induce silencing of host genes and promote HCC development via an \u201cepigenetic strategy\u201d. Finally, profiling studies reveal that HCC tumors and pre-cancerous lesions may exhibit epigenetic signatures associated with specific risk factors and tumor progression stage. Together, recent evidence underscores the importance of aberrant epigenetic events induced by environmental factors in liver cancer and highlights potential targets for biomarker discovery and future preventive and therapeutic strategies.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetic modifications characterized by DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodeling are important regulators in a number of biological processes, including spermatogenesis. Several genes in the testes are regulated through epigenetic mechanisms, indicating a direct influence of epigenetic mechanisms on the process of spermatogenesis. In the present article, we have provided a comprehensive review of the epigenetic processes in the testes, correlation of epigenetic aberrations with male infertility, impact of environmental factors on the epigenome and male fertility, and significance of epigenetic changes/aberrations in assisted reproduction. The literature review suggested a significant impact of epigenetic aberrations (epimutations) on spermatogenesis, and this could lead to male infertility. Epimutations (often hypermethylation) in several genes, namely MTHFR, PAX8, NTF3, SFN, HRAS, JHM2DA, IGF2, H19, RASGRF1, GTL2, PLAG1, D1RAS3, MEST, KCNQ1, LIT1, and SNRPN, have been reported in association with poor semen parameters or male infertility. Environmental toxins/drugs may affect fertility via epigenetic modifications. For example, 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, an anticancer agent, causes a decrease in global DNA methylation that leads to altered sperm morphology, decreased sperm motility, decreased fertilization capacity, and decreased embryo survival. Similarly, Endocrine disruptors, such as methoxychlor (an estrogenic pesticide) and vinclozolin (an anti-androgenic fungicide) have been found by experiments on animals to affect epigenetic modifications that may cause spermatogenic defects in subsequent generations. Assisted reproduction procedures that have been considered rather safe, are now being implicated in inducing epigenetic changes that could affect fertility in subsequent generations. Techniques such as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and round spermatid injection (ROSI) may increase the incidence of imprinting disorders and adversely affect embryonic development by using immature spermatozoa that may not have established proper imprints or global methylation. Epigenetic changes, in contrast to genetic aberrations, may be less deleterious because they are potentially reversible. Further research could identify certain drugs capable of reversing epigenetic changes.",

Asbestos, quartz and chromium and cadmium compounds were assigned to classes of highest carcinogenic potency. After 20 years of occupational exposure to long-term average concentrations of 0.5\u00a0mg/m3 of these dusts \u2013 or to even lower concentrations \u2013 an epidemiologically detectable increased lung cancer risk has to be expected. In contrast, diesel engine emissions, some nickel species and \u201cultrafine\u201d versions (nanomaterials) of titanium dioxide and carbon black were also carcinogenic in inhalation studies, but show varied epidemiological results. The high frequency of lung cancer in the male general population due to cigarette smoking hampers unequivocal detection of occupationally caused lung cancer risks. Based on the experience from the inhalation studies, workers had to be exposed to long-term concentrations of 1\u00a0mg/m3 or more to identify epidemiologically a clear cause-and-effect relationship for a specific substance of intermediate potency. Respirable granular biodurable particles without known significant specific toxicity with primary particle sizes of more than 1\u00a0\u03bcm have also shown carcinogenicity in rats. Their potency was even lower; and partially results after instillation rather than inhalation are available. Nearly all types of nanomaterials and control dusts used in the in vitro assays showed genotoxic effects in cell cultures (e.g., CoCr particles, diesel soot, SiO2 crystalline and amorphous, TiO2, carbon black), but not consistently in all studies; overall, the proportion of positive results was about 50%. No clear correlation of the probability of a positive in vitro test with particle properties was seen. I recommend trying and calibrating a sensitive in vitro model (e.g., micronucleus assay) against the described rank order of carcinogenic potency by testing a series of inorganic substances.",

The \u2018macro fold\u2019 is roughly 25\u00a0kDa in size and is composed of a mixed \u03b1\u2013\u03b2 fold with similarity to the P loop-containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. They function as binding modules for metabolites of NAD+, including poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR), which is synthesized by PAR polymerases (PARPs). Although there is a high degree of sequence similarity within this family, particularly for residues that might be involved in catalysis or substrates binding, it is likely that the sequence variation that does exist among macro domains is responsible for the specificity of function of individual proteins. Recent findings have indicated that macro domain proteins are functionally promiscuous and are implicated in the regulation of diverse biological functions, such as DNA repair, chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation. Significant advances in the field of macro domain have occurred in the past few years, including biological insights and the discovery of novel signaling pathways. To provide a framework for understanding these recent findings, this review will provide a comprehensive overview of the known and proposed biochemical, cellular and physiological roles of the macro domain family. Recent data that indicate a critical role of macro domain regulation for the proper progression of cellular differentiation programs will be discussed. In addition, the effect of dysregulated expression of macro domain proteins will be considered in the processes of tumorigenesis and bacterial pathogenesis. Finally, a series of observations will be highlighted that should be addressed in future efforts to develop macro domains as effective therapeutic targets.",

     "abstract": "During bacterial replication, DNA polymerases may encounter DNA lesions that block processive DNA synthesis. Uncoupling the replicative helicase from the stalled DNA polymerase results in the formation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps, which are repaired by postreplication repair (PRR), a process that involves at least three mechanisms that collectively remove, circumvent or bypass lesions. RecA mediated excision repair (RAMER) and homologous recombination (HR) are strand-exchange mechanisms that appear to be the predominent strategies for gap repair in the absence of prolonged SOS induction. During RAMER, RecA mediates pairing of damaged ssDNA with an undamaged homologous duplex and subsequent exchange of strands between the damaged and undamaged DNA. Repair of the lesion occurs in the context of the strand-exchange product and is initiated by UvrABC excinuclease; the resulting patch is filled by DNA synthesis using the complementary strand of the homologous duplex as a template. HR uses a complementary strand of an undamaged homologous duplex as a transient template for DNA synthesis. HR requires the formation and resolution of Holliday junctions, and is a mechanism to circumvent the lesion; lesions persisting in one of the daughter DNA duplexes will normally be repaired prior to subsequent rounds of replication/cell division. Translesion DNA Synthesis (TLS) does not involve strand-exchange mechanisms; it is carried out by specialized DNA polymerases that are able to catalyze nucleotide incorporation opposite lesions that cannot be bypassed by high-fidelity replicative polymerases. Maximum levels of TLS occur during prolonged SOS induction generally associated with increased mutagenesis. RAMER, HR and TLS are alternative mechanisms for processing a common intermediate\u2014the ssDNA gap containing a RecA nucleofilament. The actual pathway that is utilized will be strongly influenced by multiple factors, including the blocking/coding capacity of the lesion, the nature of the gene products that can be assembled at the ssDNA gap, the availability of a homologous partner for RAMER and HR, and protein:protein interactions and post-translational modifications that modulate the mutagenic activity of Pol-IV and Pol-V.",

     "abstract": "Genetic polymorphisms are increasingly recognized as sources of variability not only in toxicokinetic but also in toxicodynamic response to environmental agents. XRCC1 is involved in base excision repair (BER) of DNA; it has variant genotypes that are associated with modified repair function. This analysis focuses on four polymorphisms: three in the coding region that affect protein structure and one in an upstream regulatory sequence that affects gene expression. The Arg399Gln variant is the most widely studied with evidence supporting a quantitative effect of genotype on phenotype. The homozygous variant (Gln/Gln) can have 3\u20134-fold diminished capacity to remove DNA adducts and oxidized DNA damage. This variant is relatively common in Caucasians and Asians where approximately 10% are homozygous variant. In contrast, the Arg194Trp variant appears to protect against genotoxic effects although the degree to which DNA repair is enhanced by this polymorphism is uncertain. The homozygous variant is rare in Caucasians and African Americans but it is present at 7% in Asians. A third coding region polymorphism at codon 280 appears to decrease repair function but additional quantitative information is needed and the homozygous variant is rare across populations studied. A polymorphism in an upstream promoter binding sequence (\u221277T\u00a0>\u00a0C) appears to lower XRCC1 levels by decreasing gene expression. Based upon genotype effect on phenotype and allele frequency, the current analysis finds that the codon 399 and upstream (\u221277) polymorphisms have the greatest potential to affect the toxicodynamic response to DNA damaging agents. However, the implications for risk assessment are limited by the likelihood that polymorphisms in multiple BER genes interact to modulate DNA repair.",

     "publication date": "04-2011",
     "abstract": "The occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms has increased significantly in many regions of the world in the last century due to water eutrophication. These blooms are hazardous to humans, animals, and plants due to the production of cyanotoxins, which can be classified in five different groups: hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins, dermatotoxins, and irritant toxins (lipopolysaccharides). There is evidence that certain cyanobacterial toxins are genotoxic and carcinogenic; however, the mechanisms of their potential carcinogenicity are not well understood. The most frequently occurring and widespread cyanotoxins in brackish and freshwater blooms are the cyclic heptapeptides, i.e., microcystins (MCs), and the pentapeptides, i.e., nodularins (NODs). The main mechanism associated with potential carcinogenic activity of MCs and NOD is the inhibition of protein phosphatases, which leads to the hyperphosphorylation of cellular proteins, which is considered to be associated with their tumor-promoting activity. Apart from this, MCs and NOD induce increased formation of reactive oxygen species and, consequently, oxidative DNA damage. There is also evidence that MCs and NOD induce micronuclei, and NOD was shown to have aneugenic activity. Both cyanotoxins interfere with DNA damage repair pathways, which, along with DNA damage, is an important factor involved in the carcinogenicity of these agents. Furthermore, these toxins increase the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and early-response genes, including proto-oncogenes, genes involved in the response to DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Rodent studies indicate that MCs and NOD are tumor promotors, whereas NOD is thought to have also tumor-initiating activity. Another cyanobacterial toxin, cylindrospermopsin (CYN), which has been neglected for a long time, is lately being increasingly found in the freshwater environment. The principal mechanism of its toxicity is the irreversible inhibition of protein synthesis. It is pro-genotoxic, and metabolic activation by cytochrome P-450 enzymes is needed for its genotoxic activity. In metabolically competent cells, it induces DNA strand breaks and exerts clastogenic and aneugenic activity. In addition, CYN increased the expression of p53 regulated genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. It also has cell transforming potential, and limited preliminary rodent studies indicate that CYN could have tumor-initiating activity. In 2010, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified MCLR as possible human carcinogen (Group 2B). Although there is not enough available information for the classification of other cyanobacterial toxins, the existing data from in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that NOD and especially CYN may be even more hazardous than MCLR to human and animal health. In addition in the environment, cyanobacterial toxins occur in complex mixtures as well as together with other anthropogenic contaminants, and numerous studies showed that the toxic/genotoxic potential of the extracts from cyanobacterial scums is higher than that of purified toxins. This means that the mixtures of toxins to which humans are exposed may pose higher health risks than estimated from the toxicological data of a single toxin. Future research efforts should focus on the elucidation of the carcinogenic potential of NOD, CYN, and the mixture of cyanobacterial extracts, as well as on the identification of possible novel toxins.",

EDC has been found in ambient and residential air samples, as well as in groundwater, surface water and drinking water. EDC has been well-studied in a variety of genotoxicity assays, and appears to involve the metabolic activation of the parent compound. We critically evaluated the genotoxicity data of EDC and its metabolites as part of an evaluation of carcinogenic mechanisms of action of EDC. EDC is genotoxic in multiple test systems via multiple routes of exposure. EDC has been shown to induce DNA adduct formation, gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations in the presence of key activation enzymes (including CYP450s and/or GSTs) in laboratory animal and in vitro studies. EDC was negative for clastogenesis as measured by the micronucleus assay in mice. In general, an increased level of DNA damage is observed related to the GSH-dependent bioactivation of EDC. Increased chromosomal aberrations with increased CYP450 expression were suggestive of a role for the oxidative metabolites of EDC in inducing chromosomal damage. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that EDC exposure, in the presence of key enzymes (including CYP450s and/or GSTs), leads to DNA adduct formation, gene mutations and chromosomal aberrations.",

     "abstract": "Gene\u2013environment interactions contribute to complex disease development. The environmental contribution, in particular low-level and prevalent environmental exposures, may constitute much of the risk and contribute substantially to disease. Systematic risk evaluation of the majority of human chemical exposures, has not been conducted and is a goal of regulatory agencies in the U.S. and worldwide. With the recent recognition that toxicological approaches more predictive of effects in humans are required for risk assessment, in vitro human cell line data as well as animal data are being used to identify toxicity mechanisms that can be translated into biomarkers relevant to human exposure studies. In this review, we discuss how data from toxicogenomic studies of exposed human populations can inform risk assessment, by generating biomarkers of exposure, early effect, and/or susceptibility, elucidating mechanisms of action underlying exposure-related disease, and detecting response at low doses. Good experimental design incorporating precise, individual exposure measurements, phenotypic anchors (pre-disease or traditional toxicological markers), and a range of relevant exposure levels, is necessary. Further, toxicogenomic studies need to be designed with sufficient power to detect true effects of the exposure. As more studies are performed and incorporated into databases such as the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD) and Chemical Effects in Biological Systems (CEBS), data can be mined for classification of newly tested chemicals (hazard identification), and, for investigating the dose\u2013response, and inter-relationship among genes, environment and disease in a systems biology approach (risk characterization).",

     "abstract": "The results of predictive toxicogenomics investigations over the past 6 years reviewed in this report have shed new light on the potential of molecular expression analysis to more properly classify both genotoxic and nongenotoxic carcinogens and to predict the carcinogenicity of untested chemicals. Predictive toxicogenomics uses global molecular expression data resulting from genomic perturbation (e.g., transcription or gene expression profiles) to predict a toxicological outcome, such as carcinogenicity. The classification of carcinogens has become an essential and highly debatable component of cancer risk assessment largely because of the default assumptions that drive regulatory decision-making regarding the presumed linearity of the dose\u2013response curve for genotoxic carcinogens. Nongenotoxic mechanisms of carcinogenesis complicate the well-established relationship between genotoxicity and carcinogenicity and challenge the interpretation of the results of rodent carcinogenicity studies in terms of their relevance to humans. Although the number of presumed nongenotoxic rodent carcinogens has dramatically increased over the past two decades, the fact remains that more than 90% of the known human carcinogens are detected in conventional short-term tests for genotoxicity and induce tumors at multiple sites in rodents. In toxicogenomics studies, a strong DNA damage response at the gene expression level suggests direct DNA modification whereas increased expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression is more characteristic of the indirect-acting agents such as those that induce oxidative stress. Metabolism genes are prominently represented among gene expression profiles that discriminate nongenotoxic modes of action (e.g., cytotoxicity and regenerative proliferation, xenobiotic receptor agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors, or hormonal-mediated processes). The evidence accumulated to date suggests that gene expression profiles reflect underlying modes or mechanisms of action, such that they will be useful in the prediction of chemical carcinogenicity, especially in conjunction with conventional short-term tests for gene mutation, chromosomal aberration and aneuploidy.",

A forward mutational assay was also developed, which is a gain of function assay that also detects bps exclusively. Later work with both assays focused on establishing that a mutation was fixed in vivo using single-burst analysis: determining the number of mutant progeny virus from an electroporated cell by dividing the culture into aliquots before scoring mutants. We review results obtained from single-burst analysis, including testing the hypothesis that high m utant f requencie s (MFs) of G:C to A:T mutation recovered by transgenic targets include significant numbers of unrepaired G:T mismatches. Comparison between the \u03a6X174 and lacI transgenes in mouse spleen indicates that the spontaneous bps m utation f requency per n ucleotide (mfn) is not significantly lower for \u03a6X174 than for lacI; the response to ENU is also comparable. For the lacI transgene, the spontaneous bps mfn is highly age-dependent up to 12 weeks of age and the linear trend extrapolates at conception to a frequency close to the human bps mfn per generation of 1.7\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22128. Unexpectedly, we found that the lacI somatic (spleen) bps mfn per cell division at early ages was estimated to be the same as for the human germ-line. The bps mfn in bone marrow for the gpt transgene is comparable to spleen for the lacI and \u03a6X174 transgenes. We conclude that the G:C to A:T transition is characteristic of spontaneous in vivo mutation and that the MFs measured in these transgenes at early ages reflect the expected accumulation of in vivo mutation typical of endogenous mammalian mutation rates. However, spontaneous and induced mfns per nucleotide for the cII gene in spleen are 5\u201310 times higher than for these other transgenes.",

These same proteins also participate in base excision repair and nucleotide excision repair. In eukaryotes they regulate not just DNA repair but also meiotic recombination, cell-cycle delay and/or apoptosis in response to DNA damage, and hypermutation in immunoglobulin genes. Significantly, the same DNA mismatches that trigger repair in some circumstances trigger non-repair pathways in others.

In this paper we will review: (i) sources of the origin of uracil in DNA; (ii) some properties of the enzymes responsible for the excision of uracil and their role in the Ig diversification process, which comprises somatic hypermutation and class switch recombination; and (iii) consequences of cytosine deamination in other than the Ig loci, in cell types different than B lymphocytes. Furthermore, the issue concerning the basal level of uracil in DNA and consequences of the presence of U:A pairs for DNA stability and cell functions will be discussed. Finally, we will discuss the clinical significance of aberrant uracil incorporation into DNA and possible involvement of aberrantly expressed AID and the enzyme-induced presence of uracil, in carcinogenesis.Based on the literature data we conclude/hypothesize that the non-canonical base uracil may be present and well tolerated in DNA mostly as U:A pairs, likely in quantities of 104 per genome. Although a role of uracil in DNA is not fully defined, it is possible that an ancestral system which once used uracil in primordial genetic material (uracil-DNA), may have evolved to use this molecule in regulatory processes such as: (i) meiotic cell division to facilitate chromatid exchange during crossing-over (in spermatocytes); (ii) it is possible that uracil present in DNA may be a signaling molecule during metamorphosis of Drosophila melanogaster; and (iii) during transcription since some regulatory proteins (Escherichia coli lac repressor) and GCN4 can recognize uracil versus thymine in specific DNA regulatory sequences. Moreover, recent data suggest that in transcriptionally active chromatin the dUTP/dTTP pool may be significantly increased, which in turn may lead to massive uracil incorporation into DNA.",

Different studies have found that transcription variants, also known as isoforms, which are generated by the alternative splicing of exons and introns in mRNA that encodes many of the regulator proteins of chromosomal segregation, have an important role in mechanisms that lead to CIN. The majority of these isoforms are newly described. The discovery of additional isoforms and the study of their mechanisms of action allow a more integrated view of how cells regulate the segregation of their genetic material, and of how errors occur in chromosomal segregation.",

Since the introduction of mobile phones many studies have been conducted regarding alleged health effects but there is still some uncertainty and no definitive conclusions have been reached so far. Although thermal effects are well understood they are not of great concern as they are unlikely to result from the typical low-level RFR exposures. Concern rests essentially with the possibility that RFR-exposure may induce non-thermal and/or long-term health effects such as an increased cancer risk. Consequently, possible genetic effects have often been studied but with mixed results. In this paper we review the data on alleged RFR-induced genetic effects from in vitro and in vivo investigations as well as from human cytogenetic biomonitoring surveys. Attention is also paid to combined exposures of RFR with chemical or physical agents. Again, however, no entirely consistent picture emerges. Many of the positive studies may well be due to thermal exposures, but a few studies suggest that biological effects can be seen at low levels of exposure. Overall, however, the evidence for low-level genotoxic effects is very weak.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetics, as it pertains to biology and toxicology, can be defined as heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve mutations and are propagated without continued stimulus. Although potentially reversible, these heritable changes may be classified as mitotic, meiotic, or transgenerational, implicating the wide-ranging impact of epigenetic control in cellular function. A number of biological responses have been classified as being caused by an \u201cepigenetic alteration,\u201d sometimes based on sound scientific evidence and often in lieu of an identified genetic mutation. Complicating the understanding and interpretation of perceived epigenetic alterations is an incomplete understanding of the normal state and dynamic variation of the epigenome, which can differ widely between cell and tissue types and stage of development or age. This emerging field is likely to have a profound impact on the study and practice of toxicology in coming years. This document reviews the current state of the science in epigenetic modifications, techniques used to measure these changes, and evaluates the current toxicology testing battery with respect to strengths and potential weaknesses in the identification of epigenetics changes. In addition, case studies implicating transgenerational effects induced by diethylstilbestrol, vinclozolin, and bisphenol A were reviewed to illustrate the application of epigenetics in safety assessment and the strengths and limitations of the study designs. An assessment of toxicology tests currently used in safety evaluation revealed that these tests are expected to identify any potential adverse outcomes resulting from epigenetic changes. Furthermore, in order to increase our understanding of the science of epigenetics in toxicology, this review has revealed that a solid understanding of the biology and variation in the epigenome is essential to contextualize concerns about possible adverse health effects related to epigenetic changes. Finally, the fundamental principles guiding toxicology studies, including relevant doses, dose-rates, routes of exposure, and experimental models, need to be taken into consideration in the design and interpretation of studies within this emerging area of science.",

In single gene disorders of higher frequency, especially X-linked ones, the frequency of combined germ-line and somatic mosaicism is increasingly being appreciated, e.g. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Cell separation techniques; such as the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) also detect much somatic mosaicism among blood cells in disorders such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. Depending on the disorder and the class of mutation, in genes for which there are sufficient numbers of patients studied, 6\u201320% of cases are due to somatic mutation. This update of my previous review is stimulated by the rapid application of new technologies for the study of DNA variation in disease. The results of these studies implicate somatic mutation in a greater variety of genetic diseases and a wider spectrum of tissues than have previously been shown, including heart and kidney. The classes of mutation have also expanded beyond base pair changes, insertions/deletion (indels), and short tandem repeat mutations to include copy number variants and transposon-mediated mutations. I also briefly discuss previously well-known mosaicism for chromosomal mutations. Genomic sequencing, performed on DNA from blood, shows many mutations which are conclusively somatic in origin. It is still too early to see if there is a different pattern of somatic mutation compared to germ-line mutation. Though the parameters to allow careful quantification are not yet available, it seems that the frequency of gene mutation in embryonic cells is not markedly different than that in the germ line.",

Assays for assessment of DNA repair phenotype should be well characterized in terms of reliability, validity, sensitivity, inter- and intra-individual variability, and cancer predictivity.Our comparison reveals that the G1 and G2 challenge assays, although labour-intensive, can be considered as very useful assays to investigate DNA repair phenotype. They have been successfully applied to investigate repair capacity of both cancer patients and environmentally exposed populations, and can detect deficiencies in different repair pathways. Moreover, these assays allow to predict the cancer therapy responses and to investigate the cancer prognosis.Nevertheless, the choice of the assay depends on the scientific question addressed and on the objective of its application and more prospective studies are needed since the phenotype could reflect the pathophysiological alterations in the patient secondary to the disease.",

Understanding toxicokinetics (uptake, biotransformation, distribution, and elimination processes) is a key precondition to understanding the individual health risks associated with exposure. We selected candidate susceptibility genes when evidence was available for (1) genes/proteins playing a significant role in mercury and lead toxicokinetics, (2) gene expression/protein activity being induced by these metals, and (3) mercury and lead toxicokinetics being affected by gene knockout/knockdown or (4) by functional gene polymorphisms. The genetic background is far better known for mercury than for lead toxicokinetics. Involved are genes encoding L-type amino acid transporters, organic anion transporters, glutathione (GSH)-related enzymes, metallothioneins, and transporters of the ABC family. Certain gene variants can influence mercury toxicokinetics, potentially explaining part of the variable susceptibility to mercury toxicity. Delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), vitamin D receptor (VDR) and hemochromatosis (HFE) gene variants are the only well-established susceptibility markers of lead toxicity in humans. Many gaps remain in our knowledge about the functional genomics of this issue. This calls for studies to detect functional gene polymorphisms related to mercury- and lead-associated disease phenotypes, to demonstrate the impact of functional polymorphisms and gene knockout/knockdown in relation to toxicity, to confirm the in vivo relevance of genetic variation, and to examine gene\u2013gene interactions on the respective toxicokinetics. Another crucial aspect is knowledge on the maternal-fetal genetic background, which modulates fetal exposure to these neurotoxicants. To completely define the genetically susceptible risk groups, research is also needed on the genes/proteins involved in the toxicodynamics, i.e., in the mechanisms causing adverse effects in the brain. Studies relating the toxicogenetics to neurodevelopmental disorders are lacking (mercury) or very scarce (lead).

     "abstract": "Skin pigmentation is one of the most overt human physical traits with consequences on susceptibility to skin cancer. The variations in skin pigmentation are dependent on geographic location and population ethnicity. Skin colouration is mainly due to the pigmentation substance melanin, produced in specialized organelles (melanosomes) within dendritic melanocytes, and transferred to neighbouring keratinocytes. The two types of melanin synthesized in well defined chemical reactions are the protective dark coloured eumelanin and the sulphur containing light red\u2013yellow pheomelanin. The events leading to the synthesis of melanin are controlled by signalling cascades that involve a host of genes encoding ligands, receptors, transcription factors, channel transporters and many other crucial molecules. Several variants within the genes involved in pigmentation have been associated with high risk phenotypes like fair skin, brown\u2013red hair and green\u2013blue eyes. Many of those variants have also been implicated in the risk of various skin cancers. The variants within the key pigmentation gene, melanocortin-receptor 1 (MC1R), in particular have been ubiquitously linked with high risk traits and skin cancers involving both pigmentary and non-pigmentary functions and likely interaction with variants in other genes. Many of the variants in other genes, functional in pigmentation pathway, have also been associated with phenotypic variation and risk of skin cancers. Those genes include agouti signalling protein (ASIP), tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), oculocutaneous albinism II (OCA2), various solute carrier genes and transporters. Most of those associations have been confirmed in genome wide association studies that at the same time have also identified new loci involved in phenotypic variation and skin cancer risk. In conclusion, the genetic variants within the genes involved in skin pigmentation besides influencing phenotypic traits are important determinants of risk of several skin cancers. However, ultimate risk of skin cancer is dependent on interplay between genetic and host factors.",

Original research studies that included the measurement of urinary estrogen metabolites in human subjects were identified through an extensive Medline search; 43 distinct studies were identified, including a total of 6802 healthy women. The range of mean values of the 2/16 ratio measured with the ELISA method varied from 0.98 to 1.74; in studies of pre-menopausal women the range of mean values was 1.5\u20132.74, in studies of post-menopausal women mean values ranged from 1.15 to 2.25. The heterogeneity across studies was highly significant (p-value Q-test: <0.0001). In multivariable analyses, only race confirmed its role as an independent predictor of 2/16 ratio (F-value: 7.95; p-value: 0.009), after adjustment for age and menopausal status. There appears to be a large body of data on the 2/16 urinary ratio in healthy women. However, summary estimates are difficult to perform due to the high variability of the published study-specific values. The data suggests that race may be a contributor to 2/16 urinary ratio levels.",

On one hand, inheritable mutations are the driving force of biological evolution; on the other hand, their accumulation in somatic cells plays a key role in the development of cancer. The frequency of mutants (f) and the rate of mutation (\u03bc) are biological features of any cell population: their measurement could provide important information about the risk of oncogenesis and the exposure to carcinogenic agents. However, the measurement of these parameters is not trivial.To measure f and \u03bc, a potential sentinel gene is the PIG-A gene, which encodes one of the subunits of an enzyme essential in the biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI). Since PIG-A is X-linked, mutational inactivation of the one single copy active in somatic cells entails absence from the cell surface of all the proteins that require GPI for attachment to the membrane: thus, mutant cells display a GPI-negative surface phenotype that can be easily detected by flow cytometry. The measurement of PIG-A mutants by counting cells with the GPI-negative phenotype has proved to be effective to measure mutant frequency in peripheral blood cells of humans and of others animals. Up to now, \u03bc has been exceedingly difficult to measure in human cells; however, by using as a sentinel the PIG-A gene in lymphoblastoid cell lines we now have a test that makes it practical to measure \u03bc in human cells.",

In addition, a meta-analysis has been performed to estimate the impact of most common confounders on MN frequency, and to provide a baseline value of MN frequency in the control population.A total number of 63 eligible studies were included in the analysis. Age (98.4%), gender (85.7%), and smoking habit (90.5%) were the most commonly studied confounders. Univariate statistics were estimated in most studies while multivariate analysis was applied only in the 47.6%. Baseline MN frequency in controls was 1.10/1000 cells (95% confidence interval 0.70\u20131.72), and the relative increment in subjects exposed to genotoxic agents or affected by disease correlated with similar observations in lymphocytes (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.74). A minimum number of 4000 cells is recommended to reduce the variability of the MN mean estimates, in contrast with the current practice of scoring only 2000 cells (81% of studies). Poisson or Negative Binomial are the preferred statistical models when more than 2000 cells are scored. Studies scoring smaller numbers of cells should consider the use of statistical models taking into account the excess of zeros, e.g., the Zero Inflated Poisson (ZIP) models.The quality of papers published on the buccal MN assay can be substantially improved, with better consideration of basic issues such as power analysis, control for confounding, choice of the statistical model, and the number of cells to be scored.",

     "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is strongly associated with approximately 1/5th of all human cancers. Arising from combinations of factors such as environmental exposures, diet, inherited gene polymorphisms, infections, or from dysfunctions of the immune response, chronic inflammation begins as an attempt of the body to remove injurious stimuli; however, over time, this results in continuous tissue destruction and promotion and maintenance of carcinogenesis. Here we focus on intestinal inflammation and its associated cancers, a group of diseases on the rise and affecting millions of people worldwide. Intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into inflammatory bowel diseases (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) and celiac disease. Long-standing intestinal inflammation is associated with colorectal cancer and small-bowel adenocarcinoma, as well as extraintestinal manifestations, including lymphomas and autoimmune diseases. This article highlights potential mechanisms of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel diseases and celiac disease, as well as those involved in the progression to associated cancers, most of which have been identified from studies utilizing mouse models of intestinal inflammation. Mouse models of intestinal inflammation can be widely grouped into chemically induced models; genetic models, which make up the bulk of the studied models; adoptive transfer models; and spontaneous models. Studies in these models have lead to the understanding that persistent antigen exposure in the intestinal lumen, in combination with loss of epithelial barrier function, and dysfunction and dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune responses lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. Transcriptional changes in this environment leading to cell survival, hyperplasia, promotion of angiogenesis, persistent DNA damage, or insufficient repair of DNA damage due to an excess of proinflammatory mediators are then thought to lead to sustained malignant transformation. With regards to extraintestinal manifestations such as lymphoma, however, more suitable models are required to further investigate the complex and heterogeneous mechanisms that may be at play.",

     "abstract": "Micronuclei are good markers of genotoxic exposure in humans and their scoring has been extensively used to identify potential genotoxic agents. Micronuclei are also indicators of chromosomal instability, since the frequency of micronuclei is higher in tumour cells and cells with a defective DNA damage repair system or disrupted cell cycle checkpoint machinery. Despite the widespread use of this biomarker, information on the basic biology of micronuclei and the impact of micronuclei on the cell is relatively controversial. In some cell systems, micronuclei are considered to be genetic material that is lost for the cell; whereas other studies suggest that micronuclear DNA is actively transcribed and its genes are fully expressed. Recently, evidence has accumulated suggesting that damaged DNA entrapped in micronuclei induces a defective cell cycle checkpoint arrest and DNA repair response, and that micronuclear content can be degraded without inducing an immediate cell cycle arrest or causing the cell to enter apoptosis. Overall, these findings emphasise the important consequences of micronucleus formation in terms of chromosomal instability in general and gene loss in particular.",

Genotoxic stress can induce a wide variety of DNA lesions. Among these DNA alterations are double-stranded breaks and single-stranded DNA gaps. Repair of these DNA alterations requires damage recognition and resection. Here we discuss how DNA repair and DNA damage checkpoints cooperate and deal with DNA damage. Processing of DNA lesions by structure-specific nucleases results in DNA\u2013protein intermediates, which form the basis for checkpoint activation and DNA repair. Post-translational modifications like phosphorylation and ubiquitination modulate the DNA damage response in a spatial and temporal manner.

     "abstract": "Among cell cycle regulatory proteins that are activated following DNA damage, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21CDKN1A plays essential roles in the DNA damage response, by inducing cell cycle arrest, direct inhibition of DNA replication, as well as by regulating fundamental processes, like apoptosis and transcription. These functions are performed through the ability of p21 to interact with a number of proteins involved in these processes. Despite an initial controversy, during the last years several lines of evidence have also indicated that p21 may be directly involved in DNA repair. In particular, the participation of p21 in nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), and DNA translesion synthesis (TLS), has been suggested to occur thanks to its interaction with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a crucial protein involved in several aspects of DNA metabolism, and cell-cycle regulation.In this review, the multiple roles of p21 in the DNA damage response, including regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis and gene transcription, are discussed together with the most recent findings supporting the direct participation of p21 protein in DNA repair processes. In particular, spatio-temporal dynamics of p21 recruitment to sites of DNA damage will be considered together with several lines of evidence indicating a regulatory role for p21. In addition, the relevance of post-translational regulation in the fate (e.g. degradation) of p21 protein after cell exposure to DNA damaging agents will be analyzed. Both sets of evidence will be discussed in terms of the overall DNA damage response.",

     "abstract": "The present review focuses on studies carried out by our group on the interaction of UV radiation with DNA. In particular, we examine the way that the energy acquired by DNA helices following direct absorption of UVC radiation is extended spatially and how its effects evolve during the time. These effects depend on the base sequence and can be revealed by the study of model helices. The experimental results were obtained by optical spectroscopy, used in a refined way which allows detection of very weak absorbance changes (10\u22123) as well as of intrinsic emission from DNA components whose fluorescence quantum yields are as low as 10\u22124. Measurements were performed both under continuous irradiation and using pulsed excitation which permitted us to follow early events, occurring from 10\u221214 to 10\u22121\u00a0s. The experiments were guided by theoretical calculations.The spatial features concern the extent of the excited states formed immediately upon UV absorption; these were shown to be delocalized over several bases under the effect of electronic coupling. Moreover, thanks to the spectral fingerprints governed by the electronic coupling; we probed local denaturation induced on a double helix following formation of cyclobutane dimers.Regarding the temporal features, three different topics are presented: (i) ultrafast excitation energy transfer occurring among the bases in less than 100\u00a0fs, (ii) electron ejection from DNA upon absorption of one photon at 266\u00a0nm and (iii) formation of (6-4) photo-adducts involving a reaction intermediate.The most important message emerging from these studies is that DNA bases may adopt a collective behaviour versus UV radiation. Furthermore, time-resolved studies unravel processes which are undetectable by investigations using continuous irradiation. All these pieces of information change our understanding of how DNA damage occurs upon absorption of UV radiation.",

     "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the main types of damage induced by ionizing radiations. Free DNA ends that are not correctly repaired can be engaged in pathways triggering gene amplification. Following gene amplification the copy number of a portion of the genome is increased, leading to an enhanced expression of the genes located in the amplified region. Gene amplification plays an important role in cancer, being one of the mechanisms of oncogene activation; in addition, it can confer resistance to chemotherapeutic agents, through the increase in the copy number of genes coding for drug targets. The presence of gene amplification can have a prognostic and a diagnostic value and can help in orienting therapy in specific tumour types. The amplified DNA is primarily produced through recombination-based pathways and can be located either within chromosomes or on extra-chromosomal acentric elements. Studies on the organization of the amplified DNA in tumour cells and in cultured drug resistant cells have suggested that a single DSB can trigger a cascade of events leading to a large number of copies of a region of the genome. In addition, it has been shown that amplified DNA is unstable, further increasing the long-term effect of the initial event. Gene amplification is a peculiar feature of transformed cells and the ability to amplify is strongly influenced by the cellular genetic background. Genes involved in DNA damage response and in DNA damage repair can play a role in controlling the amplification process, in particular, it has been shown that defects in DSB repair functions can increase the frequency of gene amplification. In this review, we will discuss the biological significance of gene amplification, together with the role of DNA DSBs and DSB repair genes in the generation of amplified DNA.",

     "abstract": "Laser induced radiation microbeam technology for radiobiology research is undergoing rapid growth because of the increased availability and ease of use of femtosecond laser sources. The main processes involved are multiphoton absorption and/or plasma formation. The high peak powers these lasers generate make them ideal tools for depositing sub-micrometer size radiant energy within a region of a living cell nucleus to activate ionising and/or photochemically driven processes. The technique allows questions relating to the effects of low doses of radiation, the propagation and treatment of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage and repair in individual live cells as well as non-targeted cell to cell effects to be addressed. This mini-review focuses on the use of near infrared (NIR) ca. 800\u00a0nm radiation to induce damage that is radically different from the early and subsequent ultraviolet microbeam techniques. Ultrafast pulsed NIR instrumentation has many benefits including the ability to eliminate issues of unspecific UV absorption by the many materials prevalent within cells. The multiphoton interaction volume also permits energy deposition beyond the diffraction limit. Work has established that the fundamental process of the damage induced by the ultrashort laser pulses is different to those induced from continuous wave light sources. Pioneering work has demonstrated that NIR laser microbeam radiation can mimic ionising radiation via multiphoton absorption within the 3D femtolitre volume of the highly focused Gaussian beam. This light-matter interaction phenomenon provides a novel optical microbeam probe for mimicking both complex ionising and UV radiation-type cell damage including double strand breaks (DSBs) and base damage. A further advantage of the pulsed laser technique is that it provides further scope for time-resolved experiments. Recently the NIR laser microbeam technique has been used to investigate the recruitment of repair proteins to the sub-micrometre size area of damage in viable cells using both immuno-fluorescent staining of \u03b3-H2AX (a marker for DSBs) and real-time imaging of GFP-labelled repair proteins including ATM, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), RAD51 and Ku 70/80 to elucidate the interaction of the two DNA DSB repair pathways, homologous recombination and the non-homologous end joining pathway.",

     "abstract": "Theoretical simulations are particularly well suited to investigate, at a molecular level, direct and indirect effects of ionising radiations in DNA, as in the particular case of irradiation by swift heavy ions such as those used in hadron therapy. In the past recent years, we have developed the modeling at the microscopic level of the early stages of the Coulomb explosion of DNA molecules immersed in liquid water that follows the irradiation by swift heavy ions. To that end, Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory molecular dynamics simulations (TD-DFT MD) have been developed where localised Wannier orbitals are propagated. This latter enables to separate molecular orbitals of each water molecule from the molecular orbitals of the biomolecule.Our main objective is to demonstrate that the double ionisation of one molecule of the liquid sample, either one water molecule from the solvent or the biomolecule, may be in some cases responsible for the formation of an atomic oxygen as a direct consequence of the molecule Coulomb explosion. Our hypothesis is that the molecular double ionisation arising from irradiation by swift heavy ions (about 10% of ionisation events by ions whose velocity is about the third of speed of light), as a primary event, though maybe less probable than other events resulting from the electronic cascading (for instance, electronic excitations, electron attachments), may be systematically more damageable (and more lethal), as supported by experiments that have been carried out in our group in the 1990s (in studies of damages created by K holes in DNA). The chemical reactivity of the produced atomic oxygen with other radicals present in the medium will ultimately lead to chemical products that are harmful to DNA.In the present paper, we review our theoretical methodology in an attempt that the community be familiar with our new approach. Results on the production of atomic oxygen as a result of the double ionisation of water or as a result of the double ionisation of the Uracil RNA base will be presented.",

Charged particle irradiation has recently emerged as a tool to generate discrete sites of subnuclear damage by its means of extremely localised dose deposition at low energies, thus facilitating the spatiotemporal analysis of repair events. In addition, they are of high interest for risk estimations of human space exploration (e.g. mars mission) in the high energy regime (HZE). In this short review we will give examples for the application of charged particle irradiation to study spatiotemporal aspects of DNA damage recognition and repair in the context of recent achievements in this field.Beamline microscopy allows determining the exact kinetics of repair-related proteins after irradiation with different charged particles that induce different lesion densities. The classification into fast recruited proteins like DNA-PK or XRCC1 or slower recruited ones like 53BP1 or MDC1 helps to establish the hierarchical organisation of damage recognition and subsequent repair events. Additionally, motional analysis of DNA lesions induced by traversing particles proved information about the mobility of DSBs. Increased mobility or the absence of large scale motion has direct consequences on the formation of chromosomal translocations and, thus, on mechanisms of cancer formation. Charged particle microbeams offer the interesting perspective of precise nuclear or subnuclear targeting with a defined number of ions, avoiding the Poisson distribution of traversals inherent to broad beam experiments. With the help of the microbeam, geometrical patterns of traversing ions can be applied facilitating the analysis of spatial organisation of repair.",

     "abstract": "For decades, DNA has been considered as the main cellular target of deleterious effects of ionizing radiation (IR). Nevertheless, molecular signals initiated at cellular membranes are now identified as critical events in a large spectrum of radiation-induced cellular processes. If IR provokes DNA damage directly by energy deposit on the DNA double helix and indirectly by reactive species, origin of IR-induced molecular events initiated at the plasma membrane remains more obscure. Generation of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) inducing proteins and lipids modifications seems to be the prevalent hypothesis. However, spatial and temporal relocalization of proteins and/or lipids represents also potential mechanisms of cell signaling generation. In the context of an oxidative stress such as IR, the best example is the translocation of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) from lysosomes to the outer layer of cell membrane, which then induces sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide formation. Ceramide coalescence with cholesterol forms lipids microdomains in the plasma membrane, enhancing clustering of signaling receptors (death receptors like FAS, TNF, CD40, TRAIL or G protein-coupled receptors). In this manuscript, we propose to overview the different key molecular mechanisms induced at the plasma membrane after IR in perspective with their linked molecular actors.",

For charged particles, beams can be targeted with sub-micron accuracy into biological samples and the lowest possible dose of a single particle track can be delivered with high reproducibility. Microbeams have provided powerful tools for understanding the kinetics of DNA damage and formation under conditions of physiological relevance and have significant advantages over other approaches for producing localized DNA damage, such as variable wavelength laser beam approaches. Recent studies have extended their use to probing for radiosensitive sites outside the cell nucleus, and testing for mechanisms underpinning bystander responses where irradiated and non-irradiated cells communicate with each other.

     "abstract": "DNA damage sensing proteins have been shown to localize to the sites of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) within seconds to minutes following ionizing radiation (IR) exposure, resulting in the formation of microscopically visible nuclear domains referred to as radiation-induced foci (RIF). This review characterizes the spatiotemporal properties of RIF at physiological doses, minutes to hours following exposure to ionizing radiation, and it proposes a model describing RIF formation and resolution as a function of radiation quality and chromatin territories. Discussion is limited to RIF formed by three interrelated proteins ATM (Ataxia telangiectasia mutated), 53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1) and \u03b3H2AX (phosphorylated variant histone H2AX), with an emphasis on the later. This review discusses the importance of not equating RIF with DSB in all situations and shows how dose and time dependence of RIF frequency is inconsistent with a one to one equivalence. Instead, we propose that RIF mark regions of the chromatin that would serve as scaffolds rigid enough to keep broken DNA from diffusing away, but open enough to allow the repair machinery to access the damage site. We review data indicating clear kinetic and physical differences between RIF emerging from dense and uncondensed regions of the nucleus. We suggest that persistent RIF observed days following exposure to ionizing radiation are nuclear marks of permanent rearrangement of the chromatin architecture. Such chromatin alterations may not always lead to growth arrest as cells have been shown to replicate these in progeny. Thus, heritable persistent RIF spanning over tens of Mbp may reflect persistent changes in the transcriptome of a large progeny of cells. Such model opens the door to a \u201cnon-DNA-centric view\u201d of radiation-induced phenotypes.",

     "abstract": "The induction of DNA interstrand cross-links by ionizing radiation has been largely ignored in favour of studies on double-strand break formation and repair. At least part of the problem is technical; it is difficult to detect and quantify interstrand cross-links when the same agent forms both cross-links and single strand breaks because the detection of interstrand cross-links generally involves a denaturation step. Our group has studied the induction of interstrand cross-links following irradiation of DNA containing bromouracil at specific sites. We found that the formation of interstrand cross-links requires the presence of a few (3\u20135) mismatched bases, comprising the bromouracil. In the absence of mismatched bases, no radiation-induced cross-linking was observed; however, even in the absence of bromouracil, cross-linking still occurred, albeit at a lower efficiency. Our molecular modelling studies demonstrate that the mobility of the bases in the mismatched region is essential for the cross-linking process. Thus, our hypothesis is that ionizing radiation induces DNA interstrand cross-links in non-hybridized regions of DNA. Some obvious examples of such DNA regions are replication forks, transcription bubbles and the D-loop of telomeres. However, an abundance of studies have made it clear that there must be many single-stranded regions in the genome, such as hairpins and cruciforms. For example, alpha satellite DNA, in centromere regions of human chromosomes, forms hairpins. Thus, a variety of non-B DNA structures (hairpins, slipped DNA and tetrahelical structures) exist in the genome and should be susceptible to the formation of radiation-induced interstrand cross-links. Although interstrand cross-links have thus far been virtually ignored in radiation biology, it will be worthwhile to develop methods to detect their presence following exposure of cells to biologically relevant levels of ionizing radiation, since, on a per lesions basis, they are probably more toxic than double-strand breaks.",

It has been demonstrated that this data provides the means to assay multiple functional responses of a biological system at a spatial resolution as low as a micron within the sample. As the interaction of ionizing radiation with biological systems involves chemical reactions between the products of radiation-induced damage and various structural and functional units within the cell, the vibrational spectroscopic modalities have received attention as potential measurement platforms for the in situ examination of the chemistry of biological species in radiobiology. This presents challenges in relation to sample preparation and the construction of suitable analytical methodologies. In this work protocols for sample preparation and approaches to multivariate analysis of vibrational spectra in radiobiological analysis are detailed and the utility of the methodology in analyzing the evolution of biochemical responses to radiobiological damage are highlighted.",

     "abstract": "Exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), at environmentally and therapeutically relevant doses or as a result of diagnostics or accidents, causes cyto- and genotoxic damage. However, exposure to IR alone is a rare event as it occurs in spatial and temporal combination with several physico-chemical agents. Some of these are of known noxiousness, as is the case with chemical compounds at high dose, hence additive/synergistic effects can be expected or have been demonstrated. Conversely, the cellular toxicity of other agents, such as non-ionizing electromagnetic fields (EMFs), is only presumed and their short- and long-term cooperation on IR-induced damage remains undetermined. In this review, we shall examine evidence in support of the interplay between spatially and/or temporally related environmentally relevant stressors. In vitro or animal-based studies as well as epidemiological surveys have generally examined the combined action of no more than a couple of known or potentially DNA-damaging agents. Moreover, most existing research mainly focused on short-term effects of combined exposures. Hence, it is important that quantitative research addresses the issue of the possible cooperation between chronic exposure to environmental trace contaminants and exposure to EMFs, examining not only the modulation of damage acutely induced by IR but also long-term genome stability.",

     "abstract": "Several proteins involved in DNA repair and DNA damage signaling have been shown to produce discrete foci in response to ionizing radiation. These foci are believed to co-localize to DSB and referred to as ionizing radiation-induced foci (IRIF) or DNA repair foci.Recent studies have revealed that some residual IRIF remain in cells for a relatively long time after irradiation, and have indicated a possible correlation between radiosensitivity of cells and residual IRIF. Remarkably, residual foci are significantly larger in size than the initial foci. Increase in the size of IRIF with time upon irradiation has been found in various cell types and has partially been correlated with dynamics and fusion of initial foci.Although it is admitted that the number of IRIF reflect that of DSB, several studies report a lack of correlation between kinetics for IRIF and DSB and a lack of co-localization between DSB repair proteins. These studies suggest that some proportion of residual IRIF that depend on cell type, dose, and post-irradiation time may represent alternations in chromatin structure after DSB have been repaired or misrepaired. While precise functions of residual foci are presently unknown, their possible link to remaining chromatin alternations, nuclear matrix, apoptosis, delayed repair and misrejoining of DSB, activity of several kinases, phosphatases, and checkpoint signaling has been suggested. Another intriguing possibility is that some of DNA repair foci may mark break-points at chromosomal aberrations (CA). While this possibility has not been confirmed substantially, the residual foci seem to be useful for biological dosimetry and estimation of individual radiosensitivity in radiotherapy of cancer.",

     "abstract": "Genome stability is essential for maintaining cellular and organismal homeostasis, but it is subject to many threats. One ubiquitous threat is from a class of compounds known as reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can indiscriminately react with many cellular biomolecules including proteins, lipids, and DNA to produce a variety of oxidative lesions. These DNA oxidation products are a direct risk to genome stability, and of particular importance are oxidative clustered DNA lesions (OCDLs), defined as two or more oxidative lesions present within 10\u00a0bp of each other. ROS can be produced by exposure of cells to exogenous environmental agents including ionizing radiation, light, chemicals, and metals. In addition, they are produced by cellular metabolism including mitochondrial ATP generation. However, ROS also serve a variety of critical cellular functions and optimal ROS levels are maintained by multiple cellular antioxidant defenses. Oxidative DNA lesions can be efficiently repaired by base excision repair or nucleotide excision repair. If ROS levels increase beyond the capacity of its antioxidant defenses, the cell's DNA repair capacity can become overwhelmed, leading to the accumulation of oxidative DNA damage products including OCDLs, which are more difficult to repair than individual isolated DNA damage products. Here we focus on the induction and repair of OCDLs and other oxidatively induced DNA lesions. If unrepaired, these lesions can lead to the formation of mutations, DNA DSBs, and chromosome abnormalities. We discuss the roles of these lesions in human pathologies including aging and cancer, and in bystander effects.",

     "abstract": "Microbeam radiation therapy (MRT) uses highly collimated, quasi-parallel arrays of X-ray microbeams of 50\u2013600\u00a0keV, produced by third generation synchrotron sources, such as the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF), in France. The main advantages of highly brilliant synchrotron sources are an extremely high dose rate and very small beam divergence. High dose rates are necessary to deliver therapeutic doses in microscopic volumes, to avoid spreading of the microbeams by cardiosynchronous movement of the tissues. The minimal beam divergence results in the advantage of steeper dose gradients delivered to a tumor target, thus achieving a higher dose deposition in the target volume in fractions of seconds, with a sharper penumbra than that produced in conventional radiotherapy.MRT research over the past 20 years has yielded many results from preclinical trials based on different animal models, including mice, rats, piglets and rabbits. Typically, MRT uses arrays of narrow (\u223c25\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcm wide) microplanar beams separated by wider (100\u2013400\u00a0\u03bcm centre-to-centre) microplanar spaces. The height of these microbeams typically varies from 1 to 100\u00a0mm, depending on the target and the desired preselected field size to be irradiated. Peak entrance doses of several hundreds of Gy are surprisingly well tolerated by normal tissues, up to \u223c2\u00a0yr after irradiation, and at the same time show a preferential damage of malignant tumor tissues; these effects of MRT have now been extensively studied over nearly two decades. More recently, some biological in vivo effects of synchrotron X-ray beams in the millimeter range (0.68\u20130.95\u00a0mm, centre-to-centre distances 1.2\u20134\u00a0mm), which may differ to some extent from those of microscopic beams, have been followed up to \u223c7 months after irradiation. Comparisons between broad-beam irradiation and MRT indicate a higher tumor control for the same sparing of normal tissue in the latter, even if a substantial fraction of tumor cells are not receiving a radiotoxic level of radiation. The hypothesis of a selective radiovulnerability of the tumor vasculature versus normal blood vessels by MRT, and of the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved remains under investigation. The paper highlights the history of MRT including salient biological findings after microbeam irradiation with emphasis on the vascular components and the tolerance of the central nervous system.

     "abstract": "Stem cells have been described in most adult tissues, where they play a key role in maintaining tissue homeostasis. As they self-renew throughout life, accumulating genetic anomalies can compromise their genomic integrity and potentially give rise to cancer. Stem cells (SCs) may thus be a major target of radiation carcinogenesis. In addition, unrepaired genotoxic damage may cause cell death and stem cell pool depletion, impairing lineage functionality and accelerating aging. Developments in SC biology enabled the characterization of the responses of stem cells to genotoxic stress and their role in tissue damage. We here examine how these cells react to ionizing radiation (IR), and more specifically their radiosensitivity, stress signaling and DNA repair. We first review embryonic SCs, as a paradigm of primitive pluripotent cells, then three adult tissues, bone marrow, skin and intestine, capable of long-term regeneration and at high risk for acute radiation syndromes and long-term carcinogenesis. We discuss IR disruption of the fine balance between maintenance of tissue homeostasis and genomic stability. We show that stem cell radiosensitivity does not follow a unique model, but differs notably according to the turnover rates of the tissues.",

     "abstract": "Radiobiological models are used in modern radiotherapy to evaluate the biological effects of different treatment plans or modalities. A radiobiological model typically converts a physical quantity (e.g. absorbed dose) to a biological quantity (e.g. cell survival fraction). Currently, the linear-quadratic model (LQM) is the most widely used model. Since it is a deterministic model, the LQM naturally ignores the uncertainties arising from the stochastic randomness of energy depositions along radiation tracks and the inherent unpredictable nature of biological systems. Recently, many studies have revealed the detailed spatial and temporal distributions of DNA damages, e.g. the DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), along various types of radiation tracks traversing a cell nucleus. Studies have also been conducted to unravel the biological pathways that involve in how cells and tissues process DNA damages. As such, the author proposes to start developing a new multi-scale radiobiological model based on the \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach. The model includes a Monte Carlo procedure to treat the stochastic randomness of radiation-induced DNA damages, and it also includes the relevant intercellular and intracellular pathways to allow the DNA damages to evolve into higher-order biological endpoints, e.g. chromosome aberrations, cell death, or tumorigenesis. Because of its stochastic nature, the new model inherently addresses the uncertainty issue being ignored by LQM. More importantly perhaps is that the model opens a new way to study radiation effects that involve biological pathways, and therefore, may have a profound impact on radiotherapy in the future.",

Several methods using DNA or RNA molecules have been developed to target angiogenesis or other cellular functions in order to restore sensitivity to irradiation.

This approach is designed to quantify the most important physical, chemical, and biological phenomena taking place during and following such an irradiation in order to understand the scenario of the events leading to cell death and provide a better means for clinically necessary calculations with an adequate accuracy. On this stage, we overview the latest progress in calculating energy spectra of secondary electrons in liquid water and the results of an application of the inelastic thermal spike model to liquid water in order to calculate the heat transfer in the vicinity of the incident-ion track. The dependence of energy distributions of secondary electrons, resulting from ionization of the liquid water, on the energy of primary ions is studied in two regimes. For slow ions, a new parameterization of energy spectra in liquid water is suggested. For fast ions, different dispersion schemes on the basis of a dielectric response function approach are used and compared. Thermal spike calculations indicate a very large temperature increase in the vicinity of ion tracks near the Bragg peak during the time interval from 1 0 \u2212 15 to 1 0 \u2212 9 s after the ion\u2019s passage. An increase of pressure, as large as tens of MPa, can also be induced during that time. These effects suggest a possibility of thermo-mechanical pathways to disruption of irradiated DNA. A combination of a temperature spike and electron/hole interactions may be a dominant pathway of DNA damage.",
