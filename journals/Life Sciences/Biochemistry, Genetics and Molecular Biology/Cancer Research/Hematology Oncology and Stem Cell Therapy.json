     "abstract": "Despite the recent advances in breast cancer early detection and awareness, a significant portion of patients present with an advanced-stage disease and more patients will progress to stage IV despite adequate treatment of their initial early-stage disease. Hormone receptor (HR)-positive, Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 (HER2)-negative subtype is the commonest among all breast cancer subtypes. The management of the advanced-stage disease of this subtype has evolved significantly over the past few years. The emergence of estrogen receptor down regulators (fulvestrant), mTOR-inhibitors and the recent introduction of CDK4/6 inhibitors, like palbociclib, abemaciclib and ribociclib, has resulted in a significant and a historical improvement in treatment outcomes.In this paper, we review many of the recently reported clinical trials that led to the approval of these new drugs in the first-line settings, along with the current international guidelines.",

     "abstract": "Systemic light chain (AL) amyloidosis can lead to an acquired coagulopathy secondary to acquired factor X (aFX) deficiency. However, it is not very clear who develops aFX deficiency in AL amyloidosis.We therefore undertook this single centre, retrospective study to better characterize AL amyloidosis-associated aFX deficiency.Out of 121 AL patients who had FX testing at the time of their first evaluation at our institution, including 17 patients on warfarin at the time of testing, 10 out of 104 patients (9.6%) with systemic AL amyloidosis were found to have FX levels below 50%. Acquired FX deficiency was associated with advanced stage of AL amyloidosis and elevated cardiac biomarkers. Lower FX activity, advanced stage, and cardiac involvement by disease were associated with higher hazard of death on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, stage of AL amyloidosis was the only significant predictor of survival. Median survival time of patients with FX deficiency was 9.3 months compared to 118.4 months in those without.We conclude that while aFX deficiency is rare in systemic AL amyloidosis, it is a marker of advanced disease.",

     "abstract": "Certain hemostatic anomalies found in patients with thalassemia suggest the existence of a chronic hypercoagulable state. Several etiologic factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of the hypercoagulable state in those patients. One of these factors is abnormal thalassemic red blood cells (RBCs), which may provide a procoagulant. To substantiate these findings, we measured the ability of RBCs from thalassemia patients to bind annexin V with increased fraction of platelets carrying the activation marker CD62P (P-selectin). To study the expression of RBC annexin V and platelets P-selectin in study patients (those with thalassemia major, thalassemia intermedia, thalassemia minor) and control group, four-color flow cytometry was performed and the correlation between these two markers was evaluated.A case\u2013control study was conducted on 50 \u03b2-thalassemia patients (10 patients with thalassemia minor, 30 patients with thalassemia major, and 10 patients with thalassemia intermedia, with 10 normal adult volunteers as a control) from June 2016 to March 2017. Flow cytometry was used to study the expression of anionic phospholipids (Annexin V) on the RBCs and CD62P (P-selectin) on the activated platelet.The mean expression of annexin V in patients with thalassemia major and intermedia was significantly higher than that in the control group and patients with thalassemia minor. Although the mean expression was higher in patients with thalassemia intermedia than in those with thalassemia major, it was not statistically significant.The mean expression of platelets P-selectin in patients with thalassemia major and thalassemia intermedia was significantly higher than that in controls and patients with thalassemia minor. However, its expression was significantly higher in patients with thalassemia intermedia than in those with thalassemia major. Annexin V also showed a positive correlation with P-selectin, and both markers positively correlated with regularity of blood transfusion.",

We aimed to correlate coagulation activation/inhibition, thrombin generation and fibrinolysis with the development of acute trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC) and its effects on early mortality in isolated severe traumatic brain injury (iSTBI) patients.A prospective screening of iSTBI patients was done for two years. History of anticoagulants, liver disease, hypotension, extracranial injuries, transfusion, brain death were excluded. TIC was defined as international normalized ratio (INR)\u202f\u2265\u202f1.27 and/or prothrombin time (PT)\u202f\u2265\u202f16.7 seconds and/or activated partial thromboplastin Time (aPTT)\u202f\u2265\u202f28.8 seconds on admission following iSTBI. Analysis of tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), protein C (PC), protein S (PS), thrombin/antithrombin complex (TAT), soluble fibrin monomer (sFM), tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was done. Cases were categorized as presence or absence of TIC and 20 healthy controls participants were included.A total of 120 cases met the inclusion criteria, aged 35.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f12.12\u202fyears, 96% males. TIC was identified in 50 (41.6%). TIC occurred independently of age, sex, Glasgow coma scale (GCS) but was associated with acidosis (60%; p\u202f=\u202f.01). Following iSTBI significant decline was seen in coagulation activation. Thrombin generation and fibrinolysis were markedly increased. TF, TFPI, PC and PS were low in TIC compared with control. Significant depletion of PS was seen in TIC versus No-TIC. TBI patients with depleted PS had an odds ratio (OR) of 7.10 (1.61\u201331.2) for TIC. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis depicted area under the curve (AUC) of 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.63\u20130.84) with a cut-off of \u226574 of PS (specificity 63.9%, sensitivity 72.7%).

     "abstract": "Autologous stem cell transplant has been shown to prolong survival in multiple myeloma (MM). A common complication of the pre-transplant conditioning chemotherapy is severe multi-lineage cytopenias, resulting in significant transfusion requirements. Jehovah's Witnesses are members of a religious group that do not accept the transfusion of blood products. Many large transplant centers refuse to perform transplantation in Jehovah's Witnesses due to the complexity of treating cytopenic patients without blood product transfusions. However, some transplant centers that specialize in \u201cbloodless\u201d medicine and surgery have successfully transplanted in Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses without transfusion support.In order to maximize successful outcomes in this population, potential transplant candidates are treated with a variety of agents to maximize baseline hemoglobin and platelet counts. In preparation for the first two \u201cbloodless\u201d transplants for MM at our institution, we conducted a retrospective study of patients with MM who underwent a transplant in the preceding year.Of the 60 patients reviewed, only six required packed red blood cell transfusion, whereas 39 required at least one platelet transfusion. These findings helped us to design a novel protocol for a \u201cbloodless\u201d autologous transplant. We administered romiplostim, a thrombopoietin (TPO) agonist, along with aminocaproic acid, desmopressin, and vitamin K post-transplant to two Jehovah's Witness patients to mitigate the risk of thrombocytopenia. Neither patient experienced significant bleeding nor qualified for platelet transfusion, and underwent successful and uncomplicated transplantation.We propose that the use of romiplostim or similar TPO agonists can be used to maximize the chance of a successful \u201cbloodless\u201d transplant for stem cell recipients.",

     "abstract": "In recent years, tissue regeneration has become a promising field for developing stem cell-based transplantation therapies for human patients. Adult stem cells are affected by the same aging mechanisms that involve somatic cells. One of the mechanisms involved in cellular aging is hyperactivation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and disruption of 5\u2032 adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Aging of stem cells results in their impaired regenerative capacity and depletion of stem cell pools in adult tissue, which results in lower efficacy of stem cell therapy. By utilizing an effective therapeutic intervention for aged stem cells, stem cell therapy can become more promising for future application. mTORC1 inhibition is a practical approach to preserve the stem cell pool. In this article, we review the dynamic interaction between sirtuin (silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog) 1, AMPK, and mTORC1. We propose that using AMPK activators such as 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide, A769662, metformin, and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) are practical ways to be employed for achieving better optimized results in stem cell-based transplantation therapies.",

Secondary outcomes were similar between oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin in regards to global cure (66% vs. 67%, p\u202f=\u202f.508), treatment failure (28% vs. 27%, p\u202f=\u202f.571), and recurrent disease (7% vs. 5%, p\u202f=\u202f.747). In a subanalysis of individuals that developed acute graft-versus-host disease following CDI, the difference in mean onset of acute graft-versus-host disease was 21.03\u202fdays in the oral vancomycin group versus 32.88\u202fdays in the fidaxomicin group (p\u202f=\u202f.0031).The findings of this study suggest that oral vancomycin and fidaxomicin are comparable options for CDI treatment in allogeneic SCT patients within 100\u202fdays following transplant.",

Study assessments included BMQ to examine beliefs about hydroxyurea; Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) to assess hydroxyurea adherence; and Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS\u00ae) to evaluate HRQOL.Participants (41% female, 91% Black) had median age of 13.5 (IQR 12\u201318) years.

Available clinical studies have been conducted in heterogenous patient populations and with different administration protocols including stem cell sources. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics of ATG is variable, and the clinically effective dose of rATG-F, in particular, is not exactly known. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical outcomes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who underwent hemopoietic peripheral stem cell transplantation from full-matched sibling donors and given two different doses of r-ATG-F.This was a single-center, retrospective chart review conducted between July 2005 and July 2016. Sixty-nine consecutive AML patients who underwent transplant with fludarabine- and busulfan-based conditioning were included in the study. Patients in Group 1 received 15\u202fmg/kg body weight rATG-F to 2013 (n\u202f=\u202f46), and Group 2 received 30\u202fmg/kg of rATG-F dose begining in 2013 to reduce to cGVHD (n\u202f=\u202f23). Cyclosporine and methotrexate were used to treat acute GVHD (aGVHD) prophylaxis. Outcome parameters were compared between the groups.Although the recommended dose r-ATG-F had led to a decrease in the cumulative incidence of cGVHD (27 [58.7%] vs. 8 [34.8%]; p\u202f=\u202f.03), it also increased the infection rate at 1\u202fyear (3 [6.5%] vs. 4 [17.4%]; p\u202f=\u202f.02). The two groups were similar in terms of engraftment time, aGVHD, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, and rATG-F-related toxicity. A Cox regression model revealed that aGVHD III\u2013IV was associated with increased nonrelapse mortality at 1\u202fyear (hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f18.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.667\u2013199.255; p = <.02). No patients developed rATG-F-related severe adverse events (Common Terminology Criteria grade 4 or 5).Dose difference of rATG-F did not influence survival parameters; however, increasing the dose to 30\u202fmg/kg seems to be effective for reducing cGVHD with an increase in infection rate requiring close monitoring of infections in AML patients who received myeloablative fludarabine/busulfan conditioning.",

Serum was isolated from blood samples of gastric cancer patients (n\u202f=\u202f200) and controls (n\u202f=\u202f200). Following RNA extraction, reverse transcription was carried out and transcript levels of glycosyltransferases were determined using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and normalized against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression. The amount of target gene, normalized to an endogenous reference gene relative to calibrator was calculated by using \u0394\u0394CT method. Transcript levels in the serum samples of gastric cancer patients were compared with those of controls; also the same was correlated within sex and different stages of disease.The mRNA expression of ppGalNAc-T6 and ST6GalNAc-I was significantly higher in serum samples of gastric cancer patients on comparison with controls (p\u202f=\u202f.008), however, there was no significant difference in mRNA expression of GlcNAcT-V, ST3Gal I, and ST3 Gal IV in serum samples of gastric cancer patients and controls (p\u202f=\u202f.097). In addition, no significant association of mRNA expression of these glycosyltransferases was found within sex and stages in this study.This study revealed the potential of ppGalNAc-T6 and ST6GalNAc-I mRNA transcript levels in serum as markers of gastric cancer.

To our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial has been performed to date comparing myeloablative versus reduced intensity conditioning regimens in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients eligible for the procedure.

Echocardiography was done to the patient group and PH was diagnosed based on calculated mean pulmonary artery pressure [MPAP] >25\u00a0mmHg.We found that, mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD serum P-selectin level (platelet activator marker) was significantly higher in thalassemic patients (2337\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0566\u00a0pg/ml) in comparison to controls (1467\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0247\u00a0pg/ml) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

For NPM1 mutation detection, we used the pyrosequencing technique; for FLT3 mutations, polymerase chain reaction and RFLP with ECO-RV techniques were used, and for DNMT3A mutation analysis, we used Sanger sequencing and RFLP (Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism) techniques.NPM1 mutation was found in 40.80%, DNMT3A in 12.06%, and FLT3 mutation was found in 16.66% of 174 CN-AML patients. We also found seven cases which were (NPM1+, FLT3+), 10 cases which were (NPM1+, DNMT3A+), and two cases were found positive for (DNMT3A+, FLT3+) mutations. Adult patients had significantly higher frequency of NPM1 mutation than children (72.22% vs. 16.66%; p\u202f=\u202f.020), whereas FLT3/ITD and DNMT3A mutation was associated with higher white blood count (p\u202f=\u202f.081).

Ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton\u2019s tyrosine kinase, has demonstrated impressive response rates in the relapsed/refractory setting, including in the setting of Del17p and/or TP53 mutations. Venetoclax, an inhibitor of BCL-2 known to play an important role in regulating cell death, has been approved recently for treatment of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia with Del17p who have received at least one prior therapy. Unfortunately, a cure remains unattainable unless eligible patients are offered an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. However, hematopoietic cell allografting is limited by the availability of suitable donors and significant morbidity and mortality. Recent clinical practice recommendations by the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation have relegated the role of transplantation to later stages of the disease. In patients with evidence of Richter syndrome, frontline consolidation allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the most desirable approach owing to the limited activity of ibrutinib or other novel therapies. Further therapeutic advances would require enrolling these patients in large clinical trials that evaluate novel therapies alone or in combination with traditional chemotherapies or even in the setting of posttransplant consolidation/maintenance.",

We report our experience of using fixed low dose of defibrotide in patients with VOD.We retrospectively evaluated 511 patients who underwent stem cell transplant at our center from November 2007 and December 2015. All patients received ursodeoxycholic acid as VOD prophylaxis. Modified Seattle criterion was used for diagnosis and severity grading of VOD. Patients developing VOD were initially treated with furosemide and adequate analgesia. Defibrotide was started within 12 to 24 hours of diagnosis of VOD. All adult patients received defibrotide at a fixed dose of 200\u00a0mg twice daily while two children were given dose of 100\u00a0mg and 50\u00a0mg twice daily.Nine (1.7%) of our patients developed VOD. Daily dose of defibrotide ranged from 5\u00a0mg/kg/d to 20\u00a0mg/kg/d till resolution of VOD. All patients had complete resolution of VOD. None of our patients required ventilator support or dialysis. No episodes of bleeding were observed. No dose response relationship was observed between defibrotide dose and time to resolution of VOD.Low fixed dose defibrotide initiated early seems to be effective and safe in treatment of VOD. This is relevant in a resource limited setting and warrants prospective evaluation.",

     "abstract": "The hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) activity has grown significantly over the past two decades in both developing and developed countries. Many challenges arise in establishing new HCT programs in developing countries, due to scarcity of resources and manpower in expertise in HCT. While cost issues can potentially hinder establishment of new HCT programs in certain regions, the focus on quality and value should be included in the general vision of leadership before establishing an HCT program. The main challenge in most developing countries is the lack of trained/qualified personnel, enormous start-up costs for a tertiary care center, and quality maintenance. Herein, we discuss the main challenges from a cost and quality perspective which occur at initiation of a new HCT program. We give real world examples of two developing countries that have recently started new HCT programs despite significant financial constraints. We also portray recommendations from the Worldwide Network of Blood and Marrow Transplantation for levels of requirements for a new HCT program. We hope that this review will serve as a general guide for new transplant program leadership with respect to the concerns of balancing high quality with concurrently lowering costs.",

     "abstract": "More than 70,000 hematopoietic cell transplants are currently performed each year, and these continue to increase every year. However, there is a significant variation in the number of absolute transplants and transplant rates between centers, countries, and global regions. The prospect for emerging countries to develop a hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) program, as well as to decide on whether autologous HCT (auto-HCT) or allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) should be established to start with, relies heavily on factors that can explain differences between these two procedures. Major factors that will influence a decision about establishing the type of HCT program are macroeconomic factors such as organization of the healthcare network, available resources and infrastructure. Prevalence of specific diseases in the region as well genetic background of donors and recipients will also influence the mandate or priority of the HCT in the national healthcare plan to explain some of the country-specific differences. Furthermore, microeconomic factors play a role, such as center-specific experience in treating various disorders requiring hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, along with accreditation status and patient volume. The objective of the transplant procedure was to improve the survival and quality of life of patients. The regional difference that one notices in emerging countries about the higher number of allo-HCT compared with auto-HCT procedures performed is primarily based on suboptimal healthcare network in treating various malignant disorders that are the primary indication for auto-stem cell transplantation. In this context, nonmalignant disorders such as bone marrow failure syndromes, inherited genetic disorders and hemoglobinopathies have become the major indication for stem cell transplantation. Better understanding of these factors will assist in establishing new transplant centers in the emerging countries to achieve their specific objectives and positive outcome.",

Published data supports the value of quality management systems in improving post-transplant outcomes; however, there are no universally established, or agreed upon, criteria to assess adequacy of training of physicians, transplant or nontransplant, and supporting staff, among others. It is of paramount importance for transplant centers to identify the needed area(s) of expertise in order to seek appropriate training for their staff. Moreover, transplant physicians need to keep up-to-date with the rapidly occurring advances in the field. Outcomes of patients undergoing HCT are affected by various factors related to patient, disease, procedure, preventative, and supportive strategies, among others. Accordingly, availability of databases is necessary to collect information on these variables and use to benchmark future prospective clinical trials aiming at further improving clinical outcomes. Twinning with leading centers worldwide is helping to not only bridge the survival gap of patients diagnosed with cancer in the developing vis-\u00e0-vis the developed world, but eventually closing it. The advent of the World Wide Web and revolution in telecommunication has made access to information more readily available to various sectors including healthcare.

The risk of bacterial infections is mainly related to neutropenia, mucositis, and the presence of vascular lines. Most parts of the world have witnessed a shift in epidemiology toward Gram-negative bacteria; a large proportion of which are resistant to fluoroquinolones, extended-spectrum beta-lactams, carbapenems, and in some units even colistin. Meticulous infection control practices are essential for prevention of bacterial infections in HSCT. The role of routine prophylactic antibiotics is limited in settings with high rates of bacterial resistance. If used, prophylactic antibiotics should be limited to high-risk patients, and the agents are selected based on local resistance profiles. Neutropenic fever is a medical emergency in most HSCT recipients. Prompt clinical evaluation is paramount, along with the intravenous administration of appropriate empiric antimicrobials, typically an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent. Glycopeptides should only be considered if the patient is hemodynamically unstable or Gram-positive infection is suspected. Additional Gram-negative agents, such as colistin or aminoglycosides, may be added if extensive Gram-negative resistance is expected. To mitigate increasing bacterial resistance, empiric antibiotic regimens should be rationalized or discontinued as soon as possible.",

     "abstract": "Despite the refinements in molecular methods for the detection of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and the advent of highly effective preemptive strategies, CMV remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. CMV can cause tissue-invasive disease including pneumonia, hepatitis, colitis, retinitis, and encephalitis. Mortality in HCT recipients with CMV disease can be as high as 60%. CMV infection has been associated with increased risk of secondary bacterial and fungal infections, increased risk of graft-versus-host disease, and high rates of non-relapse mortality following HCT. The risk of CMV is highly dependent on the donor (D) and the recipient (R) serostatus (D\u2212/R+\u00a0>\u00a0D+/R+\u00a0>\u00a0D+/R\u2212\u00a0>\u00a0D\u2212/R\u2212). Among allogeneic HCT recipients, high-dose corticosteroids, T-cell depletion, graft-versus-host disease, and mismatched or unrelated donors constitute the main predisposing factors. However, not all seropositive individuals with these risk factors develop CMV, which strongly suggests that host factors, such as those regulating CMV-specific T-cell responses, play a major role in predisposition to CMV in HCT recipients. Here, we discuss emerging concepts in CMV infection in HCT with emphasis on immunological factors that govern CMV reactivation and the applicability of immune monitoring to understand correlates of pathogenesis and its potential to guide clinical decision making.",

Mold-active prophylaxis should be limited to the highest risk groups. Empiric antifungal therapy for HSCT with persistent febrile neutropenia is associated with unacceptable response rates, unnecessary antifungal therapy, increased risk of toxicity, and inflated costs. Empiric therapy should not be a substitute for detailed work up to identify the cause of fever in such patients. The improved diagnostic performance of serum biomarkers such as galactomannan and \u03b2-D-glucan, as well as polymerase chain reaction assays has allowed the development of diagnostic-driven antifungal therapy strategies for high risk patients. Diagnostic-driven approaches have resulted in reduced unnecessary antifungal exposure, improved diagnosis of invasive fungal disease, and reduced costs without increased risk of mortality. The appropriateness of diagnostic-driven antifungal strategy for individual HSCT centers depends on the availability and turnaround times for diagnostics, multidisciplinary expertise, and the local epidemiology of invasive fungal infections. Echinocandins are the treatment of choice for invasive candidiasis in most HSCT recipients. Fluconazole may be used for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in hemodynamically stable patients with no prior azole exposure. The primary treatment of choice for invasive aspergillosis is voriconazole. Alternatives include isavuconazole and lipid formulations of amphotericin. Currently available evidence does not support routine primary combination antifungal therapy for invasive aspergillosis. However, combination salvage antifungal therapy may be considered in selected patients.

Recent studies performed in the context of novel agent induction suggest that autologous transplantation continues to improve response rates and progression-free survival, thus underscoring its role in transplant-eligible patients. Emerging paradigms in the treatment of multiple myeloma include immune approaches, such as adoptive cellular therapies, vaccines, or antibody-based immune manipulations, all of which seem to synergize with a transplant platform.

With a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis, recently there have been major advances in the treatment of NHLs including addition of novel monoclonal antibodies, targeted therapies, and immune activators to the therapy armamentarium. Despite these remarkable developments, autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) remains not only a standard-of-care curative option for aggressive NHL but also an important therapeutic option for indolent NHL. In NHL, for patients with high-risk features, including those heavily pretreated or with refractory disease or those experiencing failure after an auto-HCT, allogeneic HCT (allo-HCT) remains the only curative option.

In DLBCL patients, we discuss the role of HCT in clinically and biologically defined ultra-high-risk disease. In FL patients, auto-HCT is best reserved for relapsed chemosensitive patients after two to three lines of prior chemoimmunotherapies, who are not candidates for allo-HCT, either because of donor unavailability, associated comorbidities, or patient preference. Reduced-intensity conditioning allo-HCT offers the curative option for patients with relapsed/refractory FL. Although the emergence of targeted, biologic, and immunological therapies is welcoming, it is currently unclear how these new therapies might enhance or replace allo-HCT.

Multiple inheritance patterns have been described in these disorders; many are transmitted in an autosomal recessive pattern, which may consequently lead to a higher prevalence of such illnesses in homogeneous societies such as Saudi Arabia, where consanguineous marriages are not uncommon. At King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, the most common entity referred for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is Fanconi anemia, followed by pure red aplasia, and, less commonly, dyskeratosis congenita, congenital neutropenia, and others. Of all the congenital bone marrow failure syndromes, two of them\u2014Fanconi anemia and dyskeratosis congenita\u2014represent a real challenge in terms of conditioning for HCT and require special attention. This minireview is a snapshot of the recent international and local experience of HCT in these two entities.",

     "abstract": "Thalassemia is the most common monogenic hematologic disease that affects millions in the world and kills thousands of patients every year.Without transfusion or transplantation, patients with thalassemia major are expected to die within months of diagnosis. However, long-term transfusion and chelation therapy is highly challenging for many developing countries where the disease is prevalent, representing a major and unsustainable health burden.Stem cell transplantation is the only cure for thalassemia. It has witnessed major developments that have made it less toxic, more successful, and feasible for a larger number of patients with diverse comorbidities and from a wider range of donors. Advances in human leukocyte antigen typing have greatly refined alternate donor selection with results of matched unrelated donors similar to matched sibling donors.Novel strategies such as haploidentical and cord blood transplantation have increased the possibility of patients with no healthy donor to get a better opportunity to survive and avoid chronic transfusion complications.Cost-effectively, transplantation should be considered the primary treatment of choice in the presence of a suitable related or unrelated donor and at centers with a satisfactory experience in the field of transplantation and particularly, in managing those with thalassemia. Despite some complications such as graft-versus-host disease and late conditioning effects, the overall improvement in the quality of life of thalassemia is difficult to deny.Unfortunately, the number of transplants for thalassemia represents only a minority of all transplants conducted globally and the essential requirement for transplants for thalassemia in limited-resources countries should mandate the transplant societies, including Worldwide Network for Blood and Marrow Transplantation, to collaborate to help initiate and support specialized transfusion and transplant programs for managing thalassemia.",

     "abstract": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) offers potentially curative therapy for many hematologic and nonhematologic conditions. As a successful outcome of Qatar\u2019s National Cancer Strategy, the HSCT program was started in the National Center for Cancer Care and Research (NCCCR) in October 2015. The HSCT program in NCCCR is the only transplant program in Qatar and self-sufficient with all three core components: the stem cell collection facility, the stem cell processing facility, and the clinical program, which are locally available at Hamad Medical Corporation. In this paper, we report on the outcomes of the first 16 patients who underwent autologous stem cell transplantations (ASCTs) in our center. A total of 17 ASCT have been performed for 16 adult (\u226514\u00a0years) patients. Thirteen of the 16 patients were eligible for disease evaluation at Day 100 post-ASCT. Among these patients, the overall response rate on Day 100 was 92% (complete remission, 61%; very good partial remission/partial remission, 31%) and stable disease occurred in 6%. The procedure was very well tolerated by all patients. At the time of writing this report, all patients are alive; however, one patient (6%) had disease relapse. The Day 100 post-ASCT nonrelapse mortality rate was 0%. Launching the HSCT program represents a historic milestone in the development of the health-care sector in Qatar. The 1st year of this program was very fruitful with the accomplishment of 17 successful transplants. We are in the process of starting the allogenic HSCT early next year. This would represent the next significant milestone for cancer care in Qatar.",

The gross national income per capita was 7327.7 RO (Omani rial; equivalent to US$19,033) in 2014. There are two hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) centers in Oman: the Sultan Qaboos University Hospital (SQUH; allogeneic and autologous) and the Royal Hospital (RH; autologous). HSCT activity in Oman started in 1995 at the SQUH center, which had only one bed, and four cases were performed in that year. The number of allogeneic HSCTs at the SQUH ranged between four and 29 cases per year, of which malignancy was the main indication for transplantation (47%). Most of the transplants were performed from identical sibling donor. T-deplete haploidentical and recently T-replete haploidentical HSCT were also performed at the SQUH center. In the allogeneic HSCT cohort transplanted at the SQUH, the risk of acute graft-versus-host disease (Grades II\u2013IV) was 18%, whereas the risk of extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease was 8%. The HSCT unit at the RH, which started in 2014, performs autologous HSCT procedures only. The number of autologous HSCT cases at the RH ranged between three and 16 cases per year. Limited bed availability is a frequent obstacle to HSCT in Oman. Construction of a much larger national HSCT center is about to be completed, which will likely improve access to transplant services in Oman.",

Health care is free and it is supported by the Ministry of Health. 16 university hospitals exist in Algeria and only two (Algiers and Oran) practicing bone marrow transplant. Adult hematologic malignancies account for 10% (about 4000 new cases/year) of the malignancy affecting in most cases young patients under 65\u00a0years of age. In 2016, 270 transplants were performed in total (Algiers\u00a0+\u00a0Oran), including 149 allografts (related donor transplants: 99%) and 121 autografts. 98% of transplants are done in adults and only 2% in children with cord blood transplants. In summary for the two transplant centers, the predominant types of transplantation performed are allogeneic transplant in 55% and autologous transplant in 45%.The particularity of EHU1st November in Oran, is the use of non-cryopreserved stem cells. Stem cell was mobilized using G-CSF alone and the grafts were kept in a conventional blood bank refrigerator at +4\u00a0\u00b0C until reinfusion on day 0. The outcome with non-cryopreserved stem cells are the same as those with cryopreserved stem cells and we conclude that autologous transplant with non cryopreserved hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is a simple, effective and safe method and the cryopreservation is not necessary in our work conditions in developing countries. The projects are achieving the autograft in all University Hospitals with non cryopreserved HSC, achieving a center allograft in the east of the country and the development of bone marrow transplantation in children.Currently in Algeria, the number of transplantation is insufficient and the development of new transplant centers is essential. In the future, we hope to implement the National Society of Bone Marrow transplant and also the National recipient registry and Donor registry in Algeria.",

     "abstract": "Relapse of Hodgkin lymphoma after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (autologous HCT) is a major therapeutic challenge. Its management, at least in younger patients, traditionally involves salvage chemotherapy aiming to achieve disease remission followed by consolidation with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allogeneic HCT) in eligible patients. The efficacy of salvage therapy is variable and newer combination chemotherapy regimens have improved the outcomes. Factors such as shorter time to relapse after autologous HCT and poor performance status have been identified as predictors of poor outcome. Newer agents such as immunoconjugate brentuximab vedotin, checkpoint inhibitors (e.g., pembrolizumab, nivolumab), lenalidomide, and everolimus are available for the treatment of patients relapsing after autologous HCT. With the availability of reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT, more patients are eligible for this therapy with lesser toxicity and better efficacy due to graft versus lymphoma effects. Alternative donor sources such as haploidentical stem cell transplantation and umbilical cord blood transplantation are expanding this procedure to patients without HLA-matched donors. However, strategies aimed at reduction of disease relapse after reduced intensity conditioning allogeneic HCT are needed to improve the outcomes of this treatment. This review summarizes the current data on salvage chemotherapy and HCT strategies used to treat patients with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma after prior autologous HCT.",

We assessed CD184 (CXCR4) using flow cytometry in the harvest cells together with post-transplant BM assessment on Day 28 and Day 90 for complete morphologic, molecular studies, and detection of CD184 expression on CD34+ cells with chimerism studies on total peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Diagnoses of the enrolled patients were as follows: seven (24.1%) with acute myeloid leukemia, eight (27.6%) with multiple myeloma, four (13.8%) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, three (10.3%) with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two (6.9%) with myelodysplastic syndromes, two (6.9%) with aplastic anemia, two (6.9%) with chronic myeloid leukemia, one (3.4%) with Hodgkin lymphoma, and one (3.4%) with plasmacytomas. One patient died and was excluded from the study because there were not enough data about engraftment. There was no statistical significance between the level of CD184 in stem cell harvest and the prediction of successful engraftment (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05) as well as in Day 28 BM sample (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), whereas there was a statistical significance between the level of CD184 in Day 90 BM sample and the occurrence of successful engraftment (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002).SDF-1/CXCR4 axis plays a crucial role in engraftment; however, more studies are warranted to assess their expression post-transplant. Evaluating the ligand (chemokine, SDF-1) or its receptor (CXCR4) may serve as potential surrogate markers for assessment of engraftment.",

Previous studies have shown that Bu at a fixed dose of 3.2\u00a0mg/kg/day (FBD) given intravenously decreases variability in drug pharmacokinetics and this decreases the dependency on therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of Bu. We compared the Bu dose given using TDM with the FBD of 3.2\u00a0mg/kg/day. Seventy-three patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplasia, chronic myeloid leukemia, thalassemia major, and sickle cell disease were included. The mean age at transplant was 15\u00a0years (range 2\u201355\u00a0years) with 57% adults. Indication for transplantation was leukemia/myelodysplastic syndrome in 46% of the patients, while the remaining 54% were transplanted for inherited blood disorders. We found that the median FBD was lower than the median TDM dose by 39\u00a0mg/day with a statistically significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) even after adjusting for the weight (median total FBD of 349\u00a0mg, median TDM dose of 494\u00a0mg, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Age and underlying condition (malignant vs. nonmalignant) were the main factors affecting Bu clearance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 and p\u00a0<\u00a00.07, respectively). TDM remains an important tool for the appropriate dosing of Bu in preparative regimens of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, especially in populations with genetic admixture.",

     "abstract": "A decision about the need for antimicrobial therapy in a patient with febrile neutropenia after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is often complicated because of the low frequency of culture isolation and reduced clinical manifestation of infection. Usefulness and choice of sepsis biomarkers to distinguish bloodstream infection (BSI) from other causes of febrile episode is still argued in HSCT recipients in modern epidemiological situations characterized by the emergence of highly resistant gram-negative microorganisms. In this study a comparative analysis of diagnostic values of presepsin, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) was performed as sepsis biomarkers in adult patients after HSCT in a condition of high prevalence of gram-negative pathogens.A prospective observational clinical study was performed at the Center of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation in Minsk, Republic of Belarus. The biomarkers (presepsin, PCT, and CRP) were assessed in a 4-hour period after the onset of febrile neutropenia episode in adult patients after HSCT. Microbiologically-confirmed BSI caused by a gram-negative pathogen was set as a primary outcome.Clinical and laboratory data were analyzed in 52 neutropenic patients after HSCT aged 18\u201379\u00a0years. Out of the biomarkers assessed, the best diagnostic value was shown in presepsin (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.889, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.644\u20130.987, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) with 75% sensitivity and 100% specificity, then in PCT (AUC: 0.741, 95% CI: 0.573\u20130.869, p\u00a0=\u00a0.0037) with 62% sensitivity and 88% specificity. The optimal cut-off value for CRP was set as 165\u00a0mg/L, while it had an average diagnostic value (AUC: 0.707, 95% CI: 0.564\u20130.825, p\u00a0=\u00a0.0049) with low sensitivity (40%) and should not be routinely recommended as a biomarker in adult patients with suspected BSI after HSCT.Presepsin may be recommended in adult patients with suspected gram-negative BSI after HSCT as a possible additional supplementary test with a cut-off value of 218\u00a0pg/mL. PCT is inferior to presepsin in terms of sensitivity and specificity, but still shows a good quality of diagnostic value with an optimal cut-off value of 1.5\u00a0ng/mL.

The main clinical manifestation of MPN-MF is splenomegaly secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). The effects of HSCT on splenic EMH and associated vascular and stromal changes are unknown. This study compares the findings seen in spleens following HSCT with those of nontransplanted patients, normal controls, and matched bone marrow (BM) samples.This study included three transplanted MPN-MF spleens, three nontransplanted MPN-MF spleens, and three normal controls. Spleens were assessed for: (a) presence/extent of EMH; (b) presence of Gamna\u2013Gandy bodies; (c) splenic fibrosis; (d) CD34-positive microvessel density; (e) CD8-positive sinusoids; (f) frequency of smooth muscle actin-positive myoid cells; and (g) nerve growth factor receptor-positive adventitial reticulum cells. In two cases, matched BM samples were assessed for cellularity, presence of atypical megakaryocytes, and fibrosis.Compared with normal controls, all MPN-MF spleens were larger in size, had EMH, red pulp fibrosis, higher CD34-positive microvessel density, and decreased CD8-positive sinusoids. Compared with nontransplanted cases, post-HSCT spleens showed disappearance or reduction of EMH. Gamna\u2013Gandy bodies were increased; no differences in the remaining parameters were found. A reduction of splenic EMH was associated with normalization of BM cellularity and megakaryopoiesis.HSCT reduces/abrogates splenic EMH and is associated with an increased number of Gamna\u2013Gandy bodies, which may suggest vascular damage. The lack of stromal changes in spleens removed shortly after transplant is in line with similar observations in the BM, where a longer interval is often necessary for resolution of fibrosis.",

Our study aimed to describe the incidence of CMV reactivation and burden of disease, as well as the tolerability of an intensive prevention strategy as compared to historical prevention.This was a retrospective chart review of 33 CMV seropositive patients that underwent UCBT. The intensive prevention strategy in UCBT consisted of ganciclovir 5\u00a0mg/kg/d intravenously or valganciclovir 900\u00a0mg by mouth daily initiated at the beginning of the conditioning regimen until Day \u22122.

Historical standard prevention was acyclovir 800\u00a0mg by mouth twice daily initiated at the beginning of the conditioning regimen until Day +365.Thirty-three patients were included from 2008 to 2014. There were no differences in the adverse effects experienced between the two regimens (p\u00a0=\u00a0.4). CMV reactivation occurred significantly later with intensive prevention (p\u00a0=\u00a0.003). The median CMV viral titer at reactivation was lower in the intensive versus the historic prevention (1,800\u00a0copies/mL and 2,700\u00a0copies/mL, respectively), but was not significantly different.

Previously, we established embryonic stem (ES) cells (tet-226aa/N6-Ainv18) that secrete human factor VIII (hFVIII) by introducing the human F8 gene in mouse Ainv18 ES cells. Here, we explored the potential of cell transplantation therapy for hemophilia A using the ES cells. Transplant tet-226aa/N6-Ainv18 ES cells were injected into the spleens of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-pretreated wild-type mice, and CCl4-pretreated hemophilia A mice. F8 expression was induced by doxycycline in drinking water, and hFVIII-antigen production was assessed in all cell transplantation experiments. Injecting the ES cells into SCID mice resulted in an enhanced expression of the hFVIII antigen; however, teratoma generation was confirmed in the spleen. Transplantation of ES cells into wild-type mice after CCl4-induced liver injury facilitated survival and engraftment of transplanted cells without teratoma formation, resulting in hFVIII production in the plasma. Although CCl4 was lethal to most hemophilia A mice, therapeutic levels of FVIII activity, as well as the hFVIII antigen, were detected in surviving hemophilia A mice after cell transplantation. Immunolocalization results for hFVIII suggested that transplanted ES cells might be engrafted at the periportal area in the liver. Although the development of a safer induction method for liver regeneration is required, our results suggested the potential for developing an effective ES-cell transplantation therapeutic model for treating hemophilia A in the future.",

Wherever possible, follow-up plasma samples post three cycles of chemotherapy were obtained.Over a period of 10\u00a0months, 33 newly diagnosed adult-onset HL were enrolled in the study. Pretherapy plasma EBV DNA was detectable in \u223c49% (16/33) patients (viral loads range, 1.0\u201351.2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103\u00a0copies/mL) and undetectable in 30 voluntary blood donors. LMP1 IHC was positive in 56% of cases tested (14/25). Sensitivity and specificity of plasma EBV DNA with respect to LMP1 IHC were 86% and 100%, respectively. Of the eight patients in whom follow-up plasma was available, in five EBV baseline-positive patients EBV load reverted to negative postchemotherapy and corroborated with clinical remission.Plasma EBV DNA load estimation may be useful in detecting EBV-association and possibly monitoring the response to therapy in EBV-related HL especially in our country where EBV association of HL is higher than in developed nations.",

     "abstract": "The Eastern Mediterranean Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EMBMT) group has accumulated over 31\u00a0years of data and experience in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), particularly in hemoglobinopathies, severe aplastic anemia, inherited metabolic and immune disorders, in addition to a wide array of hematologic malignancies unique to this region. A regional update in current HSCT trends is highly warranted. We studied the trends of HSCT activities in World Health Organization-Eastern Mediterranean (EMRO) region, surveyed by the EMBMT, between 2011 and 2012.Retrospective analysis of the survey data mainly of cumulative number of transplants, types of transplants (autologous vs. allogeneic), types of conditioning such as myeloablative versus reduced intensity was conducted. Also, trends in leukemias, hemoglobinopathies, severe aplastic anemia, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, amongst others were analyzed.Twenty-one teams from nine EMRO countries reported their data (100% return rate) to the EMBMT for the years 2011\u20132012, with a total of 3,546 first HSCT (1,670 in 2011; 1,876 in 2012). Allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT) represented the majority (62%) in both years. The main indications for allo-HSCT were acute leukemias (988; 46%), bone marrow failure syndromes (421, 20%), hemoglobinopathies (242; 11%), and immune deficiencies (157; 7%). There was a progressive increase in the proportions of chronic myeloid leukemia cases transplanted beyond first chronic phase (37 [7%] of all chronic myeloid leukemia cases in 2011 vs. 39 [29%] in 2012). The main indications for autologous transplants were multiple myeloma/plasma cell disorders (510; 39%), Hodgkin lymphoma (311; 24%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (259; 20%), and solid tumors (163; 12%). Reduced intensity conditioning continued to show a progressive decrease over years (9.5% in 2011 vs. 7.9% in 2012), yet remained relatively low compared with contemporary practices in Europe published by EBMT. The vast majority (91%) of allo-HSCT source was from sibling donors with continued dominance of peripheral blood (64%) followed by bone marrow (33%).While umbilical cord blood transplants increased to 4% of allo-HSCT, matched unrelated donor remained underutilized and there was no haplo-identical transplant reported. Large centers with >50 HSCT/year, showed a continued increase in the total number of allo-HSCT over the past 2\u00a0years that may be related to capacity building issues and require further studies.There is a discernable increase of HSCT rate in the EMRO region with a significant expansion in utilization of cord blood transplants and allogeneic peripheral blood-HSCT as a valuable source. However, further research of outcome data and the development of regional donor banks (cord blood and matched unrelated donors) may help to facilitate future planning to satisfy the escalating regional needs and augment collaboration within the EMBMT and globally.",

Recovered Candida isolates were speciated and antifungal susceptibility testing was performed as per Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guideline (CLSI) guidelines M44-A. Further analysis was done for potential risk factors and compared between culture positive and negative patients.Of 150 patients recruited, the majority (n\u00a0=\u00a027) were between 51 and 60\u00a0years and the male to female ratio was 1.63:1. Fifteen patients (10%) were culture positive. The culture positivity was significantly higher in acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) than in non-ALL patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). There was significant association of candidaemia with leucopenia, chemotherapeutic drugs, corticosteroids and presence of indwelling devices. Duration of disease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032) and duration of hospitalization (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) were significantly prolonged in culture positive patients. C. tropicalis was the commonest isolate (46.67%), with non- Candida albicans outnumbering C. albicans in all categories of hematological malignancies (2.75:1). All isolates of C. albicans were uniformly sensitive to all the azoles, but only 50% were sensitive to amphotericin B and none to nystatin and flucytosine.This observational study identifies ALL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) as the forms of hematological malignancy predominantly associated with candidemia; specifies risk factors and chemotherapeutic agents predisposing patients towards its occurrence; reports a preponderance of C. tropicalis among the causative agents and finds voriconazole to be the most effective antifungal agent against the recovered isolates. This information could assist in tailoring prophylactic and therapeutic antifungal practices for this infection, according to local epidemiological and mycological characteristics.",

Deletion/insertion mutations in exon 12 of NPM1 (NPM1-DIM), commonly found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), alter the C-terminal amino acids and disrupt the normal nucleocytoplasmic shuttling function of the protein, which in turn leads to disease pathogenesis. However, this altered function as a result of NPM1-DIM positivity is actually associated with a significantly better response to therapy and overall survival, and thus it is of clinical relevance to investigate the mutation status at diagnosis. Our objective was to design a reliable flow cytometry assay to detect mutated NPM1 in peripheral blood (PB) samples from AML patients, using a polyclonal mutation-specific antibody.A commercially available NPM1 mutation-specific polyclonal antibody in combination with a secondary goat antirabbit antibody was used to detect the C-terminal-mutated NPM1 by flow cytometry. OCI/AML3 (+) cell line and clinical PB controls were used to optimize the assay and determine sensitivity, reliability, and reproducibility parameters. The assay was then tested on a small cohort of 12 AML patients at diagnosis and compared with NPM1-DIM testing on a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform.Flow cytometry using the polyclonal antibody was able to reliably detect mutated NPM1 populations of at least 10%. Using an objective analysis of the mean fluorescent intensity, clear positive and negative mutated cell populations could be distinguished using the clinical AML samples. From the analysis of 12 patients, 2 were found to be positive using this assay, which corresponded with conventional PCR methodology.Flow cytometry may be used to detect NPM1 C-terminal mutations in AML patients using a polyclonal anti-NPM1 antibody, allowing rapid mutation status determination at diagnosis.",

We thus evaluated the long-term results of treatment with HDC and AHCT in MBC at our institution.From 1984 to 2000, 285 patients underwent AHCT for MBC. The patient characteristics were collected through the Cleveland Clinic, United Transplant Database. A retrospective review of the medical records of the long-term surviving breast-cancer patients treated with HDC and AHCT was conducted.With a median follow-up of 169\u00a0months, 34 (12%) remain alive. Of the 251 patients who died, 218 (87%) died of metastatic disease. A comparison by age (<50\u00a0years and >50\u00a0years) and hormonal status did not demonstrate any differences in relapse (p\u00a0=\u00a0.33 and p\u00a0=\u00a0.32, respectively) or survival (p\u00a0=\u00a0.13 and p\u00a0=\u00a0.42). Of the 34 long-term survivors, sufficient data were available on 28 patients, and further evaluation revealed that the majority had a primary or locally recurrent oligometastatic disease.This retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent AHCT for MBC demonstrates long-term survival in a small subset of patients, primarily those with primary or recurrent oligometastatic disease. Oligometastatic breast cancer is a distinct entity within MBC, which may be curable with multimodality therapy. We thus conclude there remains no overall-survival benefit to HDC in MBC.",

The FICTION technique, which uses CD138 and dual color, and the break-apart 14q32 rearrangement probe, was performed on archived smears of BM slides for 50 MM patients at the time of diagnosis.A significantly higher percentage of cases were positive for 14q32 rearrangement by FICTION (32%) compared to fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) (12%) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Cases positive by FICTION for the rearrangement were designated as Group A, while negative cases were designated as Group B. Significantly lower Hb and CRP levels were found among Group B when compared to Group A patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and 0.01, respectively). Serum albumin level and Bence Jones protein (BJP) significantly affect overall survival (OS) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, 0.007, respectively). However, a statistically non-significant shorter mean survival time was found in positive cases through FICTION versus negative cases.FICTION technique provides a sensitive tool for establishing clonal plasma cells (PC) infiltration of BM aspirates, and is amenable for use on archived as well as fresh smears.",

The mutation in the ECGF1 gene causes severe deficiency of thymidine phosphorylase (TP), which in turn increases thymidine and deoxyuridine in the blood, serum, and tissue. The toxic levels of these products cause malfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and mitochondrial DNA. Commonly, patients become symptomatic between 15 and 20\u00a0years of age (range 5\u00a0months to 35\u00a0years). The most commonly affected systems are gastrointestinal, followed by ocular, and nervous system. The disease is often fatal; high mortality rate is reported between 20 and 40\u00a0years of age. Treatment modalities that can increase thymidine phosphorylase activity and decrease thymidine and deoxy-uridine have shown symptomatic improvements in patients with MNGIE. Platelet transfusion, hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have been tried. The survival and long-term benefits of these measures are still not clear. Engrafted patients after stem cell transplantation have showed improvements in serum thymidine and deoxyuridine. We are reporting a case of MNGIE from Saudi Arabia, who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. No MNGIE case has been previously reported from Saudi Arabia or the Gulf Arab countries. From the available literature, so far only 11 patients with MNGIE have undergone stem cell transplantation.",

Idiopathic PAP occurs as a result of auto-antibodies directed against granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) impeding the surfactant clearing function of alveolar macrophages leading to progressive respiratory failure. Whole lung lavage and GM-CSF therapy has improved outcomes in patients with idiopathic PAP. Despite major advancement in the management of hematologic malignancy and its complications, little is known about the type of PAP first described by Levinson and now known as secondary PAP; a term also used when PAP occurs due to other causes such as occupational dusts.

We examine the case of a young adult who presented with a cerebellar mass.A 19-year-old boy presented with signs of raised intracranial tension, which, on imaging, revealed a right cerebellar mass. He underwent suboccipital craniotomy and partial excision of the tumor. However, the histopathology was inconclusive. He subsequently presented with cerebellar signs and repeat imaging showed recurrence of the cerebellar lesion. He underwent decompression and ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunting. Histopathology was suggestive of ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The patient was started on chemotherapy. However, his neurological status deteriorated, his condition worsened, and he expired a month later.",

Before HSCT, patients underwent liver biopsy to determine fibrosis stage based on the Lucarelli classification. Hepatic and myocardial T2\u2217 values before and 6\u00a0months after transplantation were measured and analyzed.There was not a statistically significant increase in myocardial T2\u2217 values after HSCT (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.35). Hepatic T2\u2217 values significantly decreased after HSCT (p-value <0.001), showing the liver status has been worsened. In subgroup analysis, post-HSCT hepatic T2\u2217 values (adjusted for baseline values) were significantly higher in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) compared to non-GvHD patients (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.04).The issue of iron overload is still remained as the main problem in ex-thalassemic patients after HSCT.

We compared these to 22 healthy controls and their parents. Patients and controls were subjected to clinical assessments, the symptoms checklist of the International Classification of Disease ICD (ICD-10), and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children The parents of patients and controls underwent a general health questionnaire, the ICD-10 symptoms checklist, rating scales for anxiety and depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) assessment scale, and the physical cognitive affective social economic ego problems (PCASEE) questionnaire for quality of life (QOL) rating.Psychiatric morbidity was evident in nearly 60% of leukemic children and their parents and was significantly increased in comparison to controls. Children mostly suffered from adjustment and oppositional defiant disorders. The most common discriminators between patient groups were conduct and attention problems being lowest in newly diagnosed patients, and social aggression being lowest in patients in remission. The three parameters were highest in relapsed patients whose parents mostly had adjustment and depressive disorders. Risk factors for child psychopathology were older age, female gender, and parental psychopathology. Mothers and parents with lower education and professional level were found to be vulnerable. Performance and total intelligence quotient (IQ) were significantly lower in leukemic children, and these were most pronounced in the survivor group. Risk factors for cognitive dysfunction were younger age, longer chemotherapy duration, and lower parental education level.Most patients and their caregivers suffered from significant psychiatric morbidity, highlighting the need for routine screening to improve psychological outcomes in such cases.",

Statistical analyses were conducted using descriptive statistics, the Poisson regression model, a simple linear regression model and analysis of variance with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 (SPSS).A total of 1739 cases were registered in the SCR between January 2001 and December 2008.

In an attempt to discover peptides that bind specifically to cells in the early chronic phase of the disease, we used phage-display technology to identify heptapeptides that bind specifically to the surface of BCR/ABL-expressing fibroblasts.An in vitro system using NIH3T3 stably transfected with pGD210 (BCR/ABL) was used as a model for the chronic phase of the disease. The cells were panned using a linear heptapeptide phage library (Ph.D 7.0) in a negative/positive panning strategy with NIH3T3 containing only the plasmid vector as the wild type control.We identified four novel peptides that were enriched through this technique. These peptides contained either multiple proline residues or serine/threonine\u2013proline pairs and showed a confirmed binding preference for BCR/ABL+ fibroblasts. The peptide Y-R-A-P-W-P-P also showed a binding affinity for granulocytes from untreated CML patients.We have identified several novel peptides that can be used in future studies to identify specific CML cell-surface antigens or provide a novel drug-delivery mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Pediatric patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) are at a uniquely high risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infections. The pre-emptive treatment model whereby asymptomatic post-transplant patients are routinely screened with treatment initiated if found viremic has recently been shown to be superior in terms of patient mortality when compared to deferring laboratory assessment and treatment until symptoms emerge. This study analyzes the cost-effectiveness of the pre-emptive therapy model in patient care dollars per quality-adjusted life years (QALY).Utilization and outcome data were compiled as a retrospective cohort study of 96 pediatric patients receiving HSCT at University of California Los Angeles Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Department between the years 2006 and 2010. Two-decision tree models were constructed for each the pre-emptive model and the deferred model wherein costs and probability assumptions were based on either previously published literature or calculated from this study cohort.The pre-emptive model resulted in a five-year survival of 71%, during which time 4% of patients were found to be EBV viremic, while 33% were found to be CMV viremic. The average actual cost of EBV/CMV virology screening per patient in the cohort following the pre-emptive model was $9699 while the expected cost following the deferred model was $19,284. This results in an incremental cost effectiveness ratio illustrating pre-emptive model cost-savings of $2367/QALY.These results support the financial viability and prudence of scheduled screening for subclinical viremia for achieving optimal outcomes in a cost-effective manner in the pediatric HSCT population.",

The purpose of this work was to evaluate BM-MSC role regarding the viability, proliferation and immunophenotype of normal B-cell precursors from control (Ct) patients and leukaemic cells from B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL) patients.BM-MSC were isolated and characterised from voluntary donors. Mononuclear cells isolated from Ct and B-ALL bone marrow samples were cultured in the presence or absence of BM-MSC for 7\u00a0days. Cell viability was determined with LIVE/DEAD and proliferation index evaluated by CFSE labelling. Cell population immunophenotypes were characterised by estimating CD19, CD10, CD20 and CD45 antigens by flow cytometry.After co-culture, B-ALL cells exhibited higher viability (20\u201340%) as compared to just cells (3\u201310%). Ct and B-ALL absolute cell counts were higher in the presence of BM-MSC (Ct: 25/mm3\u00a0cf\u00a08/mm3, B-ALL: 15/mm3\u00a0cf\u00a03/mm3). Normal B-cell subpopulations in co-culture had increased expression of CD19 and CD10 (Pre-pre B) and CD45 and CD20 antigens (Pre-B). B-ALL cells co-cultured with BM-MSC showed an increase in CD19 and CD20, although the greatest increase was observed in the CD10 antigen.Lymphoid cell maintenance, at early stages of differentiation, was significantly promoted by BM-MSC in normal and leukaemic cells. Co-cultures also modulated the expression of antigens associated with the B-ALL asynchronous phenotype as CD10 co-expressed with CD19 and CD20. To our knowledge, this is the first time that CD10, CD19 and CD20 leukaemic antigens have been reported as being regulated by BM-MSC.",

This could imply that the immune system could be utilized to generate immune based therapy. The aim of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of studying this further by analysing the interaction of dendritic cells with T-cells in a small cohort of MDS patients.Dendritic cells were generated in 6 MDS patients and 9 controls by culturing monocytes with GM-CSF and IL-4. After activation with LPS and TNF\u03b1, the dendritic cells were analyzed for expression of co-stimulatory and activation antigens. Thereafter, they were co-cultured with T-cells and the T-cell response was examined by measuring the % change in expression of the activation antigen CD69.MDS MoDC had reduced expression of HLA-DR (p=0.006), CD11c (p=0.0004), CD80 (p=0.03) and CD86 (p=0.003), while resting T-cells from MDS patients had higher expression of the activation antigen CD69 on all subsets. The % change in CD69 expression increased significantly for both the control and MDS T-cells after co-culture with allogeneic dendritic cells, however this change was lower in the MDS group. Despite the increased CD69 expression prior to culture, MDS MoDC significantly up-regulated CD69 expression on autologous T-cells to values that were statistically higher than control cells.This initial study suggests that the T-cells in MDS are able to respond to dendritic cells and are therefore probably not part of the malignant clone. It further implies that the dendritic cell population could be capable of presenting antigen and initiating an immune response and therefore further study is both feasible and warranted.",

     "abstract": "Thyroid cancer is the second most common malignancy among females at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre (KFSH&RC) and in Saudi Arabia, accounting for about 11% of all newly diagnosed female cancers in the country in 2008. Over the past several decades, an increasing incidence of thyroid cancer has been reported in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There are no comprehensive clinical epidemiological data for the trends of thyroid cancer incidence compared to the global incidence. This report reviews the thyroid cancer incidence in KFSH&RC and compares that with Saudi Arabia, the Gulf region, North America and globally from 2000 to 2010.Retrospective review of patients with thyroid cancer was carried out from 2000 to 2010, using the hospital Tumor Registry program as per the American College of Surgeons standards. Trends and patterns of all well-known prognostic factors were sub-stratified by age, stage and grade.A total of 2292 patients with thyroid cancer were treated at KFSH&RC, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, from 2000 to 2010. Thyroid cancer constitutes about 9% of all malignancies and 12% of all female malignancies at KFSH&RC, which are significantly higher compared to the USA, where thyroid cancer represents only 2.9% of all malignancies and 4.6% of all female malignancies. Papillary adenocarcinoma was the most common histological subtype followed by papillary carcinoma, follicular variant. Median age at diagnosis was 40 for females and 44\u00a0years for males. Overall Age-Standardized Incidence Rate (ASR) was 4.4/100,000 (6.8 for female and 2/100,000 for males) in the Kingdom in 2008. Median age at diagnosis was 38\u00a0years and the highest incidence was in the 30\u201339\u00a0year age group in KFSH&RC. About 48% of patients presented in the localized stage and 60% underwent combined modality treatment consisting of surgery, radiation and hormonal therapy. There was significantly increased incidence among females as compared to males. The age-adjusted thyroid cancer incidence rates from 2000 to 2010 varied three-fold more for females than for males. Considerable geographical variations were present in thyroid cancer incidence in Saudi Arabia.Thyroid cancer incidence rates have increased exponentially between 2000 and 2010 and there is significant geographical variation in the incidence of thyroid cancer throughout the Kingdom. Thyroid cancer has become the second most common cancer among young Saudi women with a male to female ratio at 0.3:1. Rising incidence of thyroid cancer in Saudi Arabia may be due to the increased detection and diagnosis of the thyroid cancers and not only an increase in the true occurrence of thyroid cancer. More studies are required to determine this significant difference at the molecular level.",

In 10 samples, MNCs from each sample were divided into four groups to test the effect of negative immunodepletion (NI) alone (group A); NI plus basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) supplementation together (group B); bFGF supplementation alone (group C); and culture with neither NI nor bFGF (group D).The cells of each group were isolated from 10\u00a0mL of umbilical cord blood. For investigating the effect of sample volume (group E) and MesenCult Proliferation Kits (group F), cells were isolated from 45\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02\u00a0ml. MSCs were identified on the basis of morphological, flow cytometric and differentiation potential characteristics.In groups of A\u2013D, one week after the initial seeding, the cells showed a rounded appearance, and in the fourth week, many of them died. MSCs outgrowth was seen in 40% of the samples from group F, and this yield was further enhanced to 60% in cultures done with the MesenCult Proliferation Kit (group F).

Those who underwent HSCT were significantly older (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and had a higher leukocyte count at diagnosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.53). After a median follow up of 42.2\u00a0months (range 12.7\u2013107), the estimated 5\u00a0year event free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 75% and 91.6%, respectively, for those who underwent HSCT as primary therapy and 49.3% and 83.3%, respectively, for those treated with chemotherapy plus imatinib. There was no significant difference in EFS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.98) or OS (P\u00a0=\u00a01) between the two treatment modalities.Our results indicate that chemotherapy plus TKI may be a reasonable treatment option for some children with Ph+ ALL.",

Identification of molecular targets on cancer cells has led to the design of novel drugs, which either used as single agents or in combination with chemotherapy, has prolonged survival in metastatic disease, or contributed to curative treatment in the adjuvant setting. A literature review was conducted to identify and present current knowledge on the molecular function of the HER2 receptor, its role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and anti-HER2 targeted drugs in use or under development. Many molecular targets have been identified in breast cancer, with the HER family of receptors being the ones most extensively studied. Trastuzumab and lapatinib target the HER2 receptor and are approved drugs for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. Several other targeted agents, including T-DM1, pertuzumab, neratinib, afatinib and ertumaxomab, are currently being tested in vivo as well as in clinical studies. The use of targeted therapies in metastatic breast cancer has improved prognosis, increased survival and dramatically changed the way we treat breast cancer patients today.",

After undergoing induction and consolidation chemotherapy, the patient achieved complete remission of AML with the persistence of CLL. Allogeneic transplantation was pursued given his unfavorable cytogenetics. Subsequent matched unrelated donor allogeneic stem cell transplantation resulted in full engraftment and complete remission, with no evidence of AML or CLL. Due to a scarcity of reported cases, insight into treatment and prognosis in cases of concurrent AML and CLL is limited. However, prognosis seems dependent on the chemosensitivity of AML. CLL did not have a detrimental effect on treatment or transplant outcome in our case. This is the first reported case of concomitant de novo AML and CLL to undergo allogeneic transplantation.

In a multivariate analysis independent risk factors for monitoring were inadequate surgical treatment and absence of adjuvant treatment.Myometrial invasion and mitotic index appear to be important prognostic factors. The reference surgery is hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy. Lymph node dissection does not appear to provide a benefit. Finally adjuvant treatment may carry a significant survival benefit.",

Therefore, we conducted this randomized trial, comparing two treatment groups consisting of a combination chemotherapy regimen of two different intensities followed by involved-field radiation therapy at two different dose levels.Prospective, randomized, in patients referred to the Department of Clinical Oncology and Nuclear Medicine.Ninety-eight patients with histologically proven early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma with a favorable prognosis were enrolled in this study between January 2008 and June 2010. They were randomly assigned in one of two treatment arms: arm I received four cycles of ABVD (Adriamycin, belomycin, vinblastine, dacarbazine) followed by 30\u00a0Gy of involved-field radiation therapy; arm II received two cycles of ABVD followed by 20\u00a0Gy of involved-field radiation therapy.During the follow-up period, the 2-year relapse free survival rates were 96% and 95% in arm I and arm II, respectively(P=\u00a0.8), while the 2-year overall survival rates were 98% and 95% in arm I and arm II, respectively (P=\u00a0.16). Acute toxicity affected 54% of patients treated with four cycles of ABVD, who had grade III or IV toxicity, as compared with 30% of those receiving two cycles (P<\u00a0.02). The rates of acute toxicity (grade III or IV) were also higher among patients treated with 30\u00a0Gy of involved-field radiation therapy than among those receiving 20\u00a0Gy (16% vs. 2.5%, P<\u00a0.03).In patients with early-stage Hodgkin lymphoma and a favorable prognosis, treatment with two cycles of ABVD followed by 20\u00a0Gy of involved-field radiation therapy was as effective as, and less toxic than, four cycles of ABVD followed by 30\u00a0Gy of involved-field radiation therapy.",

Secondary endpoints included duration of response, time to progression, one-year survival probability, and toxicity.A single-arm, open-label, phase 2 study conducted at 17 investigative sites in Egypt.Treatment consisted of gemcitabine (1250\u00a0mg/m2) on Days 1 and 8 and cisplatin (70\u00a0mg/m2) on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or a maximum of 6 cycles.Of 144 patients all were evaluable for safety and 132 patients were evaluable for efficacy. The overall response rate was 33.3% and 45.5% of the patients with stable disease as their best response. The median time to progression was 5.1 months and the one-year survival probability was 73%.

Using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA), their sera were tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C core antigen (anti-HBc), and HCV antibody (HCV Ab). The positive HCV Ab results were confirmed by second generation recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA).The study sample consisted of 111 males and 89 females, with a median age of 13 years. Eighty-one (40.5%) patients were HCV Ab positive by ELISA and 39 (19.5) were anti-HCV positive By RIBA; 58 (29.0%) were HBsAg positive and 13 (6.5%) were anti-HBc positive. Older age, an increased number of transfusion units, and HBsAg seropositivity were significantly associated with a higher prevalence of HCV and HBV.The prevalence of HCV and HBV infections are very high among Egyptian b-thalassemic patients, which calls for a critical look into the prevailing transfusion practices and adoption of stricter donor selection criteria to decrease the incidence rate of both HCV and HBV infections effectively. Furthermore, there is a compressing need for the use of more specific and sensitive methods for HCV testing in Mansoura University Hospitals.",

Secondary goals were to study trends of referral of AML cases from various regions to specific centers to assess the needs for health infrastructure and change of current practices.Retrospective analysis of nationwide survey of all adult cases of AML (>\u00a016\u00a0years) diagnosed between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010.A survey form was distributed to all departments of hematology at the 15 participating centers.The 1426 cases of AML diagnosed during the study period represented an annual incidence of 0.91/100 000 persons with a male to female (M/F) ratio of 1:16 and a median age of 45 years (range, 16-82\u00a0years). Nationally, 20% of cases AML were diagnosed in the whole western region of the country, 47% in the central and 33% in the east. There was a trend of continuous increase in the rate with age and in the rate of diagnosis over the last 5 years. The most common subtype was M2, followed by M4 and M5.An overall increase in the number of AML patients diagnosed nationwide over the last five years indicates a need for additional health care resources including curative and therapy-intense strategies, such as stem cell transplant facilities to optimize outcome.

We performed an extensive PubMed database search on 20 April 2011. Nineteen studies, including 759 patients, formed the basis of this systematic review.PET/ PET-CT is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting nodal metastases in patients with cervical cancer and has been shown to impact external-beam radiotherapy planning by modifying the treatment field and customizing the radiation dose. This particularly applies to detection of previously uncovered paraaortic and inguinal nodal metastases. Furthermore, PET/ PET-CT guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) allows delivery of higher doses of radiation to the primary tumor, if brachytherapy is unsuitable, and to grossly involved nodal disease while minimizing treatment-related toxicity. PET/ PET-CT based brachytherapy optimization allows improved tumor-volume dose distribution and detailed 3D dosimetric evaluation of risk organs. Sequential PET/ PET-CT imaging performed during the course of brachytherapy form the basis of \u201cadaptive\u201d brachytherapy in cervical cancer.This review demonstrates the effectiveness of pretreatment PET/ PET-CT in cervical cancer patients treated by radiotherapy.

All patients underwent craniotomy. Eighty-two patients were treated with radiotherapy and temozolomide, of whom 42 patients received temozolomide concurrent with radiation followed by adjuvant temozolomide; 40 patients received irradiation followed sequentially by 6 cycles of temozolomide. In 40 patients irradiation was utilized as a single modality treatment adjuvant to surgery. The follow-up ranged from 1 to 56 months (median, 9.4\u00a0months). The median survival for the whole cohort was 10.2\u00a0months. The median survival for the radiotherapy-alone group was 5.3\u00a0months and for combined radiotherapy/temozolomide was 14.8\u00a0months. Survival was similar in both concurrent and sequential groups. Temozolomide conferred a statistically significant survival benefit of 9 months compared with standard therapeutic modalities.The results compare favorably to those reported in developed nations. Current management of GBM in developing countries should include maximal surgical resection followed by radiotherapy/temozolomide whenever medically and/or financially feasible. Outcomes comparable to those obtained within the context of randomized trials can be expected in low-income settings if healthcare delivery is carefully planned. Our results indicate that concurrent and sequential regimens are equally effective in these patients.",

We present a detailed epidemiological analysis of retinoblastoma in Jordan in an attempt to aid national and regional strategies for improved cancer surveillance and control.Retrospective review of retinoblastoma cases presenting to the sole and exclusive ocular oncology referral center in Jordan.Forty children (59 eyes) presenting with clinically and/or histologically confirmed retinoblastomas were treated at King Hussein Cancer Center (Amman, Jordan) between January 2006 and December 2010. This case series included 28 boys and 12 girls. Data relating to age at diagnosis, laterality, gender, treatment modality and survival were recorded.The mean age-adjusted incidence of retinoblastoma in Jordan was 9.32 cases per million children per year for children aged 0-5 years. The male: female ratio was 2.3:1. Bilateral cases were encountered in 19 patients (47.5%) while 21 patients (52.5%) harbored unilateral retinoblastoma. At the time of follow-up, 38 patients (95%) were alive. Overall, 40 eyes (67.8%) were successfully preserved without the need for enucleation.The national epidemiological data gathered in this study indicates that the incidence of retinoblastoma in Jordan is similar to that reported in various countries of the world. Jordanian boys, however, are at significantly higher risk for developing retinoblastoma than age-matched girls. Furthermore, Jordanian patients are more likely to harbor bilateral retinoblastoma.",

The aim of the current study was to evaluate in vitro the antitumor efficacy of arsenic trioxide in combination with conventional chemotherapy, as proposed by the concept of \u201cdifferentiation therapy\u201d in anticancer research.Cancer stem cells showed enhanced chemoresistance to cancer drugs (carboplatin and doxorubicin) and had the ability to exclude rhodamine 123 dye, proving the existence of the multidrug resistance efflux pump. Arsenic trioxide was added prior to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor or to a slightly modified Piaf regimen with capecitabine replacing 5-fluorouracil. We also compared both cancer and normal stem cell lines with the hepG2 non-stem liver cancer cell line to investigate the differences between differentiated and more anaplastic cells. Molecular characterization (immunocytochemistry and rt-PCr analysis) of all the cell lines was carried out.Initially, the cells had a high proliferative potential, even when cultured in a medium supplemented with cytostatics, eliminated rhodamine 123 immediately in culture and also formed spheroids in suspension. The molecular characterization showed the expression of albumin, \u03b11-antitrypsin, \u03b1-fetoprotein, citokeratin-18, telomerase, CD90 and CD133. Low concentrations of arsenic trioxide lead to morphologic differentiation and differentiation-associated cytochemical features, like increased sensitivity to cytostatic drugs.Our study suggests that arsenic trioxide sensitizes liver stem-like cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy. Still, further studies on animal models will be needed before we implement this idea in human clinical trials.",

STUDY DESIGN:Retrospective analysis of the survey data, mainly of the cumulative number of transplants, types of transplants (autologous vs. allogeneic), types of conditioning as myeloablative (MAC) vs. reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) and trends in leukemias, hemoglobinopathies, SAA, inherited bone marrow failure syndromes amongst others.Fourteen teams from ten Eastern Mediterranean Region Organization (EMRO) countries reported their data (100% return rate) to the EMBMT for the years 2008-2009 with a total of 2608 first HSCT (1286 in 2008; 1322 in 2009). Allogeneic HSCT represented the majority (63%) in both years. The main indications for allogeneic HSCT were acute leukemias (732; 44%), bone marrow failure syndromes (331, 20%), hemoglobinopathies (255; 15%) and immune deficiencies (90; 5%). There was a progressive increase in the proportions of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cases transplanted beyond the first chronic phase (3; 7% of all CML cases in 2008 vs 13; 29% in 2009). The main indications for autologous transplants were plasma cell disorders (345; 36%) Hodgkin disease (256; 27%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (207; 22%) and solid tumors (83; 9%). RIC continued to show a progressive increase over the years (7% in 2007, 11% in 2008 and 13% in 2009), yet remained relatively low compared to contemporary practices in Europe published by EBMT. The vast majority (95%) of allo-HSCT sources were from sibling donors with a continued dominance of peripheral blood (PB) (1076; 63%), while cord blood transplant (CBT) increased to 83 (5% of allo-HSCT), matched unrelated donor (MUD) remained underutilized (1; 0%) and there were no haploidentical transplants reported. Large centers with >\u00a050 HSCT/year showed a plateau of the total number of allo-HSCT over the last 5 years that may be related to capacity issues and needs further study.There is an overall increased rate of HSCT in the EMRO region with a significant increase in utilization of CBT and allogeneic PB-HSCT as a valuable source. However, further research on outcome data and development of regional donor banks (CB and MUD) may help facilitate future planning to satisfy the regional needs and increase collaboration within the group and globally.",

High transplant-related mortality, in the range of 30% to 40%, previously seen with myeloablative conditioning regimens including total body irradiation plus cyclophosphamide has been significantly reduced by introducing less ablative preparative regimens, so called reduced-intensity conditioning. Cumulative evidence suggests encouraging prospects for allogeneic transplantation through improved outcomes of myeloma patients (overall survival exceeding 70% at 2 years in some studies); however, which patient population would benefit most from this treatment remains to be defined.

Heart and lung recipients with early-onset PTLD compared with late-onset PTLD were significantly more likely to be of the B cell type (100% vs. 89.8%, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a0.05). PTLD in patients with early onset was less likely to involve the skin (P\u00a0=\u00a0.05) and spleen (P\u00a0=\u00a0.015), but more frequently complications of the respiratory tract (P\u00a0=\u00a0.002).

Our aim was to critically appraise and synthesize available evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of CYTBI compared to BUCY as a conditioning regimen.Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BUCY with CYTBI.We did a systematic search of the indexed medical literature using appropriate keywords to identify potentially relevant articles. The primary outcome of interest was efficacy measured by overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Acute and late toxicity were secondary endpoints. Meta-analysis was attempted only on RCTs. A relative risk or risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each outcome in the meta-analysis.Fifteen non-randomized comparative studies involving 6280 patients were included in a narrative review without attempting a pooled analysis, in view of the potential for significant bias. Outcome data from seven RCTs involving 730 patients randomly assigned to either CYTBI or BUCY was pooled using meta-analytic methods. CYTBI was associated with a modest but non-significant reduction in all cause mortality (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.82, 95%CL: 0.64\u20131.05; P\u00a0=\u00a0.12) and relapse of leukemia (RR\u00a0=\u00a00.89, 95%CI: 0.72\u20131.10; P\u00a0=\u00a0.28). Transplant-related mortality (TRM) was significantly lesser with CYTBI compared to oral BUCY (RR-0.53, 95%CI: 0.31-0.90; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). The cumulative incidence of major complications was not significantly different between the two regimens, but specific complications varied according to the conditioning regimen. TBi-based regimens were associated with more severe late effects on growth and development in children.This analysis represents the largest comparative analyses of CYTBI with BUCY as a conditioning regimen prior to HSCT in the indexed medical literature. Conditioning regimen and disease (type and setting) can significantly affect outcomes. TRM is significantly lesser with CYTBI, but this does not translate into a significant survival benefit. There remain valid concerns regarding the late effects of TBI, particularly in children. Although not overly superior, the weight of evidence favors CYTBI over BUCY as a first choice-conditioning regimen in patients with leukemia.",

Autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) after high-dose melphalan chemotherapy can result in a prolonged response duration and survival in patients under 65 years of age.Single-center, retrospective study of patients treated at Paoli-Calmettes Institute Cancer Centre, between January 1994 and January 2007 (96\u00a0months)We compared the outcome of elderly (age >\u00a065\u00a0years) patients with younger patients aged between 60 and 65 years with MM.We compared 82 elderly patients with 104 younger patients. Except for age, both groups had comparable demographic features, disease characteristics, and prognostic factors. Induction VAD chemotherapy was comparable between the elderly (87%) and younger (94%) group. Prior to auto-SCT, the calculated hematopoietic cell transplantation-specific co-morbidity index was also comparable. With a median follow-up of 41 months (range, 5-227 months) after auto-SCT, 120 patients were still alive. Disease progression (n\u00a0=\u00a040; 61%) was the main cause of death, and it was comparable in the two groups. Auto-SCT-related mortality was 3.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a04/104) in younger and 3.7% (n\u00a0=\u00a03/82) in older patients. Comparing younger/older subjects, progression-free survival was significantly higher in the younger group (P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001).

In a Cox multivariate analysis model, none of the relevant characteristics was shown to be a critical prognostic feature for OS.Age was insignificant for both OS and transplant-related mortality.

Four years later a lung metastasis appeared and was again treated with a similar course of therapy, once again resulting in a complete response. it is suggested that in the era of modern image-guided radiotherapy patients with endometrial cancer who have relapsed within or outside the loco-regional area, should be carefully assessed for an eventual gross tumor eradication using high-dose localized radiotherapy, leaving as the only target of chemotherapy the microscopic undetectable disease.",

We investigated the efficacy and safety of high-dose LAmB (7.5\u00a0mg/kg once weekly) prophylaxis of fungal infections in allogeneic stem-cell transplanted (allo-SCT) patients with graft-versus-host disease (GvHD).Retrospective, comparative, single-center.Forty-two patients receiving high-dose prednisone for GvHD after allo-SCT had LAmB prophylaxis; 83 patients in the control group received other antifungal prophylaxis.In the LAmB prophylaxis group, the median duration of treatment was 7 weeks. The cumulative incidence of invasive fungal infection was 8% at 1 year after transplantation, 8% at 2 years and 16% at 3 years in the LAmB group vs. 36% at 1 year, 44% at 2 years and 49% at 3 years in the other prophylaxis group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.008). Fungal infection-related mortality after transplantation was observed in none of the patients in the LAmB prophylaxis group vs. 12 patients (14%) at 1 year, 14 patients (17%) at 2 years and 16 patients (19%) at 3 years in the control group (P\u00a0=\u00a0.005). The tolerance of the treatment was good with only 5 patients (12%) having a reversible nephrotoxicity leading to temporary treatment discontinuation.High-dose LAmB prophylaxis seems effective and well tolerated in this short series of allo-SCT patients with GvHD.

The aim of this study was to prospectively validate the predictive value of positron emission tomography (PET) in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus treated by pre-operative chemotherapy followed by esophagectomy.Prospective efficacy and toxicity study of patients enrolled between January 1999 and September 2003.Twenty-one patients with SCC of the esophagus who were potentially resectable underwent 18F-FD G PET imaging before the first cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and at least 14 days after the third cycle. A patient was classified as a metabolic responder when the metabolic activity of the primary tumor as measured by the maximum standardized uptake values had decreased by 50% or more at the time of the second 18F-FDG PET.The median age of the study cohort was 60 years with a range of 39-70 years; 12 patients were males and 9 were females. 18F-FD G PET had increased activity in the primary tumor in all patients. Metabolic response occurred in 14/21 patients (66%), while 7/21 (33%) patients did not show a metabolic response. Metabolic ressponders had a high clinical response rate (92%), a median progression free survival (PFS) of 16.4\u00a0months and a median overall survival (OS) of 35.3\u00a0months. In contrast, prognosis was poor for metabolic non-responders with a clinical response rate of 42% (P\u00a0=\u00a0.025), a median PFS of 7.13\u00a0months (P\u00a0=\u00a0.032) and median OS of 12 months (P\u00a0=\u00a0.038).Our results demonstrate that changes in tumor metabolic activity after neoadjuvant chemo-therapy predicts PFS and OS in esophageal SCC patients.",

Valganciclovir (VGC) is a prodrug of ganciclovir with high bioavailability.HSCT patients with documented CMV infection (as defined by positive CMV antigenemia) were treated as outpatients with VGC at a starting dose of 900\u00a0mg twice daily for 1 week. Those who were antigenemia negative after one week received 900\u00a0mg once daily for another week and treatment was subsequently discontinued.

     "abstract": "Natural killer (NK) cell therapies are emerging worldwide as promising anticancer treatments, exploiting the fast cytolytic action of NK effectors and their potentially broad applicability against a wide range of malignancies. Until recently, clinical protocols have mainly involved freshly isolated NK cells or short-term activated NK cells or lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. However, overall effector numbers and their anticancer potencies remained restricted, which poses a limiting factor to clinical efficacy. Recent developments in the field aim to improve clinical trial designs by increasing effector to target cell ratios in vivo and by application of superior cytotoxic NK effectors. Large-scale production of clinical grade NK cells through long-term activation in ex vivo cultures are another novel means in achieving these goals. However, such procedures require compliance with the strict Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations to ensure quality and safety of the NK cell product. Although the overall number of new protocols still remains comparably low, some of the protocols are already translated into clinical use. Also striking is the diversity of the different protocols proposed. We highlight in this review the most recent developments in the NK cell field with a focus on long-term NK cell expansion. Critical issues relating to this novel and promising type of therapy are highlighted and discussed.",

     "abstract": "Thalassemic patients have an increased risk for thromboembolic complications. To determine if this might be due to a deficiency in protein C, we investigated the status of the protein C anticoagulant pathway in thalassemia major patients and its relationship to the hypercoagulable state.Fifty patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major (30 non-splenectomized and 20 splenectomized) and 20 healthy children as a control group were tested for levels of serum ferritin, liver enzymes, serum albumin, fibrinogen, protein C and protein S, thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT) and D-dimer.Thalassemic patients had lower levels of protein C and S and higher levels of D-dimer and TAT than the control group. These findings were more obvious in splenectomized patients and in those with infrequent blood transfusion.Protein C plays a major role in the hypercoagulable state in thalassemic patients. These findings raise the issue as to whether it would be cost-beneficial to recommend prophylactic antithrombotic therapy in high-risk thalassemic patients. A wider prospective study is necessary to delineate under which circumstances therapy might be needed, and at what level of protein C deficiency to start prophylactic antithrombotic therapy.",

Clinically and/or radiologically confirmed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE) were assessed within 2 weeks before and after splenectomy. None had prophylactic anticoagulants immediately after surgery. Follow up of those who developed complications continued for at least 2 additional years to assess for contributing factors that may have been masked at the time of occurrence.Two (9.5%) Ls group had acute PE within 5 days of LS and their platelet count reached 500\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/\u03bcL within 4 days and 1000\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0103/\u03bcL within 7 days after surgery. Three conversions to OS occurred; none had VTE. DVT occurred in 3 patients (10.7%) in the Os group; none were life threatening. There were no deaths.Life-threatening venous thromboembolic events are serious complications after LS and OS for ITP patients if prophylactic anticoagulants are not administered. Patients at risk are those who both have an exponential rise of the platelet count, although factors other than the platelet count may be contributing in OS. Postsplenectomy, ITP should be considered as a thrombophilic condition and studies of additional measures to prevent such events are warranted.",

Bone marrow cytogenetic analysis for the Philadelphia chromosome and nested polymerase chain reaction for BCR-ABL1 were both negative. Immunosuppression was abruptly discontinued, and by day 180, all gastric lesions had completely disappeared. However, there were histological signs of graft-versus-host disease.

Trials were divided into two groups according to therapy. The rates of plasmablastic lymphoma were analyzed using a fixed-effects model. Sensitivity analyses (on publication type, statistical model) were performed to further detect and evaluate clinically significant heterogeneity. Tests of survival for plasmablastic lymphoma were also performed by using Kaplan-Meier method.Meta-analysis result showed that the prognosis of plasmablastic lymphoma patients was statistically different in the patients receiving HAART in addition to chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy than in the patients receiving the chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy alone (pooled relative risk\u00a0=\u00a03.04; P\u00a0=\u00a0.03).

We assessed the toxicity of metronomic chemotherapy and the response and progression-free survival in patients with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).We prospectively studied 41 patients with a diagnosis of relapsed and/or refractory DLBCL who may have received any number of preceding therapies (as long as one included an anthracycline) and were not candidates for bone marrow transplantation. They received oral cyclophosphamide (50\u00a0mg every day), oral methotrexate (2.5\u00a0mg 4 times/week) and high-dose oral celecoxib (400\u00a0mg twice daily) until there was disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.All 41 patients (median age, 56 years) were evaluable for toxicity and response, with a median follow up of 9.1\u00a0months (range, 4-35 months). At relapse, 51.2% had a high international prognostic index. The treatment protocol was well tolerated with no major toxicities.

We sought to identify potential CD8\u00a0+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes that specifically recognised peptides derived from the MPP11 antigen.A computer-based epitope prediction program SYFPEITHI, was used to predict peptides from the MPP11 protein that bind to the most common HLA- A*0201 molecule. Peptide binding capacity to the HLA-A*0201 molecule was measured using the T2 TAP-deficient, HLA-A*0201-positive cell line. Dendritic cells were pulsed with peptides and then used to generate CD8\u00a0+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL). The CML leukemic cell line K562-A2.1 naturally expressing the MPP11 antigen and engineered to express the HLA-A*0201 molecule was used as the target cell.We have identified a potential HLA-A*0201 binding epitope (STLCQVEPV) named MPP-4 derived from the MPP11 protein which was used to generate a CTL line. Interestingly, this CTL line specifically recognized peptide-loaded target cells in both ELISPOT and cytotoxic assays. Importantly, this CTL line exerted a cytotoxic effect towards the CML leukemic cell line K562-A2.1.This is the first study to describe a novel epitope derived from the MPP11 antigen that has been recognized by human CD8\u00a0+ CTL.",
