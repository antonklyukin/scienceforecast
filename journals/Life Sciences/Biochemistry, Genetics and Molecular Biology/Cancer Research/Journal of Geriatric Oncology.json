     "abstract": "The Cancer and Aging Research Group's (CARG) Toxicity Score was designed to predict grade \u22653 chemotherapy-related toxicity in adults aged \u226565\u202fyrs. commencing chemotherapy for a solid organ cancer. We aimed to evaluate the CARG Score and compare it to oncologists' estimates for predicting severe chemotherapy toxicity in older adults.Patients aged \u226565\u202fyrs. starting chemotherapy for a solid organ cancer had their CARG Score (range 0\u201323) calculated. Their treating oncologist, blinded to these results, independently estimated each patient's risk of severe chemotherapy toxicity (0\u2013100%). Toxicities were captured prospectively. The predictive value of the CARG Score and oncologists' estimates was estimated using logistic regression and in terms of Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AU-ROC).126 patients from ten oncologists at two sites participated. The median age was 72\u202fyrs. (range 65\u201384). The median CARG Score was 7 (range 0\u201317); the median oncologist estimate of risk was 30% (range 3\u201380%), and these measures were not correlated (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.01). 64 patients (52%) experienced grade\u202f\u2265\u202f3 toxicity. Rates of severe toxicity in low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups by CARG Score were 58%, 47%, and 58% respectively, and 63%, 44%, and 67% by oncologist estimate. Severe chemotherapy toxicity was not predicted by the CARG Score (OR 1.04, 95%CI 0.92\u20131.18, p\u202f=\u202f.54, AU-ROC 0.52), or oncologists' estimates (OR 1.00, 95%CI 0.98\u20131.02, p\u202f=\u202f.82, AU-ROC 0.52).Neither the CARG Score, nor oncologists' estimates based on clinical judgement, predicted severe chemotherapy-related toxicity in our population of older adults with cancer. Methods to improve risk prediction are needed.",

We sought oncologists' views about the value of GA and the CARG Score when making decisions about chemotherapy for their older patients.Patients aged \u226565\u202fyrs. with a plan to start chemotherapy for a solid organ cancer underwent a GA and had their CARG Score calculated. Results of the GA and CARG Score were provided to treating oncologists who then completed a questionnaire on the value of these measures for each patient.We enrolled 30 patients from eight oncologists. Patients had a median age of 76\u202fyears and most (77%) were ECOG performance status 0 or 1. Risk category for severe chemotherapy toxicity by CARG Score was low in 7 patients (23%), intermediate in 18 (60%), and high in 5 (17%). The GA provided oncologists new information for 12 patients (40%), most frequently in the domains of function and nutrition. Knowledge of the GA prompted supportive interventions for 7 patients (23%). Oncologists considered modifications to recommended chemotherapy based on the CARG Score for 2 patients (7%) (one more intensive and one less intensive), and based on GA for no patients. Oncologists judged the GA and CARG Score as useful in 26 (87%) and 25 (83%) patients, respectively.Although oncologists valued the GA and CARG Score, they rarely used them to modify chemotherapy. The GA provided new information that prompted supportive interventions in one quarter of patients.",

GA may help oncologists optimise care for older patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to explore the views of Australian medical oncologists regarding the incorporation of geriatric screening tools, GA and collaboration with geriatricians into routine clinical practice.Members of the Medical Oncology Group of Australia were invited to complete an online survey that evaluated respondent demographics, practice characteristics, treatment decision-making factors, use of GA, and access to geriatricians.Sixty-nine respondents identified comorbidities, polypharmacy, and poor functional status as the most frequent challenges in caring for older patients with cancer. Physical function, social supports and nutrition were the most frequent factors influencing treatment decision-making. The majority of respondents perceived value in GA and geriatrician review, although access was a barrier for referral. Such services would need to be responsive, providing reports within two weeks for the majority of respondents.Despite an emerging evidence base for the potential benefits of GA and collaboration with geriatricians, medical oncologists reported a lack of access but a desire to engage with these services.",

     "abstract": "With rise in incidence and prevalence of cancers in the ageing population, the need for an age sensitive comprehensive assessment measure has been felt. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is often difficult to implement due to time and logistic constraints. A brief assessment tool encompassing the specific domains of the CGA would be a better way to assess older adults with cancer. These tools exist but have not necessarily been culturally adapted. The main aim of the study was to develop a culturally relevant short geriatric assessment tool and explore its psychometric properties.An initial item pool was formed after review of the literature and study of the existing scales. This draft tool was then pre and pilot tested to finalize the items and check the feasibility of application. The final tool was validated by exploratory factor analysis on a sample of 100 older patients with cancer.After pre and pilot study on fifteen and thirty older patients with cancer respectively, this tool consisting of a total of 38 items spread over eight domains was developed and validated on a sample of 100 subjects. Due to co-linearity, three items were deleted after exploratory factor analysis, bringing the final item number to35. The Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 and the intra-class correlation co-efficient (ICC) was 0.94. Thus, the final tool had 13 questions with sub-parts (35 items in total). The time taken to administer the tool was around 25\u202fmin.The tool developed is valid and reliable and can be used for the initial assessment and further care planning of older Indian patients with cancer.",

     "abstract": "Geriatric assessment (GA) is recommended for older adults\u202f\u2265\u202f70\u202fyears with cancer to guide treatment selection. Screening tools such as the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) and G6 have been used to identify patients at highest need of GA. Whether either tool predicts a change in oncologic treatment following GA is unclear.Patients attending a geriatric oncology clinic between July 2015 and June 2017 who completed a VES-13 and underwent subsequent GA were included. Clinical information was extracted from a prospectively maintained database. G6 scores were assigned retrospectively. Patients were stratified into those who were \u201cVES-13 positive\u201d (score\u202f\u2265\u202f3) and \u201cVES-13 negative\u201d (score\u202f<\u202f3). Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between VES-13 score, G6 score, and treatment modification.Ninety-nine patients were seen prior to initiating cancer treatment. The median VES-13 score was 7; with 81.8% of patients scoring \u22653. The treatment plan was modified in 47.5% of patients after GA. VES-13 score was predictive of treatment plan modification (63.0% among VES-13 positive versus 16.7% among VES-13 negative patients; p\u202f=\u202f0.001). G6 performed similarly to the VES-13. The only statistically significant predictor of treatment change in multivariable analysis was performance status.VES-13 positive patients are more likely to undergo treatment modification to reduce treatment intensity or supportive care only. The VES-13 may provide oncologists with a rapid, reliable way of identifying vulnerability in older adults with cancer who may need further GA prior to commencing cancer treatment.",

     "abstract": "Among the various instruments recommended by the International Society of Geriatric Oncology, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly used cognitive screening test before oncological treatment. Although the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) has been shown to be more sensitive than the MMSE in several pathologies, no specific data exist for older patients with cancer. We aimed to compare the proportions of older patients with cancer who had screened positive for cognitive impairment according to the MMSE and MoCA scores obtained during a pretherapeutic geriatric assessment (GA) in oncology.This prospective study was conducted among 66 patients older than 70\u202fyears who were candidates for a first-line treatment for either a solid tumor or hematological malignancy. Patients with brain tumor or previously known dementia were ineligible. During GA, cognitive function was assessed using both the MoCA and the MMSE tests administered in a random order.Median age was 78\u202fyears. Most patients (n\u202f=\u202f43, 65.2%) had a solid tumor. The median scores were 26 [11\u201330] for MMSE and 24 [8\u201330] for MoCA. Thirteen (19.7%) and 44 (66.7%) patients were screened positive for cognitive impairment according to MMSE and MoCA scores, respectively. Overall, 55 (66.7%) patients were screened positive: 12 (21.8%) on both scores, 32 (70.5%) with the MoCA only, and one patient with MMSE only (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001).The MoCA test seems to be most relevant to screen for cognitive impairment in older patients with cancer.",

     "abstract": "The Mental Health Index (MHI) is widely used as a measure of mental health status, but has not been evaluated in the geriatric oncology population. This study evaluated the MHI-17 in a geriatric oncology population, to establish validity and scoring rules.The Carolina Senior Registry (NCT01137825) was used to obtain data for 686 patients with cancer 65 and older who completed the MHI-17. The 17-item patient-reported measure produces one total score summing across four domains: anxiety, depression, positive affect, and sense of belonging. Cronbach's alpha (\u03b1), confirmatory factor analyses (CFA), item-response theory (IRT) analyses, and differential item functioning (DIF) analyses were used to evaluate internal consistency and validity.The revised MHI retained the 13 best-fitting items from the MHI-17 and resulted in a final model that included two subscales: anxiety (four items, RMSEA 0.11; CFI 0.99; TLI 0.98) and depression (9 items, RMSEA 0.10; CFI 0.96; TL 0.95). IRT analyses of the four anxiety items indicated good fit (RMSEA 0.08) and precise measurement of adults with poor mental health, and the nine depression items also fit well (RMSEA 0.05). No meaningful differences were found by sex, education, or treatment stage. Scores were developed to provide meaningful norms. The new MHI-13 is a shorter, more accurate way to assess mental health in older adults with cancer and most importantly allows clinicians to separately identify anxiety and/or depression - a clinically important distinction as treatment differs among these two types of mental health impairment.",

Patients aged \u226570\u202fyears were compared to patients aged <70\u202fyears. Risk factors for case-fatality rates in older patients were identified.We compared 217 episodes of bacteremia involving older patients and 525 occurring in younger patients. Older patients had more frequently other comorbidities, but were less commonly neutropenic and carried less frequently central venous catheters. Bacteremia from an abdominal source was more common in patients \u226570, whereas an endogenous source and catheter-related infection were less frequently observed. Streptococcus bovis group (3.7% vs. 0.8%, p\u202f=\u202f.01) and Listeria monocytogenes (4.6% vs. 1.9%, p\u202f=\u202f.04) were more common in older patients, whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were less frequently found (1.4% vs. 5.3% p\u202f=\u202f.01). Infection due to multi-drug resistant (MDR) strains was significantly higher in older patients (17.1% vs. 10.9%, p\u202f=\u202f.02), who in addition, presented higher overall mortality (35.4% vs 27.7%, p\u202f=\u202f.04). In older patients, lung tumor, neutropenia, and low grade fever were associated with early mortality, whereas comorbidities, corticosteroids, septic shock and inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy were associated with overall mortality.We identified remarkable differences in the etiology and sources of bacteremia between older and younger cancer patients with bacteremia. Older patients had more frequent infection due to MDR organisms and presented a higher overall mortality. Corticosteroids and inadequate empirical antibiotic therapy are modifiable factors associated with mortality.",

Patient and tumour characteristics, as well as applied treatments, were described by age groups and prognostic risk groups. Relative survival rates were determined, including multivariable relative survival regression analyses. Additionally, to assess if age was associated with receiving curative treatment, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.In total, 48% of all patients were 70\u202fyears of age or older. Older patients had a higher prostate specific antigen (PSA) level, a higher Gleason score, as well as a higher disease stage at diagnosis. The 10-year relative survival decreased with increasing age, and after adjustment for disease stage, Gleason score, PSA level, and comorbidities, older patients had a worse survival rate. Older patients with intermediate- or high-risk disease appeared to be treated less often with curative intent compared with younger patients after adjustment for tumour stage, Gleason score, PSA level, and comorbidities. Older patients with intermediate/high risk prostate cancer treated with curative intent showed a 10-year relative survival rate similar to younger patients.The survival of older patients was worse than younger patients. This might be due to suboptimal treatment, as older patients were less often treated with curative intent. Although the increased risk of treatment complications should be considered, age alone should not be a decisive factor when offering a treatment.",

     "abstract": "Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) is prevalent in the older patients, who are a vulnerable population with multiple co-morbidities and at increased risk of complications. Radical cystectomy is often not suitable, hence radical radiotherapy (RT) is an alternative option. We reviewed the outcomes of older patients treated with RT with or without concurrent chemotherapy (CRT) at our institution.We retrospectively reviewed patients aged 65\u202fyears and above treated with radical RT for MIBC at our institution between March 2002 to January 2017. Data was collected from institutional medical records and RT databases. The primary outcome was 2- and 5-year overall survival (OS), recurrence free survival (RFS), and toxicities. Univariate cox proportional hazard regression models were performed to identify independent factors with significant impact on survival.We identified 45 patients (34 males, 11 females) with a median age of 77\u202fyears (range 65\u201395). All patients received maximal transurethral resection of the bladder tumour prior to RT. Median dose of total RT was 64\u202fGy (range 50\u201369.8\u202fGy). Twenty one patients (47%) received CRT. Planned treatment was completed in 42 (93.3%) patients. Median follow-up was 31\u202fmonths (range 1\u2013147\u202fmonths). The 2- and 5-year OS was 64% and 44%, respectively. The 2- and 5-year RFS was 68% and 49%, respectively. Median RFS was 34\u202fmonths (range 8\u2013121\u202fmonths). Median OS was 56\u202fmonths (range 18\u2013100\u202fmonths). Univariate analysis showed that performance status (0\u20131 vs. 2\u20133; HR 2.7, 95% CI 1.07\u20136.8, p\u202f=\u202f0.035) and International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) group (\u22642 vs. >2; HR 3.23, 95% CI 1.12\u20138.64, p\u202f=\u202f0.019) were significantly associated with increased hazard for death. One patient (2%) had grade 3 cystitis.Radical RT is well tolerated in older patients with MIBC. We report outcomes similar to published data. Older patients should be considered for curative treatment despite their age. However, careful selection is warranted as frail patients (PS \u22652; SIOG >2) may benefit less.",

At a routine follow-up visit, women (N\u202f=\u202f107) completed standardized symptom measures: Brief Fatigue Inventory, Brief Pain Inventory, Menopause Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Neurotoxicity scales. Two performance measures assessed function: grip strength (Jamar dynamometer; n\u202f=\u202f71) and timed get-up-and-go (TUG; n\u202f=\u202f103). Analyses were performed with an overall symptom composite score.

We utilized multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate factors associated with RS testing as well as a high-risk categorization for those who underwent testing.

A smaller proportion of patients in the older group (8%) underwent RS testing than in the younger group (18%). Of the patients who underwent testing, distribution of RS was similar between groups. High-risk categorization independently predicted a higher likelihood of death for older patients (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% confidence interval 1.15\u20131.90). Among patients with high-risk RS, chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of death in the younger group, but not in the older group.Older women are less likely to receive RS testing, but when tested, older patients have a similar distribution of RS as compared to younger patients.

     "abstract": "Breast and ovarian cancer are common malignancies among older adults, causing significant morbidity and mortality. Although most cases of breast and ovarian cancer are sporadic, a significant proportion is caused by mutations in cancer susceptibility genes, most often breast cancer susceptibility genes (BRCA) 1 and 2. Furthermore, some breast and ovarian tumors are phenotypically similar to those with BRCA mutations, a phenomenon known as \u201cBRCAness\u201d. BRCA mutations and \u201cBRCAness\u201d lead to defects in DNA repair, which may be a target for therapeutic agents such as Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. PARP inhibitors are novel medications which lead to double-strand breaks resulting in cell death due to synthetic lethality, and which have been shown to be effective in patients with advanced breast and ovarian cancers with or without BRCA mutations. Three different PARP inhibitors (olaparib, niraparib, and rucaparib) have been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer and one (olaparib) for breast cancer harboring BRCA mutations. Here, we review the currently available evidence regarding the use of PARP inhibitors for the treatment of patients with breast and ovarian cancer, with a particular focus on the inclusion of older adults in clinical trials of these therapies. Additionally, we provide an overview of currently ongoing studies of PARP inhibitors in breast and ovarian cancer, and include recommendations for increasing the evidence-base for using these medications among older patients.",

Early detection, surgical intervention, therapeutic radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapies and molecularly targeted agents are transforming the lives of patients with breast cancer, markedly improving their survival. Although current breast cancer treatments are largely successful in producing cancer remission and extending lifespan, there is concern that these treatments may have long lasting detrimental effects on cancer survivors, in part, through their impact on non-tumor cells. Presently, the impact of breast cancer treatment on normal cells, its impact on cellular function and its effect on the overall function of the individual are incompletely understood. In particular, it is unclear whether breast cancer and/or its treatments are associated with an accelerated aging phenotype. In this review, we consider breast cancer survivorship from the perspective of accelerated aging, and discuss the evidence suggesting that women treated for breast cancer may suffer from an increased rate of physical and cognitive decline that likely corresponds with underlying vulnerabilities of genome instability, epigenetic changes, and cellular senescence.",

Associations between cancer and age-related physiologic changes have a direct impact on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of cancer therapies and can affect drug dosing, dose intensity, efficacy, safety and quality of life. The breadth and depth of these issues, however, have not been fully evaluated because the majority of clinical trials have focused on a younger and healthier population. As a consequence, little information is available to support clinicians in making evidence-based decisions regarding treatment with cancer therapies in older adults, especially those over age 75. Prior clinical pharmacology reviews summarized the literature on how age-related physiologic changes can influence and affect conventional and targeted anti-cancer treatments. Our article provides an updated review with expanded information that includes small molecule kinase inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, immunotherapies, hormonal, conventional, and miscellaneous agents. Additionally, our article integrates how functional age, determined by the geriatric assessment (GA), can also influence treatment-related effects and health outcomes. Broadening cancer therapy trials to capture not only chronologic age but also functional age would allow clinicians to better identify subsets of older adults who benefit from treatment versus those most vulnerable to morbidity and/or mortality.",

     "abstract": "Improved assessment strategies are needed to individualize treatment for adults of all ages receiving palliative chemotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our aim was to evaluate the utility of the Fried Frailty Index (FFI) and a cancer-specific geriatric assessment (GA) to predict chemotherapy toxicity and overall survival (OS).We conducted a multi-site pilot study of 50 patients with newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC, age\u202f\u2265\u202f18\u202fyears. All participants received carboplatin AUC 6, paclitaxel 200\u202fmg/m2 every 3\u202fweeks. FFI and the GA were administered prior to chemotherapy. A GA toxicity risk score was calculated. Grade 3\u20135 toxicity was assessed during 1st two cycles of chemotherapy. OS was measured from chemotherapy initiation. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were fit to estimate the association between baseline characteristics and toxicity and OS respectively.Among 50 participants, 48 received chemotherapy and were evaluable. The mean age was 68.5 y (range 42\u201386), 79% male, 85% KPS \u226580. The median OS was 8\u202fmonths. Many (27%) met FFI criteria for frailty with \u22653 impairments. Impairments detected by the GA were common. In multivariable analyses both FFI\u202f\u2265\u202f3 and GA toxicity risk score\u202f>\u202f7 were independently associated with higher odds of toxicity (Odds ratio [OR] 7.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1\u201344.6 and OR 4.3; 95% CI 1.0\u201317.7, respectively) in first cycle chemotherapy. Neither score was associated with OS.Frailty predicts chemotherapy toxicity during first cycle. Frailty assessment may inform toxicity risk regardless of chronologic age.",

HCP were more depressed than CS (GDS-15 Mean-score\u202f=\u202f3.0 vs. 2.3; p\u202f=\u202f0.006). Both HCP and CS had an average of 5 comorbid conditions. In comparison to CS, HCP were found to have higher levels of polypharmacy and limited activity, higher prevalence in polyneuropathy, and higher symptom burden of fatigue, insomnia, and appetite loss. The comorbidity-index was particularly high in older patients, in patients with low education level as well as in patients with a high depression-score.Older HCP are at increased risk for depression and a variety of physical impairments compared to control population.

A group-based trajectory model identified distinct functional trajectories based on a total disability score during the twelve months pre- and post-diagnosis. We evaluated associations between potential risk factors at the time of cancer diagnosis and worsening disability post-diagnosis, explored functional transitions from pre- to post-diagnosis and identified participants whose functional trajectories worsened.Three pre-diagnosis functional trajectories were identified among 170 participants (mean age at diagnosis: 83\u202fyears (range: 73\u2013105\u202fyears): mild, moderate, and severe disability. Three post-diagnosis functional trajectories were identified among 158 non-decedents: mild, moderate, and severe disability.

Communication about these age-related concerns can potentially lead to further assessment and subsequent clinical interventions to improve treatment decision-making and patients' quality of life. Yet, little is known about the communication of age-related concerns between oncologists, patients, and caregivers.This study is a secondary analysis of data from the Values and Options in Cancer Care (VOICE) study. Audio-recorded and transcribed outpatient clinical oncology encounters with 37 patients with advanced cancer \u226560\u202fyears of age were content-analyzed. Two trained coders used a structured coding scheme based on pre-specified geriatric assessment (GA) domains to examine the transcripts for the frequency and quality of communication about age-related concerns. Atlas.ti version 6 was used for all analyses.The median age of the patients was 66\u202fyears (range\u202f=\u202f60\u201390\u202fyears); patients were mostly female (26/37), married (22/37), and White (36/37). Out of 37 audio-recorded visits, 31 had at least one mention of an age-related concern with a total of 70 mentions. Oncologists initiated communication about age-related concerns half of the time (53%). When age-related concerns were mentioned, half of the time (50%) the oncologist did not implement further evidence-based interventions to address the age-related concern (e.g., conduct a cognitive screen for a memory concern).Interventions are needed to improve the frequency and quality of the communication about age-related concerns to improve the care of older adults with cancer.",

This process is even more complicated for older (\u226570\u202fyears) patients as the lack of empirical evidence on treatment regimens in patients with age-related problems such as comorbidity and polypharmacy, necessitates a patient-centred approach.This study investigates the decision making process for older patients with cancer during multidisciplinary team meetings and the extent to which geriatric evaluation and geriatric expertise contribute to this process.Non-participant observations of 171 cases (\u226570\u202fyears) during 30 multidisciplinary team meetings in five hospitals and systematically analysed using a medical decision making framework. All cases were in patients with colon or rectal cancer.First, not all steps from the medical decision making framework were followed. Second, we found limited use of patient-centred information such as (age-related) patient characteristics and patient preferences during the decision making process. Third, a geriatric perspective was largely missing in multidisciplinary team meetings.This study uncovers gaps in the treatment decision making process for older patients with cancer during multidisciplinary team meetings.

     "abstract": "Cancer multidisciplinary meetings (MDMs) are central to treatment decision making. The language used in MDMs may influence treatment decisions, yet has received little research attention. This study aimed to examine the terminology used to describe non-cancer items in the discussion of older people within cancer MDMs.MDMs of four tumour streams were attended over twelve weeks. For each person aged 70 or older discussed, the following was hand recorded: age, gender, and phrases describing non-cancer items and patient views. A qualitative thematic analysis was employed to examine the text.Twenty cancer MDMs were attended, at which 71 people aged 70 or older were discussed. Age, comorbid medical conditions, and general descriptors emerged as the areas in which non-cancer information was presented. In contrast to the medical terminology used to describe comorbid medical conditions, non-specific general descriptors, such as \u2018fit\u2019, \u2018well\u2019, and \u2018good\u2019, were used to describe other aspects of older people. Adverbs, including \u2018very\u2019, \u2018pretty\u2019, and \u2018quite\u2019, often accompanied general descriptors. The, often subtle, intonation and context associated with these adverbs resulted in markedly different meanings.Non-objective, potentially ambiguous general descriptors were commonly used to encompass non-disease aspects of older people in cancer MDMs. These descriptors may have the potential to sway treatment recommendations. However, their frequent use suggests team members recognise that non-disease aspects of a person, aside from chronological age, are considerations in treatment recommendations. Therefore, strategies to increase discussion of non-cancer items in a more objective manner may be acceptable to MDM attendees.",

Herein we conducted a retrospective analysis for the effect of panitumumab in the management of older patients (\u226565\u202fyears) patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) in the Hellenic Oncology Research Group's (HORG) database.\u03a4he efficacy of panitumumab-based chemotherapy as front-line treatment in older patients with mCRC was assessed.In total, 110 older patients with KRAS exon 2 wild type tumors were treated with chemotherapy plus panitumumab. The median age was 74\u202fyears; 69.9% of the patients were male, with left-sided primary tumors (78.2%), ECOG Performance Status 0\u20131 (95.4%) and median number of metastatic sites 2. Sixty-two (Overall Response Rate-ORR: 56.4%; 95% CI: 48.8%\u201368.1%) achieved an objective response, while 21 (19.1%) had stable disease. Median Progression free survival (PFS) was 9.4\u202fmonths (95% CI: 7.8\u201311.0\u202fmonths) and median Overall survival (OS) 23.0\u202fmonths (95% CI: 20.6\u201325.3\u202fmonths). Additionally, a statistically significant difference in ORR (62.7% vs. 33.3%; p\u202f=\u202f.014), median PFS (12.9 vs. 5.7\u202fmonths; p\u202f=\u202f.001) and median OS (31.6 vs. 16.7\u202fmonths; p\u202f<\u202f.001) was observed in patients with left-sided compared to right-sided primary tumor. There was no treatment-related death. Grade 3\u20134 toxicities were neutropenia (8.9%) and diarrhea (14.5%) whereas skin rash grade 2 or 3 was recorded in 41.1% and 10.7%, respectively.The results of this retrospective study provide the evidence that combination chemotherapy plus panitumumab is active and well tolerated in older patients with mCRC.",

     "abstract": "More than half of patients diagnosed with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are age 65 or older. However, older patients are often unable to meet eligibility criteria for clinical trial enrollment due to multiple factors, such as comorbidities and polypharmacy, which leads to under-representation of this population in clinical trials. Given this, efficacy data from the registration trials may not apply to older patients. Our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of first-line and salvage-line treatment in older patients, and compare efficacy between older and younger patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC).Pivotal phase three clinical trials for first-line and salvage-line treatments were included if they reported overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) results stratified by age (</\u226565\u202fyears). The meta-analysis of OS and PFS stratified by age </\u226565\u202fyears was conducted in the context of Bayesian hierarchical log-linear models with both within and between study variance components.In the first-line setting, data suggests that Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab is the most efficacious treatment for older patients (PFS hazard ratio (HR) 0.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23\u20131.45, probability best 39.7%). In the salvage-line setting, Cabozantinib is likely the most efficacious therapy for older patients (PFS HR 0.15, 95% CI 0.08\u20130.28, probability best 77.2%). Evidence suggests that the majority of first-line treatments have worse efficacy in older patients compared to younger patients.For older patients, first-line Nivolumab plus Ipilimumab and salvage-line Cabozantinib may offer the best survival outcomes. Most first-line drugs for mRCC have inferior performance in older patients compared to their younger counterparts.",

     "abstract": "Though the optimal treatment regimen in older patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains to be established, multiple randomized studies have supported the use of hypofractionated (1\u20133\u202fweeks) versus traditional regimens (6\u202fweeks). Here we examine hypofractionated regimen practice patterns among older patients with GBM.We used the National Cancer Database and included individuals aged \u226565\u202fyears with GBM diagnosed from 2005 to 2014 undergoing biopsy/resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation initiated \u22648-weeks of diagnosis. We defined traditional fractionation as \u2264200\u202fcGy and hypofractionation as >200\u202fcGy. We compared patient characteristics using a chi-squared test and multivariable logistic regression. We compared 90-day mortality rates following initiation of radiation using the Wald statistic in propensity score matched cohorts.The final cohort included 14,931 individuals with 1524 undergoing hypofractionated treatment. From 2005 to 2014 hypofractionated utilization rates were 7%, 9%, 13%, and 18% among those 65\u201369, 70\u201374, 75\u201379, and \u226580\u202fyears of age, respectively. Patients treated at an academic/research center had a >60% increased odds (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.43\u20131.81) of undergoing hypofractionated regimens versus a community center. Ninety-day mortality rates were high in both groups (hypofractionated: 32%; traditional: 24%; p\u202f<\u202f.001).The majority of older GBM patients do not undergo hypofractionated radiation. High 90-day mortality in both groups suggests that hypofractionation may improve the survival-to-treatment time ratio and positively impact patient quality of life. Hypofractionated radiation regimens for GBM should be discussed with older patients and considered for inclusion in efforts to improve the quality and value of cancer care.",

The use of screening tools to identify vulnerable patients is essential. This study was performed to establish whether the G8 scale can be used for screening older patients with glioblastoma.We retrospectively reviewed the files of patients assessed by the G8 scale and diagnosed with glioblastoma at a single center from January 2010 to July 2017. Patients aged 65\u202fyears or older were classified into three groups (more efficiently than two groups) according to their G8 score to identify those with a poor prognosis: high score group, G8 score 14.5\u201317; intermediate score group, G8 score 10.5\u201314; and low score group, G8 score\u202f<\u202f10.5.Of 89 patients, 19% were classified into the high score group, 43% into the intermediate score group, and 38% into the low score group.

Oncologist opinions were captured via open-ended interviews and summarized.A total of 95 patients who met the inclusion criteria were approached; 61 of them consented (64%). For health status, at all time-points, there were no significant differences between the two groups. The number of emergency department and family physician visits was low overall; there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups at any time point. All interviewed oncologists (eight of fourteen invited) were satisfied with the intervention, but wanted more straightforward recommendations and earlier GA results.No difference was found in terms of relationships between GA and utility-based health status or GA and healthcare use. Underreporting of healthcare use was possible. Oncologists welcome GA feedback and prefer to receive it in pre-treatment decision context. Larger trials with earlier GA are warranted.",

Chronological age is a poor predictor of cancer treatment outcomes and of the need for rehabilitation services. While newer symptom management systems and assessments are slowly becoming used in the clinic to improve communication between providers and survivors, such assessments are rarely used to trigger a referral to rehabilitation. Cancer rehabilitation for older adults with cancer has the potential to improve the quality of life and decrease disability caused by cancer and its treatments. One barrier to referral to cancer rehabilitation remains an understanding of what cancer rehabilitation is, and who, when, where, and why to refer to rehabilitation services. This report utilizes examples of three popular geriatric, distress and symptom measures to help answer these questions.",

Natural ageing processes lead to deterioration of organ function, making older patients more vulnerable and at risk for experiencing less-favourable outcomes and complications after surgery. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as music, may be preferable to medical interventions in older people, who are at risk for adverse effects and drug interactions due to altered physiology and drug metabolism. We aimed to assess the effect of music on postoperative recovery in older patients and to determine the underpinning theoretical modelsThis systematic review used the databases PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsychINFO, and R\u00e9pertoire International de Litt\u00e9rature Musicale (RILM). Clinical studies published, until 2015, investigating music as a single intervention for hospitalised patients postoperative, population mean age 60\u202fyears or older were selected. All types of postoperative music interventions, consisting of single or more sessions, which take place at a hospital ward. All patient outcomes were included. The search and screening was performed twice, independently, and seventeen articles were finally selected.Four theoretical models were detected underpinning the effect of music on postoperative recovery. The way the music interventions were shaped, varied strongly. Therefore it remained unclear what is the most effective way of performing the music in the postoperative period. Although evidence is still limited, results do show that music has a positive effect on the recovery of older patients after surgery. Pain and anxiety are reduced, and relaxation, cognitive functioning, and patient satisfaction increase during postoperative recovery. No negative side effects of music as an intervention were found and therefore seems a non-harming and non-invasive intervention.It seems worthwhile to further explore live music making in music interventions with older hospitalised surgical patients.",

Multivariate analysis identified SMM and operability as significant factors for non-lung cancer mortality. Impact of SMM on lung cancer death was not significant. No difference in rate of severe treatment-related toxicity was observed between the SMM groups.Low SMM is a significant risk factor for non-lung cancer death, which might lead to worse overall survival, after SBRT for stage I NSCLC.

The goal of this study was to assess the relationships between patient fitness/frailty status and survival, and the local tumour immune environment of older patients with breast cancer.In a cohort of 58 older patients with breast cancer (over 70\u202fyears of age), fluorescence microscopy was used to investigate whether levels of intra-tumoural T cells (CD3+) and granulocytic cells (CD15+) could predict clinical outcome, and/or whether they correlated with patient physical and mental performance as evaluated by comprehensive geriatric assessment.We observed that patients with higher levels of intra-tumoural T cells were fitter according to a number of clinical health measures including G8 (p\u202f=\u202f0.006), Karnofsky Index (p\u202f=\u202f0.0372), and Leuven Oncology Frailty Score (LOFS) (p\u202f=\u202f0.0187). In contrast, high relative levels of granulocytic cells were found in patients with poorer clinical health (LOFS, p\u202f=\u202f0.0474). Furthermore, high levels of T cells but not granulocytic cells were associated with longer breast cancer-specific survival (p\u202f=\u202f0.0444).This is the first study to show that low relative levels of intra-tumoural T cells are associated with inferior patient fitness. In contrast to T cells, we observed that intra-tumoural granulocytic cells displayed an inverse relationship with patient performance. Further research is needed to determine whether boosting the level of intra-tumoural T cells in older non-fit patients can result in improved outcome.",

We compared clinical characteristics, treatment and survival between women aged <65 and \u226565\u202fyears of age. Survival analyses were performed for each molecular subtype.851 women (15.5%) were \u226565\u202fyears of age, of which 45% presented with Stages III\u2013IV disease. Compared with their younger counterparts, older women had lower grade disease, a larger proportion of hormone receptor positive tumors, and were less likely to receive both chemotherapy and radiotherapy. At 5\u202fyears, no differences in both disease free and overall survival were found between younger and older women in a multivariate model including stage, grade, tumor subtype and treatment received.In contrast with reports from high-income countries, older women with breast cancer in developing nations present with more advanced disease requiring more aggressive treatment. Strategies aimed at earlier detection, improved access to care, and downstaging among older adults are greatly needed in Mexico and in the rest of the developing world.",

Performance characteristics were calculated for each screening tool based on the outcomes of \u22652 abnormal CGA-domains and \u22651 CGA-based interventions.Discordance between the outcomes was seen in 31.9% of patients. Using the outcome of \u22652 abnormal CGA-domains, the G8 was most sensitive at 0.73 while VES-13 and mFP were both 1.0 specific. Using the outcome of CGA-based interventions the most sensitive tool was still the G8 at 0.64 and the most specific was the mFP at 0.80.All screening tests' performance characteristics for the G8, VES-13 and mFP were lower for the outcome of CGA-based interventions than for the traditional outcome of abnormal CGA-domains. Significant discordance between the outcomes highlights the difficulty with trying to predict which patients will truly benefit from a CGA.",

At the same time it is important to involve the patient and incorporate their preferences. But how can we present and balance the potential downside of radical radiotherapy and risks of unsalvageable recurrence against the potential risks of postoperative morbidity and mortality associated with radical surgery? There are currently no nationally approved and evidence-based guidelines available to ensure consistency in discussions with older adults or frail and vulnerable patients. In this overview we hope to provide an insightful discussion of the relevant issues and options currently available.",

     "abstract": "Older adults with cancer (OACs) are a large and growing population. Psychological distress is prevalent in this population yet few OACs receive evidence-based psychological care. The purpose of this project was to identify barriers and strategies for the implementation of psychological interventions to OACs from the perspective of OACs, OAC caregivers, researchers, clinicians, and advocacy organization members.The Cornell Research-to-Practice (RTP) Consensus Workshop Model was used to organize and convene a consensus conference. The one-day conference consisted of small and large group discussions regarding barriers, facilitators, and strategies for the implementation of psychological interventions targeting OACs. A half-day roundtable meeting was subsequently conducted to organize data generated at the conference. De-identified transcriptions of the small group discussions were uploaded into NVivo 11 software and qualitatively analyzed using standard methods.Thirty-five participants attended the consensus conference from across stakeholder groups. Three themes related to implementation barriers were identified: lack of knowledge about psychological interventions in patients and providers; personal and social factors associated with being an OAC; and institutional-level factors. Themes related to implementation strategies focused on increasing awareness, tailoring interventions for older adults, and modifying institutional-level factors.Effective implementation of psychological interventions to OACs is complex and barriers exist across multiple levels of care. However, this project indicates that implementation can be improved in various ways that include all members of the healthcare system. Further clarification of implementation strategies and rigorous evaluation of their effectiveness is vital to improving care and care outcomes of OACs.",

All reports assessing older patients with cancer care needs in the context of anticancer systemic therapy were reviewed.A total of 357 articles were analyzed. From these, 35 studies were included in the analysis. Compared to younger patients, the elderly had less supportive care needs. While older patients asked for less information than their younger counterparts, they still requested information on diagnosis, seriousness of the disease, chances of cure, spread of the disease, recovery, courses of illness, possible consequences, treatment procedures, treatment options, possible side effects and how to deal with them, and what they could do in daily life. When taking into consideration the various needs as assessed by the \u201cSupportive Care Needs Survey\u201d, physical and daily living were the most frequently reported needs with emphasis on nutrition, coping with physical symptoms, dealing with side effects of treatment, and performing usual physical tasks and activities.Information demand seemed moderate but a great deal of attention was paid to nutrition and well-being.",

SR-MMD was defined as self-reported difficulty or inability to walk a quarter of a mile. Vital status through December 15, 2011 was ascertained from the United States National Center for Health Statistics. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were used to quantify the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) between SR-MMD and mortality.The study included 1458 cancer survivors who averaged 67.1\u202fyears of age. At baseline, 201 (13.7%) participants had SR-MMD. During a median follow-up of 4.7\u202fyears, 434 (29.8%) participants died. SR-MMD was independently associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality [HR: 2.15 (95% CI: 1.56\u20132.97); P\u202f<\u202f0.001] and cancer-specific mortality [HR: 2.49 (95% CI: 1.53\u20134.07); P\u202f<\u202f0.001]. The association between SR-MMD and all-cause mortality was not modified by age, sex, time since cancer diagnosis, body mass index, or comorbid health conditions.SR-MMD is an easily ascertainable metric of physical function that is associated with a higher risk of mortality among cancer survivors. Integrating measures of physical function may help to guide clinical decision-making and improve long-term prognostication in this population. Interventions that prevent the development of SR-MDD, such as physical activity, should be evaluated in this population.",

     "abstract": "To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a tailored endovesical immunotherapy protocol with biweekly BCG for elderly Patients with high risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer (HG-NMIBC).We retrospectively evaluated data from 200 patients older than 80\u202fyears newly diagnosed with HG-NMIBC: 100 (group 1) with multiple comorbidities (WHO PS 2\u20133, ASA score \u22653, Charlson Comorbidity index \u22653, GFR<60\u202fmL/min) were treated with BCG induction course administered biweekly; 100 (group 2) with statistically significant better conditions were treated with standard weekly BCG therapy. After the induction treatment disease-free patients underwent to at least one year of BCG maintenance therapy. Endpoints were: initial response to BCG, cancer-free survival and rate of progression at 2\u202fyears, rate of complications.No statistically significant differences were found in terms of initial response to BCG (69% in Group 1 vs 71% in Group 2, P\u202f=\u202f0.75), cancer free survival (57% vs 55% respectively, P\u202f=\u202f0.77) and rate of progression (20% vs 14% respectively, P\u202f=\u202f0.26) at 2\u202fyears. The difference in the rate of overall complications was statistically significant (15% in Group 1 vs 27% in Group 2, P\u202f=\u202f0.03), in the rate of severe complications was not statistically significant (5% in Group 1 vs 7% in Group 2, P\u202f=\u202f0.61).A tailored regimen of BCG administration is possible and safe in frail elderly patients, limiting side effects and risk of undertreatment but maintaining oncological outcomes. Preliminary results in a small patients group are promising but larger randomized studies are needed to confirm our data.",

Subsequently 232 patients were treated with sunitinib after imatinib failure. We have analyzed the outcomes of patients who have been treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor at the age\u202f\u2265\u202f70\u202fyears and compared to control group of patients younger than 70\u202fyears old.In the group of patients treated with imatinib, 139 (21%) started therapy at the age of at least 70\u202fyears (median age of the entire cohort: 60). Median progression-free survival (PFS) on 1st line imatinib did not differ between patients \u226570\u202fyo (years old) and\u202f<\u202f70yo (38.5 vs 44.9\u202fmonths), but median overall survival (OS) was significantly better for younger patients (81\u202fmonths vs. 50; p\u202f=\u202f0.0001; although disease-specific survival - DSS was similar). Distribution of primary tumor mutational status was generally similar in older and younger patients. Permanent dose reduction (300\u2013100\u202fmg/day) was required for 23 patients (16.9%) in the older group and was significantly more frequent as compared to younger patients (5%). Drug-related adverse events were mainly of grades 1/2, but grade 3/4 toxicity occurred more frequently in older (14.7%) than in younger patients (3.8%). Similarly in group of patients treated with second-line sunitinib median PFS and DSS were comparable in groups of patients \u226570\u202fyo (n\u202f=\u202f55) and\u202f<\u202f70yo (9.7\u202fmonths vs 10.3\u202fmonths; p\u202f=\u202f0.7, and 21.5 vs 22.9\u202fmonths). >40% of patients in both groups required dose adjustments to 37.5\u201325\u202fmg daily.Our study confirms that current therapy of advanced GIST with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (both in 1st and 2nd line) in older patients enable to achieve the similar disease control rate and final outcomes as in younger patients, but it demands close cooperation of experienced oncologist with patients for dose modifications and side effects management. Limitation of our study is that the patients did not undergo a comprehensive geriatric assessment, what might be helpful for personalized management of patients. Nevertheless, we confirm that older patients with GIST should not receive less treatment irrespective of comorbidities.",

Historically, effective treatment options were not available for older CML patients ineligible for curative allogeneic stem cell transplant, and the disease was therefore usually fatal within several years of diagnosis. The development of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that effectively target the constitutively active mutant tyrosine kinase in CML has dramatically improved outcomes for all patients with CML, including older patients. While older patients were underrepresented in prospective trials, TKI therapy can be successfully administered to older adults with CML with excellent efficacy and proven tolerability. TKI selection and monitoring for adverse events should be tailored based on co-morbidities. As with younger patients, life expectancy of older adults with CML now approaches that of age-matched controls. Here we review guidelines for management of older adults with CML.",

Older adults with ALL are heterogeneous in terms of their underlying health status, which can make treatment selection challenging given the disease rarity and limited inclusion of older patients in clinical trials. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a compilation of tools to assess multiple domains such as physical function and cognition, and may assist in guiding treatment selection and supportive care interventions. However, studies on the use of CGA are limited in older adults with ALL. In this review, we discuss the utility of CGA in patients with various hematologic malignancies.

Treatment of MDS focuses on supportive care, with disease-modifying approaches (chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation) reserved for fit patients with high-risk disease.

The panel concluded by consensus that the following domains should be included in the CGA:(and the scales to evaluate them): functional (Barthel Index, Lawton-Brody scale, gait speed), cognitive (Pfeiffer questionnaire), nutritional (Mini Nutritional Assessment \u2013 MNA), psychological/mood (Yesavage scale), social-familial (Gijon scale), comorbidity (Charlson index), medications, and geriatric syndromes (urinary and/or fecal incontinence, low auditory and/or visual acuity, presence of falls, pressure sores, insomnia, and abuse). Also by consensus, the CGA should be administered to older patients with cancer for whom there is a subsequent therapeutic intent and who scored positive on a previous frailty-screening questionnaire.After 3 rounds, consensus was reached regarding CGA domains to be used in older patients with cancer, the scales to be administered for each of these domains, as well as the timeline to be followed during consultation.",

Addressing GP and their RT needs is an important issue in order to understand this heterogeneous group of patients.A descriptive cross-sectional study, using a convenience sample from Sulaimani city's inhabitants, aged 70-year and more, who were treated with RT at the only city's RT center, Zhianawa Cancer Center (ZCC), in 2015.153 patients' charts were reviewed. GP represented 20% of the patients referred to ZCC. Male: Female ratio was 3:1. One third presented with distant metastases, and 46% were treated with curative intent versus 54% with palliative intent. 94% completed the planned sessions of the curative RT vs 90% of the palliative RT. 23% of GP who were referred for RT didn't receive it. 9% got interruptions during RT course. 10% of GP living >40\u202fkm away from the treatment center refused treatment. Mean time interval between the date of referral and the date of starting treatment in the palliative setting was 19\u202fdays. Only 41% of patients with curative setting had regular follow-up.Being the 1st study in this regard in a war-torn nation, Iraq, our results demonstrated that GP is a sizable group of ZCC patients and that RT is a valuable modality in GP cancer treatment. \u201cAge per se\u201d is not a factor to avoid this modality when there is an indication to use it. Longer distance to reach the center was a challenge in some of our GP. Due to inadequate number of RT machines, GP have to wait long time before getting their RT, even for palliative purposes. Further studies in this field are warranted.",

Although surgical complications and functional status are recognized as independent factors for halting adjuvant therapy in patients that undergo pancreatic resections, other elements may play a role in deciding which patients get treated postoperatively. Here we determined demographic and clinical characteristics of patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy, with the primary intent to investigate if age alone affects rates of adjuvant therapy.National Cancer Database (NCDB) was queried for patients that underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer. Groups were divided into: adjuvant chemotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a017,924) and no adjuvant chemotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a012,947). Basic demographics and treatment characteristics were analyzed. Age was compared with an independent means test; other comparisons used Chi-square test of independence.There was a statistical difference in age (adjuvant therapy 64.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.89 vs. no therapy 67.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011.22, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), insurance type, facility type, and cancer stage for patients that received adjuvant therapy and those that did not. Average age of patients not receiving chemotherapy was significantly older at each pathologic stage. Subset analysis of patients treated with chemotherapy showed that the majority of patients received single agent regimens (62%), at an average of 59\u00a0days following surgery, and at academic cancer programs (52%).Regardless of postoperative complications and functional status, age alone appears to affect rates of adjuvant therapy in patients with resected pancreatic cancer. Older patients should be offered tailored regimens that would allow them to complete the intended extent of treatment.",

The patients underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment before therapeutic decision in a multidisciplinary team meeting. We analyzed factors independently associated with all-cause mortality with Cox survival analysis.Seventy-three patients (median age\u202f=\u202f77.9\u202fyears) were prospectively included. Among them, 42 patients underwent surgery whereas the 31 other patients not eligible for surgical treatment received chemotherapy (n\u202f=\u202f22) or best supportive care alone (n\u202f=\u202f9). Almost 62% of operated patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. In the non-surgical group, a mean of 9 cycles of palliative chemotherapy per patients were administrated. Median overall survival was 21.3\u202fmonths in the surgical group and 6.1\u202fmonths in the palliative group (p\u202f=\u202f0.0001).

Optimal care of the older adult with cancer requires the involvement of many types of health care providers, including oncologists, nurses, primary care practitioners, and geriatricians. In this narrative review, the literature for evidence relating to the roles of and collaboration between geriatricians, primary care practitioners, nurses, and the oncology team during cancer treatment delivery to older adults was examined. Relevant abstracts were reviewed by all team members. The full texts were reviewed to identify common themes related to roles and collaboration. The results showed that primary care practitioners felt underutilized and that the communication and collaboration between oncologists and primary care practitioners is challenging due to lack of clarity about roles and lack of timely communication/sharing of all relevant information. Furthermore, some of oncology staff, but not all, saw a need for greater collaboration between oncologists and geriatricians. The lack of availability of geriatricians limited the collaboration. Geriatric oncology nurses perceived themselves as having an important role in geriatric assessment and management, but there was no data on their collaboration with these medical specialists. There is a clear need for improvement of collaboration to improve patient outcomes. In conclusion, further research is needed to examine the impact of geriatric oncology team collaboration on the quality of cancer care, in particular, the role of nurses in supporting quality of care during treatment.",

     "abstract": "Managing older patients with head and neck cancers poses a challenge due to the often reduced levels of physiological reserve, the frequent comorbidities and treatment related toxicity. These factors have implications on speech, breathing and swallowing functions. Treatment management plans in these patients may result in de-intensification strategies and as a result of this, use of non-standard treatments is increasing. There have been published reports that indicate the addition of concurrent systemic therapy to radiation in selected older patients is feasible, and produces outcomes comparable with younger patients. However, some other studies including meta-analyses suggest a lack of real survival benefit with the addition of chemotherapy. So, the key point appears to be the optimal patient selection. Appropriate geriatric and frailty assessments are required to help determine the optimal treatment for older patients with head and neck cancer. Treatment for this population still needs to be well defined and optimized in both modality and intensity.Qualitative studies are also required to address short and long-term post-treatment quality-of-life and survivorship issues in this specific patient population.

     "abstract": "Cancer and impaired cognition are both frequent conditions in old age and consequently coexist to certain degree. The prevalence of impaired cognition increases sharply after the age of 65 and the more advanced form of cognitive impairment; dementia, is exceeding 30% by the age of 85\u00a0years. Adequate cognition is crucial for understanding important facts and for giving consent for intervention. There are many different stages of cognitive impairment, ranging from subjective cognitive impairment to severe dementia. The mildest stages of cognitive impairment are sometimes reversible but in more severe stages, there is brain damage of some kind, most frequently caused by neurodegenerative disorder such as Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, some kind of evaluation of cognition should be offered to all older individuals with cancer and in need for intervention. In this evaluation, information should also be sought from a close relative. In the earlier stages of cognitive impairment, the individual usually retains ability to give consent and understands information given but in later stages of dementia, a surrogate decision maker is needed. In milder stages of dementia, an individual evaluation is needed for decision of capability for consent. A specific diagnosis of a disorder such as Alzheimer's disease does not in itself preclude the individual from giving consent, the degree of cognitive impairment, impaired judgement and poor insight are more decisive in this regard. It is also important to know the difference of delirium, most often a time limited condition and dementia that usually is progressive.",

Multivariable logistic regression models assessed associations of survivors' sociodemographic and clinical characteristics with care experience.Among 19,455 cancer survivors with SEER-CAHPS data, higher self-reported general-health status was significantly associated with better care experiences for breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors. In contrast, better mental-health status was associated with better care experience for lung cancer survivors. College-educated and Asian survivors were less likely to indicate high scores for care experiences. Few differences in survivors' experiences were observed by sex or years since diagnosis.The SEER-CAHPS data resources allows assessment of factors influencing experience of cancer among U.S. cancer survivors. Higher self-reported health status was associated with better experiences of care; other survivors' characteristics also predicted care experience.

     "abstract": "To examine the associations of comorbidity and chemotherapy with breast cancer- and non-breast cancer-related death.Included were women with invasive locoregional breast cancer diagnosed in 2004 from seven population-based cancer registries. Data were abstracted from medical records and verified with treating physicians when there were inconsistencies and missing information on cancer treatment. Comorbidity severity was quantified using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation 27. Treatment guideline concordance was determined by comparing treatment received with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. Kaplan\u2013Meier method and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regressions were employed for statistical analyses.Of 5852 patients, 76% were under 70\u00a0years old and 69% received guideline concordant adjuvant chemotherapy. Comorbidity was more prevalent in women age 70 and older (79% vs. 51%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). After adjusting for tumor characteristics and treatment, severe comorbidity burden was associated with significantly higher cancer-related mortality in older patients (Hazard Ratio [HR]\u00a0=\u00a02.38, 95% CI 1.08\u20135.24), but not in younger patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.78, 95% CI 0.87\u20133.64). Among patients receiving guideline adjuvant chemotherapy, cancer-related mortality was significantly higher in older patients (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.35, 95% CI 1.52\u20133.62), and those with severe comorbidity (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.79, 95% CI 1.72\u20138.33).Findings suggest that, compared to women with no comorbidity, patients with breast cancer age 70 and older with severe comorbidity are at increased risk of dying from breast cancer, even after adjustment for adjuvant chemotherapy and other tumor and treatment differences. This information adds to risk\u2013benefit discussions and emphasizes the need for further study of the role for adjuvant chemotherapy in these patient groups.",

A subset of 145 patients completed a questionnaire to describe chemotherapy preference pre-treatment. The association of this pre-treatment preference with the patient's perception of self-health, predicted and actual QoL, patient- and professional-reported toxicity, mental health, self-rated function, and survival was studied during and after treatment.The median age of patients was 71\u202fyears and 47% had a high preference for chemotherapy.

Barriers included health issues (43%), particularly cancer treatment side effects such as fatigue. Facilitators included religious faith (38%) and family (50%). Preferences included group exercise (97%) and strength training (80%) due to concerns participants had with diminished upper body strength after cancer treatment. Although AA (59%) and SES non-disadvantaged (78%) participants reported that race and culture influenced their attitudes toward PA, it did not translate to racial and SES differences in preferences.Among older BCS, physical activity preferences were shaped by cancer experience, rather than by race and SES.

Therefore, in this retrospective study, we compared the outcomes of ESD for laterally spreading tumors (LST) \u2265\u00a03\u00a0cm(cm) in older patients to that in younger patients.Consecutive patients with LSTs 3\u00a0cm or larger were enrolled for from May 2010\u20132016. These patients were divided into two groups: the younger group (<\u00a065\u00a0years) and the older group (\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years). The clinicopathologic findings and the outcomes of ESD procedures were compared between the two groups.A total of 70 patients in the younger group and 73 patients in the older group were treated by ESD for colorectal LSTs larger than 3\u00a0cm. No significant differences were observed in the gender ratio, tumor morphological type, tumor location, and tumor size between the two groups. The en bloc resection rates were 85.7 and 89.0%, respectively, without a significant difference. The procedural time was similar between the younger and older patients (71.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a034.7\u00a0min vs. 70.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a029.5\u00a0min).

A statistical analysis was conducted to prove non-inferiority for overall survival (OS) associated with the use of chemotherapy schedules in individuals \u2265\u00a070 vs.<70\u00a0years. The fixed-margin method was used (hazard ratio [HR]<1.176) that corresponds to conserving at least 85% efficacy. Results: 33% (n\u00a0=\u00a0489) of the cases analyzed were \u2265\u00a070 years. Two-agent chemotherapies and combinations with oxaliplatin (48% vs. 29%) were used more often in the older patients, as were modified schedules and/or lower doses. Toxicity grade 3\u20134 was comparable in both groups, although when looking at any grade, there were more episodes of enteritis, renal toxicity, and fatigue in older patients. In addition, toxicity was a frequent cause for discontinuing treatment in older patients. The response rate was similar in both groups. After adjusting for confounding factors, the non-inferiority of OS associated with schedules administered to the older vs. younger subjects was confirmed: HR 1.02 (90% CI, 0.91\u20131.14), P (non inferiority)\u00a0=\u00a00.018, as well as progression-free survival: HR 0.97 (90% CI, 0.87\u20131.08), P(non-inferiority)\u00a0=\u00a00.001.In this AGC registry, the use of chemotherapy with schedules adapted to patients \u2265\u00a070 years provided efficacy that was not inferior to that seen in younger cases, with comparable adverse effects.",

Compared to younger patients, older patients underwent significantly more often short-course radiation with delayed surgery (6.1% and 19.1% respectively) and less often chemoradiation (62.6% and 39.1% respectively), and were more likely to undergo a Hartmann procedure with permanent stoma (3.5% and 13.0% respectively) instead of sphincter-sparing surgery (43.9% and 29.6% respectively). Postoperative complication rates were similar (38.5% in older patients versus 34.7% in younger patients). Older patients had worse physical functioning at six and twelve months after diagnosis compared to younger patients. Presence of postoperative complications had a significant stronger impact on physical- and role functioning in older patients.Older patients undergo more often a tailored treatment approach for rectal cancer than younger patients.

In a survival analysis, D2 LN dissection did not improve overall survival (OS) in any patient, including advanced cases. A Cox regression analysis revealed that the independent risk factors for OS were history of coronary artery disease (hazard ratio [HR], 11.095), postoperative short-term complications (HR, 9.939), and TNM stage (HR, 6.299). The extent of LN dissection was not an independent risk factor for OS, and D2 or more LN dissection (odds ratio, 10.89) increased the risk independently.D2 or more LN dissection did not improve survival, but rather increased the risk of complications. Thus, LN dissection should be performed sparingly in octogenarian patients with gastric cancer.",

This study projects cancer trends in the elderly population in Lebanon, a country experiencing accelerating aging trends. Findings will guide future policy decisions regarding geriatric oncology in Lebanon and the surrounding Arab world.Cancer incidence rates were derived for men and women 65\u00a0years and above, divided into three age groups: 65\u201369\u00a0years, 70\u201374\u00a0years, and 75\u00a0years and above. Raw data were obtained from the National Cancer Registry reports 2003\u20132010. The eight consecutive year data were used to project the incidence until 2025 using a logarithmic model. The Average Annual Percent Change in incidence rates was calculated to determine whether it would significantly increase, decrease, or remain stable over time.Incidence rates are projected to increase significantly in all age groups of both genders until 2025. In men, the fastest rise is expected in prostate cancer, followed by bladder, lung, colorectal, and NHL. In women, the rise will be fastest in breast, followed by colorectal, lung, NHL, and ovary. Projected rates increase faster in the \u201cyounger\u201d age group 65\u201369 compared to the \u201coldest\u201d \u2265\u00a075, both in men and women.

The nomograms were developed based on multivariate analysis and evaluated. We performed the external validation and calibration of the risk calculators from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT).The present study included 302 subjects with a median age of 78\u00a0years (range: 75\u201391\u00a0years).

The ratio of free-to-total PSA, prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) were used to develop the PCa-predicting nomogram, and PSAD, TRUS, and PI-RADS were used to develop the HGPCa-predicting nomogram. The area under the curve (AUC) values of PCa-predicting and HGPCa-predicting nomograms were 0.90 and 0.87. The ERSPC calculator had acceptable external calibration and validation outcomes. We recommended a cut-off probability of 42% for PCa-predicting nomogram when used in healthy older men to achieve a sensitivity of 95.6%, and a cut-off probability of 73% for HGPCa-predicting nomogram when used in vulnerable older men to achieve a specificity of 98.3%.The present nomograms could help discriminate patients with PCa from healthy elder adults for standard treatment, and discriminate patients with HGPCa from vulnerable elder adults for modified treatment.

This study evaluates a modified frailty index (mFI) in predicting overall survival (OS) and non-cancer death for Stage I/II [N0M0] Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT).Medical records for all patients with Stage I/II NSCLC treated at our institution with SBRT from 2009 to 2014 were reviewed. A validated mFI score, consisting of 11 variables was calculated, classifying patients as non-frail (0\u20131) or frail (\u2265\u00a02). Primary endpoint (OS) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank. Secondary endpoint, non-cancer death, was analyzed using Fine-Gray's method, with death from lung cancer as a competing risk.Patient cohort consisted of 38 (27.3%) non-frail and 101 (72.7%) frail [median total mFI score 3.0 (range 0\u20137)]. Median age and pack-year history was 74 and 46\u00a0years, respectively. Median follow-up among survivors was 38.5\u00a0months (range 4.0\u201374.1\u00a0months). Frailty was associated with a lower 3-year OS (37.3% vs. 74.7%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.003) and 3-year cumulative incidence of non-cancer death (36.7% vs. 12.5%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

The aim of this work was to identify sociodemographic, socioeconomic, clinical, and care-related determinants of survival or mortality in older patients with cancer by a systematic synthesis of the literature. Understanding these factors is of great value for guiding health policies and programs aimed at reducing cancer survival disparities.We conducted a search of MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases under PRISMA guidelines. Results were limited to articles published in English and French from 2005 to 2015, and focused on elderly patients with cancer. The article selection was performed in a stepwise fashion: title, abstract, and full-text selection. Studied determinants and results of each article were synthesized. Forty-five articles were eligible and included in the study. We observed different ways of measuring socioeconomic status, comorbidities, and treatment among studies. Cancer-specific and overall survival were the main studied outcomes. Advanced age, low income, low socioeconomic status, presence of comorbidities, advanced stage, and poor tumor grade were found to be associated with lower survival or higher mortality. On the other hand, female gender and being married were predictive of increased survival or lower mortality.The next logical step is to carry out studies on elderly patients from different countries and to incorporate pertinent factors in a unique model. Moreover, specific geriatric health impairments should be taken into account in further research because of their association with survival.",

Neoadjuvant chemoradiation was associated with lower 30-day readmission rates (5% vs. 8%; OR\u00a0=\u00a00.48, 95%CI [0.31\u20130.73], p\u00a0=\u00a00.004) and shorter surgical hospital stay (median 10 vs. 12\u00a0days, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to esophagectomy alone.In older patients with esophageal cancer, trimodality therapy, compared to esophagectomy alone, is associated with improved overall survival and favorable pathologic and perioperative outcomes. Further studies are needed to identify which older patients are most suitable for trimodality therapy.",

A 36-item Carolina Frailty Index was calculated. Cross-sectional skeletal muscle area (SMA) and Skeletal Muscle Density (SMD) were analyzed from CT scan L3 lumbar segments. SMA and patient height (m2) were used to calculate skeletal muscle index (SMI). Skeletal Muscle Gauge (SMG) was calculated by multiplying SMI\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0SMD.Of the 162 patients, mean age 73, 53% were robust, 27% pre-frail, and 21% frail. Significant differences were found between robust and frail patients for SMD (29.4 vs 24.1 HU, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and SMG (1188 vs 922\u00a0AU, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), but not SMI (41.9 vs 39.5\u00a0cm2/m2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.29). After controlling for age and gender, for every 5 unit decrease in SMD, the prevalence ratio of frailty increased by 20% (PR\u00a0=\u00a01.20 [1.09, 1.32]) while the prevalence of frailty did not differ based on SMI.Muscle mass (measured as SMI) was poorly associated with a GA-based frailty index. Muscle density, which reflects muscle lipid content, was more associated with frailty. Although frailty and loss of muscle mass are both age-related conditions that are predictive of adverse outcomes, our results suggest they are separate entities.",

Limited data suggest that older patients are as likely to benefit from surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy as younger patients. The only potentially curative approach for pancreatic cancer is surgery but this is only performed in less than 20% of patients considered resectable. With improvements in surgical techniques, older patients without major comorbidities show a course of disease after resection similar to that of younger patients. The use of adjuvant chemotherapy in an attempt to prolong survival is therefore reasonable for this population of patients. Historically, patients with locally-advanced disease will be offered gemcitabine as standard chemotherapy, with radiotherapy considered at a later time. In the majority, metastatic patients will preferably be offered gemcitabine chemotherapy, which can be used at a lower dose in frail or very old patients. In some cases in patients in a very good health condition, two recent intensive chemotherapies can be proposed with modified doses and a close follow-up: the 5-fluoroucil, leucovorin, irinotecan, oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) regimen and the combination of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel. For older patients with terminal disease and palliative needs, which is the majority of cases, better use of pain control and palliative measures can be beneficial.

     "abstract": "Radiotherapy is an attractive treatment option for older adults, especially where surgery and chemotherapy pose too great a risk. Radiotherapy toxicity may be divided into acute/early and late effects of treatment. The latter may have limited relevance to an older patient with competing causes of mortality due to significant comorbidity. Altered fractionation regimes have been employed in numerous sites, with no significant toxicity impact. These offer greater convenience in the elderly, especially those with limited social support or in active caregiving roles. As radiotherapy toxicity is site specific, it's important to assess baseline function via Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA), and any pre-existing comorbidities that may influence toxicity. With modern radiotherapy technology and capabilities, these are less of an issue and radiotherapy is a very suitable treatment option for the older adult. When evaluating the literature on toxicity in older patients, it's important to recognise that older studies do not represent modern day radiotherapy techniques and capabilities. Advanced technology may simultaneously deliver enhanced target coverage and reduced toxicity. More research is required related to the predictive power of CGA in linking radiotherapy toxicity to frailty. What little evidence exists shows that CGA has a role in treatment of older patients with radiotherapy and that, in general, radiotherapy appears to be well tolerated in older adults. The purpose of this review is to provide a broad overview of the mechanisms of normal tissue reactions to radiotherapy and how radiation induced toxicity may affect older patients.",

The older oncology patient is not part of a homogenous group; chronological age poorly describes the health status of an individual. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) identifies domains, assessed by a multidisciplinary team, that should be considered to guide appropriate oncological treatment decisions. This paper will focus on two aspects of the CGA: the assessment of nutrition and functional status of the older patient with cancer. Optimization of both diet and physical activity may help patients improve their tolerance to oncological treatments and health-related quality of life (HRQOL).

Though the commercial and recreational use of new technology has increased in older individuals, the transition into creating a smart and connected home that can interface with both patients and healthcare professionals is in its early phases. Current limitations include an inherent digital divide, as well as concerns regarding privacy, data volume, rapid change, cost and reimbursement. The emergence of low-cost, high-fidelity wearable sensors with a spectrum of clinical utility may be the key to increased use and adaptation by older adults.

ECSs with comorbidity reported significantly more I-ADL-problems than controls with comorbidity, and ECSs with comorbidity had significantly more I-ADL-problems than ECSs without comorbidity.Our results reflect common factors found in ADL studies in the elderly population. Health personnel have to be particularly observant on I-ADL problems among female ECSs, and those reporting poor self-rated health or comorbidity.",

     "abstract": "To date, most comorbidity studies have analyzed either a subgroup of frequent diseases, or used summary instruments such as the Charlson score or the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G). Yet, comorbidity is a multidimensional construct and impacts function, treatment tolerance, and survival. We assessed how heat maps can unveil specific patterns of comorbidities associated with overall survival (OS) in older cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.We reviewed four trials that prospectively evaluated comorbidities using CIRS-G. Eligible patients were 65\u00a0years or older and had solid tumors with 30 or more patients per tumor site. Heat maps were constructed based on CIRS-G scores and correlated with OS.Among 818 patients accrued, 399 were eligible: Median follow-up was 53.4\u00a0months and median OS was 19.6\u00a0months (95% CI: 16.5\u201324.2). In the univariate model for OS, patients with a severe CIRS-G score in 6 organ categories (3\u20134 in heart, hematopoietic, respiratory, and musculoskeletal-integument and 2\u20134 in upper GI and liver) had statistically worse OS than those with lower scores. According to a total risk score (TRS) based on hazard ratios for OS, OS of the low risk group (N\u00a0=\u00a0309, TRS\u00a0<\u00a02) was significantly higher (24.3\u00a0m vs. 10.8\u00a0m, HR\u00a0=\u00a02.05, 95% CI: 1.58\u20132.66). TRS was a predictor for OS independently from stage, primary site, prior chemotherapy, ECOG performance status, and IADL (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.94, 95% CI: 1.47\u20132.57).High TRS was a predictor of poor survival. Comorbidity heat maps appear promising to identify diseases most affecting the OS of older cancer patients.",

In very elderly patients, previous studies have shown SBRT to offer excellent local control, though with higher toxicities than in younger populations. We report our institutional experience using SBRT in the definitive management of NSCLC in patients \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years old.Using an IRB-approved registry of 158 patients treated with definitive-intent lung SBRT for early-stage NSCLC at our institution between 2010 and 2016, 31 consecutively treated patients \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years of age were identified. CTCAEv4 scales were prospectively recorded during follow-ups and utilized for toxicity assessments. Kaplan\u2013Meier estimates were utilized for survival analyses.For the 31 patients (with 34 lesions) included, median age was 83 (R: 80\u201393), median ECOG performance status was 2 (R: 0\u20133), and median follow-up was 15.8\u00a0months (R: 3.1\u201348.3). Median PTV size was 24.0\u00a0cm3 (R: 5.83\u201362.1\u00a0cm3). Median prescription dose was 54Gy in 3 fractions (R: 50-60Gy in 3\u20138 fractions). Local control was 100% at 1\u00a0year and 92.3% at 2\u00a0years. Median survival was 29.1\u00a0months. There were no grade 2\u20135 toxicities. Grade 1 toxicities included: fatigue in 5 patients (16.1%), asymptomatic (radiographic) pneumonitis in 12 (38.7%), and dyspnea in 2 (6.5%).Lung SBRT with a BED of \u2265\u00a0100Gy10 for very elderly patients with NSCLC is extremely safe and effective, with inordinately low toxicity rates (zero grade 2\u20135 toxicities). With stringent dosimetric parameters and planning guidelines, patients \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years remain excellent candidates for full-dose SBRT.SBRT for early-stage NSCLC is the accepted standard of care in medically inoperable patients, though in many very elderly patients, dose is either de-intensified or withheld for concern of toxicity in the setting of advanced age and competing risks. In this study of our very elderly (\u2265\u00a080\u00a0years old) early-stage NSCLC patients, we highlight both the extremely high efficacy and tolerability (zero grade 2 or above toxicities) associated with definitive intent SBRT.",

In hematologic patients, both disease and its treatment, including chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT), can cause anemia, febrile neutropenia, and bleeding tendency, which may result in falls and fall-related injuries.We retrospectively analyzed 397 consecutive admissions to the hematology unit at our institute which included 201 adult patients with hematologic disease.A total of 56 fall events were observed in 43 patients, and the incidence of falls was 2.49 per 1000 person-days. The median hemoglobin, platelet, and serum albumin levels prior to fall events were 8.65\u00a0g/dl (range, 6.3\u201312.7), 38\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0109/l (range, 7\u2013454), and 2.85\u00a0g/dl (range, 1.6\u20134.3), respectively.

Qualitative analytic techniques were used to extract salient themes and conduct a comparative analysis of the two groups.Four salient themes emerged\u20141) knowledge acquisition, 2) decision-making style, 3) decision-making about timing of HT, and 4) anxiety-coping mechanisms. A comparative analysis showed that patients receiving the DA intervention had a better comprehension of Prostate-specific antigen (PSA), an improved understanding of HT treatment implications, an external locus-of-control, participation in shared decision-making and, support-seeking for anxiety reduction. In contrast, SoC patients displayed worse comprehension of PSA testing and HT treatment implications, internal locus-of-control, unilateral involvement in knowledge-seeking and decision-making, and no support-seeking for anxiety-coping.The DA was more effective than the SoC group in helping PCa patients understand the full implications of PSA testing and treatment; motivating shared decision-making, and support-seeking for anxiety relief. DA DVD interventions can be a useful patient education tool for bringing higher quality decision-making to prostate cancer care.",

The number of older adults is rapidly growing, leading to an increase in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases associated with aging, such as cancer. Worldwide, older adults account for approximately half of all cancer cases, and this proportion is projected to increase globally. Furthermore, the majority of older adults live in less developed regions, where health systems are generally ill-equipped to provide care for complex chronic conditions. Worldwide, there is paucity of geriatric training, and most of the oncology workforce lacks the skills and knowledge to provide comprehensive care for older patients. Various initiatives aimed at providing adequate clinical care for older adults, increasing the geriatric skills and knowledge of healthcare professionals, and developing geriatric oncology research, have been successfully implemented. However, most developments in geriatric oncology have taken place in high-income countries, and there are still large inequalities in the availability of clinical, educational, and research initiatives across different regions of the world. This article provides an overview of geriatric oncology initiatives in Asia, Europe, Australia and New Zealand, Latin America, and the United States and Canada. Understanding the achievements and challenges of geriatric oncology around the world, and fostering international collaboration in research and training are essential for improving the care of all older adults with cancer.",

FAE were defined as one or more claims suggestive of functional impairment within 24\u00a0months following chemotherapy including claims for durable medical equipment and skilled care. Women who did not receive chemotherapy were weighted to reflect the covariate distribution of chemotherapy recipients using propensity score weighting for age, stage, baseline healthcare utilization, and comorbidities.The cohort included 44,626 patients, 6892 (15%) received chemotherapy. 19% of the population experienced \u2265\u00a01 FAE. After propensity weighting, chemotherapy was associated with a small increased risk of FAEs (HR 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.04, 1.20). Results were similar in patients 75\u00a0years and older versus younger patients. In the chemotherapy group, the highest risk of FAE occurred in the first 3\u00a0months, but persisted through follow-up.Exposure to chemotherapy was associated with a small increased risk of FAE which did not vary by age.

Propensity score matching (for receipt of localized treatment) was performed considering baseline characteristics (age, gender, race, tumor (T) stage, tumor size, fibrosis score, alpha fetoprotein level and histological subtype).A total of 6693 patients were identified. The median age group was 75\u201380\u00a0years, and 2457 patients received local treatment (either surgical or non-surgical treatment). Both before and after propensity score matching, cancer-specific and overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for all) were better in the local treatment group. When stratifying the overall survival according to age group (70\u201380\u00a0years vs. >\u00a080\u00a0years) in the post matching cohort, patients treated with local treatment have better overall survival than those not treated regardless of the age group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for both groups). In multivariate analysis of the matched population: local treatment, normal AFP and age (70\u201380\u00a0years) were associated with better overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, P\u00a0=\u00a00.047; respectively).Within the known limitations of the current SEER analysis, it may be cautiously suggested that elderly patients with early HCC should be properly selected for potentially curative local therapies.

Our primary aim was to examine the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) as a predictor of toxicity in patients over 70\u00a0years undergoing radical radiotherapy for any malignant diagnosis.63 patients were recruited: 29% experienced grade 3 or greater toxicities, with very few having multiple grade 3 or greater toxicities. The majority of patients experienced multiple grade 1 or 2 toxicities. Patients were often admitted: either electively due to geographical reasons, or due to toxicities. All patients completed their courses of radiotherapy. All grade 3 or 4 toxicities occurred within five radiotherapy sites; upper GI, gynaecological, lung, prostate and head & neck. There was no statistical correlation between EFS score and the presence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities.This study showed that neither EFS score, age nor ECOG performance status were predictive of radiotherapy toxicity, breaks in treatment or hospital admissions. Patients with oesophageal cancer, gynaecological cancers and lung cancer had a high rate of toxicity and hospital admission, which may highlight the need for additional patient support in these groups. Whilst comprehensive geriatric assessment is recommended, further research is needed to conclude if the frail elderly patient is at greater risk of toxicities from radiotherapy, and which geriatric assessment tool may be the most helpful.",

There are limited data on the specific psycho-oncological problems in elderly patients with genito-urinary cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the psychosocial needs of elderly patients with genito-urinary tumors using screening questionnaires and to use such screening questionnaires for an in-patient psychosocial treatment program.Patients (\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years, n\u00a0=\u00a0319) who underwent surgical (n\u00a0=\u00a0295) or medical treatment (n\u00a0=\u00a024) for genito-urinary malignancies between 06/2014 and 11/2015 in our institution were included for prospective stress assessment. This was done with standardized questionnaires for stress screening and for the identification of need for care (NCCN Distress Thermometer and Hornheider Screening Instrument, HSI).The patients scored an average of 4.4 on the Distress Thermometer. According to the survey evaluation, 28% of patients had need for psychosocial care. However, only a minority of patients (4%) did actually communicate any need for psychosocial care. We also assessed the actual utilization of inpatient psychosocial support which is offered to all patients.There is a significant number of elderly patients with genito-urinary cancer with increased psychological stress and a consecutive need of psychosocial care. This is underreported and underused by the patients. Therefore, an easy low-threshold access system with an interdisciplinary and inter-professional collaborative support system would be desirable. Measuring psychological distress systematically can be helpful in treating older patients with malignant diseases.",

Current available data do not suggest significant age-associated differences in the clinical profile of ICIs.

     "abstract": "\u201cIs my older cancer patient on too many medications?\u201d is a question that confronts many physicians. Increasing age is associated with an increase in comorbidity, and consequently an increase in the number of medications prescribed to provide symptomatic relief and prevent disease related sequelae. The use of multiple medications, often termed polypharmacy, is highly prevalent in older people with cancer. Polypharmacy is not necessarily inappropriate but has been associated with drug\u2013drug interactions, use of potentially inappropriate medications and a range of adverse events. Specific medications for which the risks outweigh the benefits are considered inappropriate, particularly when safer alternatives exist. Additionally, the appropriateness of medication therapy for both cancer and non-cancer indications is dependent on a patient's life expectancy and treatment goals. A range of implicit and explicit tools are available to assist clinicians work as part of a multidisciplinary team to identify inappropriate or unnecessary medications. Inappropriate or unnecessary medications can be targeted for cessation. Deprescribing is the patient-centered process of reducing medications after consideration of treatment goals, benefits and risks, and medical ethics. A six step process for deprescribing in older patients with cancer is presented; 1) determine life expectancy and treatment goals, 2) review medications, 3) evaluate medication appropriateness, 4) identify medications to cease, 5) create a deprescribing plan, and 6) monitor and review. Although further research is required, there is an increasing body of research demonstrating that deprescribing inappropriate or unnecessary medications is feasible, can be done safely, and can improve patient quality of life.",

Common determinants of poor CIN/FN outcomes included concomitant antibiotic prophylaxis, impaired performance status, and any grade CIN in a previous cycle, whereas common determinants of good outcomes included over-prophylaxis and prophylaxis initiation within 24\u201372\u00a0h. In the elderly, female gender, liver/renal/cardiovascular disease, secondary prophylaxis, and under-prophylaxis were associated with poorer outcomes. In the non-elderly, CIN4 at baseline or in a prior cycle was associated with poorer CIN/FN outcomes, and higher biosimilar filgrastim dose and, perhaps counter-intuitively, under-prophylaxis with better outcomes.Adequate GCSF support is essential for all patients, but especially for elderly patients with serious chronic disease, certainly, if concomitant antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated and if a CIN4 episode occurred in a prior cycle. The potential impact of impaired performance status, especially ECOG\u00a0\u2265\u00a02 at chemotherapy start or a worsening to such during chemotherapy; under-prophylaxis, including inadequate secondary prophylaxis, should be considered in elderly patients. Timely GCSF initiation and over-prophylaxis is associated with lower rates of adverse CIN/FN events in elderly and non-elderly patients, and should be further evaluated in prospective randomized trials.",

RF was estimated with 4 formulas (modified Jelliffe [Jelliffe], Cockcroft\u2013Gault [CG], Wright, and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD]), using actual, ideal and adjusted body weights for 492 patients. The association between baseline RF and grade 3\u20135 CRT was evaluated by unconditional logistic regression.As a continuous variable, decreased creatinine clearance (CrCl) calculated by CG with actual body weight was associated with increased odds of CRT (OR 1.12, P\u00a0<\u00a00.01; 95% CI 1.04\u20131.20) indicating that on average for every 10\u00a0mL/min decrease in CrCl the odds of CRT increased by 12%. Very low RF (in the lowest 10%) with all formulas (CG, Jelliffe, Wright and MDRD) was associated with increased odds for CRT. This association is independent of the type of chemotherapy received (those requiring dose adjustment for renal function vs not). Neither primary dose reduction nor chemotherapy duration was associated with CRT. Serum creatinine alone was not associated with increased odds of CRT (OR 0.67, P\u00a0=\u00a00.15).Decreased RF is associated with increased odds of CRT and should be considered when assessing risk of CRT in older adults with cancer.

However, there is limited data about elderly patients with cervical cancer and gross underrepresentation of elderly patients in clinical trials. Hence, the optimal therapy of such patients is not well formulated.We conducted this systematic review of evidence to assess patterns of care in elderly patients with cervical cancer.A total of 17,338 publications are reported in PubMed until July, 2016 pertaining to cervical cancer. Out of these, only 24 publications (full length papers or meeting proceedings) reported about clinical outcomes of elderly patients with cervical carcinoma. These publications report data from as early as 1949 to the present. In these publications, out of 14,479 patients aged \u2265\u00a060\u00a0years of age, 11,279 (77.89%) received external beam radiation. Concurrent chemotherapy has been used in 11 publications. Brachytherapy usage has been reported in 19 publications. In a few studies, brachytherapy was not used because of fear of toxicity. Overall, low dose rate (LDR) was the most common modality, followed by high dose rate (HDR). The authors have showed technical reasons (48.7%), comorbidities (69.4%) and patient refusal (38.3%) as causes for not delivering brachytherapy. Five-year overall survival (OS) has been found to be inferior to the non-elderly cohort and ranges from 27%\u201369% for elderly patients compared to 58%\u201375% in the non-elderly population. An 11% 5\u00a0year OS has been reported for patients treated with suboptimal radiation dose compared to 74% in those treated with chemo radiotherapy followed by brachytherapy.Gross underrepresentation of patients above 65\u00a0years in clinical trials has resulted in treatment dilemmas in the elderly.

MM was defined as the occurrence or co-occurrence of chronic conditions, functional limitations, and/or geriatric syndromes. Aggressive care was based on claims-derived measures of receipt of cancer-directed treatment in the last two weeks of life; admission to the hospital and/or emergency department (ED) within the last month; and in-hospital death. We also identified patients enrolled in hospice. In multivariable logistic regression models, we analyzed the associations of interest, adjusting for potential confounders.While 61.2% of the patients enrolled in hospice, 24.6% underwent cancer-directed treatment; 55.1% were admitted to the hospital and/or ED; and 21.7% died in the hospital. We observed a U-shaped distribution between income and in-hospital death. Chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes were associated with some outcomes, but not with others.To improve quality end-of-life care and curtail costs incurred by dying patients, relevant interventions need to account for social determinants of health and MM in a nuanced fashion.",

Subjects were interviewed directly using a procedure that included a clinical test and a questionnaire composed of the KPS, PPT and abridged GCA. Overall survival (OS) was the primary endpoint. The log rank test was used to compare survival curves, and Cox's regression model (forward procedure) was used for multivariate survival analysis.One hundred patients were included in this study. Abridged GA was the only tool found to predict mortality [median OS for unfit patients (at least two impairments) 467\u00a0days vs 1030\u00a0days for fit patients; p\u00a0=\u00a00.04]. Patients defined as fit by mean PPT score (>\u00a020) had worse median OS (560 vs 721\u00a0days); however, this difference was not significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.488 on log rank). Although median OS did not differ significantly between patients with low (\u2264\u00a080) and high (>\u00a080) KPS scores (467 and 795\u00a0days, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a00.09), survival curves diverged after nearly 120\u00a0days of follow-up. Visual and hearing impairments were the only components of abridged GA of prognostic value.Neither KPS nor PPT were shown to predict mortality in elderly patients with cancer whereas abridged GA was predictive. This study suggests a possible role for visual and hearing assessment as screening for patients requiring CGA.",

These associations also decreased in adjusted models.Women with higher GOB scores had a lower hazard of all-cause mortality in unadjusted analysis. This effect diminished after adjusting for confounding clinical and HRQoL variables. GOB is a measure of motivation that may not be independently associated with cancer mortality, but reflects other HRQoL variables making it a potential outcome to monitor in older patients with cancer.",

Older adults may be more vulnerable to toxicity of therapy, resulting in decreased dose intensity and contributing to poorer outcomes.

     "abstract": "Traditionally used as a descriptive term, frailty is now a recognized medical syndrome identifying individuals with decreased physiologic reserve. Frailty is characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function. Several valid frailty screening tools exist in the literature, and these measures have been used to relate frailty to outcomes important to the older patient with cancer. Frail adults are at increased risk of adverse surgical outcomes and early findings suggest that frailty predicts poor chemotherapy tolerance. While much research is needed to explore the biologic relationships between frailty and cancer, there is an urgent need to implement frailty screening and management into the care of the older patient with cancer in order to improve outcomes in this vulnerable subset. The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction of frailty to oncologists including a review of the definition, frailty screening tools, its clinical relevance to older patients with cancer, and a brief guide to frailty management.",

This phase II study evaluates safety and efficacy of a combination of these two agents in patients >\u00a070\u00a0years with advanced NSCLC.Patients with treatment na\u00efve metastatic NSCLC received two cycles comprising 6 weekly doses of vinorelbine and paclitaxel, with restaging scans at week 8. Patients with radiographic progression came off study. The estimated sample size was 29. Toxicity analyses were conducted after 10 patients and again after 19 patients were enrolled. Outcomes were safety and efficacy, progression free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and quality of life (QOL).The study closed at second interim analysis as 6/19 patients had \u2265\u00a0grade 4 non-hematologic toxicity (respiratory failure, sepsis, ischemic encephalopathy, pneumonia, hypoxemia, cardiopulmonary arrest, neutropenic fever, death). Of the 16 evaluable patients, 7 completed the study. Disease control rate (partial response\u00a0+\u00a0stable disease) was 47% (n\u00a0=\u00a09); 37% (n\u00a0=\u00a07) progressed.

QOL did not change compared to baseline, at week 9, but increased at week 17.Although the combination met its response end points, increased toxicity makes this combination unsuitable for older patients.

The present population-based study provides insight into the impact of age on palliative systemic therapy in patients with metachronous metastases from CRC, in order to optimize the decision-making process.Data on the development and treatment of metachronous metastases were collected for patients with primary resected CRC diagnosed between 2003 and 2008 in the Eindhoven area of the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Patients undergoing surgery for metastases were excluded, resulting in a study population treated with palliative intent, with or without systemic therapy (n\u00a0=\u00a0746).385 patients received palliative systemic therapy (52%). Patients aged \u2265\u00a075\u00a0years were less likely to receive systemic therapy (31% \u2265\u00a075\u00a0years vs 73% <\u00a060\u00a0years) and more likely to receive single-agent chemotherapy than combination-chemotherapy.

CIN was subdivided into two groups: CIN25% (SCr increase >\u00a025% but \u2264\u00a00.5\u00a0mg/dl), and CIN0.5 (SCr increase >\u00a00.5\u00a0mg/dl).

CIN0.5 was significantly correlated with prolonged hospitalizations and increased in-hospital mortality, but not CIN25%. Despite SCr\u00a0<\u00a01.5\u00a0mg/dl, preexisting renal insufficiency (RI) was observed in 47 (13.5%) patients based on CKD-EPI equation, 50 (14.4%) patients based on MDRD equation, and 144 (41.4%) patients based on CG formula. In preexisting RI, the prevalence of CIN0.5 had an odds ratio of 15.02 (5.24 to 43.07) based on CKD-EPI equation, 13.73 (4.81 to 39.20) based on MDRD equation, and 5.03 (1.60 to 15.75) based on CG formula.In elderly patients with cancer who visit the emergency department, renal assessment before CECT using CKD-EPI equation was superior to SCr alone, MDRD equation, or CG formula in predicting the occurrence of CIN related CECT.",

Although some studies suggested that a negative view of cancer may increase the level of depression, such an association has never been studied in the elderly population. Similarly, even though it is established that a negative self-perception of aging has deleterious consequences on mental and physical health in normal aging, the influence in pathological contexts, such as oncology, has not been studied. The main aim of this study is thus to analyze the effect of these two stigmas on the health of elderly oncology patients.101 patients suffering from a cancer (breast, gynecological, lung or hematological) were seen as soon as possible after their diagnosis. Their self-perception of age, cancer view and health (physical and mental) was assessed.Multiple regressions showed that patients with a more negative self-perception of aging and/or more negative cancer view reported poorer global health. We also observed that negative self-perception of aging was associated with worse physical and mental health, whereas negative cancer views were only linked to worse mental health. No interaction was observed between these two stigmas, suggesting that their action is independent.Older patients with cancer face double stigmatization, due to negative self-perception of aging and cancer, and these stigmas have impacts on global and mental health. Self-perception of aging is also linked to physical health. Longitudinal studies will be necessary to analyze the direction of the association between this double stigmatization and health.",

Preoperative sarcopenia was diagnosed by the presence of low muscle mass and low physical functions according to Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia criteria. Low physical function was defined by loss of grip strength and/or slow walking speed. Postoperative pulmonary, cardiac, infectious, and surgical complications were extracted. Perioperative functional changes were calculated (value at postoperative day 30\u00a0\u2212\u00a0value before surgery). For statistical analyses, both uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed.Twenty-nine patients (27.9%) were diagnosed with sarcopenia. The incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications was significantly higher in the sarcopenia group (37.9%) than in the non-sarcopenia group (17.3%; P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). There was no relationship between sarcopenia and other complications or perioperative functional changes. Multivariate analysis identified sarcopenia (odds ratio (OR), 3.13; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12\u20138.93) and high Brinkman index (OR, 3.46; 95% CI, 1.20\u201311.77) as independent risk factors for the development of pulmonary complications.The assessment of sarcopenia may be useful to predict the postoperative pulmonary complications following esophagectomy. On the other hand, sarcopenia does not predict cardiac, infectious, and surgical complications or perioperative function.",

Little is known about the prevalence of vulnerability and predictors of mortality in this population compared to men without a PCa diagnosis. We examined the predictive utility of the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) for mortality in older men with a PCa diagnosis as compared to controls.Men aged \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years from an urban geriatrics clinic completed the VES-13 between 2003 and 2008. Each patient with a PCa diagnosis was matched by age to five controls, resulting in 59 patients with a PCa diagnosis and 318 controls. Cox proportional hazard models were used to determine the association of a PCa diagnosis and vulnerability on the VES-13 with mortality.The mean age for men with a PCa diagnosis and controls was 77.9\u00a0years and 76.1\u00a0years, respectively. Of those with a PCa diagnosis, 74.6% had no active disease or a rising PSA only. Regardless of PCa diagnosis, vulnerable individuals on the VES-13 were more likely to die during the study period (VES-13\u00a0\u2265\u00a03: HR\u00a0=\u00a04.46, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; VES13\u00a0\u2265\u00a06: HR\u00a0=\u00a03.77, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Incidence peaks in the 7th and 8th decades of life and as our global population ages, rates are increasing. GBM is an almost universally fatal disease with life expectancy in the range of 3\u20135\u00a0months amongst the elderly.The assessment of elderly GBM patients prior to treatment decisions is poorly researched and unstandardised. In order to begin tackling this issue we performed a cross-sectional survey across all UK based consultant neuro-oncologists to review their current practice in assessing elderly GBM patients.There were 56 respondents from a total of 93 recipients (60% response rate). All respondents confirmed that at least some patients aged 70 or over were referred to their clinics from the local multidisciplinary team meeting (MDT). Only 18% of consultants routinely performed a cognitive or frailty screening test at initial consultation. Of those who performed a screening test, the majority reported that the results of the test changed their treatment decision in approximately 50% of cases. Participants ranked performance status as the most important factor in determining treatment decisions.Considering the heterogeneity of this patient population, we argue that performance status is a crude measure of vulnerability within this cohort. Elderly GBM patients represent a unique clinical scenario because of the complexity of distinguishing neuro-oncology related symptoms from general frailty. There is a need for specific geriatric assessment models tailored to the elderly neuro-oncology population in order to facilitate treatment decisions.",

Many older persons have less physiological reserves and are thus more susceptible to adverse postoperative outcomes. Therefore, it seems important to distinguish the fit patients from the more vulnerable or frail. The aim of this review is to examine the evidence regarding the impact of frailty on postoperative outcomes in older patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer. A systematic literature search of Medline Ovid was performed focusing on studies that examined the impact of frailty on postoperative outcomes after colorectal surgery in older people aged \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years. The methodological quality of the studies was evaluated using the MINORS quality assessment. Five articles, involving four studies and 486 participants in total, were included. Regardless of varying definitions of frailty and postoperative outcomes, the frail patients had less favourable outcomes in all of the studies. Compared to the non-frail group, the frail group had a higher risk of developing moderate to severe postoperative complications, had longer hospital stays, higher readmission rates, and decreased long-term survival rates. The results of this systematic review suggest the importance of assessing frailty in older persons scheduled for colorectal surgery because frailty is associated with a greater risk of postoperative adverse outcomes. We conclude that, although there is no consensus on the definition of frailty, assessing frailty in colorectal oncology seems important to determine operative risks and benefits and to guide perioperative management.",

Polypharmacy has somewhat variably been incorporated into geriatric assessment studies in geriatric oncology, and polypharmacy has not been consistently evaluated as a predictor of negative outcomes in patients with cancer. Once screened, interventions for polypharmacy are even more uncertain. There is a great need to create standardized interventions to improve polypharmacy in geriatrics, and particularly in geriatric oncology. The process of deprescribing is aimed at reducing medications for which real or potential harm outweighs benefit, and there are numerous methods to determine which medications are candidates for deprescribing. However, deprescribing approaches have not been evaluated in older patients with cancer. Ultimately, methods to identify polypharmacy will need to be clearly defined and validated, and interventions to improve medication use will need to be based on clearly defined and standardized methods.",

As the population ages, the number of older women with ovarian cancer is increasing. Compared to younger women, older women with ovarian cancer receive less surgery and chemotherapy, develop worse toxicity, and have poorer outcomes. They are also significantly under-represented in clinical trials and thus application of standard treatment regimens can be challenging. Performance status alone has been shown to be an inadequate tool to predict toxicity of older patients from chemotherapy.

     "abstract": "Lung cancer is a disease that afflicts the elderly. It is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Treatment of lung cancer which was predominantly combination chemotherapy was initially thought to be too toxic for older patients with cancer due to their frail state. However a number of recent studies have shown that this is not necessarily true and many elderly can actually tolerate combination chemotherapy and derive just as much benefit from it as younger patients with lung cancer do. More recently it has been found that a significant proportion of lung cancer patients have tumors that harbor mutations that are targetable by molecularly targeted therapy (MTT). These targeted therapies have a much better tolerated side effect profile, hence have been used in elderly patient with lung cancer with great success. A new generation of drugs called immune checkpoint inhibitors have now come into the fray with exciting results in the second line treatment of lung cancer with a low side effect profile. A key element in deciding whether an elderly patient with lung cancer can tolerate treatment involves a detailed assessment using the comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). A number of CGA and clinical factors have also been found to be able to predict chemotherapy associated toxicity.

The purpose of this paper is to review major new trends in surgical geriatric oncology research within the last decade. Reviewing PubMed listings of the last 10\u00a0years reveals several identifiable areas of particular concentration. Although we use specific studies primarily from lung cancer treatment, the generalizations can be seen across the spectrum of geriatric cancers. These trends include screening for disease that can be successfully treated, integration of operative and non-operative therapies that are changing the indications for surgery, the use of prehabilitation to allow more borderline frail patients to be treated surgically, the use of rehabilitation to facilitate rapid and complete recovery, prevention and treatment of common morbidities, with a special recent focus on delirium and cognitive impairment. New areas of surgical research include research on team building in the OR and ICU. Recent surgical research is becoming quantitative and multi-institutionally based. Overall surgical mortality has dropped over the past 25\u00a0years in both academic and community hospitals. Prevention of morbidity and loss of functional status is a major focus of research. Funding for new Quality Assurance Projects for elderly patients has been awarded to the American College of Surgeons, and should provide multi-institutional quality outcome data within 5\u00a0years.",

Emerging new treatment approaches in older patients offer novel opportunities, but also novel challenges which are discussed in this review.",

However, the number of clinicians with a particular interest in geriatric oncology and who complete training in both specialties is low. There are insufficient geriatric oncologists and geriatricians to address the unique needs of this population of patients. The majority of older adults with cancer are, and will continue to be, treated by oncologists. Currently clinicians caring for patients with cancer receive little to no formal training in caring for older adults, resulting in gaps in knowledge as well as a lack of confidence when treating older adults with cancers. Key strategies to accelerate the uptake and impact of educational initiatives to address this gap include the use of effective educational strategies, broad dissemination of educational material that is freely available, and the integration of geriatric oncology topics into teaching, curriculum, assessments and exams.",

Based on a review of high-impact journals in geriatrics for the prior two years and reviews of journals in which geriatrics updates are published, updates for hypertension, dementia, vaccination, and frailty are presented here. Recent studies have supported lower, more aggressive blood pressure targets in the management of hypertension, even in older patients. However, controversy remains as to the cognitive and functional effects of aggressive blood pressure targets. Advances in dementia management have been slow, but recent reviews have supported the use of specific screening tools and advocated more widespread screening for mild cognitive impairment and dementia by primary care practitioners. Pharmacologic trials have largely been negative, but a recent multi-component lifestyle intervention showed promise. Significant changes in immunization recommendations have occurred due to two recent large randomized studies of pneumococcal vaccine and a new subunit zoster vaccine. Finally, interventions for frailty syndrome in the geriatric population have been somewhat variable, with some promise in addressing exercise, nutrition, as well as pharmacologic treatment of frailty.",

     "abstract": "Cancer is a disease occurring disproportionately in older adults. However, the evidence base regarding how best to care for these patients remains limited due to their underrepresentation in cancer clinical trials. Pragmatic clinical trials represent a promising approach for enhancing the evidence base in geriatric oncology by allowing investigators to enroll older, frailer patients onto cancer clinical trials. These trials are more accessible, less resource intensive, and place minimal additional burden on participating patients. Additionally, these trials can be designed to measure endpoints directly relevant to older adults, such as quality of life, functional independence and treatment tolerability which are often not addressed in standard clinical trials. Therefore, pragmatic clinical trials allow researchers to include patients for whom the treatment will ultimately be applied and to utilize meaningful endpoints. Examples of pragmatic studies include both large, simple trials and cluster randomized trials. These study designs allow investigators to conduct clinical trials within the context of everyday practice. Further, researchers can devise these studies to place minimal burden on the patient, the treating clinicians and the participating institutions. In order to be successful, pragmatic trials must efficiently utilize the electronic medical record for data capture while also maximizing patient recruitment, enrollment and retention. Additionally, by strategically utilizing pragmatic clinical trials to test therapies and interventions that have previously shown efficacy in younger, fitter patients, these trials represent a potential mechanism to improve the evidence base in geriatric oncology and enhance care for older adults with cancer.",

Given the rising incidence of cancer with age, CRCI is of particular concern for older patients with cancer who receive treatment. Therefore, research related to CRCI in older patients with cancers is a high priority. In this manuscript, we discuss current gaps in research highlighting the lack of clinical studies of CRCI in older adults, the complex mechanisms of CRCI, and the challenges in measuring cognitive impairment in older patients with cancer.

In May of 2015, the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Aging co-sponsored a conference focused on future directions in geriatric oncology research. Nutritional research among older adults with cancer was highlighted as a major area of concern as most nutritional cancer research has been conducted among younger adults, with limited evidence to guide the care of nutritional issues among older adults with cancer. Cancer diagnoses among older adults are increasing, and the care of the older adult with cancer is complicated due to multimorbidity, heterogeneous functional status, polypharmacy, deficits in cognitive and mental health, and several other non-cancer factors. Due to this complexity, nutritional needs are dynamic, multifaceted, and dependent on the clinical scenario. This manuscript outlines the proceedings of this conference including knowledge gaps and recommendations for future nutritional research among older adults with cancer. Three common clinical scenarios encountered by oncologists include (1) weight loss during anti-cancer therapy, (2) malnutrition during advanced disease, and (3) obesity during survivorship. In this manuscript, we provide a brief overview of relevant cancer literature within these three areas, knowledge gaps that exist, and recommendations for future research.",

Exercise interventions have been shown to be effective in treating both the physical and psychological declines associated with cancer and its treatment, with a potential to improve cancer-related outcomes. Despite the current evidence, exercise is clearly underutilized due to several barriers and knowledge gaps in existing trials that include appropriate population identification, design, and outcome measures selection. The benefits of regular exercise in both the primary and secondary prevention of chronic conditions are well established in the non-cancer population.

The number of older cancer survivors will continue to increase as the population ages and as patients' live longer after a cancer diagnosis. As part of cancer center accreditation, the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer\u00ae (CoC) has placed great importance on survivorship care planning. While the CoC has set standards for general survivorship care, there is sparse evidence on how to best care for older adult cancer survivors. Concern exists among the medical community that survivorship care plans could increase paperwork without improving outcomes. Given the diverse and unique needs of older adult cancer survivors, the inter-professional team provides a structure and process for survivorship care built around the particular needs of older adults. The Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG), in partnership with the NIA/NCI, held a U13 conference in May 2015 in part to discuss survivorship care for older adults with cancer. This report discusses four themes that emerged from one section of the conference: (1) survivorship care is a process that continually evolves to meet the needs of older adults; (2) older adult cancer survivors have unique needs and care plans should be tailored to meet these needs; (3) the inter-professional team is ideally suited to structure survivorship care of older adults; (4) patient advocacy must be encouraged throughout the cancer care continuum. As evidence based survivorship practices develop, the unique needs of older adults need to be given substantial attention.",

The primary outcome measure was the age-dependent rate of discontinuation of endocrine treatment within 5\u00a0years after initiation. Discontinuation of therapy was defined as a period of at least 90\u00a0days without treatment. A multivariate Cox regression model was created to determine the influence of age on the risk of discontinuation.

Frailty, describing a state of increased vulnerability, is common in older patients, but frailty and high age are not necessarily contraindications to surgical treatment. However, limited data describing long-term outcomes after surgery in this patient group exist. In this clinical follow-up study, we aimed to examine long-term health-related quality of life in older surgical patients with colorectal cancer.Patients were recruited from a prospective multicenter study investigating frailty as a predictor of postoperative complications after surgery for colorectal cancer. A preoperative geriatric assessment was performed, and patients were classified as frail or non-frail. Patients responded to version 3.0 of The European Organisation of Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-C30 before surgery, 3\u00a0months postoperatively and at a long-term follow-up 16\u201328\u00a0months (median 22\u00a0months) after surgery. One-way repeated-measures analyses of variance were performed to examine changes in scores over time.180 patients with a mean age of 80\u00a0years were included at baseline, 138 at 3\u00a0months postoperatively, and 84 patients (69% of survivors) at long-term follow-up. A significant improvement in quality of life-scores was present 3\u00a0months after surgery, also in the subgroup of frail patients. At long-term follow-up, scores decreased, but to values above baseline.Health-related quality of life may be improved in older patients after surgery for colorectal cancer, even in patients who are classified as frail preoperatively.",

Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the association of falls with HRQOL measured by the physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) scores on the Veteran RAND 12-item health survey after controlling for demographic, health- and cancer-related factors. A longitudinal analysis using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models was also conducted comparing changes in HRQOL of older cancer survivors who fell with HRQOL of older patients with cancer who did not fall.In the cross-sectional analysis, 4524 (25%) cancer survivors who fell reported a significantly lower PCS (\u2212\u00a02.18; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.16) and MCS (2.00; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.17) scores compared to those who did not (N\u00a0=\u00a013,434). In the longitudinal analysis, after adjusting for baseline HRQOL scores and covariates, patients who fell reported a decline in mean HRQOL scores of both PCS (\u2212\u00a01.54; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.26) and MCS (\u2212\u00a01.71; SE\u00a0=\u00a00.27). Presence of depression, functional impairment and comorbidities was significantly associated with lower HRQOL scores.Falls are associated with lower HRQOL scores and are associated with a significant prospective decline in HRQOL in older cancer survivors. Further research is necessary to determine if assessment and intervention programs can help improve HRQOL by reducing the likelihood of falls.",

We investigated if similar information could be obtained by a simpler assessment based on the original CIRS.Data from a randomized chemotherapy trial (RCT) on advanced NSCLC (non-small cell lung cancer) were analyzed. Baseline comorbidity was assessed by 1) trained oncologists using hospital records and the CIRS-G manual (CIRS-G), 2) by patients' oncologists/pulmonologists (local investigators\u00a0=\u00a0LI-score) using a brief set of instructions. By both methods, the severity of comorbidity in 14 organ systems was graded 0 (no problem) to 4 (extremely severe). The agreement between methods was assessed using Bland\u2013Altman analysis and weighted kappa statistics. The impact of comorbidity on survival was analyzed by Cox regression.Complete data were available for 375/446 (84%) patients enrolled in the RCT. Median age was 65\u00a0years (25\u201385).

Alternative tests were created and performance assessed on a development population (ONCODAGE cohort). The highest performing test was compared to the G8, and validated through both an internal and an external population validation (Aquitaine Geriatric Oncology cohort).The study population consisted of 1435 patients (ONCODAGE cohort) and 364 patients (Aquitaine Geriatric Oncology cohort). Twenty-three experts validated two items with a strong consensus (>\u00a075%): modification of the threshold for the G8 polypharmacy item to six drugs per day and replacement of the G8 item on neuropsychological problems by four Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) items predictive of incident dementia, creating three modified G8 tests (addition of either item, or both).

Glioblastoma is almost always incurable and most older patients survive less than 6\u00a0months. Supportive care with steroids and anti-epileptic drugs is critical to improving and maintain quality of life. Young age, good performance status and methylation of the methyl guanyl methyl transferase promoter are important positive prognostic factors. Several recent clinical trials suggest that there is a subset of the elderly with prolonged survival that is comparable to younger patients. Treatment of glioblastoma in older patients includes maximal safe resection followed by either radiation, chemotherapy or combined modality therapy. Recent advances suggest that some patients can avoid radiation entirely and be treated with chemotherapy alone. Decisions about therapy are individual and based on a patient's performance status, family support and molecular features. Future work needs to better determine the role for comprehensive geriatric assessments in this patient population to better identify patients who may most benefit from aggressive therapies.",

We assessed trends in assay use (using multivariable regression), adjuvant chemotherapy use, and associated expenditures, for all patients and for two age strata: age 66\u201374\u00a0years and 75\u201394\u00a0years. Geographic variations in assay adoption and regional-level correlation between assay and chemotherapy use were measured.We identified 132,222 women who underwent breast surgery from 2008\u20132011. Assay use increased from 9.0% to 17.2% from 2008\u20132011 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), but chemotherapy use remained stable at 12.5% (p\u00a0=\u00a0.49). In younger patients, assay use increased from 14.3% to 23.7% (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), while chemotherapy use decreased from 18.2% to 16.2% (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). In older patients, assay use increased from 4.1% to 9.9% (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001), while chemotherapy use remained stable at 6.8% (p\u00a0=\u00a0.67). Mean per-beneficiary expenditures for testing and chemotherapy increased from $2030 to $2430 (p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Regions with increased assay adoption were not more likely to reduce chemotherapy.Despite increased RS testing for both younger and older Medicare patients, there has only been a modest decrease in chemotherapy use for younger patients and no change for older patients, resulting in an overall increase in costs associated with gene expression profiling.",

Pretreatment comorbidities were identified by ICD-9 codes and chart review. Comorbidity burden (modified Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]) and specific conditions were analyzed individually. Outcomes were overall survival (OS), remission, and 30-day mortality. Covariates included age, gender, cytogenetic characteristics, hemoglobin, white cell count, lactate dehydrogenase, body mass index, and insurance type. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate OS; logistic regression was used for remission and 30-day mortality.In this series, 144 patients were \u2265\u00a060\u00a0years old (median age 70\u00a0years, median survival 8.7\u00a0months) and 133 were <\u00a060\u00a0years (median age 47\u00a0years, median survival 23.1\u00a0months). Older patients had a higher comorbidity burden (CCI\u00a0\u2265\u00a01 58% versus 26%, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Prevalent comorbid conditions differed by age (diabetes 19.2% versus 7.5%; cardiovascular disease 12.5% versus 4.5%, for older versus younger patients, respectively). The CCI was not independently associated with OS or 30-day mortality in either age group. Among older patients, diabetes was associated with higher 30-day mortality (33.3% vs. 12.0% in diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Controlling for age, cytogenetic characteristics and other comorbidities, the presence of diabetes increased the odds of 30-day mortality by 4.9 (CI 1.6\u201315.2) times.Diabetes is adversely associated with 30-day survival in older AML patients receiving intensive therapy.",

     "abstract": "Although older patients represent the most rapidly growing segment of the oncology population, clinical care is guided by very little data on patient-reported outcomes, particularly satisfaction with healthcare. Using a large cancer center registry, we sought to describe factors associated with satisfaction with care for older and younger oncology patients.Data were collected through the University of North Carolina Health Registry Cancer Survivorship Cohort. Satisfaction was measured with the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form. Quality of life (QOL) measures included were the Promis Global short form and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy General (FACT-G).A total of 2385 patients were included. 460 (20%) were aged 70 and above (older group). Older patients reported significantly higher levels of satisfaction in domains of time spent with doctor (scores 3.84 versus 3.73 p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and financial aspects (scores 4.03 versus 3.44 p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) compared to younger patients. In multivariable analysis, higher QOL scores and higher self-reported ECOG performance status were associated with higher satisfaction scores. African American race was associated with lower satisfaction scores in all age groups. QOL was more closely correlated with satisfaction in older patients compared to younger patients.Older patients with cancer report higher levels of satisfaction with care, in part due to lesser financial burden of care. Better QOL is associated with satisfaction with care in older patients. Use of patient-reported outcomes such as patient satisfaction may help improve patient-centered geriatric oncology care.",

We analyzed the utilization of these services among older adults (65\u00a0years and older) and compared them to those in younger adults (40\u201364\u00a0years) with advanced cancer.A retrospective chart review of 567 veterans who died with advanced cancer between 2002 and 2009 and utilized PCS and ACS prior to death was conducted after IRB approval. To assess PCS utilization, we studied the mean duration between day of hospice referral and time of death (DOR) and the mean length of stay with hospice (LoS). The frequency of emergency room visits (ERVLM), hospital admissions (HALM), and ICU admissions (ICULM) in the last month of life was used as a measure for ACS. The differences among older and younger patients were compared using two sample t-tests.Older adults had earlier referral to PCS [mean DOR: 47.3 versus 34.5\u00a0days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.015], longer stay with hospice [mean LoS: 32.5 versus 20.2\u00a0days, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007], fewer hospital [HALM: 0.7 versus 0.9, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043], and ICU admissions [ICULM: 0.1 versus 0.2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.030] per patient.

However, there continues to be significant utilization of ACS in all patients with advanced cancer. Better understanding of the goals of care in older adults with cancer and education of oncology providers regarding the need to utilize and integrate palliative care services earlier in the course of disease is imperative.",

Univariate associations were evaluated using Spearman's correlation and Wilcoxon sign ranked tests. Logistic regressions were used to identify associations of clinical factors and SarcoPRO scores or SPPB scores with falls and IADL limitations.In total, 174 older patients with cancer were evaluated. A moderate correlation was found between the SarcoPRO and the SPPB (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.62). After adjusting for multiple clinical factors, neither the SarcoPRO nor the SPPB were associated with falls. In contrast, both higher SarcoPRO (i.e., worse) and lower SPPB (i.e., worse) scores were associated with limitations in IADLs (odds ratio for one unit change in predictor: SarcoPRO: 1.06, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001; SPPB: 0.71, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003, respectively). Models using the SarcoPRO and SPPB explained similar amounts of variability in association with IADL limitations (AUC: 0.88 vs. 0.87, respectively).The SarcoPRO was moderately associated with the SPPB, an objective measure of physical performance, and was associated with limitations in IADLs. Thus, older patients with cancer who present with IADL limitations should be screened for sarcopenia. The SarcoPRO shows promise as a measure for screening as well as outcome assessment for research on sarcopenia.",

Sarcopenia was defined using sex- and body mass index (BMI)\u2013specific threshold values of SMI.Eighty-seven patients were included, with a median age of 77\u00a0years (70\u201396). Twenty-five men (60% of 42) and 25 women (56% of 45) had sarcopenia. Sarcopenic patients had significantly lower BMI (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) compared to non-sarcopenic patients. There was a positive correlation between BMI and SMI for both men (r\u00a0=\u00a00.44) and women (r\u00a0=\u00a00.16).Sarcopenia is highly prevalent among older patients with early stage colorectal cancer. BMI alone is a poor indicator of lean body mass and improved methods of screening for sarcopenia are necessary.

Our objective was to evaluate utilization of metastasectomy in colon cancer and its survival outcomes in groups defined by different age at diagnosis, tumor grade or varying extent of nodal spread.We extracted data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database on adult patients with stage IV colon cancer diagnosed between 2003 and 2011. We analyzed the association of overall survival (OS) with metastasectomy using multivariable Cox models.Among 41,137 patients with stage IV cancer, 26,607 (65%) underwent primary surgery and 5028 (12.2%) underwent metastasectomy. Older patients were less likely to have \u2265\u00a012 lymph nodes examined in the surgical specimen, but also less likely to have nodal metastases when adequately staged (from 86% for age <\u00a050\u00a0years to 79% for age \u2265\u00a085\u00a0years). Metastasectomy was less common in older patients (from 18% for age <\u00a050\u00a0years to 7% for age \u2265\u00a085\u00a0years). OS after resection was inversely associated with age and nodal involvement. The association of metastasectomy with survival was favorable in all age groups (hazard ratio, HR, 0.68\u20130.72, P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), but it was not significant for those \u2265\u00a085\u00a0years old (HR, 0.92, P\u00a0=\u00a00.23). It was also favorable regardless of the extent of nodal spread or tumor grade.Resection of metastatic site is favorably associated with survival in patients up to 85\u00a0years of age.

The mGPS correlated also with clinical staging (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) and performance status (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039).Inflammatory parameters correlate significantly with frailty, more advanced clinical stage and poor functional status.",

     "abstract": "Several frailty screening tests in older cancer patients were developed but their statistical performance is low. We aimed to assess whether measurement of usual gait speed (GS) alone could be used as a frailty screening test in older cancer patients. This systematic review was conducted on \u201cpub med\u201d between 1984 and 2014 and included reviews and original studies. Eligibility criteria were: GS over a short distance, alone or included in composite walking tests (Timed Get Up and Go test: TGUG, Short Physical Performance Battery: SPPB) in older people (aged 65 and over) living in a community setting and predictive value of GS on medical complications associated with frailty. 46 articles were finally selected. GS alone is consensual and recommended for screening sarcopenia in elderly. A slow GS is predictive of early death, disability, falls and hospitalization/institutionalization in older people living in a community setting. GS alone is comparable to composite walking tests that do not provide additional information on the medical complications associated with frailty. Despite few studies in geriatric oncology, GS seems to predict overall survival and disability. We suggest GS over 4\u00a0m (at a threshold of 1\u00a0m/s) as a new frailty screening test in older cancer patients (65 and over) to guide the implementation of a comprehensive geriatric assessment during the initial management phase or during follow-up. Prospective cohort studies are needed to validate this algorithm and compare it with other screening tool.",

This is an observational study conducted in 363 patients aged\u00a0\u2265\u00a065\u00a0years, newly diagnosed with different hematological malignancies (myelodysplasic syndrome/acute myeloblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia), and treatment-na\u00efve. The scale psychometric validation process included the analyses of feasibility, floor and ceiling effect, validity and reliability criteria.Mean time taken to complete the GAH scale was 11.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.7\u00a0min that improved through a learning-curve effect. Almost 90% of patients completed all items, and no floor or ceiling effects were identified. Criterion validity was supported by reasonable correlations between the GAH scale dimensions and three contrast variables (global health visual analogue scale, ECOG and Karnofsky), except for comorbidities. Factor analysis (supported by the scree plot) revealed nine factors that explained almost 60% of the total variance. Moderate internal consistency reliability was found (Cronbach's \u03b1: 0.610), and test\u2013retest was excellent (ICC coefficients, 0.695\u20130.928).Our study suggests that the GAH scale is a valid, internally reliable and a consistent tool to assess health status in older patients with different hematological malignancies. Future large studies should confirm whether the GAH scale may be a tool to improve clinical decision-making in older patients with hematological malignancies.",

G8 and CGA were proposed to 107 consecutive patients (65\u201389\u00a0years) with hematological malignancies assessed by their physicians as clinically fit, meaning not exhibiting geriatric syndromes and/or irreversible comorbidities significantly impairing their daily function, and thus able to receive chemotherapy.Out of 107 patients, 90 patients were evaluable and completed both scales; 72% and 80% were defined as \u201cvulnerable\u201d when evaluated with G8 (\u2264\u00a014.5) or CGA (\u2265\u00a02 impairments) respectively.

However, a clear consensus on the optimal set of GA instruments is lacking, particularly for surgical patients.

The summary deficit score based on Pre-operative Assessment of Cancer in the Elderly (PACE) or the GA consisting of functional, mobility, cognitive, depression, nutritional, co-morbidity, polypharmacy, and social support assessment domains can predict 30-day postoperative morbidity.

The coexistence of multiple chronic conditions in one patient is best termed multimorbidity, and it affects a growing percentage of the population each year. In cancer care, as in much sub-specialty care, \u201cother diseases\u201d have been approached from a research and clinical standpoint as \u201ccomorbidities\u201d \u2013 other age-associated diseases that are of secondary importance to cancer care. This is not the same as the newer concept of \u201cmultimorbidity\u201d, a situation in which several overlapping chronic conditions are managed as equally-important to patient quality of life and outcomes. In the absence of a substantial evidence base or clinical practice guidelines that are tailored for multimorbid patients, clinicians need practical guidance for a rational approach to care for these complex patients. We adapt the American Geriatrics Society's Guiding Principles as an excellent starting point for clinical decision-making and management. These Guiding Principles include: 1) assessing patient preferences, 2) interpreting the available evidence, 3) estimating prognosis, 4) considering treatment feasibility, and 5) optimizing therapies and care plans. We apply them to older patients with cancer. As the population of older adults with cancer and multimorbidity grows, understanding the impact of multimorbidity on the care of patients with cancer and developing a management approach for these vulnerable patients will be vital for oncology care.",

We characterized the impact of AML and its treatment on quality of life (QOL) and physical function in younger (age 18\u201359) and older (age 60\u00a0+) patients with AML over 1\u00a0year from diagnosis.AML patients undergoing IC without stem-cell transplant at two tertiary care centers were enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal study. Assessments were done pre-IC and at 7 time points over the next year. QOL, fatigue, and physical performance (grip strength, 2-minute walk test (2MWT), timed chair stands) were measured in all patients whereas daily function was measured only in older patients. Data were analyzed using mixed effects regression models.237 patients were recruited (140 younger and 97 older, 56% male). One-year survival was 79% and 60% among younger and older patients, respectively. For patients in remission, global QOL and fatigue improved significantly over time (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 for both); trends were similar between older and younger patients. Grip strength did not change over time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.58) whereas both the 2MWT (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and timed chair stands (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) improved significantly. Daily function improved significantly over time (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).Survivors of AML in remission after IC achieve significant improvements in QOL, fatigue, and physical function over time with similar trajectories for older and younger patients. These data suggest that appropriately selected older patients do well following IC.",

The Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) is a short instrument that has been tested as a means of identifying patients who need a full CGA, but its ability to predict chemotherapy toxicity is still unclear. We performed a pooled analysis of four published clinical trials studying VES-13 as a means of diagnosing vulnerability, in order to evaluate its accuracy in predicting the risk of grade 3/4 toxicity in older patients undergoing chemotherapy.The study involved patients aged \u2265\u00a066\u00a0years with a diagnosis of solid or hematological cancer, all of whom were administered VES-13. The number of medications taken by each patient, their comorbidities, their Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G) score and index, the type of chemotherapy and treatment line, and their Mini Mental State Evaluation (MMSE), and Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) scores were recorded. Information was available concerning the grades 3\u20134 hematological and non-hematological toxicities experienced by each patient.The study involved 648 patients aged \u2265\u00a066\u00a0years (mean age 76.2 \u00b1 4.5, range 66\u201390) of whom 336 (51.9%) were female. VES-13 identified 287 patients (44.3%) as vulnerable. Grades 3\u20134 hematological and non-hematological toxicities were more prevalent in the vulnerable subjects (35.2% vs 20.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, and 18.5% vs 10.8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0055), who were also at higher risk of both (adjusted ORs 2.15, 95% CI 1.46\u20133.17, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); and 1.66 (95% CI 1.02\u20132.72, p\u00a0=\u00a00.043).VES-13 could be considered to be a good candidate for future prospective studies to assess older patients with cancer at risk of toxicity.",

Majority of potential DDI detected involved non-chemotherapeutic agents (369 cases, 92.7%) and monitoring of patient was the most common action taken (316 cases, 79.4%). Adverse drug events detected were mostly associated with chemotherapy (316 cases, 91.3%) and patient education was the most common action taken (236 cases, 68.2%). Non-adherence in patients was commonly resolved by patient education (59 cases, 60.8%). Only 5 or more chronic medications taken were found to be associated with the presence of DRP in multivariate analysis (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05).Greater understanding of DRP will enable early detection and appropriate management of DRP, thereby improving patient care for elderly patients with cancer.",

The current study describes longitudinal changes in quality of life among a multimorbid cohort of US Veterans diagnosed and treated for colorectal cancer.A sample of 68 multimorbid adults with colon and/or rectal cancer who received one or more treatment options (surgery, chemo or radiation therapy) was recruited. Participants were not excluded by cancer stage unless they reported being in hospice or similar status. Comprehensive assessments of quality of life and treatment side-effects were conducted 6, 12, and 18\u00a0months after diagnosis. Descriptive statistics characterized treatment side-effects and changes in quality-of-life domains longitudinally. Multivariate Analysis of Variance identified sociodemographic and clinical variables associated with quality of life changes.Many physical symptoms improved from 6 to 18\u00a0months following diagnosis, while some remained stable. Sexual symptoms worsened, attributable to increasing rates of dysfunction in older patients. Low education attainment was predictive of worse physical symptoms (F\u00a0=\u00a05.59, p\u00a0=\u00a0.023) and associated with body concerns (F\u00a0=\u00a05.7; p\u00a0=\u00a0.005) over time.

Low education attainment is consistently associated with physical symptoms and body concerns. Cancer stage and chemotherapy are predictive of body concerns, but not physical or sexual symptoms.",

Propensity score matching generated cohorts comparing SABR with either sublobar resection or lobectomy. Costs were determined via claims. Median survival was calculated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated and cost-effectiveness acceptability curves (CEACs) were constructed from joint distribution of incremental costs and effects estimated by non-parametric bootstrap.In comparing SABR to sublobar resection, 5-year total costs were $55,120 with SABR vs. $77,964 with sublobar resection (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and median survival was 3.6\u00a0years with SABR vs. 4.1\u00a0years with sublobar resection (P\u00a0=\u00a00.95). The ICER for sublobar resection compared to SABR was $45,683/life-year gained, yielding a 46% probability that sublobar resection is cost-effective.

This study evaluated this practice, as patients age 80 and older are largely excluded from clinical trials. The primary outcome of interest was overall survival. Secondary outcomes included treatment-related mortality and anthracycline dose intensity.We assembled a cohort of 530 newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients age 80 or older diagnosed within United States Veterans Health Administration. Treatment and survival information were obtained to determine associations between anthracycline use, dose intensity, treatment-related mortality and overall survival.Of the 530 patients, 285 received systemic treatment and 193 received an anthracycline. After controlling for potential confounders, rituximab decreased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.44\u20130.88), while doxorubicin was not significantly associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% CI: 0.64\u20131.17).

     "abstract": "The aim of this study is to identify doctor-related factors determining the decision-making for adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage III colon cancer aged \u2265\u00a075\u00a0years.21 surgeons and 15 medical oncologists from 10 community hospitals were asked to complete a short questionnaire including tick-box questions regarding motives for non-referral/non-treatment, consultation of geriatricians, chemotherapy schemes prescribed and an open question regarding tolerability of chemotherapy.29 medical specialists returned a completed questionnaire (response 81%). The motives for non-referral/non-treatment reported most often were comorbidity/bad general health condition of the patient; surgical complications; and treatment offered but refused by patient/family. 39% of the surgeons and 55% of the medical oncologists reported consultation of a geriatrician in 2\u201330% of their decisions. CAPOX and capecitabine were reported by medical oncologists as the most frequently prescribed regimens. Factors that influenced the decision for monotherapy or combination therapy were comorbidity; general health condition of the patient; and toxicity profile of the chemotherapeutics. In general, medical oncologists defined grade \u2264\u00a02 toxicities as tolerable, with the exception of neuropathy, for which grade \u2264\u00a01 toxicity was accepted.In case medical oncologists prescribe adjuvant chemotherapy to elderly patients with stage III colon cancer, the chemotherapy schemes used are in line with clinical guidelines and they agree on acceptable levels of toxicity. However, the variation among surgeons and medical oncologists in motives for non-referral, non-treatment and consultation of geriatricians when deciding on adjuvant chemotherapy for elderly patients with stage III colon cancer, shows the complexity and need for specific knowledge.",

     "abstract": "With the ageing of society, optimising decision-making for older patients with cancer becomes increasingly important. A first step is awareness of current clinical practice. We analysed how treatment decisions regarding chemotherapy for older and younger patients with colorectal cancer are currently being made by the multidisciplinary team, the oncologist and the patient.A total of 316 patients with colorectal cancer (median age 68.3\u00a0years), discussed at the multidisciplinary gastrointestinal oncology team meetings between 2010 and 2013, were reviewed to select patients for whom guidelines recommended chemotherapy. Multidisciplinary decision-making and subsequent clinical course were extracted from medical files.The multidisciplinary team recommended chemotherapy in 97% of younger patients treated with curative intent, compared to 65% of older patients; 86% of younger patients and 42% of older patients subsequently received chemotherapy. In a palliative setting, the multidisciplinary team recommended chemotherapy in 98% of younger and 69% of older patients and 81% and 45%, respectively, subsequently received this treatment. In addition to comorbidity and the patient\u2019s physical condition, chronological age was an important reason for withholding chemotherapy. When older patients did receive chemotherapy, reduced intensity regimens were often effectuated.Multidisciplinary decision-making regarding chemotherapy for older patients with colorectal cancer is still frequently based on clinical impressions, preconceptions or chronological age alone. Rather, treatment decisions should be made after thorough evaluation of the patient\u2019s health status across multiple domains, either by a geriatrician or within the oncology team itself. Given the preference-sensitive nature of chemotherapy decisions in the elderly, shared decision-making should be strived for whenever possible.",

We performed subgroup analyses according to age.Between December 2004 and June 2007, 127 patients were enrolled. Analyses were performed between the two subgroups aged <\u00a070\u00a0years (younger, n\u00a0=\u00a056) and \u2265\u00a070\u00a0years (older, n\u00a0=\u00a071). Patients mainly had adenocarcinoma (46% young vs. 51%: elderly), of which 62% vs. 75% had a PS of 2, respectively. Significantly more elderly patients were women and non-smokers, and there was a non-significant trend towards more PS-2 among the elderly. Progression-free survival (PFS) was 1.4\u00a0months (95% CI: 1.1\u20131.9) for younger compared to 2.3\u00a0months (95% CI: 2.1\u20132.9) for elderly patients. Overall survival (OS) was 2.0\u00a0months (95% CI: 1.5\u20132.4) and 3.7\u00a0months (95% CI: 2.4\u20134.8), respectively. Toxicity did not differ between younger and older patients. NSCLC was better controlled in elderly patients after three cycles of monotherapy compared to younger patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034). When adjusted for stratification criteria, age was the main prognostic factor for PFS. Adjusted HRs for PFS was 0.57 (95% CI: 0.38\u20130.85) for the elderly compared to patients aged <\u00a070\u00a0years (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004).Older patients had a decreased risk of progression/death compared to younger patients.

While the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score (albumin, lactate dehydrogenase [LDH], number of metastatic sites) is validated in this setting, its utility among the elderly is uncertain.A total of 296 consecutive patients who were treated in 20 phase I trials from 2005 to 2012 in our unit were analysed. Clinical characteristics and outcomes between young (<\u00a065, n\u00a0=\u00a0202) and older patients (\u2265\u00a065, n\u00a0=\u00a094) were compared.The median age of the older patients was 69\u00a0years (65\u201384) and 71% were males. Although elderly patients had more co-morbidities and lower albumin levels at baseline, there was no significant difference in survival (8.8\u00a0months versus 9.9\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.68) and clinical benefit rate (69% versus 56%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.07) compared to younger patients after median follow-up of 7.1\u00a0months (0.36\u201350.6\u00a0months). Age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.23) did not have any bearing on occurrence of grade 3/4 toxicities. Twenty-six percent of elderly patients experienced grade 3/4 toxicities.

However, receipt of preventive care was not optimal among older cancer survivors with only 51.2% of the female cancer survivors received a mammogram, 63.8% of all the cancer survivors received colonoscopy, and 42.5% had BMD testing.

Patients were first asked how age and multimorbidity influence their cancer screening decisions. After showing them an educational prompt that explained the relationship between life expectancy and the benefits of cancer screening, respondents were then asked about screening in the context of specific health scenarios. Using grounded theory, three independent readers coded responses for salient themes. Sample size was determined by thematic saturation.Most respondents (26 of 28) initially indicated that their overall health or medical conditions do not influence their cancer screening decisions. After viewing the educational prompt, respondents described two broad approaches to cancer screening in the setting of increasing age or multi-morbidity. The first was a \u201cbenefits versus harms\u201d approach in which participants weighed direct health benefits (e.g. reducing cancer incidence or mortality) and harms (e.g. complications or inconvenience). The second was a heuristic approach. Some heuristics favored screening, such as a persistent belief in unspecified benefits from screening, value of knowledge about cancer status, and not wanting to \u201cgive up\u201d, whereas other heuristics discouraged screening, such as fatalism or a reluctance to learn about their cancer status.When considering cancer screening, some older persons with MCC employ heuristics which circumvent the traditional quantitative comparison of risks and benefits, providing an important challenge to informed decision making.",

Although evidence-based guidelines for lung cancer care have been published, lack of high quality care still remains a concern among the elderly. This study comprehensively evaluates the variations in guideline-concordant lung cancer care among elderly in the US.Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (2002\u20132007), we identified elderly patients (aged \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years) with lung cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a042,323) and categorized them by receipt of guideline-concordant care, using evidence-based guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians. A hierarchical generalized logistic model was constructed to identify variables associated with receipt of guideline-concordant care. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis and Log Rank test were used for estimation and comparison of the three-year survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to estimate lung cancer mortality risk associated with receipt of guideline-discordant care.Only less than half of all patients (44.7%) received guideline-concordant care in the study population. The likelihood of receiving guideline-concordant care significantly decreased with increasing age, non-white race, higher comorbidity score, and lower income. Three-year median survival time significantly increased (exceeded 487\u00a0days) in patients receiving guideline-concordant care. Adjusted lung cancer mortality risk significantly increased by 91% (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.91, 95% CI: 1.82\u20132.00) among patients receiving guideline-discordant care.This study highlights the critical need to address disparities in receipt of guideline-concordant lung cancer care among elderly.

For role functioning (i.e. ability to perform daily activities) after rectal cancer treatment, scores were \u2212\u00a018% (range \u2212\u00a039% to \u2212\u00a02%), \u2212\u00a08% (range \u2212\u00a023% to +\u00a06%) and \u2212\u00a05% (range \u2212\u00a017% to +\u00a010%) respectively. Elderly patients experience the greatest and most persistent decline in self-care capacity (up to 61% at one year). This systematic review demonstrates that both physical functioning and role functioning are significantly affected by colorectal cancer surgery. Although initial losses are recovered partially during follow-up, there is a permanent loss in both aspects of physical capacity, in patients of all ages but especially in the elderly. This aspect should be included in patient counselling regarding surgery.",

We report the targeted needs assessment, content, and evaluation tools for our geriatric oncology curriculum at MD Anderson Cancer Center.A team comprising a geriatrician, a medical oncologist, an oncology PharmD, an oncology advanced nurse practitioner, and two oncology chief fellows developed the geriatric oncology curriculum. First, a general needs assessment was conducted by reviewing the literature and medical societies' publications and by consulting experts. A targeted needs assessment was then conducted by reviewing the fellows' evaluations of the geriatric oncology rotation and by interviewing fellows and recently graduated oncology faculty.Geriatric assessment, pharmacology, and psychosocial knowledge skills were the three identified areas of educational need. Curriculum objectives and an evaluation checklist were developed to evaluate learners in the three identified areas. The checklist content was validated by consulting experts in the field. Online materials, including a curriculum, a geriatric pharmacology job aid, and pharmacology cases, were also developed and delivered as part of the curriculum.An interprofessional team approach was a successful method for identifying areas of learners' educational needs, which in turn helped us develop an integrated geriatric oncology curriculum. The curriculum is currently being piloted and evaluated.",

However, there is significant potential for morbidity, and even mortality, with these treatments necessitating tools to risk stratify elderly patients to optimize the safety and benefit of treatments and alternative strategies in situations where the potential risks are likely to outweigh the potential benefits. This review considers the current standard treatments for advanced bladder cancer, approaches to risk stratify elderly patients, and highlights our relatively poor knowledge base regarding the optimal care of elderly patients with this disease.",

Cancer and its treatments lead to cancer-related fatigue and many other side effects, in turn, creating substantial global side-effect burden (total burden from all side effects) which, ultimately, compromises functional independence and quality of life. Various modes of exercise, such as yoga, reduce cancer-related fatigue and global side-effect burden in younger cancer survivors, but no studies have specifically examined the effects of yoga on older cancer survivors.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of a 4-week yoga intervention (Yoga for Cancer Survivors: YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae) on overall cancer-related fatigue, and due to its multidimensional nature, the subdomains of cancer-related fatigue (general, physical, emotional, and mental) and global side-effect burden in older cancer survivors.We conducted a secondary analysis on data from a multicenter phase III randomized controlled clinical trial with 2 arms (standard care and standard care plus a 4-week YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae intervention). The sample for this secondary analysis was 97 older cancer survivors (\u2265\u00a060\u00a0years of age), between 2\u00a0months and 2\u00a0years post-treatment, who participated in the original trial.Participants in the YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae intervention arm reported significantly lower cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden than participants in the standard care arm following the 4-week intervention period (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).YOCAS\u00a9\u00ae is an effective standardized yoga intervention for reducing cancer-related fatigue, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, and global side-effect burden among older cancer survivors.",

From the trial protocol, data were extracted on trial characteristics and outcome measures.Of 127 trials, 81% formulated one or more stringent criteria with respect to organ function; 32% excluded patients with WHO performance status (PS) 2 and 83% with PS3. Functional outcomes, health care utilisation, cognitive function after treatment, and quality of life were reported in 6%, 3%, 6%, and 31% of trials, respectively. In only 16% of trials on palliative cancer treatment, a geriatric assessment was performed at baseline.Although recent years have seen a growing evidence base regarding fit older patients, our study suggests a lack of representative cohorts of older patients and patient-centred outcome measures in current palliative treatment trials for the elderly. Research addressing alternative outcome measures, including quality of life and impact of therapy on general functioning, cognition, and preservation of independence, and incorporation of a geriatric assessment are needed to provide elderly patients with cancer and their treating physicians with realistic information about palliative chemotherapy.",

However, 9 patients were excluded due to follow-up less than 1\u00a0year. The prognostic factors in the remaining 438 patients were studied.Among the 438 patients, 311 (71%) had only loco-regional disease (M0) and 127 (29%) had distant metastases (M1) at the time of initial presentation. The host factors predictive of distant metastases at presentation were female gender, primary tumor size (>\u00a04\u00a0cm), follicular histology, and extra-thyroidal extension. Among Mo patients, 195 (63%) achieved complete remission while only 12 (9%) M1 patients did so. Average number of radioactive iodine (131I) doses administered to achieve complete remission was 2.3 (range, 1\u20136) and the mean cumulative dose was 3404\u00a0MBq (range, 925\u201346,250\u00a0MBq). In multivariate logistic regression among M0 patients, follicular histology, nodal metastases, and surgical treatment lesser than total/near-total thyroidectomy and among M1 patients, site of distant metastases (skeletal and multiple sites) were independent factors predicting non-remission. Among the patients (both M0 and M1) who achieved remission, factors associated with disease recurrence were primary tumor size (>\u00a04\u00a0cm), nodal metastases, pulmonary metastases, and non-remission after first dose of radioactive iodine and were associated with greater chances of disease relapse.This study highlights that DTC in older patients behaves more aggressively than in adults age\u00a0<\u00a060\u00a0years, and identifies several prognostic factors for remission and subsequent relapse.",

Their clinical characteristics were reviewed and analyzed. Comorbidity status was evaluated using Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and simplified comorbidity score (SCS).A total of 576 patients were included in this analysis. Four hundred and nineteen patients (72.7%) received systemic therapy, including 182 (31.6%) patients who received chemotherapy, and 237 (41.1%) patients who received epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) as initial treatment.

A pilot study involving women aged \u2265\u00a070\u00a0years newly diagnosed with early operable primary breast cancer was conducted aiming to explore the potential value of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA).Decision of primary treatment followed consultation with the clinical team and was not guided by any aspect of this study. CGA, using a validated cancer-specific tool, was conducted within 6\u00a0weeks and 6\u00a0months after diagnosis, complemented by formal measures of quality of life (QOL) (using EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-BR23) and semi-structured interviews. A total of 47 female patients with a new diagnosis of clinically early (stage 1 or 2; cT0-2N0-1M0) operable primary breast cancer proven histologically, were recruited.CGA determined that increasing age (\u2265\u00a080\u00a0years) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001), greater (\u2265\u00a04) comorbidity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022), greater number (\u2265\u00a04) of daily medications (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002), and slower (\u2265\u00a019\u00a0s) timed up and go (TUG) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) score were significantly related to non-surgical treatment at 6\u00a0weeks after diagnosis.Baseline QOL scores were generally good and they remained stable at 6\u00a0months follow-up. As opposed to CGA, there was no correlation between QOL scores and the treatment modality identified. Semi-structured interviews identified themes consistent with findings from QOL assessment.The pilot study confirmed the feasibility of conducting CGA in a research setting which appeared to have value in assessing this patient population. More data will be required to definitively identify the components for geriatric assessment in this setting. The study has now extended into two more centres.",

Eligible studies included cohort or case-control studies or clinical trials in which all patients, or a subgroup of patients, had a diagnosis of cancer and in which falls were either the primary or secondary outcome.We identified 31 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Several studies suggest that falls are more common in older adults with a diagnosis of cancer than those without. Among the 11 studies that explored factors associated with outpatient falls, some risk factors for falls established in the general population were also associated with falls in older adults with cancer, including dependence in activities of daily living and prior falls. Other factors associated with falls in a general population, such as age, polypharmacy and opioid use, were not predictive of falls among oncology populations. Falls among older adults with cancer in the inpatient setting were associated with established risk factors for falls in people without cancer, but also with factors unique to an oncology population, such as brain metastases.Falls in older adults with cancer are more common than in the general population, and are associated with risk factors unique to people with cancer. Further study is needed to establish methods of screening older adults with cancer for fall risk and ultimately implement interventions to reduce their risk of falls. Identifying which older adults with cancer are at greater risk for falls is a requisite step to ultimately intervene and prevent falls in this vulnerable population.",

FS was lower in all cancer groups, except prostate, compared to the cancer-free group (Model 1: lung \u2212\u00a04.76, breast \u2212\u00a02.28, colorectal \u2212\u00a02.55; Model 2: lung \u2212\u00a02.36, breast \u2212\u00a02.46, colorectal \u2212\u00a02.31). Predictors of decreased FS score independent of cancer diagnosis included low education, comorbidities, obesity, smoking, lack of health insurance, and age.FS in all incident cancer groups declined during the first year post-diagnosis, which could be due to intensive treatments. Targeting factors related to FS declines could improve health outcomes for patients with cancer.",

     "abstract": "Optimal treatment strategies in frail and/or elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have not been well defined. Using data from a prospective, phase II study of elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with bevacizumab and capecitabine, we explored the differences in functional measure and quality of life (QoL) between patients with ECOG performance status (PS) 1 and 2.Geriatric functional measures included patient reported limitations in ADLs and IADLs, ECOG PS, 3-item recall, hearing acuity, and the \u201cGet up and Go\u201d test. QoL was assessed by means of the FACT-C questionnaire and the EQ-5D questionnaire. The prognostic impact of baseline characteristics on survival was studied using univariate Cox regression analysis.The majority (62%) of the 45 patients had an ECOG PS of 2. The ECOG PS 2 group had more limitations in IADLs, lower baseline QoL, and a lower patient-rated health score. For all participants, QoL significantly improved from baseline to the start of cycle 2 (FACT-C: 99.9 vs. 105.4, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and did not deteriorate when baseline scores were compared to when participants went off study (FACT-C: 99.9 vs. 98.6, p\u00a0=\u00a00.59). In the Cox-regression analysis, a positive \u201cGet up and Go\u201d test was prognostic for improved survival (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.31, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).There is significant heterogeneity in functional measures and quality of life among elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with ECOG PS 1 and 2. The \u201cGet up and Go\u201d test may be a useful prognostic indicator for survival in this population.",

We assessed clinical, pathological and molecular features of CRC with early and late mortality in such patients.Data were analysed in relation to early mortality and long-term survival in 90 consecutive patients with CRC aged 85\u00a0years or older in a single hospital.Patients not undergoing operation, those with an ASA score of III or greater and those with advanced tumour stage were more likely to die within 30\u00a0days.

A combined \u201csenescence score\u201d was generated using principal component analysis to measure the combined effect of the senescence-associated gene signature.An elevated senescence score correlated with older age (r\u00a0=\u00a00.37; P\u00a0=\u00a0.01) as well as a higher degree of malignancy, as determined by WHO, histological grade (r\u00a0=\u00a00.49; P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). There was a mild association with poor prognosis (P\u00a0=\u00a0.06). Gliosarcomas showed the highest scores. Six genes independently correlated with either age (IL-6, TNFRSF-11B, IGFBP-3, SAA4, and COPG), prognosis (IL-6, SAA4), or the grade of the glioma (IL-6, IL-8, ICAM-1, IGFBP-3, and COPG).We report: 1) a novel molecular signature in human gliomas, based on cellular senescence, translating the concept of SAG to human cancer; 2) the senescence signature is composed of genes central to the pathogenesis of gliomas, defining a novel, aggressive subtype of glioma; and 3) these genes provide prognostic biomarkers, as well as targets, for drug discovery and immunotherapy.",

Five distinct social networks were defined using information regarding number and intensity of social contacts: traditional-family (reference category), friends and neighbors, narrow-family, diverse, and attenuated. Cancer was ascertained through the Israel Cancer Registry, and mortality through the Population Registry after 20\u00a0years of follow-up.The final study population included 676 participants diagnosed with cancer after 1985.

We compared incidence/mortality between EE and middle aged (MA; age 50\u201369) patients.Prostate cancer incidence and mortality rose and then, in the early 1990s, declined (\u2212\u00a03.61%/year and \u2212\u00a02.91%/year, respectively) among EE. Prostate cancer incidence rose steadily throughout the study period for MA.

Both age groups experienced an increase and then decrease in colon cancer incidence. The decrease in colon cancer mortality over the last decade was profound for all patients (\u2212\u00a02.88%/year MA, and \u2212\u00a03.29%/year EE). Lung cancer incidence (+\u00a02.35%/year to 2005) and mortality (+\u00a01.25%/year from 1995) increased for EE. Lung cancer incidence and mortality increased and then decreased (\u2212\u00a02.54%/year for mortality from 1990) for MA.Recent trends in incidence and mortality for screened cancers (breast, colon, prostate) show substantial gains for the extreme elderly, likely due in part to the effect of screening.

Data collection comprised of reviewing hospital data, general respondent data, and treating physicians' general experiences and expectations regarding GA. Descriptive statistics were calculated.Eighty-two physicians from 9 hospitals participated. The GA team composition can vary substantially, with a nurse as core member. Ideally, all older patients with cancer in whom a treatment decision is necessary, should benefit from the GA. Nearly all GA domains are reported as very important. Availability of GA results can be improved. Treating physicians want geriatricians to coordinate geriatric recommendations related to the identified GA problems, and expect from trained healthcare workers (THCWs) to collect GA data, to report GA results, and to follow-up the implementation of geriatric recommendations.This study identifies relevant information for improving the implementation of GA in older patients with cancer in Belgium and reveals priorities for a THCW from the treating physician's point of view.

We sought to determine if patients' health care use in the claims is a marker of treatment morbidity.For 249 elderly Medicare patients with breast or colon cancer who were treated in two adjuvant clinical trials, we merged patients' National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTC AEs) trial data with their contemporaneous Medicare claims. We estimated associations of patients' grade \u2265\u00a03 CTC AE counts and their use of two types of hospital-based health care in claims (i.e., emergency room (ER) visits and hospitalizations).ER visits and hospitalizations were significantly positively associated with grade \u2265\u00a03 CTC AE counts incurred by patients during the study. Eight percent of patients without any grade \u2265\u00a03 CTC AEs had one or more hospitalizations during the observation period compared to 43% of patients with three or more grade \u2265\u00a03 CTC AEs (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

     "abstract": "Our goal was to evaluate the ability of the hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) to predict outcomes after allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) within the context of an older patient population, where multiple comorbidities are common.We performed a retrospective cohort study of SCT patients \u2265\u00a050\u00a0years of age at our institution, identifying 59 patients with complete HCT-CI data collected prospectively.HCT-CI category distribution in our sample was disproportionate, with almost half of patients having scores \u2265\u00a03. High HCT-CI score (\u2265\u00a03 vs <\u00a03) was associated with significantly inferior OS (median OS not reached for HCT-CI <\u00a03 vs 14\u00a0months for HCT-CI \u2265\u00a03; hazard ratio (HR) 2.2, p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). HCT-CI score was a better predictor of OS than age, performance status or conditioning intensity. When adjusted for disease relapse risk, HCT-CI score conferred a worse prognosis in the low risk group (HR 1.43, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) but not in the intermediate/high risk group (HR 1.08, p\u00a0=\u00a00.65). NRM was low in the total sample (6% at one year) and was not associated with HCT-CI score. Grade 3\u20134 non-hematologic adverse events within the first 100\u00a0days after SCT were significantly more common in the higher HCT-CI groups (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).In our older patient cohort with a high incidence of multiple comorbidities, HCT-CI score \u2265\u00a03 was significantly associated with OS, particularly in the subset of patients with a low disease relapse risk.",

A brief GA tool consisting of valid and reliable measures has been developed; however, little data exist on the ability to perform the GA in community oncology clinics. The objective of this study was to determine the feasibility of performing the GA in the community.Patients aged \u2265\u00a065 were eligible. The GA included a health care provider assessment of performance status, cognitive function, a Timed Up and Go test, and a self-administered patient questionnaire that evaluated measures of functional status, comorbidity, psychological state, social support, and nutritional status.From 2009 to 2013, 1088 patients were assessed including 339 (31%) from seven community clinics across North Carolina. The median amount of time to complete the patient-report portion of the GA was 19\u00a0min in the academic center versus 22\u00a0min in the community. The median amount of time to complete the entire GA was 23\u00a0min in the academic center and 30\u00a0min in community settings. Significantly more patients in the community required assistance completing the questionnaire (24% vs. 14%); however, most patients required no assistance (76%).A brief GA can be performed in community oncology clinics. The time to complete the professional assessments and patient self-assessments were similar in both settings. Future studies are planned to determine if such assessments can improve cancer care for older patients.",

     "abstract": "An oncogeriatric approach may affect management of elderly patients with breast cancer. However, little is known about oncogeriatric care in the metastatic setting. Therefore, we performed an international comparison of management of elderly patients with primary metastatic disease who were treated in two different care settings.Patients who were \u2265\u00a070\u00a0years at diagnosis of primary metastatic disease were eligible. The first cohort comprised a population-based cohort of 104 patients (Comprehensive Cancer Center West, The Netherlands), who all received standard care. The second cohort comprised a hospital-based cohort of 42 patients (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, Florida, United States), who all received oncogeriatric care.No large differences in patient and tumor characteristics were observed between both cohorts. Most patients in the standard care cohort received systemic therapy as primary therapy, whereas most patients in the oncogeriatric cohort received a combination of systemic and local therapy. Patients in the standard care cohort received fewer lines of treatment (mean number of treatments 2.1 vs. 3.6, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and particularly received less breast surgery, chemotherapy, and trastuzumab. Three-year overall mortality was 71% (95% CI: 61\u201383%) as compared to 58% (95% CI: 42\u201375%) among patients in the oncogeriatric care cohort (multivariable HR: 1.59 [95% CI: 0.88\u20132.87], p\u00a0=\u00a00.125).In primary metastatic breast cancer, oncogeriatric care intensifies treatment and might improve survival in elderly patients. Future studies on a larger scale should investigate the potential for improved survival, and whether this is accompanied by a better (preservation of) quality of life and functional status.",

     "abstract": "Breast cancer (BC) in the elderly population is by far the most frequent malignancy in Western countries; however, little evidence is available regarding the specific management of this group. The purpose of this study was to identify how the biological and clinical characteristics of cancer have changed over the past 20\u00a0years by comparing two groups of elderly patients with breast cancer operated on 20\u00a0years apart. The secondary endpoint was to underline potential changes in surgical strategy over the past 20\u00a0years.One group of consecutive elderly patients undergoing surgery for BC between January 1990 and December 1993 (Group A), and one group undergoing surgery between January 2008 and December 2011 (Group B) were identified and analyzed. Data regarding surgical treatment, stage, tumor grading, hormonal and HER2/neu receptors, and Ki-67 were collected and compared.A total of 422 elderly patients underwent surgical treatment, 142 in Group A and 280 in Group B. An earlier stage at presentation was detected in Group B, T1 (57.5% B vs. 31.6% A) and N0 (64.6% B vs. 54.2% A). Surgical treatment in the first group was more extensive while conservative procedures were more frequently performed in the second group. Despite the earlier presentation, tumor grade was higher in Group B (G3 10.6% A vs. 32.1% B, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Overexpression of Ki-67 was again more frequent in Group B (56.2% B vs. 32.5% A, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Hormonal and HER2/neu receptor expression was comparable.Nowadays, elderly patients with BC are more likely to present at an early stage; therefore, conservative surgery is a feasible option. Despite potential bias related to changes of pathology and immunohistochemistry examination techniques over the decades, the biological characteristics of recent patients with BC seem to be consistent with more aggressive tumors. Tailored treatment should be offered with regard to biological age, the cancer-specific profile and active life expectancy.",

We created three measures of pathological fracture (PF), spinal cord compression (SCC), and bone surgery (BS) that differed in the use of claims-based bone metastasis information. We reported covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) using the full sample and a propensity score-matched sample (PSMS).Application of inclusion/exclusion criteria resulted in 7062 men in the full sample (1776 in the PSMS). PCa-specific (all-cause mortality) was 54% (80%) at a median follow-up of 609\u00a0days. SRE prevalence ranged from 9.7% to 17.1% across the measures. In a PCa mortality model, the HR associated with an SRE ranged from 1.07 (0.98\u20131.16) to 1.31 (1.18\u20131.45). The HRs for SCC and PF were statistically significant and positively associated with PCa-specific mortality. The results for BS depended on the measure. Results for SCC and BS, but not for PF, were preserved using a PSMS.The relationship between SREs and mortality among older men with metastatic PCa was driven by SCC and depended on the definition used to measure SREs.",

No previous studies examined potential drug interactions (PDIs) from polypharmacy and their association with chemotherapy tolerance in older patients with cancer.This study is a retrospective medical chart review of 244 patients aged 70\u00a0+ years who received chemotherapy for solid or hematological malignancies. PDI among all drugs, supplements, and herbals taken with the first chemotherapy cycle were screened for using the Drug Interaction Facts software, which classifies PDIs into five levels of clinical significance with level 1 being the highest. Descriptive and correlative statistics were used to describe rates of PDI. The association between PDI and severe chemotoxicity was tested with logistic regressions adjusted for baseline covariates.A total of 769 PDIs were identified in 75.4% patients. Of the 82 level 1 PDIs identified among these, 32 PDIs involved chemotherapeutics. A large proportion of the identified PDIs were of minor clinical significance. The risk of severe non-hematological toxicity almost doubled with each level 1 PDI (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.94, 95% CI: 1.22-3.09), and tripled with each level 1 PDI involving chemotherapeutics (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.08, 95% CI: 1.33-7.12). No association between PDI and hematological toxicity was found.In this convenience sample of older patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy we found notable rates of PDI and a substantial adjusted impact of PDI on risk of non-hematological toxicity.

Multilevel logistic regression models were used to determine whether age remained an independent predictor of adjuvant therapy utilisation after accounting for significant patient, surgeon and hospital characteristics.Overall, 65\u201373% of eligible patients received chemotherapy and 42\u201353% received radiotherapy. Increasing age was strongly associated with decreasing likelihood of receiving chemotherapy for lymph node-positive colon cancer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and radiotherapy for high-risk rectal cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), even after adjusting for confounders such as Charlson comorbidity score and ASA health status. People aged over 70\u00a0years for chemotherapy and over 75\u00a0years for radiotherapy were significantly less likely to receive treatment than those aged less than 65. Emergency resection, intensive care admission, and not having a current partner also independently predicted chemotherapy nonreceipt. Other predictors of radiotherapy nonreceipt included being female, not being discussed at multidisciplinary meeting, and lower T stage. Adjuvant therapy rates varied widely between hospitals where surgery was performed.There are continuing age disparities in adjuvant therapy utilisation in NSW that are not explained by patients' comorbidities or health status. Further exploration of these complex treatment decisions is needed. Variation by hospital and patient characteristics indicates opportunities to improve patient care and outcomes.",

Among these, 20% were age \u2265\u00a075\u00a0years. For DPq3w, there were non-significant associations of worse tolerability and efficacy with advancing age. Twenty-eight percent of men age \u2265\u00a075\u00a0years had an objective pain response, compared to 38% and 34% of patients 65\u201374 and <\u00a065\u00a0years, respectively. There were no significant differences in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response (43\u201348%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.74) or measurable tumor response (7\u201317%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.30) according to age. Among men \u2265\u00a075\u00a0years, DPq3w resulted in more dose reductions than DPq1w (22% versus 8%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.007), but tolerability was otherwise comparable. Both were associated with more favorable efficacy than mitoxantrone.Tolerability and efficacy of DPq3w appear less favorable with advancing age. Compared to DPq1w, DPq3w is associated with better survival outcomes, but similar tolerability, and remains the standard first-line chemotherapy option in mCRPC. Toxicity is substantial, therefore careful patient selection, close monitoring and early management of toxicities is advised.",

     "abstract": "Most men diagnosed with prostate cancer become long-term survivors, but are at risk for medical late-effects that can affect their long-term health. Mailed surveys are well suited to study late-effects in this population, but low response rates can compromise survey validity. This study investigated whether an unconditional $5.00 gift certificate incentive or Priority Mail delivery increased prostate cancer survivors' response to mailed surveys.976 participants (mean age\u00a0=\u00a066.8\u00a0years), 2\u20138\u00a0years post-diagnosis, were randomized to one of four groups: Incentive; Priority Mail; Incentive & Priority Mail; or Control. After an introductory letter, initial study packets were mailed based on randomization; 46\u00a0days later, a second study packet was mailed to all non-responders by First-Class Mail.The first mailing yielded a significant variation in response rates across groups (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a09.34; p\u00a0=\u00a00.025). Priority Mail (64.7%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and Incentive & Priority Mail (63.6%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.016) groups had significantly higher response rates than Controls (52.9%). After the second mailing, the overall response rate increased significantly from 59.6% to 71.4% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); however, response rates no longer differed across groups (range, 69.3% [Incentive group] to 73.9% [Priority Mail group]).Long-term prostate cancer survivors' response rates to mailed surveys increased with the use of Priority Mail and a repeat survey mailing, but the unconditional gift certificate incentive was not supported in this population. By identifying and applying specialized survey methods, studies targeting survivors of prostate cancer and other geriatric cancers may improve response rates, thus limiting a source of potential bias.",

We investigated seven risk factors associated with 30-day and 6-month post-operative mortality from colorectal surgery.6083 patients aged \u2265\u00a060 underwent colorectal cancer surgery. Approximately 8% had died within 30\u00a0days of surgery and 17% had died within 6\u00a0months. Thirty-day mortality was greater in the elderly (80\u00a0years\u00a0+) compared to the young-old (60\u201369\u00a0years) (adjusted OR: 3.2, 95% CI 2.4 to 4.4). There was neither a significant difference between the proportions offered curative resections across the age-groups, nor was there a significant association between intent of surgery and 30-day mortality. Six-month mortality rose with age, but the association was stronger in those having curative surgery (adjusted OR: 3.8, 95% CI 2.8 to 5.2) than palliative surgery (adjusted OR: 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.1). Mortality from emergency surgery at 6-months was particularly high in elderly females.This large population study adds more weight to the findings that age itself is a major risk factor in the outcome of colorectal surgery in elderly and that 30-day mortality underestimates the longer-term outcome in this age group. There was no significant association between radical resections and 30-day mortality in elderly patients compared to the younger age groups; however, a disproportionately higher mortality at 6\u00a0months was seen in elderly female patients.",

This population has large heterogeneity and it is well known that chronologic age is a poor predictor of outcomes. Research has shown that these patients are best served with a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) to formulate individualized treatment plans for better outcomes. However, the best model for CGA has yet to be determined.Our objective was to develop a highly functional model for the establishment of a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric oncology center in the setting of a university based NCI-designated cancer center. Each patient is evaluated by medical oncology, geriatric medicine, pharmacy, social work and nutrition. Expert navigation is provided to enhance the patient experience. At the conclusion, the inter-professional team meets to review each case and formulate a comprehensive treatment plan. The patient is classified as Fit, Vulnerable, or Frail based on the complete CGA.The average age of patients seen was 80.7 with the most common diagnoses being breast, colorectal and lung cancers. Twenty four percent of patients were determined to be Fit, 47% Vulnerable, and 29% Frail. Twenty one percent of patients determined to be Frail by CGA received an ECOG score of 0\u20131 by the oncologist. Our pharmacists made specific recommendations in over 75% of patients and social work provided assistance in over 50% of patients.We were able to observe some interesting trends such as potential discordance with ECOG score and assessment of Fit/Vulnerable/Frail but due to limitations in the data, this paper is not able to illustrate definitive correlations. Several challenges with the development of the clinic include 1) patient related issues, 2) navigation, 3) financial reimbursement, 4) referral patterns, and 5) coordination of care during office hours. We feel that we have been able to establish a model for a comprehensive multidisciplinary geriatric oncology evaluation center in the setting of a university based cancer center.",

About 70% were able to manage their activities of daily living without assistance. Patients on TCM were more likely to have higher number of co-morbidities compared to their counterparts.This is the largest prospective study of CGA assessments done on elderly patients with cancer in Asia. The study demonstrates that CGA provides insights into understanding the needs of elderly Chinese patients with cancer.

A transition zone between the ages of 65 and 70\u00a0years was defined to identify patients with increased reluctance to use internet and electronic devices to exchange HRI and CCC.The data supports that there is an age-defined underutilization of internet and electronic devices to exchange HRI and CCC. Characterization of this age-dependent transition zone will enable clinicians to identify patients who may not interface well with electronic communication strategies, and to improve delivery of HRI and CCC for the elderly.",

Face to face interviews were conducted 6, 12, and 18\u00a0months after diagnosis with the PROMIS scale to assess pain and PHQ-9 scale to assess depression. Descriptive statistics characterized incidence and prevalence of pain impact and intensity ratings.

In younger adults, pain ratings were most associated with lower social support and higher depression, as well as advanced cancer stage. In older adults, pain was multifactorial, associated with baseline comorbidities, adjuvant treatment, and both combat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression.Pain is a significant persisting problem for one in three cancer survivors, requiring ongoing assessment, even months later. Important differences in pain's determinants and impact are present by age group.

     "abstract": "Aging of an individual entails a progressive decline of functional reserves and loss of homeostasis that eventually lead to mortality. This process is highly individualized and is influenced by multiple genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors. This individualization and the diversity of factors influencing aging result in a significant heterogeneity among people with the same chronological age, representing a major challenge in daily oncology practice. Thus, many factors other than mere chronological age will contribute to treatment tolerance and outcome in the older patients with cancer. Clinical/comprehensive geriatric assessment can provide information on the general health status of individuals, but is far from perfect as a prognostic/predictive tool for individual patients. On the other hand, aging can also be assessed in terms of biological changes in certain tissues like the blood compartment which result from adaptive alterations due to past history of exposures, as well as intrinsic aging processes. There are major signs of \u2018aging\u2019 in lymphocytes (e.g. lymphocyte subset distribution, telomere length, p16INK4A expression), and also in (inflammatory) cytokine expression and gene expression patterns. These result from a combination of the above two processes, overlaying genetic predispositions which contribute significantly to the aging phenotype. These potential \u201caging biomarkers\u201d might provide additional prognostic/predictive information supplementing clinical evaluation. The purpose of the current paper is to describe the most relevant potential \u201caging biomarkers\u201d (markers that indicate the biological functional age of patients) which focus on the biological background, the (limited) available clinical data, and technical challenges. Despite their great potential interest, there is a need for much more (validated) clinical data before these biomarkers could be used in a routine clinical setting. This manuscript tries to provide a guideline on how these markers can be integrated in future research aimed at providing such data.",

Prevalence of vulnerability and abnormal G-8 score was 84.2% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 81\u201387.3) and 79.5% (95% CI, 76\u201383). The G-8 was 86.9% sensitive (95% CI, 83.4\u201389.9) and 59.8% specific (95% CI, 48.3\u201370.4). G-8 performance varied significantly (all p values\u00a0<\u00a00.001) across tumour sites (sensitivity, 65.2% in prostate cancer to 95.1% in upper gastrointestinal/liver cancer; and specificity, 23.1% in colorectal cancer to 95.7% in prostate cancer) and metastatic status (sensitivity and specificity, 93.8% and 53.3% in patients with metastases vs. 79.5% and 63.3% in those without, respectively). Differences remained significant after adjustment on age and performance status.These G-8 accuracy variations across tumour sites should be considered when using G-8 to identify elderly patients with cancer who could benefit from CGA.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the Vulnerable Elders Survey-13 (VES-13) score is associated with completion of radiotherapy among elderly patients with cancer.This was a prospective observational study that included patients greater than age 75 with histologically confirmed cancer disease, referred to the Department of Radiation Oncology to receive radical or palliative radiotherapy, from 2010 to 2012. VES-13 forms were filled in before the initiation of radiotherapy and scores were assigned according to a standardized scoring procedure.Of a total of 230 participants (median age 78.5\u00a0years), 41 (17.8%) did not complete radiotherapy. These patients had higher VES-13 scores (median with interquartile range: 5 [2\u20138.5]) compared to those who completed the treatment (3 [1\u20137]; P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). A VES-13 score >\u00a03 was associated with 2.14 times higher probability of not completing radiotherapy, whereas in patients with scores >\u00a07 this probability was 3.34 times higher. The association between higher VES-13 scores and non-completion of radiotherapy was independent of other factors, such as age, sex, comorbidities, type of radiotherapy, and presence of side effects.Patients with higher VES-13 scores had increased probability of not completing radiotherapy in our study, and this effect was independent of other factors that might affect radiotherapy completion.",

No differences were observed in circulating IL-6, VEGF, IGF-1 and free IGF-1. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), IGF-1R expression was significantly higher in tumor vs. normal tissues (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) while IR expression showed no difference. Interestingly, 64% of tumors demonstrated high IR positivity in the vessels within or surrounding the tumor stroma, but not in the vessels away from the tumor. By reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), tumor IGF-1R over-expression (80%) was confirmed, but there was no difference between MS and non-MS patients. Tumor RAGE over-expression was found in 67% of patients and was equally distributed between the two groups.Hyperinsulinemia was the only significant factor distinguishing patients with colorectal cancer who have MS. The preferential over-expression of IR in the peri-tumoral microvessels suggests that hyperinsulinemia might contribute to colorectal cancer growth by enhancing angiogenesis.",

Cancer treatment with chemotherapy can result in many unwanted side effects, including peripheral neuropathy if the drugs are potentially neurotoxic. Peripheral neuropathy and other side effects of chemotherapy may lead to an increased risk of fall-related injuries.We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis using the records of 65,311 patients with breast, colon, lung, or prostate cancer treated with chemotherapy in the SEER-Medicare database from 1994 to 2007. The primary outcome was any fall-related injury defined as a traumatic fracture, dislocation, or head injury within 12\u00a0months of the first dose of chemotherapy. The sample population was divided into 3 cohorts based on whether they most frequently received a neurotoxic doublet, single agent, or a non-neurotoxic chemotherapy. Cox proportional-hazards analyses were adjusted for baseline characteristics to determine the risk of fall-related injuries among the 3 cohorts.The rate of fall-related injuries for patients receiving a doublet of neurotoxic chemotherapy (9.15 per 1000\u00a0person-months) was significantly higher than for those receiving a single neurotoxic agent (7.76 per 1000\u00a0person-months) or a non-neurotoxic agent (5.19 per 1000\u00a0person-months). Based on the Cox proportional-hazards model risk of fall-related injuries was highest for the cohort receiving a neurotoxic doublet after the model was adjusted for baseline characteristics.Among elderly patients with cancer, use of neurotoxic chemotherapy is associated with an increased risk of fall-related injuries.",

     "abstract": "The progressively ageing population combined with an increased availability of antitumoural agents has created a new, challenging therapeutic scenario for oncologists. Due to the lack of evidence-based data on elderly patients it is uncertain whether the criteria for assessing the risk/benefit ratio of treatment strategies in these patients coincide with those classically used for the general population. A critical reevaluation of the role and potential options of systemic chemotherapy in elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is warranted as the historical conservative approach of oncologists may have resulted in undertreatment of this patient population. Bevacizumab was demonstrated to improve the outcome of mCRC patients when used in combination with standard first and second line chemotherapy. However, its toxicity profile including hypertension, thromboembolic events, haemorrhage and proteinuria may raise important concerns when this anti-angiogenic agent is used in elderly patients with comorbidities.In this review article we analyse the available evidence on the safety and effectiveness of bevacizumab in elderly mCRC patients. Based on the data from subgroup or pooled analysis of prospective trials, observational cohort studies, retrospective population-based studies and a single recent randomised phase III trial, we conclude that the clinical benefit and safety profile of bevacizumab in elderly patients are not significantly different from those reported in younger patients, with the exception of an increased risk of arterial thromboembolic events. Bevacizumab should therefore be considered as a potential therapeutic option for elderly patients with mCRC.",

The majority of patients with cancer in the U.S. are currently 65\u00a0years of age or older; therefore, training and research in geriatrics and geriatric oncology are viewed to be integral in meeting the needs of this vulnerable population. Yet, the ways to develop and integrate best geriatrics training within the context of hematology/oncology fellowship remain unclear. Toward this end, the current study seeks to evaluate the prior and current geriatric experiences and perspectives of hematology/oncology fellows. To gain insight into these experiences, focus groups of hematology/oncology fellows were conducted. Emergent themes included: 1) perceived lack of formal geriatric oncology didactics among fellows; 2) a considerable amount of variability exists in pre-fellowship geriatric experiences; 3) shared desire to participate in a geriatric oncology-based clinic; 4) differences across training levels in confidence in managing older adults with cancer; and 5) identification of specific criteria on how best to approach older adults with cancer in a particular clinical scenario. The present findings will help guide future studies in evaluating geriatrics among hematology/oncology fellows across institutions.

     "abstract": "The past decade has seen unprecedented advancements in our ability to treat patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. When applying these advances\u2014hepatic resection and multi-agent chemotherapy\u2014to the care of older patients, it is essential to first perform some assessment of function beyond performance status and to elicit feedback from the patient about how he/she values quality versus quantity of life. For robust older patients with potentially surgically resectable oligometastatic cancer, we recommend a standard approach of surgery with perioperative chemotherapy. However, operative risk increases with age, and careful discussion about prognosis is warranted. For patients with unresectable cancer, first-line chemotherapy with either 5-fluoruracil/leucovorin alone, or with a 20% dose reduced FOLFOX or FOLFIRI regimen, is well tolerated by older patients. Either dose escalation or addition of a second drug can typically be undertaken after 1\u20132\u00a0cycles. First-line bevacizumab with chemotherapy is warranted in those with low risk for atherothrombotic complications. EGFR inhibitors with combination chemotherapy for KRAS wild type cancers offer the best response rates, but toxicity can be difficult and may be best reserved for second-line in all but the fittest elderly. In second-line, we routinely offer continued chemotherapy with the agents that the patient has not yet received. The role of aflibercept and regorafenib has not been well studied in the elderly, but they are both reasonable options for patients with good function and no contraindication. With this cautious approach older patients can be expected to maintain a good quality of life during treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer.",

Logistic and Cox regression were used to examine the association between baseline SRH and treatment toxicity/time to death.There were 112 participants enrolled on this study (median age 74.1). At baseline, 74 patients (66.1%) had a good SRH and 38 patients (33.9%) had poor SRH. Only an increasing number of comorbid conditions was associated with poor SRH at baseline in both univariate and multivariable analysis. We found no association between SRH and toxicity or mortality.A substantial proportion had poor SRH prior to and during cancer treatment. An increasing number of comorbidities was associated with poor SRH at baseline. SRH did not predict toxicity or mortality. Attention to comorbid conditions in older patients with cancer is warranted considering their impact on SRH in this population.",

However, survival and other outcomes in older patients with head/neck cancer receiving chemoradiotherapy are not well established. This study was performed to elucidate selected outcomes in this patient population.Retrospective study of LA-HNC patients \u2265\u00a070\u00a0years of age who had received 5-fluorouracil-hydoxyurea-based CRT with a minimum of 3\u00a0years of follow up after therapy initiation was performed. Pre-treatment patient- and cancer-related characteristics were recorded. Survival data in addition to gastrostomy tube utilization, swallowing function, and hematologic toxicity were captured.Eighty-nine patients treated between 1997 and 2009 were eligible for analysis (median age, 76\u00a0years; range, 70\u201394; male, 61%; ECOG PS, 0\u20131 43%; stage IVA/B, 71%). 86 were evaluable for survival analysis. 5-year overall and event-free survival were both at 32% with a median follow-up time of 39.2\u00a0months. The majority (86.5%) were able to complete all planned treatment cycles. A significant proportion of patients, however, required gastrostomy tube during CRT (62%) and developed aspiration during swallowing evaluation post-treatment (44%). Several patients required hospice (9%) or skilled nursing facility (13%) referrals during treatment.Select older adults with LA-HNC can still experience long-term benefits despite 5-year survival rates lower than those historically reported in younger patients undergoing identical CRT regimens although potentially at higher risk for acute toxicities. Assessment and selection of those who can tolerate more intense combined-modality strategies and their long-term outcomes merit further larger, prospective studies.",

A new predictive model for grade 3\u20135 chemotherapy toxicities was developed by Hurria et al. (2011).1 As the model is from the Cancer and Aging Research Group (CARG), we call it the CARG toxicity tool. We investigated whether this tool can usefully characterize chemotherapy risks for older patients with lung cancer.Patients from our hospital aged \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years with lung cancer completed a questionnaire form prior to chemotherapy. We reviewed patients' chemotherapy courses to identify toxicities, and used the toxicity tool to score the patients' outcomes. The sample was divided into three risk strata based on approximate risk score quartiles, with the middle two quartiles combined. Chi-square statistics were used to verify differences among groups.Between September 2011 and September 2012, 120 patients with lung cancer (87 males and 33 females) \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years of age (mean: 69\u00a0years; range: 65\u201382\u00a0years) were enrolled in the study.

Toxicity varied significantly among the risk groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), but the incidence of toxicity did not vary significantly among the KPS-based risk groups (P\u00a0=\u00a00.322).This new CARG toxicity tool can be used to better distinguish the risks of chemotherapy toxicity than the KPS for older patients with lung cancer, and may change the standards for oncology assessments.",

Women in the RCT reported an adjusted mean increase of 13.7 points (95% CI 10.2, 17.1) in global QoL at 24\u00a0months (vs. mid-treatment), while women treated off-trial had only an adjusted improvement of 7.0 points (95% CI 3.5, 10.4; p\u00a0=\u00a0.007 for difference in mean changes). Women in the RCT had significantly greater improvement in emotional function than those treated off-trial, controlling for baseline; they also had greater reductions in therapy side effects and fatigue at 24\u00a0months than women off-trial, controlling for covariates.There may be different QoL trajectories for older women undergoing breast cancer chemotherapy on- vs. off-trial. If confirmed, the results suggest that the extra monitoring and communication within an RCT could provide the infrastructure for interventions to address symptoms and improve QoL for the growing older cancer population.",

We report the prevalence of HER2 amplification in elderly women using only FISH.We retrospectively identified women 65\u00a0years and older undergoing core biopsy, lumpectomy or mastectomy for primary breast malignancy at a single institution between 2009 and 2011. Data collected included age, histopathological type, hormone receptor status, and HER2 status. Descriptive statistics were performed using SAS Software, Version 9.2.One hundred fifty-eight women were included in the study. Most had invasive ductal carcinoma (74.7%), and were positive for either estrogen (ER) or progesterone (PgR) receptors (82.3% and 70.0%, respectively). Only 17% were negative for both ER and PgR; 11.4% were triple negative. Nineteen samples (12.0%) were positive for HER2. In univariate analyses, hormone receptor and HER2 status did not vary with age. When stratified by age, 60% of women with hormone receptor/HER2 positive tumors were younger than 70\u00a0years, compared with 22.2\u201333.3% of women in other subgroups. The difference was not statistically significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.20).This study adds to the knowledge of the biology of breast cancer in elderly women.

     "abstract": "In general, geriatric assessment (GA) provides the combined information on comorbidity and functional, nutritional and psychosocial status and may be predictive for mortality outcome of cancer patients. The impact of geriatric assessment on the outcome of older patients with colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy is largely unknown.In a prospective study, 143 patients with colorectal cancer who were 70\u00a0years and older were assessed before chemotherapy by Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE), Groningen Frailty Indicator (GFI) and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE).Fifty-four (38%) patients received adjuvant chemotherapy and 89 (62%) patients received palliative chemotherapy. Malnutrition and frailty were prevalent in 39 (27%, assessed by MNA) and 34 (24%, by GFI) patients, respectively; whereas cognitive impairment was prevalent in 19 (13%, by IQCODE) and 11 (8%, by MMSE) patients, respectively. In patients with palliative chemotherapy, poor MNA scores were associated with receiving less than 4\u00a0cycles of chemotherapy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Poor MNA and GFI scores were associated with increased hazard ratios (HR) for mortality for patients with palliative chemotherapy: HR\u00a0=\u00a02.76 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.60-4.77; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and HR\u00a0=\u00a02.72 (95% CI: 1.58\u20134.69; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), respectively, after adjustment for several clinical parameters.Malnutrition and frailty were strongly associated with an increased mortality risk in patients who underwent palliative chemotherapy. Furthermore, a poor score on MNA was predictive for less tolerance of chemotherapy. Our findings may help the oncologist in future decision making and advice for elderly patients with colorectal cancer.",

A total of 902 (96.3%) questionnaires were completed by the treating physicians. In 381/902 patients (42.2%) clinical assessment led to a different treatment decision compared to younger patients without co-morbidities. This difference was most prominent for chemotherapy/targeted therapy decisions. In 505/902 cases (56%) the treating physician consulted GA results before the final treatment decision. In these patients, the treatment decision was influenced by clinical assessment in 44.2%. In 31/505 patients (6.1%) the GA further influenced treatment, mostly concerning chemotherapy/targeted therapy. In eight patients GA influenced the physician to choose a more aggressive chemotherapy.Physicians use different treatment regimens in older versus younger patients, based on clinical assessment, including age. GA results further influence treatment decisions in a minority of patients and may trigger the use of less aggressive as well as more aggressive treatments. GA information is not always utilized by oncologists, indicating the need for better education and sensitization.",

In addition, baseline and longitudinal data captured demographics and vital status, respectively.Among 292 patients, 185 (63%) reported that they perceived themselves as younger than their actual age, 45 as older (15%), and 56 (19%) as the same age (unable to be determined in 6). The mean actual chronological age (standard deviation) among those who perceived themselves as younger, older, or the same age was 63\u00a0years (11), 54 (12), and 60 (10); (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

Improved survival was associated with fewer symptoms and the potential for curing the cancer, but not with patients' age perceptions. Qualitative themes such as positive thinking, staying engaged with life, the importance of family, and maintaining a sense of humor emerged among those who felt younger.A substantial percentage of patients with cancer \u2013 particularly older ones \u2013 report feeling younger than their actual age; this perception appears to have no relevance to symptoms or survival.",

The purpose of this study was to assess the patterns of care of older HNSCC patients to better understand how age is associated with treatment decisions.Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database (1992\u20132007), we identified patients with non-metastatic HNSCC (n\u00a0=\u00a010,867) and categorized them by treatment: surgery vs. non-surgery and chemoradiotherapy (CRT) vs. radiotherapy (RT).

Conducting a CGA, however, is time-consuming, requiring extensive data collection and, in some cases, the involvement of multiple healthcare professionals. The CGA is also not specifically targeted towards assessing patients presenting with neoplastic pathologies. These limitations have precluded this tool's inclusion in routine oncologic practice involving seniors. In order to identify CGA domains most predictive of important cancer-specific outcomes, we conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO registration number CRD42012002476) using MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE and CANCERLIT databases. Studies published in English or French between May 1997 and May 2012, in which a CGA was conducted in patients over the age of 65 initiating cancer treatment, were assessed for eligibility, of which 9 studies were selected for this review. As part of the inclusion criteria, all studies must have assessed, at minimum, the following domains: nutritional, cognitive and functional status, polypharmacy, comorbidities and the presence of geriatric syndromes. In predicting mortality, in at least one study or another, all of the aforementioned CGA domains were found to be significant. Most frequently, however, the following domains were reported for predicting mortality: nutritional status (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.84\u20132.54), the presence of geriatric syndromes such as depression (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.51\u20131.81), and functional status (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.04\u20131.33). With regards to chemotherapy-related toxicity, similar findings were obtained where functional status (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.71\u20132.47) and the presence of geriatric syndromes, such as impaired hearing (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.67, 95% CI 1.04\u20132.69), had the most significant predictive value.

     "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related mortality worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all cases. Half of the patients at diagnosis of NSCLC are over seventy years old; therefore, the elderly represent a large subgroup of patients affected by advanced NSCLC in our clinical practice. Nevertheless, the elderly are under-represented in clinical trials. Given the fact that old age is frequently associated with several comorbidities, poor general conditions and physiologic reduction in organ function, clinicians must carefully choose the best treatment option for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC, always taking into account the expected risks and benefits. In this paper we perform a review of literature evidence regarding the medical treatment of elderly patients affected by advanced NSCLC, encompassing single-agent chemotherapy, doublet chemotherapy and targeted agents. We conclude that single-agent chemotherapy with a third generation agent (vinorelbine, taxanes, gemcitabine) represents a valid treatment option for elderly patients who are not eligible for a combination chemotherapy due to clinical features such as comorbidities, poor performance status and inadequate organ function. Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy shows similar efficacy in elderly patients as compared to their younger counterpart, despite greater treatment related toxicity and it is indicated in elderly patients with ECOG PS: 0\u20132, adequate organ function and no major comorbidities. Elderly patients affected by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutated NSCLC benefit mostly from a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of EGFR (erlotinib, gefitinib) which is associated with a good toxicity profile. Currently there are no available data to strongly support the use of bevacizumab in combination with first line chemotherapy in the treatment of older adults. Elderly patients affected by NSCLC harboring the EML4-ALK translocation could benefit mostly from a treatment with an oral inhibitor of such a rearrangement (crizotinib).",

Esophageal cancer-management in the elderly is challenging because of the morbidity and mortality associated with surgery.We examined a strategy of neo-adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy (naCRT), followed by surgery or surveillance, in selected patients with cancer aged 70 and older.A prospectively-accrued database identified 56 consecutive patients over a 90-month period, who were aged 70\u00a0years and over, presented with esophageal carcinoma and were treated with neo-adjuvant CRT (naCRT)\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0surgery.Of 129 eligible patients, 66 (51%) received palliative measures, while 63 (49%) had curative intervention, namely 7 had surgery and 56 had naCRT \u00b1 surgery. Of these 56 patients, 33 (59%) had adenocarcinoma (AC) and 23 (41%) had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Twenty-five (45%) had a complete clinical response (cCR), of which 6 had immediate resection; 4 (67%) had a complete pathological response (pCR); 19 patients with a cCR declined or were unfit for surgery and underwent surveillance; of these, 3 had interval esophagectomy; 16 were not offered or declined resection. Eight (50%) have survived \u2265\u00a03\u00a0years.

In cCRs, surgery did not provide a survival advantage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.861).cCR yields an overall 3-year survival of 50% without operation. As 45% of patients have a cCR to naCRT, obligatory resection in high-risk cCR patients makes little sense. With the option for salvage esophagectomy in re-emergent disease, this selective strategy is an attractive alternative for elderly patients with cancer.",

We designed a risk-adapted, dose escalation study of weekly docetaxel in the first-line treatment of elderly patients with cancer in order to determine the optimal dose according to age, comorbidity and functional status.Sixty-eight patients aged 70 or more were stratified into three risk groups according to a combination of age, performance status, and comorbidity. The study was conducted using a standard phase I design with sequential cohorts of patients receiving docetaxel at increasing doses in each risk group.The maximum tolerated dose was not reached in the intermediate-risk group and was 45\u00a0mg/m2/week in the high-risk group. Because of a slow recruitment rate, it was not possible to conclude the trial in the good-risk category. Neutropenia, asthenia and diarrhea were the most frequently encountered severe toxicities.Docetaxel can be used at a dose of 40\u00a0mg/m2/week as a first-line treatment for elderly patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer without excessive toxicity. The risk groups defined in the study are not able to accurately distinguish between subgroups of patients with divergent toxicity profiles.",

     "abstract": "Clinical outcomes in older adults with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) are poorly understood, particularly in the era of targeted therapies. We characterize survival and relevant treatment-related variables in a modern series.From an institutional database including 562 patients with RCC, a total of 219 patients with metastatic disease were identified for the current analysis. Survival was assessed in four age-based cohorts: (1) age\u00a0<\u00a055, (2) age 55\u201364, (3) age 65\u201374, and (4) age\u00a0\u2265\u00a075. The number of lines of therapy rendered was collected for each patient, and the reason for treatment discontinuation was characterized.Of the 219 patients assessed, median age was 58 (range, 26\u201387), and most patients had clear cell histology (82%) and prior nephrectomy (70.9%). The majority of patients were characterized as intermediate-risk (53%) by MSKCC criteria. Median survival in patients age\u00a0\u2265\u00a075 was 12.5\u00a0months, as compared to 26.4\u00a0months for patients age\u00a0<\u00a075 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Patients age\u00a0\u2265\u00a075 received fewer lines of systemic therapy as compared to other age-based subsets, and more frequently discontinued therapies due to toxicity.Older adults represent a unique subpopulation of patients with mRCC, with distinct clinical outcomes. Further research is warranted to better understand the safety and tolerability of current therapies for mRCC in this group.",

Less is known about the survival prospects in older people, if first-line therapy fails. This study aimed to provide additional information regarding prognosis in this group.Databases were collated from three randomized trials of first-line therapy in those aged 60 and over, deemed fit enough for standard therapy. Overall survival from the point of treatment failure was calculated and comparisons were made between age groups and types of treatment failure.Overall survival (OS) at 2\u00a0years in 862 patients was 46%, 38%, 37% and 23%, respectively, for those aged 60\u201364, 65\u201369, 70\u201374 and >\u00a074. Type of treatment failure impacted on 2\u00a0year OS as follows: initial partial remission (PR): 48%; complete response (CR) with late relapse: 37%; CR with early relapse: 17%; and less than PR to initial therapy: 12%.Older patients failing first-line therapy for DLBCL should be counseled differently regarding prognosis depending upon age and type of treatment failure. The chance of survival was greater in those achieving PR or CR with relapse more than 12\u00a0months from diagnosis. This data may support the consideration of aggressive salvage therapy in fit patients in these categories, regardless of biological age per se. Palliative management may be more appropriate for those achieving less than PR to initial therapy or who enter CR but relapse within one year of diagnosis.",

As a result, no definitive treatment exists for elderly patients, especially less medically fit patients.The objectives of this study are to examine the impact of comorbidities on outcome as well as to compare three different therapeutic regimens in outcome efficacy.We retrospectively identified 143 patients aged >\u00a065 years, who received fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) (n\u00a0=\u00a049), fludarabine and rituximab (FR) (n\u00a0=\u00a074), or rituximab with chlorambucil (R\u2013CLB) (n\u00a0=\u00a020) as first initial immunochemotherapy.At current follow-up (median: 24 months), the proportion of patients with a clinical response was higher with FCR (75%) than FR (57%) and R\u2013CLB (28%). For FCR, FR, and R\u2013CLB patients, 2-year overall survival (OS) was 94%, 76%, and 73%, respectively, (p\u00a0=\u00a00.14), while 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 90%, 58%, and 30% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the fludarabine based regimen (FR and FCR) population, higher rituximab doses (500\u00a0mg/m2 vs. 375\u00a0mg/m2) correlated with prolonged PFS.Despite the retrospective nature of this study, we demonstrate that elderly patients with CLL benefit from frontline immunochemotherapy, and emphasize the importance of maintaining rituximab dose intensity.",

The model was designed to augment information on health status at the point of cancer diagnosis in studies using insurance claims to examine cancer treatment and outcomes.We used data from the 2001\u20132005 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), with observations randomly split into estimation and validation subsamples. We developed an algorithm linking self-reported functional status measures to a DS scale, a proxy for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) PS scale. The DS measure was dichotomized to focus on good [ECOG 0\u20132] versus poor [ECOG 3\u20134] PS. We identified potential claims-based predictors, and estimated multivariate logistic regression models, with poor DS as the dependent measure, using a stepwise approach to select the optimal model. Construct validity was tested by determining whether the predicted DS measure generated by the model was a significant predictor of survival within a validation sample from the MCBS.One-tenth of the beneficiaries met the definition for poor DS. The base model yielded high sensitivity (0.79) and specificity (0.92); positive predictive value\u00a0=\u00a048.3% and negative predictive value\u00a0=\u00a097.8%, c-statistic\u00a0=\u00a00.92 and good model calibration.

All patients were evaluated with both the CDT and Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) as the gold standard. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis was used to determine diagnostic performance. A pre-established algorithm was applied to retrieve Mini-Cog results through a combination of the CDT and the 3-Word Delayed Recall (3-WDR) test (included within MMSE).Data of 105 OG and 116 GG patients were evaluated. Potential cognitive impairment (MMSE\u00a0\u2264\u00a023) was detected in 29.5% and 65.8% of patients, respectively. The CDT showed good diagnostic accuracy in the OG (0.88\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03) and GG (0.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03) group, based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE). CDT (cut-off\u00a0\u2264\u00a04) provided good sensitivity (80.7%) and specificity (81.1%) in the OG group and excellent sensitivity (89.6%) and moderate specificity (51.3%) in the GG group.

Our objective was to determine differences in energy expenditure during rest and activity, body composition, nutrition, and inflammatory markers between healthy elderly females and those with advanced cancer.Twenty elderly (74.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.7\u00a0years) females (9 with solid malignancies, 11 healthy) were evaluated for energy expenditure using indirect calorimetry at rest and throughout a 6-min walk test (6MWT). Body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry); nutritional intake (3-day 24-h food recall); and markers of nutrition and inflammation (complete blood count, albumin and C-reactive protein) were also measured.Compared to healthy controls, patients with cancer had similar energy expenditures, but significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) respiratory quotients at rest. During the 6MWT, the group with cancer walked shorter distances at slower speeds (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), consumed less oxygen (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and trended toward an increased oxygen cost while walking. The patients with cancer ingested fewer calories and presented with higher levels of inflammatory markers (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). No differences in body composition were observed.Early signs of cachexia (i.e. reduced caloric intake, inflammation and greater fat metabolism) may be present in older patients with cancer, along with poorer levels of functional capacity, compared to healthy controls. Timely recognition of these signs may allow therapeutic interventions to better prevent or delay nutritional and functional demise in elderly patients with cancer.",

The date of the first positive blood culture was regarded as the date of bacteremia onset. Primary outcome was the infection related mortality, defined as the death within 14\u00a0days of bacteremia onset.The two most common pathogens responsible for bacteremia were Staphylococcus epidermidis (36.1%) and Escherichia coli (31.5%), with high rates of methicillin resistance and extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) production, respectively. There were no statistically significant differences in infection related mortality rate according to the type of malignancy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.776).

     "abstract": "Lower rates of cancer in the oldest old and in nursing home populations may reflect the increasing prevalence of frailty and a diminished capacity to sustain cancer cell growth and proliferation. This study aimed to determine cancer incidence in the frail relative to non-frail community resident older adults.Data from 3969 participants free of diagnosed cancer at the sixth follow\u2010up from three sites of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE), a population-based cohort study. Frailty status was determined from physical performance testing and self reported dependency in activities of daily living. Cancer incidence over the four subsequent years was identified through linkage with Medicare claims data. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of cancer incidence with respect to frailty status in multiple models with progressive adjustment for covariates.Of the 3969 participants, 1340 (33.8%) were identified as frail. Cancer incidence at 4\u00a0years was lower in frail participants overall (OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.46\u20130.89) and frail men in particular (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.33\u20130.87). Incidence was lower in women (3.7%) than in men (8.8%), but was not lower in frail women compared with non-frail women (OR 0.77; 95% CI 0.48\u20131.23).Frailty status was associated with decreased cancer incidence, particularly in men, and suggests that mechanisms related to the pathogenesis of frailty may also play a role in inhibiting tumorigenesis. Why this would be more apparent in men than women remains to be clarified.",

Evidence-based practice for the elderly patient is difficult because elderly patients, especially the frail, are often excluded from clinical trials. To facilitate the participation of frail elderly patients in clinical trials, investigators should be more aware of possible barriers when setting up research. While conducting a trial entitled \u2018A randomized controlled trial of geriatric liaison intervention in frail surgical oncology patients\u2019 (LIFE) the main problem was low inclusion rates. This was due to: 1) limited physical and cognitive reserve of frail elderly patients making participation and extra visits to the hospital a burden for patients; 2) difficulty with understanding written information and information given by telephone; and 3) insufficient awareness of the study by health care professionals. To increase inclusion rates, follow-up measurements were taken at a home visit. To overcome barriers to understanding written information and information given over the phone, patients were informed face to face and questionnaires were filled in an interview format. To increase awareness, posters, pencil and sweets with the logo of the study were distributed and the study protocol was repeatedly explained to new staff. Moreover, it was checked if possible eligible patients coming to the hospital were indeed screened for participation. The mentioned measures, increased inclusion rates but also caused an increased time investment and consequently extra financial resources for staff costs.",

The diagnostic performance of the screening tools was evaluated against the CGA with Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis.In total, 170 patients (79 women) with median age 77\u00a0years old (range 66\u201397\u00a0years) were included. Sixty-four percent of patients had an abnormal CGA while according to the GFI (GFI\u00a0\u2265\u00a04) and G8 questionnaire (G8\u00a0\u2264\u00a014) 47% and 76% of patients had an abnormal screening test, respectively.

Surgical and non-surgical BC treatment was analyzed over 5 age groups (<\u00a065, 65 to <\u00a070, 70 to <\u00a075, 75 to <\u00a080 and \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years), and the predictive impact of patient age on specific treatments was calculated using multivariate logistic regression analysis.The proportion of locally advanced, metastatic and incompletely staged BC increased with age. The odds ratio for performing breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in stages I\u2013II BC (0.37), sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) in patients with no palpable adenopathy (0.58), post-BCS radiotherapy (0.04) and adjuvant endocrine treatment (0.23) were all in disfavor of patients \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years of age compared to their younger peers. Only 36% of patients \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years of age with no palpable adenopathy underwent SLND. In the adjusted model, higher age was a significant risk factor for omitting post-BCS radiotherapy, SLND and adjuvant endocrine treatment.This study found an increase in incomplete diagnostic assessment, and a substantial underuse of BCS, post-BCS radiotherapy, SLND and adjuvant endocrine treatment in elderly patients with BC. There is a need for improved management of early BC in the elderly even in a system with universal access to health care services.",

We aimed at modeling PLD-induced hematotoxicity in patients with metastatic breast cancer \u2265\u00a070 years old and at finding predictive factors of neutrophil nadir value.Sixty patients, enrolled in the DOGMES prospective multicentric phase II trial, were treated with PLD at 40\u00a0mg/m2 every 28\u00a0days during six cycles. Trial design included geriatric covariates assessment at inclusion and monitoring of cells count every week for three cycles. A population model was developed to describe hematopoiesis and hematopoietic reserve in these patients. The effect of co-administered G-CSF (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) was also examined.A pharmacodynamic model was built using data from 53 patients not receiving G-CSF. This model assumed an instantaneous effect of PLD on the system. Based on this model, exact neutrophil nadir value was computed and ranged between 0.069\u00a0K/mm3 and 2.63\u00a0K/mm3 confirming the weak hematotoxicity of PLD. The same model was then applied to the 7 patients receiving G-CSF and showed that basal neutrophil count was higher for these patients. No other difference was found between both cohorts. Among the covariates collected, three were predictive of neutrophil nadir value: diabetes, frailty syndrome and assistance at home.This developed model allowed the identification of predictive factors of nadir ANC and the identification of patients that are more likely to develop hematotoxicity that should be monitored with attention.",

Baseline albumin <\u00a03.5\u00a0g/dL and anemia were associated with grade 3\u20135 chemotherapy-associated toxicity. Also, an increase in platelets from cycle 1 to cycle 2 was associated with chemotherapy-associated toxicity. No other statistically significant associations between chemotherapy-associated toxicity and putative biologic and functional risk factors, including age and performance status, were identified.Patients deemed eligible for chemotherapy by their physicians were just as likely to have severe chemotherapy-associated toxicity requiring hospitalization as to finish an initial course of therapy without any serious problems. An increase in platelet count from cycle 1 to cycle 2 was associated with increased toxicity. Additional research, such as exploration of inflammatory cytokines (PDGF, IL6, and IGF-1) to identify the mechanisms of chemotherapy tolerance and prospective evaluation and validation of existing metrics, is needed so that all patients can be appropriately risk stratified.",

     "abstract": "Various antiemetic agents are commonly administered during and after chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting depending on the emetogenic risk. Data specific for patients older than 65 are rarely discussed and it is often assumed that such patients have less risk of nausea and vomiting and might not need the same prevention.To determine whether response to antiemetic regimens incorporating aprepitant varies with patient age, we combined previously unpublished subgroup analyses from four previously published studies.Risk ratios were combined using standard meta-analytic techniques to determine whether antiemetic regimens including aprepitant lead to more complete responses to antiemetic therapy than regimens without aprepitant, among patients aged 65 and over.Patients aged 65 and over have a significantly greater chance of experiencing a complete response (no vomiting or use of rescue therapy) to antiemetic treatment when aprepitant is included in the antiemetic regimen (Risk Ratio 1.25, 95% Confidence Interval 1.11 to 1.40, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) than when it is not. This risk ratio is not significantly different (Q\u00a0=\u00a00.281, p\u00a0=\u00a00.596) from the risk ratio calculated for patients under age 65 (1.30, 95% Confidence Interval 1.19 to 1.42), from the same set of studies.This meta-analysis combines studies utilizing different antiemetic regimens and different patient populations. Only a single efficacy outcome is included, and safety is not assessed.We conclude that for both the under 65\u00a0years and the age 65 and over populations, antiemetic regimens including aprepitant, along with a 5-HT3 antagonist and a corticosteroid, are more effective in reducing chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting than regimens that do not include aprepitant.",

Historical trends were assessed and projections were created for the top 10 cancers by incidence, and also by proportion of cancer deaths for those aged \u2265\u00a085\u00a0years.Currently, the oldest old experiences about 7% of annual new cancer cases and 14% of cancer deaths.

The incidences of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma, bladder, lung, and pancreatic cancers have been increasing, while those of other cancers are stable or decreasing. A substantial proportion of the oldest old (24%) had prior primary cancers. If historical trends continue to 2030, we project that 9% of newly diagnosed cancer cases and 23% of cancer deaths annually will occur in the oldest old.The oldest old may have unique cancer incidence and mortality. To manage a projected major increase in the burden of cancer care, substantial investments in geriatric oncology research, education, and practice are needed.",

We examined factors affecting the delivery of chemotherapy to older patients with breast cancer.Women age \u2265\u00a065 treated with adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute were identified from the RPCI database from 7/1997 to 4/2010. Endpoints were delay, hospitalization, dose reduction, relative dose intensity (RDI) <\u00a085%, and incomplete administration of chemotherapy. Data recorded included medical comorbidities and the use of anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The Pearson chi-squared, Wilcoxon rank sum, logistic regression, Kaplan\u2013Meier, and log-rank tests were used to analyze outcomes. A 0.05 nominal significance level was used in all testing.204 older women received AST. Median follow-up was 50.2\u00a0months. Seventy percent received anthracycline-based AST. In multivariate analysis, older age was a predictor for early termination of chemotherapy and RDI <\u00a085%. Hypertension was correlated with delay and hospitalization. A Charlson comorbidity index \u2265\u00a01 and anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens were associated with chemotherapy delays. The successful completion of chemotherapy and the delivery of a RDI \u2265\u00a085% of planned chemotherapy were associated with improved survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, and p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 respectively). Significant toxicity resulting in a change in therapy or schedule occurred in 45% of cases.Successful administration of planned chemotherapy to older women with breast cancer was associated with improved OS. However, delivery of chemotherapy was associated with increased toxicity and reduced tolerance. Models allowing physicians to better risk-stratify older patients with breast cancer are needed and under development.",

Not only do older adults comprise the majority of cancer patients, at the same time, they have also been vastly underrepresented in clinical trials. As a result, little evidence-based data exist to guide their course of treatment. Alternative trial designs and expanded research evaluations are needed to guide cancer therapy in this population, which is estimated to account for 20% of all Americans by the year 2030. In this review, after examining the status quo, we propose ways to correct the widespread underreporting and underrepresentation of older adults in cancer trials, and highlight existing barriers to trial enrollment. We also outline specific issues of treatment and survivorship as they pertain to older adults, including function, clinical benefit, quality of life, polypharmacy, toxicity, and comorbidity.",

As a result of these demographic facts, more and more older patients with cancer will be taken care of by informal family caregivers. Caregiving is a complex task that may have physical and mental repercussions. Without proper guidance and skills, caregivers may become a burden upon the healthcare and public welfare systems that will have to deal with both older patients with cancer and their caregivers. The current paper presents a brief review of the literature concerning caregivers of older patients with cancer and describes preliminary results comparing family caregivers to a control group in measures of distress and coping. Results indicate that among the research group, there were higher levels of psychological distress and physical problems. The only coping strategy used more frequently by caregivers was acceptance; avoidant coping strategies were found to be highly correlated with distress; and acceptance was negatively correlated to distress only among the men caregivers, where social and instrumental support were negatively correlated to psychological distress among the women in the research group. The results show paths for developing intervention strategies for caregivers of older patients with cancer.",

An intention-to-treat analysis of 100 ovarian cancer patients younger than 65\u00a0years was performed for comparison.Between 1994 and 2008, 100 patients \u2265\u00a065\u00a0years of age had an IP catheter inserted at our institution.

Comorbidity measures have been used to judge RLE in previous studies, but assessments based on other common RLE measures are unknown. We assessed whether screening rates varied based on four clinically relevant RLE measures, including comorbidities, in a nationally-representative, community-based sample.Using the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), we selected men over 65 without prostate cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0709). They were stratified into three RLE categories (0\u20137\u00a0years, 8\u201312\u00a0years, and 13\u00a0+ years) based on validated measures of comorbidities, self-rated health status, functional status, and physical performance. The independent relationship of each RLE measure and a combined measure to screening was determined using multivariable logistic regressions.Self-rated health (OR\u00a0=\u00a06.82; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) most closely correlated with RLE-based screening, while the comorbidity index correlated the least (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.50; p\u00a0=\u00a00.09). The relationship of RLE to PSA screening significantly strengthened when controlling for the number of doctor visits, particularly for comorbidities (OR\u00a0=\u00a043.6; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Men who had consistent estimates of less than 7\u00a0years RLE by all four measures had an adjusted PSA screening rate of 43.3%.Regardless of the RLE measure used, men who were estimated to have limited RLE had significant PSA screening rates. However, different RLE measures have different correlations with PSA screening. Specific estimates of over-screening should therefore carefully consider the RLE measure used.",

Given the co-occurrence of polypharmacy with poor performance status and multi-morbidity, multi-dimensional interventions are needed in the geriatric-oncology population to improve health and cancer outcomes.",

Comorbidities present at the time of diagnosis were collected using the Adult Comorbidity Evaluation-27 index (ACE-27). We examined multiple scoring schemes based on the individual comorbidity ailments, and their severity rating. Harrell's c index and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were used to evaluate the performance of the different comorbidity models.Comorbidity led to an increase in c index from 0.771 for the base model to 0.782 for a model that included indicator variables for every ailment. The prognostic value was however much higher for prostate and breast cancer patients. A simple model which considered linear scores from 0 to 3 per ailment, controlling for cancer type, was optimal according to AIC.The presence of comorbidity impacts on the survival of elderly cancer patients, especially for less lethal cancers, such as prostate and breast cancers. Different ailments have different impacts on survival, necessitating the use of different weights per ailment in a simple summary score of the ACE-27.",

     "abstract": "As the median age of the global population rises, the incidence of cancer is also set to increase, leading to a growing elderly population with cancer. Despite this trend, older patients have traditionally been under-represented in the majority of oncology trials. This is largely due to their heterogeneous nature and extended medical histories that have the potential to hinder treatment. Indeed, it is widely recommended that patients' suitability for a given treatment should not be based on age alone, but rather by an assessment of physiological age on an individual basis. As evidence grows that existing therapies, such as chemotherapy, can be suitable for older patients, the management of these patients has become of increasing importance to oncologists. In particular, the management of haematological toxicities and their effects may be key to achieving optimal clinical outcomes among patients undergoing chemotherapy. Using two of the most common haematological toxicities, anaemia and neutropenia, as examples, we explore current therapies for elderly patients with cancer, and discuss the future management of this growing patient population.",

In elderly patients, where up to 60% will develop CIA, the negative impact of these factors on QoL is even more pronounced. This has been recognised by the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) and the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) who both recommend that CIA in elderly patients should be treated. However, due to the biological age and comorbidities of this patient population, careful consideration of potential therapy, concomitant to chemotherapy, is required. Indeed, as we begin to uncover the specific needs of this population of patients with cancer, it is also important to understand whether currently available treatment modalities are still appropriate. In this article, we explore the current evidence in elderly patients for the use of three of the most common therapies for the treatment of CIA: red blood cell transfusions, iron supplementation, and erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.",

     "abstract": "Age, performance status, and single organ comorbidities have been typically used to assess the suitability of patients for stem cell transplantation (SCT). Until recently, these criteria, combined with poor outcomes, have excluded many older patients from SCT. Improvements in supportive care, reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, and more tolerable graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis have increased the number of older individuals now considered to be viable candidates for SCT. However, this raises concerns about the tolerability of SCT for older persons. Many SCT recipients present with fatigue, weakness, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, and anorexia in the post transplant period, symptoms consistent with a frailty syndrome. These observations, plus the fact that SCT is increasingly offered to older patients, suggest the need to use assessment tools that are appropriate for this population and able to assess frailty. Comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) needs to be tailored specifically to the SCT patient. CGA may prove useful in identifying and risk stratifying those older SCT recipients most likely to become frail following transplantation. Such insight would allow the early use of pharmacologic and rehabilitative interventions that could be targeted to help minimize the toxicity associated with SCT. Frailty caused by SCT may also provide a model of accelerated frailty due to aging, as many similarities may exist in the two syndromes.",

Novel agents, including the immunomodulatory agents thalidomide and lenalidomide, and the proteosome inhibitor bortezomib have dramatically changed the treatment of multiple myeloma in the past decade. The purpose of this review was to examine the recent clinical therapeutic trials in older adults with MM. A number of trials have evaluated the addition of novel agents to the traditional backbone of melphalan and prednisone. The combination of thalidomide with melphalan and prednisone has been evaluated in 7 randomized trials. The combination improves response rates and, in meta-analyses, survival, but at the expense of increased toxicity. Other combination regimens that include lenalidomide or bortezomib likewise are associated with higher response rates, but at the expense of greater toxicity. High dose dexamethasone is excessively toxic in older adults and should be avoided. The roles for high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplant or intermediate-dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplant in older adults with MM in the era of modern therapy remain to be defined. In summary, there are a number of new therapeutic options for older adults with MM, allowing an individualized treatment strategy based on the patient's comorbidities and goals of care.",

Rigorous observational cohort studies can complement randomized controlled trial (RCT) data with information on efficacy, safety, and patient compliance with cancer treatment in a population of \u201creal-world\u201d patients. Well-designed observational cohort studies could be extremely valuable for gathering evidence on the efficacy and safety of cancer treatments, including those that are already available, in older adults in a more cost-effective and timely way than RCTs.

Multivariate analyses with Cox Proportional Hazards and Logistic Regression models included: age; race; comorbidity; insurance status; tumor size; number of nodes positive; hormone receptor status; receipt of radiation; adjuvant chemotherapy; preventive care \u2014 including mammography, Pap smear and primary care visits; and hospitalization.At a mean follow-up of 52.8\u00a0months, overall mortality was significantly lower in those who received RT (HR 0.45, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and higher with older age (HR 1.05, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and greater comorbidity (HR 1.16, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0007). Local recurrence was less with receipt of optimal radiation (HR 0.47; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). Breast cancer event, as determined by a clinically logical algorithm to detect breast cancer recurrence and death, however, was not significantly associated with receipt of RT (OR 1.32, p\u00a0=\u00a00.2).These results imply that the higher short-term mortality in women not receiving RT after BCS is related to factors other than breast cancer recurrence.",

There is often limited knowledge among oncologists/healthcare workers on practical aspects of geriatric assessment. Under the auspices of the educational committee of SIOG, a practice guideline was developed with very concrete information on the most frequently used geriatric assessment tools. This guideline is available at the SIOG website, and is meant to become an 'up-to-date' system where healthcare workers can add new evidence or information if required. This editorial also discusses the reasons why oncologists need a geriatric assessment.",

     "abstract": "Measuring frailty in older adults with cancer may identify patients with an increased risk of treatment complications. As it remains controversial how to identify frailty, the aim of this study was to compare a pre-operative multi-domain frailty measure based on a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) to a modified version of the physical phenotype of frailty (PF) in a cohort of older adults with colorectal cancer, and to analyze the ability of the two classifications to predict post-operative complications and survival.A prospective longitudinal study including 176 patients aged 70\u201394\u00a0years electively operated for colorectal cancer in three Norwegian hospitals. A pre-operative CGA, self-reported quality of life, and measurements of grip strength and gait speed were performed. CGA-frailty was defined as fulfilling one or more of the following criteria: dependency in activities of daily living, severe comorbidity, cognitive dysfunction, depression, malnutrition, or >\u00a0seven daily medications. PF was defined with three or more of the following criteria: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion, low physical activity, impaired grip strength, or slow gait speed. Outcome measures were post-operative complications and survival.The agreement between the classifications was poor. CGA-frailty was identified in 75 (43%) patients, while PF was identified in 22 (13%) patients. Only CGA-frailty predicted post-operative complications [P\u00a0=\u00a00.001]. Both measures predicted survival.A multi-domain frailty measure based on a CGA was more useful than frailty identified from a modified version of the PF criteria in predicting post-operative complications. For overall survival, both frailty measures were predictive.",

To estimate life expectancy, we matched these women to women of similar age, region, and insurance, not diagnosed with breast cancer. We examined 5-year mortality of matched controls by illness burden (measured with the Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]) using Kaplan-Meier statistics. We examined treatments received by estimated life expectancy within CCI levels. We further examined factors associated with receipt of radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery (BCS).Of 9,932 women, 39.6% underwent mastectomy, 30.4% received BCS plus radiotherapy, and 30.0% received BCS alone. Estimated 5-year mortality was 72% for women with CCIs of 3+, yet 38.0% of these women underwent mastectomy and 22.9% received radiotherapy after BCS. Conversely, estimated 5-year mortality was 36% for women with CCIs of 0 and 26.6% received BCS alone. Age 80\u201384, urban residence, higher grade, recent diagnosis, mammography use, and low comorbidity, were factors associated with receiving radiotherapy after BCS. Among women with CCIs of 3\u00a0+ treated with BCS, 36.9% underwent radiotherapy.Many women aged \u2265\u00a080 with limited life expectancies receive radiotherapy after BCS for treatment of early stage breast cancers while many in excellent health do not. More consideration needs to be given to patient life expectancy when considering breast cancer treatments.",

     "abstract": "Multidimensional geriatric assessment (MGA) is essential in individualized treatment decisions in the elderly. The goal of this pilot study was to analyze the impact of age, sex and possibly gender on assessment status in senior cancer patients.An MGA consisting of 12 scores was applied in 111 patients (range 60\u201399, median 75\u00a0years; 51% female). The effect of sex on individual MGA test results was evaluated by analysis of covariance adjusting for the confounding effect of age. The effect of age was investigated by partial correlation analysis adjusting for sex.Women were significantly older than men (men 76.6 vs. 72.2\u00a0years, p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), and advanced age was weakly associated with a reduced assessment status in most MGA dimensions. Age as a confounding factor was apparent in WHO performance status and in the \u201cTimed Up and Go Test\u201d; women's weaker performance status disappeared when adjusted for age. A significant effect of sex was observed in iADL (better functional activities in women), F-SozU (less perceived social support in women), BMI (lower BMI in women) and comorbidities (fewer comorbidities in women). The sex differences in iADL disappeared completely after omitting the gender-specific items in the iADL-5, thus implying a pronounced gender effect. Likewise, the significant difference in self-perceived emotional support (F-SozU 4.3 women vs. 4.6 men, p\u00a0=\u00a00.005) suggests a gender effect in this dimension.Age, sex and gender need to be recognized and integrated as interplaying and confounding factors in the assessment of elderly cancer patients.",

In particular, use of analgesics, acid-suppressing drugs, and antibiotics increased markedly six months preceding cancer diagnosis. Mean daily drug use at diagnosis increased during the study period.Newly diagnosed elderly cancer patients use more drugs than the background population. Drug use increased markedly the last six months prior to the cancer diagnosis.

Such patients have very variable health status, comorbidity levels, and geriatric syndrome prevalence. It is important to identify who would be a candidate for standard treatment schemes, and who would be a candidate for modified therapeutic approaches. Accurate assessment of patient fitness and comorbidities is key when planning therapy for this group as such factors will affect prognosis. In this paper, we review the published literature on a comprehensive geriatric assessment and comorbidity measurements in patients with hematologic malignancies and their correlation with outcomes. Our review identified the Charlson score and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric as the most frequently used comorbidity instruments in the general setting, and the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation-Comorbidity Index in the transplant setting. For the geriatric assessments, the most commonly used scheme combines age, comorbidity, Activities of Daily Living, and the presence of geriatric syndromes. Correlations with overall survival and treatment tolerance are fairly consistently demonstrated. Some tentative thresholds are apparent but remain to be firmly confirmed. Future trials should integrate these assessments as correlates or stratification tools in order to build on the early results already available.",

     "abstract": "There is growing evidence that cancer shares a number of biological pathways with common neurodegenerative diseases of aging. In epidemiologic studies, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease seem to be associated with a decreased cancer risk. Genes associated with neurodegeneration have important functions in protein folding and processing, but often play a role in the cell cycle. Activation and deregulation of the cell cycle is a core feature of both diseases; in the neuron, the end result is apoptosis, while in the malignant cell, it is uncontrolled proliferation. Successful aging requires a careful balance between the forces that promote tissue renewal and those that suppress the cell cycle. Proteins such as p53 and Pin1 might explain why some individuals are relatively protected from cancer but at increased risk of neurodegeneration. This article reviews the available epidemiologic evidence linking neurodegenerative disease and cancer, discusses the cellular pathways and genes which might account for this unexpected relationship, and explores the potential therapeutic implications of this area of research.",

     "abstract": "The p16INK4a tumor suppressor protein functions as a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, preventing phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and consequently arresting the cell cycle in the G1-phase. Together with p53 and p21CIP1 it has an important function in inducing permanent cell cycle arrest, called senescence, in response to all sorts of cellular damage. Bypass of these senescence pathways has been shown to be associated with increased occurrence of multiple malignancies. In this review we focus on the role of p16INK4a in cellular senescence, its tumor suppression potential and its effect on aging. Also, the consequences of senescence in cancer therapy and its possible side-effects are considered. p16INK4a expression in peripheral blood T-lymphocytes is discussed as a promising candidate biomarker which could reflect biological age and could be used to guide individual optimal treatment in the elderly cancer population.",

     "abstract": "Objective: The world population is aging rapidly, thanks to improvements in nutrition, sanitation, disease treatment and prevention (notably for infectious diseases), and better economic conditions. As aging is the main risk factor for cancer, its incidence follows suit. This represents a worldwide challenge and addressing it correctly will require a vast international effort and clear priorities.Methods: The International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG), a multidisciplinary society of experts in the field, decided to identify those priorities. The SIOG National Representatives (NRs) were asked first to identify the 10 highest priorities to address on a worldwide scale. Then, the NRs were asked to identify how these priorities were/could be implemented in their country. A writing committee assembled and edited the results.Results: We identified 3 key areas of priority: education, clinical practice, and research. Education should be targeted at both the professional and the population levels. In clinical practice, pilot models of multidisciplinary collaboration should be expanded first to key reference centers, and a 2-step approach to screening and evaluation should be used to optimize resource use. In research, several strategies can render trials more relevant for older patients. These priorities are fully detailed in a monograph1 that can be viewed online at www.siog.org or ordered from siog@genolier.net. This article explores the rationale and general academic and public health implications of these priorities.Conclusions: These priorities represent an expert consensus with potential to guide education, clinical practice, and research to improve the care of older cancer patients throughout the world.",

Systematic screening has been associated with reductions in cancer-related mortality for a variety of cancers, including breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. Prostate cancer screening remains more controversial despite the recent publication of two large randomized trials of screening. Although guidelines are beginning to address cancer screening specifically among the growing group of seniors age 70 or older, guidance on estimating remaining life expectancy by explicitly considering competing causes of mortality (e.g. comorbid medical illness) and functional status in this age group is limited. In this article, key evidence-based guidelines are reviewed for cancer screening in adults and limitations of screening studies with respect to older adults are discussed. A framework is reviewed for deciding how long to continue cancer screening in older adults, which incorporates age and health status to provide quantitative estimates of remaining life expectancy.",

It is thus paramount to examine the factors that influence the decision-making process in prostate cancer screening in primary care (PC).A systematic review was conducted, searching eight databases for articles published \u2013 in English, German, French or Dutch \u2013 or in press between January 2000 and February 2011 on studies on the self-reported practices and attitudes of primary care physicians (PCPs) with regard to the use of PSA tests as well as older patients' points of view regarding PSA testing. Study selections, data extraction and assessment of the quality of the studies were conducted independently by two reviewers. A taxonomy of factors influencing the decision-making process was developed to support data extraction.The analysis involved 20 studies conducted in North America and Europe. Screening with PSA represents a routine practice in PC, even for the most elderly patients. The primary drivers of the decision-making process, as acknowledged by both PCPs and patients, are interactions between patients and PCPs and patient characteristics (e.g. high risk, older age). Other factors are related to the PCP (characteristics, working environment, perceived responsibility, knowledge, perception of PSA test) and the patient (awareness).Even if guidelines are precautious about screening for prostate cancer, using a PSA test in PC is routine practice in a variety of countries. This review has identified factors influencing prostate cancer screening for older adults. The results suggest that multi-component system changes at the physician and patient levels are needed in order to optimize prostate cancer screening practices in PC, particularly for older men who will not benefit from it.",

     "abstract": "The progressive aging of populations coupled with the increasing prevalence of cancer in elderly people, due to their long exposure to potential oncogenic factors, represents a formidable challenge for the health system. Moreover, whereas in many adult cancer patients, malignancy represents the primary basic target to be treated, in the elderly patients a concurrent status of sarcopenia multiplies the risk of aggressive therapies and forces the clinician to maintain a holistic view of his patient.A common problem for the elderly cancer patient is the progressive malnutrition which is due to coexistence and/or potentiation of the metabolic alterations related to sarcopenia with underlying cancer cachexia. Both processes lead to loss of body weight, lean body mass, and muscle function, as well as a progressive deterioration of function of many organ/systems, a poor quality of life and finally to a poor adaptation to any stress event.Although neither sarcopenia nor cancer cachexia may be reduced to a condition of simple starvation, an adequate nutritional intake is the conditio sine qua non which can make possible any attempt of aggressive oncologic therapies which are validated in adult subjects.This paper, after a short review of topics including the interaction between sarcopenia and cancer cachexia, the nutritional status as a component of geriatric assessment tools, the prevalence of malnutrition and the negative prognostic role of malnutrition, focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of the nutritional support of the elderly cancer patient.",

The role of chemotherapy for metastatic pancreatic cancer in very elderly patients (\u2265\u00a080\u00a0years) has not been well studied.We reviewed all cases of metastatic pancreatic cancer in patients aged \u2265\u00a080\u00a0years in the Veterans Affairs Central Cancer Registry (VACCR) from 1995 to 2007. Four hundred and forty patients were identified. Type of therapy received, tumor grade, tobacco history, sex and race were noted. Overall survival was calculated by log rank and Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. Baseline co-morbid conditions were scored using the Charlson co-morbidity index score (CCIS), a validated measure of patient co-morbidity.Among the 440 eligible patients in the analysis, the majority received no therapy (83%), while only 12% received chemotherapy alone. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that chemotherapy was associated with significant superior median overall survival (4.9\u00a0months, 95% CI 3.57\u20135.77) compared to no therapy (1.7\u00a0months, 95% CI 0.9\u20131.3) (HR\u00a0=\u00a00.41, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

Based on our taxonomy, barriers and facilitators to cancer screening were classified in terms of the physician, the patient and the health care system. The main barriers were the PCP's lack of belief in the usefulness of cancer screening for older adults, the patients' embarrassment, discomfort or fear of the test and the lack of health care coverage for screening tests. This review suggests that interventions targeting the physician, the patient and the health care system are required to optimize breast and colorectal cancer screening in primary care.",

Our goal is to identify critical issues that must be weighed when selecting treatment for elderly gynecologic oncology patients. As individuals continue to achieve longer lifespans, and the population of elderly women continues to grow, gynecologic oncologists will face new challenges regarding treatment. Due to minimal inclusion in randomized controlled trials and the influence of selection bias in many of the current studies, little evidence-based data is available regarding the most effective treatment options for this population. It is therefore unclear whether treatment should differ from that offered to younger populations, and if so under what circumstances. As of yet, there are no validated measures by which to determine tolerability and success of aggressive therapies for this population. Ultimately, each patient must be evaluated individually with regards to risk factors and prognosis, and therapy should not be withheld from elderly individuals solely on the basis of age alone.",

According to the reference test, 14 patients (11%) were \u201cfit\u201d, 99 (79%) were \u201cvulnerable\u201d and 13 (10%) were \u201cfrail\u201d. The OGS had a sensitivity of 88% (CI 95%: 80% to 93%) and a specificity of 44% (CI 95%: 28% to 63%).The OGS is a short decision-making algorithm in French with high sensitivity that can easily help to identify vulnerable patients for whom a CGA could potentially optimize their cancer treatment. This tool is easy to implement and could be used by oncologists at the time of the first consultation.",

The most common reason for referral was depressive symptoms (54.4%), followed by difficulty coping (18%), and anxiety (15.1%). Main psychiatric diagnoses were as follows: 20.1% mood disorder due to general medical condition (GMC), 11.7% major depressive disorder, and 8.4% anxiety disorders. 6.7% of patients were diagnosed with a cognitive disorder after the first consultation. Only 40% of patients with a depressive disorder diagnosis had a prior history of depression. 56% of patients had no known past psychiatric history prior to cancer diagnosis.Psychiatric disorders in elderly cancer patients are varied, and require recognition and ongoing management by health care professionals.",

     "abstract": "Phase I clinical trials play a crucial role in development of therapeutics for cancer patients. During phase I clinical trials, common toxicities are delineated, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) are determined and a dose for phase II studies is recommended. However, reviews of the phase I population indicate a younger group of participants with a median age of 50\u201355 years. No data exists on the performance of octogenarians on phase I trials. Concerns for enrollment of this patient population relate to the presence of co-morbidities and possibly altered pharmacokinetics in the setting of unknown potential toxicities.We present herein the largest review of octogenarians on phase I trials. Twenty-two octogenarian patients with a median age of 83 were enrolled on phase I clinical trials.More than 50% of them were chemotherapy na\u00efve, most likely indicative of the fact that treating physicians believed standard therapy to be potentially toxic to this population. These 22 patients were otherwise matched in terms of performance status and other parameters to a control group of participants (<\u00a080 years). This includes a similar number of cycles administered. Patients (\u2265\u00a080 years) had a 3-fold higher rate of achieving DLT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.06) compared to the control group enrolled at the same dose level. The toxicities observed include cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and infectious complications. Three patients were enrolled on molecular targeted treatments with no significant toxicities.We conclude that enrollment of patients of ages\u00a0\u2265\u00a080 years on phase I trials of chemotherapy agents is most likely associated with higher risk of DLT.",

Most felt the current system of self referral was under-utilized due to poor user awareness. Predicted life expectancy, co-morbidity and patient preference were viewed as important factors influencing screening recommendation. Chronological age was thought less important. The present system was thought flawed, but there was little enthusiasm for extending screening due to perceived risks and reduced cost efficacy. Some form of selectivity for fitter women was advocated.There was acceptance that fitter older women may benefit from screening whilst the less fit may be harmed suggesting that some form of selective invitation would be preferable to the present system but would be practically difficult and costly to administer. The present system of self referral was felt to be inadequate due to low levels of awareness and uptake.",

Trial registration number: NCT00039351.DLBCL patients aged \u2265\u00a070\u00a0years with poor physiological functioning received cyclophosphamide (750\u00a0mg/m2 IV at d1), vincristine (1.4\u00a0mg/m2 IV at d1, maximum of 2\u00a0mg) and prednisone (40\u00a0mg/m2 d1 to d5) for six cycles.

Low response rates were observed with only 18.5% complete response and 25.9% partial response leading to the early termination of the trial. Despite strict dose reduction rules, high toxicity rates were observed with four severe toxicities and eight early deaths. CGA data showed that over 90% of patients were depressed, over 80% dependent for instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and almost half of our patients had severe comorbidities showing that we clearly selected a population of \u201cfrail\u201d elderly.This adapted COP regimen for vulnerable patients produced an 18.5% complete response rate.

We sought to explore information needs, control preferences, decisional regret, and decisional satisfaction in adult patients with AML and to explore differences by age group.We recruited 35 consecutive English-speaking patients with recently diagnosed AML, evenly split between older ( age 60+, n\u00a0=\u00a017) and younger (n\u00a0=\u00a018) adults. We administered questionnaires including the satisfaction with decision making scale, decisional regret scale, control preferences scale, and quality of life questions at one or two key time points: start of chemotherapy, end of induction chemotherapy, and end of intensive chemotherapy.52% of patients preferred a passive decision-making role. Most patients (80%) achieved their preferred decision-making role. Overall decisional satisfaction scores were high and regret scores were low, but there was a trend toward less satisfaction with more passive decision-making roles (p\u00a0=\u00a00.066). Most patients had a high level of trust in their physician. Physicians and nurses were reported as the most useful sources of information. There were no significant differences in any of these outcomes by age group. Quality of life and fatigue were also similar among older and younger patients.These findings demonstrate similarities in information and decisional issues in older and younger adults with AML and highlight the need for further study of decisional regret and satisfaction over time in this patient population.",

     "abstract": "We investigated the caregiver's role in the choice of non-disclosure in patient\u2013physician communication.A total of 194 family caregivers of partially informed (PI) or not-informed (NI) elderly cancer patients participated in the study protocol. PI patients received only approximate information aimed at reassurance; NI patients had no access to any information regarding their health status. The family caregiver, identified by the patient, underwent an interview regarding patient\u2013physician communication.As many as 35.2% (n\u00a0=\u00a074) were caregivers for NI and 64.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a0136) for PI. Patients living with their spouse were better informed than patients living with their children (80.0% vs. 58.7%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). The decision to not inform the patients mainly arose in the family (86.1% vs. 77.0% of NI and PI, respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.12) and was due to the psychological frailty of the patient (52.8% NI vs. 32.8% PI, p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) and to the fear of severe emotional distress during a fully disclosing patient\u2013physician communication (67.0%). Caregivers for PI patients were more concerned sharing information on the prognosis (48.4%), while caregivers for NI patients were more concerned sharing information on diagnosis (44.4%).The choice of non-disclosure was independent from an explicit request of the patient and was associated with the caregiver's fears and needs. Because elderly patients rely on a family caregiver to cope with their disease, early intervention tailored to caregiver's needs and skills are necessary. Such interventions will avoid the risk of caregiver distress and help medical staff in managing the various aspects of clinical communication with the elderly cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "The aging population brings with it increased cancer related morbidity and mortality. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) identifies areas of concern for the older patient with cancer that may not be detected with traditional oncological methods of assessment. However CGA is resource intensive and thus screening tools have been developed. Having developed a screening tool, we present the characteristics of the first 200 patients seen by our geriatric oncology clinic.All patients aged 70 and over were invited to complete a self-reported screening questionnaire at time of referral to oncology services, covering domains addressed by the CGA. These questionnaires were then reviewed at a weekly multidisciplinary meeting. From this, five key measures, supplemented by medical chart review and clinical impression, were used to classify patients into fit, vulnerable or frail categories.For the first 200 patients, the average age was 76.7\u00a0years, and 54% were male. The majority were community living, and 72% were being treated palliatively. Twenty-eight percent were classified fit, 60% vulnerable, and 13% frail. The fit, vulnerable and frail groups differed significantly in comorbidities, polypharmacy, memory concerns, falls, weight loss, physical function and exhaustion.Elderly patients referred to an Australian geriatric oncology program are a heterogenous group. The use of a screening tool for geriatric assessment was a feasible and acceptable method for assessing older patients with cancer. Further work is required to examine the prognostic value of classifying patients into fit, vulnerable and frail.",

Large population-based studies all found an association between comorbidity and survival among elderly cancer patients. However, we need to focus on cancer-specific survival to conclude on the influence of comorbidity on cancer disease and its treatment. Prospective studies are needed to conclude on the influence of comorbidity and polypharmacy on treatment tolerance and response to antineoplastic treatment.",

As the proportion of older individuals in the United States increases, with 20% being over 65 by 2030, it will become increasingly important for hematology\u2013oncology trainees to have directed curriculum in geriatric-oncology.In order to better define the best way to meet the need for educational material specific to the special population of older patients for Oncology Training Programs, a survey was developed and administered to Hematology\u2013Oncology Program Directors, in order to perform an educational needs assessment. The survey was administered during the 2008 Annual Meeting to 54 attendees at the Program Director's Breakfast. The survey asked questions regarding general program characteristics, as well as the importance of geriatric-oncology curriculum, a description of such current curriculum, the most important topics to cover in the curriculum, and recommendations for the format of the curriculum.The survey showed that 32% of training programs had a formal curriculum that covered topics in geriatric-oncology, 56% had an informal curriculum, and 2% had no curriculum. Most used a multimodality approach including clinical experience, journal clubs and lectures. Most hematology\u2013oncology fellowship directors believe curriculum in geriatric-oncology is important; have faculty with either training or interest in geriatric-oncology that could facilitate curriculum delivery; and would use a curriculum if it were readily available.Investment in developing content and curriculum in geriatric-oncology would be very valuable and well-received.",

Although this is usually viewed in the context of the cell biology, we argue here that age-associated changes to immunity may also contribute to the age-associated increasing incidence of most cancers. This is because cancers are immunogenic (at least initially), and the immune system can and does protect against tumorigenesis. However, immune competence tends to decrease with age, a phenomenon loosely termed \u201cimmunosenescence,\u201d implying that decreased immunosurveillance against cancer could also contribute to increased disease in the elderly. This review weighs some of the evidence for and against this possibility.",

However, it may increase the risk of falls due to decreases in testosterone, lean body mass and strength. Falls are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in older adults. However, the impact of ADT on falls remains unclear.Three groups matched on age and education were recruited: PC patients starting continuous ADT (ADT users) (n\u00a0=\u00a088), PC patients not receiving ADT (PC controls) (n\u00a0=\u00a086), and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a086). Patients retrospectively reported any falls in the 12\u00a0months prior to study entry and prospectively at 3 time points over the next 12\u00a0months (after starting ADT). Physical performance measures were done at each time point. The risks of having a fall at both baseline and over 1\u00a0year of follow-up were analyzed using logistic regression.At baseline 13.8% (n\u00a0=\u00a036) of patients (ADT users\u00a0=\u00a014.7%, PC controls\u00a0=\u00a08.1%, healthy controls\u00a0=\u00a018.6%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.132) reported falls in the prior year.

These include: (1) developing therapeutic studies for older adults who are not eligible for standard clinical trials (because of comorbidity or functional status), or for patients who are deemed to be at high risk for toxicity from standard therapy (frail or vulnerable); (2) identifying the age group of older adults who are underrepresented on clinical trials and developing trials specifically for these patients; (3) designing trials to include a certain proportion of older adults for subset analyses; and (4) including a geriatric assessment in therapeutic clinical trials in order to identify factors other than chronologic age that identify those older adults who are \u201cvulnerable\u201d (at risk for toxicity) and \u201cfit\u201d (able to tolerate cancer therapy without significant toxicity).To address knowledge gaps in geriatric oncology, national and international cooperative group leaders discussed strategies in clinical trial design to improve the evidence-based research and accrual of older adults.
