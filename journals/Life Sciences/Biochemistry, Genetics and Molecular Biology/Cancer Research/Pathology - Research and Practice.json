     "abstract": "Thyroid cancer (TC) is known as the most prevalent form of endocrine malignancy. With regard to high heterogeneity of the nodules, problem of discriminating between benign and malignant ones in terms of pathological characteristics, as well as lack of appropriate molecular markers; significant efforts are being made to identify molecular markers that able to detect tumorous lesions. Survivin, the newest member of the family of proteins inhibiting cell apoptosis, has been recently considered as a novel molecule marker for cancer. Studies on TC have also demonstrated distinctive expression of survivin and its splice variants in cancer cells compared to normal ones. Therefore, detection of survivin expression and its new splice variants can be utilized to identify tumor nodules and distinguish them from non-cancerous ones, along with other routine laboratory methods.",

     "abstract": "Nearly sixty percent of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) undergo radiation therapy (RT). During the course of treatment patients may experience normal tissue reactions. It is a well established fact that genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, such as microRNA (miRNA) level changes might be associated with radiotoxicity, as a response to irradiation.This is the first study that has investigated levels of radiosensory miRNAs in association with acute genitourinary radiotoxicity extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBCs), in three points; before RT (BRT), after RT (ART) and on the first control examination (FCONT). We measured levels of miR-21/146a/155 expression by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), comparative \u0394\u0394Ct method, in fifteen patients with localized prostate cancer, treated with three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT). Nine subjects have experienced acute genitourinary (GU) radiotoxicity whereas six where without GU radiotoxicity.Firstly, we detected the highest levels of miR-21 in ART group (p\u2009=\u20090.043) in the patients with acute GU radiotoxicity. Secondly, we found trend towards higher miR-21 levels and significantly higher levels of miR-146a/155 within the patients with acute GU toxicity than in patients without (p\u2009=\u20090.068, p\u2009=\u20090.016, and p\u2009=\u20090.010, respectively).

     "abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that Trichosanthin (TCS) exerts anti-virus, immunoregulation and a broad spectrum anti-tumor pharmacological activities. Trichosanthin is a promising agent for the treatment of cervical cancer. However, the exact effects and potential mechanism of TCS on cervical cancer are not well known.The cell viability of TCS on cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and caski cells) were detected by a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cell proliferation was measured by Ki-67 staining and cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. Cell migration and invasion were detected by wound assay and transwell assay, respectively. The levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, Bcl-2, Caspase-3, p-STAT5, STAT5, p-C-myc, C-myc were detected by western blot.The present study showed that TCS inhibited the proliferation of HeLa and caski cells and reduced Ki-67 and P-C-myc expression. In addition, flow cytometric analysis showed that TCS induced the apoptosis of HeLa and caski cells. The potent effect of TCS on cell apoptosis as determined by the increase the levels of caspase-3 and decrease the levels of Bcl-2. TCS also inhibited cervical cancer cell invasion, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Furthermore, TCS treatment markedly inhibited the activation of STAT5/C-myc signaling pathway.In conclusion, the present study suggest that TCS inhibits the proliferation, migration and EMT of human cervical cancer cells, which maybe mediated by inhibiting the activation of STAT5/C-myc signaling pathway.",

The aim of the present study was to quantify the numbers of macrophages polarized as M1 or M2 phenotypes and the expression of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in tissue sections from patients with benign ovarian endometrioma (OE) and its malignant transformation (endometriosis-associated ovarian cancer, EAOC). We performed a retrospective study at the Department of Gynecology, Nara Medical University hospital from December 2012 to March 2015. This study included 53 patients with OE (n\u2009=\u200933) and EAOC (n\u2009=\u200920), and we evaluated polarized functional status of macrophages by immunohistochemical staining of CD68, CD11c, CD163 and HO-1. The number of the M1 phenotype (CD11c+, p\u2009=\u20090.001) and the M2 phenotype (CD163+, p\u2009=\u20090.009) was significantly lower in EAOC patients than in OE patients. Analyzing the correlations between the studied markers, the expression of CD68, CD11c, and CD163 proteins significantly correlated with each other (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The number of M2 phenotypes expressing HO-1 was significantly decreased in the EAOC group, compared with the OE group (P\u2009<\u20090.001), demonstrating sustained downregulation of an antioxidant marker, HO-1, in EAOC. In conclusion, reduced number of M2 macrophages expressing HO-1 may have an important role in promoting malignant transformation of OE.",

Bioinformatics, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, correlation analysis, RNA interference, gene over-expression and luciferase assays were performed to clarify the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulation between HIF1A and VEGF.Both HIF1A and VEGF levels were elevated in the peritoneal effluent of peritoneal dialysis patients with ultrafiltration problems, and were positively correlated with each other at protein level and mRNA level. Bioinformatics analysis identified 8 common targeted miRNAs for HIF1A and VEGF, including miR-17-5p, 20a, 20b, 93, 106a, 106b, 199a-5p and 203.

It has been reported, that miR-23a-3p promotes the development of tumors for prostate cancer, gastric cancer and gliomas. The functions of miR-23a-3p in OSCC however, remain unclear. In this study, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is revealed as a direct target of miR-23a-3p, based on luciferase assays and immunoblotting. The expression of miR-23a-3p and FGF2 were found to be significantly downregulated and upregulated in OSCC tissues respectively. This indicates a reverse correlation between miR-23a-3p and FGF2 levels. Using in vitro approaches we ascertained that miR-23a-3p might contribute to the inhibition of growth and inhibition through increasing apoptosis in OSCC cells; while an inhibitor of miR-23a-3p could reverse this effect. Examination of a clinical cohort of OSCC patients suggested that reduced expression of miR-23a-3p is correlated with more advanced cancerous stage and poorer differentiation of OSCC cell. Additionally, a survival analysis and the Cox-hazard regression model showed that higher levels of miR-23a-3p can be used reliably for prognosis of OSCC patients. This study indicates that miR-23a-3p might suppress tumor proliferation, invasion and promote apoptosis of OSCC by targeting FGF2. miR-23a-3p has the potential to be used as prognostic indicator, and could be exploited as a therapeutic reagent for OSCC in the future.",

In this study, we discovered that the relative expression of SNHG14 was significantly upregulated in CC tissues and cells, and associated with the overall survival of CC patients. Moreover, knockdown of SNHG14 significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted cell apoptosis in CC. Molecular mechanism explorations revealed that SNHG14 acted as a sponge of miR-206 and that YWHAZ was a downstream target gene of miR-206 in CC. Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis uncovered a significantly negative correlation between SNHG14 (or YWHAZ) and miR-206 expression, while a significantly positive correlation between SNHG14 and YWHAZ expression in CC tissues.

Nevertheless, other types of non-conventional but suspicious mucosal changes serrated change/dysplasia, NOS and villous hypermucinous change, have also been reported in IBD patients. Preneoplastic potential of these lesions is still not well elucidated.The aim of this study was identification of IBD-associated CRCs focusing on finding related precursor lesions in the surgical specimen or in archival biopsy samples followed by a detailed morphological, immunohistochemical and molecular evaluation.

Detailed morphological evaluation, immunohistochemical analysis of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, p53 and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression and molecular analysis for KRAS, NRAS and BRAF gene mutation were performed in the retrieved CRC cases as well as in the detected dysplasia and PPLs of these patients.We identified 11 cases of morphologically heterogenous IBD-associated CRCs, occurring in 5 males and 6 females, aged 26\u201379 years (mean 44 years). A total of 22 mucosal lesions were revealed in 8 CRC patients comprising conventional IBD-associated dysplasia (4 lesions), PPLs as serrated change/dysplasia NOS (11 lesions), villous hypermucinous change (5 lesions), and two true serrated lesions (one sessile serrated adenoma and one traditional serrated adenoma). More than one type of lesion was found in 6 patients. Seven CRC cases harbored mutation of KRAS/NRAS and one case of BRAF. Two patients with KRAS-mutated CRC showed the same mutation in PPL in the same specimen (one serrated change NOS and one TSA with high-grade dysplasia). Similarly, one BRAF-mutated carcinoma case presented the same mutation in serrated change/dysplasia, NOS in the same specimen. Of the CRCs, two showed deficient MMR system profile, six presented with loss of MGMT expression, and six showed aberrant p53 expression. PPLs showed deficient MGMT expression (14 cases) and aberrant p53 (10 cases) as well.IBD-associated CRCs are very heterogeneous entities. Besides conventional IBD-related dysplasia, other types of mucosal lesions may be associated with long lasting IBD and CRC e.g. villous hypermucinous change and serrated change/dysplasia, NOS. Since these lesions share certain genetic or immunohistochemical changes with the related CRC, a suspicion is raised that these lesions may also have preneoplastic potential. Awareness of these changes is necessary to prevent their missing and under-reporting, and further studies of these lesions should be carried out.",

     "abstract": "Cervical carcinoma is one of the most universal cancers among women. Recent researches have reported that microRNA-150-5p (miR-150-5p) is up-regulated in diverse carcinomas containing cervical carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the potential role of miR-150-5p in the progress of cervical carcinoma cells including proliferation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).The ability of miR-150-5p to promote carcinogenesis was analyzed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blot assays, respectively. Bioinformatics analyses predicted and identified whether SRC kinase signaling inhibitor 1 (SRCIN1) was served as a potential target of miR-150-5p. C-33A and HeLa cells were utilized to determine the function of miR-150-5p through targeting SRCIN1. Among the aberrantly expressed miRNAs, miR-150-5p was significantly revealed differential expression in cervical carcinoma cell lines and was closely relevant to cell growth regulation. Furthermore, we found that SRCIN1 overexpression could obviously inhibit the proliferation and EMT of cervical cancer cells triggered by miR-150-5p mimics as well as accelerated the apoptosis of cervical carcinoma cells. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that miR-150-5p could promote the proliferation and EMT of cervical carcinoma cells via targeting SRCIN1. Thus, miR-150-5p may hold a promise as a prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target for cervical carcinoma.",

Recent studies have similarly documented the presence of the luteinizing hormone (LH)/hCG receptor (LHCGR) in a variety of nongonadal organs; however, its clinicopathological significance in ovarian cancer remains unclear. The present study used a combination of immunohistochemical, real-time PCR, and western blot analyses to examine hCG and LHCGR expression in normal and cancerous tissues collected from patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). hCG and LHCGR expression levels were resultantly shown to be significantly increased and decreased in cancerous versus normal (or benign) ovarian tissues, respectively (P\u202f<\u202f0.05), and both expression pattern changes were associated with more advanced tumor stages and a higher rate of metastasis. Furthermore, patients with tumors with high or low levels of hCG and LHCGR, respectively, experienced a worse overall survival (OS) rate than those with low hCG or high LHCGR expression levels (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). In fact, hCG and LHCGR expression levels were independent prognostic factors of patient OS (P\u202f<\u202f0.05) for EOC. Collectively, these findings indicate that hCG and LHCGR expression pattern changes are associated with EOC occurrence and progression. Thus, hCG and LHCGR represent promising potential targets to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of patients with EOC.",

Cisplatin (DDP) has been a widely used drug for the treatment of cancer, also usually applied in gastric cancer in clinic. However, the side effects including toxicity and drug-resistance restricted the usage of DDP in clinic, so we prepared a DDP-complexed hydrogel (DDP-Gel) and investigated its efficacy in gastric cancer. For in vivo studies, MKN45-Luc cells were injected into BLAB/C node mice subcutaneously to establish gastric cancer with orthotopically grown tumors. Mice bearing tumors were treated with normal saline, DDP and DDP-Gel. Body weight and survival condition were observed and recorded. The treatment efficacy in vivo was detected by luciferase imaging and histological evaluation was performed by H&E staining of different organs. Additionally, normal ICR mice were treated with different doses of DDP/DDP-Gel to calculate their LD50 in vivo. The results showed that DDP-Gel prolonged survival time and ameliorated body weight changes of mice bearing tumors. DDP-Gel exhibited higher efficacy to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis, compared to DDP. Besides, LD50 of DDP-Gel was 166.0\u2009mg/kg, 13.2 folds higher than DDP. As a conclusion, DDP-Gel showed a more effective and safer function than DDP in gastric cancer, which indicating that DDP-Gel might be a novel strategy for gastric cancer therapy.",

Anti-tumor chemotherapeutic agents often exert secondary effect on hematopoietic system leading to aplastic anemia by marrow failure. The precise mechanisms behind the marrow ablative effects of the drugs remain yet to be established. The present study holds a mechanistic approach to unveil the mystery. Aplastic anemia was generated in mice with the administration of busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by the characterization of the disease with peripheral blood hemogram, histopathological and cytochemical examinations of bone marrow. To gain deep knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the hematopoietic disruption, cytotoxicity assay, DNA damage measurement, apoptosis study, replicative senescence analysis, redox balance study, mitochondrial membrane potential change assessment, flowcytometric expressional analysis of p21, p53, ATM, Chk-2, Necdin, Gfi-1, c-myc, KU-80 and Sod-2 were done with marrow hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells (HSPCs). Severe blood pancytopenia and marrow hypocellularity was found in aplastic mice. Proliferative hindrance and apoptosis of marrow cells were identified as the cause behind the hematopoietic catastrophe. The genotoxic effects of the drugs triggered chromatin damage and induced replicative senescence in aplastic HSPCs by upregulating p21 in a p53 independent manner. Moreover, accumulation of genomic insults also caused apoptotic elimination of marrow cells due to disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential by generating redox imbalance. The study established the underlying mechanisms behind hematopoietic disruption during drug induced marrow aplasia. Outcome of the study may be helpful in successful designing of therapeutic strategies for the disease concerned.",

     "abstract": "Src homology region 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is ubiquitously expressed in cytoplasmic localization, which in turn confers tumor malignancy and poor prognosis in various human cancers. YAP1 interacts with SHP2 to promote translocation of SHP2 to nucleus, which consequently promotes Wnt target activation. However, the oncogenic role of the nuclear localization of SHP2 in human cancers remains unclear. We hypothesized that nuclear SHP2 localization, in combination with nuclear YAP1 expression, could be associated with poor overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) due to an increase in cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA expression following activation of Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis of SHP2 and YAP1 protein expression in 102 tumors resected from patients with NSCLC revealed that nuclear SHP2 expression was well correlated with nuclear YAP1 expression (P\u2009<\u20090.001). Evaluation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA levels by the real-time reverse-phase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that patients with high cyclin D1 and high c-Myc mRNA expressing tumors more commonly showed high nuclear YAP1 and high nuclear SHP2 (high/high) rather than the high/low, low/high, or low/low combinations (P\u2009<\u20090.001 for cyclin D1 and c-Myc). Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression models showed OS and RFS to be poorer in patients in the high/high subgroup than in the low/low subgroup (OS: HR\u2009=\u20092.85, 95% CI, 1.52\u20135.35, P\u2009=\u20090.001; RFS: HR\u2009=\u20092.55, 95% CI, 1.37\u20134.72, P\u2009=\u20090.003). No prognostic significance was observed for the other two subgroups (low/high and high/low) when compared to the low/low subgroup in this study population. Therefore, we suggest that the prognostic value of SHP2 could reflect the nuclear localization of SHP2 and its interaction with nuclear YAP1, which led to subsequent upregulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA expression via activation of the Wnt/\u00df-catenin signaling pathway.",

To our knowledge, we report the 8th subcutaneous case of a pregnancy-related decidualization occurring in a post-caesarean section scar endometriosis. A 33-year-old woman showed a painless, firm, subcutaneous nodule (size: 1\u2009cm) located near the scar of a caesarean section performed 3 years before. Ultrasound examination revealed a well-delimited, hypoechogenic nodule showing perilesional inflammatory reaction without vascular signals. The nodule was considered a post-surgical granuloma: its size did not increase during 4 years of follow-up. Finally, the nodule was totally excised during a second caesarean section performed at 39 weeks of gestation. Histological examination showed nodules of decidualized stromal cells surrounding rare, small, atrophic endometrial glands. Nuclear atypia and mitoses were absent.

The same applies to the image that Hamperl draws of those pathologists who were part of his professional and personal network.The study is partly based on previously unevaluated archive sources and on a reanalysis of the relevant research literature.The paper concludes that Hamperl practised pronounced \"self-fashioning\": His memoirs give the impression of being formally and linguistically smoothened out and are clearly misleading in terms of content. They are characterised by omissions, ornamentation, and embellishments. Thus Hamperl makes false statements on the question of his NSDAP membership and depicts himself as a politically uninvolved university teacher. Furthermore, even in retrospect, he makes hardly any critical remarks on Nazi ideology and Nazi crimes.",

We found LGA placentas are associated with significantly higher neonatal weight but lower fetal-to-placental weight ratio (f/p) for both T1DM and T2DM. T2DM LGA placentas possessed a significantly higher prevalence of placental insufficiency (f/p<10th percentile). Compared to LGA groups, more chronic villitis were seen in the AGA T2DM group, and more acute chorioamnionitis in the T1DM AGA group. No significant differences were seen in maternal BMI or glycemic control. In pregnancies complicated with preGDM, LGA placentas had generally lower placental efficiency than AGA placentas.",

In this report, extranodal histopathological changes of iMCD with/without TAFRO were analyzed. Regarding the kidney pathology, we observed the proliferation of mesangial cells with positive staining of interleukin-6 (IL-6), consistent with membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, in two cases of iMCD with TAFRO. The number of megakaryocytes per high-powered fields was not significantly different between iMCD cases with and without TAFRO. In conclusion, extranodal lesions of iMCD with/without TAFRO showed various interesting histopathological findings. These lesions may therefore be related to the clinical condition of TAFRO. Obtaining further knowledge about TAFRO will require the observation of nodal as well as extranodal lesions.",

     "abstract": "Malignant tumors of the digestive tract include esophageal, gastric, and colorectal carcinomas, which all have high global mortality rates. A clinical role for small nuclear RNA (snRNA), a type of small non-coding RNA, has not yet been documented for digestive tract pan-adenocarcinomas. Therefore, the aim of the study was to identify differentially expressed snRNAs and to explore their prognostic implications in pan-adenocarcinomas from the esophagus, stomach, colon, and rectum. The pan-carcinoma RNA-sequencing data of four types of digestive tract cancers with 1, 102 cases obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project were analyzed and the differentially expressed snRNAs were evaluated using the edgeR package. The prognostic value of each of the selected snRNAs was determined by univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. All the digestive tract pan-adenocarcinomas showed differential expression of three snRNAs: the up-regulated RNU1-106\u2009P and RNU6-850\u2009P and the down-regulated RNU6-529\u2009P. Interestingly, RNU6-101\u2009P appeared to be a risk factor for esophageal adenocarcinoma (ESAD) and RNVU1-4 was potentially a protective factor for stomach adenocarcinoma (STAD) survival. This consistent finding of differential expression of all three snRNAs in all four types of digestive system cancers suggests potential roles for these snRNAs in the tumorigenesis of digestive system cancers. RNU6-101\u2009P could play a pivotal role in the progression of ESAD and RNVU1-4 could perform a protective role in STAD. However, since the current findings were based on RNA-sequencing data mining, more studies are needed for verification.",

In lung cancers, MET activation up-regulates PD-L1 expression. In this study, we investigated expression of MET and PD-L1 in MSI-H gastric carcinoma and the effects on prognosis.MET and PD-L1 (SP142) immunohistochemistry was performed in 73 gastric carcinomas with MSI-H. In cases with MET overexpression, we performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). PD-L1 expression was calculated from both tumor cells (2+ and 3+ in > 10% of tumor cells was defined as PD-L1TC+) and immune cells (positive in >5% immune cells was PD-L1IC+), and also used a combined positive score (CPS; number of PD-L1 staining cells relative to all viable tumor cells; > 1 was PD-L1+).In 73 MSI-H gastric carcinomas, MET overexpression was observed in 11 cases (15.1%). In all 11 cases with MET overexpression,MET amplification was not found. MET overexpression was not related to any of clinico-pathological variables and PD-L1 expression. However, the PD-L1 CPS tended to be higher in tumors that were MET positive. Although MET overexpression alone was not a prognostic indicator, combined MET overexpression/PD-L1 predictive models showed that patients with MET+/PD-L1+ showed the best prognosis for overall survival as compared to other groups.MET overexpression was observed in 15% of MSI-H gastric carcinomas and was associated with high level expression of PD-L1.",

The results indicated that HCP5 was significantly overexpressed in four OS cell lines. Northern blot assay further proved the higher expression of HCP5 in OS cell lines. To identify the biological role of HCP5 in OS, we silenced the expression of HCP5 in U2OS and MG-63 cells which possessed the highest level of HCP5. CCK-8 and colony formation assay revealed the inhibitory effect of HCP5 knockdown on cell proliferation. Cell apoptosis was found to be increased in cells transfected with sh-HCP5#1. Moreover, cell invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) were reversed by the silencing of HCP5. The results of functional assays showed that HCP5 acted as an oncogene in osteosarcoma.

Moreover, the dual luciferase reporter gene assay system was used to confirm ATG7 is a target gene of miR-210. Furthermore, lung cancer cell line A549 was transfected with either miR-210 mimics or inhibitors and RT-qPCR methods was used to detect the expression of miR-210 and ATG7. Next, MTT assay was used to examine the effect of miR-210 on the growth of the lung cancer cells, and finally, the expression of autophagy related genes, ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1 were detected by Western Blot and ICC assay. We observed that miR-210 was significantly increased and ATG7 was markedly decreased in cancer tissue of patients with lung cancer compared with normal tissue. Moreover, results of dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that ATG7 is a direct target of miR-210. Next, transfection of miR-210 mimics in lung cancer cells induced significant increase in cell proliferation, and transfection of miR-210 inhibitors lead to inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, over-expression of miR-210 induced marked decrease in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and Beclin-1, while transfection of miR-210 inhibitors induced significant increase in the expression of ATG7, LC3-II/LC3-I and beclin-1.

By contrast, EGFR-mutated cancers lacked ALK-specific histological patterns. Although all MUC1 and MUC5AC were expressed in both subtypes, MUC1 expression in ALK\u2009+\u2009cancers was visualized exclusively through cytoplasmic staining, whereas those in EGFR-mutated cancers were predominantly membranous staining in apical area (92.9%) and focally in cytoplasmic staining (7.1%). MUC5AC expression in ALK\u2009+\u2009cancers was exclusively visualized through cytoplasmic staining (100%), whereas EGFR-mutated cancers showed predominantly perinuclear dot-like patterns (90.5%) and focal cytoplasmic staining (9.5%). MUC2 and MUC6 expression was not detected in either type of lung cancer.The high frequency of both MUC1 and MUC5AC cytoplasmic expression, coupled with a lack of MUC2 and MUC6 expression in ALK\u2009+\u2009lung cancer may contribute to the biologically aggressive behavior of ALK\u2009+\u2009cancer.

The use of high-density whole-genome microarray analysis in ameloblastomas and AOT revealed high frequency of genomic gain at 14q32.33, which encompasses the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) gene KIAA0125. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the expression profile of KIAA0125 in these tumors. Thirteen samples were included (five solid/multicystic ameloblastomas, four AOT, and four dental follicles). The relative quantification of KIAA0125 expression was obtained by qPCR and interactions of KIAA0125 were in silico predicted. We detected higher levels of KIAA0125 transcripts in the ameloblastoma group compared to dental follicles (p\u2009=\u20090.042). The expression levels of KIAA0125 in AOT were not different from that of dental follicles. KIAA0125 was predicted to interact with 41 miRNA families. Four miRNAs of these families have been previously reported differentially expressed in ameloblastoma, being miR-135a-5p, miR-204-5p and miR-205-5p upregulated, and miR-150-5p downregulated. The lncRNA KIAA0125 is likely involved in the ameloblastoma pathobiology. LncRNAs hold strong promise as therapeutic targets and experimental validation of this lncRNA functions may lead to tailored therapies targeting KIAA0125 in extensive and recurrent ameloblastoma cases.",

Fifty percent inhibiting concentration (IC50) of adriamycin (ADM) to Eca109 cells was detected by MTT assay, after the treatment of different concentrations of adriamycin (ADM) on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma Eca109 cell line for 24\u2009h. EVs were extracted from culture medium after the treatment of three concentrations of ADM (setting based on the IC50) on Eca109 cells for 24\u2009h.

After the treatment of the extracted EVs on virgin Eca109 cells for 48\u2009h, then intervening these cells for 24\u2009h by different concentrations of ADM, the new values of IC50 were detected by MTT assay. Cell cycle, cell apoptosis and ABCG2 protein expression of these Eca109 cells were detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Linc-VLDLR and ABCG2 mRNA expression in these Eca109 cells were detected by qRT-PCR.Expression of linc-VLDLR and ABCG2 mRNA in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissue were significantly higher than that in esophageal atypical hyperplasia and normal esophagus tissue, P < 0.01.

Linc-VLDLR expression in EVs4 was significantly higher than that in EVs1-3, P < 0.01. After the treatment of EVs1-4 on virgin Eca109 cells for 48\u2009h, new values of IC50 of Eca109 to ADM were detected by MTT. It was found that the IC50 value of group EVs4 was significantly higher than that of other groups, P < 0.05. Flow cytometry results showed that the proliferation index of Eca109 cells in EVs4 was significantly higher than that in EVs1-3 and control groups, P < 0.01. Whereas, there was an obviously downward trend in the apoptosis rate of EVs4, compared to other three groups, P < 0.01. Linc-VLDLR and ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression level in Eca109 cells of EVs4 group were significantly higher than that of EVs1-3 and control groups, P < 0.05.High expression of Linc-VLDLR and ABCG2 gene in esophageal cancer cells affected the formation of esophageal cancer drug resistance. EVs released by drug-resistant cells were proved that they could upregulate the expression of ABCG2 in esophageal cancer cells and thus regulate the drug resistance of esophageal cancer cells, which was related to the linc-VLDLR carried by EVs.",

A higher frequency of concomitant PIK3CA mutations was observed in tumors with KRAS outside codon 13 mutations, with NRAS codon 61 mutations and with BRAF kinase-activated mutations. Moreover, KRAS, PIK3CA, AKT1 and FBXW7 mutations were statistically associated with some clinicopathological features, including location, age or metastasis of CRC patients.

Immunofluorescence staining showed that MFG-E8 was mainly localized in the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor cells, consistent with the immunohistochemical staining results. The high expression levels of MFG-E8 showed a greater association with lymph node metastasis, TNM stage and histological grade (P < 0.001). Moreover, high MFG-E8 expression was related to a shortened overall survival (OS) (P\u2009<\u2009 0.001) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P\u2009<\u2009 0.001). Bioinformatics analysis with a Kaplan-Meier plotter also demonstrated a strong association of MFG-E8 mRNA overexpression with a short OS and DFS compared with low MFG-E8 expression (P\u2009=\u2009 0.040, P\u2009=\u2009 0.005).Our findings indicate that MFG-E8 may be a potential marker for poor prognosis and survival in breast cancer.",

Moreover, we also found that PFN1 was a direct target gene of miR-19a-3p, and in HCC tissues, and there was a significantly inverse correlation between PFN1 mRNA and miR-19a-3p expression.

The association of TSGA10 gene expression with hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and angiogenic factors has remained to be fully elucidated and is still a controversial issue. The present study was designed to investigate this association in patients newly diagnosed with AML.We evaluated TSGA10, HIF-1\u03b1 and VEGF mRNA levels in ND AML patients and healthy subjects using real-time PCR technique. Data were analyzed via comparative Livak method.Based on the results of this study, TSGA10 gene expression was decreased in 28 out of 30 (93.3%) samples while VEGF and HIF-1\u03b1 expression levels were increased in all ND AML patients compared to healthy controls. Diagnostic evaluation was performed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under the curve (AUC) calculation. Respectively, using cut-off relative quantification of 1.604, 0.0329, and 0.0042, the sensitivity values of TSGA10, VEGF, and HIF-1\u03b1 gene expression were 86.7%, 90%, and 100%. Also, specificity values were 100%, 100% and 100%, respectively. TSGA10 expression was shown to be reduced in ND AML patients compared with healthy subjects and we found a negative correlation between TSGA10 and VEGF expression.Since TSGA10 interacts with HIF-1 and affects its transcriptional activity, in ND AML patients with decreased TSGA10 expression, VEGF expression was high suggesting a TSGA10 mediated regulation of HIF-1 target genes. Altogether, the current study showed that TSGA10 could be considered as a tumor suppressor in AML patients.",

After investigating the prognostic value of the 129 differential expressed miRNAs, eight miRNAs were found to be associated with prognosis of patients with ESCC. The clinical significance and bio-function of miR-375 was further examined. We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to identify the top three gene sets that significantly altered between the patients with miR-375 low expression and high expression. In order to explore the mechanism of the development and progression of ESCC, the role of miR-375 in ESCC and its four candidate target genes was examined.

The expression levels of osteoporosis-related genes (ALP, OCN, and OPN) were found to be decreased in hBMSCs treated with sh-BMP1. Mechanically, BMP1 was demonstrated to be the target mRNA of miR-29b-3p. Moreover, increasing studies indicate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are crucial regulators in hBMSCs osteogenic differentiation by exerting ceRNA function. Further mechanism investigation revealed that lncRNA NEAT1 could regulate miR-29b-3p-BMP1 axis in hBMSCs. Finally, rescue assays were performed to validate the specific function of NEAT1-miR-29b-3p-BMP1 axis in the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs.

Currently, we collected 37 paired CRC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues from Jiangsu province and 75 paired CRC tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues from Zhejiang province to conduct a two-stage experiment to study the association between KDM1A methylation and CRC. We used qMSP to measure the KDM1A promoter methylation, and the percentage of methylation reference (PMR) to quantify the KDM1A promoter methylation level.

HSC-T6 cells, BRL-3\u2009A cells and differentiated BM-MSCs were treated by lipopolysaccharide(LPS). shRNAs were used to silence \u03b2-catenin and recombinant plasmids were used to over-express ZEB1. Measurement of cell viability was conducted using MTT assay and Hoechst 33342 staining.

Then, we examined the effect of LncRNA PVT1 on cell viability and colony formation ability by MTT assay and soft agar assay, respectively. In addition, we performed flow cytometry analysis to detect apoptosis induced by GEM. Dual luciferase reporter assay and RIP were used to confirmed the interaction between LncRNA PVT1 and miR-152. Finally, we determined protein level of c-MET, p-PI3K, and p-AKT by westernblot.Results: LncRNA PVT1 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and exhibited the anti-apoptotic property in LncRNA PVT1-overexpressing MG63 cells treated with gemcitabine. While, LncRNA PVT1-depleted MG63/DOX cells treated with gemcitabine exhibited significant lower survival rate and high percentage of apoptosis. Next, we found that LncRNA PVT1 could target and downregulated the level of miR-152. Interestingly, miR-152 greatly rescued the biological outcomes of LncRNA PVT1 not only in MG63 but also in MG63/DOX cells. We observed that LncRNA PVT1 markedly induced PI3K/AKT pathway activation, which was abolished by miR-152 mimics overexpression. Finally, c-MET inhibitor was used to confirm the essential role of c-MET in LncRNA PVT1 and miR-152-regulated PI3K/AKT signaling.Conclusion: We showed thatlncRNA PVT1 played a contributory role in chemoresistance of osteosarcoma cells through c-MET/PI3K/AKT pathway activation, which was largely dependent on miR-152.

     "abstract": "Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignant tumors in humans. Glioblastoma multiforme(GBM) is the most malignant intracranial tumor with a relatively poor prognosis. There promote us to find effective anti-cancer therapies to reduce cancer mortality. By using bioinformatic analysis, we found SSFA2 as a gene with elevated expression in the glioma tissues. We detected the expression of SSFA2 in glioma tissues and in the glioma cell lines, as well as in normal brain tissues. SSFA2 expression was higher in glioma tissues, especially in glioblastoma multiforme than normal brain tissues. Subsequently, we found that down-regulate SSFA2 in glioma cell lines can regulate the cell cycle to reduce the proliferation ability and induce the early apoptosis rate in shSSFA2 cells relative to control cells. Moreover, we found that down-regulate SSFA2 in glioma cell line U87(shSSFA2-U87) inhibited the growth effectiveness compared to the control cell line U87. These result reveals us that SSFA2 may act as oncogene to promote the progression of glioma. For further research specific mechanisms of SSFA2 in gliomas, we used the gene chip to detect the downstream gene in U87. We found that 30 genes also may be as target gene of SSFA2, and we testify the protein expression by western-blot. The result reveal that IL1A, IL1B and CDK6 as target gene of SSFA2 to regulate the progression of glioma. These finding suggest that SSFA2 could be a new therapeutic target for gliomas.",

     "abstract": "There is no doubt that Walter Pagel (1898\u20131983) is one of the most outstanding figures in the history of pathology. Not only his fundamental research on tuberculosis and various other fields of pathology but also his historicomedical publications set international standards and earned him numerous honors throughout the scientific world.Far less known is the fact that Pagel, as a German Jew, was one of the victims of the \u201cThird Reich\u201d: He was dismissed from his job in Heidelberg, felt forced to emigrate in 1933 and fought for reparation after 1945. Accordingly, this article deals with Pagel\u2019s role and fate as a politically persecuted and disenfranchised Jew. It focuses on the general circumstances of his dismissal and forced emigration, but also on Pagel\u2019s treatment in post-war Germany. In addition, the influences of this biographical break on Pagel\u2019s further research career are investigated.The study is based on archival sources and on a re-analysis of the relevant research literature.It points out that Pagel\u2019s emigration took place under difficult circumstances and without clear job prospects. Enormous discipline and mental strength as well as successful networking with supporting mentors allowed Pagel to continue his career in his exile country of England despite poor health. The way in which Pagel was treated in post-war Germany, on the other hand, was less satisfactory: the University of Heidelberg did not offer him any prospect of employment and the \u201creparation procedure\u201d (\u201cWiedergutmachungsverfahren\u201d) resulted in only small pension payments. Instead, Pagel was awarded an honorary doctorate at his home university in 1966.

However, its diagnostic and prognostic values of CRNDE in cancer are not completely clear. Therefore, we conduct a comprehensive study on CRNDE in cancer.Materials and methods: CRNDE expression data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Microarray data were derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to validate its differential expression. Furthermore, the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of CRNDE in cancer, respectively. Finally, we carried out a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic values of CRNDE in cancer.Results: In TCGA database, CRNDE was overexpressed in nine types of cancer, among which polymorphic glioblastoma and colonic adenocarcinoma are the most highly expressed. The area under curves (AUC) of nine cancer types ranged from 0.855 to 0.984. Additionally, the high expression level of CRNDE was significantly associated with poor overall survival only in hepatocellular carcinoma (p\u2009=\u20090.032) among the nine cancers in the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Finally, the results of the meta-analysis on the literatures showed that the pooled sensitivity, specificity, summary receiver operator characteristic curve (SROC), and the overall hazard ratio of CRNDE in cancers were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.71\u20130.82), 0.90 (95% CI: 0.82\u20130.95), 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84\u20130.90), and 1.66 (95% CI: 1.37\u20132.01), respectively.Conclusion: CRNDE could be a potential biomarker for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.",

Immunohistochemistry results showed that the high expression rate of CD47 protein was 46.4% (26/56) and the positive expression rate of PDL1 protein was 37.5% (21/56). PD1 expression was observed in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in approximately 20% of T-LBL/ALL patients, but not expressed on tumor cells of T-LBL/ALL.

A total of 106 cases, who underwent esophagectomy from 2008 to 2010, with two foci from each case, were tested by immunohistochemistry(IHC) as well as 12 cases were tested by RNAscope in this study.We found that 58/106 (54.72%), 66/106 (62.26%), 75/106 (70.75%%) of ESCC showed high expression of ZNF750, EP300, MTOR, respectively by IHC, and 8/12 (66.67%), 10/12 (83.33%), 4/12 (33.33%) and 6/12 (50%) showed high expression of ZNF750, EP300, MTOR and KMT2D, respectively by RNAscope. Multivariate analysis showed that MTOR expression was an independent infavorable prognostic factor of overall survival (OS) (HR\u2009=\u20091.921; P\u2009=\u20090.000). This study also found that 44/106(4151%), 37/106 (34.91%), 39/106(36.79%) of ESCC showed heterogeneous expression of ZNF750, EP300 and MTOR respectively by IHC, 8/12(66.67%), 8/12(66.67%), 4/12(33.33%), 4/12(33.33%) of ZNF750, EP300, MTOR and KMT2D respectively by RNAscope, IHC and RNAscope could successfully detect a high prevalence of ITH. In conclusion, findings of this study showed that ZNF750, EP300, MTOR and KMT2D heterogeneously expressed in ESCC. High expression of ZNF750 related to a better outcome, while EP300 and MTOR related to a poor prognosis.",

     "abstract": "SOX7 downregulation caused by its promoter methylation was associated with poor survival in several types of human solid tumors. However, the pattern of SOX7 methylation and its clinical significance are less studied in hematological malignancies. Herein, we evaluated the methylation pattern of SOX7 in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and determined its clinical implication in patients with MDS.SOX7 methylation was determined by real-time quantitative methylation-specific PCR (RQ-MSP) in 99 MDS patients. Bisulfite sequencing PCR was applied to confirm the results of RQ-MSP.SOX7 methylation was detected in 55.6% of 99 patients but not in healthy donors. No correlation was found between SOX7 methylation and clinical parameters including patient age, gender, white blood cell count, hemoglobin, and platelet count. However, patients with SOX7 methylation harbored more U2AF1 mutation than patients without SOX7 methylation (P\u2009=\u20090.015). Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that the patients with SOX7 methylation presented reduced overall survival (OS) (P\u2009=\u2009 0.034). Furthermore, subgroup analysis indicated that SOX7 methylation was associated with poor OS in male patients (P\u2009=\u20090.034) and in patients older than 60 years (P\u2009=\u20090.019). According to the multivariate analysis, SOX7 methylation remained as an independent prognosis factor in MDS patients both as dichotomous (HR\u2009=\u20092.14, P\u2009=\u2009 0.041) and as continuous (HR\u2009=\u20091.55, P\u2009=\u2009 0.042) variable.

CD151, a member of transmembrane 4 superfamily, has now been confirmed to be involved in tumor progression including the proliferation, migration, invasion and metastasis of tumor cells. GSK-3\u03b2/P21/cyclinD signaling pathway plays a critical role in the cell cycle progression, regulating cellular proliferation. In this study, CD151 protein and mRNA levels were examined by western blot and RT-PCR. The proliferation of SK-NEP-1 cells was examined by CCK8 assay and the migration of SK-NEP-1 cells was detected with wound healing assay. Furthermore, p-GSK3\u03b2 protein, GSK3\u03b2 protein, p21protein and CyclinD protein were examined by western blot to verify whether CD151 could regulate the Wilms\u2019tumor progression via the GSK-3\u03b2/P21/cyclinD signaling pathway. The RT-PCR and western blot results showed that CD151 protein was upregulated in Wilms\u2019tumor cells compared with the control. The results by CCK8 assay and wound healing assay demonstrated that CD151 overexpression promoted the proliferation and migration in SK-NEP-1 cells and CD151 interference showed the opposite effects. Western blot assay revealed that CD151 activated the GSK-3\u03b2/P21/cyclinD signaling pathway and upregulated the expression of p-GSK3\u03b2 protein, p21protein and CyclinD protein. It was also verified that CD151 promotes proliferation and migration of SK-NEP-1 cells through the GSK-3\u03b2/P21/cyclinD signaling pathway in this study. The specific aim of the study is to investigate and verify the role of CD151 in Wilm\u2019s tumor.

After A549 cells were transfected with miR-181b mimic or si-Sox6, the proliferation, migration and cell cycle distribution of A549 were evaluated using cell counting kit-8 assay, transwell assay and flow cytometry. The levels of cell cycle-related proteins and Sox6 were analyzed by western blotting. Gene targets of miR-181b were predicted via bioinformatics analysis and verified using a dual-luciferase reporter gene assay.Expression of miR-181b was significantly downregulated in lung cancer tissues (P\u2009<\u20090.05), and was inversely correlated with the degree of cell differentiation and clinical stages of lung cancer (both P\u2009<\u20090.05). Additionally, the expression of miR-181b was significantly lower in adenocarcinoma compared with squamous cell carcinoma in the lungs (P\u2009<\u20090.05). Overexpression of miR-181b significantly decreased the protein level of Sox6 and significantly suppressed the cell proliferation and metastasis (both P\u2009<\u20090.05); this effect was also observed in A549 cells transfected with si-Sox6. The luciferase activity of a Sox6 3\u2032-untranslated region-based reporter construct was significantly lower when transfected with miR-181b (P\u2009<\u20090.05), which suggests that Sox6 is a direct target of miR-181b.The results of the present study suggest that miR-181b may function as a tumor inhibitor in the development of lung cancer via targeting Sox6 to decrease the proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer cells.",

We sought to investigate the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of the cribriform pattern in lung adenocarcinomas. Histologic subtypes were evaluated in 395 patients who underwent complete resection for invasive lung adenocarcinomas between 2011 and 2013. Cribriform pattern was correlated with clinicopathological factors as well as molecular and survival data. One hundred and thirty cases (33%) were present with cribriform pattern (5\u2013100%; mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD, 24% \u00b1 22%). Thirty two (8%) of those were reclassified into cribriform predominant tumors. Presence of cribriform pattern (\u22655%) was significantly associated with lymph/vascular invasion (P\uff1c0.001), nodal positivity (P = 0.003), higher T stage(P = 0.005) and higher TNM stage (P = 0.001).

The DFS or OS for cribriform predominant tumors was similar to that for solid or micropapillary tumors. In multivariate analysis, cribriform pattern (\u226510%) or cribriform predominant subtype was an independent predictor for DFS. Cribriform pattern was a specific pattern compared to other acinar patterns, presenting with more aggressive behavior. Moreover, presence of cribriform pattern was a strong predictor for worse prognosis and should be considered a high grade pattern. Our study provides further evidence for cribriform pattern to be acknowledged as an independent subtype in the future classification.",

In addition, individual examples show that Krauspe\u2019s \u201cexpert reports\u201d on colleagues before 1945, but also in post-war Germany, were obviously ideologically influenced.

It is the leading cause of senile dementia that is mainly represented as neurocognitive symptoms, including progressive memory impairment, cognitive disorder, personality change and language barrier, etc. The pathogeny and nosogenesis of AD have not been clearly explained. AD is characterized by extracellular senile plaques (SP) formed by beta amyloid (A\u03b2) deposition and neurofibrillary tangles in neuronal cells formed by hyperphosphorylation of tau, as well as the deficiency of neuronal with gliosis. However, the complete spectrum of regulating factors in molecular level that affect the pathogenesis of AD is unclear.

The metastatic stage of disease is extremely difficult to treat and the mortality rate is still high. Emerging evidence suggested that oxidative stress (OS) is involved in the pathophysiological pathways of several chronic diseases and in the transformation and progression of many common cancers, including melanoma. In particular, it has emerged that OS interacts with inflammatory and immune response, all taking part in the melanomagenic process. In light of the interest shown by the scientific community for this topic, it was analysed the association between melanoma and oxidative stress. A systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guideline employing PubMed database. It identified n\u2009=\u200929 articles which investigated this aspect. Melanoma cells resulted to have adaptive mechanisms to overcome effects of high reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Furthermore, OS influences the metastatic ability of melanoma cells and their resistance to therapy. Nonetheless, the included studies were conducted on heterogeneous patient population and with differences in the design of the studies and in the protocols. Therefore, it is mandatory performing further studies which analyze all the aspect of OS pathways: ROS imbalance, its effect to proliferation and metastasis, role of microenvironment, ROS effect to drug resistance. All this in order to understand the role of oxidative stress in the complex biology of melanoma and to provide possibilities of defining new strategy of therapy.",

As a member of miRNAs family, miR-873-5p has been proved to be a tumor suppressor in some human cancers. Here, we aim to investigate the effects of miR-873-5p on the migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of colorectal cancer cells. The low expression of miR-873-5p in colorectal cancer cells was identified by conducting qRT-PCR analysis. Gain of function assays were designed and conducted to demonstrate the specific function of miR-873-5p overexpression in colorectal cancer progression. Transwell assay and western blot assay were conducted and revealed that miR-873-5p inhibited cell migration, invasion and EMT formation. To find the downstream molecular mechanism of miR-873-5p, mechanism assays were designed and performed to find the downstream target of miR-873-5p. ZEB1 (Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox 1) was certified to be the target of miR-873-5p through bioinformatics analysis, luciferase activity assay and pull-down assay. Finally, rescue assays were carried out to demonstrate the effects of miR-873-5p-ZEB1 axis on the migration, invasion and EMT process of colorectal cancer cells. In conclusion, we confirmed that miR-873-5p suppressed cell migration, invasion and EMT in colorectal cancer via targeting ZEB1.",

     "abstract": "Adult T-cell leukemia\u2013lymphoma (ATL) is a mature T-cell malignancy caused by human T-cell leukemia virus type I infection and is known to exhibit cutaneous involvement in 50% or more patients. Few studies have evaluated the clinicopathological significance of programmed death-1 (PD-1) expression in the cutaneous lesions of ATL.Skin biopsy specimens from 29 ATL patients with cutaneous lesions were evaluated regarding the clinicopathological feature, survival outcome, and PD-1 expression level on infilitrated CD3+CD4\u202f+\u202fCD25+ cells. The optimal cut-off point of PD-1 expression for clinicopathological feature and outcome was determined as the value of the maximum Youden index by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.PD-1 was expressed broadly from zero to 90% on the skin biopsy specimens of the 29 patints, with the median value of 50%. The PD-1-expression level was significantly higher in the poorer-prognosis eruption group (nodulotumoral, erythrodermic and purpuric types) (P\u202f=\u202f0.003), in the poorer histopathological infiltration patterns (diffuse and nodular) (P\u202f=\u202f0.007), and in the poorer infiltrating cell-size group (large-sized cells) (P\u202f=\u202f0.017) than in the corresponding group. ROC curve analyses showed that the optimal cut-off value for PD-1-expression level to predict the poorer-prognosis eruption, the poorer- histopathological infiltration pattern, the poorer infiltration cell size, and the poorer outcome (death) was 60%, 50%, 50%, and 80%, respectively. Patients with high PD-1 expression had a shorter median survival time than those with low PD-1 expression (18.2 months vs. 26.0 months), but the difference was not statistically significant.ATL patients with cutaneous lesions in which PD-1 were highly expressed have more advanced dermatological and histopathological patterns and possibly worse survival than those with low PD-1 expression on cutaneous lesions.

Moreover, the relationship of CDCA7L expression with the clinicopathological characteristics in glioma patients, including age, gender, tumor size, cystic change, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) score, tumor location, extent of resection, WHO grade, adjuvant therapy and tumor recurrence, was analyzed in this study. In addition, the CDCA7L small interfering (si) RNA was constructed and transfected into the glioma U251 cells, so as to examine the role of CDCA7L in glioma patients. Besides, the changes in U251 cell invasion after transfection with CDCA7L siRNA were also monitored through Transwell assay.Our results suggested that CDCA7L expression was up-regulated in different glioma types, including glioblastoma, oligodendroglioma, diffuse astrocytoma and anaplastic astrocytoma. Moreover, the current retrospective cohort study indicated that high CDCA7L expression was associated with tumor size, WHO grade, adjuvant therapy and recurrence, as well as the poor overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in glioma patients. Lastly, CDCA7L expression was knocked down using CDCA7L siRNA, which could block the invasion abilities of glioma U251 cells.CDCA7L is highly expressed in human glioma tissues and a high CDCA7L expression level predicts the dismal prognosis for glioma patients. Moreover, CDCA7L can promote glioma invasion, which can serve as an independent potential prognostic biomarker for glioma patients.",

Our results demonstrated that the positive rate of SLP-2 expression in CRC tissues was higher than that in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P\u2009<\u20090.05); positive SLP-2 expression predicted poorer prognosis of CRC patients as an independent risk factor (P\u2009<\u20090.05).

Combining multiple bioinformatic tools, we studied the miR-449c-5p expression levels in HCC tissues and explored possible target genes and related signaling pathways. First, miR-449c-5p expression data from microarrays provided by publicly available sources were mined and analyzed using various meta-analysis methods. Next, genes that were downregulated after miR-449c-5p mimic transfection into HCC cells were identified, and in silico methods were used to predict potential target genes. Several bioinformatic assessments were also performed to evaluate the possible signaling pathways of miR-449c-5p in HCC. Five microarrays were included in the current study, including GSE98269, GSE64632, GSE74618, GSE40744 and GSE57555. The standard mean difference was 0.44 (0.07\u20130.80), and the area under the curve was 0.68 (0.63\u20130.72), as assessed by meta-analyses, which consistently indicated the upregulation of miR-449c-5p in HCC tissues. A total of 2244 genes were downregulated after miR-449c-5p mimic transfection into an HCC cell line, while 5217 target genes were predicted by in silico methods. The overlap of these two gene pools led to a final group of 428 potential target genes of miR-449c-5p. These 428 potential target genes were primarily enriched in the homologous recombination pathway, which includes DNA Polymerase Delta 3 (POLD3). Data mining with Oncomine and the Human Protein Atlas showed a decreasing trend in POLD3 mRNA and protein levels in HCC tissue samples. This evidence suggests that miR-449c-5p could play an essential role in HCC through various pathways and that POLD3 could be a potential miR-449c-5p target. However, these in silico findings should be validated with further experiments.",

Therefore, our aims were to probe whether IRGM regulates glioma proliferation and autophagy. In this study, we found that 47 glioma specimens had more IRGM expression than 11 non-cancerous brain tissues with immunohistochemistry. IRGM was also up-regulated in human glioma cell lines U87, U251 and A172 and so on compared with immortalized astrocytes. Importantly, overexpression of IRGM significantly increased the cell colonies formation, cell proliferation and Akt activation (Thr308 and Ser473 sites) than matched control. On another hand, all of IRGM, autophagy marker LC3II and autophagy adaptor p62 gradually increased after starvation 2 and 4\u2009h. Furthermore, western blot and immunofluorescence results showed that knockdown of IRGM inhibited the formation of LC3-II and the expression of p62.

Immunoreactive cells positive for interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 (IL-1\u03b1), IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were detected by an immunohistochemistry (IHC) method.We evaluated overall higher numbers of IL-7, IL-8 and IL-10 (mostly from few (0/+) to almost abundance (++++)) and overall less numbers of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-6 (mostly from no positive (0) to numerous to abundance (+++/++++)) immunoreactive cells in airway epithelium and connective tissue of COPD affected lung. Furthermore, we evaluated statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) higher numbers of immunoreactive cells located in control group airway epithelium for IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, and IL-12 compared to mucosal and submucosal connective tissue. Moreover, in COPD group airway epithelium for IL-1\u03b1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, and IL-10. We found no statistically significant difference between the numbers of IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 immunoreactive cells in airway epithelium and connective tissue of COPD affected lung. In comparison with the control group, we found statistically significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) higher numbers of immunoreactive cells positive for all examined markers in COPD group.Increased numbers of IL-1\u03b1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 immunoreactive cells highlight the local significance of these markers in COPD pathogenesis. Moreover, the pattern with dominance of immunoreactive cells in COPD affected airway epithelium over connective tissue is highlighting the essentials of epithelium in inflammatory signalling.",

In the current study, we explored whether magnesium isoglycyrrhizinate (MgIg) could alleviate ANP-induced liver injury in obese rats.Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were selected for the present study, and the ANP model was established by retrograde injection of 5% sodium taurocholate into the biliary-pancreatic duct. Thirty-six SD rats were randomly assigned to six groups: the normal (N), standard rat chow (SRC) normal (SN), SRC ANP (S-ANP), high-fat diet (HFD) normal (H\u2013N), HFD ANP (H-ANP), and MgIg pretreatment HFD ANP (H-ANPT) groups. The rats in the H-ANPT group were treated with MgIg (30 mg/kg) intragastrically for 7 days before the ANP model was established. The rats were sacrificed 12 h after ANP was established, and the blood and pancreatic and liver tissues were collected. Differences in the physiology, pathology and cellular and molecular responses of the rats in each group were examined.Analyses of serum amylase lipase, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase indicated that obesity aggravated ANP-induced hepatic injury and that MgIg improved liver function. The superoxide dismutase, malondialdehyde, M1 macrophage, M2 macrophage, neutrophil, NF-\u03baB, IL-1\u03b2 and caspase-3 levels in liver tissue showed that MgIg attenuated H-ANP-induced hepatic injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation.Obesity aggravated ANP-induced liver injury via oxidative stress and inflammatory reactions. MgIg alleviated oxidative stress and decreased the inflammatory reaction, protecting the liver against the AHI induced by ANP in obese rats.",

We found that the expression of miR-17 was significantly up-regulated in OS cell lines. MiR-17 inhibitor inhibited the proliferation ability, and induced apoptosis of OS cells. Besides, miR-17 inhibitor prevented the migration and invasion of OS cells. Further, we identified that SASH1 was a target gene of miR-17. In addition, knockdown of miR-17 increased the protein expression of SASH1, and regulate related genes of cell proliferation, invasion and anti-apoptosis in the downstream of OS cells. These findings indicated that miR-17 was over-expressed and promoted cell proliferation, migration and inhibited cell apoptosis by targeting SASH1 in OS cells.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation has been implicated in the development of the majority of human cancers. However, the association of aberrant DNA methylation with the clinical characteristics of uterine corpus endometrial carcinoma (UCEC) has not been fully explored. We performed an integrative analysis in order to examine the genome-wide DNA methylation profile and the gene expression profile of 432 UCEC samples and 46 normal tissue samples. A total of 793 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that were associated with 472 protein-coding genes were identified, including 622 hypermethylated DMRs and 171 hypomethylated DMRs. These DMRs were capable of differentiating UCEC from normal tissues with an accuracy of 99.07% using an unsupervised hierarchical clustering method. The genomic analysis suggested that the hypermethylated DMRs were located in CpG island regions nearer to the transcription start site (TSS) compared with the hypomethylated DMRs. Functional analysis for genes associated with DMRs revealed an enrichment of methylated genes that were involved in key cancer-related biological processes and pathways, such as cell adhesion, cell differentiation and the cAMP signaling pathway. Finally, we performed a correlation analysis of the methylation levels of DMRs and patient survival time, and identified 130 DMRs. These molecular markers could classify patients into high-risk and low-risk groups with significantly different overall survival. Taken together, the present study revealed the potential applications of the detection of aberrant DNA methylation as a valuable prognostic marker for UCEC. The current findings may aid the therapeutic exploitation of UCEC treatment strategies and improve our understanding regarding the regulation of methylation in UCEC.",

     "abstract": "The aim of the study was to perform a pathohistological and immunohistochemical analysis of squamous cell (SC) carcinogenesis markers on epithelial linings of vocal cord polyps.The vocal box, being a heavily burdened organ with intensive cell renewal and regenerative processes, is therefore a favourable environment for constant epithelial growth and hyperplasia. In our ongoing projects on laryngeal carcinogenesis and research on laryngeal tissue, we encountered atypia on diagnosed nodules and polyps that are usually considered as benign formations, resulting from the above-mentioned cell renewal and regeneration, which lead to further investigation.The purpose was to see if changes in molecular markers of SC carcinogenesis follow, or, may appear in immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis, before histological atypia in standard haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, and contribute in early diagnosis of potentially suspect polyps.After classical pathohistological (PH) analysis on HE slides, IHC analysis of EGFR, cyclin D1, p53, Ki-67, and IMP3 was performed on tissue microarrays of laryngeal tissue (50 samples), ranging from normal to hyperplastic lesions with no atypia (34 samples), low-grade atypia (11 samples), and high-grade atypia (5 samples).This study established an increase and correlation of EGFR, cyclin D1, p53, Ki-67 and IMP3 IHC expressions with pathohistological findings of dysplasia in glottic polypoid lesions. Low and high-grade dysplasia had statistically higher percentages of EGFR-positive cells than normal epithelium and simple hyperplasia (SH) (low vs. normal/SH P\u2009=\u20090.007; high vs. normal/SH P\u2009=\u20090.001). High-grade dysplasia had statistically more positive cells than low-grade dysplasia (P\u2009=\u20090.004), and low-grade dysplasia had statistically more positive cells than specimens without atypia (P\u2009=\u20090.007). The percentage of positive cells was statistically higher for cyclin D1, p53 and Ki-67 in high-grade dysplasia versus low-grade dysplasia (cyclin D1 P\u2009=\u20090.011, p53 P\u2009=\u20090.002; Ki-67 P\u2009=\u20090.026; respectively) and versus normal epithelium and SH (cyclin D1 P\u2009=\u20090.003; p53 P\u2009=\u20090.001; Ki-67 P\u2009=\u20090.002; respectively). An increase of IMP3-positive cells with an increase of atypical changes in the laryngeal epithelium, from superficial towards basal layers was noticed, contrary to the usually seen positivity pattern of SC carcinogenesis markers from basal to superficial layers. A statistically significant difference of IMP3 IHC staining between the pathohistological groups (P\u2009=\u20090.003) was recorded.Only polyps that present with simple hyperplasia as the greatest mucosal change can be considered as benign formations.Pathohistologically detected atypia in polypoid changes of vocal cords, confirmed by molecular atypia with an increase of SC carcinogenesis markers, suggest their inclusion in studies of laryngeal carcinogenesis.Our results suggest that in problematic cases IHC analysis could be of interest in detection of biological aggressiveness in polypoid laryngeal tissue and beneficiary for polyp patients\u2019 follow-up.Further research of laryngeal carcinogenesis markers and their meaning in fibrovascular polyps is of interest.",

     "abstract": "Cancer immunotherapy has achieved unprecedented success in the treatment of cancer. However, different patients have different responses to immunotherapy. More and more studies have shown that tumor immune heterogeneity has an important influence on the prognosis of cancer. Therefore, understanding the clinical impact of tumor immune infiltration and the regulatory mechanism of RNA molecules is crucial for exploring the pathogenesis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and the development of immunotherapy protocols.The endogenous competitive RNA hypothesis provides new ideas for studying immune heterogeneity. Therefore, by using the method of immune genomics, this article explores the relationship between immune infiltration and prognosis of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, and found that B-cell immune infiltration highly affects the survival of patients. Through differential analysis, differential mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs were extracted, and 318 differentially expressed mRNAs related to B cell immunity were screened by correlation analysis, and prognosis of patients with COX risk regression model was predicted and analyzed. Through multiple database searches, an immune-related ceRNA regulatory network was constructed, containing 3 key mRNAs, 4 miRNAs, and 50 lncRNAs. Three mRNAs and most miRNAs, lncRNAs, are significantly associated with LUAD prognosis. Bioinformatics analysis of the network showed that LINC00337 may up-regulate the expression of PBK and KIF23 through competitive binding of has-mir-373 and has-mir-519d. The competitive binding of has-mir-373 and has-mir-372 can up-regulate the expression of SLC7A11. The interaction between these RNAs may have an important regulatory role in the immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma, thereby affecting the patient's prognosis and immunotherapy efficacy.",

However, the detailed expression profile of TAG72 and its prognostic effect in CRC are not clear yet. We investigated the relationship between tumor associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72) expression and clinicopathologic characteristics in CRC using 3E8 antibody, a fully humanized antibody with the highest affinity to TAG-72. Immunohistochemical staining for TAG-72 was performed in 578 CRC patients, and the results were analyzed using a modified Remmele scoring system (score: 0\u201312). Of the 578 patients, 144 (24.9%) composed the TAG-72 overexpression (TAG-72high) group. TAG-72high was significantly associated with microsatellite stable tumor (P\u2009=\u2009.002), lymphatic invasion (P\u2009=\u2009.001), venous invasion (P\u2009=\u2009.005), and high pN status (P\u2009<\u2009.001).

     "abstract": "Liver cancer is one of the few tumors with a steadily increasing morbidity and mortality; hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of primary liver cancer. We combined the expression profiles of Chaperonin Containing T-complex 1 Subunit 3 (CCT3) in HCC tissues based on microarray and RNA-sequencing data. The CCT3 expression levels were extracted and examined based on 421 samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (HCC, n\u2009=\u2009371; non-HCC, n\u2009=\u200950) and 3851 samples from 31 microarray or RNA-sequencing datasets (HCC, n\u2009=\u20091975; non-tumor\u2009=\u20091876). We used a variety of meta-analytic methods, including SMD forest maps, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis and sROC curves, to confirm the final results. Meanwhile, database-derived immunohistochemistry data was used for validation. We also further explained the potential mechanism of CCT3 in HCC through signal pathway analyses and PPI network construction with the CCT3 co-expressed genes. The mRNA and protein expression of CCT3 in HCC tissues were higher than in non-HCC tissues. The expression of CCT3 differed between groups when grouped according to clinicopathological parameters, such as race, family history, and histological grade. The results of standardised mean difference (SMD) forest map and summary receiver operating characteristic (sROC) curve revealed that CCT3 was highly expressed in HCC tissues and had a high ability to distinguish between cancer tissues and non-cancer tissues. The main form of CCT3 gene alteration in HCC was mRNA up-regulation and amplification (23%), and the most common mutation type was missense. The mRNA expression of CCT3 in HCC was negatively correlated with DNA methylation. According to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis, CCT3 can influence HCC occurrence and development through cell cycle and DNA replication pathways. In summary, this study carries out the staging and prognostic analysis of HCC. It suggests that CCT3 might play an important part in the tumorigenesis and progression of HCC and may have a certain prognostic value in HCC. Moreover, CCT3 might represent a promising biomarker for HCC.",

During operations, nodular lesions of the peritoneum are often sent for frozen section (FS). For pathologists, FS of the peritoneum is challenging due to sparse and discohesive tumor cells in a fibrotic background.Methods: To explore diagnostic accuracy and diagnostic pitfalls of FS in this setting, we retrospectively collected 252 peritoneal biopsies in cases with GC from January 2006 to May 2017 and compared corresponding permanent sections and patient prognosis. After review, 6 cases (2.4%) were discrepant: positive conversion was identified in 5 cases due to scarce tumor cells associated with severe fibrosis and inflammation; negative conversion was identified in one case due to papillary mesothelial cell proliferation masquerading as carcinoma.Results: Two hundred cases were finally confirmed as positive for tumor cells. Of these, 185 (92.5%) patients died of GC, with survival times ranging from 7 to 3574 (mean 415) days after operation. Fifty-two (20.6%) cases were negative for tumor, and pathologic findings included chronic inflammation with fibrosis (N\u2009=\u200925: associated with previous operation, 10; idiopathic, 15) and papillary mesothelial cell proliferation (N\u2009=\u20099). All 5 patients with frozen diagnosis converted to positive results died of GC during follow up. A total of 19 patients with peritoneal nodules diagnosed as benign on FS died with GC (79.0%), and their survival times ranged from 87 to 3649 (mean 833) days.Conclusions: Peritoneal biopsies in patients with GC were mostly carcinoma, followed by chronic inflammation with fibrosis and papillary mesothelial cell proliferation.

     "abstract": "\u03b22-microglobulin (B2M), a component of major histocompatibility complex class I, plays an important role in host immune reaction to tumor, and inactivation of B2M is known to contribute to resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) treatment. To further characterize the B2M alterations in tumors, we analyzed B2M hotspot mutations in 2765 benign and malignant tumor tissues by Sanger sequencing and found B2M mutations in 9 (7.5%) microsatellite-unstable (MSU) colorectal cancers (CRCs) and 3 leukemias (0.6\u20131.3%), but not in other tumors. Targeted sequencing panel analysis for MSU CRCs showed that B2M-mutated MSU CRCs harbored more driver mutations including TP53 than B2M-wild-type MSU CRCs. Of note, bi-allelic B2M alterations, which had been known to be accumulated during ICB treatment, were frequently found (3/9) in ICB treatment-naive CRCs. Clinicopathologic parameters including CD8\u2009+\u2009T cell numbers, cancer stages and patients\u2019 survival, however, were not significantly different between B2M-mutated and B2M-wild-type MSU CRCs. Our results indicate that B2M mutation abundance is tissue type-specific (e.g., MSU CRCs) and that genetic makeup of B2M mutation might possibly shape the MSU CRC genomes even before the ICB therapies. Our results show that B2M mutation is common in MSU CRCs, which is one of the main targets for ICB treatment, suggesting that frequent B2M mutation status should be reminded for MSU CRCs in patient selection of ICB.",

     "abstract": "The ultrastructural immunolocalization of telomerase and hyaluronate has been studied in a case of oropharyngeal squamous carcinoma. Immunofluorescence shows that telomerase immunolabeling is present in the cytoplasm and in nuclei of some keratinocytes during their migration into the underlying connective tissue. The electron microscope shows that the nuclear localization of telomerase mainly occurs in the large nucleoli and in likely Cajal bodies, the sites of assembling and maturation of proteins forming the telomerase complex. Aside ribosomes, the nucleolus has a role in the biosynthesis of this reverse transcriptase during cell proliferation in normal tissues and in tumors. The cytoplasmic labeling for telomerase is frequently associated with an irregular network of keratin bundles but the significance of this observation is unclear. Hyaluronate, detected through ultrastructural immunolocalization of a hyaluronate binding protein, is abundant mostly along the cell membrane of the detaching basal keratinocytes during epithelial mesenchymal transition. A coat of hyaluronate surrounds the free keratinocytes of the squamous epithelium and is present around the connective cells present underneath. The study supports the hypothesis that hyaluronate forms a pathway along which epithelial cells can migrate during epidermal mesenchymal transition and may also shield cancer cells from immune cells.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic cancer (PaC) is one of the deadliest types of tumor, and it is regarded as a fatal disease, with a 5-year survival rate less than 10%. Most clinical diagnoses for PaC are made at an advanced stage because of the insidious onset of the disease, which leads to an extremely poor prognosis.The relationship between diabetes mellitus (DM) and PaC has been established by several decades of research, and the prevalence of DM in patients with PaC has been reported to be 40%, with half of the patients having developed new-onset DM within 2 years or less. Increasing evidence suggests that new-onset DM is associated with a high prevalence of PaC, and PaC resection ameliorates DM. Therefore, screening for PaC may be needed in patients with newly developed DM.The objective of this review was to present our current understanding of biomarkers for PaC-associated new-onset DM (PCAND), to offer a perspective on the prospects and problems of using this strategy for early screening to differentiate PCAND from new-onset type 2 DM not associated with PaC and to suggest candidate biomarkers to use for PaC screening in patients with new-onset DM. Finding sensitive and specific biomarkers to manage these patients constitutes a challenge for the research community and for public health policies.",

     "abstract": "Gastric intestinal metaplasia is a precursor for gastric dysplasia, which is in turn, a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. Gastric metaplasia and dysplasia are known as gastric precancerous lesions (GPLs), which are essential stages in the progression from normal gastric mucosa to gastric cancer (GC) or gastric adenocarcinoma. Genetically-engineered mice have become essential tools in various aspects of GC research, including mechanistic studies and drug discovery. Studies in mouse models have contributed significantly to our understanding of the pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms underlying GPLs and GC. With the development and improvement of gene transfer technology, investigators have created a variety of transgenic and gene knockout mouse models for GPLs, such as H/K-ATPase transgenic and knockout mutant mice and gastrin gene knockout mice. Combined with Helicobacter infection, and treatment with chemical carcinogens, these mice develop GPLs or GC and thus provide models for studying the molecular biology of GC, which may lead to the discovery and development of novel drugs. In this review, we discuss recent progress in the use of genetically-engineered mouse models for GPL research, with particular emphasis on the importance of examining the gastric mucosa at the histological level to investigate morphological changes of GPL and GC and associated protein and gene expression.",

Oxidative stress has been associated with the etiopathogenesis of recurrent miscarriages, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and stillbirth. Both, the exacerbated consumption of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and the increased synthesis of reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide, peroxynitrite, and hydrogen peroxide, induce phospholipid peroxidation and endothelial dysfunction, impaired invasion and death of trophoblast cells, impaired decidualization, and remodeling of maternal spiral arteries. It has been postulated that melatonin induces specific biochemical responses that regulate cell proliferation in fetuses, and that its antioxidant action promotes bioavailability of nitric oxide and, thus, placental perfusion and also fetal nutrition and oxygenation. Therefore, the therapeutic action of melatonin has been the subject of major studies that aim to minimize or prevent different injuries affecting this pediatric age group, such as intrauterine growth restriction, encephalopathy, chronic lung diseases, retinopathy of prematurity Conclusion: the results antioxidant and indicate that melatonin is an important therapy for the clinical treatment of these diseases.",

The elevated percentage of lymphocyte in peripheral blood can be seen in 22 cases, and elevated LDH level in 24 cases. Abnormal blood counts can be seen in 26 cases before operation, and 22 cases remission to normal level partly or completely after operation. The clinical symptoms included abdominal pain or distension, fatigue, fever, and weight loss, etc. Seventeen cases present with lymphoadenopathy of abdomen or other sites. Fourteen cases were stage I or II, whereas 6 were stage III, 28 were stage IV. Forty-three cases were splenic B-cell marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL)(48.8%,21/43), DLBCL(23.3%,10/43), splenic diffuse red pulp small B-cell lymphoma (SDRPSBL)(11.6%,5/43), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL)(9.3%,4/43), follicular lymphoma (FL)(4.7%,2/43), composite lymphoma (CL, DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma)(2.3%,1/43) in turn, and the remaining 10 cases were chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (n\u202f=\u202f4), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) (n\u202f=\u202f1), hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTL) (n\u202f=\u202f5).

Luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate the direct targeting of EGFR by miR-520a-3p. Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays ware utilized to analyze the role of lidocaine in CRC cells. The results indicated that 500 and 1000 \u03bcM lidocaine over 24\u2009h inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis of CRC cells. Compared with the control group, the expression of EGFR was suppressed by lidocaine (500 \u03bcM) in CRC cells. Furthermore, miR-520a-3p could directly targets EGFR in CRC cells.

Finally, rescue assays were performed to confirm the influence of TP73-AS1-miR-194-5p-SDAD1 axis on GC development.TP73-AS1 was upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines. Furthermore, TP73-AS1 exerted oncogenic role in GC through promoting cell growth and metastasis.

Proteins expression profiles were evaluated statistically for their correlation with patients demographic and clinicopathological variables (grade of dysplasia, inflammation, recurrence) as well as with markers of proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (7-AAD) as determined by flow cytometry analysis.SIP lesions presented increased Caveolin-1 immunopositivity compared to NP (62.2%, vs 40.9%; p\u2009=\u20090.045). Cytoplasmic staining was observed only in epithelium\u2019s basal and suprabasal layers.

Therefore, this study is aimed to investigate the expression of all known splice variants of DAB2IP and SPRY2 in prostate tissue.Fresh Prostate tissue samples (50 prostate cancer/ matched normal tissue and 30 BPH) were collected and total RNA was extracted followed by cDNA synthesis. The expression of DAB2IP and SPRY2 transcript variants were evaluated using RT-PCR and quantitative Real-time PCR.The results indicated significant down-regulation of DAB2IP transcript variant 1 in cancerous tissues compared to paired normal tissues (P\u2009=\u20090.001) as well as SPRY2 transcript variant 2 in cancerous tissues in comparison with the normal counterparts and BPH (P\u2009=\u20090.008 and P\u2009=\u20090.025, respectively). In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between DAB2IP.1 and SPRY2.2 expression with PSA levels in prostate cancer (P\u2009=\u20090.039 \u03c1 =\u22120.24 and P\u2009=\u20090.045 \u03c1 =\u22120.3, respectively).

We demonstrated through Western blot that DSPP is overexpressed in glioma tissues comparing to normal brain tissues. To investigate the role of DSPP in glioma carcinogenesis, we reduced the DSPP expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) and found that DSPP silencing significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of glioma cells, the critical characteristics of glioma. Furthermore, we showed that DSPP down-regulation significantly decreased the activation of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in glioma cells.

Nonetheless, the role of TRIM23 in gastric cancer (GC) remains uncertain. Our study evaluated the expression of TRIM23 in GC tissues and cell lines, and investigated an association between TRIM23 and survival. In the present study, our results demonstrated that TRIM23 mRNA and protein were frequently over-expressed in GC cell lines and GC tissues. High level of TRIM23 protein correlated with tumor size, tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis (LNM), tumor differentiation, and nerve invasion. Compared with the low TRIM23 protein group, the high TRIM23 protein group was significantly associated with worse prognosis of GC patients. Consistently, the KM-plot database suggested that high TRIM23 mRNA expression was also linked to a poor prognosis in GC patients both in positive and negative subgroups of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). But in the HER2 positive subgroup, the advantages of the low TRIM23 expression on overall survival were much more statistically significant. The univariate analysis indicated that TRIM23 expression correlated with overall survival. The multivariate analysis showed that independent factors of prognosis in GC were lymph node metastasis, vascular invasion, and depth of invasion. In summary, TRIM23 may be associated with progression of GC, and may be considered a therapeutic target for GC patients.",

In contrast, only one case (3%) was positive for PD-L1 in PDACs, and the TPS indicated a low expression. No differences in PD-L1 expression were observed between the two clones, SP263 and E1L3N. High PD-L1 expression in the EUS-FNA sample was found in only one case (11%).Although assessment using the tumor cells of PASC samples obtained from EUS-FNA was difficult, this study suggests the selective expression of PD-L1 in the SCc of PASC.

The aim of our study was to find whether DAB2 and DAB2IP were mutated in gastric (GCs) and colorectal cancers (CRCs) by DNA sequencing. Both DAB2 and DAB2IP have mononucleotide repeats in their coding sequence that could be mutation targets in high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) cancers. We analyzed GC and CRC tissues and found that 8 of 34 GCs (23.5%) and 15 of 79 CRCs (20.0%) with MSI-H harbored DAB2IP frameshift mutations. DAB2 frameshift mutations were found in 2 of 79 CRCs (2.5%) with MSI-H. These mutations were not detected in microsatellite stable (MSS) cancers. We also found intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) of DAB2IP frameshift mutations in 7 of 16 CRCs (43.8%). Loss of DAB2IP protein expression was found in approximately 20% of GCs and CRCs irrespective of MSI and DAB2IP frameshift mutation status. Our study shows that the TSG DAB2IP harbored frameshift mutations and ITH as well as expression loss. Together these tumor alterations might play a role in tumorigenesis of GC and CRC with MSI-H by down-regulating the tumor-inhibiting activities of DAB2IP.",

The assessment is often carried out in a two-step approach where immunohistochemical expression of HER2 protein is first evaluated by conventional microscopy and equivocal cases are further analyzed by in-situ hybridization techniques to assess gene amplification status. In this study we compared conventional manual assessment of immunohistochemical HER2 expression with digital image analysis (DIA) and consensus manual assessment by a panel of three pathologists.From our archive we retrieved sections of 109 invasive breast carcinomas stained for HER2 with corresponding HER2 score from the original pathology report. The glass slides were assessed by three pathologists to reach a consensus score. Next, the slides were scanned into whole slide images and DIA was performed using Aperio Imagescope. The scoring results were then compared with gene amplification status evaluated by dual in-situ hybridization (DISH).Comparing manual assessment with consensus assessment and DIA, good agreement was obtained with weighted kappa coefficients of 0.79 (manual vs. consensus) and 0.67 (manual vs. DIA). When compared with gene status assessment by DISH, agreement analysis yielded weighted kappa coefficients of 0.52 (manual vs. DISH), 0.58 (consensus vs. DISH) and 0.78 (DIA vs. DISH). There were no false negatives by any of the three methods and false positives ranging from 0.9 to 2.8%. The proportion of equivocal cases by each method was 44% (manual), 33.3% (consensus) and 14.7% (DIA). Application of DIA reduced the number of equivocal cases by 67% without increasing the proportion of false negatives.We conclude that DIA is an accurate method to reduce the number of HER2 equivocal cases without affecting the sensitivity of the HER2 assessment.",

Comprehensive histologic review and immunohistochemical staining for TTF-1, ALK, CDX2, and MUC5AC as well as a molecular examination for EGFR and KRAS was performed.Among 7 men and 3 women (mean age, 69.6 years), three patients had metastasis of the N2 lymph nodes; of these, two experienced recurrence, and one died of the disease. Remaining patients were all alive without metastasis or recurrence of disease. On gross examination, all tumors were circumscribed mucoid masses. Histologically, we observed the characteristic mucin pools that were distending and destroying the alveolar walls and low cellularity of tumor cells. Most tumor cells were tall columnar cells with basally-located bland-looking nuclei and intracytoplasmic mucin. CDX2 and TTF-1 were partially positive in all and four patients, respectively. MUC5AC was positive in all cases, at least focally. Seven cases showed peribronchiolar metaplasia-like, ciliated tumor cells.

A 25-year-old Chinese woman with a history of 1 cesarean delivery was admitted to the hospital at 37 weeks\u2019 gestation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the feature of placenta increta. An elective primary cesarean section was scheduled and a healthy baby was born. The patient was suggestive of placenta increta and implantation site was resected. Histology indicated a lesion consisting of epithelioid trophoblastic cells with an intermediate pattern between a classical placental site nodule and an epithelioid trophoblastic tumor. This may be linked to her previous cesarean delivery, which supports the relationship between atypical epithelioid trophoblastic lesion formation and surgical interventions. Her serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was 352.4 IU/L after delivery and gradually decreased to normal level.",

However, there was no enteropathy in the non-tumoral ileal mucosa adjacent to the tumor proper and both the cutaneous and ileal tumors were negative for MATK. Clonality study showed clonal TRG and TRB rearrangement with identical band sizes of the amplicons, confirming primary cutaneous tumor with a late relapse in the ileum.Although PC-PTCL-NOS is an aggressive neoplasm, rare cases such as this might have a long-term survival. Furthermore, the late relapse mimicking MEITL is intriguing and exceptional, in spite the fact that MEITL is a primary intestinal T-cell lymphoma with a typical histopathology and immunophenotype. Detailed clinicopathological and molecular studies are mandatory to elucidate the clonal relationship of metachronous lymphomas, as this has important clinical implication for treatment.

However, since its expression has been also demonstrated in other tumors, GATA3 should be better used in conjunction with other immunohistochemical markers to establish tumor primitivity in metastatic setting.Interestingly, GATA3 expression seems to be significantly correlated with androgen receptor (AR) expression in breast carcinoma. In addition, strong AR expression -defined as immunohistochemical positivity in more than 60% of tumor cells- was suggested to be 100% specific for breast origin in GATA3+ metastases.The aim of this study was to verify whether strong AR expression may actually be useful to determine primivity in GATA3+ metastatic setting. Thus, we investigated AR and GATA3 immuno-expression in a cohort of metastatic tumors derived from urothelial, breast, endometrial and salivary gland carcinomas. We did not find any GATA3 or AR expression in the metastases from endometrial or salivary gland carcinomas, while GATA3 expression was seen in the majority of metastases from urothelial or breast carcinomas. In addition, strong AR expression was seen in 73% and in 47% of metastatic breast and urothelial carcinomas, respectively.On the whole, our findings confirm that GATA3 is sensitive and specific for breast and urothelial origin in metastatic setting.

Starting at two months, TAM-treatment prevented the normal age-dependent increase in body weight, without inducing changes in food intake. Serum levels of cholesterol and of the metabolic enzymes creatine kinase and aspartate aminotransferase were reduced in all TAM treatment periods. Serum levels of the metabolic enzymes alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase were increased after the first month but returned to control levels upon 3 months of drug exposition. Moderate microvesicular steatosis, classified only at the first month of TAM treatment, was reduced afterwards. Our model showed an adaptive response of liver upon 3 months of treatment, suggesting that at the stated conditions, TAM will not promote hepatotoxicity.

Luciferase activity, RT-PCR and western blot assays were used to confirmed the target of miRNA.

Western blot for signaling proteins was used to reveal the mechanism.We first determined that miR-718 mRNA expression levels in PTC samples were reduced. The 3\u2032-UTR of 3-Phosphoinositide Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (PDPK1) was then identified as a target of miR-718. Luciferase assays showed that miR-718 does in fact bind the wild-type PDPK1 3\u2032-UTR. We assessed the effects of miR-718 on p-Akt, Akt, p-mTOR and mTOR expression. We determined that miR-718 negatively regulates their levels, respectively, of Akt-mTOR pathway components. We then assessed the effects of miR-718 on PTC cell behavior. The results revealed that miR-718 negatively regulates PTC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In addition, miR-718 was found to inhibit cell glucose metabolism, likely through the Akt-mTOR pathway.

We demonstrated that HOXC6 was highly expressed in human GBM tissues and three glioma cell lines. The knockdown of HOXC6 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of U87 cells by blocking cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase and induced apoptosis. In addition, we found that the mRNA and protein levels of WIF-1 were substantially increased after transfection with HOXC6-shRNA compared with Ctrl-shRNA in vitro. Consistent with the results of the in vitro assays, the xenograft assay and immunohistochemistry also demonstrated that in response to HOXC6 inhibition, the tumor growth and Ki-67 expression level were inhibited and the WIF-1 expression was increased in vivo.In conclusion, the results of the current study indicate that HOXC6 promotes glioma U87 cell growth through the WIF-1/Wnt signaling pathway and HOXC6 might be a novel target in clinical treatment for gliomas.",

     "abstract": "Malignant glioma is the most common and deadly primary brain tumor in adults. However, the mechanisms underlying the malignancy of glioma remain unclear. In the present study, we found that Fos-related antigen-2 (Fra-2) was overexpressed in most glioma cells, and knockdown of Fra-2 prevented cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Mechanistically, Fra-2 silencing led to a significant reduction in cell-cycle drivers (Cyclin D1 and Cyclin E1), one invasion-associated gene (MMP9), the mesenchymal marker (Vimentin), and induction of the epithelial marker (E-cadherin). Further study confirmed that miR-124-3p decreased the expression of Fra-2 via directly targeting the 3\u2032-UTR, and transfection with miR-124-3p in glioma cells inhibited expression of the above cell-cycle and EMT promoters. Phenotypic experiments also showed that overexpression of Fra-2 weakened the inhibitory effects of miR-124-3p on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of glioma cells. In addition, Fra-2 knockdown impaired the malignant phenotypes enhanced by miR-124-3p inhibition, which suggested a crucial role for the miR-124-3p/Fra-2 pathway in glioma development. Consistently, high expression of Fra-2 was closely associated with low miR-124-3p level and indicated a poor prognosis in patients with glioma. In conclusion, this study indicates the existence of an aberrant miR-124-3p/Fra-2 pathway that results in glioma aggressiveness, which suggests novel therapeutic opportunities for this fatal disease.",

A meta-analysis was carried out to comprehensively explore the relationship between miR-375-3p expression level and clinicopathological features of HNSCC. And summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve analysis was applied for evaluating disease diagnosis value of miR-375-3p. In addition, a biological pathway analysis was also performed to assess the possible molecular mechanism of miR-375-3p in HNSCC.A total of 24 available records and references were added into analysis. The overall pooled meta-analysis outcome revealed a relatively lower expression level of miR-375-3p in HNSCC specimens than that in non-cancerous controls (P\u2009<\u20090.001). And SROC curve analysis showed that the pooled area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 0.90 (95%CI: 0.88\u20130.93). In addition, biological pathway analysis indicated that LAMC1, EDIL3, FN1, VEGFA, IGF2BP2, and IGF2BP3 maybe the latent target genes of miR-375-3p, which were greatly enriched in the pathways of beta3 integrin cell surface interactions and the binding of RNA via the insulin-like growth factor-2 mRNA-binding protein (IGF2BPs/IMPs/VICKZs).MiR-375-3p expression clearly decreased in HNSCC samples compared with non-cancerous controls.

This study was to identify potential therapeutic drugs for DLBCL using the bioinformatics method. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between DLBCL and non-cancer samples were downloaded from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of DEGs were analyzed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery. The R software package (SubpathwayMiner) was used to perform pathway analysis on DEGs affected by drugs found in the Connectivity Map (CMap) database. Protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs were constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes online database and Cytoscape software. In order to identify potential novel drugs for DLBCL, the DLBCL-related pathways and drug-affected pathways were integrated. The results showed that 1927 DEGs were identified from TCGA and GEO. We found 54 significant pathways of DLBCL using KEGG pathway analysis. By integrating pathways, we identified five overlapping pathways and 47 drugs that affected these pathways. The PPI network analysis results showed that the CDK2 is closely associated with three overlapping pathways (cell cycle, p53 signaling pathway, and small cell lung cancer). The further literature verification results showed that etoposide, rinotecan, methotrexate, resveratrol, and irinotecan have been used as classic clinical drugs for DLBCL. Anisomycin, naproxen, gossypol, vorinostat, emetine, mycophenolic acid and daunorubicin also act on DLBCL. It was found through bioinformatics analysis that paclitaxel in the drug-pathway network can be used as a potential novel drug for DLBCL.",

Although routine morphology and immunohistochemistry are adequate for the diagnosis of classical SPCH in surgical specimens, true gross appearance identification of most tumor themselves and diagnosis for some exceptional cases are still very difficult. Furthermore, preoperative imaging and frozen diagnosis remain a challenge.We reported nine original cases of solitary pulmonary capillary hemangioma and summarized the clinical characteristics of twenty-one reported lesions. Imaging materials were reviewed by the image experts of our hospital. Quick hematoxylin-eosin stained intraoperative frozen sections and routine histological diagnosis were re-confirmed by 3 specialist pathologists with at least 10 years of diagnostic experience in our department. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on formalin fixed archival tissue. The surgical methods, following up information and prognosis were retrospectively analyzed.In imaging, three tumors showed solid nodules, three cases displayed mix ground glass nodules, two nodules were pure ground glass density, and one case was a cystic-solid mass. Macroscopically, solitary pulmonary capillary hemangiomas were ill-defined soft hemorrhagic lesion with pale yellow or dark brownish cut surface. Two cases had a clear boundary and seven lesions were poorly demarcated. Typical morphological features were densely proliferating thin-walled capillaries composing of single layer of flatten or cuboidal endothelial cells within the thickened alveolar septa. One case was mistaken for a histiocytogenic lesion during freezing. The cystic-solid lesion showed a hyperplasia capillary network along the submucosal interstitium of bronchioles. Immunohistochemically, tumor endothelial cells were positive for ERG, Fli-1, CD31, CD34 and Vimentin and negative for CK, \u03b1-SMA, TTF-1, HMB45, S-100 and CD68. Lobectomy was performed on seven cases, wedge resection and segmentectomy were proceeded in two patients respectively. Follow up information showed no evidence of complication or recurrence.Solitary pulmonary capillary hemangioma has special imaging and various histological features and must be distinguished from small benign lung lesions and preinvasive cancer. Although the prognosis of this tumor is good after surgical resection, the correct interpretation of the gross appearance and radiographic findings are still important.

Our previous work has shown that Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a naturally occurring anti-inflammatory agent, found in propolis, has been found to be protective in experimental colitis via enhancement of epithelial barrier function. However, the impact of CAPE on resolution of fibrosis in the long-term is unknown.

A large number of studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs could take part in massive biological processes, such as transcriptional activation and interference, cellular differentiation, proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. The abnormal expression of lncRNAs has been clarified to play extremely important roles in various diseases, especially in human cancers. LncRNA actin filament-associated protein 1 antisense RNA 1 (AFAP1-AS1) is a newly recognized cancer-related lncRNA deriving from the antisense strand of DNA at the AFAP1 coding gene locus. A slew of new studies suggest that AFAP1-AS1 is involved in many kinds of malignant tumors. Moreover, in recent years, the dysregulated expression of AFAP1-AS1 has been confirmed to be associated with oncogenesis and tumor progression. Evidence has increasingly shown that AFAP1-AS1 could probably serve as a novel potential molecular biomarker in tumor diagnosis and therapeutic target in tumor treatment. In this review, we sum up present stage new hottest research issues in respect of the biological functions and molecular mechanisms of AFAP1-AS1 in occurrence and progression of human tumors.In this review, we summarize the recent researches about the expression and molecular biological mechanisms of lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 in tumor development. Existing relevant studies are acquired and analyzed by searching Pubmed, BioMedNet, GEO database and Academic Search Elit systematically.Long non-coding RNA AFAP1-AS1 is an important tumor-associated lncRNA and its aberrant expression has been found in many malignancies so far, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, retinoblastoma, laryngeal cancer, tongue squamous cell carcinoma and thyroid cancer. In addition, the dysregulated expression of AFAP1-AS1 is related to carcinogensis, overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), progression-free survival (PFS) and tumor progression containing lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, histological grade, tumor size and tumor stage.A series of studies provide detailed information to understand lncRNA AFAP1-AS1 role in various human cancers.

However, lack of tissue-specific lncRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) still exist. In this study, we identified a novel lncRNA LINC01939 which showed the largest fold change in GC than other human cancers from lnCAR database by bioinformatic analysis. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay confirmed that LINC01939 was significantly downregulated in GC tissues compared with matched normal tissues. Low expression of LINC01939 was positively associated with advanced TNM stage and lymphatic metastasis. Patients with low LINC01939 expression have remarkably shorter overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) than those with high LINC01939 expression. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that LINC01939 is an independent protective predictor of OS and PFS in GC patients. Therefore, our data suggest that the newly identified lncRNA LINC01939 might act as a potential prognostic biomarker for GC.",

Some of these lesions share the expression of CD34, posing differential diagnostic problems, especially in core biopsies. Recently, antibodies against the STAT6 C-terminal, are being used in paraffin-embedded tissues as a surrogate for identifying the NAB2\u2013STA6 fusion gene which is considered a specific molecular marker for solitary fibrous tumor. Accordingly, we investigated the expression of STAT6 in a large series of uncommon spindle cell tumor-like and tumor lesions occurring primarily in the breast parenchyma. We collected 10 classic-type myofibroblastomas, 9 desmoid-type fibromatosis, 6 spindle cell metaplastic carcinoma, 5 benign fibroblastic spindle cell tumors, 3 solitary fibrous tumors, 7 pseudoangiomatous stromal hyperplasias, 2 reactive spindle cell nodules, 1 leiomyoma, 1 spindle cell lipoma, 1 case of inflammatory pseudotumor, 1 nodular fasciitis, 1 myxoma and 1 dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. A diffuse and strong nuclear STAT6 expression was restricted only to solitary fibrous tumors, while the other lesions were negative or showed only weak cytoplasmic expression. The present study confirms that the demonstration of a diffuse and strong STAT6 nuclear staining is very helpful in distinguishing solitary fibrous tumor from other spindle cell mimics arising in the breast.",

     "abstract": "Numerous experimental studies and clinical observations suggest that cerebral ischemia may contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD). Two-vessel occlusion caused cerebral ischemia model is often used in the study of vascular dementia (VaD). But how cerebral ischemia works on AD rat model which induced by intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b21-42 remains unclear. In the following study, we investigated the characteristics of rat model caused by intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b21-42 or two-vessel occlusion (2-VO) only and by both of the two operations. The animal cognitive functions were accessed by the Morris water maze. Regional cerebral blood flow was detected by Laser Doppler Blood Flowmeter. HE&Nissl staining, Congo red staining and immunohistochemistry were used to observe the status of neuronal loss, A\u03b2 deposition and the phosphorylated tau expression in hippocampus, respectively. We also measured the contents of AchE and ChAT in serum and hippocampus by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay. The MWM results showed that rats of A\u03b21\u201342+2-VO group had a disorder in cognitive functions, at an early stage of one week after modeling, comparing with rats of sham group. The regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was significantly reduced in A\u03b21-42+2-VO and 2-VO group one week after modeling, and still maintained low perfusion levels four weeks after modeling. HE and Nissl staining showed that A\u03b21-42+2-VO rats\u2019 hippocampal CA1 neurons were in disorder, degeneration and necrosis, severe neuronal loss from the first week to the fourth week, while this phenomenon only appeared in the fourth week after modeling in rats of A\u03b21-42 group and 2-VO group. Congo red staining showed that A\u03b21-42 + 2-VO group rats\u2019 hippocampus CA1 had amyloid deposits from the first week to the fourth week, A\u03b21-42 group were not find amyloid deposition significantly until four weeks after modeling, however, 2-VO group had no significant amyloid deposition all the time. Notably, IHC showed that, two weeks after modeling, the p-tau positive total area and integrated optical density of hippocampal CA1 region were significantly increased in A\u03b21-42 + 2-VO group rats, while 2-VO group and A\u03b21-42 group rats had no significantly changes all the time. We also found that the content of AchE was increased both in serum and hippocampus of A\u03b21-42 + 2-VO group rats, and ChAT was decreased. However, there was no significantly change in cortex of content of AchE: acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and choline acetylase (ChAT) all three groups. Together, our study suggest that intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b21-42 combined with two-vessel occlusion may accelerate Alzheimer\u2019s disease development in rats. Also, this may serve as a less-time consuming new model to study the Alzheimer\u2019s disease and especially AD accompanied by cerebral ischemia.",

Galactose elevated thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBA-RS), protein carbonyl content and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity and decreased total sulfhydryl content and catalase (CAT) activity in the cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, galactose enhanced TBA-RS, decreased total sulfhydryl content and increased AChE activity, while in the cerebellum it decreased total sulfhydryl content and increased CAT and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities. Pretreatment with antioxidants prevented the majority of these alterations, indicating the participation of free radicals in these effects. Thus, intracerebroventricular galactose infusion impairs redox homeostasis in the brain; the administration of antioxidants should be considered as an adjuvant therapy to specific diets in galactosemia.",

However, there are few studies regarding TROP2 in relation to both oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral potentially malignant lesions. The expression of TROP2 protein and mRNA was investigated in OSCC tissues, oral potentially malignant lesion tissues, and normal oral tissues using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The association between TROP2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC was also analyzed, and the prognostic value of TROP2 was evaluated. The expression of TROP2 protein and mRNA were both higher in OSCC tissues than in oral potentially malignant lesion tissues or normal oral tissues. Positive TROP2 expression was related to differentiation, lymph node metastases, TNM stage, perineural infiltration, and vascular invasion. Poor overall survival was associated with high TROP2 expression and other factors associated with poor overall survival including poor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, TNM stage, vascular invasion, and perineural invasion in univariate analyses. TROP2 expression as well as TNM stage and vascular invasion were independent prognostic factors associated with the overall survival of OSCC patients in multivariate analyses. In summary, High TROP2 expression is associated with poor overall survival and serves as an independent prognostic factor in OSCC. The results suggest that TROP2 expression could be an effective prognostic biomarker for OSCC.",

We found that UQCRC2 was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and immunohistochemical UQCRC2 status was correlated to the depth of invasion (T), lymph node metastasis (N), advanced TNM stage.

The effects of UQCRC2 knockdown on CRC cells (RKO and HCT116) proliferation were analyzed by cell proliferation and colony formation assay, and cell cycle and apoptosis were assessed by flow cytometry. We found that silencing UQCRC2 suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation in RKO and HCT116 cells, led to a cell cycle arrest and induced cell apoptosis in vitro. These results provided novel insights into the potential role of UQCRC2 in the tumorigenesis and progression of CRC, and revealed that UQCRC2 may serve as a new prognostic and therapeutic target in CRC.",

In the present study, we investigated the role of Nek6 in breast tumorigenesis and the prognostic merit of Nek6 expression in breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses was conducted to determine the expression profile of Nek6 in 133 breast cancer specimens. Nek6 was overexpressed in a majority of breast cancer specimens, compared with the adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Furthermore, we revealed that high expression of Nek6 was associated with histologic grade, tumor size and TNM stage in breast cancer. Liner regression analysis showed a significant association between the levels of Nek6 and Ki-67. Cox regression analysis indicated that Nek6 expression was an independent prognostic predictor for breast cancer. Moreover, intracellular level of Nek6 was remarkably increased following the release from serum starvation in MCF-7 cells. EdU incorporation assay indicated that depletion of Nek6 remarkably impaired the proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Finally, spheroid formation assay revealed that interference of Nek6 led to diminished oncospheroid-forming capacity of breast cancer cells. In conclusion, our results imply that Nek6 plays a facilitating role in breast cancer cell proliferation and may serve as a promising therapeutic target for breast cancer.",

The relationship between miR-130b expression and clinicopathological features, postoperative recurrence and survival rate were analyzed.The liver function of PHC patients was improved after RFA treatment. The level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) was gradually reduced on POD 7 and POD 14 (all P\u2009<\u2009 0.05). Before RFA, the expression of miR-130b in PHC patients was upregulated, while the expression of miR-130b decreased significantly with time after RFA treatment. And high expression of miR-130b was closely related to cirrhosis (P\u2009=\u2009 0.027) and tumor differentiation degree (P\u2009<\u2009 0.01). Serum miR-130b levels were significantly higher in patients with recurrence than in patients without recurrence (P\u2009<\u2009 0.05). Patients were divided into two groups according to miR-130b expression level (median \u0394Ct), compared with low \u0394Ct group, the incidence of recurrence in high \u0394Ct group was significantly higher after RFA (P\u2009=\u2009 0.020).

     "abstract": "Hepatic steatosis is common in patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). Particularly in patients infected with non-genotype 3 HCV, hepatic steatosis is closely related to factors of the metabolic syndrome such as hyperlipidemia. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in this \u201cmetabolic\u201d steatosis in non-3 genotype HCV infections are not well understood. Here, we aimed to develop an in vitro model to study the effect of genotype 1 HCV infection on hepatic lipotoxicity and lipid metabolism. Cellular lipid accumulation was induced in Huh-7 hepatoma cells transfected with HCV genotype 1b replicon (HCV+) by incubation with increasing doses of palmitic acid (C16:0) or oleic acid (C18:1 n-9) complexed to albumin mimicking hyperlipidemic conditions. Mock transfected hepatoma cells (HCV\u2212) were used as controls. Incubation with oleic acid concentrations as high as 0.5\u202fmM did not induce toxic effects in HCV+ or HCV\u2212 cells. In contrast, incubation with palmitic acid caused dose-dependently cytotoxic effects which were more pronounced in HCV+ compared to HCV\u2212 cells. Further analysis with subtoxic palmitic and oleic acid concentrations revealed a higher uptake of fatty acids and intracellular triglyceride accumulation in HCV+ compared to HCV\u2212 cells. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) expression, indicative of mitochondrial beta-oxidation, was markedly stimulated by lipid exposure in HCV+ but not in HCV\u2212 cells. Furthermore, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1) expression levels increased in FA stimulated cells, and this increase was significantly higher in HCV+ compared to HCV\u2212 cells. In contrast, expression of the key enzymes of hepatic de novo lipogenesis fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD-1) was significantly reduced upon oleate exposure in HCV\u2212 but not in HCV+ cells.In summary, our newly developed cell culture model revealed effects of HCV genotype 1b infection on metabolic susceptibility to lipid accumulation and toxicity particularly to saturated lipids. These results may indicate that HCV (genotype 1b) infected individuals with hyperlipidemia may benefit from dietary or pharmacological intervention.",

The experiment lasted for 4 weeks, during which mice conditions, diet and defecation were monitored on a daily basis. Body weight, as well as tumor diameters, which were assessed using standard caliper method, were measured once a week. In vivo imaging was performed to detect the activity of transplanted tumors. H&E staining was used to analyze the histological structure of tumor tissues in three groups, while flow cytometry and fluorescent RT-PCR were performed to measure cell proliferation and the expression of ANXA3 mRNA. Briefly, significantly slower tumor growth and tumor activity were observed in the transfection group compared to negative and blank controls, while the tumor weight and volume in this group were also significantly lower compared to the other two groups (P < 0.01). Sparse tumor cells accompanied with massive fibrous connective tissue proliferation, and lower new blood vessels formation were observed in transfection group compared to other groups. Moreover, mRNA and protein levels of ANXA3 were significantly lower in transfection group compared to the other two groups (P < 0.01). In addition, lower proliferation index and higher G0/1 cell count were observed in transfection group compared to negative and blank controls (P < 0.01). To sum up, these results suggested that ANXA3 silencing regulates the proliferation and inhibits the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Consequently, ANXA3 might be used as a potential target for gene therapy in breast cancer.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant expression of CD3 on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is rare, and its mechanism and biological significance are currently unclear. Herein we report a case of Epstein-Barr virus-negative, CD3-positive DLBCL in a 53\u202fyear-old male, who had a remote history of renal transplantation. After standard chemotherapy, the patient was in clinical remission. He relapsed three years later, but at this time with apparent loss of CD3 expression. PCR-based IGK gene rearrangement studies demonstrated clonal amplicons with an identical nucleotide size between the primary and secondary DLBCL, confirming the clonal relationship despite their phenotypic differences. To our knowledge, this is the first case of CD3-positive DLBCL that demonstrated a loss of aberrant CD3 on relapse. The chronologic change in phenotype seen in this case suggests that the source of the patient\u2019s lymphoma relapse may arise from either a quiescent subclone without CD3 expression, or from an upstream neoplastic precursor cell.",

     "abstract": "Differently from other digestive malignancies, gastric cancer (GC) carcinogenesis seems more heterogeneous and unclear. This entails failing in identification of reliable serum tumor markers for screening early GC (EGC) as well as persisting ominous prognosis of this disease. Recently, investigation of human noncoding genome, especially long noncoding molecules (lncRNAs), has provided promising data. As for GC, however, since the current information on GC-specific lncRNAs is still scarce and comes largely from analyses performed on tissue or serum of affected patients, we decided to review the current literature dealing with expression of such molecules in the gastric juice (GJ) of GC patients. In the case of GC, in fact, several cytological and molecular works have already demonstrated GJ to be an interesting biological material for improving clinicopathologic and prognostic knowledge of this cancer.For this review, we burrowed into the literature on lncRNAs expressed in GJ of GC patients. PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, Web of Science, Google Scholar and ResearchGate were the search engines entertained. As of 2018, only seven studies have been reported. LINC00152, AA174084, UCA1, RMRP, ABHD11-AS1, LINC00982 and H19 were the GJ lncRNAs examined.Following our review, we can conclude that, due to their high specificity and reliability, GJ lncRNAs should deserve a prominent role in the field of GC research: importantly, they could be used for screening EGC, ameliorating the existing methods of staging (which are still far from being completely accurate), improving the prognostic capacity of the current diagnostic armamentarium and, finally, providing new and valuable therapeutic targets.",

     "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), a group of transcripts with length greater than 200 nucleotides, have been involved in multiple pathophysiological processes of the human body, especially in tumorigenesis and progression of cancers. The aberrant expression of lncRNAs processes crucial functions involved in proliferation, apoptosis and metastatic capacity of cancers. Recent studies have revealed that small nucleolar RNA host gene 1 (SNHG1), a long non-coding RNA transcribed from UHG, was located in chromosome 11. Aberrant expression of SNHG1 has been demonstrated to be associated with various sites of cancers such as glioma, esophageal cancer, gastric cancer and many others, and its deregulation could be related to survival and prognosis of cancer patients. Pertinent to clinical practice, SNHG1 might act as a prognostic biomarker for tumors and might even serve as potential target for therapy. In this review, we summarized current researches concerning the role of SNHG1 in tumor progression and discussed its mechanisms involved.In this review, we summarized and figured out recent studies concerning the expression and biological mechanisms of SNHG1in tumor development. The related studies were obtained through a systematic search of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library.SNHG1 was a valuable cancer-related lncRNA that the expression level was up-regulation in a variety of malignancies, including glioma, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, prostate cancer, cervical cancer, osteosarcoma, neuroblastoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aberrant expressions of SNHG1 have shown to contribute to proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells.SNHG1 represents promising novel biomarkers for various cancer types and have a great potential to be effectively used in clinical practice in the near future.",

No significant prognostic value was found with AIB1 and HER2 CNG in male patients. However, linear regression analysis showed a positive relationship between the copy number of AIB1 and HER2 (P < 0.01) in male patients, rather than female patients.In this study, we reveal a gender difference in the prognostic value of concomitant AIB1 and HER2 CNG in glioma patients which were barely noticed before.

However, none of these findings completely interpreted the role of UCA1 in HCC. We conducted this investigation to validate the expression of UCA1 and its relationship with Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage in 41 HCC tissues and their paired noncancerous adjacent tissues by real-time qPCR. Furthermore, we also explored the biological functions of UCA1 in vitro with HCC cell lines. Most importantly, we conducted a comprehensive meta-analysis and bioinformatics investigation based on peer-reviewed literature and in silico approaches to further summarise the clinical value and functions of UCA1 in HCC. UCA1 expression was remarkably upregulated in HCC tissues, and its expression was profoundly higher in advanced stages than in early stages. Reducing the expression levels of UCA1 suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis of HCC cells. Furthermore, the present meta-analysis validated that up-regulated UCA1 was closely related to larger tumour size and advanced TNM stages, and the overexpression of UCA1 was significantly correlated with a shorter OS. Additionally, according to GO analysis, the target genes were found concentrated in the following biological processes: extracellular matrix organisation, cilium assembly and cilium morphogenesis. KEGG pathway analysis showed that the UCA1-related genes were significantly enriched in the following pathways: hippo signalling pathway, bile secretion and gastric acid secretion. This evidence hinted that UCA1 could play an indispensable proliferation-related key role in HCC via the hippo signalling pathway. However, the exact molecular mechanism needs to be verified with future functional experiments.",

     "abstract": "Tumor budding is an independent prognostic factor in colorectal cancer. However, varying degrees of interobserver agreement and reproducibility challenges the use of tumor budding in diagnostics. Immunohistochemical staining of tumor slides with pan-cytokeratin visualizes the budding tumor cells and has been suggested to improve reproducibility. Here we demonstrate the methodology of tumor budding assessment using digital image analysis based on tumor slides stained for pan-cytokeratin, and investigate interobserver agreement, agreement between manual and digital assessment methods and digital reproducibility between users.Tumor slides from 126 patients with pT1/pT2 colorectal cancer were stained with pan-cytokeratin and tumor budding at the invasive tumor front was assessed by conventional manual microscopy. A digital image analysis algorithm for identification and quantification of budding tumor cells was developed and tested on the pan-cytokeratin stained slides.Manual assessment of tumor budding using pan-cytokeratin stained tumor slides exhibited high correlations (Spearman Rank 0.84-0.89, p\u202f<\u202f0.001),excellent agreement between observers (Intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC): 0.86 -0.87) and 2.20 higher odds for regional metastases with increasing budding counts (p\u202f=\u202f0.017). Digital image analysis correlated well to manual assessment (Spearman Rank 0.71-0.88) and agreement between the two methods was good (ICC 0.62-0.82). However, only a trend towards increased odds for metastatic progression was found for the adjusted digital estimates (p\u202f=\u202f0.076). Digital estimates were higher than manual estimates, demonstrated by a systematic median difference of 3\u20134.5 buds. Image analysis was highly reproducible between users of the algorithm (ICC 0.98). In conclusion, assessment of tumor budding using pan-cytokeratin stained tumor slides is a method with high correlation and agreement between observers. Digital image analysis quantifies budding tumor cells in high agreement with manual estimates, but approval of the digital slides by a pathologist is mandatory. The method qualifies for further investigation.",

PF is characterized by abnormal proliferation of fibroblast, dysregulated fibroblast differentiation to myofibroblast and disorganized collagen and extracellular matrix (ECM) production, deposition and degradation. JAG1/Notch signaling has been reported to play a key role in tissue fibrosis including PF. Herein, we confirmed the abnormal upregulation of JAG1 mRNA expression and protein levels in PF tissue specimens; JAG1 knockdown reduced TGF-\u03b21-induced \u03b1-SMA and Collagen I protein levels. From the aspect of miRNA regulation, we searched for candidate miRNAs which might target JAG1 to inhibit its expression. Among the selected miRNAs, miR-30d expression was downregulated in PF tissues; miR-30d overexpression attenuated TGF-\u03b21-induced primary normal human lung fibroblast (NHLF) proliferation, as well as \u03b1-SMA and Collagen I protein levels. Through directly binding to the 3\u2032-UTR of JAG1, miR-30d significantly inhibited JAG1 mRNA expression and protein level. Furthermore, JAG1 overexpression partially reversed the effect of miR-30d on NHLF proliferation and \u03b1-SMA and Collagen I proteins upon TGF-\u03b21 stimulation; miR-30d could suppress TGF-\u03b21 function on NHLFs through blocking JAG1/Notch signaling.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a high level of glucose on RhoA and eNOS activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells(HUVECs) and how Schisandrin plays a role in mediating these effects. To find the optimal treatment time, HUVECs were cultured at a high glucose concentration (30\u202fmM) for different lengths of time (0, 12, 24, and 48\u202fh). Subsequently, the cells were randomized into five groups: a normal group, a high glucose group, and three high glucose groups that were given different doses (5, 10, and 20\u202f\u03bcM) of Schisandrin. The cells were pretreated with Schisandrin for 24\u202fh before stimulation with high glucose. The morphology of HUVECs in the various groups was assessed under a light microscope. Immunocytochemical staining was used to detect the level of p-MYPT1 expression. The levels of RhoA activity were determined using the RhoA Activation Assay Biochem Kit. The levels of eNOS activity were examined using a nitrate reduction test. The results showed that in the high glucose group, the activity of RhoA was increased and the activity of eNOS was reduced, thus decreasing the secretion of NO. However, after pretreatment with Schisandrin (10, 20\u202f\u03bcM), the activity of RhoA was inhibited and the activity of eNOS increased, which led to an increase in NO production compared with the high glucose group. There was no evident difference between the 5\u202f\u03bcM Schisandrin group and the high glucose group. Taken together, these findings indicate that Schisandrin can improve the function of endothelial cells by lowering the activity of RhoA/Rho kinase and raising both the activity of eNOS and the production of NO.",

Treatment with miR-223-3p mimic inhibits cell proliferation and migration via decreasing several inflammation-associated cytokines, including interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-8 and IL-18. Importantly, these effects induced by miR-223-3p could be attenuated by NLRP3 overexpression, which was considered as one of target genes of miR-223-3p. In conclusion, these results indicated that miR-223-3p might act as a suppressor and a potential therapy target of GBM.",

Specimens of ovarian carcinoma tissue and adjacent tissue were collected from 20 ovarian carcinoma patients. Human THP-1 cells were induced to differentiate into macrophages, which were then co-cultured with SKOV3 cells and low concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) to simulate the inflammatory microenvironment of ovarian carcinoma. Additionally, small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CXCR6 was transfected into SKOV3 cells; after which, the levels of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-\u03baB p65) protein and phosphorylated PI3K and Akt were measured. The migration and invasion abilities of the SKOV3 cells were also tested. The levels of TNF-\u03b1, interluekin-6 (IL-6), NF-\u03baB p65, CXCL16, and CXCR6 expression in the ovarian carcinoma tissues were higher than those in the precancerous tissues. CXCR6 expression was positively correlated with TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and CXCL16 expression. Co-culture of SKOV3 cells with macrophages significantly promoted CXCL16, CXCR6, NF-\u03baB, and p65 expression by the SKOV3 cells, increased their levels of phosphorylated PI3K and Akt, and increased the migration and invasion abilities of SKOV3 cells. Silencing of CXCR6 or blocking the PI3K/Akt signal pathway markedly attenuated the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and phosphorylation of PI3K and Akt, as well as the migration and invasion abilities of SKOV3 cells. These findings demonstrate that macrophages can promote the migration and invasion of ovarian carcinoma cells by affecting the CXCL16/CXCR6 pathway.",

The expression level of Acer3 in human HCC cell lines were examined by western blot. Overall survival and disease-free survival of HCC patients were determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Effects of Acer3 knockdown by lentivirus infection were evaluated on cell growth and apoptosis. The mechanisms involved in HCC cells growth and apoptosis were analyzed by western blot.In silico analysis of TCGA databases of HCC patients showed that the expression of Acer3 significantly inversely correlates with the overall and disease-free survival of HCC patients. Knockdown expression of Acer3 resulted in decreased cell growth and increased apoptosis. Notably, inhibition of Acer3 resulted in intracellular exhaustion of Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) and inhibited activation of S1PR2/PI3K/AKT signaling. Finally, knockdown of Acer3 induced up-regulation of Bax and down-regulation of Bcl-2.Our study suggests that Acer3 contributes to HCC propagation, and suggests that inhibition of Acer3 may be novel strategy for treating human HCC.",

Functionally, MTT assay and Flow cytometry were conducted to explore the functions of miR-26b-5p in cells proliferation and apoptosis. Furthermore, bioinformatics tools, Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis, gain-and loss of-function experiments and rescue experiment were used to determine the relationship between JAG1 and miR-26b-5p in MM cells. In addition, we also confirmed the role of JAG1 in MM cells proliferation and apoptosis by gain-and loss of-function experiments.Here, we reported for the first time that miR-26b-5p was under-expressed in MM by real-time PCR. Clinically, Kaplan-Meier Curves showed that MM patients with lower miR-26b-5p expression had worse prognosis. Functionally, MTT assay revealed that miR-26b-5p inhibited cells proliferation. Flow cytometry indicated that miR-26b-5p accelerated tumor cells apoptosis.

The PI3K-Akt pathway was one of the most important dysregulated pathways in bronchial epithelial cells. We further identified that 3 genes involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, including IL6, F2R, and FGFR3, might be associated with inhibition of cell proliferation in bronchial epithelial cells, while 5 genes involved in the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, including TLR4, IL6, F2R, FGFR3, and FGFR1, might be associated with apoptosis of bronchial epithelial cells.

We observed altered expression of apoptosis and cell proliferation-related genes that might contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of TUSC3 in CRC tissues, and to evaluate the clinical pathological characters and prognostic significance.First, we performed a bioinformatics analysis by using Oncomine and COEXPEDIA databases. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was performed using TCGA data set. Then, the protein expression level of TUSC3 was detected by immunohistochemistry in 230 pairs of primary colorectal cancer and corresponding non-tumor tissues.We investigated Oncomine databases and found that TUSC3 mRNA expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues compared with normal tissues. The immunohistochemistry results demonstrated that TUSC3 was overexpressed in the CRC tissues. Furthermore, TUSC3 overexpression was associated with T stage, lymph node metastasis, and distant metastasis. TUSC3 overexpression was associated with worse overall survival for CRC, and retained significance as an independent prognostic factor for CRC. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that TUSC3 expression was associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition signaling pathway and TUSC3 co-expression genes were obtained from COEXPEDIA.TUSC3 may act as an oncogene in the progression of colorectal cancer. Moreover, TUSC3 has potential to be used as prognostic markers or therapeutic targets in CRC.",

A 27-year-old Japanese male without any prior disease history complained of pain in his right hip joint and right lower limb. Radiological images revealed an osteolytic and multicystic lesion existing mainly at the proximal epiphysis of the right femur. Preoperative clinical diagnosis was GCTB, although irregular marginal sclerosis was an atypical radiographic finding for conventional GCTBs. Biopsy sample from the lesion revealed the coexistence of typical GCTB and undifferentiated high-grade round cell sarcoma. Despite of the wide local resection of the tumor with preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, the patient died of multiple distant metastases of the tumor 9 months after the surgery. Since heterozygous H3F3A c. 103G>T (p. Gly34Trp) mutation was detected not only in the biopsy sample from the primary site with typical GCTB and high-grade sarcoma components but also in the resected material from the metastatic site with only pure high-grade sarcoma component, the tumor was considered originally derived from conventional GCTB and acquire malignant transformation to high-grade sarcoma. Thus, this is an extremely rare case of primary malignancy in GCTB and the first case report of primary malignancy in GCTB proved the presence of H3F3A mutation even in the sarcoma component.",

Three distinct sets of molecular events characterize metastasis, viz invasion of extracellular matrix; angiogenesis, vascular dissemination and anoikis resistance; tumor homing and relocation of tumor cells to selective organ. Invasion of extracellular matrix requires epithelial to mesenchymal transition through disrupted lamellopodia formation and contraction of actin cytoskeleton; aberration of Focal adhesion complex formation involving integrins and the extracellular matrix; degradation of extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteases; faulty immune surveillance in tumor microenvironment and an upregulated proton efflux pump NHE1 in tumors. Vascular dissemination and anoikis resistance depend upon upregulation of integrins, phosphorylation of CDCP1, attenuated apoptotic pathways and upregulation of angiogenesis. Tumor homing depends on recruitment of mesenchymal stem cells, expression on chemokines and growth factors, upregulated stem cell renewal pathways. Despite of many potential challenges in curbing metastasis, future targeted therapies involving immunotherapy, stem cell engineered and oncolytic virus based therapy, pharmacological activation of circadian clock are held promising. To sum up, metastasis is a complex cascade of events and warrants detailed molecular understanding for development of therapeutic strategies.",

But, the prognostic values of TINs, TILs and NLR (neutrophils-lymphocytes ratio) in bladder cancer (BC) are still undefined. The object of our study was to systematically interrogate the associations of these immune cells with clinical outcomes of BC patients. In our study, a total of 102 patients pathologically diagnosed with BC were included. CD66b+ and CD8+ antibodies were used to mark neutrophils and CD8+ lymphocytes by immunohistochemistry. The results found that TINs and NLR were significantly associated with pathological T-stages of tumors (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), but TILs were not. And TINs were also related to pathological tumor grades (P\u202f=\u202f0.012). Regarding the prognostic values, TINs was related to the high risk of recurrence in non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) patients. Elevated TINs and NLR were associated with poor overall survivals of BC patients, whereas higher TILs were related to longer survivals (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that both of TINs (HR 2.427, 1.024-5.752, P\u202f=\u202f0.044) and NLR (HR 3.529, 1.147-10.864, P\u202f=\u202f0.028) were independent unfavorable prognosis markers.

Patient selection for such therapy relies upon the immunohistochemical detection of PD-1/PD-L1, however the degree of ITH for these markers among tumor cells and/or inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates remains unknown. Therefore, we analyzed PD-L1 (SP-142) expression in the tumor inflammatory cells of 22 CCRCC cases with the aim to define the pattern of PD-L1 expression, and to compare the reliability of current tumor sampling protocols (RS) with a multisite tumor sampling strategy (MSTS). While the RS protocol identified 5/22 (22.7%) of cases that were positive for PD-L1 expression, MSTS identified 10/22 (45.45%) of cases.

     "abstract": "Microvessel density is an indicator of tumor-driven neoangiogenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have distinct vascular patterns, which are also reflected in their imaging characteristics. Since a significant proportion of HCC are treated without biopsy confirmation, it is essential to discriminate HCC and ICC radiologically. The aim of our study was therefore to compare microvessel density and expression of VEGFR-2 in HCC and ICC, since these data may ultimately help us to better understand their imaging characteristics. Whereas CD31 documents vessel density, VEGFR-2 expression is an indicator of tumor-related neoangiogenesis.CD31 and VEGFR-2 expressing microvessels were quantified on tissue microarrays of 95 resection specimens of HCC and 47 cases of ICC. Microvessel density was evaluated by counting immuno-reactive vascular structures both within the tumor and adjacent liver control tissue, respectively. Further 16 cases of ICC were immunostained for CD31 and VEGFR-2 on full sections.The frequency of VEGFR-2 (46.2/HPF; range 0\u2013150) and CD31 (61.2/HPF; range 2.6\u2013140) expressing vascular structures was significantly increased in HCC compared to adjacent liver parenchyma (VEGFR-2 33.3/HPF, range 0\u201387, CD31 21.4/HPF, range 0\u201378, both p\u202f<\u202f0,001). ICC revealed significantly less VEGFR2-positive microvessels (15.4/HPF; range 2\u201377) compared to matched control tissue (42.3/HPF; range 4.6\u2013109), whereas microvessel density with CD31 was comparable between ICC and adjacent liver (32.1/HPF; range 5.3\u201378 versus 28.0/HPF; range 5.3\u201357; p\u202f=\u202f0.89).In ICC, the tumor-to-normal microvessel density ratio was 0.38 for VEGFR-2 and 1.24 for CD31. These ratios were nearly identical (VEGFR: 0.38; CD31: 0,97) for the 16 cases of ICC studied on whole sections, confirming the validity of the TMA approach. In contrast, ratios of VEGFR-2 and CD31 in HCC vs. adjacent liver were significantly higher (VEGFR: 2.23; CD31: 6.57). Expression of VEGFR-2 by tumor cells was not observed in any of the cases.HCC and ICC differ significantly in their microvessel density, confirming the hypovascular nature of ICC as compared to the hypervascularity of HCC. Of note, inverse tumor-to-normal ratios of microvascular VEGFR-2 expression between the two neoplasms indicate distinct features of neoangiogenesis. Whether these differences can be exploited for improvements in imaging of hepatic tumors and may play a role for anti-angiogenic treatment strategies requires further studies.",

We performed a meta-analysis to clarify if a correlation exists between MPO polymorphism and the risk for developing cervical cancer.All case-control research studies that determined a relationship between MPO and cervical cancer reported up until March 1, 2018 in PubMed, Web of Science, VIP, WanFang, and the CNKI Database were accessed and included. The strength of association was evaluated with pooled odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). We used sensitivity analysis to detect the stability of our results, conducted Q-test to evaluate heterogeneity and applied Begg\u2019s funnel plot and Egger\u2019s test to investigate any publication bias among selected studies.In this meta-analysis, we included 5 eligible studies in the final evaluation, which included 1125 patients with cervical cancer and 1150 cancer-free control patients. A potential association between the MPO \u2212463 G\u202f>\u202fA polymorphism and cervical cancer risk was observed (recessive model: OR\u202f=\u202f0.65, 95%, CI: 0.43\u20130.98, P\u202f=\u202f0.038; homozygous model: OR\u202f=\u202f0.65, 95%, CI: 0.43\u20130.99, P\u202f=\u202f0.045), which indicates that genotype AA reduces the risk of cervical cancer by 35% compared to GG/GA or GG genotypes in our results. A stratified analysis by ethnicity identified a significant correlation among Caucasian patients (recessive model: OR\u202f=\u202f0.57, 95%, CI: 0.34\u20130.95, P\u202f=\u202f0.029; homozygous model: OR\u202f=\u202f0.60, 95%, CI: 0.36\u20130.99, P\u202f=\u202f0.048) and a stratified analysis by source of control identified a significant correlation among population-based studies.Our results suggest that the presence of polymorphism, \u2212463 G\u202f>\u202fA in patients might offer them protection against cervical cancer. By implementing randomized case-control or cohort studies with larger sample sizes, the clinical significance of our results can be further strengthened and verified.",

     "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is one of the pathogenic factors responsible for intestinal injury in Ulcerative colitis (UC). Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) plays a critical role against ROS factors to conserve epithelial integrity. This study aimed to localize Nrf2 and IL-17A protein in the inflamed mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis. The gene expression of Nrf2 was also correlated with GST-A4 and PRDX1.A total of 20 patients and 20 healthy controls with definite UC based on the clinical criteria were enrolled for this study. The expression pattern of Nrf2 and IL-17A protein was compared in inflamed and non-inflamed colonic biopsies by immunohistochemical staining. Nrf2, GST-A4 and PRDX1 gene expression were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).In inflamed colonic biopsies, an increased level of Nrf2 protein factor was detected in epithelial cells. Conversely, IL-17A protein was presented more in mononuclear cells in mucosa and lamina propria regions. A significant increase of Nrf2, GST-A4 gene expression was observed in both mild and severe patients with ulcerative colitis. GST-A4 gene expression indicated a high exponential rate in logistic regression.Oxidative stress in inflamed colonic tissue can induce Nrf2 gene expression. The performance of Nrf2 transcription factor may lead to the induction of GST-A4 and PRDX1. IL-17A is less detected in intestinal in\ufb02ammation, presenting Nrf2 factor. The present findings suggest that Nrf2 function in the gut plays a role in arresting both inflammatory response and oxidative damages of UC.",

Seventeen such cases underwent molecular genetic analysis, using either the patient\u2019s peripheral blood in 9 cases or paraffin embedded tumor tissue in the rest. VHL gene mutations were documented in 3/9 cases in which DNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes was used, all with clinically manifest von Hippel-Lindau disease; instead, no VHL gene alterations were found in all of the 8 cases with sporadic extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma in which DNA from tumor tissue was analyzed. Our aim is to investigate the molecular genetic profile of the VHL gene in extraneuraxial hemangioblastoma using paraffin embedded tumor tissues.The clinical features, histopathology, and molecular investigations of 10 extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas (7 females, 3 males; median age: 47 years) are presented herein. The histopathologic diagnosis was supported by immunohistochemistry (10/10) and electron microscopy (4/10). Molecular genetic analysis was conducted (10/10) for VHL gene mutations, LOH, and gene promoter methylation. Two of the present cases were already published with only limited or no molecular investigations.Four tumors of the present series were paraneuraxial, and 6 peripheral (2 involved soft tissues, and 4 the kidney). One tumor was von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated, 1 was classified as \u201chemangioblastoma-only VHLD\u201d, 7 were sporadic, and one was unknown. All were histopathologically analogous to their counterpart located inside the central nervous system. Immunophenotypically, all tumors expressed vimentin, S-100, NSE, and alpha-inhibin (10/10). Ultrastructurally, unbound lipid droplets filled the cytoplasms of the stromal cells. Molecular analysis revealed 3 inactivating mutations (1 germline, two somatic) in the coding sequence of the VHL gene in 2 different extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas, and LOH in 4 (two as a double hit), all non-renal extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas. Methylation analysis failed to disclose promoter methylation in any case.In conclusion, we report eight new cases from the wide category of extraneuraxial hemangioblastomas (4 paraneuraxial, and 4 renal), one of which was von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated and 7 sporadic. VHL gene alterations were found not only in the von Hippel-Lindau disease-associated tumor, but \u2212 for the first time \u2212 also in 3 sporadic ones, two of which with novel mutations.",

So we should explore the relevance between molecular subtypes and efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer as well as its prognostic factors, which about survival analysis and disease free survival involved, which was one part of contributing for evaluating in terms of global survival and disease free survival.Medical records of 264 patients with breast cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Breast Center, the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University, between January 2008 and May 2013. The relationship between molecular subtypes and neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and clinical pathological features were analyzed.The total pCR rate was 12.50% (33/264). The rate of pCR were 3.03% (1/33), 9.40% (14/149), 17.39%(8/46), 27.78% (10/36) in Luminal A type, Luminal B type, HER2 overexpression type, and Triple negative type, respectively. Which was predicted that The pCR rate associated with breast cancer molecular subtypes (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The pCR rate in Triple negative type was highest, HER2 overexpression type was showed higher pCR rate than Luminal A and Luminal B type. Multiple factors analysis results showed that: the independent impact factors of 5-year overall survival rate in neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer patients were clinical stage, tumor size, chemotherapy regimens, lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor status and pathological remission; the independent impact factors of 5-year disease free survival rate were tumor size, chemotherapy regimens, estrogen receptor status, progesterone receptor status and pathological remission (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Triple negative type of breast cancer had shorter overall survival and disease-free survival (P\u202f<\u202f0.05).The pCR was more frequently observed in HER2 overexpression type and Triple negative type of breast cancer. That could achieve a higher rate of pCR on paclitaxel class joint anthracycline-based chemotherapy. But Triple negative type showed worse prognosis, due to residual tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which could be in combination or sequential, at the neoadjuvant / adjuvant setting (NCCN 2016 Breast cancer, chemotherapy regimens), So how to choose a more appropriate neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, we should need further research.",

We examined the Arg1-positive cells in tumor microenvironment of gastric carcinomas (GCs), colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and prostate carcinomas (PCs), and analyzed their clinicopathological significance. Immunohistochemical staining for Arg1 was done in 60 GCs, 38 gastric adenomas, 40 CRCs, 10 colonic adenomas, 36 PCs, and 15 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Arg1 expression was predominantly localized in tumor microenvironment and the stroma of nonneoplastic tissues. Cells with Arg1 expression were mostly leukocytes, morphologically resembling polymorphonuclear neutrophils, and showed CD15 expression. Arg1 expression was focally expressed in cancer cells of 6 PCs, but not in those of GCs and CRCs. Arg1-positive cells were significantly more infiltrated in tumors than adenomas and nonneoplastic tissues, such as BPH, intestinal metaplasia and adjacent tissues. There were no significant findings between them and clinicopathological parameters, except for the relationship to gender and tumor differentiation in CRCs. These findings suggest that Arg1-positive cells in tumor microenvironment is involved in the occurrence of GCs, CRCs, and PCs.

Additionally, SNAIL and E-cadherin transcripts were evaluated in vitro by qPCR, using SCC-9 cell line in comparison to human keratinocytes (HPEC). There was a significant increase in nuclear expression of SNAIL from NOM to OLD followed by a noticeable decrease in nuclear expression accompanied by increased cytoplasmic expression in OSCC (p<0.05). The E-cadherin cytoplasmic expression was remarkable and statistically significant higher in OSCC and LN, both compared to NOM (p< 0.0001), OL (p<0.01) and OLD (p< 0.0001 and p<0.001, respectively). In vitro, E-cadherin and SNAIL transcripts were lower in SCC-9 compared to HPEC cells, although only the decrease of E-cadherin was statistically significant (p<0.05). Regarding the association of E-cadherin and SNAIL expression with the clinical findings, the analysis revealed an association between the cytoplasmic expression of SNAIL and the invasion pattern (p=0.05) in OSCC. The increased nuclear SNAIL expression may be characteristic of OLD, and the presence of E-cadherin in cell cytoplasm a marker of transformation to malignancy of potentially malignant oral leukoplakias into OSCC.",

Tissues of 90 patients with OSCC from the School of Stomatology, China Medical University were collected, and immunohistochemical staining and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed for MIF and CD74. The possible correlations between MIF and CD74 and clinical characteristics were analysed. The Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine the survival rates of patients. In addition, the proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells were evaluated after transfection with siRNA against MIF. MIF and CD74 levels were significantly higher in tissues of patients with OSCC than in control tissues. Moreover, MIF levels in patients with OSCC were significantly associated with cell differentiation and TNM classification. MIF expression was closely related to CD74 expression. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that OSCC patients with high MIF levels showed reduced overall survival and recurrenc-free survival. Furthermore, MIF expression promoted proliferation and invasion of OSCC cells. Collectively, our results reveal that MIF expression is a significant independent prognostic factor for patients with OSCC and may be a novel prognostic marker for OSCC.",

The mechanisms responsible for cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary inflammation remain unclear, and thus lack of effective treatment. The present study investigated the effect of calpeptin on attenuating cigarette smoke induced pulmonary inflammation and its potential mechanism and function. When BALB/c mice were exposed to cigarette smoke and received calpeptin intraperitoneally injection after 90 days, calpeptin histologically attenuated the accumulation of neutrophils (P\u202f<\u202f0.001), eosinophils (P\u202f<\u202f0.001), macrophages (P\u202f<\u202f0.01), fibrinous exudation and proliferation within the interstitial and alveolar spaces.

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 expression in both protein and mRNA levels were detected. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) technique was employed to knockdown MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression. Additionally, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) inhibitors were applied to assess the potential signaling pathways involved in the effects of IL-1\u03b2 on cell migration.IL-1\u03b2 promoted cell migration of OENSCs in a concentration-dependent manner at the concentration range of 0\u201380\u202fng/ml, but did not affect cell proliferation and apoptosis.

For three cases, we also performed EGFR FISH for analyzing EGFR copy number.In Case 2 and 3, T790M mutation ratio were 100% and 30% homogeneously and showed increased EGFR copy number also homogeneously. However, in case 1, it was different between invasive and non-invasive areas. EGFR copy number was also heterogeneous and showed increasing only in invasive area. We indicated a peculiar case harboring T790M heterogeneity and only invasive area had T790M mutation even though the case was not treated by EGFR TKI.

For this, we analyzed an uterine endometrial adenocarcinoma and an ovarian aGCT in a same patient by a targeted next generation sequencing (NGS). We found a germline mutation in STK11 (p.L113fs). The endometrial adenocarcinoma harbored FGFR2 and TP53 mutations and the aGCT harbored a FOXL2 (p.C134\u202fW) mutation. These germline and somatic mutations have been reported in non-concurrent tumors. These two tumors harbored 20 CNAs but only one CNA was exactly overlapped in the tumors. Our findings indicate that the concurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma and aGCT in this patient might not be genetically related to each other at germline or somatic level and suggest that such concurrence might be originated from non-genetic backgrounds including stimulated estrogen milieu.",

     "abstract": "Aberrant proliferation and migration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells contributes to the pathology of various ocular diseases. miR-27b has been reported to be crucial in the regulation of cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration. However, the role of miR-27b on RPE proliferation and migration remains largely unknown. Here the effect of miR-27b on ARPE-19 cells under platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB stimulation was explored. In this study, we found that the expression level of miR-27b was significantly reduced in ARPE-19 cells under PDGF-BB stimulation. Ectopic expression of miR-27b remarkably inhibited PDGF-BB-induced proliferation and migration in ARPE-19 cells. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis and luciferase reporter assay showed that NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2) was a direct target for miR-27b, and that knockdown of Nox2 expression mimicked the inhibitory effect of miR-27b on PDGF-BB \u2212induced proliferation and migration in ARPE-19 cells, whereas, restoration of Nox2 expression showed an opposite effect. In addition, the ROS production and the activation of P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling induced by PDGF-BB were also suppressed by miR-27b overexpression or Nox2 silencing. Thus, these findings indicated that miR-27b exerted its protective role in RPE cells under PDGF-BB stimulation was partially through regulation of Nox2 and its downstream P13K/AKT/mTOR signaling, which might be a potential therapeutic approach for treatment of diseases caused by RPE proliferation, and migration.",

We also reviewed three patients with diffuse whitish mucosa and three patients with no whitish lesions. We performed scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry to quantify the lanthanum elements (wt%) in the biopsy specimens.The amount of lanthanum in the Bw ranged from 0.15\u20130.31\u202fwt%, whereas that of Bp was 0.00\u20130.13\u202fwt%. The difference was statistically significant (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). The amount of lanthanum in the Bw, endoscopically presented with white spots or annular whitish mucosa, was significantly higher than that of no whitish lesions (0.05\u20130.14\u202fwt%, P\u202f<\u202f0.05).

However, its prognostic value for gliomas is still controversy, and the methylation at specific CpG sites of DAPK1 has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to prognostically evaluate the methylation level of different CpG sites within DAPK1 promoter region in gliomas.Based on sodium bisulfite treated DNA products, we made use of DNA pyrosequencing method to evaluate overall and site-specific methylation of DAPK1 in 143 gliomas and 26 benign tumors (meningeomas) or normal brain tissues. We both statistically analyzed the association between methylation levels of each CpG site and the clinicopathological characteristics, and estimated the prognosis predictive value of site-specific methylation for glioma patients.Methylation status of DAPK1 site \u22121527, \u22121543, and the overall five sites concerned was higher in gliomas than controlled subjects (p\u202f<\u202f0.001).

However, Cox regression analysis indicated the site-specific methylation was not independent contributor for gliomas prognosis.Analysis of DAPK1 gene promoter by quantitative pyrosequencing provided more detailed information of methylation status of CpG sites. DAPK1 methylation level is associated with gliomas clinical features and outcomes. Interestingly, the hypermethylation at site \u22121527 or together with site \u22121543 indicated good sensitivity of postoperative therapies, especially radiotherapy.

A minimally invasive method of cytology sampling of mediastinal lymph nodes using endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) has emerged as a useful tool in diagnosis. Between January 2010 and April 2018, we performed 1744 EBUS-TBNA studies of mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes for a variety of clinical indications including mediastinal malignancy. Sixteen patients (93.7% males, mean age 59.1 years, range 44\u201381 years) were diagnosed by cytological and cell block study to have metastatic clear cell RCC. Twelve patients had been diagnosed with clear cell RCC in the past (mean 39 months, range 4\u201389 months) while in four, the tumor was primarily diagnosed in the staging phase on the basis of EBUS-TBNA. The EBUS features of the mediastinal nodal masses included increase of size (mean 2.5\u202fcm, range 1.6\u20133.8\u202fcm), irregular, inhomogeneous, hypervascular, and hyperechoic echotexture. EBUS-TBNA is a procedure safe and effective for evaluating mediastinal lymphadenopathy in patients with clear cell RCC. Immunohistochemistry in the cell block is decisive for proper diagnosis. The cytologist plays a key role in the diagnosis of metastatic clear cell RCC due to the treatment implications that this neoplasm encompasses.",

The increasing demand for NGS-based multiplexed molecular diagnostics requires standardized protocols and recommendations to ensure reproducibility and accuracy of test results for routine clinical decision making. However, the lack of clinical NGS data from multi-laboratory tests and the absence of inter-laboratory comparisons have hampered the establishment of instructive clinical NGS standards. To fill the gap, we set up Proficiency Testing (PT) for inter-laboratory comparison, in which formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens from eight lung and eight colon cancers were analyzed by 15 European molecular diagnostic laboratories on three different platforms using multiple target enrichment systems. We first performed platform, test, and informatics pipeline validation and conducted sensitivity and specificity analysis by random in silico down-sampling. We then implemented a multi-level filtering strategy based on performance tests of base substitution, replicate runs, and Sanger sequencing verified variants. We finally applied the filter criteria to the NGS data from the respective PT participants and obtained high inter-laboratory agreement. We demonstrated accuracy, scalability, and robustness of NGS by means of PT, serving as a benchmark for detecting clinically actionable molecular alterations in research and diagnostic laboratories. In conclusion, this study strongly highlights the importance of establishing standards for NGS-based testing, particularly when the test results impact on clinical decisions, and systematically provides data sets from multiple different labs to infer such standards.",

The role of SOX2 in this tumor type as well as other soft tissue tumor entities however is still poorly characterized. We analyzed SOX2 protein expression in soft tissue tumors. Alongside we tested Histone H3 expression (H3K27me3) in SOX2 positive cases to investigate this epigenetic mark and its correlation with the SOX2 status and clinicopathological parameters.In total, 60 samples of synovial sarcomas from the reference center for soft tissue tumors at the institute of pathology of the Jena University hospital were included into the study along with 343 other tissue tumors. Protein analysis was done by immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays. All synovial sarcoma cases were confirmed by molecular testing using SS18 FISH break apart probes.SOX2 reactivity was detectable in 35 synovial sarcoma cases (58.3%) while 25 (41.7%) were negative. Only 13 cases of the other 343 soft tissue tumors, varying from nodular fasciitis to undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, revealed a SOX2 expression, 12 out of these were undifferentiated high grade sarcoma. There was no obvious correlation with the clinicopathological data. H3K27me3 immunohistochemistry of the synovial sarcoma cases revealed a high statistically significant correlation between SOX2 and H3K27me3 expression (p\u202f<\u202f0,0005, Chi square test). Similar to SOX2, there was no correlation between H3K27me3 expression and tumor grade. Six SOX2 positive synovial sarcoma cases were analyzed by FISH using a SOX2/CEN3 dual color FISH probe. None of these cases revealed an amplification of the SOX2 gene.The data confirms previous studies reporting SOX2 and H3K27me3 expression in synovial sarcoma and reveals that both biomarkers are related to each other. It strengthens the notion that the tumor type is driven by epigenetic processes similar to those that are operating in pluripotent stem cells. The relevance of these parameters in the pathway pathology of synovial sarcoma, i.e. the timing and dosing of SOX2 and H3K27me3 expression initiated by the SS18-SSX driver mutation together with the interplay of these events with other signaling pathways, cellular mechanisms and additional mutations in tumor progression, will require further studies.",

Our previous study revealed an implication of Notch 1 and 2 in the post-stroke seizure. This study further investigated the involvement of Notch 3 and 4 in post-stroke seizure and the effect of mild hypothermia on these two factors. A global cerebral ischemia (GCI) model was conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. Seizure activity was evaluated by the frequency of seizure attacks, seizure severity scores, and seizure discharges. Seizures were frequently occurred in the first and the second 24\u202fh after GCI, however active whole-body cooling (mild hypothermia) and DAPT (Notch inhibitor) injection into the hippocampus, alone or in combination, alleviated seizure activity after GCI. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot assays revealed the up-regulation of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) 3 and 4 in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus following GCI, but mild hypothermia and DAPT inhibited the up-regulation of NICD 3 and 4. NF-\u03baB, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b3, cyclin D1, Sox2 and Pax6 are associated with the pathogenesis of diverse type of seizures. GCI induced NF-\u03baB, cyclin D1, and Pax6 activity, but suppressed PPAR\u03b3. These effects of GCI were abolished by both mild hypothermia and DAPT treatment. This indicated the implication of Notch signaling in the effects of GCI. Collectively, mild hypothermia inhibits Notch 3 and Notch 4 activation and seizure after stroke in the rat model. This study adds to the further understanding of the pathogenesis of post-stroke seizures and the protective mechanism of mild hypothermia.",

     "abstract": "The human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family has been widely studied in cancer, however, the prognostic role of EGFR family expression in lymph node-negative esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) patients have not been invalidated. This study was designed to determine the prognostic value of EGFR family expression in a population of lymph node-negative ESCC patients treated with curative resection. EGFR family protein expression was examined by immunohistochemical analysis of tissue microarrays of 94 patients with lymph node-negative ESCC after radical esophagectomy with three-field lymphadenectomy. Survival differences were compared using Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the prognostic factors for overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS). ErbB4 expression was found to be an independent prognostic factor for DFS in patients without lymph node metastasis; increased ErbB4 expression was associated with decreased DFS. Additionally, patients with high ErbB4 expression tended to have worse overall survival. EGFR, ErbB2 and ErbB3 expression were not significantly associated with survival in lymph node-negative ESCC patients. Increased ErbB4 immunohistochemical expression was associated with poor prognosis in lymph node-negative ESCC patients.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the biggest challenges that human beings faced with in 21st century. Previous researches have revealed that miRNAs can serve as regulators in various cancers. MiR-876-5p, a member of miRNA family, has been studied in lung cancer for its anti-oncogenic function. However, the exact function of it is not reported in HCC. Our study aims to find out the effects of miR-876-5p expression on HCC progression. Two HCC cells were chosen to do functional assays after miR-876-5p expression was detected in cell lines by qRT-PCR. HepG2 cell was transfected with miR-876-5p mimics, whereas LM3 cell was transfected with miR-876-5p inhibitors. Next, cell activities of these two indicated cells were analyzed by means of MTT assay, colony forming assay, transwell migration assay and western blot analysis. Consequently, we found that miR-876-5p could inhibit both cell proliferation and metastasis. Moreover, we found out a target gene (DNMT3A) of miR-876-5p by performing bioinformatics analysis, dual luciferase reporter assay and biotin-avidin pull-down assay. Finally, rescue assays were carried out in HepG2 cells. We found that DNMT3A could reverse miR-876-5p mimics-induced inhibition. Therefore, we concluded that miR-876-5p suppressed hepatocellular carcinoma progression by targeting DNMT3A.",

The tumor promoting/suppressing activities of YAP and SHP2 during liver tumorigenesis remain controversial. This study aimed to investigate the tumorigenic roles of YAP and SHP2 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Cell density associated subcellular distributions of YAP and SHP2 in normal human hepatocytes (THLE-2) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells (SK-Hep1, SNU-182) were investigated by Western blotting and cell block immunohistochemistry. The effects of YAP knockdown on proliferation, migration and invasion were studied using YAP-specific siRNAs. The prognostic significance of YAP and SHP2 expressions was investigated immunohistochemically using a tissue microarray (TMA) from 50 HCC cases. High-cell density decreased the nuclear expression of YAP and SHP2 in normal hepatocytes as compared with low-cell density. However, in HCC cells, nuclear YAP and SHP2 were observed regardless of cell density. Nuclear YAP influenced SHP2 expression and cell proliferation. In particular, YAP knockdown impacted nuclear levels of SHP2 protein in SK-Hep1 cells. In HCC tissues, nuclear YAP expression was elevated and cytoplasmic SHP2 expression was diminished as compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues. Notably, these expressions were found to be significantly associated with poor recurrence-free and overall survival rate in patients with HCC. Consequently, the tumor promoting role of YAP is involved in SHP2 which functions as a tumor promoter in vitro but as a tumor suppressor in vivo. YAP and SHP2 can be unfavorable prognostic markers in HCC.",

MiTF has been known to be positive in FH tumors, but this is the first study evaluating ninety-three fibrohistiocytic neoplasms to understand and delineate the staining pattern of MiTF in these tumors. Ninety-three cases of FH, 30 cases of melanocytic lesions, and 20 miscellaneous cases were studied.

Benign fibrous histiocytoma were sub-categorized into dermatofibroma (n\u202f=\u202f15) and epithelioid fibrous histiocytoma (n\u202f=\u202f14). The melanocytic lesions included desmoplastic melanoma (DM, n\u202f=\u202f8), melanoma in-situ (MIS, n\u202f=\u202f5), re-excision-free of melanoma (RFM, n\u202f=\u202f10), blue nevus (BN, n\u202f=\u202f5), and spitz nevus (SN, n\u202f=\u202f3).

Elevated mRNA levels were observed in 26%, 15%, 13%, 12% and 10% of the cases for TRAIL-R4, TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R2, TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL genes respectively.

We profiled, by in situ hybridization (ISH), miR-21 expression in a series of 26 AVCs, 50 ampullary dysplastic lesions (35 low-grade [LG-IEN] and 15 high-grade [HG-IEN]) and 10 normal duodenal mucosa samples. The same series was investigated by immunohistochemistry for \u03b2-catenin, p53 and HER2 expression. HER2 gene amplification was evaluated by chromogenic in situ hybridization. To validate miR-21 ISH results we performed miR-21 qRT-PCR analysis in a series of 10 AVCs and their matched normal samples. All the normal control samples showed a negative or faint miR-21 expression, whereas a significant miR-21 up-regulation was observed during the carcinogenetic cascade (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), with 21/26 (80.8%) of cancer samples showing a miR-21 overexpression.

No significant difference in miR-21 overexpression was observed between LG-IEN, HG-IEN and AVCs. By qRT-PCR analysis, AVCs showed a 1.7-fold increase over the controls (p\u202f=\u202f.003). P53 was frequently dysregulated in both dysplastic and carcinoma samples (44 out of 76; 57.9%). A 20% (10/50) of dysplastic lesions and 11% (3/26) of carcinomas were characterized by a nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin. Only 2 AVCs (7.7%; both intestinal-type) showed a HER2 overexpression (both 2+), which corresponded to a HER2 gene amplification at CISH analysis.

     "abstract": "Neuroendocrine differentiation (NED) is a common phenomenon in prostate cancer, and it has been associated with poor prognosis in some studies of primary prostate cancer. Incidence and patterns of NED in metastatic prostate cancer sites have not been examined widely. In this study, we studied expression of three commonly used markers of NED (chromogranin A, neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin) in 89 metastases from 31 men that died of castration-resistant prostate cancer and underwent rapid autopsy, and in 89 hormone-na\u00efve primary tumors removed by radical prostatectomy. In addition, we examined NED association with androgen receptor, ERG and Ki-67 expression in metastatic tumor sites. Morphologically, 1 of 31 cases was classified as small cell carcinoma, and the remaining 30 were classified as usual prostate adenocarcinoma using a recently proposed classification of prostate cancers with NED. Metastases showed more expression of neuron specific enolase and synaptophysin compared to prostatectomies (6.3% of cells vs. 1.0%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001 and 4.0% vs. 0.4%, p\u202f<\u202f0.001, respectively). At least focal expression of one of the markers was seen in 78% of metastases. Strong expression was relatively uncommon, seen in 3/89 (chromogranin A), 8/89 (neuron specific enolase), and 5/89 (synaptophysin) metastases. Expression of chromogranin A and synaptophysin correlated with each other (r\u202f=\u202f0.64, p\u202f<\u202f0.001), but expression of neuron specific enolase did not correlate with the two other markers. Extent of NED varied significantly between different metastatic sites in individual patients. Absent androgen receptor expression was associated with strong expression of chromogranin A (p\u202f=\u202f.02) and neuron specific enolase (p\u202f=\u202f.02), but not with focal expression of any marker. No clear association was found between expression of NE markers and ERG or Ki-67. In conclusion, NED is a common and heterogeneous phenomenon in metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer.

The expression level of lncRNA FEZF-AS1 and FEZF1 was determined by the quantitative Real-time PCR in 160 cases of NSCLC tissues and their adjacent non-tumour tissues. We found that lncRNA FEZF-AS1 was significantly up-regulated in tumour tissues when compared to the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P\u202f=\u202f0.001), and it\u2019s high expression correlated with advanced stages (P\u202f=\u202f0.002) and Tumour Family History (P\u202f=\u202f0.029). Meanwhile, In 58 cases of NSCLC tissues the expression of lncRNA FEZF-AS1 was positively associated with that of FEZF1expression (r\u202f=\u202f0.8810, p\u202f=\u202f1.6575E-20).

In the present study, ATF3, p53, and p53 target gene Bax expression increased in CD patients; a mouse 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced CD model; and a TNF-\u03b1-treated HT29 cell colitis model. ATF3 knockdown effectively decreased TNF-\u03b1-induced p53 and Bax expression, as well as inhibited the apoptosis of HT29 cells.

Old age, frontal location, and grade IV were found to be predictive factors of TERTp mutation. TERTp mutation resulted in poor prognosis in overall diffuse gliomas. TERTp mutation was not correlated with overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in the diffuse gliomas. However, TERTp mutations, in combination with MGMT methylation or IDH mutation, showed that there were statistical significant survival differences between MGMT-unmethylated/TERTp-mutated and MGMT-unmethylated/TERTp-wildtype subgroups in grade II gliomas. There was a statistical significant survival difference of OS between IDH-wildtype/TERTp-mutated and IDH-mutated/TERTp-mutated subgroups in grade III gliomas.

In addition, SIRT-1 activation state and environmental cytokine were identified as being responsible for cancer cells responses to CRT. Herein, we investigate the role of interleukin 6 (IL-6) as a tumor environmental cytokine and SIRT1 in the effectiveness of NVP-BEZ235 plus radiotherapy.TNBC cells were pre-treated with/without IL-6 and were exposed to single and combination of SRT1720 (SIRT1 activator)/EX-527 (SIRT1 inhibitor) and/or NVP-BEZ235 and/or gamma radiation. The effect of our treatments on cellular growth was determined by MTT and the cellular death and CSCs percentage were determined by Flow cytometry. Senescence detection kit was used to assay the effect of our treatments on cellular senescence induction.Activation of SIRT1 via SRT1720 increased the efficacy of CRT in TNBC cells, especially when IL-6 exists in tumor microenvironment. Additionally, IL-6 pre-treatment followed by exposure to SRT1720 and NVP-BEZ235 significantly increased sensitivity of the cancer stem cells to radiation (p\u202f<\u202f0.05).Our result shows that combination of NVP-BEZ235 and SRT1720 may effectively improve late stage breast cancer cells therapeutics approach.

     "abstract": "Locally advanced colorectal carcinomas are characterized by neoplastic cells that invade beyond the colon and directly into surrounding organs and structures that include the retroperitoneum and abdominopelvic sidewall. These aggressive tumors are prognostically adverse and are categorized with highest possible tumor stage in current cancer staging systems. Recognizing colorectal carcinoma with extensive locoregional invasion is typically straightforward, but some cases can be diagnostically challenging. These include tumors with limited invasion of extracolonic tissue such as the subserosa in which there are no cells or structures that are histologically or architecturally distinct from the colonic primary. Tumor-associated injury of the colonic peritoneum often precedes invasion by the neoplastic cells and can cause the peritoneal membrane of the colon to adhere and subsequently fuse to the peritoneal membrane of a neighboring organ or structure, thereby creating a trans-peritoneal bridge through which a tumor can directly invade the adherent extracolonic tissue. Hence, locally advanced colorectal carcinoma can be narrowly defined by neoplastic cells that completely invade through the fused peritoneal membrane and into the subserosa of the adherent extracolonic tissue. The evaluation of tumor invasion of the fused peritoneal membrane, which is enhanced by the combined use of an elastic stain and an immunostain for pan-keratin, is essential for the proper staging of locally advanced colorectal carcinoma and its clinical management.",

Clinicopathological parameters regarding sex, age, tumour size, tumour duration, tumour location, treatment, recurrences, radiographic features, vestibular/lingual and basal cortical disruption and follow-up data were obtained from patients\u2019 medical records and correlated with the proteins expression. The results on BRAF-V600E expression were obtained from our previous study and correlated with COX-2 and CD34 expressions.

Twenty-eight cases (44.4%) exhibited cytoplasmic positivity for COX-2, predominantly in the columnar peripheral cells, with a mean MVD of 2.2 vessels/mm2. COX-2 was significantly associated with recurrences (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and BRAF-V600E expression (p\u202f<\u202f0.001), whereas lower MVD was associated with the use of conservative therapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.004).

After DNA extraction for all the subjects, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify and sequence variable numbers of tandem repeat (VNTR) loci of SMYD3 gene. SMYD3 gene was genotyped and its frequency distribution was calculated. Age, education level, income, smoking and drinking history, HCC family history, tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging, maximum tumor diameter, lymph node metastasis (LNM) etc. were investigated. Correlation of SMYD3 gene polymorphism and other risk factors with the occurrence and prognosis of HCC was analyzed.The family history of HCC, drinking history, cirrhosis, and HBV or/and HCV infection, SMYD3 VNTR 3/3 were more frequently observed in subjects with HCC. Patients with SMYD3 VNTR 3/3 genotype, drinking-history, family history of HCC, cirrhosis and hepatitis B virus (HBV), TNM staging, maximum tumor diameter, LNM were more vulnerable to HCC. Besides, patients with SMYD3 VNTR 3/3 genotype had lower 2- and 3-year survival rate.

Bioinformatics tools were applied to further explore the potential mechanism of telocinobufagin in breast cancer using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway, Gene ontology (GO) enrichment, panther, and protein\u2013protein interaction analyses. To better comprehend the role of telocinobufagin in breast cancer, we also queried the Connectivity Map using the gene expression profiles of telocinobufagin treatment.One GEO accession (GSE85871) provided 1251 differentially expressed genes after telocinobufagin treatment on MCF-7 cells. The pathway of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs), intestinal immune network for IgA production, hematopoietic cell lineage and calcium signaling pathway were the key pathways from KEGG analysis. IGF1 and KSR1, owning to higher protein levels in breast cancer tissues, IGF1 and KSR1 could be the hub genes related to telocinobufagin treatment. It was indicated that the molecular mechanism of telocinobufagin resembled that of fenspiride.Telocinobufagin might regulate neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway to exert its influences in breast cancer MCF-7 cells, and its molecular mechanism might share some similarities with fenspiride.

     "abstract": "Lung squamous cell cancer (LUSC) is a common but challenging malignancy. It is important to illuminate the molecular mechanism of LUSC. Thus, we aim to explore the molecular mechanism of miR-136-5p in relation to LUSC.We used the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database to investigate the expression of miR-136-5p in relation to LUSC. Then, we identified the possible miR-136-5p target genes through intersection of the predicted miR-136-5p target genes and LUSC upregulated genes from TCGA. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to determine the key miR-136-5p targets and pathways associated with LUSC. Finally, the expression of hub genes, correlation between miR-136-5p and hub genes, and expected significance of hub genes were evaluated via the TCGA and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project.MiR-136-5p was significantly downregulated in LUSC patients. Glucuronidation, glucuronosyltransferase, and the retinoic acid metabolic process were the most enriched metabolic interactions in LUSC patients. Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and retinol metabolism were identified as crucial pathways. Seven hub genes (UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, UGT1A10, SRD5A1, and ADH7) were found to be upregulated, and UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A6, UGT1A7, and ADH7 were negatively correlated with miR-136-5p. UGT1A7 and ADH7 were the most significantly involved miR-136-5p target genes, and high expression of these genes was correlated with better overall survival and disease-free survival of LUSC patients.Downregulated miR-136-5p may target UGT1A7 and ADH7 and participate in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and retinol metabolism. High expression of UGT1A7 and ADH7 may indicate better prognosis of LUSC patients.",

In this study, we investigated the relevance of Prdx1 in the metastasis and angiogenesis of CRC. The expression of Prdx1 in 60 cases human CRC tissues was detected through immunohistochemistry. The tumors that highly expressed Prdx1 (42/60) exhibited higher tumor grade and lymph node metastasis than those with low expression of Prdx1 (18/60) (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis showed that the survival time of thePrdx1-positive group was shorter than that of thePrdx1-negative group (p\u202f=\u202f0.046).Moreover, a statistically significant correlation was observed between the Prdx1 expression and microvessel density (p\u202f=\u202f0.004). Transwell migration assay revealed that Prdx1 was down-regulated in the CRC cell line HCT116, thereby suppressing the invasion and migration capacities of tumor cells, whereas Prdx1was up-regulated in HT29 cells, thereby increasing the invasion and migration capacities of tumor cells. The tube formation capacity of human umbilical vein endothelial cells cultured in 3D medium was increased after conditioned medium from overexpressed Prdx1cancer cells was added relative to that when down-regulated Prdx1 cell medium was added (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). In addition, up-regulated Prdx1 increased the protein expression of MMP2, MMP9, and VEGFA. These data suggested that Prdx1 expression predicted poor prognosis by regulating the tumor metastasis and angiogenesis of CRC. Therefore, Prdx1 may serve as a potential therapeutic target.",

B cell-associated protein 31 (BAP31) was shown to participate in the apoptosis, and to be an immunotherapy target and a, prognostic factor for cancer, but its role in CRC has not been elucidated. In this study, we examined the expression of BAP31 in CRC to evaluate its prognostic values. We investigated the BAP31 expression level in 142 tissues (108 CRC and 17 paired human adjacent normal mucosa, and 17 liver metastatic CRC tissues) from 108 patients, using tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry. We further investigated the association between BAP31 expression and overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in 77 CRC patients using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were applied to evaluate the potential prognostic value of BAP31 in CRC patients. BAP31 expression level was significantly increased in CRC tissues (p\u202f=\u202f0.0014) and liver metastatic CRC tissues (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) compared with corresponding adjacent normal mucosa. BAP31 expression was also significantly increased in liver metastatic CRC tissues compared with corresponding primary CRC tissues (p\u202f=\u202f0.0116). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that CRC patients with low BAP31 expression had significantly lower survival rate (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and lower disease-free survival rate (P\u202f=\u202f0.009). Furthermore, multivariate Cox analysis showed that BAP31 was an independent prognostic factor for OS (hazard ratio\u202f=\u202f0.410, 95% confidence interval\u202f=\u202f0.195\u20130.862, p\u202f=\u202f0.019).Our study demonstrated that BAP31 is a potential prognostic marker for CRC patients after surgery.",

This study aims to explore correlations of pri-let-7 gene polymorphisms with the recurrence and metastasis of primary liver cancer (PLC) after a transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) surgical procedure.A total of 302 PLC patients treated with hepatoprotective therapies after TACE were selected to and assigned into recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Genotypes of pri-let-7a-1 rs1073997 and pri-let-7a-2 rs629367 were analyzed by Taqman assay. The relationship between PLC with the mutation of each SNP was determined by a multivariate logistic regression analyses. Moreover, the association between survival and pri-let-7 gene polymorphisms was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. The Progress Free Survival (PFS) curve, correlation of pri-let-7a-1 rs629367 with alcohol, HBsAg-positive and TNM III/IV were analyzed by a stratified analysis. Additionally, the risk factors for the recurrence of PLC were analyzed by a multivariate logistic regression analyses.Results showed that the allelic frequency of the pri-let-7a-2 rs629367 SNP in the recurrent group was higher than that of the non-recurrent group. The distribution of CC genotype was significantly higher than non-CC genotype in the recurrent group. Alcohol consumption, positive expression of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), AC\u202f+\u202fCC genotype of rs629367 and TNM III/IV were determined to be the risk factors for the recurrence and metastasis of PLC after TACE. We found a positive correlation between pri-let-7a-2 rs629367 with alcohol consumption, HBsAg-positive and TNM III/IV. The median PFS of HBsAg-positive and TNM III/IV patients with the AC\u202f+\u202fCC genotype of rs629367 was shorter than those with non-AC\u202f+\u202fCC genotype.Our findings provide evidence that patients with PLC that carry the AC\u202f+\u202fCC genotype of pri-let-7a-2 rs629367 after TACE have a worse prognosis than those who carry the AA genotype.

The significance of PTEN mutations resulting in variable PTEN expression and their impact on prognosis of breast cancer is not well established. The objective of our study was to correlate the immunohistochemical expression of PTEN in the four major subtypes of breast carcinoma (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 positive, and Triple Negative) in a population of 202 African-American (AA) females with other clinicopathological factors.Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were constructed from FFPE tumor blocks from primary ductal breast carcinomas in 202 African-American females. Five micrometer sections were stained with a mouse monoclonal antibody against PTEN. The sections were evaluated for the intensity of cytoplasmic and nuclear reactivity. Bivariate analysis was done via \u03c72 analysis and survivability data was calculated via the generation of Kaplan-Meier curves (SPSS v19).Loss of PTEN expression was associated with ER negative (p\u202f=\u202f0.021), PR negative (p\u202f=\u202f0.024) and triple negative (p\u202f=\u202f0.0024) breast ductal cancers. It was marginally associated with distant metastasis (p\u202f=\u202f0.074). There was no association between PTEN loss and recurrence-free survival or overall survival.In our study, a statistically significant association between PTEN loss and the triple negative breast cancers (TNBC) was found in AA women. PTEN inhibits PI3\u202fK resulting in decreased activation of downstream effector, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Loss of PTEN results in cell proliferation through activation of mTOR.

Hence, we aimed to molecularly characterize these tumors. An extensive review of literature was performed.In a multi-institutional effort, all the cases of glioblastoma of year 2017 were reviewed. Cases with predominant epithelioid morphology were analysed. Seven cases of e-gbm (adults:4 and pediatric: 3) were identified. Duration of symptoms varied from 2 weeks to one month. Radiologically, all cases were supratentorial, contrast enhancing with solid and cystic appearance. Majority of the cases were immunopositive for GFAP (71%), EMA (71%), S100 (71%) and vimentin (85%). All the cases showed ATRX, INI-1 and H3K27me3 expression. BRAFV600Emutation was seen in 28% of cases. TERT mutation was seen in 40% cases, while one case showed EGFR amplification. H3F3A mutations and PTEN deletions were seen in none.

Both SIRT1 and PPAR \u01b3 were highly expressed in tumor tissues comparing with non-cancerous epithelium. High expression of SIRT1 was positively correlated with advanced TNM stage and poor outcome, while high expression of PPAR \u01b3 was positively related with tumor grading, not with patients\u2019 prognosis. In addition, the high expression of SIRT1 was positively correlated with overexpression of EGFR, not related with PPAR \u01b3 or Survivin expression status.

It was found that matrine could suppress KYSE-150 cell proliferation and significantly mediate cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent relation by increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species level and triggering mitochondrial membrane potential disruption. More precise mechanism studies demonstrated that matrine could up-regulate the expression of Bax proteins and down-regulate the expression of Bcl-2 proteins, as well as the activation about caspase-3, 8 and 9 in KYSE-150 cells.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the possible roles and related target genes of miR-486-5p in NSCLC progression.pcDNA3.1(+)/Pri-miR486 recombinant plasmid and miR-486-5p inhibitor were transfected into NSCLC cells and theirs effects were evaluated by qRT-PCR.

We also initially investigated the target genes of miR-486-5p by using bioinformatic methods, qRT-PCR and western blot.pcDNA3.1(+)/Pri-miR486 recombinant plasmid significantly upregulated the expression of miR-486-5p, while miR-486-5p inhibitor significantly downregulated its expression. Upregulation of miR-486-5p promoted the cellular proliferation and cloning, while miR-486-5p silencing restrained the cellular proliferation and cloning. Furthermore, four potential target genes (PIK3R1, PTEN, MAP3K7 and FOXO1) of miR-486-5p were screened out. Finally, we found that upregulation of miR-486-5p in NSCLC cells significantly reduced PTEN and increased AKT expression levels, whereas miR-486-5p silencing increased PTEN and reduced AKT expression. Therefore, we believe that miR-486-5p can regulate PTEN-PI3 K/AKT signaling.miR-486-5p acts as an oncogene in the progression of NSCLC by influencing PTEN-PI3 K/AKT signaling. miR-486-5p may provide potential therapeutic targets for NSCLC.",

However, the molecular mechanism of miR-452-5p in prostate cancer remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the network of target genes of miR-452-5p in prostate cancer using bioinformatics analyses.We first analyzed the expression profiles and prognostic value of miR-452-5p in prostate cancer tissues from a public database. Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), PANTHER pathway analyses, and a disease ontology (DG) analysis were performed to find the molecular functions of the target genes from GSE datasets and miRWalk. Finally, we validated hub genes from the protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) networks of the target genes in the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database and Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA). Narrowing down the optimal target genes was conducted by seeking the common parts of up-regulated genes from GEPIA, down-regulated genes from GSE datasets, and predicted genes in miRWalk.Based on mining of GEO and ArrayExpress microarray chips and miRNA-Seq data in the TCGA database, which includes 1007 prostate cancer samples and 387 non-cancer samples, miR-452-5p is shown to be down-regulated in prostate cancer. GO, KEGG, and PANTHER pathway analyses suggested that the target genes might participate in important biological processes, such as transforming growth factor beta signaling and the positive regulation of brown fat cell differentiation and mesenchymal cell differentiation, as well as the Ras signaling pathway and pathways regulating the pluripotency of stem cells and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). Nine genes\u2014GABBR, PNISR, NTSR1, DOCK1, EREG, SFRP1, PTGS2, LEF1, and BMP2\u2014were defined as hub genes in the PPI network. Three genes\u2014FAM174B, SLC30A4, and SLIT1\u2014were jointly shared by GEPIA, the GSE datasets, and miRWalk.Down-regulated miR-452-5p might play an essential role in the tumorigenesis of prostate cancer.",

     "abstract": "It is generally acknowledged that miRNAs play pivotal roles in the initiation and development of cancer. The aim of the current study is to investigate the clinicopathological role of miR-136-5p in lung adenocarcinoma and its underlying molecular mechanism.Data of a cohort of 1242 samples were provided by the Gene Expression Omnibus and The Cancer Genome Atlas to evaluate miR-136-5p expression in lung adenocarcinoma. A comprehensive meta-analysis integrating the expression data from all sources was performed, followed by a summary receiver operating curve plotted to appraise the upregulated expression of miR-136-5p in lung adenocarcinoma. Candidate targets of miR-136-5p were launched by the intersection of differentially expressed genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas and genes predicted by 12 web-based platforms. Then, hub genes were illustrated by a protein-protein interaction network. Furthermore, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology and Protein Analysis Through Evolutionary Relationships analyses of potential target genes were carried out via bioinformatics tools.MiR-136-5p expression was upregulated in lung adenocarcinoma versus normal tissues (standard mean difference\u202f=\u202f0.43, 95% confidence interval: 0.27-0.58). The summary receiver operating characteristic curve further verified the upregulation of miR-136-5p in lung adenocarcinoma (area under curve\u202f=\u202f0.7459). A total of 311 candidate target genes of miR-136-5p were gathered to create a protein-protein interaction network. Molecular mechanism analysis unveiled the potential miR-136-5p target genes participated in cell adhesion molecules, focal adhesion, complement and coagulation cascades and blood coagulation.MiR-136-5p is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma and is involved in the molecular mechanism of lung adenocarcinoma via suppressing the expressions of downstream targets, especially claudin-18, sialophorin and syndecan 2 that participate in cell adhesion.",

Diagnoses were confirmed by histopathology. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed to detect and qualify the mRNAs of HPV E6/E7, STAT3, and Survivin in cervical exfoliated cells. In addition, the performance of separate and combined mRNA detection methods were compared with TCT, HR-HPV DNA schemes respectively.1. Compared with HPVE6/E7 and STAT3 mRNA methods, Survivin mRNA assay had poor specificity (Sp), Youden index (YI) and concordance rate. 2. HPV E6/E7, STAT3, and STAT3\u202f+\u202fHR-HPV methods had the best Sp, concordance rate and positive predictive value (PPV) for cervical lesions screening and atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) triage. For screening of high grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or greater (HSILs+), no difference was observed in the Se of mRNA detection methods in comparison with that of TCT, HR-HPV and TCT\u202f+\u202fHR-HPV, whereas the false positive rate (FPR) decreased by 41.48%/55.99%/17.19% and the colposcopy referral rate reduced by about 20.00%/25.00%/11.17%.

The expression of HPV E6/E7 and STAT3 mRNA confirmed using FISH assay is expected to be a new method and molecular marker for cervical lesions screening. Survivin mRNA was excluded due to its poor performance. 2. HPV E6/E7, STAT3, and STAT3 +HR-HPV assays could be new approaches for cervical cancer screening and ASCUS triage, and the efficiency of combined screening program was better than that of a separate one. 3.

However, the molecular mechanisms of miR-1260b underlying NSCLC progression and metastasis remain dismal.The expression of miR-1260b in NSCLC tissues and cell lines were examined by real-time PCR, the effects of miR-1260b on cell migration, invasion and proliferation were evaluated in vitro. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the targets of miR-1260b, and the association between miR-1260b and its target gene was determined by real-time PCR and western blot assay.The results showed that miR-1260b was significantly upregulated in NSCLC cell lines. The inhibition of miR-1260b expression decreased the migratory and invasive rates in A549 cells while miR-1260b overexpression had the opposite effect. Furthermore, PTPRK was identified as a direct target of miR-1260b, and PTPRK expression was inversely correlated with miR-1260b in NSCLC cell lines and clinical tissues.These results suggested that miR-1260b may play an important role in NSCLC metastasis progression and could serve as a putative target for diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play important roles in tumor formation and development. Small nucleolar RNA host gene 6 (SNHG6) is a recently identified cancer-related lncRNA, and its role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be explored. The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression and function of SNHG6 in CRC. The expression of SNHG6 was detected by real time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) in 74 CRC tissues and matched noncancerous tissues (NCTs). Relationships between the expression levels of SNHG6 and various clinicopathological features were analyzed by Chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test were applied to compare the survival distribution between different groups. CCK8 assay and colony formation assay were used to measure the effect of SNGH6 on cell proliferation. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to measure the effect of SNHG6 on cell cycle and apoptosis. Our results showed that SNHG6 was up-regulated more than 1.5-fold in 50.0% (37/74) of CRC tissues compared with paired NCTs (P\u202f<\u202f0.0001). High level of SNHG6 expression was strongly associated with advanced tumor stage (P\u202f=\u202f0.026) and predicted poor prognosis of CRC (P\u202f=\u202f0.0215). The Cox proportional hazards model demonstrated that SNHG6 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CRC (HR, 2.568; 95% CI, 1.055\u20136.252; P\u202f=\u202f0.038). Furthermore, SNHG6 knockdown by siRNA could inhibit cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and induce apoptosis. Taken together, SNHG6 functions as an oncogene in CRC and appears as a novel prognositic factor for CRC patients.",

In this study, we aimed to analyze the expression and function of miR-449a in breast cancer.A total of 15 human primary breast cancer tissues and adjacent non-cancerous tissues (10 pairs) were obtained. MiR-449a was examined in tumor tissues and adjacent nontumorous tissues of breast cancer patients and cell lines by real-time PCR. The protein expression levels were analyzed by western blot and immunohistochemistry staining. Luciferase reporter assays was used to validate the target of miR-449a. The effect of miR-449a on breast cancer cell migration and invasion were studied in vitro and in vivo.The expression levels of miR-449a were significantly decreased in breast cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-449a suppressed breast cancer cell proliferation, clone formation, migration, invasion and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Pleomorphic adenoma gene like-2 (PLAGL2) was identified as a major target of miR-449a. Both overexpression of miR-449a inhibited the expression of PLAGL2 significantly and the knockdown of PLAGL2 expression inhibited the breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis.We demonstrate the miR-449a tumor suppressor role in breast cancer cell migration and invasion via targeting PLAGL2. These findings suggesting that miR-449a/PLAGL2 could serve as a therapeutic strategy for targeting breast cancer.",

The Smad4 and Fascin proteins are known prognostic indicators of different types of malignancy. Smad4 primarily functions as a key regulator of tumor suppression, whereas Fascin exhibits oncogenic function by enhancing tumor infiltration. A combined marker based on these opposing roles may improve prognostic accuracy in gastric cancer.Smad4 and Fascin expression was assessed in tissue microarrays obtained from 285 primary gastric adenocarcinoma, 201 normal tissue, and 51 metastatic adenocarcinoma samples. A Smad4/Fascin index based on the relative expression of each protein was divided into low- and high-expression groups using receiver operating characteristic curves. We compared normal tissue, primary adenocarcinoma, and metastatic adenocarcinoma in Smad4 and Fascin expression and the differences in clinicopathological findings between low Smad4/Fascin and high Smad4/Fascin expression in gastric adenocarcinoma.High Smad4/Fascin expression was significantly associated with worse outcomes, such as old age, advanced T and N category, large tumor size, high histological grade, lymphatic and vascular invasion, and presence of Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) (all p\u202f<\u202f0.05).

The methylation rate of SKI was assessed by quantitative SYBR green methylation-specific PCR, and the degree of SKI expression in tissue specimens was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 10 AIP cases, 14 cases of obstructive pancreatitis area in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) without a history of AIP, and 9 normal pancreas (NP) cases. The SKI methylation ratio was significantly lower in AIP than in PDA and NP. Additionally, the immunohistochemical staining-index (SI) score for SKI was significantly higher in AIP than NP, although there was no significant difference between AIP and PDA. There was a strong negative correlation between SI score and SKI methylation ratio, and between the serum concentrations of IgG4 and the SKI methylation ratio. There was a moderate positive correlation between the serum concentrations of IgG4 and SI. SKI is thought to be an oncogene indicating that SKI hypomethylation and carcinogenesis might be linked to AIP.

Significant differences among the grades (all, P\u202f<\u202f0.01) were found in the following: duration of disease (from onset of clinical manifestation to diagnosis); clinical staging; extranodal involvement (non-lymphoid organs); histological subtype; and Ki-67 proliferation index (PI). After removing the aggressive variants, the overall survival rates of grade I (n\u202f=\u202f92) and II (n\u202f=\u202f57) patients were similar. The overall survival rates of grade III (n\u202f=\u202f46) patients differed from that of grade I\u202f+\u202fII patients (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). The grades negatively correlated with the Ki-67 PI value (r\u202f=\u202f\u22120.234, P\u202f=\u202f0.001). At each grade the OSR of patients with Ki-67 PI \u226430% was similar to that of patients with Ki-67 >30%. In the Ki-67 PI \u226430% group, the OSRs of the patients differed significantly among the grades. In the Ki-67 >30% group the OSRs of the grades were similar. The results of multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the degree of overlap, age and Ki-67 PI was the independent prognostic factors of the OSRs of MCL patients. Our data suggests that MCL patients in whom there was a high degree of overlap between the FDC meshwork and tumor area have a better clinical prognosis. The degree of overlap correlates well with the Ki-67 PI, which can be used to predict the prognosis of patients.",

     "abstract": "Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a well-known humoral protein that induces growth of neurons. Recent studies have suggested that BDNF could act as an angiogenesis inducer similar to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Angiogenin is a strong mediator of angiogenesis. It has particular characteristics both as a secreted protein and a transcription factor. After being incorporated into the cytoplasm, angiogenin is immediately transferred to the nucleus and then mediates the angiogenic effects of angiogenesis inducers, including VEGF. The aim of this study is to determine the association between BDNF and angiogenin. At first, we determined the secretion of angiogenin from human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) induced by BDNF with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Next, we determined BDNF-induced nuclear translocation of angiogenin by immunofluorescent staining. In addition, we examined the mRNA expression of angiogenin in HUVEC before and after BDNF stimulation by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. As a result, we noted that BDNF induced angiogenin secretion and nuclear translocation without an increase in the mRNA expression in HUVEC. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BDNF-induced HUVEC proliferation was significantly suppressed when neomycin, a specific inhibitor of nuclear translocation of angiogenin, was administered. These findings indicate that nuclear translocation of angiogenin is critically involved in BDNF-induced proliferation of HUVEC. In conclusion, angiogenin contributes to angiogenesis induced by BDNF.",

In this study, the roles of Bex1 were explored in the pathophysiology of ICH. Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and immunofluorescence showed that obvious up-regulation of Bex1 in neurons adjacent to the hematoma after ICH. Furthermore, the increase of Bex1 expression was accompanied by the enhanced expression of Bax and active caspase-3, and decreased expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) following ICH. The in vitro study using Bex1 siRNA transfection in hemin-exposed PC12 cells suggested that Bex1 exerted anti-apoptotic function.

Formal IC records from the academic hospital were collected and academic and community pathologists were invited to complete a survey about their IC practices. All centers had a formalized process for documenting ICs; however, 92% of academic and 90% of community pathologists also requested informal IC. The top reasons for selecting a particular colleague for IC was perceived level of expertise; however, interpersonal relationships and office proximity had a greater impact on informal IC practice. Top reasons for requesting a formal IC were mandatory (subspecialty defined) consultation and uncertainty regarding pathological findings. Advice on wording was a common reason for informal IC. Written documentation of IC aids in QA and determination of IC metrics; however, informal, undocumented ICs still occur.

Tissue microarrays were constructed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks. Immunohistochemical staining was performed for E-cadherin, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin to evaluate the EMT status. Interpretation criteria were defined for the staining results and EMT phenotypes were assigned as wild type, incomplete type (loss of E-cadherin and negative for vimentin), and complete type (loss of E-cadherin and positive for vimentin). The loss of E-cadherin and vimentin-expression was observed in 76 (81.7%) and 10 (10.8%) cases, respectively, yielding EMT phenotypes comprised of 17 cases (18.3%) of wild type, 66 cases (71.0%) of incomplete type, and 10 cases (10.8%) of complete types. In survival analyses, wild type showed statistically significant association with longer extra-bladder recurrence free survival (p\u202f<\u202f.001) and overall survival (p\u202f<\u202f.001).

The clinicopathologic features were examined and EGFR and KRAS mutations were tested. Survival of the patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method.The median age of the patients was 64 years (range: 40\u201378). Most patients were male (64.7%) and about half of the patients were at TNM stage III (47.1%). Morphologically, most cases (70.6%) were classic LCC. All patients were treated by lobectomy plus lymph node dissection, 2 with bi-lobectomy and 1 with complex lobectomy, and the other 2 patients were further treated by partial pericardiotomy. Ten patients received postoperative chemotherapy, while only 3 patients were treated with radiotherapy after surgery.

Accurate and reliable detection of these gene fusions is crucial to select the appropriate targeted therapy for each patient.

We found a sensitivity and specificity of 100% for detection of ALK rearrangements using the OFA panel. In addition, targeted next generation sequencing allowed us to analyze a set of 23 driver genes in a single assay. Besides EML4-ALK (11/52 cases), we detected EZR-ROS1 (1/52 cases), KIF5B-RET (1/52 cases) and MET-MET (4/52 cases) fusions. All EML4-ALK, EZR-ROS1 and KIF5B-RET fusions were confirmed by multiplexed targeted next generation sequencing assay (Oncomine Solid Tumor Fusion Transcript Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific). All cases with EML4-ALK rearrangement were confirmed by Alk immunohistochemistry and all but one by ALK FISH. In our experience, targeted next-generation sequencing is a reliable and timesaving tool for multiplexed detection of targetable rearrangements.

There are few studies focusing on its clinical features and limited data about its preoperative diagnosis,treatment and outcomes. The purpose of this study is to explore specific characteristics of patients with IPC, investigate its clinicopathological features, prognosis in China and confirm its surgery management.We identified 111 patients with IPC from the registry of Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital between 2004 and 2017. Follow-up of cases dating back to January 1, 2004 was obtained from retrospective chart review and patient questionnaires. Differences in clinical features and survival of patients were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method.The median tumor size was 2.25\u202fcm. Median age was 62 years. In the cases of axillary lymph node dissection(ALND), only 1.1% (1/85) of patients with axillary lymph node metastasis were found. The diagnostic accuracy of preoperative Color Doppler ultrasound and Mammograms for IPC was 62.0% (62/100) and 63.5% (54/85) respectively. The median follow-up period was 52 (range2\u2013149) months. The overall survival rate was 98.9%, 92.2%,and 85.6% at 2,5,and 10 years and the relapse-free rate was 99.1%,97.2%,and 92.0% at 2,5, and 10 years, respectively. The disease-specific survival rate was 100%.Overall, we report some unique features of IPC in the Chinese population. The patients of IPC of the breast in China have more excellent prognosis than in Caucasian and other races. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging was low, and was easily misinterpreted as a cyst or benign disease. Preoperative core needle biopsies are very difficult for accurate pathological diagnosis of IPC. IPC is a localized disease with a low frequency of axillary lymph node involvement, rare distant metastases and excellent survival. The low incidence of axillary lymph node metastasis suggests that quadrectomy\u202f+\u202fsentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and breast-conserving surgery is recommended for IPC.",

In this study, we demonstrated a prognostic role of YAP1 in EGFR mutant LADC and efficacy of EGFR TKI therapy. A total of 63 patients, including 41 with paired lung cancer specimens before and after EGFR TKI therapy and 22 with non-paired lung cancer specimens prior to EGFR TKI, were enrolled for examination. Expression of YAP1 protein was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Fifteen paired cases (36.6%) with high nuclear YAP1 expression were detected in the pre-EGFR TKI LADC group and 21 paired cases (52.5%) after treatment with EGFR TKI. Nuclear YAP1 expression was significantly upregulated after EGFR TKI therapy (P\u202f=\u202f.002). Fifteen paired cases with high nuclear YAP1 expression before EGFR TKI LADCs showed poorer overall survival (OS) (P\u202f=\u202f.023) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P\u202f=\u202f.041). Among the 63 patients under study, those with high nuclear YAP1 expression before EGFR TKI showed shorter OS (P\u202f=\u202f.038) and PFS (P\u202f<\u202f.001). High nuclear YAP1 expression in cases with acquired EGFR exon 20 T790\u202fM mutant LADCs showed poorer OS (P\u202f<\u202f.001). We demonstrated that YAP1 burden before clinical application of EGFR TKI plays a crucial role in prognosis of EGFR mutant LADC treated using EGFR TKI.",

The aim of this study is to identify EZH2 as a novel and powerful biomarker that can effectively distinguish thymic SqCC from type B3 thymoma, and find optimal combinations among 11 markers. A total of 53 patients, comprising 26 with type B3 thymoma and 27 with thymic SqCC, were allocated to the discovery or validation cohorts, and immunohistochemical staining was performed and analyzed. The expression level of each marker was scored, and receiver-operator characteristic curve analysis was performed to evaluate their diagnostic accuracies. This analysis identified EZH2, C-KIT, and CD205 as useful markers for distinguishing thymic SqCC, and a combined panel approach using them further improved diagnostic accuracy in both the discovery and validation cohorts. In the combined cohorts analysis, EZH2 was the single best marker with 88.9% sensitivity and 100% specificity [area under the curve (AUC)\u202f=\u202f0.967]. The sensitivity and specificity were 85.2% and 100% (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.962) for C-KIT, and 100% and 73.1% (AUC\u202f=\u202f0.844) for CD205. The combined panel had the highest sensitivity and specificity at 96.3% and 100%, which was significantly or marginally higher than those of EZH2, C-KIT, and CD205 alone (P\u202f=\u202f0.071, 0.034, and 0.005, respectively). The present findings indicate that EZH2 is useful as a novel diagnostic marker for distinguishing thymic SqCC and that the panel approach can be used as an effective differential diagnostic tool in daily practice.",

However, the biological function of miR-200c in human carcinogenesis remains controversial. We examined the association of miR-200c expression with various clinicopathological factors, including KRAS mutation status and survival, in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The expression level of miR-200c was evaluated in 109 paired CRC and normal tissue samples using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The KRAS mutation status of the CRC samples was determined using the PNAClamp\u2122 KRAS Mutation Detection kit. Compared with the normal tissue group, miR-200c expression was significantly upregulated in the CRCs (P\u202f<\u202f.001). The expression of miR-200c was increased in CRCs with higher grade (P\u202f=\u202f.009), advanced stage (P\u202f=\u202f.042), and lymphovascular invasion (P\u202f=\u202f.003). Thirty-one CRCs (28.4%) had KRAS mutations in codon 12 or 13. CRCs with KRAS mutations had significantly higher miR-200c expression than CRCs with wild-type KRAS (P\u202f=\u202f.003). In survival analysis, high miR-200c expression was correlated with worse overall survival (P\u202f=\u202f.017) and recurrence-free survival (P\u202f=\u202f.048).

However, we know more about function of miRNA in cancer development, there is still little known about role of their precursors (primary miRNA; pri-miRNA) in tumorgenesis. In present study we investigated potential role of miRNA-944 and its precursor pri-miRNA-944 in development of squamous-cell lung cancer (SCC) and explored interdependence between miRNA precursor and its mature form. This is a first available literature report analyzing pri-miRNA as a cancer diagnostic marker.Expression of miRNA-944 and its precursor was analyzed in 58 fresh-frozen tissues of non-small cell lung cancer and corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissues using qRT-PCR. Expression of pri-miRNA-944 was correlated with TP63 and miRNA-944. Using ROC analysis diagnostic accuracy of studied markers was evaluated.miRNA-944 and its precursor were significantly overexspressed in SCC compared to adenocarcinoma (AC) and non-cancerous tissue. pri-miRNA-944 strongly and positively correlated with TP63 (r\u202f=\u202f0.739, p\u202f<\u202f0.001) and with mature miRNA-944 expression (r\u202f=\u202f0.691, p\u202f<\u202f0.001).

Cytological evaluations and histopathologic examinations were conducted in all subjects, along with the assessment of human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA. The expression levels of the miR-21-5p and miR-34a were detected by RT-PCR. hTERC amplification was detected by dual-color interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

Nevertheless, inconsistent or controversial results exist in some studies. In the present study, we sought to determine the clinical significance of survivin and its potential molecular pathways.The correlation between survivin (BIRC5) expression and diagnostic value, prognostic value and clinicopathological features was assessed by meta-analysis with more than 4000 patients from literature, GEO and TCGA. In addition, the potential molecular mechanism of survivin in ovarian cancer was also determined.The pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.71 (95%CI: 0.68\u20130.74) and 0.97 (95%CI: 0.94\u20130.98), respectively.

Bioinformatics analysis revealed the 50 most frequently altered neighboring genes of survivin in OC, and then Gene Oncology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were conducted. GO analysis showed that these genes were related to signal conduction, cell cycle, apoptosis, and metabolism. KEGG pathways analysis indicated that these genes were primarily enriched in mitotic prometaphase, PLK1 signaling events and the regulation of glucokinase by the glucokinase regulatory protein.Survivin (BIRC5) expression might become a specific but low-sensitivity biomarker in ovarian cancer patients, and its presence indicated poor prognosis and worse TNM stages. This protein might function as an oncoprotein by influencing specific pathways involving the 50 genes identified herein. Additional studies are needed to confirm these results.",

Counting of TB and PDC was performed on H&E slides. High-grade TB (Bd3 (\u226510 tumor buds in 0.785\u202fmm2)) and high-grade PDC (Grade 3 (\u226510)) were found in 20% and 17% of cases respectively.

However, KRAS mutated ADC showed an increased PI compared to EGFR mutated ADC, and ADC with ALK translocations (P\u202f<\u202f0.01). Subgroup analysis of EGFR mutated ADC showed a higher PI for tumors harboring a mutation in exon 18 and 20, compared to tumors with a mutation in exon 19 or 21. A PI of 11.5% was the best possible prognostic stratificator for OS (P\u202f=\u202f0.01 in KRAS mutated and P\u202f<\u202f0.01 in EGFR mutated ADC).In conclusion, the PI differs significantly among ADC with distinct driver mutations. This might explain the varying indications for a prognostic relevance of the PI observed in prior studies. Our study provides a basis for the establishment of a reliable and clinically meaningful PI threshold.",

     "abstract": "The histological definitive diagnosis of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is quite difficult because the morphological features are not specific and no useful immunohistochemical marker has been identified. Loss-of-function mutations in EED or SUZ12, which encode the core subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), were reported in MPNSTs, and the mutations were shown to cause inactivation of PRC2, leading to loss of trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3). Immunohistochemistry of H3K27me3 is expected to be a specific marker for MPNSTs. We evaluated immunohistochemical expression of H3K27me3 in MPNSTs with heterologous components and metachronous cases of MPNSTs. Among 145 MPNST samples, 50 (34.5%) showed complete loss of staining, and 45 (31.0%) showed partial loss of staining. Regarding the backgrounds of MPNSTs, 43 patients of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1)-associated MPNST demonstrated 19 (44.2%) complete and 12 (27.9%) partial loss of H3K27me3. Among MPNSTs with heterologous component, almost all of MPNSTs with epithelioid differentiation (8/9 samples, 88.9%) retained H3K27me3, and malignant Triton tumors without epithelioid component lacked H3K27me3 at high rate (91.7%). Five of 20 metachronous MPNST cases showed significantly reduced expression of H3K27me3 between primary and later-occurring tumors, but in some cases increased expression of H3K27me3 in the clinical course (such as complete loss to partial loss) was observed. If the tumors are recurrent or metastatic, H3K27me3 expression should be reduced or at least maintained because loss of H3K27me3 is due to genetic mutation of EED or SUZ12. MPNSTs, especially those associated with NF-1, can occur in heterochronous and multiple patterns, and the identification of increased expression of H3K27me3 during a patient\u2019s clinical course can be helpful for determining whether the tumors are heterochronous, multiple or not. As heterochronous and multiple tumors may show lower malignancy compared to recurrent or metastatic tumors, favorable prognosis may be expected when H3K27me3 expression is increased.",

A newly recognized marker in the routine diagnostic of a mucinous neoplasm in the ovary is SATB2 (Special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2). The expression of SATB2 is, within cells of epithelial lineages, mainly restricted to the lower gastro-intestinal tract, indicating colorectal or appendiceal cancer origin.

An immunohistochemical marker-panel including SATB2, CDX2, CK20, CK7, PAX8, ER and PR revealed a strong expression of SATB2 in all seven cases. On the contrary SATB2-negativity could be demonstrated in the 40 cases of mucinous borderline tumors and primary mucinous carcinomas of the ovary. The histopathologic tentative diagnosis of an ovarian metastasis of LAMN could be confirmed in the findings of the Appendix in six of seven cases.

This study aims to investigate the clinicopathological features of low-grade malignant ELSTs.The clinicopathological data of 21 patients with low-grade malignant ELSTs were collected and analyzed.The patients were aged 16\u201371 years, with an average age of 40.3 years and a median age of 39 years, and the male to female ratio was 1:1.6. There were 13 cases (61.9%) of ELSTs occurring on the left side, 7 cases (33.3%) on the right side, and 1 case (4.8%) on both sides. Blood types O and B were noted in 71.4% of the patients. Immunohistochemistry showed that CK, EMA and Vim were all positive, and S-100 (71.4%, 10/14), CD56 (75.0%, 9/12), NSE (50.0%, 2/4), and GFAP (11.1%, 1/9) were also positive, while Syn, CgA, TTF-1, TG, CD34, and calcitonin were negative. The Ki-67 index was 4.3% on average. Histologically, cells were arranged in a papillary shape often with branches and abundant fibrous axial vessel. Some cells had an expanded different-sized thyroid-follicle-like structure, with the follicles containing red-stained colloids and scallop-like secretary vacuoles. There were expanded cavities. Some cases were in a glandular arrangement, and a few in a nest-like, gland-cystoid arrangement. Most tumors were coated with a monolayer of cubic epithelium, a few cells were flat or columnar, with translucent cytoplasm and light staining. The nuclei were oval, nucleolus was not obvious, chromatin was delicate, and a few nucleoli were small. The tissue was prone to bleeding, with fresh and old bleeding. Approximately half of the patients had necrotic bones, and in some cases the tumor tissue had destroyed the surrounding bone. The background fibrous tissue showed hyperplasia with hyaline degeneration, some had calcification and formation of sandy-gravel bodies. The clinical manifestations were hearing reduction or loss, followed by tinnitus, and accompanied by varying degrees of cranial nerve injury. No patients died during follow-up.Low-grade malignant ELSTs occur most frequently on the left side, with a female preponderance. The disease progressed slowly, with no death, and but relapse in two patients in this series. These tumors are often misdiagnosed.",

The purpose of the present study was to screen the key genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and to investigate the functions underlying hepatocellular carcinoma progression.The gene expression profile of GSE64041, GSE40367 and GSE60502, including 100 specimens from HCC patients and 92 specimens from normal liver controls, was downloaded from the GEO database. DEGs were screened using the online analysis tool from the GCBI website and validated by Q-PCR and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. After knockdown by siRNA in HepG2/C3A and Bel7402 HCC cells, the CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay were used to measure the clonogenic capacity of the tumor cells. Western blotting assay was used to measure the expression of PTEN.Five up-regulated genes were identified as overlapping genes associated with tumor cell activation. Upon validation by Q-PCR and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, CKS2 was selected for further study. Although the results of CCK-8 did not show a significant difference, the colony formation assay results indicated that the silencing of CKS2 significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation. Further study found that CKS2 knockdown induced PTEN up-regulation and may associate with P53 pathway activation.These findings indicated that CKS2 play a role in tumor activation and serve as a useful potential target for the treatment of HCC.",

Therefore, we assume that the inhibition of \u03b2-catenin can enhanced the efficacy of taxol. The purpose of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of miR-200a mimics, FH535 combined with taxol on proliferation and invasion of human gastric cancer cell lines SGC-7901 and BGC-823. In the current study, we identified that the combination of FH535 and miR-200a with taxol had potent growth-inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects. Further, similar results were also observed in vivo, intratumoral injection of FH535, taxol and miR-200a mimics which also delayed tumor growth in nude mice harboring subcutaneous SGC-7901 xenografts. Collectively, miR-200a and FH535 can enhance the inhibitory effect of taxol on cell proliferation and moderate the invasion of human gastric cancer.",

The 32 types of mutations in exons 18\u201321 of the EGFR gene were detected. The total EGFR mutation rate among patients with lung adenocarcinoma was 56.9%. The mutation rates were 71.2% among females and 42.8% among males (P\u202f<\u202f0.05). Among patients with TNM stage I, II, III, and IV disease, the EGFR mutation rates were significant differences (P\u202f<\u202f0.05).

In one of the cases, CD10 and CD56 were expressed by the luminal membrane of parathyroid cells. CD31 was expressed in interparathyroid cell monocyte/macrophage membrane as well as CD68, several cells showing also CD10 and/or CD56 expression. Ki67 was expressed in sparse parathyroid cells, some of binucleated cells or with nuclear clumps.In conclusion, heterogeneous E-cadherin expression in parathyroid cells may only indirectly related to cyst formation while CD56 and CD10 seem not to relate at all.

Therefore, we evaluated the expression and correlation of ANXA1, FPR and cyclooxygenase\u22122 (COX\u22122) enzyme in esophageal and stomach inflammations and neoplasias. The study of proteins was performed by immunohistochemistry in biopsies of esophagitis, Barrett's esophagus, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, as well as gastritis, stomach polypus and gastric adenocarcinoma. The intensity of the expressions was evaluated by densitometry. The immunohistochemical and densitometric analyzes showed specificity for the FPR1 receptor and modulation of the ANXA1, COX\u22122 and FPR1 expressions in the epithelial cells in the different studied conditions. Increased immunoreactivity of these proteins was observed in cases of inflammation and stomach polypus. Interestingly, moderate immunoreactivity for ANXA1 and FPR1 but increased immunolabeling for COX\u22122 were observed in Barrett\u0301s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinomas. Also, there was reduced expression of ANXA1 and FPR1 in esophageal carcinoma but COX\u22122 overexpression in this tumor. There was no expression of FPR2 but ANXA1 and FPR1 expressions were positively correlated in all clinical conditions studied. Positive correlation between ANXA1 and COX\u22122 were also observed in inflammation conditions while negative correlation between ANXA1 and COX\u22122 was observed in esophageal carcinoma. Our results demonstrate the unregulated expression of ANXA1 and COX\u22122 in precursor lesions of esophageal and stomach cancers, reinforcing their involvement in gastroesophageal carcinogenesis. In addition, the data show that the actions of ANXA1 in the inflammatory and neoplastic processes of the esophagus and stomach are specifically mediated by the FPR1 receptor.",

Protein expression was analyzed in relation to platinum response groups, tumour progression, clinicopathological data and survival.Positive IKK2 expression was related to resistance (p\u202f=\u202f0.011), shorter disease-free survival (p\u202f=\u202f0.001) and overall survival (p\u202f=\u202f0.026) and was also a risk factor for relapse (p\u202f=\u202f0.002) and death (p\u202f=\u202f0.032). The association between IKK2 and NF-\u03baB positivity predicted a subgroup with shorter overall survival (p\u202f=\u202f0.004), disease-free survival (p\u202f=\u202f0.003) and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy (p\u202f=\u202f0.036).

Continuous variable meta-analysis and diagnostic meta-analysis were conducted, both in Stata 14, to show the expression of miR-1 in ccRCC. Furthermore, we acquired the potential targets of miR-1 from datasets that transfected miR-1 into ccRCC cells, online prediction databases, differentially expressed genes from TCGA and literature. Subsequently bioinformatics analysis based on aforementioned selected target genes was conducted.The combined effect was \u22120.92 with the 95% confidence interval (CI) of \u22121.08 to \u22120.77 based on fixed effect model (I2\u202f=\u202f81.3%, P\u202f<\u202f0.001).

In addition, cases with or without detectable necrosis were investigated for differences in clinical outcome.Overall survival was highest in the group with Hodgkin-like morphology (4/4 patients), followed by patients with mononucleosis-like phenotype (4/5 patients surviving). Cases with polymorphous morphology showed the poorest survival rates with 7/12 patients dead of disease (58%). 4/6 patients with histologically detectable necrosis died (66%), but only 4/15 patients without necrosis (27%). 11/21 cases with AELPD showed clonal rearrangement for IgH (n\u202f=\u202f4), TCR (n\u202f=\u202f5) or IgH\u202f+\u202fTCR (n\u202f=\u202f2). 5/11 patients with clonal rearrangement died (45%), and this percentage was similar in all of the three subgroups.In conclusion, the present study shows that polymorphous morphology and detection of necrosis in AELPD are frequently linked to a fatal clinical course, whereas Hodgkin-like morphology seems to be associated with a more favourable prognosis. Clonal rearrangement of IgH or TCR is frequent in AELPD, but prognosis is unpredictable from this feature.",

A T cell transfer model of chronic colitis was induced by intraperitoneal injection of CD4+CD45RBhigh naive T cells isolated from either C57BL/6 wild type (WT) mice or LCK-CD2-Tl1a-GFP transgenic (L-Tg) mice into recombinase activating gene-1-deficient (RAG\u2212/\u2212) mice.

     "abstract": "Breast carcinoma with osteoclast-like giant cells (OGCs) is a rare tumor; however, their clinicopathological aspects remain unclear. We described the clinicopathological characteristics of 8 patients with breast carcinoma with OGCs. Immuno-phenotypes of the OGCs were comparatively examined with that of foreign body giant cells (FBGCs) in 4 cases of granulomatous reaction (GR) without cancerous elements. In most cancers, tumors displayed cribriform and tubular growth patterns. Three cases showed moderate to high nuclear grade, while all the other tumors had low nuclear grade. Six patients were estrogen receptor (ER) positive, while triple negative phenotype was identified in 2 patients. During the follow-up period, 1 patient had local recurrence of the tumor, and all the patients remained alive. All OGCs and FBGCs expressed CD68, a pan-macrophage marker. OGCs in all the breast cancers showed moderate to high expression of CD163 \u2014 a marker of M2-macrophage with pro-tumoral function \u2014 whereas its expression in FBGCs was low to moderate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). CD86 \u2014 a marker of M1-macrophage with a tumoricidal activity \u2014 was positive in the OGCs of 3 breast cancers, and in the FBGCs of 3 GR cases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.15). The expression of CD163 was significantly higher than that of CD86 in the OGCs of breast cancer (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), whereas they were comparable in the FBGCs of GR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.79). In summary, we found that breast carcinoma with OGCs mostly exhibited cribriform and tubular growth pattern, ER positivity, and predominantly possessed the M2-macrophage phenotype. However, the clinical significance of OGCs in breast cancer needs to be elucidated in further studies involving a larger number of cases.",

Temsirolimus, everolimus, resveratrol, curcumin and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were the mTOR inhibitors assessed. The 50% cell cytotoxicity rate (CC50) for each treatment was determined by MTT cell viability assay. Cells were pre-treated with mTOR inhibitors at CC50 followed by radiotherapy (RT) at 2\u202fGy. Cell death profile after treatment with temsirolimus, resveratrol and curcumin was assessed with flow cytometry. Everolimus, temsirolimus, EGCG, resveratrol and curcumin were cytotoxic to HeLa. Radiation induced a statistically significant (p\u202f<\u202f0.01) supra-additive cytotoxic effect in the cervical cancer cell line when combined with mTOR inhibitors. After a 24-h treatment, EGCG and resveratrol were more cytotoxic to HeLa cells than to HaCaT cells. After 48\u202fh of treatment, resveratrol, curcumin and everolimus were more cytotoxic to HeLa cells when compared to HaCaT cells. After 24\u202fh, temsirolimus induced late apoptosis or necrosis in HeLa cells.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genes can lead to alteration in mRNA expression, resulting in serious consequences. Detection of miRNA-polymorphisms can potentially improve diagnosis, treatment, prognosis in patients and has extreme implications in the fields of pharmacogenomics and personalization of medicine. The aim of this study is to investigate the association between miR-499 A/G and miR-149 C/T polymorphisms with susceptibility to development of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC). 200 histopathologically diagnosed and confirmed samples from OSCC patients and 200 control samples from the general population were recruited for the study. All OSCC patients were graded based on their differentiation, and genetic analysis was performed by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. qRT-PCR was carried out to compare the expression of miR-499 and miR-149 in different grades of various stages of OSCC patients concerning to the controls. Further Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to study the target gene of miR-499. The study shows a probable association of miR-499 A/G and miR-149 C/T with susceptibility of OSCC. Random sequencing analysis and Immunohistochemistry contribute to the result that miR-499 A/G increases the susceptibility of OSCC by targeting SOX-6. PCR- Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) and multivariable logistic analysis revealed that there is a significant association between miR-149 CT\u00a0+\u00a0TT and CT and susceptibility of OSCC.

Then the protein was knocked down using siRNA against PINCH-1 and change in percentage of apoptotic cells was analysed by flow cytometry.We observed increased but differential expression of PINCH-1 in the three breast cancer cell lines with a higher expression in estrogen positive cell lines. Knocking down of PINCH-1 led to a significant (p-value\u202f<\u202f0.05) enhancement in apoptosis in T47D cells in response to 4/6 (cyclophosphamide, celecoxib, paclitaxel, doxorubicin) drugs. Though an increase in apoptosis was observed in MCF-7 cells also, it was not found to be significant.The MDA-MB-231 cells however, did not show significant apoptosis upon PINCH-1 knockdown.The results suggest that PINCH-1 may be playing an important role in etiopathogenesis of both subtypes breast cancer. However, enhanced apoptosis observed only in estrogen positive and not in estrogen negative cells upon PINCH-1 knockdown point towards participation of some other protein with redundant functions in the later subtype which needs to be investigated.",

Histologically, relatively well-differentiated osteosarcoma was found in the FD lesion. Immunohistochemically, the FD was negative for p53 or MDM2, and the MIB-1 index was less than 1%, whereas the osteosarcoma was positive for both p53 and MDM2, and the MIB-1 index was up to 15%. The FD and osteosarcoma were negative for CDK4. Fluorescent in situ hybridization assay showed no amplification of the MDM2 gene, indicating that the osteosarcoma was a conventional osteosarcoma, not an intraosseous well-differentiated type. The original cell of malignancy in FD is unclear. Malignancy can be potentially derived from dysplastic cells in the area of the FD or cells in the adjacent normal tissues. GNAS gene mutation has recently been reported for fibrous dysplasia and the mutation is highly specific to fibrous dysplasia among fibro-osseous lesions including osteosarcoma.In this case, point mutations of GNAS were found in the FD and osteosarcoma but not in the adjacent normal tissues, suggesting that osteosarcoma was derived from the spindle cells of FD.

Generally, two 1\u202fmm punches were taken from the tumor bud areas in the periphery (PTB) and within the tumor center (ITB). HR and Her2 status was assessed using immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization, respectively. HR status was positive if \u22651% of tumor bud cells were positive. Her2 status was considered positive if bud cells showed strong complete membranous Her2 over-expression or Her2 amplification.Most tumor buds were positive for estrogen (ER) (PTB: 86%; ITB: 88.3) and progesterone receptor (PgR) (PTB: 72%; ITB: 72.8%) and Her2 was positive in: PTB 11.5% and ITB 11%. A difference between the main tumor mass and tumor buds (PTB and ITB) was seen for PgR in 3.5% of cases (n\u202f=\u202f7). No differences were seen for ER and Her2 between tumor buds and main tumor mass.Most tumor buds (96.5%) share the same HR and Her2 expression profile of the main tumor mass, implying that tumor buds relay on the same pathways as the main tumor mass and might be equally responsive to targeted therapies.",

Evidence suggests an important role of leptin in carcinogenesis pathways, inducing a proliferative phenotype. We investigated the potential of gallic acid to modulate leptin-induced cell proliferation and migration of oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. The gallic acid effect on leptin secretion by oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, was also assessed. For this, we performed proliferation, migration, immunocytochemical and qPCR assays. The expression levels of cell migration-related genes (MMP2, MMP9, Col1A1, and E-cadherin), angiogenesis (HIF-1\u03b1, mir210), leptin signaling (LepR, p44/42 MAPK), apoptosis (casp-3), and secreted leptin levels by oral squamous cell carcinoma cells were also measured. Gallic acid decreased proliferation and migration of leptin-treated oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, and reduced mRNA expression of MMP2, MMP9, Col1A1, mir210, but did not change HIF-1\u03b1. Gallic acid decreased levels of leptin secreted by oral squamous cell carcinoma cells, accordingly with downregulation of p44/42 MAPK expression. Thus, gallic acid appears to break down neoplastic phenotype of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by interfering with leptin pathway.",

However, the ultrastructural features of subchondral bone in osteoporosis OA have not been determined. The study was aimed to investigate the ultrastructural dynamic changes of subchondral bone in osteoporotic OA model and how the ultrastructural damage in the subchondral bone caused by osteoporosis deteriorated the cartilage damage in OA. Eighteen rabbits were equally randomized to three groups, including the control, the OA and the osteoporotic OA groups. The structural changes of cartilage were evaluated by HE and safranin-O fast green staining, the Mankin\u2019s grading system was used to assess the stage of OA progression. And microstructural or ultrastructural changes in subchondral bone were assessed by micro-computed tomography or by scanning electron microscopy. According to the changes of cartilage histopathology, the OA group was in the early pathological stage of OA while the osteoporotic OA group was in the middle stage of OA based on Mankin\u2019s grading system. In addition, the damage of cartilage surface, reduction in the number of chondrocytes and the matrix staining were more increased in the osteoporotic OA group compared to the OA group. Compared to the OA group, the subchondral bone in the microstructure and ultrastructure in the osteoporotic OA group showed more microfracture changes in trabecular bone with more destructions of the tree-like mesh. Moreover, the collagen fibers were random rough with a fewer amount of bone lacunae in subchondral cortical plate in the osteoporotic OA group compared to the OA group. These findings indicated that the subchondral bone ultrastructure in the osteoporotic OA model was characterized by the destruction of the network structure and collagen fibers. The subchondral bone ultrastructural damage caused by osteoporosis may change mechanical properties of the upper cartilage and aggravate OA cartilage. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis is of great significance to prevent early OA from further developing osteoporotic OA.",

The aim of present meta-analysis was to explore the associations between CYP24A1 polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility.We searched on EMBASE, Web of Science, PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) electronic databases (up to July 1, 2017) for relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to make the evaluation clear.Twenty-nine studies published in eight publications involving 20,593 cases and 25,458 controls were included. Five CYP24A1 gene polymorphisms were evaluated: rs2181874, rs2585428, rs4809960, rs6022999, and rs6068816. Our analyses suggested that rs2585428 and rs4809960 polymorphisms were significantly associated with overall cancer risk. Stratification analyses of ethnicity indicated that rs2585428 and rs4809960 polymorphisms decreased the risk of cancer among Caucasians.

CD68 and double immunostaining with CD20/CyclinD1, CD68/CyclinD1, and CD163/CyclinD1 were then performed in cases of CLL/SLL positive for cyclinD1 in the PCs.Dim-positive cyclin D1 staining in randomly scattered cells in the CLL/SLLs were observed in 38/46 cases (82.6%). In five (10.9%) cases, more than 50 cyclin D1-positive cells per high-power field were detected within the PCs in CLL/SLL with weak to moderate intensity. Double immunochemical staining in these cases showed that cyclin D1 in these positive cells was mostly co-expressed with CD68 and CD163 and the cells were negative for CD20.The cyclin D1-positive CLL/SLL cells in this study were mostly histiocytes.

DVIN represents a diagnostic challenge; poor inter-observer agreement is well documented. P53 has been described as a potentially helpful adjunct in some cases; however, intricacies in its interpretation remain. This study evaluated 41 consecutive cases which consisted of 23 keratinizing dysplasias that were morphologically suggestive of DVIN and 18 UVINs. All cases were stained with p16 and p53. Our results revealed that 22 of 41 (54%) VINs showed novel accentuated wild type (WT) staining with non-linear basal staining for p53, including 12 (52%) cases histologically suggestive of DVIN and 10 (56%) described as UVIN. P16 was positive in 100% of the accentuated wild type cases, consistent with a diagnosis of UVIN. Positive p53 and negative p16 staining was seen in 4 (17%) cases histologically suggestive of DVIN. Of these, 75% progressed to carcinoma, whereas only 1 of 35 (3%) patients with UVIN progressed to carcinoma. In conclusion, DVIN is difficult to diagnose due to potential histologic overlap with UVIN, especially the warty, or keratinizing, subtype. Accentuated WT p53 in absence of concurrent p16 staining may lead to misdiagnosis of DVIN, especially in small biopsy samples. P16/p53 staining should be performed in tandem with strict adherence to patterns considered positive, as patients with UVIN have significantly less risk of progression.",

We hypothesized that promoter methylation could be responsible for PAQR3 silencing in prostate cancer tissues. We aimed to investigate PAQR3 promoter methylation in prostate cancer by comparing it to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). A total of 154 human prostate tissue samples, including 92 cases with prostate cancer and 62 cases with BPH, were examined by methylation-specific PCR. Clinicopathological correlation between PAQR3 promoter methylation and prognostically relevant variables was studied by statistical analysis. Promoter methylation of PAQR3 was significantly more frequent in prostate carcinoma compared to BPH (73.9% vs. 25.8%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The high prevalence of PAQR3 methylation in cancer foci was also confirmed with microdissection technique in 12 samples of prostate adenocarcinoma.

     "abstract": "Detection of Epstein-Barr virus in oral squamous cell carcinoma suggests its involvement in the carcinogenesis of oral cavity. But, there are few studies on the incidence of EBV genome in squamous cell carcinomas at specific locations in the oral cavity like tongue and with different tumor progression. In this study the presence of EBV genome in tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma (TSCC) in Iranian patients were investigated. Accordingly, a total of 94 cases with TSCC were firstly analyzed for the presence of viral genome through Nested PCR. Patients were divided into different groups based on their gender and the size, nodal involvement, grade and stage of their tumor. Results showed the presence of EBV genome in 72.3% of TSCCs with no significant difference between two genders, although slightly higher in females. Interestingly, PCR products of EBV genome showed a statistically significant higher distribution in TSCCs at IVa stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), while a considerable low involvement of EBV genome was seen in T1-sized tumors. The result of this study further emphasizes the role of EBV in oral SCCs \u2013 mainly at tongue. This is the first investigation to clarify the association between EBV genome and different tumor size and stage in TSCCs; however, more studies in different regions and larger populations should be performed to be able to draw a firmed conclusion.",

     "abstract": "Dysregulation of DNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) is associated with the pathogenesis of various types of cancer. It has been previously shown that DNMT1 is frequently expressed in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), however its functions remain to be elucidated in the disease. In this study, we gene expression profiled (GEP) shRNA targeting DNMT1(shDNMT1)-treated germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL)-derived cell line (i.e. HT) compared with non-silencing shRNA (control shRNA)-treated HT cells. Independent gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) performed using GEPs of shRNA-treated HT cells and primary GCB-DLBCL cases derived from two publicly-available datasets (i.e. GSE10846 and GSE31312) produced three separate lists of enriched gene sets for each gene sets collection from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB). Subsequent Venn analysis identified 268, 145 and six consensus gene sets from analyzing gene sets in C2 collection (curated gene sets), C5 sub-collection [gene sets from gene ontology (GO) biological process ontology] and Hallmark collection, respectively to be enriched in positive correlation with DNMT1 expression profiles in shRNA-treated HT cells, GSE10846 and GSE31312 datasets [false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05]. Cell cycle progression and DNA replication were among the significantly enriched biological processes (FDR <0.05). Expression of genes involved in the activation of cell cycle and DNA replication (e.g. CDK1, CCNA2, E2F2, PCNA, RFC5 and POLD3) were highly correlated (r\u00a0>0.8) with DNMT1 expression and significantly downregulated (log fold-change <\u22121.35; p\u00a0<0.05) following DNMT1 silencing in HT cells. These results suggest the involvement of DNMT1 in the activation of cell cycle and DNA replication in DLBCL cells.",

A total of 80 patients with hepatitis B virus-associated HCC, 35 patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), and 20 healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. MethyLight was used to quantitatively assess the methylation levels of serum IGFBP7 promoter. A logistic regression model was established for the combined evaluation of AFP and serum IGFBP7 promoter methylation. The results showed that mean methylation levels of serum IGFBP7 promoter were significantly higher in HCC (5.33%, interquartile range [IQR] 1.14\u201315.70%) patients than in individuals with CHB (1.54%, IQR 0.64\u20132.45%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and HC (0.63%, IQR 0.22\u20130.98%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In HCC subgroups, patients with vascular invasion, tumor size >3\u00a0cm and advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) showed higher methylation levels compared with the remaining groups (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared with AFP alone, combined determination based on logistic regression analysis significantly improved the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) (0.759 vs 0.623, P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In addition, the Youden index was increased from 5.71%, 11.25% and 15.18%, when considering AFP alone at cut-off values of 20, 200, and 400\u00a0ng/ml, respectively, to 45.71% with IGFBP7 promoter methylation taken into consideration (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

BALB/c mice were selected for establishing mice model of UC, and intestinal tissues of normal and UC mice were collected. ELISA was conducted for detecting levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10. The levels of SOD, MPO, MDA and NO were tested in the intestinal tissues. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was applied to determine whether miR-495 directly targets STAT3. Cells were cultured, transfected and assigned into: normal group, blank group, NC group, miR-495 mimic group, miR-495 inhibitor group, siRNA-STAT3 group and miR-495 inhibitor\u00a0+\u00a0siRNA-STAT3 group. MTT was used for testing cell proliferation, flow cytometry for cell cycle and apoptosis. Northern blotting and Western blotting were performed to detect miR-495 expression and expressions of STAT3, JAK and Claudin-1. Results show that the UC group had higher expression levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3, MPO, MDA, NO, STAT3 and JAK and lower expression levels of IL-10, SOD, miR-495 and Claudin-1, compared to the normal group. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed that STAT3 was the target gene of miR-495. The miR-495 mimic and siRNA-STAT3 groups had higher expressions of Claudin-1, higher cell proliferation and increased amount of cells in S phase, but lower expressions of STAT3 and JAK, decreased amount of cells in G0/G1 phase and cell apoptotic rate compared with the blank, NC groups. We also found that the miR-495 inhibitor\u00a0+\u00a0siRNA-STAT3 group had reduced miR-495 expression. No significant differences were found in mRNA and protein expressions of STAT3, JAK and Claudin-1, cell proliferation, apoptosis and cycle amongst the miR-495 inhibitor\u00a0+\u00a0siRNA-STAT3 groups. Our study provides evidence that miR-495 improves the intestinal mucosal barrier function by targeting STAT3 through inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway in UC mice.",

Genotyping was conducted on the basis of the ligase detection reaction (LDR). The expressions of XIAP polymorphisms were detected. The patients were followed up every three months until death or the last follow-up day. The overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) were recorded by Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and the relationship between XIAP gene polymorphism and risk and prognosis of ESCC was assessed by Cox multivariate analysis.TT\u202f+\u202fCT genotype and T allele frequencies of XIAP rs8371 and rs9856 in the case group were significantly lower compared to those of the control group (all P\u202f<\u202f0.05), suggesting that TT\u202f+\u202fCT genotype of XIAP rs8371 and rs9856 was associated with ESCC susceptibility.

A number of different methods and platforms including pyrosequencing (PSQ), quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) and immunohistochemistry (IHC), methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM) and NGS (Next Generation Sequencing) have been used to detect MGMT promoter methylation in gliomas. However, controversy remains about the most appropriate method to use for analyzing MGMT status. The MGMT promoter methylation status of a total of 350 gliomas and gangliogliomas was examined using PSQ, qMSP and IHC in parallel. Using PSQ as a recommended standard method, the sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value and correlation with the other assays were calculated. Among 350 glioma and ganglioglioma cases, the MGMT promoter tested positive for methylation in 53.1%, 55.4%, and 70.3% of the cases by PSQ, qMSP and IHC, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of qMSP were 97.8% and 92.7%, respectively. Twelve cases that tested positive for methylation using qMSP were negative according to PSQ, and four cases that were negative according to qMSP tested positive according to PSQ. The concordance rate between PSQ and qMSP was 90.8%. The sensitivity and specificity of IHC for the detection of MGMT at the protein level were 84.4% and 45.7%, respectively. The concordance rate between PSQ and IHC was 30.8%.This study demonstrated that qMSP is an effective and rapid detection method for routine use in pathology laboratories for the identification of MGMT promoter methylation. A combination of IHC and qMSP assays can provide high sensitivity and specificity for the prediction of MGMT status. A few cases that tested negative with PSQ did harbor MGMT promoter methylation, as confirmed by qMSP and sequencing, and this subgroup of patients may benefit from temozolomide.",

To determine if the HER2 overexpression is associated with the prognostically unfavorable traditional clinicopathological features in this group of breast cancers, clinicopathological features (age, tumor size, histological type, histological grade, nodal status, hormone receptor status, proliferation index, lymphovascular invasion, ploidy) of 38 HER2 positive T1a,b cancers were compared with those of the control group consisting of 315 HER2 negative T1a,b cancers. The comparison of clinicopathological features was made using \u03c72 and t-test. HER2 positive T1a,b breast cancers were significantly associated with higher tumor grades (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), negative hormone receptors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), presence of lymphovascular invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025), high proliferation index (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and abnormal DNA content (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

Beyond basic dimensions and volume calculations, tumor morphometry is an area that has received little attention, as it requires the analysis of the prostate gland and tumor foci in three-dimensions. Previous efforts to generate three-dimensional prostate models have required specialised graphics units and focused on the spatial distribution of tumors for optimisation of biopsy strategies rather than to generate novel morphometric variables such as tumor surface area. Here, we aimed to develop a method of creating three-dimensional models of a prostate\u2019s pathological state post radical prostatectomy that allowed the derivation of surface areas and volumes of both prostate and tumors, to assess the method\u2019s accuracy to known clinical data, and to perform initial investigation into the utility of morphometric variables in prostate cancer prognostication. Serial histology slides from 21 prostatectomy specimens covering a range of tumor sizes and pathologies were digitised. Computer generated three-dimensional models of tumor and prostate space filling models were reconstructed from these scanned images using Rhinoceros 4.0 spatial reconstruction software. Analysis of three-dimensional modelled prostate volume correlated only moderately with weak concordance to that from the clinical data (r\u202f=\u202f0.552, \u03b8\u202f=\u202f0.405), but tumor volume correlated well with strong concordance (r\u202f=\u202f0.949, \u03b8\u202f=\u202f0.876).

Recently, the monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody Necitumumab in combination with gemcitabine and cisplatin was approved (EMA/14106/2016) for first-line treatment of squamous non-small cell carcinoma (SqNSCLC). Eligibility was restricted to cases with positive EGFR expression. In this context, a ring trial of the Quality Assurance Initiative for Pathology (QuIP\u00ae) was launched to prepare the German pathology community for a reliable and reproducible, immunohistochemically based biomarker test.The trial was set up by a three-step approach. Two lead institutes were nominated to organize the trial process and to select appropriate cancer samples. These were first tested by the H-score (range 0\u2013300) to identify positive and negative cases. Seven additional pathology institutes with experience in EGFR immunohistochemistry each tested the selected panel of identical cases (internal ring trial) to confirm the suitability of samples and scoring criteria. Then the open ring trial for all institutes of pathology in German speaking countries was announced.For the internal trial 8 EGFR-positive and 2 negative lung sqNSCLC samples were selected. A cut-off value of cell membranous staining in\u00a0\u2265\u00a01% of tumor cells was introduced to define a case as EGFR negative or positive. Two points were attainable per correctly assessed sample leading to a maximum of 20 points,\u00a0\u2265\u00a018 points were required for a successful participation. All 7 panel institute passed this barrier, 5 with the maximum of 20 points and two with one error (18 points) being related to one case with incorrect interpretation of cytoplasmic versus membranous staining and one case with an H-score of 2 as being considered EGFR positive. A second cut-off value (H-score\u00a0\u2265\u00a03) was therefore introduced. In the open ring trial, 34 institutions participated of which 28 were successful according to the above criteria. The trial revealed a high reproducibility despite the use of different EGFR antibodies and detection systems. There was no association between technical parameters and trial failure. Again, one participant misinterpreted the subcellular EGFR localization.The first nationwide ring test for determination of EGFR IHC expression in sqNSCLC could be successfully performed in a very tight time frame. By this, the national pathology community was prepared to incorporate this marker in the panel of predictive cancer tests in a quality assessed manner and to initiate and accompany future studies on EGFR pathway pathology.",

However, the role of LAPTM4B in HCC tumorigenesis and progression has not been clearly determined. The present study demonstrated that the mRNA as well as the protein levels of LAPTM4B were significantly upregulated in HCC specimens. Patients with higher levels of LAPTM4B mRNA in their HCC tissues tended to be of a younger age, HBsAg+, with an advanced Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage. Moreover, LAPTM4B mRNA expression was positively associated with serum \u03b1 \u2212fetoprotein levels. We also observed that LAPTM4B was able to promote HCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro.

The Bmi-1 protein expressions in GIST and adjacent normal tissues were detected using immunohistochemistry and further analyzed by using photodensitometry. To monitor and track the progression of the GIST, a 3-year follow-up was conducted for all affected patients. After cell transfection, the GIST cells were assigned into the control group (without transfection), the negative control (NC) group (transfected with Bmi-1-Scramble plasmid), and the Bmi-1 shRNA group (transfected with the pcDNA3.1-Bmi-1 shRNA plasmid). Protein and mRNA expressions collected from Bmi-1, p16lnk4A, P14ARF, cyclin D1, and CDK4 were measured using both the RT-qPCR and western blotting methods Cell senescence was assessed and obtained by using the \u03b2-Galactosidase (\u03b2-Gal) activity assay. The use of a Soft agar colony formation assay and CCK-8 assay were performed in order to detect the cell growth and subsequent proliferation. Cell invasion and migration were analyzed using the Transwell assay and scratch test.Bmi-1 in the GIST tissues was found to be significantly higher and the p16lnk4A and P14ARF expressions were lower than those in the adjacent normal tissues. Bmi-1 was negatively correlated with p16lnk4A and P14ARF expressions according to the correlation analysis. Bmi-1 expression was associated with the TNM stage, postoperative recurrence, metastasis, tumor size, and the 5-year survival rate. Area under ROC curve was calculated at 0.884, and sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of Bmi-1 predicting the GIST were 67.44%, 97.67%, and 65.12%, respectively. Patients exhibiting a high Bmi-1 expression in the GIST tissues had lower survival rates than those with low Bmi-1 expression. In comparison with the control group, P14ARF, and p16lnk4A were up-regulated, while cyclinD 1 and CDK4 were down-regulated, cell senescence was promoted, and cell proliferation, invasion, and migration also showed some regression in the Bmi-1 shRNA group.These collection of data indicated that the down-regulated Bmi-1 might inhibit the proliferation, invasion, and migration of GIST cells and can be subsequently linked to the incidence and developing a prognosis of GIST.",

Previously studies found that TAPP2 is highly expressed in primary leukemic B cells that have strong migratory capacity. However, the function and underlying mechanisms of TAPP2 in ESCC remain largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the level of TAPP2 in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and in corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blot analyses. TAPP2 protein level was increased in ESCC tissues compared with corresponding adjacent non-tumor tissues. In vitro experiments showed that under-expression of TAPP2 reduced ESCC cell TE1 migration by wound-healing assays and transwell migration assays, and it was concurrent with the decreased expression of the phosphorylation of AKT. Taken together, these findings suggested that TAPP2 serves as oncogenic gene in ESCC and may serve as a new target for ESCC therapy.",

Epigenetic regulation of CSTB was examined by demethylation, deacetylation tests and bisulfite sequencing (BS). In primary lung and colorectal tumors, the protein expression of CSTB was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarray.CSTB was downregulated in lung cancer cell lines on mRNA and protein levels compared to human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC). In colon cancer cell lines, CSTB was weakly expressed in Caco2, CX2 and HCT-16 and highly expressed in HT-29, WiDr, SW480 and HRT-18 on mRNA level compared to normal colonic fibroblast cells CCD33Co. After treatment with demethylation agent 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine, increased CSTB mRNA expression was found in 7 out of 11 lung cancer cell lines including H226, H157, H2170, H1299, COLO677, A549 and H1975, while no obvious alteration was found in colon cancer cell lines.

In this review, we analysed studies reporting the process of histone modification, the enzymes associated and affected genes concerning human malignancies and histone enzyme inhibitor drugs used in cancer treatment. Variable degrees of expression of HDACs (histone deacetylases) and HATs (histone acetyltransferases) are found in many human malignant tissues and the histones acetylation seems to influence different processes including the progression of cell cycle, the dynamics of chromosomes, DNA recombination, DNA repair and apoptosis. Thus, the control of aberrant activity and/or expression of these proteins have been favorable in treatment of diseases as cancer. HDACi have shown efficacy in clinical trials in solid and hematological malignancies. Therefore, the development and use of HDACs inhibitors are increasing, leading to continue studying these enzyme expressions and behavior, aiming to determine tumors that will respond better to this type of treatment.",

The relationship between rs401681 variants and telomere length was analyzed in 134 non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). The rs401681 polymorphism had the following genotype frequencies: C/C in 52.2% of the samples, C/T in 30.6%, and T/T in 17.2%.

     "abstract": "Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis after spinal cord injury (SCI) contribute to glial scar formation that impedes axonal regeneration. The mechanisms underlying reactive astrocyte and microglia proliferation upon injury remain partially understood. Protein phosphatase 1, catalytic subunit, gamma isozyme (PPP1CC) participates in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. However, the expression and functions of PPP1CC following SCI are still unknown. In this study, an acute spinal cord contusion injury model in adult rats was established to investigate the potential role of PPP1CC during the pathological process of SCI. The palpable expression increase of PPP1CC after SCI was found by western blot and immunohistochemistry staining. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that PPP1CC expression mainly increased in astrocytes and microglia, as well as PPP1CC and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) co-localized in astrocytes and microglia. Furthermore, PCNA expression also elevated after SCI in a similar manner as PPP1CC. In vitro, PPP1CC and PCNA expression in primary rat spinal cord astrocytes and microglia changed in a similar concentration- and time-dependent manner according to LPS treatment. In addition, PPP1CC knockdown in astrocytes and microglia resulted in the decrease of PCNA expression and the number of Brdu positive cells after LPS stimulation, showing that PPP1CC promoted astrocyte and microglia proliferation after inflammation. In a word, PPP1CC might be associated with astrocyte and microglia proliferation after SCI, implying that PPP1CC is a potential molecular target for the therapy of SCI.",

Overexpression of P4HA1 is associated with decreased survival for patients with breast and prostate cancer. However, the prognostic significance of P4HA1 for glioma patients remains undefined.The expression of P4HA1 in 290 gliomas (WHO grade II\u2013IV) and 10 normal brain tissues was examined with TMA-based immunohistochemistry assay. The correlation between P4HA1 expression and clinicopathological parameters as well as the prognosis of glioma patients was investigated.Cytoplasmic expression of P4HA1 is high in 37.93% of all glioma cases, with 44.98% in high-grade gliomas and 19.75% in low-grade gliomas respectively. Increased P4HA1 level was correlated with advanced histological grade (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and old age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Upregulation of P4HA1, as well as histological grade, was an independent risk factor for unfavorable prognosis. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that high P4HA1 expression was significantly associated with poor prognosis for high-grade gliomas (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) but not for low-grade gliomas.P4HA1 was upregulated in gliomas. High expression of P4HA1 was correlated with the malignancy of gliomas and could serve as a prognostic indicator for patients with high-grade gliomas.",

Our research aimed to investigate and assess fetal lung injury in a rat model of APIP and its possible mechanisms. The APIP model was induced by sodium taurocholate in Sprague-Dawley rats during the third trimester. Sham-operated (SO) rats in late gestation were used as controls, and dynamic observation and detection in the SO and acute pancreatitis (AP) groups were performed at 3 time-points. Histological changes in the fetal lungs, as well as the maternal pancreas and placenta were assessed. The levels of serum amylase, lipase, TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were detected in maternal rats, and the expression of surfactant proteins A, B, C and D as well as their mRNA were determined. In this study, fetal lung injury as well as maternal pancreas and placenta injuries occurred in a time-dependent manner. The levels of serum amylase, lipase and TNF-\u03b1 were markedly increased in maternal rats, and the levels of surfactant proteins A, B, C and D in fetal lungs were significantly decreased in the fetal lungs of the AP group. Ultrastructure injuries and the dysregulated synthesis and secretion of pulmonary surfactant proteins were observed in the AP group.Our research suggests that fetal lung injury is involved in the rat model of APIP and that the dysregulated synthesis and secretion of pulmonary surfactant proteins play a critical role in fetal lung injury during APIP.",

The 3 patients were all men, ranging from 51 to 74 years in age, and they all presented with systemic lymphadenopathy with anemia, hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein, and polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Lymph node biopsy specimens of the 3 cases showed histological features of plasma cell-type CD, including atrophic germinal centers and interfollicular plasmacytosis, with no light chain restriction. However, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated an abnormal B-cell population with CD5 expression, and further analysis using cyclin D1 immunostaining highlighted a neoplastic component that was restricted to the mantle zone. These neoplastic cells were immunohistochemically positive for CD20, CD5, and SOX11, and negative for CD3, CD10, and HHV8. The Ki67 index was low. All patients were finally diagnosed with MCL. This rare type of MCL can be misdiagnosed clinically and histologically as CD.

In contrast to weak or no staining of KIFC1 in non-neoplastic mucosa, ESCC tissue showed stronger, more extensive KIFC1 staining. In total, 95 (72%) of 132 ESCC cases were positive for KIFC1. Immunostaining of ALDH1 was also performed, and KIFC1-positive ESCC cases were significantly frequently found in ALDH1-positive ESCC cases compared with ALDH1-negative ESCC cases. Spheroid colony formation is an effective method to characterize CSCs, thus we analyzed sphere number and size at 15\u00a0days in ESCC cells downregulated for KIFC1 by siRNA transfection.

Recent studies have unraveled STAT6 as a useful diagnostic immunohistochemical (IHC) marker for a SFT and NAB2-STAT6 as its specific gene fusion transcript.Thirty-three SFTs were tested for STAT6 immunostaining by polymer detection technique. STAT6 immunoexpression was further graded, based on intensity (mild, moderate and strong) and percentage of immunopositive tumor cells, ranging from 1 to 25%(1+); 26\u201350%(2+); 51\u201375%(3+) and in more than 75%(4+) tumor nuclei.These cases along with 17 other tumors were tested for 8 variants of NAB2-STAT6, using qualitative endpoint reverse-transcriptase (RT)-PCR technique. RNA extraction was performed using Recover All Total nucleic acid extraction kit. The selected cases were screened for all the 8 fusion variants, using 8 primer pairs for NAB2 and STAT6 genes.Thirty-three SFTs occurred in 18 men and 15 women (M: F\u00a0=\u00a01.2:1), with age varying from 13 to 74 years(average\u00a0=\u00a049.6); across various body sites. Immunohistochemically, most SFTs (30/33) (90.9%) displayed moderate to strong immunostaining for STAT6, including 3+ and 4+ immunostaining patterns in 27/33 (81.8%) tumors. By RT-PCR, 30/33(90.9%) cases of SFT were positive for NAB2-STAT6 fusions, including NAB2ex4/STAT6ex2 (7cases), NAB2ex7/STAT6ex2 (7cases), NAB2ex6/STAT6ex3 (6cases), NAB2ex6/SAT6ex16 (4cases), NAB2ex3/STAT6ex19 (4cases), NAB2ex6/STAT6ex17 (single case), NAB2ex4/STAT6ex4 (single case) and NAB2ex6/STAT6ex18 (none). NAB2-STAT6 fusions were not observed in 9 cases of synovial sarcoma, 4 of Ewing sarcoma, 2 of MPNST and 2 cases of dedifferentiated liposarcomas (100% specificity). On comparing with clinical outcomes, more cases (7/11)(63.6%) of classic SFT were associated with favorable outcomes, while more cases(5/8)(62%) of atypical and malignant SFTs were associated with aggressive outcomes.This study reinforces high sensitivity and specificity of NAB2-STAT6 fusion and its correlation with strong and diffuse IHC expression of STAT6 in a SFT, irrespective of its occurrence in various body sites and its histopathologic types. NAB2ex4-STAT6ex2 and NAB2ex7-STAT6ex2 fusions were relatively more frequently observed in our patients.

To date only 14 cases have been described. It is characterized by a distinct set of features including a nested epithelioid morphology, melanin pigmentation, labeling for markers of melanocytic differentiation, lack of labeling for markers of renal tubular differentiation, predominance in a younger age population and association with aggressive clinical behavior. There are noted similarities between that entity and TFE3 associated PEComas. There are no cases reported of equivalent melanotic TFEB translocation renal cancer.

The first is a melanotic TFE3 translocation renal cancer with an indolent clinical course, occurring in a patient more than 3-decades older than the usual average age in which such tumors have been described. The other case is, to our knowledge, the first reported melanotic TFEB translocation cancer of the kidney. Both cases exhibit the same H&E morphology as previously reported in melanotic translocation renal cancers and label accordingly with HMB45 and Melan-A. While the TFE3 melanotic tumor lacked any evidence of renal tubular differentiation, the TFEB melanotic cancer exhibited some staining for renal tubular markers.

     "abstract": "In diabetic patients, subcutaneous insulin injection may cause several types of injection site-related lesions, such as lipoatrophy, insulin-induced cutaneous lipohypertrophy (IICL), allergic reaction, and iatrogenic localized insulin-derived amyloidosis (LIDA). Among these complications, both IICL and LIDA present as tumor-like and slow growing lesions; and they may be confused with one another. The clinical implication and management of IICL and LIDA are different. LIDA causes poor blood glycemic controls due to inadequate absorption of the insulin. Thus, accurate diagnosis of the lesion is critical in diabetic patients.LIDA is an extremely rare complication and often overlooked, it is managed by a surgical intervention. Whereas, IICL is a common side effect and can be managed by a non-surgical approach. Furthermore, in long-standing diabetics, patients may develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, proteinuria, peripheral, and autonomic neuropathy; these symptoms can be mistaken for a systemic amyloidosis. It is also necessary to distinguish LIDA from the systemic amyloidosis, which requires a more aggressive systemic therapy. LIDA should also be distinguished from primary cutaneous amyloidosis, with high risk of progression to a systemic amyloidosis. In this effort we reviewed 25 published manuscripts, including case reports and case series studies. We also summarized the literature and discussed differential diagnosis, including the approach to diagnose LIDA.The identification of amyloid material and immunoreactivity with anti-insulin antibodies are key diagnostic features of LIDA. Although several clinical and animal studies were made in recent years, the lesion is still under-diagnosed and underreported. The clinical suspicion and knowledge of the lesion play a crucial role for the accurate diagnosis of LIDA. Surgical excision of the lesion can dramatically decrease insulin requirement and improve glycemic control.",

In this study, we investigated apoptosis induced by EGCG and the underlying molecular mechanisms in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of EGCG on esophageal cancer cell (Eca109 and Ec9706) were detected by MTT. Using flow cytometry, we determined the cellular apoptosis, bcl-2, bax and caspase-3 protein expression in Eca109 and Ec9706 cells following treatment with EGCG for 24\u00a0h. After treatment of Eca109/ABCG2 (an esophageal cancer multidrug resistance cell line) cells with adriamycin (ADM) combined with EGCG for 24\u00a0h, the cellular apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential, ADM concentration in cells and ABCG2 protein expression were detected by flow cytometry. EGCG inhibited the growth of Eca109 and Ec9706 cells in a dose- and time- dependent manner. EGCG induced apoptosis, decreased the bcl-2 protein expression and increased the expression of bax and caspase-3 protein. The rate of apoptosis and ADM concentration in the Eca109/ABCG2 cells following treatment with ADM and EGCG were higher than that with ADM treatment alone, although the mitochondrial membrane potential was significantly lower (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). EGCG reduced the ABCG2 expression of Eca109/ABCG2 cells. Our data indicated that EGCG inhibited cell growth and induced esophageal cancer cell apoptosis. It reduced the bcl-2 protein expression and increased the bax and caspase-3 protein expression. EGCG reversed multi-drug resistance by reducing ABCG2 expression and increasing the anticancer drug concentration in cancer cells.",

However, the angiogenesis roles of AEG-1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain to be further elucidated. In the present study, the expression level of AEG-1 mRNA in seven human lung cell lines and 89 paired tissue samples (tumor tissues (TTs) and pair-matched normal adjacent tissues (PMNATs)) from NSCLC patients was detected by real-time PCR. Staining of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and intratumoral microvessel density (iMVD, labeled by CD105) were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, cell migration and invasion were evaluated by wound healing assay and transwell assays. AEG-1 mRNA level was significantly higher in human lung cancer cells and TTs than that in human normal bronchial epithelial cell line 16HBE and PMNATs, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Higher AEG-1 mRNA level in patients with NSCLC was correlated with clinical stages (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028), differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.042), and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004).

However, 95D cell line transfected with AEG-1 siRNA oligos (siAEG-1) exhibited no significant decrease of cell invasion or migration capacities when compared with the control cells (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).These results suggested that AEG-1 may play important roles at the transcription level in malignant transformation and tumor angiogenesis in NSCLC, and anti-AEG-1 mRNA expression may be a novel potential strategy for anti-angiogenic therapy of NSCLC.",

     "abstract": "Breast carcinomas (BC) belong to a heterogeneous group of malignant diseases. Correct categorization of BC based on molecular biomarkers has a very important role in deciding the proper course of therapy for each patient. It has been already shown that the decrease of TIMP metalloproteinase inhibitor 3 (TIMP-3) together with overexpression of microRNA-21 (miR-21) might be involved in the process of BC invasion. This is the first study that examined relationship among miR-21, TIMP-3 mRNA and TIPM-3 protein levels in BC groups formed according to invasiveness.In this study, we used 46 breast cancer samples. Estrogen and progesterone receptor (ER, PR) protein levels were evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) method. TIMP-3 mRNA expression was examined by two-step real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Western blot analysis was performed for 16 samples.Statistically significant differences in TIMP-3 expression levels between invasive groups were discovered in ER positive (ER+) (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015), Her-2 negative (p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) subgroups, and patients without lymph-node metastasis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039).

TIMP-3 protein levels negatively correlated with miR-21 levels in pure invasive BCs.These data suggest that signaling pathways involved in formation and progression of BCs in groups formed according to invasiveness might be different. Our findings propose that TIMP-3 mRNA expression levels could be significant prognostic parameter, but within specific BC subtypes.",

     "abstract": "Colorectal cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in the world. Tripartite motif containing 24 (TRIM24) is a member of the TRIM protein family and a coregulator for multiple nuclear receptors. Altered expression of TRIM24 has been shown in a spectrum of human cancers. However, the clinical role of TRIM24 in colorectal cancer remains unknown. Here, gene expression data in colorectal cancer and normal tissues were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Western blotting analysis was conducted to compare TRIM24 expression between colorectal cancer and non-cancerous tissues. Immunohistochemistry staining were performed to assess TRIM24 expression in colorectal cancer tissues, and statistical analyses were employed to evaluate the associations of TRIM24 expression with clinicopathologic features and overall survival. TRIM24 mRNA and protein levels were higher in colorectal cancer tissues than that in the normal controls. TRIM24 protein expression was positively correlated with tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0269), clinical stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0061), vital status (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0110) and serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0176). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that patients with higher TRIM24 expression had shorter survival time than those with lower TRIM24 expression. Multivariate analyses revealed TRIM24 expression was an independent prognostic factor (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In conclusion, our study suggests that TRIM24 may play a role in colorectal carcinogens and serve as a potential prognostic marker of human colorectal cancer.",

Stable OV-90 cells expressing p38\u03b1 and ATF2 inhibitor were established using shRNA lentivirus. Cell proliferation, invasion, and migration were analyzed in vitro. Tumor growth and chemosensitivity were investigated in xenograft tumor models. The percentage of positive p38\u03b1 and ATF2 expression was significantly higher in ovarian serous adenocarcinomas than that in normal fallopian tubes.

Some tumor characteristics including histologic type, invasion depth, ulceration, size, and lymphovascular invasion have been used to determine the endoscopic resectability of early gastric cancer; however, a more detailed analysis between clinicopathologic factors and lymph node metastasis is needed.We analyzed the correlation between the clinicopathological findings and LNM with 310 cases of early gastric cancer by dividing invasion depths in detail.LNM occurred in 3.2% and 16.2% of the T1a and T1b tumors, respectively. LNM was associated with invasion depth (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and lymphatic (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and perineural (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013) invasion. Among them, lymphatic invasion was the most powerful factor associated with LNM and significantly constant in T1a and T1b. The rate of LNM increased gradually as the tumor invaded deeper, and invasion of the muscularis mucosae layer was associated with an increased mixed adenocarcinoma incidence, suggesting that histologic diversity was associated with tumor invasiveness.We demonstrated that lymphatic invasion was the most important and powerful parameter for LNM in early gastric cancers. In addition, tumor invasiveness into the muscularis mucosae was accompanied by tumor histologic diversity.",

In this study, we assessed the expression and release of IGFBP-1 from gastric cancer cells with H. pylori 26695 infection and the biological functions of IGFBP-1 in gastric cancer cells. The results showed that the expression and release of IGFBP-1 were increased in gastric cancer cells (MGC-803, BGC-823, SGC-7901) infected with H. pylori 26695. In addition, the upregulation of IGFBP-1 was dose-dependent in BGC-823 cells infected with H. pylori 26695 but not time-dependent. The upregulation of IGFBP-1 got to peak at 12\u00a0h after H. pylori 26695 infection and then decreased over time. Subsequently, we measured its functions by silencing and overexpressing IGFBP1 which suggested that overexpression of IGFBP-1 could inhibit the migration of BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells. However, knocking down the IGFBP-1 could increase the migration of BGC-823 and SGC-7901 cells. Functional findings illustrated that IGFBP-1 was implicated in H. pylori 26695-induced MMP-9 expression in BGC-823 cells. In addition, overexpressing IGFBP1 reduce the promoting effect of MMP-9 on the BGC-823 cells migration. In summary, we demonstrated that IGFBP-1 suppress the migration of BGC-823 cells and play a protective role in the process of H. pylori-induced gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive neoplasm of pediatric and adolescent patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can be used to support the morphologic diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) in a convincing clinical/radiological context. Although neither NKX2.2 nor CD99 alone are entirely specific, when combined, the diagnostic specificity is high. The aim of the present study was to investigate the IHC expression of NKX2.2, ETV4 and BCOR in a large series of genetically confirmed ESFT. The results for CD99 and CAV-1 immunoreactivity, and the histological and fusion gene subtypes were retrieved from our previous study. NKX2.2 demonstrated moderate or strong nuclear positivity in 91.2% of the tumors. The staining intensity was heterogeneous. Many of the ESFT with negative NKX2.2 immunoreactivity were in bone. Strong/moderate ETV4 nuclear expression was detected in two small round cell tumors, both were negative for NKX2.2. No relationships could be found between expression of NKX2.2 and the histological subgroups or ESFT gene fusion subtypes. BCOR was negative in all ESFT. In conclusion, NKX2.2, ETV4 and BCOR IHC may be helpful in daily practice for distinguishing ESFT from CIC or BCOR-associated sarcomas, especially in hospitals without access to molecular assays. In addition, the combination of strong CD99 membranous positivity and nuclear NKX2.2 positivity seems to be very reliable for ESFT diagnosis in an appropriate clinicoradiological setting. So far no antibody is entirely specific for ESFT diagnosis, and the IHC or molecular results in round cell tumors of bone may be strongly influenced by decalcification processes.",

This study aimed to define the TTF-1 expression and lymph vessel density (LVD) in ovarian carcinomas and look for their correlations with clinicopathological features.We examined the incidence of thyroid transcription factor 1 expression (clone SPT24) and lymph vessel density (LVD) quantified through D2-40 by immunohistochemistry from 110 primary ovarian carcinomas and 40 benign ovarian tumor as controls in Chinese patients.Thyroid transcription factor 1 was detected in 28 primary ovarian carcinomas (25.5%), which was significantly higher than its expression in benign ovarian tumor. TTF-1 expression was correlated with tumor FIGO stage,T stage and lymphatic metastasis. Moreover, LVD was associated with tumor FIGO stage, TNM stage. Furthermore, the LVD counts in group of TTF-1 positive expression were higher than in group of TTF-1 negative expression.These findings indicated the occasional expression of TTF-1 immunoreactivity of ovarian carcinomas should be considered in the evaluation of neoplasms of unknown primary origin and TTF-1 might be involved in lymph node metastasis of ovarian carcinomas in the presence of lymphangiogenesis.",

Bioinformatics analyses were performed including differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs) identification, protein-protein interaction network construction, biological functions of prediction and ingenuity pathways analysis (IPA). Western Blotting (WB) was subjected to validate the protein expression levels of candidate DEGs in shOIP5 BC cell line.Respective 255 up- and 184 down-regulated DEGs were identified in shOIP5 group compared with shCtrl group. In the PPI network, CAND1 and MYC had the highest connectivity with DEGs. 439 DEGs were significantly enriched in inflammatory response, regulation of cell proliferation, Toll-like receptor signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction and bladder cancer. In the disease and function enrichment, DEGs were obviously involved in cellular movement, cellular growth and proliferation, cancer, inflammatory response, cell death and survival. In the OIP5 regulatory network, CDH2, IRS1, IRAK3, ID1, TNF, IL6, ITGA6, MYC and SOD2 interacted with OIP5. The WB validation results were compatible with our bioinformatics analyses.OIP5 interaction network might function as an oncogene in BC progression based on aberrant inflammatory responses.

The objective of this study was to investigate wether the evaluation of the immunohistochemical expression of genes CADM1, TWIST1 and CDH1 (E-cadherin), that take part in mechanisms of cell adhesion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, contributes to the differential diagnosis of melanocytic lesions difficult to diagnose.Retrospective cross-sectional study based on immunohistochemistry analysis of samples of 30 dysplastic compound melanocytic nevi, 30 melanomas less than 1.0\u00a0mm thick and 30 melanomas more than 1.0\u00a0mm thick, diagnosed between 2013 and 2016. A score was used to evaluate color intensity and percentage of cells stained.There were significant reductions in the expression of the genes CADM1 and CDH1 in melanomas (below and above 1.00\u00a0mm of thickness) and in melanomas more than 1.0\u00a0mm thick, respectively, compared to dysplastic compund melanocytic nevi. There was also lower expression of the genes CADM1 and CDH1 in melanomas greater than 1.0\u00a0mm thick compared to melanomas less than 1.0\u00a0mm. The gene TWIST1 showed no significant difference in expression between groups.These findings allow us to conclude that the immunohistochemical expression of CADM1 has the potential to contribute as an auxiliary tool to the differential diagnosis between nevi and melanomas.",

FoxA2 expression was investigated in five cases of AFP-producing gastric adenocarcinomas by immunohistochemistry, and all cases showed FoxA2 expression. Chromatin immunoprecipitation revealed the DNA binding of FoxA2 on the regulatory element of AFP gene in AFP-producing adenocarcinoma cells. The inhibition of FoxA2 expression with siRNA reduced the mRNA expression of liver-specific proteins, including AFP, albumin, and transferrin. The inhibition of FoxA2 also reduced the expressions of liver-enriched nuclear factors, i.e., hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF) 4\u03b1 and HNF6, although the expressions of HNF1\u03b1 and HNF1\u03b2 were not affected.

Five cysts had pure mesothelial lining, which was flattened to cuboidal, and demonstrated a positive reaction for mesothelial markers (eg. calretinin, WT1), and a negative reaction for EpCAM, EMA, PAX8 and ER. Two cysts had cuboidal to flattened lining, the cells of which were diffusely or focally positive for mesothelial markers, for some epithelial markers (eg. EpCAM and EMA) and despite a lack of m\u00fcllerian-type epithelium demonstrated a positive reaction for PAX8 and focally for ER.

     "abstract": "Psoriasis is a common autoimmune disease of unknown etiology. Recently, much attention has been paid to evidence that a local hypercoagulable state is an important contributing factor to the development of inflammatory skin diseases. Thus, the aim of this study was to characterize the local hemostasis in the affected skin of patients with psoriasis.Skin biopsies of psoriatic plaques were obtained from 73 consecutive patients (48\u00a0M, 25\u00a0F, average age 45 years) with at least a one year history of the disease. The studied patients had not received any specific systemic treatment for at least 4 weeks before the biopsy was done. As a control, normal skin biopsies were obtained from 16 healthy subjects. For immunohistological study, the En-Vision method (DAKO EnVision Kit \u00ae/Alkaline Phosphatase detection system), and monoclonal antibodies anti-tissue factor (TF), anti-thrombomodulin (TM) and anti-von Willebrand Factor (vWF) were used. All these molecules were assessed semi-quantitatively in the frozen sections.Clinically, the Body Surface Area index ranged between 1\u201390% and the Psoriasis Area Severity Index score ranged from 1.6 to 47. Immunohistochemistry revealed redistribution of TF antigens from the upper to lower layers of the epidermis as compared to the control. It was collaborated with the number of TF-positive cells in the psoriatic skin sections (78.3%) as compared with the healthy subjects (34.4%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In addition, TF was uniformly and moderately expressed on capillary endothelial cells of the plaque sections in 43 out of 73 patients (58.9%). As far as the thrombomodulin is concerned, TM was clearly down-regulated and localized mainly in the upper layers of the psoriatic epidermis. It was collaborated with the number of TM positive cells in the psoriatic skin sections (38.9%) as compared with the healthy subjects (66.7%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). All capillary vessels found in the biopsy sections were positive for TM and vWF staining, with similar expression (\u22652+) in both groups. In the current study, no relationship was found between the TF, TM and vWF expression and the PASI and BAS (NS).A local procoagulable state found in psoriatic plaques suggests a significant role of local tissue hemostasis in pathogenesis of the disease. These findings indicate another potential target for a therapeutic approach in patients with psoriasis, although further research would help elucidate the exact mechanisms.",

     "abstract": "Pituitary adenomas may be classified as either functioning or non-functioning, depending on whether excess hormone secretion can be clinically identified. Of the six hormones produced in the anterior pituitary, TSH, FSH and LH are known as glycoproteins and contain two subunits (\u03b1 and \u03b2). While \u03b1-subunit is identical within all of them, each \u03b2-subunit is unique and biologically specific. Independently, the \u03b1- and \u03b2-subunits are inactive and only induce a hormonal response when they are non-covalently associated. Studies have shown that in certain cases, pituitary adenomas may abnormally secrete only \u03b1-subunit, detectable in the serum or through immunohistochemical analysis. In the present study, we examined \u03b1-subunit immunoexpression in surgically removed non-functioning pituitary adenomas and analyzed its prognostic value. Results showed that expression of \u03b1-subunit in clinically non-functioning pituitary adenomas is not a rare occurrence. While there were no age/gender differences between tumors that expressed \u03b1-subunit and those that did not, \u03b1-subunit immunonegative adenomas presented with suprasellar extension more frequently and had an Ki67 proliferation greater than 3%. The use of immunohistochemical techniques to determine the presence of \u03b1-subunit may provide information on tumor cell proliferation and biologic behavior. To fully understand the role of \u03b1-subunit in pituitary adenomas more work is needed.",

     "abstract": "Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has an aggressive phenotype and poor prognosis. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is often used to treat TNBC, but some patients are resistant to NAC. We postulated that a subpopulation of TNBC cells expressing IMP3, an oncofetal protein, could be resistant to NAC, contributing to the poor prognosis. We investigated immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 in 42 TNBC patients who underwent NAC in association with clinical outcomes. The patients were divided into IMP3 positive (+) (n\u00a0=\u00a019) and negative (\u2212) (n\u00a0=\u00a023) groups. High Ki67 positivity was detected in 13 patients of the IMP3\u00a0+\u00a0group and 8 cases in the IMP3 \u2013 group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). While 9 patients in the IMP3 \u2013 group (39%) were responders, the majority of the IMP3\u00a0+\u00a0patients (84.2%) were non-responders (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). In a Cox proportional hazard model, IMP3 expression was independently associated with poor NAC response and clinical outcomes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 and 0.046, respectively). The IMP3\u00a0+\u00a0group showed a tendency toward shorter overall survival compared to the IMP3 \u2013 group with marginal significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). These findings suggest that IMP3\u00a0+\u00a0tumor cells contributed to the poor clinical outcomes by exerting a chemoresistance to NAC, and that IMP3 expression has prognostic value as a biomarker for chemosensitivity and overall survival in TNBC.",

Statistically, AML children with low miR-122 expression more frequently had large white blood cell count (P\u00a0=\u00a00.022), French-American-British classification subtype M7 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), unfavorable cytogenetics (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and day 7 response to the treatment (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036), short relapse-free (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and overall (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) survivals than those with high expression.

Functionally, the enforced expression of miR-122 in AML cell lines efficiently suppressed cell proliferation and reduced the ratio of S-phase cells in vitro (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, the abnormal expression of miR-122 may be a marker of the aggressive progression in childhood AML. Importantly, its downregulation may serve as a prognostic factor to predict poor outcome. Our study also reveal that miR-122 may function as a tumor suppressor in childhood AML, highlighting a new therapeutic strategy for this malignancy.",

The positive rate of Grb7 protein expression was 34.2%, which was significantly higher than that in adjacent non-cancerous cervical tissue (0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The expression of Grb7 was found to be correlated with age, tumor size, serosal invasion, differentiated degree, tumor stage, early or advanced stage and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with positive Grb7 protein expression had a lower overall survival rate than patients without Grb7 expression. In addition, Grb7 plays an important role in promoting tumor progression, including invasion and anti-apoptosis, in cervical cancer cell line. Down-regulation of Grb7 repressed the expression of MMP-9 and Bcl-2, and increased the expression of Bax in Grb7 knockdown Hela cells.

In this study, we established the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 30\u00a0min in the rats with diabetic hyperglycemia. The neurological deficit score, 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining and pathohistology are applied to detect the extent of the damage. The expression of Fis1, Mfn2 and Lc3 in the brain is investigated by immunohistochemical and Western blotting techniques. The results showed that the streptozotocin-induced diabetic hyperglycemia and MCAO-induced focal cerebral ischemia were successfully prepared in rats.

Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting showed that pretreatment with CoQ10 or insulin could significantly reduce the expression of Fis1 protein in the brain at 24\u00a0h and 72\u00a0h reperfusion. Inversely, a significantly increased expression of Mfn2 was observed in the rats CoQ10 or insulin pretreated at 24\u00a0h and/or 72\u00a0h reperfusion when compared with matched hyperglycemic rats.

This study aims to investigate the clinicopathologic significance of M2 macrophages in patients of glomerulonephritis with crescents.Renal tissue samples from patients of glomerulonephritis with more than 30% cell or cell-fibrous crescents, including lupus nephritis (LN, n\u00a0=\u00a014), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV, n\u00a0=\u00a014), IgA nephropathy(IgAN) (n\u00a0=\u00a011), Henoch Schonlein purpura glomerulonephritis(HSPGN)(n\u00a0=\u00a08)were included in this study. The expression of CD163, CD206 and CD68 in renal tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry or immunofluorescence.(1) CD163 was mainly expressed in cell or cell-fibrous crescents, proliferative glomerular lesions and acute tubulointerstitial injury. There were numerous CD163-positive cells in LN and AAV in comparison with IgAN and HSPGN.

     "abstract": "Minimally invasive therapies, including endoscopic mucosal resection or sentinel node navigation surgery, have been widely applied in early gastric cancer because of their benefits in promoting patient quality of life. However, lymph node dissection is beyond the capability of endoscopic therapy, and in sentinel node navigation surgery, the potential for skip metastasis is not negligible. Therefore, the possibility of lymph node metastasis is the most important factor to consider when deciding whether to apply the minimally invasive therapies. In the present study, the significance of epithelial mesenchymal transition and stem cell marker expression in lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer was investigated.We evaluated the significance of the expression of 5 epithelial mesenchymal transition-related markers (E-cadherin, MMP7, S100A, Snail-1, and HGF) and 6 stem cell markers (ALDH1, SOX2, CD24, CD44, CD54, and CD133) in 119 early gastric cancer specimens using immunohistochemistry. Because protein expression is heterogeneous in gastric cancer, we analyzed the expression of these markers in two selected regions (one each at the superficial zone and the deep invasive front).Expression of E-cadherin, MMP7, HGF, and CD133 at the deep invasive front was associated with the absence of lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.013, 0.018,\u2009<0.001, and 0.026, respectively). Presence of diffuse-type component, lymphatic invasion, and lack of expression of HGF and CD133 at the deep invasive front were independent predictive markers of lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019, <0.001, 0.015, and 0.047, respectively).Lymph node metastasis is strongly associated with expression status of HGF and CD133 at the deep invasive front, suggesting the usefulness of these proteins as independent predictive markers of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer.",

     "abstract": "To evaluate the maspin expression in colorectal carcinomas (CRC) and its possible role in quantification of the tumor budding.The tumor budding was prospectively quantified in 49 consecutive cases of patients that underwent surgical resection for CRC. The cases were divided in two groups: group A (n\u00a0=\u00a023) \u2212 low budding (<\u00a05 tumor buds per high microscopic field) and group B (n\u00a0=\u00a026) \u2212 high budding CRCs (\u2265\u00a05 buds). Maspin expression was evaluated in the tumor core and the buds from the hot spot area in 44 of the microsatellite stable adenocarcinomas. Its expression was quantified as negative, cytoplasmic only, nuclear only or mixed expression (cytoplasm and nucleus).Compared with group A, a higher pT (p <\u00a00.0001) and pN stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0001) and infiltrating aspect at macroscopic evaluation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0081) was identified in group B. No correlation between the maspin expression in the tumore core and the budding grade was noted (p\u00a0=\u00a00.14). Compared with the tumor core, the cytoplasm to nuclear translocation of maspin was more frequently observed in cases from group B than A (n\u00a0=\u00a00.0063).For the colorectal carcinomas, the infiltrative aspect at macroscopic evaluation and nuclear maspin in the buds might be used as indicators of risk for lymph node metastases. Maspin nuclear expression in the buds may be helpful for a proper budding assessment and may serve as a negative prognostic factor.",

The cell viability was assessed by MTT assay and percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by flow cytometry.The MN and NB were most frequently seen indicators and main determinants of morphological CIN. However, the morphological CIN score did not show any correlation with cell viability and apoptosis. Aneuploidy however was found to correlate positively with cell viability and NB score in our study (P-value <0.05).The study for the 1st time attempted to develop a scoring system for CIN based on morphological parameters. However, a no correlation was observed between the later and cell viability or apoptosis. More robust techniques to quantify CIN may perhaps be more helpful in exploring the true link between CIN and cell viability in future.",

     "abstract": "The histopathological synovitis score evaluates the immunological and inflammatory changes of synovitis in a graduated manner generally customary for diagnostic histopathological scores. The score results from semiquantitative evaluation of the width of the synovial surface cell layer, the cell density of the stroma and the density of the inflammatory infiltration into 4 semiquantitative levels (normal 0, mild 1, moderate 2, severe 3). The addition of these values results in a final score of 0\u20139 out of 9. On the basis of this summation the condition is divided into low-grade synovitis and high-grade synovitis: A synovitis score of 1 to\u00a0\u2264\u00a04 is called low-grade synovitis (arthrosis-associated/OA synovitis, posttraumatic synovitis, meniscopathy-associated synovitis and synovitis with haemochromatosis). A synovitis score of\u00a0\u2265\u00a05 to 9 is called high-grade synovitis (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, Lyme arthritis, postinfection/reactive arthritis and peripheral arthritis with Bechterew's disease). By means of the synovitis score it is therefore possible to distinguish between degenerative/posttraumatic diseases (low-grade synovitis) and inflammatory rheumatic diseases (high-grade synovitis) with a sensitivity of 61.7% and a specificity of 96.1%. The diagnostic accuracy according to ROC analysis (AUC: 0.8\u20130.9) is good. Since the first publication (2002) and an associated subsequent publication (2006), the synovitis score has nationally and internationally been accepted for histopathological assessment of the synovitis. In a PubMed data analysis (status: 14.02.2017), the following citation rates according to Cited by PubMed Central articles resulted for the two synovitis score publications: For DOI: 10.1078/0344-0338-5710261 there were 29 Cited by PubMed Central articles and for the second extended publication DOI:10.1111/j.1365-2559.2006.02508 there were 44 Cited by PubMed Central articles. Therefore a total of 73 PubMed citations are observed over a period of 15 years, which demonstrates an international acceptance of the score. This synovitis score provides for the first time a diagnostic, standardised and reproducible histopathological evaluation method enabling a contribution to the differential diagnosis of chronic inflammatory general joint diseases. This is particularly the case by incorporation into the joint pathology algorithm. To specify the synovitis score an immunohistochemical determination of various inflammation-relevant CD antigens is proposed to enable a risk stratification of high-grade synovitis (e.g.: progression risk and sensitivity for biologicals).",

     "abstract": "Brain metastases (BM) are common among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and have been associated with significant morbidity and limited survival. Early and sensitive detection of BM is essential for improving prognosis. Recently, microRNA-375(miR-375) which is specifically expressed in the brain has been found significantly dysregulated in many human cancers. However, there is still no data whether miR-375 is associated with higher risk of BM development in NSCLC. In this study, we detected the miR-375 expression using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and assessed its predictive and prognostic significance. Our result showed that miR-375 expression was significantly down-regulated in NSCLC patients with BM(BM+, N\u00a0=\u00a030) compared with NSCLC without BM(BM-, N\u00a0=\u00a030) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Statistical analysis indicated that low miR-375 expression was linked to advanced disease stage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and brain metastasis (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in NSCLC patient. Survival analysis suggested that low-expression group had significantly shorter overall survival than high-expression group in NSCLC patients with BM(log-rank test: P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) as well as the total cases(log-rank test: P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis indicated that low miR-375 expression was independently linked to poor survival of patients with NSCLC (HR\u00a0=\u00a05.48, 95% CI: 1.93\u201315.56, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In addition, we found that VEGF and MMP-9 were over-expressed in down-regulated miR-375 expression cases. Collectively, this study demonstrated that miR-375 may play an important role as a predictive biomarker in brain metastasis and an independent prognostic factor in NSCLC. Over-expression of VEGF and MMP-9 may be the reason for poor prognosis of NSCLC patients with low miR-375 expression.",

Luciferase reporter assay was used to confirm its effect on the regulation of the target gene Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene 1 (RB1).miR-215 was frequently up-regulated in GC tissues compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and GC cell lines. miR-215 expression level was correlated with the progression of tumor invasion and tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage. Over-expression miR-215 in GC cell lines promoted cell migration and invasion. Besides, miR-215 could down-regulate the expression of RB1 in vitro via directly binding to its 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR), while the expression of RB1 would suppress the miR-215-indueced GC cell migration and invasion.miR-215 promoted cell migration and invasion of gastric cancer by directly targeting RB1.",

Cyr61 and VEGF expressions moderately correlated with each other in osteosarcoma, and exhibited significant association with Enneking stage and distant metastasis. In addition, the high expression of both proteins significantly correlated with short overall survival time in these patients. The key finding in this study was that both Cyr61 and VEGF expressions were independent prognostic indicators of overall survival.

Channel activity promoted BCa invasion of Matrigel\u00aein vitro and metastasis in vivo. Consequently, expression of nNav1.5 has been proposed as a functional biomarker of BCa cells with metastatic potential. Here, we have determined immunohistochemically both nNav1.5 and total VGSC (tVGSC) protein expression in a range of adult human tissues. Some VGSC protein was expressed in normal colon, small intestine, stomach, prostate, bladder and breast. As expected, high levels of VGSC protein were expressed in brain, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. On the other hand, nNav1.5 protein was not expressed in any of the normal tissues tested except breast where a low-level of protein was present. In comparison to normal breast, nNav1.5 protein expression in BCa was consistently widespread and occurred at a significantly higher level. We also questioned whether there was any relationship between the nNav1.5 protein expression and the estrogen receptor (ER\u03b1) status of BCa and obtained the following results. First, all cases lacking nNav1.5 were positive for ER\u03b1. Second, in all ER\u03b1-negative tissues, nNav1.5 protein was expressed in plasma membrane. Third, however, in ER\u03b1-positive cases, nNav1.5 protein expression was observed in both plasma membrane and cytoplasm. In conclusion, nNav1.5 protein has a restricted expression pattern among human tissues. High level expression occurs in BCa and associates with ER\u03b1 status. These results further support the proposition that nNav1.5 is a novel biomarker of metastatic BCa.",

Besides, LAMP1 expression levels were positively correlated with TNM stages (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The higher the TNM stages, the higher the LAMP1 expression levels. Similar results also appeared in degrees of tumor histological differentiation (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), but not in ages, genders, tumor size, T status, lymphatic metastasis and tumor locations (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05).LAMP1 is involved in the TNM stages and histological differentiation of the ESCC. Targeted therapy for LAMP1 may be a promising novel therapeutic strategy against poorly differentiated ESCC.",

We selected CD24, CD44, CD133, and dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), as they have been suggested to be candidate CSC markers. Expression of these markers was investigated by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining. IHC staining for CD24, CD44, CD133 and ALDH1 was evaluated according to staining intensity and proportion. The intensity and proportion scores were multiplied together for a total score, which was either 0\u20132 (negative) or 3\u20137 (positive).

Many studies have shown that MYBL2 is high expresssion in several human malignancies including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). However, its role in PDAC is still unclear. The present study is designed to investigate MYBL2 expression levels and prognostic significance in PDAC patients. We assessed MYBL2 expression level by immunohistochemistry in tumor tissues from 93 PDAC patients undergoing curative resection. The association of MYBL2 expression with clinicopathological parameters was evaluated by Pearson\u2019s chi-square (\u03c72) test, Fisher\u2019s exact test, and Spearman\u2019s rank. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effect of MYBL2 expression on survival. The expression of MYBL2 was significantly higher in PDAC cells compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the level of 5hmC in primary oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and determine its clinical significance as well as prognostic value in predicting patients\u2019 outcomes. The expression levels of 5hmC in 95 human OSCC samples and 24 normal oral mucosa were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, the associations between the expression status of 5hmC and several clinicopathological parameters as well as patients\u2019 survival were further statistically assessed. Our immunohistochemical results revealed that 5hmC was significantly downregulated in a significant fraction of OSCC as compared their normal counterparts. However, elevated 5hmC level was found to be significantly associated with pathological grade and cervical node metastasis with P-values of 0.0239 and 0.0041, respectively. Results from Kaplan-Meier cumulative survival analyses indicated that high expression of 5hmC in OSCC was significantly associated with decreased overall survival, disease-free and disease-specific survival as compared to those with low 5hmC (Log-rank, P\u00a0=\u00a00.0210, 0.0313, 0.0415, respectively). Furthermore, the univariate and multivariate survival analyses further identified the expression status of 5hmC as an independent prognostic factor affecting patients\u2019 survival. Taken together, our results reveal a significant decrease of 5hmC level in a large subset of OSCC. However, high level of 5hmC associates with tumor aggressive features and unfavorable prognosis in a fraction of OSCC patients.",

In this study, 16 MB specimens including 10 classical subtypes of MB and 6 desmoplastic subtypes of MB (DMB), along with 5 normal cerebellum samples, were obtained from clinics. With immunohistochemical staining, prominently expressed topoII\u03b2 was seen in normal cerebellar tissues, while there was no or less pronounced staining in classical MB cells. Interestingly, on comparing topoII\u03b2 expression in different regions of DMB samples, relatively high levels of topoII\u03b2 were revealed within nodules composed of differentiated neurocytic cells, which are known to predict a favorable clinical outcome for MB. We also examined the expression of two epigenetic factors, H3K27me3 and JMJD3 in the different tissues. Very high levels of H3K27me3 were found in all MB samples, except the intranodules of DMB, where JMJD3 expression was more prominent. Furthermore, a negative correlation between topoII\u03b2 and H3K27me3 in MB was revealed in this study. Thus, our data primarily indicate that topoII\u03b2 can be used to estimate neuronal differentiation in MB, and may serve as a target for improving the survival rates for this condition. We speculate that H3K27me3 repression of topoII\u03b2 at the transcriptional level may occur, although this needs to be verified using larger numbers of MB samples in future experiments.",

Furthermore, immune globulin deposition, vasculitis, and fibrinous exudate have not been observed in IPCC.

However, a definitive characterisation, detection in all joint localisations and a causal clarification of the pathogenesis are lacking. In this study a total of 175 SLIM (synovial-like interface membrane) cases with PE supramacroparticles of knee joint prostheses (n\u00a0=\u00a089), hip joint prostheses (n\u00a0=\u00a044), ankle joint prostheses (n\u00a0=\u00a036) and prostheses in three localisations of the upper extremities (n\u00a0=\u00a06) were systematically investigated. The arithmetic mean of the particle length varied greatly within the prosthesis types. This had a significant positive correlation with the prosthesis lifetime and negative correlation with the date of implantation. It can be concluded that both the lifetime and the time of implantation have an influence on the particle length. The prostheses with supramacroparticulate damage moreover showed a clearly reduced survival rate compared with other data published on the prosthesis lifetime. The material wear therefore could not be attributed solely to the usual fatigue factors. Since loosening of the prostheses, decentring of the PE components or damage to the PE inlay existed in all cases, mechanical dysloading seems to be the most probable cause of PE supramacroparticle genesis. Due to the striking length and for demarcation from PE macroparticles, the term supramacroparticulate PE is proposed for a length of more than 100\u00a0\u03bcm. In the extended histopathological particle algorithm supramacroparticulate PE has been included in the macroparticles category and should be taken into account and interpreted causally in histopathological diagnostics of joint prosthesis failure.",

To investigate that acinar cell differentiation is a non-specific metaplastic phenomenon that can occur in pancreatic ductal system, especially when chronically inflamed and dilated, and doesn\u2019t necessarily imply an acinar cell neoplasm, we retrospectively analyzed cases diagnosed as PACA and cases with post-obstructive cystic dilatation of pancreatic ducts for acinar cell differentiation using immunohistochemistry for trypsin. The etiology of obstruction was microscopic periductal pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PanNET) and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). All cases of post-obstructive cystic dilatation showed multiple varying sized cysts distal to the obstruction with histologic findings virtually identical to PACAs. The cysts in both conditions were lined by a single layer of non-dysplastic flattened to columnar ductal-type epithelium with areas of acinar cell differentiation. Trypsin immunohistochemistry confirmed presence of acinar cell differentiation in all cases of post-obstructive cysts and PACAs. Our results suggest that acinar cell differentiation is common in post-obstructive cyst formation, and changes are identical to PACAs. These findings further support the notion that PACA is a benign non-neoplastic cystic lesion with acinar cell differentiation. The findings also suggest that in cases with histology resembling \u201cPACA\u201d or showing diffuse ductal cystic dilation, careful gross examination should be carried out for a proximal obstructive lesion, which can be subtle and easily be missed on initial examination.",

After treatment of 5-FU, the intestinal mucous were damaged, although the number of msi-1 positive cells has a little decrease, there was no statistical difference among the mice at different time after injection (P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). However, the percentage of msi-1 positive cells increased significantly after injection (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and the percentage of msi-1 positive cells decreased gradually during the repaired procedure of the intestinal mucous. There was significant positive correction between the percentage of msi-1 positive cells and the percentage of Rho low staining cell fraction (r\u00a0=\u00a00.867, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) after 5-FU injection.The Rho low staining cell fraction from intestinal mucous contained rich intestinal epithelial stem cells, and the intestinal epithelial stem cell which expressed msi-1 played a key role in repairing the damage of intestinal mucous induced by 5-FU.",

However, certain types of rare EGFR mutations have be linked to cases with poor response to EGFR TKIs. Therefore, extensive molecular screening and pathological characterization are essential for accurate diagnosis and selection of effective treatment plans. Although a large body of studies have established the rate of EGFR mutations as a whole entity, the rates of each individual types of mutations, especially those rare ones, have not been precisely determined in large patient populations with uniform genetic background. To address this issue, we assembled a large cohort of 456 Chinese patients with lung cancers to determine the rate of both common and rare forms of EGFR mutations and associated clinicopathological features in this retrospective study. We have found single or double EGFR mutations in 200 (43.9%) patients, including exon 19 deletions (E19del) (20%), exon 21 L858R (17.1%) and L861Q (1.5%) point mutations, exon 20 T790M (1.3%) and other mutations (1,3%), exon 18 mutations (1.3%), and double mutations (1.3%). EGFR mutation as well as its subtypes E19del, L858R, or double mutations were associated with female patients or never-smokers. In contrast, rare mutations, especially EGFR TKI resistant exon 20 mutations, were not statistically associated with any clinicopathological features, implicating that tumorigenesis driven by different EGFR mutations were mechanistically different. In summary, we have determined occurring rate of EGFR subtype mutations and demonstrated that different mutations showed different clinicopathological manifestations in lung cancer.",

We found that PAM induced plasma cell differentiation and reduced tumorigenic population. PAM increased the expression level of PRDM1\u03b1, which is a transcription factor promoting plasma cell differentiation, suggesting that plasma cell differentiation of LPL might be mediated by PRDM1\u03b1.

Resection specimens of the primary tumor were reviewed to confirm the diagnoses and the stage of the disease. Data on age, gender, tumor characteristics (localization, size, macroscopic growth pattern, histologic type, grade, angiolymphatic invasion, TNM stage), applied treatments and clinical outcome (overall survival, local recurrence and distant metastasis) were obtained from the hospital records. Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue specimens was performed to determine HIF-1\u03b1, CA9 and CXCR4 expressions.Overall, 94.0% of cases showed HIF-1\u03b1 immunoreactivity, 89% showed CXCR4 immunoreactivity, and 15.6% showed CA9 immunoreactivity, while weak expression of immunohistochemical markers was noted in 51.1%, 93.0% and 50.5% of cases, respectively.HIF-1\u03b1 expression was higher among males than in females (median (min-max) final score of 6 (0\u20139) vs. 3 (0\u20139), p\u00a0=\u00a00.013).

However the current testing methods require complex infrastructures and the delay for diagnosis remains often rather long, especially for initiating an appropriate treatment in patients with advanced stage tumor and short life expectancy.We evaluated the Idylla\u2122 fully automated molecular diagnostic system in routine conditions in 79 lung adenocarcinomas and 14 other non-small cell lung carcinomas, mostly in advanced stages (III or IV: 85%). Tests were performed on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (n\u00a0=\u00a083) or fresh (n\u00a0=\u00a010) material, including cytological (n\u00a0=\u00a024) and small biopsy (n\u00a0=\u00a020) samples. In prospective cases (n\u00a0=\u00a082), the most likely mutated gene (EGFR in non or occasional smokers and KRAS in smokers) was tested first; the second gene being only tested in case of negativity.The system did not require complex training. Mutational status was obtained in few hours after making the histological diagnosis and on the day of the patient\u2019s sampling by analyzing fresh material. The sequential testing strategy avoided 15 EGFR and 15 KRAS tests that would have been negative. Compared with reference methods, global specificity and sensitivity were both 100% for EGFR mutations, and 89.1% and 91.7% for KRAS mutations, respectively.We demonstrated that such easy-to-use systems can permit pathologists to integrate a reliable EGFR/KRAS status in their initial pathologic report, and could be useful complementary tools to the current molecular diagnostic methods, with regard to prompt therapeutic management of lung cancer patients.",

     "abstract": "Studies on the pattern-based classification for invasive endocervical adenocarcinoma showed that tumors with nondestructive invasion (pattern-A) have a 0% rate of nodal metastases. Our understanding of pattern-A tumors and their distinction from in-situ adenocarcinoma requires further study. Thirteen sections diagnosed independently as pattern-A adenocarcinoma by three gynecologic pathologists, and 14 sections of benign endocervix were selected. Three additional pathologists (reviewers) evaluated a digital image from each section and classified it as pattern-A or benign based on architecture only. To blind the interpretation to cytologic features, nuclei and cytoplasm were obscured using morphometric software (Zen 2011, Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Germany). 13/27 cases (48%; 8 pattern-A, 5 benign) were correctly classified by all reviewers; 19/27 (70%; 10 pattern-A, 9 benign) were correctly classified by \u22652 reviewers. 3/13 pattern-A cases (23%) were interpreted as benign by \u22652 reviewers. Conversely, 5/14 benign cervices (36%) were misinterpreted as pattern-A by \u22652 reviewers. The number of glands per 20\u00d7 field was higher in pattern-A cases with high reviewer agreement (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). An abnormal architecture is seen in many pattern-A adenocarcinomas in support of their invasive nature; some, however, have architecture that overlaps with that of benign endocervix thus may actually represent in-situ lesions. Likewise, normal cervix can be architecturally complex and mirror patterns that pathologists would classify as pattern-A if malignant cytologic features were present. Based on this overlap and the nil risk of nodal spread, an emphasis on the non-destructive, rather than the invasive, nature of pattern-A adenocarcinoma is recommended.",

When benign tumors are taken into considerations, the benign and \u201clow malignant potential tumors\u201d represent about one third of renal masses <4\u00a0cm and one sixth of renal masses between 4 and 7\u00a0cm. All these cases have not shown recurrence or metastasis at follow-up, mean follow-up of 18 months (range 6\u221230 months).This information may assist urologists in developing guidelines for counseling and proper clinical management for patients with \u201clow malignant potential\u201d tumors or small renal masses.",

In this cross-sectional retrospective study, immunohistochemical expression of Cav-1 in the epithelial component and stroma was evaluated in 81 samples, including 12 cases of hyperkeratosis, 24 OLP, 22 epithelial dysplasia, and 23 OSCC samples. Correlations between Cav-1 expression and clinicopathological variables were evaluated statistically. Positive Cav-1 staining was found in 58% of OLP, 91% of hyperkeratosis, 100% of epithelial dysplasia, and 95% of OSCC samples. OSCC showed the highest Cav-1 expression and OLP had the lowest (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The intensity of staining was significantly increased in stepwise manner from OLP to OSCC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Expression of Cav-1 was related to the grade of samples in OSCC and dysplastic samples (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

Nephrogenic adenoma displays a broad spectrum of architectural and cytological features. Hence, recognition of its characteristic histopathological features is needed to distinguish this lesion from its mimickers.A retrospective series of 21 cases of nephrogenic adenoma in 18 patients, which were diagnosed in our department between 2010 and 2016, were analyzed. All histological slides were reviewed by two pathologists and the diagnosis of each case was confirmed. Immunohistochemistry was performed for PAX-8 in all cases. CK7, PAX-2, PSA, p53, p63, GATA-3 and \u03b1-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) were applied in problematic cases.The most common location of the lesion was urinary bladder (14 patients) followed by renal pelvis (2 patients), ureter (1 patient) and urethra (1 patient). A history of urothelial carcinoma and repeated TUR procedures were observed in 12 patients. There were 2 pediatric patients aged 3 years. Both of them had undergone previous urosurgery because of megaureter in one and bladder exstrophy in the other. Other clinical antecedents included bladder diverticulum (1 patient), cystitis (1 patient) and nephrolithiasis (1 patient). Recurrence of lesion was seen in two patients (once in one case and twice in the other one). The median time to disease recurrence in these patients was 11 months (range, 2\u201320 months). Histologically, the lesions exhibited various morphological findings, with mixed (15 cases, 71.4%), pure tubular (3 cases, 14.3%), pure papillary (2 cases, 9.5%) and pure flat (1 case, 4.8%) growth patterns. Of the 15 cases with mixed patterns, 8 cases were tubulocystic and flat, 3 cases were tubular and flat, 2 cases were tubular, papillary and flat, 1 case was tubulocystic, papillary and flat, and 1 case was tubular and papillary. Flat pattern was observed in 15 cases (71.4%). It was seen in association with other patterns in 14 cases (mixed morphology) and purely in 1 case. Our findings suggested that the flat pattern is a frequent finding in nephrogenic adenomas. Notably one case in this series showed superficial extension into bladder muscularis propria.Histologically nephrogenic adenoma may simulate a variety of malignancies. Awareness of characteristic morphologic features of nephrogenic adenoma is needed to diagnose this lesion correctly.",

Genes with genetic alterations detected in more than 20% of cases included TP53 (20/24, 83%), NOTCH1 (7/24, 29%), and MTOR (6/24, 25%). Amplification of 7 genes was detected in 8 cases. Genes showing amplification included AKT2 (1/24, 4.2%), EGFR (2/24, 8.3%), ERBB2 (HER2; 1/24, 4.2%), FGFR1 (1/24, 4.2%), KRAS (1/24, 4.2%), MDM2 (1/24, 4.2%), and PIK3CA (1/24, 4.2%). The ERBB2 alteration was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization. Patients with NF1 and ARID1A mutations were younger than the patients without the mutations. (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024 and 0.014, respectively). NOTCH1 mutation and EGFR genetic alteration were associated with a larger tumor size (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019) and lesser invasion depth (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), respectively.This study revealed the genetic profiles of ESCC, which may provide a foundation for the development of novel targeted therapy and precision medicine.",

The objective of this study which involved a relatively large number of ESCC patients was to investigate the correlated factors for lymph node metastasis and prognosis in ESCC. We analyzed a retrospective review of 446 patients with ESCC treated by esophagectomy between January 2010 and July 2016. The relationship between lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological parameters were analyzed. The association between overall survival and clinicopathological factors were evaluated using univariate and multivariable Cox regression models. In the present study, 36.8% esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients were histologically shown to have lymph node metastasis. Lymph node metastasis was closely correlated with tumor differentiation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016), perineural invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022), advanced stage tumor (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and venous invasion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with tumor size, higher T stage, perineuronal invasion, lymph node metastasis, N stage and LNR higher than 0.2 had unfavorable prognosis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The univariate analysis revealed for overall survival that tumor size, pathological stage, perineuronal invasion, lymph metastasis, N stage, involved LNR were relevant prognostic indicators. Furthermore, tumor size, lymph metastasis, N stage and LNR could as independent prognostic factors.",

P-gp could extrude anti-cancer drugs out of cancer cells and decrease effective intracellular drug concentrations. MDR reversal agents for P-gp can restore the sensitivity of MDR cells to such drugs. Saikosaponin D (SSd), one of the major triterpenoid saponins derived from Bupleurum chinense DC (BCDC), has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-infectious and anti-tumor properties. The aim of the present study was to investigate the reversal effect of SSd on MDR in MCF-7/adriamycin (ADR) human breast cancer cells and investigate the underlying mechanisms of SSd. The results demonstrated that SSd inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7/ADR and MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, SSd increased the cytotoxicity of ADR on MCF-7/ADR cells and the resistance fold of SSd treatment was demonstrated to be significantly higher when compared with that of the group without SSd treatment. Additionally, the effects of the drug combination showed that SSd and ADR combination were synergistic. Accumulation and efflux studies with the P-gp substrate, rhodamine 123 (Rh123), demonstrated that SSd restored Rh123 accumulation and inhibited P-gp-mediated drug efflux. Importantly, we found that SSd could enhance the sensitivity of MCF-7/ADR cells towards ADR by down-regulating MDR1 and P-gp expression. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that SSd may represent a potent reversal agent for P-gp-mediated MDR in breast cancer therapy.",

The authors describe a case of MST with rare squamous epithelium in a 14-month-old female. A renal mass was discovered during her fetal period. After her birth, computerized tomography revealed that the mass was localized in the inferior pole of her left kidney. She then underwent nephrectomy. The tumor was an unencapsulated but well-defined mass with a white, solid and firm cut surface and had dimensions of 4\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.5\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0cm. The tumor was initially diagnosed as Wilms tumor because its frozen section exhibited spindle cells with cartilaginous and rare squamous epithelial elements. However, the paraffin-embedded section of the tumor exhibited bland stromal cells surrounding the entrapped tubules; this arrangement produced an \u201conion-skin\u201d appearance. The rare squamous epithelial element appeared to originate from normal renal tubules. Immunohistochemistry results were positive for CD34 and INI1, as well as a low Ki-67 expression level, but were negative for S-100, Desmin, Actin, CD117 and Catenin-\u03b2. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis did not detect an ETV6 rearrangement. Morphological characteristics, immunophenotyping and molecular genetic analysis indicated MST. No recurrence or metastases occurred during the follow-up period of 36 months. Epithelial elements should be examined carefully in pediatric patients with renal masses.

     "abstract": "Evaluation of the RAS mutation status is necessary for patients with advanced colorectal cancer to predict the response to anti-EGFR therapy. In routine diagnostics, FFPE tissue samples are tested by sequencing (amplicon-based NGS and Sanger) to obtain the RAS status of the patient. Samples that are collected after chemotherapy occasionally contain necrotic tissue. Furthermore, colorectal cancer tissue sometimes has mucinous components. This may pose a challenge to molecular analysis because mucinous tumor samples often contain only few tumor cells compared to solid tumor samples. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore if mucin or necrosis affect mutation analysis and if mucinous tumor samples contain enough tumor cells for reliable mutation detection. To this end, we analyzed KRAS status in 10 samples showing mucin production and 10 samples with necrosis. In all 20 samples the tissue areas with the highest amount of mucin or necrosis were used for re-evaluation. These results show no differences with those obtained during routine diagnostics, where analysis of mucinous or necrotic areas was tried to avoid. Our study thus shows that mucin and necrosis have no influence on KRAS mutation analysis. Furthermore we were able to demonstrate that mucinous adenocarcinoma contains enough tumor cells for a valid mutation analysis. In addition, we also observed only minor differences in KRAS status results when comparing Sanger sequencing with NGS. Both methods detected the KRAS mutation in 19 of 20 tested samples, even for mutated samples with low allele-frequencies.",

SFTs are translocation-associated neoplasms that can be consistently diagnosed through the evaluation of NAB2/STAT6 gene fusion. Currently, SFTs have a different grading system and criteria according to their primary sites, and the differences and similarities in SFTs according to their primary sites are still poorly understood. Therefore, we compared SFTs according to their primary sites and histologic appearance, and validated the current grading system of SFTs.A total of 92 patients (with 15 meningeal, 40 pleural, and 37 extrapleural SFTs) were evaluated. The patients with pleural SFTs (mean age: 60.2 years) showed a significantly increased age at diagnosis. Tumors with hemangiopericytoma-predominant morphology had significantly higher grades in the evaluation of several risk factors such as cellularity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), pleomorphism (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and mitotic activity (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Consequently, hemangiopericytoma (HPC)-predominant tumors had a significantly higher recurrence rate. The meningeal SFT group had significantly higher proportion of the HPC-predominant histologic phenotype compared with pleural or extrapleural SFTs (66.67% vs. 5.00% or 18.92%, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Consequently, meningeal SFTs showed significantly higher recurrence rates compared with pleural or extrapleural SFTs (33.33% vs. 12.50% or 2.70%, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.009). Regarding the evaluation of risk factors, a tumor size \u226510\u00a0cm (P\u00a0=\u00a00.017), a mitotic index \u22654/10 high power fields (HPFs) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), high tumor cellularity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), high nuclear pleomorphism (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and tumor necrosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) were associated with both recurrence and disease-specific mortality.

Immunohistochemically, MDM2 and myogenic markers provide clues for the diagnoses. However, immunoreactivity for MDM2 and myogenic markers has not been well studied in retroperitoneal LMS and DDLS. Here, we compared the clinicopathological data of 20 retroperitoneal tumors initially diagnosed as LMS with that of 36 cases of retroperitoneal DDLS and conducted an immunohistochemical study. Four (20%) of the cases initially diagnosed as LMS were immunoreactive for MDM2. Fifteen cases (41.7%) of DDLS showed positive expression of two or more myogenic markers. The patients with LMS with MDM2 overexpression were older than the patients with LMS without MDM2 overexpression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0328). LMS with MDM2 overexpression showed a worse prognosis than DDLS (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0408). No significant difference in prognosis was found between LMS without MDM2 overexpression and DDLS with myogenic differentiation. In conclusion, we recommend that systemic MDM2 expression analysis be performed in cases of retroperitoneal sarcoma.

Strategies to prevent or reduce A\u03b2 aggregation using small molecules such as trehalose have shown beneficial effects under in vitro cell- and in vivo mouse- models. However, the role of trehalose in reducing A\u03b2 peptide aggregation is still not clear. In the present study, using circular dichroism- and fluorescence emission- spectroscopies, we demonstrated that in the presence of trehalose, A\u03b2 peptide adopts more helical content and undergoes a disorder/order conformational transition. Based on our findings, we conclude that trehalose affects the conformation of A\u03b2 peptide to form \u03b1-helical structure, which may inhibit the formation of \u03b2-sheets and thereby aggregation.",

However, genetic features as driver mutations or potential therapeutic targets are not fully elucidated. Recent a few studies have shown that SCs have concurrently multiple mutations including RAS/RAF/MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways via next-generation sequencing in western population. Because we recently demonstrated absence of KRAS mutations in Korean eyelid SCs, we extended our previous study to the analysis of NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and CTNNB1 mutations, and the examination of related protein expressions in 15 eyelid SCs.Repeated molecular analysis by peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping method, PNA clamping-assisted fluorescence melting curve analysis, and direct sequencing revealed that all eyelid SCs had wild type alleles of NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA in hotspot exon locations. Only silent mutations in the CTNNB1 gene (p.Q61Q) were identified. Using immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability analysis, they harbored all intact mismatch repair gene proteins with microsatellite stability. Membranous and cytoplasmic \u03b2-catenin staining was found in all tumors, whereas the one third of those tumors showed cyclin D1 overexpression, of which 40% and 80% showed p53 expression and p16 expression, respectively.The lack of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation in our study may suggest that a subset of eyelid SCs is unlike that of eyelid SCs of western countries. The mismatch repair gene proteins and microsatellite instability analysis as a screening test for Muir-Torre syndrome may be limited in the Korean eyelid SCs.",

The most common type of primary central nervous system lymphoma is diffuse large B-cell type with poor prognosis and the reason is unclear. This study aims to stratify primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (PCNS-DLBCL) according to the cell-of-origin (COO) and to investigate the multiple proteins expression of C-MYC, BCL-6, BCL-2, TP53, further to elucidate the reason why primary central nervous system diffuse large B-cell lymphoma possesses a poor clinical outcome as well. Nineteen cases of primary central nervous system DLBCL were stratified according to immunostaining algorithms of Hans, Choi and Meyer (Tally) and we investigated the multiple proteins expression of C-MYC, BCL-6, BCL-2, TP53. The Epstein-Barr virus and Borna disease virus infection were also detected. Among nineteen cases, most (15\u201317 cases) were assigned to the activated B-cell-like subtype, highly expression of C-MYC (15 cases, 78.9%), BCL-2 (10 cases, 52.6%), BCL-6 (15 cases, 78.9%). Unfortunately, two cases were positive for PD-L1 while PD-L2 was not expressed in any case. Two cases infected with BDV but no one infected with EBV. In conclusion, most primary central nervous system DLBCLs show an activated B-cell-like subtype characteristic and have multiple expressions of C-MYC, BCL-2, BCL-6 protein, these features might be significant factor to predict the outcome and guide treatment of PCNS-DLBCLs.",

Overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) induces the excessive apoptosis of IECs and is involved in CD development. PRDM5 (PR domain containing 5 PFM2) a member of PRDM family, reportedly acts as a transcriptional regulator involved in tissue specific differentiation and tumor development. In this study, we investigated PRDM5 expression and its potential functions in both human CD (Crohn\u2019s disease) and TNBS (2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid sol)-induced mice experimental colitis. As shown by western blot and immunohistochemistry, significant up-regulation of PRDM5 was found in the inflamed intestinal tissues of CD patients and TNBS-treated mice, and the molecule was mainly located in IECs. To explore the biological functions of PRDM5 in IEC apoptosis, we established the interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) induced cellular apoptosis model on human IEC line HT29 in vitro. IFN-\u03b3 significantly increased the expression of PRDM5 in a both time-dependent and concentration-dependent manner in HT29 cells, which was accompanied with an up-regulated expression of apoptotic markers (active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP(poly (ADP-ribpse) polymerase)). Inhibiting PRDM5 expression by siRNA attenuated the IFN-\u03b3-triggered accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP in IECs. Moreover, flow cytometry assay and CCK-8 analysis revealed that PRDM5 knockdown significantly alleviated the IFN-\u03b3-induced cellular apoptosis in HT29 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that highly expressed PRDM5 may promote the IFN-\u03b3-induced IEC apoptosis in the progression of CD.",

After our analysis of the gene expression dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we focused on claudin 6 (CLDN 6). The status of CLDN 6 was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 61 samples of MFS and other (benign) myxoid soft tissue tumors (28 myxoma samples, 12 nodular fasciitis samples), 18 low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, 30 myxoid liposarcoma, 29 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma and 27 dedifferentiated liposarcoma with myxoid feature samples. The correlation between the expression of CLDN 6 and clinicopathological findings in MFS was also investigated. Immunohistochemically, high expression of CLDN 6 was observed in approx. 65% of the MFSs, whereas the benign soft tissue tumors did not show a high expression of CLDN 6. The expression of CLDN 6 in the MFS was significantly higher than those of other tumor specimens. Among the MFSs, the high expression of CLDN 6 was correlated with high FNCLCC grades and high AJCC stages. CLDN 6 may be useful for the differential diagnosis from benign myxoid tumor and for predicting the aggressive biological behavior of MFS.",

We aimed to identify signatures to play a predictive role in nodal metastasis for analytic validation between the primary breast cancers with positive node metastasis and those with negative node metastasis.We validated expression profiles of surrogate candidates extracted from the prior 2D MALDI-TOF data for invasive breast cancer using fluorescence/silver in situ hybridization (FISH/SISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 151 primary breast cancers accompanied with 102 metastatic nodal tissues. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses indicated that event factors (recurrence or metastasis) were significantly more frequent in cases with CCDN1, c-myc gene amplification, IgHA2 low expression. CCDN1 gene amplification (OR: 5.702, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0006), IgHA2 low expression (OR: 0.16, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0184) remained significant factors for events on multivariate analyses. WDR+/ERK++ was significantly detected in higher pN stage (averaging 6.5 regional nodes or 43% of NPR), while seldom found in pN0-1.In conclusion, both overexpression of WDR1 and p-ERK in the primary breast cancer could play a role in the nodal signature over pN2-3.",

Herein, we showed that NS was upregulated in HCC tissues and the expression of NS was inversely correlated with that of p53. Overexpression of NS predicted significantly worsened prognosis in HCC patients, suggesting that NS might serve as a prognostic marker of HCC. In addition, we found that depletion of NS sensitized HCC cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, we found that the mechanism underlying NS-mediated sorafenib resistance involved dysregulated expression of p53, and downstream Bax and Bcl-2 proteins. NS interacted with p53 in HCC cells. Depletion of NS increased the expression of p53 and Bax, whereas impaired the level of cellular Bcl-2. Interference of NS enhanced the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in HCC cells. Furthermore, ectopic expression of NS impaired the apoptosis of HCC cells following sorafenib exposure. Therefore, NS may contribute to sorafenib resistance in HCC cells through the modulation of p53 pathway and Bcl-2 proteins. These findings indicated that the combination of silencing NS expression and sorafenib treatment is a promising therapeutic strategy in treatment of HCC.",

More than one histological pattern was identified in each mammary tumor. Carcinomas constituted the lesions most frequently induced by both carcinogens: 33 MNU-induced carcinomas and 23 DMBA-induced carcinomas.

The higher KI-67 PI and MAI in MNU-induced mammary carcinomas are suggestive of a higher aggressiveness of these carcinomas when compared with the DMBA-induced ones, and consequently a worse response to the therapy and a worse prognosis. In this way, the use of the rat model of MNU-induced mammary tumors is advised in experimental protocols aiming to study more aggressive mammary tumors within the group of double-positive mammary tumors (ER+/PR+).",

     "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel type of endogenous RNAs featuring stable structure and high tissue-specific expression. Recently, accumulating evidence has revealed that aberrant circRNAs expression plays important roles in carcinogenesis and tumor progression. However, the expression pattern and biological function of circRNAs in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to clarify the possible role of one of typical circRNAs, circRNA_100876 in NSCLC and to define its prognostic value in NSCLC. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of circRNA_100876 in tumor tissues and their adjacent nontumorous tissues in 101 patients with NSCLC. We found that the expression level of circRNA_100876 was significantly elevated in NSCLC tissues when compared with their adjacent nontumorous tissues (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000). Moreover, there was a close correlation between the circRNA_100876 up-regulation expression and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and tumor staging (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) in NSCLC. In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that the overall survival time of NSCLC patients with high circRNA_100876 expression was significantly shorter than those patients with low circRNA_100876 expression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000). In conclusion, our findings indicate that circRNA_100876 is closely related to the carcinogenesis of NSCLC and it might be served as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for NSCLC.",

Adeno-associated virus (AAV) may interact with human papillomavirus (HPV) to modify the risk of cervical neoplasia. The seroprevalence of AAV among women with cervical cancer has been reported to be lower than healthy ones. In spite of this finding, detection of AAV DNA in cervical biopsies does not entirely support the inverse association between AAV seropositivity and cervical cancer. This association is still controversial and requires more thorough evaluation in different countries. The aim of this case\u2013control study was to find the prevalence of AAV and HPV DNA sequences in Iranian women with and without cervical cancer to assess the probable association of AAV infection and cervical cancer. In this study, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of 61 cervical cancer cases and 50 healthy controls (HCs) were investigated for AAV and HPV DNA by semi-nested and nested PCRs respectively. AAV DNA was detected in 7 cases (14%) of HCs and 9 specimens (14.8%) of case group. According to the branching in the phylogenetic tree, AAV2 was the only type detected in this study. Moreover, HPV DNA was detected in 8 cases (16%) of HCs and 44 specimens (72.13%) of case group. In conclusion, a low proportion of cervical biopsies from Iranian women contained AAV-2 genome. No significant difference in correlation between HPV and cervical cancer in presence or absence of AAV genome in cervix was found.",

The bone location as primary location is extremely rare and few cases are reported. We present three cases arising in bone with molecular confirmation using both RT-PCR and FISH analysis. Patients include two men and one woman with an age of 62, 69 and 73 years old. The mean size of the lesion was 13\u00a0cm (range 8\u201318\u00a0cm). Tumors arose in the iliac bone in two cases and in the proximal humerus in the other case. At time of diagnosis the three cases show bone cortex and soft tissue involvement. On imaging, lesions have a lobular pattern, are purely lytic, but take up contrast medium after injection. Two patients are alive with disease (local recurrence and lung metastasis) after five years and five years and six months, respectively and one patient died of disease two years after the diagnosis. The primary extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma of bone seems to have a more aggressive behavior than the soft tissue counterpart. The molecular confirmation of diagnosis using RT-PCR is necessary to do the differential diagnosis with other entities, in particular with myoepithelioma that shows similar morphological features and EWSR1 and FUS genes rearrangement.",

We herein indicated miR-26a performed converse roles on oncogenicity in different gastric cancer cells. In gastric cancer cells MKN-28, miR-26a promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. However, in gastric cancer cells AGS, miR-26a reduced cell proliferation and metastasis. PTEN was identified as a direct target of miR-26a. In MKN-28 cells, PTEN was suppressed by miR-26a through 3\u2032-UTR, and PTEN mediated miR-26a promoting oncogenicity including cell proliferation and metastasis. On the other hand, in AGS cells, the expression of PTEN was enhanced by miR-26a, and PTEN mediated miR-26a reducing oncogenicity. The mechanism in AGS cells may be the indirect regulation of PTEN by miR-26a overcame the direct targeting regulation. The model like MKN-28 cells was concordant with patients with a high level of miR-26a and a low level of PTEN and patients with a low level of miR-26a and a high level of PTEN which showed lower overall survival (OS); the model like AGS cells was concordant with patients with both high level of miR-26a and PTEN and both low level of miR-26a and PTEN which showed higher OS.

     "abstract": "Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a highly fatal disease with poor prognosis and few therapeutic alternatives. Molecular profiling has revealed that the deregulation in the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway plays a crucial role in many disease and malignancies, including GBC. The aim of this study was to measure the expression of ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 in a population with high GBC-related mortality, such as the Chilean population, and characterize the protein expression of this ERK/MAPK pathway in seven GBC cell lines. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 was performed in 123 GBC tissues and 37 chronic cholecystitis (CC) tissues. In addition, protein expression analysis by western blot for ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3 were performed in seven GBC cell lines (GB-d1, G415, NOZ, OCUG-1, TGBC-1, TGBC-2 and TGBC-24). A higher ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 expression was found in GBC tissues compared to chronic cholecystitis (CC) tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). However, neither significant differences in overall survival nor significant associations with any of the clinicopathological features were found by comparing low and high expression of both ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2. Western blot analysis of seven GBC cell lines showed that, in general, GB-d1, G415 and NOZ cells evidenced a strong expression of ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, EGFR, ERBB2 and ERBB3. Therefore, ERK1/2 and p-ERK1/2 seem to be important in the development of GBC and GB-d1, G415 and NOZ cell lines may be used as experimental models for further in vitro and in vivo studies that help to decipher the role of MAPK/ERK pathway in gallbladder carcinogenesis.",

MPII induced apoptosis in both cell lines, which was observed by light microscopy and flow cytometry. MPII-induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest were quantified by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. At the molecular level, MPII induced caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and cytochrome c gene expression. In vivo, MPII dramatically inhibited human liver tumor growth in a xenograft model in Kunming mice with no apparent cytotoxicity to the hosts. Apoptotic genes (Bcl-2 and Bax) are up-regulated, suggesting that the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax was statistically significant, indicating that the drugs had affected the expression of apoptosis genes, especially on induce apoptosis gene Bax. We also observed an attenuated effect when MPII was used in combination with chemotherapy drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). The mice treated with 5-FU alone did not show a concentration-dependent effect, but 5-FU in combination with MPII displayed concentration-dependent effects on liver cancer cells. Our study suggests that MPII works by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and has the potential to be a powerful anticancer agent.",

Neutrophilic granulocytes (NG) were quantified by the CD15 focus score on the basis of the principle of focal maximum infiltration (focus) with evaluation of one field of vision (about 0.3\u00a0mm2). The quantification values were compared with the microbiological diagnoses taking into consideration the virulence groups of low-virulence and high-virulence microbial pathogens and mixed infection.The patients with positive microbiological findings (n\u00a0=\u00a0160) had significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Mann-Whitney U test) higher CD15 focus score values than patients with negative microbiological findings (n\u00a0=\u00a0115), the cut-off value being 39 cells per high power field (HPF). The CD15 focus score values of low-virulence microbial pathogens (n\u00a0=\u00a094) were significantly lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Mann-Whitney U test) than the values of high-virulence microbial pathogens (n\u00a0=\u00a055), the cut-off value being 106 cells per HPF. Based on the microbiological diagnosis the sensitivity with respect to a microbial infection is 0.91, the specificity 0.92 (PPV\u00a0=\u00a00.94; NPV\u00a0=\u00a00.88; accuracy: 0.92; AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.95). Based on the differentiation of the CD15 focus score values between low-virulence and high-virulence microbes the sensitivity is 0.70 and the specificity 0.77 (PPV\u00a0=\u00a00.63; NPV\u00a0=\u00a00.81; accuracy\u00a0=\u00a00.74; AUC\u00a0=\u00a00.74).As a result of the high sensitivity and specificity, the easy to use CD15 focus score is a diagnostically valid score for microbial periprosthetic infection. A differentiation between low-virulence and high-virulence microorganism of sufficiently high diagnostic quality is additionally possible as a result of the defined quantification of CD15 positive granulocytes (the CD15 focus score) histopathological diagnosis of microbial infections is possible, which on the one hand supports the microbiological diagnosis and on the other hand by the stratification into low-virulence and high-virulence microbial pathogens could represent an additional basis for a pathogen-specific antibiotic treatment in the event of unclear constellations of findings.",

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between DCM (or ICM) and controls. Gene functions were investigated, and their associations were analyzed using Enrichmentmap plugin in Cytoscape. Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between DEGs were determined, and DEGs with high degree were defined as key DEGs. Potential TFs of key DEGs were predicted using iRegulon plugin. Common DEGs were found, and their functional interactions were investigated using GeneMANIA.A total of 362 and 300 DEGs were respectively identified for DCM and ICM in comparison with controls, and these DEGs mainly participated in similar functions about extracellular region, membrane, immune process, and defense response. PPI networks were respectively constructed for DCM and ICM, and 26 key DEGs (e.g. CXCL10, IL6, TLR3, and VCAM1) were found, which might be targeted by 35 TFs (e.g. IRF1). Besides, 47 common up-regulated DEGs were found, which participated in 14 pathways like Apoptosis, Collagen formation, as well as 127 common down-regulated DEGs that involved in 20 pathways like Adaptive immune system, Interferon \u03b3 signaling (e.g. IRF1, VCAM1), and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway (e.g. CXCL10, IL6, TLR3).DCM and ICM may share similar mechanism, and TFs (e.g. IRF1) play crucial roles in their development via regulating gene expression.",

In Italy the intestinal form occurs almost as frequently as the gastric form, which is far more frequent in Japan. Intestinal Anisakiasis represents a diagnostic challenge as it is clinically misdiagnosed and most of the patients require surgery due to the occurrence of complications such as bowel occlusion or perforation. Practically no cases of the intestinal form are diagnosed preoperatively.

The development of all malignant tumors in all cases was accompanied by the presence of benign precancerous processes. Analysis of neoplasia histology shows the predominance of poorly differentiated forms of cancers in women with increased aggressiveness of cancerous tissue in each subsequent case and the growth of metastatic ability.

     "abstract": "Survivin is the smallest member of the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) family. However, participation in inhibition of apoptosis is not the only function of this molecule. Survivin can also affect the proper process of mitosis and even promoting of angiogenesis or DNA repair. High levels of survivin expression are connected with foetal tissues during intrauterine development. In the overwhelming majority of healthy, differentiated adult tissues, amounts of survivin are markedly reduced. On the other hand, survivin is also often abundantly expressed in cases of various types of cancer. Generally, high expression levels of survivin are associated with a poor prognosis, an increased rate of tumour recurrence and high resistance to chemo- as well as radiotherapy, hence survivin can be considered a factor in the initiation and progression of many types of cancer with great significance and potential for cancer therapy. Nonetheless, progress in development of survivin inhibitors or primarily, in survivin-related molecular therapies, is surprisingly not very fast and indeed remains a challenge for the future. The objective of this article is to summarize known facts about survivin, its contribution to inhibition of apoptosis and cell division and its implication in the development of gynaecological tumours. At the end, known survivin inhibitors and their effect on regulation of tumour growth will be referenced.",

This retrospective case-control study aims to examine the placental features associated FMH in patients with known positive KB test results. When compared with KB negative placentas (n\u00a0=\u00a088), KB positive placentas (n\u00a0=\u00a049) had significantly higher incidence of pallor (6/49 vs 0/88, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0017), IVT (11/49 vs. 5/88, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0032) and nRBCs (12/49 vs. 4/88, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0008). Autopsy cases with fetal or neonatal death due to FMH, (n\u00a0=\u00a013) compared to a cohort of 162 placentas associated with other, non-FMH causes of death also had significantly higher frequency of pallor (5/13 vs 0/162, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), IVT (6/13 vs 24/162, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and nRBCs (11/13 vs 67/162, p\u00a0=\u00a00.003).

The purpose of this study was to identify dysregulated pathways of great potential functional relevance in the progression of HCC.Microarray data of 72 pairs of tumor and matched non-tumor surrounding tissues of HCC were transformed to gene expression data. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between patients and normal controls were identified using Linear Models for Microarray Analysis. Personalized dysregulated pathways were identified using individualized pathway aberrance score module.169 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were obtained with |logFC|\u00a0\u2265\u00a01.5 and P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01. 749 dysregulated pathways were obtained with P\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.01 in pathway statistics, and there were 93 DEG overlapped in the dysregulated pathways. After performing normal distribution analysis, 302 pathways with the aberrance probability\u00a0\u2265\u00a00.5 were identified.

The MLH1 protein expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays including 121 primary CRC and 90 lung cancer patient samples. In cancer cell lines, the methylation status of MLH1 promoter and exon 2 was investigated by bisulfite sequencing (BS). Methylation-specific-PCR (MSP) was used to evaluate methylation status of MLH1.The expression of MLH1 mRNA was detected in 8 CRC cell lines as well as normal colonic fibroblast cells CCD-33Co. At protein levels, MLH1 was lost in one CRC cell line HCT-116 and normal cells CCD-33Co. No methylation was found in the promoter and exon 2 of MLH1 in CRC cell lines. MLH1 was expressed in 8 lung cancer cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels. Compared to cancer cells, normal bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) had lower expression of MLH1 protein.

MSP analysis showed that 58 out of 92 (63.0%) CRC and 41 out of 73 (56.2%) lung cancer exhibited MLH1 methylation. In CRC, the MLH1 methylation was significantly associated with tumor invasion in veins (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012). However, no significant links were found between MLH1 expression and promoter methylation in both tumor entities.MLH1 methylation is a frequent molecular event in CRC and lung cancer patients. In CRC, methylation of MLH1 could be linked to vascular invasiveness.",

Uni-/multivariable COX-regression analyses showed that greater expression of both survivin and TII\u03b1 were associated with poorer survival when stratified for IDH1-mutation status and, additionally, achieved hazard rates surpassing clinically established prognostic factors such as age and WHO performance status. Ki67 achieved only statistical significance in univariable analyses, whereas mitoses did not reveal any relation to survival. IDH1-mutated astrocytomas had significantly better survival than astrocytomas, NOS. Among IDH1-mutated astrocytomas no significant difference in survival was shown between DA and AA.

Seventy one cases of endometrial carcinoma and 30 cases of benign and normal endometrium were employed for the detection of galectin-3 protein using tissue microarrays and immunohistochemistry staining. Thirty nine (55%) cases, including 54.2% of endometrioid adenocarcinomas and 55.5% serous carcinomas, were positively stained for galectin-3. Brown granular expression of this glycoprotein was detected in transformed epithelial cells of 36 cases including 28 cases with membranous and cytoplasmic staining and 8 cases with only cytoplasmic staining; nuclear expression was present in stromal cells of the remaining 3 cases. Twenty-four (80%) control cases showed granular cytoplasmic and membranous expression, and six control cases were negative. Tumor grade, stage and differentiation were significantly associated with galectin-3 immunoreactivity (p-values are 0.043, 0.016, and 0.044 respectively), cases with membranous and cytoplasmic staining is significantly associated with grade I and stage II, while cases with loss of staining are more frequent in grade II, III and poorly differentiated tumors. No significant association of galectin-3 staining was observed with age, diagnosis, recurrence and alive status. The current study supports the tumor suppression role of galectin-3 in endometrial carcinoma. Greater galectin-3 immunostaining has been found in control endometrial tissues compared to endometrial tumors. Loss or decreased galectin-3 immunoexpression gives a sign for poor prognoses in endometrial carcinoma patients.",

However, the relationship between miR-375 and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is controversial.We first evaluated the 23 LUSCs and the paired normal lung tissues by qRT-PCR. Then we analyzed the LUSC samples with miR-375 expression based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis was performed to explore the biological role of miR-375 in LUSC.The expression of miR-375 was remarkably reduced in LUSC tissues compared with that in paired lung tissues by qRT-PCR (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Additionally, the TCGA dataset suggested that miR-375 was significantly downregulated in 478 LUSC tissues compared with 45 normal lung tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001), as well as the result derived from GEO datasets (the pooled SMD\u00a0=\u00a0\u22121.01; 95%CIs-1.66 to \u22120.33, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004).

In the case of failure of resident hepatocytes to restore loss, repopulation is carried out by induction, proliferation, and differentiation of the progenitor cell. Although, some signaling pathways have been verified to contribute oval cell-mediated liver regeneration, role of Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1(Pin1) in the oval cells proliferation is unknown. In the present study, we evaluate the role of Pin1 in oval cells proliferation. In our study, the expression of Pin1 in the mice liver increased after three weeks feeding of 3, 5-diethoxycarbonyl-1, 4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) diet along with the proliferation of oval cells. The expression of Pin1 was higher in oval cells compared to the hepatocytes.Pin1 inhibition by Juglone reduced oval cell proliferation, which was restored to normal when oval cells were treated with IGF-1. Consistent with increased cell growth, expression of Pin1, \u03b2-catenin and PCNA were increased in IGF-1 treated cells in a time dependent manner. In FACS analysis, siRNA-mediated knockdown of the Pin1 protein in the oval cells significantly increased the numbers of cells in G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, hepatocyte when treated with TGF-\u03b2 showed marked reduction in cell proliferation and expression of Pin1 whereas this effect was not seen in the oval cells treated with TGF-\u03b2. In conclusion, Pin1 plays important role in the cell cycle progression and increase oval cells proliferation which may be crucial in chronic liver injury.",

Although MET and HGF are commonly expressed in biliary tract cancers, their expression and gene copy number status and their association with KRAS mutations have not been investigated in pancreatobiliary-type ampullary adenocarcinomas (A-ACs), one of the aggressive periampullary cancers. MET and HGF expressions and MET copy number status were examined by performing immunohistochemistry (IHC) and silver in situ hybridization (SISH) in 62 surgically resected, paraffin-embedded tumors, respectively. High MET and HGF protein expressions were detected in 24 (38.7%) and 15 (24.2%) tumors. High MET expression was associated with KRAS mutation. However, there were no associations of high MET/HGF expression alone with other clinicopathological feature or survival. MET SISH positivity was detected in 19 tumors (30.6%), where 84.2% were due to high trisomy or polysomy and only 3 cases (15.8%) were MET gene amplification. The overall MET protein overexpression was well correlated with MET SISH positivity. The concurrent MET SISH positivity and KRAS mutation, not each alone, was an independent poor prognostic factor of disease-free survival only in pancreatobiliary subtype of A-ACs, but not in intestinal subtype.Concurrent MET SISH positivity and KRAS mutation may predict a high risk of recurrence in pancreatobiliary subtype of A-ACs, indicating those markers could be potent candidates for a new therapeutic target in this cancer type.

     "abstract": "Melanoma is a highly aggressive tumor of the skin. The clinical outcome is determined by the presence or absence of metastases, and the liver is a common site of distant metastases. Hepatic metastasis is causing activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSC), which form the stroma of hepatic metastases and are increasingly recognized as a crucial component of the pro- metastatic liver microenvironment. Most studies have focused on the effects of HSC on (metastasizing) tumor cells. Here, we aimed to analyze functional in vitro effects of conditioned medium (CM) of twelve different human melanoma cell lines on LX2 cells and HSChtert cells, two well established human activated HSC cell lines. CM from melanoma cells significantly induced HSC proliferation and acted as chemoattractant for HSC in Boyden chamber assays. The CM effects significantly varied between different HSC as well as melanoma cells. Interestingly, CM from melanoma cell lines derived from melanoma metastases (WM239A, WM9, WM1158, WM1232, 451Lu and 1205Lu) had a stronger effect on proliferation of HSChtert cells than CM derived from primary melanoma tumors (SbCl2, WM3211, WM35, WM278, WM1366 and WM793). Moreover, we observed a significant correlation between the chemoattractive effects of CM from the different melanoma cells on HSChtert and LX2 cells. In contrast, the melanoma CM effects on the proliferation of the two HSC lines did not show a significant correlation. In summary, our data indicate that melanoma cells metastasizing to the liver have the potential to attract HSC and to induce HSC proliferation, respectively. Still, it appears that melanoma effects on HSC migration and proliferation are mediated via different soluble factors indicating the complexity of melanoma-HSC interaction. Furthermore, the intensity of at least some functional effects varies between different human tumor cells and HSC which may point to mechanisms explaining diverse hepatic metastasis in melanoma patients.",

We also found that protein expression levels of BRAFV600E and NF-\u03baB were greater in TgAb-positive patients compared with TgAb-negative PTC patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). Immunoreactivity scores of BRAFV600E and NF-\u03baB in TgAb-positive PTC patients with bilateral tumor foci, lymph node metastases, HT and imaging-documented disease was highest. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymph node metastases significantly correlated with NF-\u03baB levels and TgAb levels (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004, p\u00a0=\u00a00.014).The expression levels of BRAFV600E and NF-\u03baB were significantly greater in TgAb-positive than in TgAb-negative PTC patients. In PTC, overexpression of NF-\u03baB, as well as positive TgAb, may be a risk factor for cervical lymph node metastasis.",

     "abstract": "Gallbladder cancer is the most common biliary tract cancer and the fifth most common cancer of the digestive system. However, the clinicopathologic features of gallbladder cancer in young Korean patients have not been studied. This study included 101 consecutive cases of gallbladder cancer that underwent cholecystectomy at Kangbuk Samsung Hospital from December 1990 to March 2011. The patients were divided into two groups by age at initial diagnosis of gallbladder cancer: a young patient group aged less than 45 years and an old patient group aged 45 or older. The young patient group included 10 patients with mean age of 38 (range, 29\u201344 years). Compared with the old patient group, the young patient group showed polypoid tumor appearance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), lower pT stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023), more frequent adenoma background (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), and less frequent dysplasia in remaining mucosa (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The disease-related survival rate after 13.5 months was significantly more favorable for the young patients. Gallbladder cancers in young Korean patients have distinct clinicopathologic features of a high frequency of cancer arising in adenoma, rare association with intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia, and a favorable patient\u2019s prognosis. These findings suggest that the adenoma-carcinoma pathway could contribute more to gallbladder cancer carcinogenesis in young Korean patients than the metaplasia-dysplasia-carcinoma pathway.",

In this study, to analyze the expression pattern of miR-19a and to investigate its clinical implication in human osteosarcomas, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect expression levels of miR-19a in 166 self-pairs of osteosarcoma and noncancerous bone tissues. Associations between miR-19a expression and various clinicopathological parameters and patients' prognosis of osteosarcomas were further evaluated. As a results, miR-19a expression in osteosarcoma tissues was significantly higher than that in corresponding noncancerous bone tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Osteosarcoma patients with high miR-19a expression more frequently had large tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03), advanced clinical stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01), positive distant metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and poor response to chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) than those with low miR-19a expression. Additionally, kaplan-Meier analysis showed that both overall and disease-free survivals of osteosarcoma patients with high miR-19a expression were shorter than those with low miR-19a expression (both P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Further multivariate analysis identified miR-19a expression as an independent prognostic factor for both overall (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and disease-free (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006) survivals. In conclusion, the aberrant expression of miR-19a may play a crucial role in development and progression of human osteosarcomas.

     "abstract": "Among the several organs affected by perinatal hypoxia, the heart plays a central role, with cell death caused mainly by apoptosis. One of the biomarkers most often linked to hypoxia-derived apoptosis of cardiomyocytes in animals is Gadd45\u03b2. From the published literature, Gadd45\u03b2 is proposed as a biomarker of hypoxia-induced lesion in cardiomyocytes, both in vitro, as well as in animal models. Our study suggests that this protein can be used as an early biomarker of cell damage in neonate\u2019s cardiomyocytes (humans specimens), a process that can ultimately lead to apoptosis. The aim is to determine levels of tissue immunoexpression of the Gadd45\u03b2 biomarker in myocardium samples of newborns affected by hypoxia, and to correlate these results with clinical and anatomopathologic data.Myocardium samples from the left ventricle of newborns were used. The samples were collected from 78 autopsies performed in neonates of both genders, with hypoxia (Apgar score at five minutes below 6 and/or pH below 7.2 and/or autopsy with anatomopathological signs of hypoxia), who had died within the first day of life. All samples were organized in Tissue Microarray. Immunohistochemistry analysis, using anti-Gadd45\u03b2 as the primary antibody, was performed on 3 multi-sample histological slides. There was no correlation between Gadd45\u03b2 tissue immunoexpression and neonatal weight (p\u00a0=\u00a00.93), gestational age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.16), Apgar score at first minute (p\u00a0=\u00a00.914), Apgar score at five minutes (p\u00a0=\u00a00.988) and arterial blood pH (p\u00a0=\u00a00.542).

The maximum peak of Gadd45\u03b2 tissue immunoexpression was 8.43% HPF (high power field) and was observed around of six hours of life.Gadd45\u03b2 could be a suitable biomarker of cardiomyocytes apoptosis in newborns experiencing hypoxia in the first day of life, as its highest tissue immunoexpression around at the first six hours after birth.",

Recently, different authors reported that head and neck squamous cell carcinomas have a subpopulation of tumor initiating cells that apparently correspond to cancer stem cells (CSC) and are also responsible for tumor growth and metastasis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the microscopic and phenotypic characteristics of OSCC tumors induced after orthotopic xenoimplantation of SCC9WT cell line and CSC-enriched subpopulation isolated from SCC9 cell line based on high expression of the putative CSC marker CD44. Different numbers of FACS-sorted SCC9 CD44high and CD44low cells as well as SCC9WT (wild type) were transplanted into the tongue of BALB/C nude (NOD/SCID) mice to evaluate their tumorigenic potential. Sixty days post-induction, tumors were morphologically characterized and immunostained for CSC markers (CD44, Nanog and Bmi-1), epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Snail, Slug) and epithelial differentiating cell markers (cytokeratins 4, 13, 15, 17 and 19), as well as E-cadherin and \u03b2-catenin. The data presented here shows that SCC9 CD44high cells have higher ability to form tumors than SCC9 CD44low cells, even when significantly lower numbers of SCC9 CD44high cells were transplanted. Immunoassessment of tumors derived from SCC9 CD44high cells revealed high expression of cytokeratin CK19, \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin and CD44, and negative or low expression of CK17, CK4, CK15, CK13, Nanog, Bmi-1, Snail and Slug. While tumors derived from SCC9WT showed high expression of CK17, CK19, CD44, Nanog, Bmi-1, Snail and Slug, and negative or low expression of CK4, CK15, CK13, \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin. Thus, SCC9 CD44high cells were highly tumorigenic, capable of originating heterogeneous tumors and these tumors have a immunohistochemical profile different from those formed by the wild type cell line.",

In our previous research, we have demonstrated that HCC-derived Tregs can interfere with Dendritic cells (DCs) function and down-modulate CD80/CD86 on DCs in vitro in a cell-contact dependent way. However the mechanism of how HCC-derived Treg affect DC phenotype are not very clear. Therefore, we investigated the function of CTLA-4 in anti-tumor immune responses.We established BABL/C mouse with hepatocellular carcinoma model, and tumor-derived Tregs were purified by magnetic cell sorting using mouse CD4\u00a0+\u00a0CD25\u00a0+\u00a0regulatory\u00a0T cell isolation kit.

HCC-derived Tregs down-modulated CD80/CD86 on DCs in a CTLA-4-dependent way. Blockade of CTLA-4 can lead to increase DC-mediated immunity.CTLA-4 play a vital role in Treg-mediated immnue inhibition and this discovery can open up new ideas for the development of therapeutic strategies.",

Acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL) activate free fatty acids by synthesis of acyl-CoA thioesters. ACSL isoform 5 (ACSL5) is involved in enterocytic differentiation and maturation by regulating both pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects. Whilst impaired expression of ACSL5 has been associated with sporadic colorectal carcinogenesis, little is known about ACSL5 as a prognostic factor. Aim of this retrospective study was to characterize the prognostic impact of ACSL5 expression levels in sporadic colorectal adenocarcinomas. A total of 72 patients with a median follow-up of 54 months was included. Using a standardized immunohistochemical approach, colorectal adenocarcinomas with low (n\u00a0=\u00a041; group 1) or high (n\u00a0=\u00a031; group 2) ACSL5 levels were identified.

Frequency of lymph node metastasis and mortality was not different between the groups. In a long-time follow-up no differences were found between the ACSL5 groups. The data indicate that ACSL5 could be an independent prognostic factor for early recurrence of sporadic colorectal adenocarcinoma.",

Recent studies show that LXR agonists exhibit anti-cancer activities in a variety of cancer cell lines including prostate. To further identify the potential mechanisms of LXR\u03b1 activation on prostate cancer, we investigated the effect of LXR agonist T0901317 on PC3 prostate cancer cell and in which activity of beta-catenin pathway involved.Prostate cancer PC3 cells were transfected with LXR-a siRNA and treated with LXR activator T0901317. qRT-PCR and western blot were used to detect the LXR-a expression. beta-catenin, cyclin D1 and c-MYC were analyzed by western blot. Cell apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry and Cell proliferation was assessed by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. Cell migration was detected by Transwell chambers.Data showed that T0901317 significantly inhibited PC3 cell proliferation as well as invasion and increased apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, we found that LXR\u03b1 activation induced the reduction of beta-catenin expression in PC3 cells, and this inhibitory effect could be totally abolished when cells were treated with LXR\u03b1. Meanwhile, the expression of beta-catenin target gene cyclin D1 and c-MYC were also decreased.This study provided additional evidence that LXR activation inhibited PC-3 prostate cancer cells via suppressing beta-catenin pathway.",

The association between cystic kidney disease and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is well known, but its presentation as a unilateral mass with glomerulocystic pattern is rare. We describe a case of an infant with a prenatal diagnosis of TSC, with a renal mass that was believed to be a renal tumor.A four-month-old infant with maternal history of TSC and prenatally diagnosed subependymal nodules and a right renal mass underwent nephrectomy. Histopathology revealed a segmental GCK with epithelial hyperplasia of the tubules and cysts. A diagnosis of TSC associated GCK was rendered. Eight other cases with similar histopathological findings were found in the literature, two of which presented as a localized mass. Usually there is no family history but the pathologic findings are similar.Awareness of the entity and its presentation as a localized mass may aid in the differential diagnosis of renal masses in infants. The pre-operative diagnosis of GCK is difficult and relies on a high degree of clinical awareness and imaging skills. Its presence should prompt the search for its etiology, particularly the exclusion of a heritable cause. The hyperplastic tubular epithelium within the glomerular cysts found in ours and other reported cases seems so characteristic that may serve as a major clue for the diagnosis of TSC.",

Psoriasis is characterized by hyperproliferation and impaired differentiation of keratinocytes in skin lesions. miR-194 is a well-known regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation. However, the role of miR-194 in psoriasis pathogenesis remains unclear. In this study we aimed to investigate the role of miR-194 in keratinocyte hyperproliferation and differentiation. We found that miR-194 was significantly downregulated in psoriasis lesional skin. Overexpression of miR-194 inhibited the proliferation and promoted the differentiation of primary human keratinocytes, whereas miR-194 suppression promoted the proliferation and inhibited their differentiation. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that the Grainyhead-like 2 (GRHL2) was a target gene of miR-194, which we further validated with a dual-luciferase reporter assay, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and Western blot analysis. The effect of miR-194 on cell proliferation and differentiation was significantly reversed by overexpression of GRHL2. Moreover, the expression of miR-194 and GRHL2 was inversely correlated in psoriasis lesional skin. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-194 inhibits the proliferation and promotes the differentiation of keratinocytes through targeting GRHL2. The downregulation of miR-194 expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of psoriasis and targeting miR-194 may represent a novel and potential therapeutic strategy for psoriasis.",

Because of its rarity, clinical and pathologic characteristics of thymic adenocarcinoma are unclear. We present nine cases of primary thymic adenocarcinoma and discuss clinicopathologic findings in the context of the existing literature.Two-hundred twenty-six thymic carcinoma cases were diagnosed at Samsung Medical Center in Korea, from January, 2001 to July, 2016. Nine of these 226 cases were primary thymic adenocarcinomas. The mean age of primary thymic adenocarcinoma patients was 53.6 years, slightly younger than the mean age of patients with thymic squamous cell carcinomas. The male to female ratio was 2:1. Symptoms, if present, were usually due to compression by the tumor. Tumors showed an extra- or intra-cellular mucin and tubular growth pattern, with CK20- and CDX2-immunoreactivity, similar to adenocarcinomas of the lower intestinal tract.Twenty-five previously reported cases, classified as mucinous adenocarcinoma and adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, also had similar characteristics to enteric-type adenocarcinoma and generally expressed CK20, CDX2, CEA, and/or MUC2. Some of these cases had a thymic cyst. These characteristics are different from those of papillary thymic carcinomas, which are morphologically similar to papillary thyroid carcinomas, express CK7 but not CK20, and are often associated with thymoma. The prognosis of thymic adenocarcinoma, enteric type appeared to be worse than the prognosis of papillary thymic carcinoma or carcinoma with adenoid cystic carcinoma-like features.In summary, we demonstrated that common primary thymic adenocarcinomas show enteric-type differentiation with mucin. This tumor type has distinct clinical, pathological, immunohistochemical and prognostic characteristics and is different from other subtypes of thymic adenocarcinoma, papillary thymic carcinoma, and carcinoma with adenoid cystic carcinoma-like features.",

Enhanced tumor RTL was associated with smoking habit, poor differentiation, advanced tumor stage, lymph node metastasis and cancer related death. In particular, a close relationship between longer RTL and poor survival was fully demonstrated by using cox regression and Kaplan-Maier survival curves.We found frequent telomere elongation in esophageal cancer tissues, and demonstrated longer RTL may be an independent poor prognostic factor for esophageal cancer patients.",

Error rate was expressed as percentage of reviewed cases where the initial diagnosis differed from the review diagnosis. Error rates detected by each method were compared among the methodsThe 10% random review detected seventeen errors in 2147 cases (0.8%). Solicited case consultations requested by clinicians or internal pathologists detected five diagnostic errors in seventy cases (7.1%). Unsolicited reviews by outside institutions in the course of patient care detected three diagnostic errors in 190 cases (1.6%). Review of the dermatopathology material disclosed 5 diagnostic errors in 59 cases (8.5%).Focused reviews initiated by diagnostic concerns of a clinician or pathologist, unsolicited reviews because of treatment at another institution and sub-specialty based reviews appear to be more effective in detecting diagnostic errors than the 10% random review.

The series comprised 3 males and 1 female, aged 27\u201376 years (median 64 years). All tumors arose in the nasal cavity. Three neoplasms were diagnosed in advanced stage pT4. During the follow-up period (range 14\u2013111 months (median 72 months)), three tumors recurred locally, but none of the patients developed regional or distant metastases. Ultimately, two patients died due to the tumor.Microscopically, all tumors consisted of infiltrating nests of polygonal basaloid cells with a variable component of rhabdoid cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm. Immunohistochemically, there was almost diffuse expression of cytokeratins (CK), p16, p40 and p63 in all cases, while expression of CK5/6, CK7 and vimentin was only focal or absent. The detection of NUT gave negative results. In three cases, the absence of SMARCB1/INI1 expression was due to deletion of SMARCB1/INI1 gene. Methylation of SMARCB1/INI1 gene was not found. One tumor harbored HPV18 E6/E7 mRNA.All 12 genes (BRAF, BRCA1, BRCA2, KIT, EGFR, KRAS, NRAS, PDGFRA, PIK3CA, PTEN, RET, and ROS1) tested for mutations using NGS were wild-type. Regarding DNA methylation, all four SMARCB1/INI1-deficient tumors showed methylation of RASSF1 gene by means of MS-MLPA. There was a statistically significant difference in RASSF1 gene methylation between SMARCB1/INI1-deficient and SMARCB1/INI1-positive tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0095).

Atypical presentations were observed in 5 cases and included ulcerative lesion, indurated mass and a gangrenous mass. Histological assessment revealed two patterns of inflammatory reactions described as classic (dermal) form (38.5%) and deep (subcutaneous) form (61.5%). Laboratory investigations showed leukocytosis in 61.5%, neutropenia in 38.5%, anaemia in 92.3%, and thrombocytopenia in 84.6%.

Despite radical nephrectomy, the patient experienced an early local retroperitoneal recurrence associated with lung and liver metastases. The tumor did not respond to four successive lines of chemotherapy nor to palliative radiotherapy. Due to partial morphologic and immunohistochemical overlap with Ewing sarcoma, CIC-DUX4 positive tumors have generally been considered as Ewing-like sarcomas and managed similarly. However, this tumor shows a high propensity to metastasize and is much less sensitive to chemotherapy than Ewing sarcomas. The management of this type of very aggressive sarcoma needs to be defined by comprehensive biological and clinical studies.",

Melanoma presenting as a pleural effusion is very rare in adults and not reported in the pediatric population. Additionally, primary pulmonary melanoma is overall very rare and undocumented in pediatric patients. Furthermore, the distinction between a primary pulmonary/pleural melanoma versus a regressed cutaneous melanoma with pulmonary/pleural metastases remains extremely challenging. We discuss a case of a previously healthy 13-year-old girl that presented with a left-sided pleural effusion. Investigations revealed a large mediastinal mass, left-sided pleural and pulmonary nodules, a sacral mass, and bone marrow infiltration. The neoplasm was subsequently diagnosed by morphology and immunocytochemistry with histological correlation as malignant melanoma. As no mucosal, eye, or cutaneous lesions were identified, we deliberate the likelihood of a regressed cutaneous melanoma with metastases versus primary pulmonary/pleural melanoma with pleural effusion and discuss its diagnostic approach.",

     "abstract": "A sort of PRCC with distinct eosinophilic cytoplasm named Oncocytic Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma (OPRCC) has been increasingly attracting the attention of researchers recently. However, owing to the rarity of OPRCC, the clinicopathological and genetic features of the tumor have still not been well elucidated and whether it should be regarded as an independent subtype of PRCC remains controversial. Herein, a cohort of 14 OPRCCs was studied with the aim of revealing the distinct clinicopathological features, facilitating the classification and correct diagnosis of OPRCC. Men and women each accounted for a half of the cohort with the median age of 64 years old. The majority of patients (9/14) were identified by medical examination and the remaining presented with macroscopic haematuria or lumbar pain. Grossly, tumors were well demarcated and varied from 1.5 to 9\u00a0cm in diameter. Microscopically, typical OPRCC possessed fine papillary structures with delicate fibrovascular cores, lined with a single layer cell with large, deeply eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and round or polygonal-shaped nucleus exhibiting low nuclear grade in 10 cases (WHO/ISUP grade I-II). Most cases (12/14) possessed hemosiderin-laden and foam-like cells. Focal necrosis presented in 5 cases. Furthermore, solid oncocytoma-like areas appeared in 5 cases and focal sarcomatoid differentiation was identified in 1 case. Immunohistochemically, the majority of tumors presented high expression rates of alpha-methylacylCoA racemase (AMACR), CD10 and vimentin, which were similar to type 2 PRCC. The immune markers including cytokeratin-7 (CK7), KSP-cadherin and EMA exhibited variable positive immunostaining. Genetically, FISH analysis demonstrated trisomy of chromosome 7 in 7 OPRCCs and trisomy of chromosome 17 in 6 OPRCCs. Among 7 male cases, loss of chromosome Y was revealed in 2 cases. Follow-up data was available in 13 patients and only 1 patient died of bone metastasis of the tumor. The other 12 patients were all alive uneventfully at a mean follow-up time of 37 months, indicating that OPRCC is a unique subtype of PRCC with indolent clinical behavior. In conclusion, OPRCCs show a single layer tumor cell of low nuclear grade similar to type 1 PRCC, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm resembling type 2 PRCC. Furthermore, the tumor presents the same immunophynotype as type 2 PRCC but the same genetic features and prognosis as type 1 PRCC. OPRCC should be classified as an independent subtype of PRCC with different features from both type 1 and type 2 PRCC.",

Polyarticular JIA has been reported as the main form of JIA in several locations. Until now, understanding of the genetic basis of JIA is incomplete. The purpose of this study was to identify pathway pairs of great potential functional relevance in the progression of polyarticular JIA.Microarray data of 59 peripheral blood samples from healthy children and 61 samples from polyarticular JIA were transformed to gene expression data. Differential expressed genes (DEG) between patients and normal controls were identified using Linear Models for Microarray Analysis. After performed enrichment of DEG, differential pathways were identified with Fisher\u2019s test and false discovery rate. Differential pathway pairs were constructed with random two differential pathways, and were evaluated by Random Forest classification. Monte Carlo Cross-Validation was introduced to screen the best pathway pair.42 DEG with P-values\u00a0<\u00a00.01 were identified. 19 differential pathways with P-values\u00a0<\u00a00.01 were identified. Area under the curve (AUC) of pathway pairs was generated with RF classification. After 50 bootstraps of Monte Carlo Cross-Validation, the best pathway pair with the highest AUC value was identified, and it was the pair of tumoricidal function of hepatic natural killer cells pathway and erythropoietin signaling pathway.These identified pathway pairs may play pivotal roles in the progress of polyarticular JIA and can be applied for diagnosis. Particular attention can be focused on them for further research.",

However, its significance in the Nigerian BC population, which is characterized by a higher rate of the triple-negative and basal phenotype, p53 mutation rate and BRCA1 deficiency, still needs to be investigated. We hypothesize that Ku70/80 expression shows adverse expression in Nigerian BC and, furthermore, that it is likely to have a therapeutic implication for Black BC management.This study investigated the biological, clinicopathological and prognostic significance of Ku 70/80 expression in a BC cohort from a Nigerian population. Ku 70/80 expression was determined in 188 well-characterized formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) BC samples using tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry. Ku 70/80 expression was correlated with clinicopathological, molecular and prognostic characteristics of patients.Ku 70/80 was expressed in 113 (60.1%) tumors, and was positively associated with metastatic disease, triple-negative and basal phenotype, BRCA1 down regulators (MTA-1 and ID4), p-cadherin, PI3KCA and p53 expression. It inversely correlated with BRCA1, BRCA2, BARD1 and p27. Ku 70/80 was predictive of breast cancer-specific survival in multivariate analysis, but not of disease-free interval.This study demonstrated that Ku 70/80 expression is associated with triple negativity and down-regulation of the homologous recombination pathway of DNA repair. Therefore, the development of novel drugs to target KU70/80 may improve the patients\u2019 outcome in the treatment of Black BC.",

On a retrospective search of the pathology database from 2001 to 2015, we identified 78 appendiceal endometriosis cases and intestinal metaplasia was present in 10/78 (13%) cases. In most of the cases (90%), the foci of intestinal metaplasia were mainly localized close to the mucosa. Intestinal and endometrial hybrid glands were present in 9/10 (90%) cases. These cases were often associated with marked appendiceal distortion, luminal obliteration and mass formation, causing concern for a mucinous neoplasm clinically and pathologically. Our findings indicate that intestinal metaplasia in appendiceal endometriosis is not an uncommon phenomenon, which can be mistaken for a mucinous neoplasm.

SMAD-4 gene is responsible for the control of many important cellular processes, for example prevention of excessive epithelial cell growth and divisions. This suppressor gene is located on chromosome 18 within the region with frequent genetic losses in colorectal cancer. Inactivation of this gene is commonly found in pancreatic cancer where the SMAD-4 gene lost in the expression has been associated with a poor prognosis in this cancer. However, the role of SMAD-4 gene in other cancers has not been completely explained, therefore in the present study we tried to find the role of this gene in colon cancer. The relative expression level of SMAD-4 gene was determined by real-time PCR for 80 cases of colorectal cancer. The obtained results for SMAD-4 expression were compared with many clinical and pathological variables (such as the size and depth of primary tumour penetration, presence of the metastases, stage of cancer, histological grade or overall survival). It was found that the level of SMAD-4 gene expression was not associated with the analyzed parameters of clinical staging. The lack of dependence can be caused by slight differences within the study group in view of parameters correlated with invasive colon cancer. Further analysis in this direction is needed.",

However, when they arise, in the acute phase of infection, several organs are affected due to the rapid spread of tachyzoites through the bloodstream. In the present study, the reduction of tachyzoites in peripheral blood of mice of G72 (infected 72\u00a0h after treatment) and G48 (infected 48\u00a0h after treatment and treated three more times), when compared with IC (infected and non-treated), suggests protective effect exerted by Lycopodium clavatum. If on the one hand L. clavatum brought benefits, reducing parasitemia, on the other hand, the parasitism became exacerbated. Histopathological analysis demonstrated focal, multifocal and diffuse inflammatory infiltrates, ranging from absent, discreet, moderate to intense, in heart and encephalon of mice of NIC (non-infected and non-treated), IC, G48 and G72 groups, respectively. In the perivascular region and meninges, the injuries were enlarged. The presence of tachyzoites was demonstrated through immunohistochemical (IHC) assay in myocardium.

The presence of inflammatory infiltrates, as well as the progressive fibrosis, caused myocardial remodeling in animals treated with L. clavatum.

Lymphatic microdensity was determined based on the number of vessels immunoreactive to anti-D2-40 antibody. The percentage of neoplastic cells exhibiting cytoplasmic staining for VEGF-C was established for each case.Assessment of intratumoral lymphatic microdensity (ILMD) disclosed a median number of 6.20 lymphatic vessels in young patients and of 6.60 in old patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.809). Analysis of peritumoral lymphatic microdensity (PLMD) revealed a median number of 3.60 lymphatic vessels in young patients and of 3.40 in old patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.769). In the tumor core, analysis of the percentage of immunopositive cells for VEGF-C revealed a median number of 95.95% in young patients and of 55.48% in old patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In the deep invasive front, the median number of immunopositive cells for VEGF-C was 97.93% in young patients and 66.09% in old patients (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).The results of this study suggest that the more aggressive biological behavior of SCC of the tongue in young patients may be related to a higher expression of VEGF-C.",

Cells in zmpste24-deficient mice show delayed DNA damage response, increased aneuploidy and increased genomic instability, which are considered features of cancer cells. The aim of this study was to address whether ZMPSTE24 gene was mutated in colorectal cancers (CRCs) and gastric (GCs), and its expression was altered. ZMPSTE24 possesses a T9 mononucleotide repeat in an exon, which could be mutated in cancers with defects in mismatch repair that can result in microsatellite instability (MSI). For this, the current study studied 124 CRCs and 79 GCs for mutation and expression analyses. For mutations in the T9, CRCs (16.4%) and GCs (8.8%) with high MSI (MSI-H), but not microsatellite stable/low MSI (MSS/MSI-L), exhibited frameshift mutations. Also, the ZMPSTE24 mutations showed intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in 4 of 16 CRC cases. Downregulation of ZMPSTE24 protein expression was found in 16.9% of CRCs and 8.9% of GCs by immunohistochemistry. Our study found frameshift mutation and its ITH in ZMPSTE24 gene as well as downregulation of ZMPSTE24 expression. Based on these observations, the present study suggests that inhibition of ZMPSTE24 by both mutational and expressional pathways might together play a role in tumorigenesis of CRC and GC harboring MSI-H phenotype.",

Matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14), as a member of the MMPs family, has been reported to play a vital role in coronary vascular lesions of allotransplanted hearts. However, concrete mechanism is still unclear. Herein, we showed that the expression of MMP-14 was different between isografts and allografts. Interestingly, we found MMP-14 could interact with CD44 in allografts. Cluster of differentiation 44 (CD44), as a cell adhesion receptor and is involved in cell migration, caused our interest in MMP-14/CD44 complex in allografts. Then we analyzed the effect of MMP-14/CD44 complex on pro-MMP-9 activation and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration in rat VSMC TNF-\u03b1 treated model. Then, we further found intervention of MMP-14/CD44 complex could inhibit VSMC migration. Our results elucidate the molecular mechanism of VSMC migration after cardiac transplantation and provide theoretical basis for seeking new specific drug targets for CAV prevention and treatment.",

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the relationship between HER2 gene heterogeneity, or so called CEP17 polysomy, using breast carcinoma cells sampled by scraping and the IHC score graded by automated image analysis using whole slide image.We randomly selected 23 breast carcinoma cases with a HER2 score 0, 24 cases with a HER2 score 1+, 24 cases with HER2 score 2+, and 23 cases with HER2 score 3+ from the records of patients with breast cancer at Hiroshima University Hospital. We compared the results of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues and cytological samples and compared the HER2 score calculated using an automated image analysis using wholly scanned slide images and visual counting.We successfully performed the FISH assay in 78 of 94 cases (83%) using FFPE tissues and in all 94 (100%) cases using cytological samples. Frequency of both HER2 amplification and CEP17 polysomy was higher when cytological samples were used than when FFPE tissue was used. Frequency of HER2 heterogeneity using cytological samples was higher that than using FFPE tissue, except for the IHC score 3+ cases.When assessment of HER2 status based on FISH using FFPE tissue cannot be accomplished, FISH using cytological samples should be considered. When intensity of HER2 is heterogeneous in the tumor tissue, particularly in cases regarded as score 2+, they should be evaluated by automated image analysis using the whole slide image.",

It has been observed that either up-regulated or down-regulated Plk1 could induce mitotic defects that results in aneuploidy and tumorigenesis, probably depending on the context. Few previous reports have associated Plk1 expression with prognosis and response to radiotherapy in rectal carcinomas. The aim of this study is to investigate the prognostic impact of Plk1 expression and its role in predicting response to neoadjuvant cheomoradiotherapy in rectal cancer.Immunohistochemical analysis of Plk1 expression was performed in the pre-treatment tumour specimens from 75 rectal cancer patients. We analysed the assocation between Plk1 expression and clinicopathological parameters, pathologic response and outcome. Opposed to previous reports on this issue, low expression of Plk1 was significantly associated with a high grade of differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.0007) and higher rate of distant metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.014). More importantly, decreased levels of Plk1 were associated with absence of response after neoadjuvant therapy (P\u00a0=\u00a00.049). Moreover, low Plk1 expression emerged as an unfavourable prognostic factor for disease-free survival in the non-responder group of patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.037).Decreased Plk1 expression was associated with poor pathologic response and worse disease-free survival in rectal cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, suggesting Plk1 as a clinically relevant marker to predict chemoradiotherapy response and outcome.",

In this study, we analyzed 6126 breast cancers diagnosed between 1998 and 2013 to identify factors associated with de novo metastatic breast cancer. When compared to patients without metastasis at presentation, race, histologic grade, estrogen/progesterone receptor (ER/PR) and HER2 statuses were significantly associated with de novo metastasis in the entire cohort, whereas age, histologic grade, PR and HER2 status were the significant parameters in the subset of patients with locally advanced breast cancer (Stage IIB/III). The patients with de novo metastatic breast cancer had a significant older mean age and a lower proportion of HER2-positive tumors when compared to those with metastatic recurrence. Further, the HER2-rich subtype demonstrated a drastically higher incidence of de novo metastasis when compared to the luminal and triple-negative breast cancers in the entire cohort [odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a05.68 and 2.27, respectively] and in the patients with locally advanced disease (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.02 and 2.12, respectively), whereas no significant difference was seen between de novo metastatic cancers and those with metastatic recurrence.

A total of 270 duodenal biopsies taken from the distal duodenum of patients with a diagnosis of CD were included in the study. All biopsies were classified according to Marsh, Oberhuber, Corazza Villanaci, and Ensari classification schemes. For statistical analyses cases were divided into three groups: Group 1 included type 1 lesions in Marsh, Ensari, and Oberhuber and grade A in Corazza Villanaci classifications. Group 2 comprised of type 2 lesions in Marsh and Ensari classifications together with type2, type 3a and 3b lesions in Oberhuber classification and grade B1 lesions in Corazza Villanaci classification. Group 3 included type 3 lesions in Marsh and Ensari classifications, and type 3c lesions in Oberhuber, and grade B2 lesions in Corazza Villanaci classifications.

Nevertheless, nodular glomerulosclerosis pattern can rarely occur in non-diabetic patients. In such cases, the differential diagnosis includes membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, light or heavy chain deposition disease, amyloidosis, fibrillary and immunotactoid glomerulonephritis and chronic hypoxic or ischemic conditions. In cases that the above entities cannot be proven, the term idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis is given.Here, we report a case of a male patient with renal failure stage IV and non-nephrotic range proteinuria. He had a history of heavy smoking and hypertension. The kidney biopsy revealed diabetic-like lesions. However, there was no evidence of glucose impairment despite the thorough work-up at the biopsy time and thereafter. The laboratory data and the electron microscopy of the specimen could not prove any other cause of nodular glomerulosclerosis, and the final diagnosis was idiopathic nodular glomerulosclerosis. Moreover, we focus on the pathological differential diagnosis and work-up.",

Here, we examined the effects of inhibition of NO overproduction on brain infarction, cerebrovascular damage and expression of claudin-5 and zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) in striatum of ischemic brain. The experiment was performed in three groups of rats; sham, control ischemia and ischemic treatment. Brain ischemia was induced by 60\u00a0min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) followed by 24\u00a0h of reperfusion. Treated rats received L-NAME 30\u00a0min before induction of ischemia (1\u00a0mg/kg, i.p.). Infarct volume and histopathological changes of ischemic striatum were assessed by TTC and LFB staining methods, respectively. Ultimately, quantitative RT-PCR was used for assessment of claudins-5 and ZO-1 expression. MCAO in the control group induced infarction (135\u00a0\u00b1\u00a025\u00a0mm3) at large areas of striatum in accompany with neuronal damages, whereas L-NAME significantly reduced infarction (87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a016\u00a0mm3) and neuronal injuries. The mRNA of ZO-1 and claudin-5 decreased in ischemic striatum, whereas inhibition of NO overproduction by L-NAME attenuated this reduction for these genes. Our findings indicated that NO overproduction after brain ischemia plays a crucial role in neuronal damage especially at striatal regions. Hence, inhibition of excessive NO production may save striatal cerebrovascular integrity of ischemic brain.",

We studied 14 TSC cases, and 4 possible TSC cases with multiple angiomyolipomas (AMLs) for hamartin and tuberin protein expression to determine if the staining profile could predict mutation status or likelihood of TSC with renal-limited disease. The 18 cases included 15 nephrectomies and 1 section of 6 TSC-associated renal cell carcinomas (RCC). Controls included the non-neoplastic kidney in 5 tumor nephrectomies, 4 sporadic cases of AML and 6 clear cell RCCs. In the 14 TSC cases, 9 had AMLs, 9 had RCCs, 5 had polycystic kidney disease and 8 had eosinophilic cysts (EC) lined by large eosinophilic cells. The controls and study cases showed luminal staining of proximal tubules (PT) and peripheral membrane staining in distal tubules/collecting ducts for hamartin and cytoplasmic staining for tuberin. Eosinophilic cysts had a luminal PT-like stain with hamartin and a cytoplasmic reaction for tuberin. Hamartin stained myoid cells in all AMLs. Tuberin was negative in all but 1AML, an epithelioid AML. All but 1 RCC were positive for tuberin; 13 RCCs (7 TSC/6 non-TSC) were negative for hamartin and 4 showed a weak reaction. We conclude that the ECs of TSC are proximal tubule-derived. The hamartin and tuberin staining profiles of AMLs and most RCCs are reciprocal precluding prediction of the mutation in TSC, and fail to predict if a patient with multifocal AML has TSC.",

We assayed matched primary and metastatic tumors from each patient with common diagnostic antibodies to Bcl-2, Cyclin D1, AMACR, and ALDH-1 by immunohistochemistry with semi-quantitative interpretation on archived formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples. We were powered for large, consistent differences between primary and metastatic expression, and found 21 of 28 had a significant difference in expression of at least one of the four proteins, accounting for multiplicity of testing. Cyclin D1 had significantly more cases with differential metastatic:primary expression than would be expected by chance alone (p-value 0.0043), favoring higher expression in the metastatic sample. Bcl-2 and ALDH-1 had trends in this direction (p-value 0.078 each). Proportionately more cases with significant differences were identified when a liver metastasis was tested.

In this article, the histological features, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay of two cases of ORTI were performed and the literatures were reviewed. Both of the patients presented to hospital with painless gross hematuria without other symptoms. One is 6 months old male, another is 5-month-old. After several diagnostic procedures, they underwent surgery and the histological diagnosis of ORTI was finally made. Grossly, the tumor had a nodular or irregular appearance, often partially calcified and located in the renal pelvis and calyces. The cut surface of this mass was grey-white, solid and firm. Histologically, the tumor was composed of three major histologic components: osteoblast-like cells, spindle cells, and an osteoid core. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that osteoblast-like cells were positive for EMA, Vimentin and STAB2. Spindle cells were strongly immunoreactive for Vimentin, WT-1 and focally positive for SMA, but were negative for CK, PAX8 and PAX2. The FISH studies with CEP4 probe on interphase nuclei from the two ORTIs, revealed trisomy 4 were 8.97% (case 1) and 12.23% (case 2).

The aim of this study was to correlate p53, MDM2, CK7, CK20, MUC1, MUC2 and CDX2 expression in ampullary adenocarcinomas with the type of differentiation and patients\u2019 survival.Forty-seven radically resected ampullary adenocarcinomas were included in this study. Thirty-eight of them were eligible for survival analysis. Patients\u2019 data were retrospectively collected. All tumors were classified as intestinal or pancreatobiliary type, according to histologic criteria, and immunohistochemically stained against the aforementioned markers.There were 18 intestinal and 29 pancreatobiliary type ampullary adenocarcinomas. A trend was found between intestinal type tumors and large tumor size. CK20, MUC2 and CDX2 expression was more prevalent in intestinal type tumors, while MUC1 was more frequently expressed in pancreatobiliary type tumors. Neither p53 nor MDM2 differential expression between the two histotypes reached statistical significance. Multivariate analysis indicated CK20 and MUC1 as independent predictors of the histotype. Mean and median survival was 90.3 and 55 months respectively. Overall 5-year survival rate was 48%. Survival analysis indicated TNM stage as the only independent prognostic factor. Although significant difference in survival rates among the two histotypes was implied based on survival plots, this difference could not gain statistical significance.Immunoreactivity against CK20 and MUC1 in ampullary carcinomas is a useful adjunct to histologic examination in determining histotype. None of the immunohistochemical markers studied has prognostic significance. Future studies focused on other signaling pathways should seek further evidence of distinct tumorigenic mechanisms between histotypes of ampullary adenocarcinoma.",

GLUT1 is a member of the mammalian facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT) family of passive carriers that functions as an energy-independent system for transporting glucose. Both of them are useful markers for the diagnosis, progression, and prognosis of various tumors, especially those that are cancerous. However, the clinical significance of MUC1 and GLUT1 in thymic epithelial tumors remains uncertain due to a lack of quality specimen and studies at sufficient scale, both owing, in part, to the rarity of the tumors. The aim of this article is to study the expression patterns of MUC1 and GLUT1 in thymic carcinoma and type B3 thymoma, and to evaluate their diagnostic value for these two types of tumors via immunohistochemistry. Forty-three patients were included in the study, including twenty-two with thymic carcinoma and twenty-one with type B3 thymoma. Tumor tissue sections were immunohistochemically stained for MUC1 and GLUT1; meanwhile, some tumors were also stained with CKpan, TDT, CD5, and CD117.

Only one case showed liver metastasis.Herein we present a series of 20 patients with 3 male and 4 pediatric cases, almost half of which were diagnosed with FNAC findings, and most of which are clinically being followed with one patient showing progression. Our series includes rare examples like collision tumor of SPN and pancreas endocrine neoplasm, SPN with multinucleated giant cells. Also cases with no surgical treatment and no progression, as well as cases with synchronous malignancies are presented. We believe that FNAC findings of any pancreatic mass should be investigated in detail for the designation of a therapy plan especially for the patients with high operation risks. The findings in our series also show that extensive necrosis, angioinvasion, perineurial invasion and larger tumor size might be predictive for worse prognosis and these patients should be more closely followed up.",

     "abstract": "Acinic cell carcinoma (ACC) is commonly thought of as a low grade malignant salivary neoplasm, and possibly has the best prognosis of all salivary malignancies with a 10-year survival of almost 90%. High grade transformation (HGT) in these tumours is a relatively rare event but is increasingly being reported. HGT (formerly referred to as dedifferentiation) in acinic cell carcinoma has shown to drastically reduce the survival rates and its recognition is imperative as more aggressive clinical management is needed. We report a case of parotid acinic cell carcinoma in a 82-year old woman where the fine needle aspirate suggested either pleomorphic adenoma or the possibility of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma. Per-operatively it became clear that the facial nerve was involved and the tumour mass was debulked only. The histology showed an acinic cell carcinoma with foci of high grade differentiation (ACC-HGT). We describe the histology of HGT in ACC and the most common differential diagnoses. We emphasise the need of very generous sampling of the tumour, as to recognise any area of high grade transformation, some of which can be very small. A literature review of ACC-HGT as well as HGT in other salivary gland neoplasms is presented. HGT of ACC greatly thus influences the macroscopical and microscopical evaluation of the specimen but also, given the high incidence of metastases and morbidity, carries significant treatment implications.",

The pathogenetic mechanism of the tumor-related heterotopic bone formation remains as yet unconfirmed. Here, we describe a rare case of LAMN with ossification in a 72-year-old woman, and concentrate on the etiology of heterotopic ossification by the immunohistochemical evaluation of the novel markers such as BMP9, osteocalcin, and osteopontin. BMP9 is one of the most effective osteogenetic proteins. However, no researches associated with BMP9 in the heterotopic ossification occurring to LAMN have been performed. Consequently, we suggest the trustworthy hypothesis of tumor-associated heterotopic bone formation through this case. When osteoblastic markers such as BMP9, osteocalcin, and osteopontin are overexpressed in tumor cells, osteoblast-like transformation of such tumor cells occurs. In turn, these tumor cells increase secretion of interactive osteogenetic factors, such as BMP9, osteocalcin, and osteopontin, thus contributing to heterotopic bone formation through a microenvironmental change to mesenchymal stromal cells (osteoblastic differentiation). This phenomenon is considered a type of EMT. Patients should be followed closely because EMT-like transformed tumors have shown a tendency toward local recurrence. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenetic etiology of the heterotopic ossification in LAMN (pseudomyxoma peritonei).",

Secondary de novo mature B-cell neoplasms arising in a patient with pre-existing CLL have been described; however, B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) developing in untreated CLL is rare, and its clonal relationship to the primary neoplasm has been an interesting issue. Herein, we report an unusual case of the sequential development of CLL and B-ALL over a 23-year period in a 64-year-old male. Examination of the peripheral blood smear and bone marrow biopsy demonstrated dual neoplastic populations: small mature lymphocytes consistent with those seen in CLL and a population of blasts that were confirmed to be B-ALL by immunophenotyping. The biclonality of these two B-cell neoplasms was supported by cytogenetic studies. While an intrinsic immunodeficiency in patients with CLL may predispose them to the development of other malignancies, the pathogenesis of this unusual phenomenon remains to be further investigated.",

Moreover, their prognostic value was further evaluated.Compared with non-cancerous bone tissues, HIF-2\u03b1 mRNA and HIF2PUT expression were both significantly upregulated in osteosarcoma tissues (all P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Practical guidelines for pathologists are provided in publications and textbooks but it is unclear how these recommendations are applied in routine practice. We investigated the characteristics of pathology reports, and the extent to which they meet guideline standards. We reviewed 819 pathology reports relating to a first diagnosis of malignant pleural mesothelioma. Data sources were a regional section of the Italian network of the Mesothelioma Registry (2001\u20132014) and a pathology archive (1990\u20132000). We evaluated tumor characteristics, the diagnosis field including terminology and immunohistochemistry (IHC) workup, and report completeness (the proportion of items recorded). We investigated also two IHC panels identified by the most used markers in current practical guidelines, one best suited for epithelioid mesotheliomas (combinations of at least 2 positive and at least 2 negative mesothelioma markers) and the other best suited for sarcomatoid mesotheliomas (positive mesothelioma markers plus cytokeratins). Reports (753 histology, 66 cytology, IHC-confirmed 86%) were 74% complete and always narrative. Missing data were related to clinical history (76%), tumor laterality (61%), specimen size (38%), and histological subtype (23%). The proportion of cases with IHC was higher for epithelioid (90%) than sarcomatoid mesothelioma (87%). Compliance to IHC recommendations was higher for epithelioid (59%) than sarcomatoid mesothelioma (11%). The mean number of stains was significantly higher for sarcomatoid than epithelioid mesothelioma (p\u00a0<\u00a00.000; Kruskal-Wallis test). Our findings show that although guidelines are designed to improve actual reporting practices, there is ample room for improvement in their application to standardize the diagnosis of mesothelioma.

The multivariate analysis revealed that a Ki-67 index \u226412% (HR, 0.22; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0009) and the absence of metastases (M0) during diagnosis (HR, 0.17; p\u00a0=\u00a00.0002) were protective factors in this population. In conclusion, Ki-67 proliferation index and the lack of metastases at diagnosis predict CSS in patients with advanced prostate cancer who undergo hormonal blockade. Neuroendocrine differentiation in tumour tissue had no prognostic value in this study.",

     "abstract": "p53, widely known as a tumor-suppressing gene, has recently been reported to regulate glucose metabolism in human cancers through the synthesis of cytochrome c oxidase 2 (SCO2), cytochrome c oxidase complex (COX), and TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR). In this study, we investigated the interrelations of the aforementioned proteins, particularly in human gastric cancer, with cancer progression, other clinicopathological parameters, and patient outcomes.One hundred and ten cases of primary gastric cancer occurring from June 2006 to June 2009 were investigated and classified into two groups according to the intensity of immunohistochemical staining for p53, SCO2, COX, and TIGAR. The clinicopathological data were organized and analyzed based on electronic medical records.In accordance with previous reports, the expression of p53 showed an inverse correlation with the expression of TIGAR (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032) in gastric cancer cells. However, the expression of SCO2 and COX were not shown to be associated with the regulatory role of p53, unlike TIGAR expression. Nevertheless, a significantly high recurrence rate was found in a patient group with high COX expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012).This study demonstrated that a high p53 expression could be associated with the promotion of glycolysis in gastric cancer via the modulation of TIGAR expression. In addition, a high COX expression appeared to be interrelated with poor prognosis of gastric cancer. However, further studies regarding the underlying molecular interactions are required to provide more evidence to propose a novel mechanism that explains our findings in gastric cancer.",

Its evaluation is made in most laboratories by immunohistochemistry, and interpreted by a pathologist using an optical microscope, a process subject to inter-observer variability, particularly for samples scored as equivocal (2+). Software analysis products have been introduced, seeking to reduce this variability. In this study, we compared the results of both traditional evaluation and a specific software package (VISIA Imaging) to those from fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).We selected 176 cases of invasive breast cancer sampled during 2012\u20132014 that were classified as equivocal after evaluation of Her2 immunohistochemistry, and that were also evaluated by FISH. Each tissue slide was scanned with a digital D-Sight Fluo 2.0 microscope and analysed with VISIA Imaging S.r.l. software. The final results were categorised as follows: negative (0\u20131+), equivocal (2+), or positive (3+). Then each result was compared to that obtained by FISH.The digital method confirmed 85 samples (48.3%) as equivocal (2+), while 23 (15.1%) were reclassified as negative (1+) and 44 (28.9%) as positive (3+). Of the 176 cases, 24 (13.6%) were not suitable for digital analysis (inadequate). Of 67 reclassified cases (1+ or 3+), 62 were in agreement with FISH results (concordance rate 92.5%). The sensitivity and specificity of the digital method were 100% and 82%, respectively.The application of this analysis software led to an improvement in the interpretation of cases classified as equivocal, decreasing the need for FISH and increasing diagnostic certainty.",

The patients underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy and lymph node dissection due to gastric cancer. Many subepithelial histiocyte aggregates or small foreign body granulomas, which contained gray or brown pigments or crystal-like structures, were mostly present in non-neoplastic areas of the upper GI. Lanthanum accumulation was noted in the duodenal mucosa and the antral and body mucosae of the gastric lesser curvature. Lanthanum was also deposited in the regional lymph nodes of the three patients.

     "abstract": "Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have been widely used for visualizing the inside of the human body. However, in many cases, pathological diagnosis is conducted through a biopsy or resection of an organ to evaluate the condition of tissues as definitive diagnosis. To provide more advanced information onto CT or MR image, it is necessary to reveal the relationship between tissue information and image signals. We propose a registration scheme for a set of PT images of divided specimens and a 3D-MR image by reference to an optical macro image (OM image) captured by an optical camera. We conducted a fundamental study using a resected human brain after the death of a brain cancer patient. We constructed two kinds of registration processes using the OM image as the base for both registrations to make conversion parameters between the PT and MR images. The aligned PT images had shapes similar to the OM image. On the other hand, the extracted cross-sectional MR image was similar to the OM image. From these resultant conversion parameters, the corresponding region on the PT image could be searched and displayed when an arbitrary pixel on the MR image was selected. The relationship between the PT and MR images of the whole brain can be analyzed using the proposed method. We confirmed that same regions between the PT and MR images could be searched and displayed using resultant information obtained by the proposed method. In terms of the accuracy of proposed method, the TREs were 0.56\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.39\u00a0mm and 0.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\u00a0mm.

The TFE3 gene is located at Xp11 and can fuse to a number of translocation partners, resulting in high nuclear expression of TFE3 protein. TFE3 immunostaining is often used as a surrogate marker for a TFE3 translocation. We report a case of an RCC that expressed TFE3 but showed only gain of TFE3 rather than a translocation. Moreover, this case had a t(1;2) translocation fusing ALK and TMP3, identical to that seen in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour. There was resulting overexpression of ALK protein in a cytoplasmic and membranous pattern. The patient was not treated with chemotherapy but following regional nodal recurrence, an ALK inhibitor was added and the patient remains alive one year later. There are only rare reports of RCC with an ALK-TMP3 fusion, and these tumours can express TFE3 on some unknown basis not related to a TFE3 translocation. Any RCC positive for TFE3 and lacking a translocation should be tested for ALK expression and translocation. Recognition of this subtype of RCC will allow ALK inhibitor therapy to be added, in the hope of improving patient outcome.",

Vanillin exerted anticancer effects comparable to DOX and synergesticlly potentiated DOX anticancer effects both in-vivo and in-vitro. The anticancer potency of vanillin in-vivo was mediated via apoptosis and antioxidant capacity. It also offered an in-vitro growth inhibitory effect and cytotoxicity mediated by apoptosis (increased caspase-9 and Bax:Bcl-2 ratio) along with anti-metasasis effect.

Adenomyosis is common in such failure cases. Ablations using a resectoscope will produce an Endo-Myometrial Resection (EMR) specimen. The value of histopathologic examination of EMRs in predicting treatment failure and adenomyosis has not been addressed. We retrieved histologic material from subjects with failed ablation (persistent symptoms requiring hysterectomy) and subjects with ablation followed by clinical improvement and no hysterectomy (control group). Material was evaluated for features of an abnormal endometrial distribution suggestive of adenomyosis: myometrial fragments with endometrium on opposite edges, myometrium with endometrium in \u22653 edges and areas of endometrium completely surrounded by myometrium (endometrial islands). Hysterectomy specimens from the study group were evaluated for the presence of adenomyosis and its distribution (superficial/deep). Both study and control groups consisted of 18 patients each. The number of fragments with endometrium on opposite sides was significantly higher in the study group: 2.11 vs 0.94 in the control group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Conversely, maximum aggregate dimension (2.3\u00a0cm vs 2.79\u00a0cm), number of fragments with endometrium on three sides (4.5 vs 2.78) and number of fragments with endometrial islands (4.5 vs 4.11) did not significantly differ between groups. Adenomyosis was seen in 72.2% hysterectomies from the study group; 27.8% involved deep myometrium. None of the EMR features were statistically associated with adenomyosis. Certain endomyometrial distribution patterns in EMR specimens correlate with future ablation failure and need for definitive surgery. This may be explained by residual endometrial tissue not resected due to a markedly irregular endomyometrial interface. Adenomyosis is frequent in cases of ablation failure. However, a significant association between EMR patterns studied and adenomyosis was not observed.",

Given the large number of cases of dogs affected with mammary tumors, the complexity of these tumors and their similarity with breast cancer in women, this study aimed to validate a low-cost modified method to construct TMAs for canine mammary tumor analysis using immunomarkers. Carcinoma cases were selected from canine mammary carcinomas in mixed tumors (CMT) because this tumor type is the most heterogeneous among the histopathological types of mammary tumors observed in female dogs. Through a histopathological examination, tumor representativity was compared between conventional sections and histological sections obtained from the TMA block; both were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. An immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to compare the percentages of immunoreactive cells obtained in whole tissue sections versus those obtained from sections from the TMA block. Streptavidin-biotin peroxidase complex and anti-PCNA, anti-vimentin and anti-pancytokeratin antibodies were used. Statistical analysis consisted of the nonparametric Friedman\u2019s test (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.05) and descriptive statistical analysis. Histopathological analysis showed tumor representativity in all TMA cores selected for the study. There was no difference between the immunohistochemical analysis of mammary tumors using conventional histological sections or sections obtained from a single 1-mm-diameter TMA core, regardless of the marker used: PCNA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.279), pancytokeratin (p\u00a0=\u00a00.243) and vimentin (p\u00a0=\u00a00.967).

An increased incidence of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) and atypical glandular cells not otherwise specified (AGC NOS) Pap diagnoses (12.7% and 6.1%, respectively) was found in women with benign polyps on biopsy.We demonstrated a higher rate of clinically significant histologic findings in cervical polyps (14 of 369 cases, 3.7%) compared to previously reported studies. The increase in ASCUS and AGC Pap results was most likely related to reactive and inflammatory changes present in benign polyps. Our results suggest that removal of all cervical polyps with subsequent histologic review is warranted.",

The present study was performed to assess the high risk HPV viral load of cervical cancer patients who underwent radiotherapy alone or in combination with chemotherapy or hyperthermotherapy or both in correlation to long-term survival.116 cervical cancer patients were recruited and assigned into four groups of different therapeutic modalities. The prevalent high risk types of HPV 16, 18, 58 were detected by type specific in situ hybridization (ISH), and HPV mRNA was detected by RNA scope assay using RNA scope 2.0 FFPE Reagent Kit. Semi-quantification of the HR-HPV viral load was measured based on the intensity of ISH signal captured from the tumor nests in the grey scale.The HR-HPV viral load had a significant negative correlation with survival (rs\u00a0=\u00a0\u22120.368, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). The 15-year survival rate of low viral load group was 68.18%, moderate viral load group was 52.17%, and high viral load group was 34.69% (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). HPV mRNA expression was strongly consistent with HPV viral load. The 15-year survival rates of different therapeutic groups were 39.29%, 58.62%, 50.00%, 55.17%, respectively (P\u00a0=\u00a00.545). Combinatorial treatment modalities improved the actual survival, which demonstrated no significant difference among 5, 10 and 15 years comparison. Cox regression analysis showed that the relative risk of death was obviously higher in the HPV 18 single positive group and high HPV viral load group.The semi-quantitive viral load assessment in situ is a feasible approach in clinical practice. The more the HPV viral load was, the worse the survival of patients would be. The combinational treatments were in favor of the disease-stabilization.",

Although apparently being a valuable diagnostic marker for differentiating between small cell osteosarcoma (SCO) and other small round cell tumors of bone, for instance Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT), it has not been tested in a large series of ESFT and chondrosarcomas so far. We studied the immunohistochemical expression of SATB2 in 42 osteosarcomas, 31 chondrosarcomas, and 371 genetically confirmed ESFT. SATB2 positivity was detected in 90.4% of osteosarcomas, 87.5% of SCO, 91.3% of osteoblastic osteosarcomas, and in all chondroblastic and parosteal osteosarcomas. The osteoblastic and SCO subtypes expressed SATB2 more intensely than other histological types. SATB2 was expressed in 46.6% of chondrosarcomas, and in 1.3% of ESFT. Sensitivity and specificity of SATB2 immunoexpression were 90.4% and 95.3%, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values in osteosarcoma diagnosis were 66.6% and 98.9%, respectively.In chondrosarcoma, SATB2 immunoexpression was more frequent and intense in high-grade chondrosarcoma (Grade III) and uncommon in chondrosarcoma grade I. SATB2 positivity was detected in 55.6% of chondrosarcomas grade II. SATB2 apparently cannot distinguish between chondroblastic osteosarcoma and high-grade chondrosarcoma. Nevertheless, SATB2 is frequently expressed in osteogenic tumors, but is rarely positive in ESFT, and with the support of CD99 expression and specific molecular studies, it is very useful for distinguishing between these two lesions. Although SATB2 immunoexpression helps to distinguish osteosarcoma from their mimickers, the identification of malignant osteoid matrix formation and the integration of clinical and radiological data remain the corner stone of osteosarcoma diagnosis and as yet no antibody has equalled the diagnostic value of this important morphologic hallmark.",

The clinical manifestations varied and were dependent on the lesion location. Immunohistochemistry and special staining showed that the positive rates for myeloperoxidase, CD43, CD34, CD117, CD68, Lysozyme, CD99, and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate esterase were 92.1% (35/38), 91.3% (21/23), 44.8% (13/29), 42.3% (11/26), 61.1% (11/18), 100.0% (5/5), 78.6% (11/14), and 55.6% (10/18), respectively. Histologically, the cells were predominantly arranged diffusely, and the solitary infiltrating cells may show an acinus-like arrangement, while some cells were arranged in linear or \u201cIndian file\u201d pattern. Obvious small nucleoli were seen in most cases. The nuclei were predominantly round or oval, although eccentric, kidney-shaped, and lobulated nuclei were also observed. A varied number of eosinophilic granulocytes were found in most cases. The \u201cstarry sky\u201d appearance was observed in a few patients. Among 18 patients, the survival rate was 38.9% and the median survival time was 28 months. MS occurred following allogeneic stem cell transplantation in 5 cases. There were 14 de-novo (45.2%,14/31) and 17 secondary MS (54.8%, 17/31). As for de-novo MS, female rates was higher (64.3% vs. 29.4%), older average years (41.4 vs. 31.1 years), older middle years (47.5 vs.32 years).The combined application of morphology, immunohistochemistry, and special staining may facilitate the diagnosis of this malignancy.

The response to therapy is variable and may be affected by the presence, within the tumor, of a proportion of cancer stem cells, implicated in chemo- and radioresistance. The expression of the stem cell markers nestin and CD44 in GBs has been extensively investigated.The aim of our study was to compare the immunohistochemical expression of nestin and CD44 in 25 cases of GBs and evaluate their possible prognostic value in relation to overall survival time.We found that their expression was strongly correlated (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0090\u00a0e r\u00a0=\u00a00.5320) and this finding was confirmed by observation with double staining techniques.

We report a case of urinary bladder cancer with small cell carcinoma as a predominant component, accompanied by sarcomatoid carcinoma and conventional urothelial carcinoma (UC). Although the small cell carcinoma component had resolved on receiving chemoradiotherapy, rapid growth of the residual tumor led to a fatal outcome. A 47-year-old man presented with occasional bladder irritation and had a 2-year history of asymptomatic hematuria. Cystoscopy revealed a huge mass in the urinary bladder, and transurethral resection was performed. Microscopically, small cell carcinoma was detected as the major tumor component. Spindle-shaped sarcomatoid cells were also observed that were intermingled with small cell carcinoma and conventional UC. In addition, a sheet-like growth of the lipoblast-like neoplastic cells was observed focally. Initially, by providing chemoradiotherapy, we achieved a marked tumor regression; however, the tumor rapidly regrew after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, and the patient underwent radical cystectomy. Only conventional UC and sarcomatoid carcinoma were identified in the cystectomy specimen. The patient died of the disease 4 months after cystectomy. Urinary bladder cancer may include a combination of multiple aggressive histologies as in the present case.

Histological examination and immunohistochemical studies in the explanted liver revealed prominent foamy histiocytes that were CD68 positive, but CD1a and S100 negative. Mutational hotspot analysis of the explanted liver using a panel of 47 most common cancer-related genes performed by next generation sequencing (NGS) revealed likely somatic mutations in the PDGFRA, PTEN, and HNF1A genes, but no BRAF codon 600 mutations were detected.

Concerning oncogenes and signaling transduction pathways mediated by them, identification of specific gene alterations remains a critical process for handling patients by applying targeted therapeutic regimens. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in normal cells. EGFR mutations and amplification represent the gene\u2019s main deregulation mechanisms in cancers of different histo-genetic origin. Furthermore, intra-cancer molecular heterogeneity due to clonal rise and expansion mainly explains the variable resistance to novel anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb), and also tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). According to recently published 2015 WHO new classification, lung cancer is the leading cause of death related to cancer and its incidence is still on the increase worldwide. The majority of patients suffering from lung cancer are diagnosed with epithelial tumors (adenocarcinoma predominantly and squamous cell carcinoma represent \u223c85% of all pathologically defined lung cancer cases). In those patients, EGFR-activating somatic mutations in exons 18/19/20/21 modify patients\u2019 sensitivity (i.e. exon 21 L858R, exon 19 LREA deletion) or resistance (ie exon 20 T790\u00a0M and/or insertion) to TKI mediated targeted therapeutic strategies.

In addition, the effects of SHD on the expression of Aurora A and p53 were determined by RT-PCR and western blot. Besides, we used Aurora A siRNA to knock down Aurora A. We then co-administrated SHD and tamoxifen or epirubicin to detect the effect of SHD on chemosensitivity to tamoxifen or epirubicin. SHD treatment significantly inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, SHD treatment resulted in a marked decrease in Aurora A expression and obvious increase in p53 expression. In addition, knockdown of Aurora A induced cell growth inhibition, which was similar to the effect of SHD treatment. Besides, SHD exerted an additive effect on cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induction when breast cancer cells were co-administration of SHD with tamoxifen or epirubicin.

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance and concordance rate of c-MET immunohistochemistry (IHC) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) through meta-analysis and diagnostic test accuracy review.The current study included 4454 NSCLC cases of 22 eligible studies. The meta-analysis examined the correlation between c-MET IHC expression and clinicopathological parameters. We investigated concordance rate between c-MET IHC and genetic alteration and performed subgroup analysis based on c-MET IHC cut-off value.The estimated positive rate of c-MET IHC was 0.440 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.355\u20130.529). The positive rate of c-MET IHC was significantly high in non-squamous cell carcinomas and tumors with stage III\u2013IV. However, there was no significant difference between c-MET IHC positivity and sex, smoking, and lymph node metastasis. The c-MET IHC positivity was significantly correlated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio 1.551, 95% CI 1.101\u20132.184). In c-MET IHC-positive and negative groups, the concordance rate was 0.941 (95% CI 0.885\u20130.971) and 0.300 (95% CI 0.196\u20130.429), respectively. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the high cut-off subgroup for c-MET IHC was 1.00 (95% CI 0.92\u20131.00) and 0.78 (95% CI 0.75\u20130.81), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio and the area under curve on summary receiver operating characteristic curve were 76.56 (95% CI 8.23\u2013712.41) and 0.9949, respectively.The c-MET IHC could be useful for screening of c-MET genetic alteration in NSCLC patients. Detailed criteria for c-MET IHC evaluation are necessary to determine how to best apply this approach in daily practice.",

The abnormal expression of PCBP2 was correlated with various carcinomas. However, the significance and mechanism of PCBP2 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) progression remain unclear. In this study, Western Blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis revealed that PCBP2 was overexpressed in ESCC tissues and cell lines. Statistical results also indicated that PCBP2 expression level was significantly positively correlated with ESCC clinicopathological parameters such as tumor grade and tumor size. Furthermore, PCBP2 expression level could also be recognized as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients\u2019 overall survival. Serum starvation and refeeding assay along with PCBP2-shRNA transfection demonstrated that PCBP2 expression promoted proliferation of ESCC cells. The results above are partly due to growth arrest of cell cycle at G1/S phase. We also found that reduced PCBP2 expression might induce ESCC cell apoptosis with increased cleaved caspase3 expression. Overall, our findings indicated that PCBP2 might be involved in the ESCC progression and be considered as a new treatment target in ESCC.",

Molecular analysis has shown in different cancers that variation in clinical behavior can be associated with specific alterations.

However, stratified analysis according to treatment arm revealed that the effect of deregulated p53 expression and high Ki67 expression was restricted to the disease free survival of patients treated with adjuvant gemcitabine. In multivariable survival analysis, p53 did not retain its prognostic status.Our study supports the important role of p53 and Ki67 expression in PDAC. They provide prognostic information in patients with adjuvant gemcitabine treatment and may contribute to treatment decision. However, these results should be validated in further studies.",

Different slide-based assays are available for assessment of treatment eligibility, which include fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or other in situ hybridization (ISH) methods for assessment of the HER2 gene status. Here we report a summary of the validation data on HER2 IQFISH pharmDx\u2122 (Dako Omnis), a newly developed assay for the automated staining platform Dako Omnis. The assay uses a non-toxic buffer that significantly reduces the hybridization time, which results in a total turnaround time of 3\u00bd to 4\u00a0h from deparaffinization to counting of the gene and centromere signals. The data reported in the current summary covers method comparison, assessment of staining quality, observer-to-observer reproducibility as well as reproducibility within and between laboratories. Based on data from the different studies it was concluded that HER2 IQFISH pharmDx (Dako Omnis) is a reliable and robust assay with a high precision that is at least comparable to the manual HER2 IQFISH pharmDx\u2122 assay and the PathVysion\u00aeHER-2 DNA Probe Kit.",

We describe the case of a 38-year-old male who presented with complaints of anorexia, weight loss, and abdominal pain. CT abdomen showed a mass in the head of the pancreas, multiple small nodules in the body of pancreas, and bilateral adrenal masses. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) from the mass showed features of a neuroendocrine tumor, with many of the cells demonstrating abundant clear cytoplasm. Histopathological examination of the pancreaticoduodenectomy specimen showed a mixed serous neuroendocrine neoplasm with two components viz. serous cystadenoma and neuroendocrine tumor (NET) World Health Organization (WHO) grade 2. In addition, he was diagnosed to have bilateral pheochromocytomas and a paraganglioma. The synchronicity of these tumors suggested the possibility of VHL disease. Thus, identification of a NET with clear cells or of a mixed serous neuroendocrine neoplasm should raise suspicion of VHL disease. In a mixed tumor, FNAC may identify only one of the two components. Thorough processing of all pancreatic serous tumors for pathological examination is recommended, as NET may occur as a small nodule within the serous cystadenoma.",

This review provides a comprehensive description of ILBC characteristics, including epidemiology, clinical features, molecular genetics and histomorphology. Twenty detailed supplemental data tables guide through primary data of more than 200 original studies. Meta-analyses indicate that ILBC is at least twice as common in the Western world as it is in other geographic regions. ILBC is over-represented in so\u2010called interval carcinomas and in primary metastatic breast cancer. ILBC is also associated higher age, higher pT stage and hormone receptor (ER/PR) positivity. Pathological complete response rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy are low, ranging between 0% and 11%. Positive resection margins after breast-conserving surgery are comparatively frequent and 17% to 65% of patients undergo a second surgical intervention. Depending on the morphological stringency in the diagnosis of ILBC, lack of E\u2010cadherin expression is observed in 55% to 100% of cases. CDH1/E-cadherin mutation detection rates vary between 12% and 83%. Various additional molecular factors, including PIK3CA, TP53, FOXA1, FGFR1, ZNF703 and BCAR4, have been implicated in ILBC or progression of lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) to invasive cancer and are discussed in detail. Eight instructive figure plates recapitulate the histomorphology of ILBC and its variants. Furthermore, we draw attention to rarely addressed histological details, such as two\u2010sided nuclear compression and fat\u2010avoiding growth at the invasion front.

Regions of interest of KRAS exon 2 were amplified and visualized on 2% agarose gel. Obtained PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing. KRAS mutations were detected in 35% of patients, 91% of which were located in codon 12 and 9% in codon 13. In general, KRAS mutation status did not affect the response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT). However, patients harboring mutated KRAS gene, simultaneously with high vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression, exhibited a worse response to CRT (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030), a more frequent appearance of local recurrences and distant metastasis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003), and shorter overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) compared to all others. On the contrary, patients with GGT>GCT KRAS mutation exhibited a significantly better response to CRT than those with any other type of KRAS mutation (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017). Moreover, the presence of GGT>GCT mutation was associated with low VEGF and Ki67 expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012 in both cases), parameters related to less aggressiveness of the disease. Our results suggest that KRAS mutation status could have some predictive and prognostic importance in rectal cancer when analyzed together with other parameters, such as VEGF and Ki67 expression. In addition, it seems that not only the presence but the type of KRAS mutation is important for examining its impact on CRT response.",

In the breast, PEH has been documented but is rare. PEH is notorious for being misdiagnosed as angiosarcoma due to its complex growth pattern, papillary processes and interlacing vascular channels. The occurrence of PEH years after breast irradiation constitutes a pathological and clinical diagnostic challenge because angiosarcoma is far more common in this setting. The most important features that differentiate papillary endothelial hyperplasia from angiosarcoma are its presentation as a round nodule without infiltrative borders, its localization inside a vessel or in association with thrombus, and the lack of significant cytologic atypia or areas of solid growth, even in the presence of a complex architecture. Clinical history and site of involvement (cutaneous versus parenchymal) are usually of help to establish a correct diagnosis. Herein, we describe two cases of PEH presenting in patients with history of breast carcinoma and breast radiation therapy. The clinical and morphological features as well as the differential diagnoses are discussed. To our knowledge, no other cases of PEH of the breast occurring in the post-radiation setting have been described in the literature.",

Despite having metastasizing capacities, they usually show less aggressive progression compared to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of other organs. Metastasis suppressor proteins (MSPs) are a group of proteins that control and slow-down the metastatic process. In this study, we established the importance of seven well-defined MSPs including NDRG1, NM23-H1, RhoGDI2, E-cadherin, CD82/KAI1, MKK4, and AKAP12 in cSCCs.Protein expression levels of the selected MSPs were detected in 32 cSCCs, 6 in situ SCCs, and two skin cell lines (HaCaT, A-431) by immunohistochemistry. The results were evaluated semi-quantitatively using the HSCORE system. In addition, mRNA expression levels were detected by qRT-PCR in the cell lines.The HSCOREs of NM23-H1 were similar in cSCCs and normal skin tissues, while RGHOGDI2, E-cadherin and AKAP12 were significantly downregulated in cSCCs compared to normal skin. The levels of MKK4, NDRG1 and CD82 were partially conserved in cSCCs. In stage I SCCs, nuclear staining of NM23-H1 (NM23-H1nuc) was significantly lower than in stage II/III SCCs. Only nuclear staining of MKK4 (MKK4nuc) showed significantly higher scores in in situ carcinomas compared to invasive SCCs.In conclusion, similar to other human tumors, we have demonstrated complex differential expression patterns for the MSPs in in-situ and invasive cSCCs. This complex MSP signature warrants further biological and experimental pathway research.",

Immunohistochemical expression of DBC1 were evaluated by tissue microarray.High DBC1 immunoreactivity was observed in 177 (88.9%) of the 199HCC cases and was significantly associated with younger age (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), higher \u03b1-fetoprotein level (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008), hepatitis B virus infection (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), and liver cirrhosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that post-transcriptionally regulate gene expression. Our previous study has identified miR-139-5p as a potential tumor suppressor in CRC, but its role in chemoresistance of CRC has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-139-5p was down-regulated either in CRC tumors receiving chemotherapy or in 5-FU-resistant CRC cell lines (HCT-8/5-FU and HCT-116/5-FU). Ectopic expression of miR-139-5p sensitized CRC cells to 5-FU by increasing 5-FU-induced apoptosis. In addition, miR-139-5p inhibited the expression of the miR-139-5p target gene NOTCH-1 and its downstream molecules MRP-1 and BCL-2, two key MDR-associated genes. Furthermore, silencing NOTCH-1 expression promoted the chemotherapeutic effects of 5-FU, and up-regulation of NOTCH-1 abrogated miR-139-5p-mediated sensitization to 5-FU in LoVo and HCT-116 cells. Taken together, our data indicate a new role of miR-139-5p/NOTCH-1 pathway in the drug resistance of CRC cells to 5-FU, which may be a promising therapeutic target for the anti-MDR treatment of CRC.",

We report the case of a 50 year old woman with atypical anti-MPO AAV associated with cocaine use and exposure to levamisole. In addition to the clinical and pathologic findings of crescentic GN, the patient also had biopsy evidence of secondary membranous nephropathy (MN). Although AAV and MN have been reported previously in the same patient and both have been induced by drug exposures, this is the first report of MN in a patient with AAV likely induced by levamisole. We suggest that MPO can cause both pauci-immune vasculitis and secondary membranous nephropathy in some cases, as in cases of levamisole-adulterated cocaine use.",

     "abstract": "A 41-year-old female smoker presented with a vaginal mass. Gynecological examination showed a mass filling the uterine corpus, cervix, and vagina. A total abdominal hysterectomy was performed. Macroscopic findings included a large fragile mass involving the uterine cavity, cervix, and vagina. Histology revealed atypical ducts admixed with solid components consisting of large atypical cells. The initial pathological diagnosis was grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. The patient was designated as stage II according to the 2008 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging. Two years later, two nodules were found in the upper lobe of the left lung, and the patient underwent an upper lobectomy. The masses, which exhibited solid and organoid growth patterns of large atypical cells, had histological characteristics of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) of the lung. However, the tumor was immunohistochemically positive for neuroendocrine markers, such as synaptophysin in addition to estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, and the tumor was negative for thyroid transcription factor-1. These immunohistochemical results were almost identical to those of the solid portions of the uterine carcinoma. The final diagnosis was LCNEC combined with endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus and lung metastasis of the LCNEC component of the endometrial carcinoma. LCNEC often arises in the lung, but it rarely arises in other organs. Some patients with metastatic components exhibited only a LCNEC pattern although the primary tumor was a mixed carcinoma consisting of LCNEC and other histology, like the present case. LCNEC is often poorly differentiated, especially in extrapulmonary primary organ LCNEC. Therefore, pathologists should consider metastatic carcinoma when they encounter lung LCNEC in a patient with a preceding extrapulmonary carcinoma composed of a poorly differentiated component or LCNEC component, and they should clarify tumor immunohistochemical characteristics to confirm the diagnosis.",

We present a case of a SS with a poorly differentiated component that resembles Ewing sarcoma (ES). Initial immunohistochemical staining revealed a characteristic and strong expression of transducin-like enhancer of split 1 (TLE1) and weak to absent expression of integrase integrator 1 (INI1) staining. Stainings for keratin and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) were negative in the tumoral lesion. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) analysis showed a rearrangement of the synaptotagmin (SYT) gene, confirming the diagnosis of SS.FISH analysis for the EWS RNA-binding protein 1 (EWSR1) gene revealed monoallelic loss of EWSR1. This finding was confirmed by an array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), showing complete loss of chromosome 22.Based on literature review, showing only a handful of cases of cytogenetically studied SS with loss of chromosome 22, this is probably a rare event in SS. Therefore, we assume that monoallelic loss of chromosome 22 cannot fully elaborate the underlying mechanism of the INI1 staining pattern in all SS, but it could account for the weak to absent INI1 staining in at least some cases.",

     "abstract": "The survival rate in glioblastoma multiforme patients has scarcely improved in the last decades; however, many new therapeutic strategies have been theorized or developed for these neoplasias. Recently, the inverse correlation observed between patient prognosis and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) density in solid tumors has encouraged the development of anti-tumor strategies aiming to target TAMs. As expected, TAMs polarization is influenced by both macrophage localization and tumor microenvironment signals, resulting in a more complex scenario than the simple M1/M2 activation status. Macrophage polarization in glioblastoma has not yet been fully elucidated, and most results have been obtained in experimental non-human settings, with some apparent contradiction. The authors performed a histopathological and immunohistochemical study of 37 cases of glioblastoma in order to characterize the M1 and M2 macrophage populations within TAMs. A high prevalence of CD163+ M2-polarized macrophages was detected in this cohort, whereas iNOS+ macrophages were rarely found. The down-regulation of CD68 expression in microglia/macrophage infiltrating glioblastomas is also reported for the first time. Such a finding is associated with a specific location of TAMs within the lesion, as confirmed by the fact that CD68 staining was lower than CD163, mainly in perivascular areas.The authors discuss the recent literature about the global scenario of macrophage plasticity and polarization in glioblastoma, and suggest some pivotal points for therapeutic applications.",

The remaining groups were negative and positive controls and a sham group. Macroscopic and histopathological examinations were carried out along with determination of the specific biomarker of colonic oxidative stress, the myeloperoxidase (MPO). Compared with controls, the combination therapy exhibited a significant alleviation of colitis in terms of pathological scores and reduction of MPO activity (55%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.0009). Meanwhile, the macroscopic appearance such as stool consistency, tissue and histopathological scores (edema, necrosis and neutrophil infiltration) were improved. Although single therapy by each P. atlantica, butyrate, and L. casei was partially beneficial in reduction of colon oxidative stress markers, the combination therapy was much more effective. In conclusion, the combination therapy was able to reduce the severity of colitis that is clear from biochemical markers.

The main aim of this study was to evaluate tumor angiogenesis parameters in detail and to correlate them with the expression of osteopontin (OPN) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the bone marrow of patients with MGUS and MM. In addition, we wanted to determine their prognostic significance in active MM.Ninety-five patients were enrolled in the study: 14 diagnosed with MGUS, 13 with asymptomatic myeloma (AMM) and 68 with active MM. Computer assisted image analysis was used to determine the angiogenesis parameters, the quantity of microvessels per 1\u00a0mm2 (MVD), the area occupied by microvessels per 1\u00a0mm2 and the percentage of microvessel area in total section area (TVA). Double immunohistochemical methods CD138\u00a0+\u00a0VEGF and CD138\u00a0+\u00a0OPN were used to evaluate expression of these proteins in plasma cells, and OPN was also analyzed for its interstitial expression (iOPN).A significant positive correlation was determined between VEGF and iOPN with angiogenic parameters in the MGUS stage of the disease. In advanced stages of the disease, a significant negative correlation was recorded between OPN and iOPN with parameters of angiogenesis. Overall survival was significantly shorter for patients with negative iOPN (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and higher angiogenic parameters, MVD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009), TVA (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) and area of microvessels per 1\u00a0mm2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02).

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is currently the most aggressive form of brain tumor identified, and STAT3 is known to play an important role in gliomagenesis. Moreover, while several studies have used pharmacological approaches to modulate STAT3 activity, the results have been contradictory. In this study, expressions of STAT3, pSTAT3 (Y705), and pSTAT3 (S727) were evaluated using immunohistochemistry assays of tissue microarrays containing non-neoplastic tissue (NN, n\u00a0=\u00a012), grade II astrocytomas (n\u00a0=\u00a033), grade III astrocytomas (n\u00a0=\u00a012), and GBM (n\u00a0=\u00a085) specimens. In GBM specimens, STAT3 was overexpressed and exhibited greater nuclear localization compared with lower grade astrocytomas and NN. Conversely, nuclear localization of pSTAT3 (Y705) and pSTAT3 (S727) exhibited a similar phenotype in both GBMs and NNs. MET was also detected as a non-canonical pathway marker for STAT3. For tumors with higher levels of STAT3 nuclear localization, and not pSTAT3 (Y705) and pSTAT3 (S727), these specimens exhibited increased levels of MET expression. Thus, a non-canonical pathway may mediate a proportion of the STAT3 that translocates to the nucleus. Moreover, tumors which exhibited greater nuclear localization of STAT3 corresponded with patients that presented with lower rates of recurrence-free survival and overall survival. In contrast, the phosphorylated forms of STAT3 did not correlate with patient survival. These findings suggest that phosphorylation-independent mechanisms may mediate the nuclear translocation and activation of STAT3. Further studies are needed to identify the mechanisms involved, especially those that provide targets to achieve efficient inhibition and control of GBM progression.",

A retrospective study was performed on 22 patients who presented with cystic head and neck SCC metastases. The purpose of the study was to find out whether histological characteristics, p16 protein expression, HPV and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status could be useful in predicting the localization of the primary tumor. The primary site was identified in 20 of 22 patients and included the oropharynx in 14 patients (63.6%), the nasopharynx in 3 patients (13.6%), the lungs in 2 cases (9%), and the skin of the auricle in one case (4.5%). No primary was found in two patients (9%). Sixteen of 17 cases (94.1%) originating in Waldayer\u2019s ring (oropharynx and nasopharynx), and both cases with an unknown primary showed morphology of non-keratinizing SCC or non-keratinizing SCC with maturation. All tumors with oropharyngeal primary and both cases with unknown primary showed diffuse p16 staining and presence of HPV DNA. All three cystic metastases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were EBV-positive and p16/HPV-negative. In contrast, cutaneous and pulmonary metastases showed morphology of a well differentiated keratinizing SCC and poorly differentiated keratinizing SCC, respectively, and were HPV/EBV-negative. We confirmed that cystic SCC lymph node metastases of the head and neck region are strongly associated with the occult primary localized in the oropharynx. The oropharyngeal origin should always be corroborated by p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV-specific testing because SCC arising in other sites, such as nasopharynx, skin or lungs may manifest with cystic neck metastases as well. Addition of EBV testing in p16/HPV-negative cases can disclose the nasopharyngeal origin of the cystic neck metastases in a subset of cases.",

All four cervical hemangiomas were diagnosed incidentally in hysterectomy specimens performed for persistent menorrhagia or pain. The mean age at presentation was 34 years. The mean lesion size was 2.1\u00a0cm and the dominant location was posterior cervix (3 cases). Immunohistochemistry for estrogen and progesterone receptors showed expression of both markers in endothelial cells and stroma, the latter marker showing a stronger and more diffuse pattern. No other significant uterine abnormality was identified in two cases. The vast majority of cervical hemangiomas reported are in reproductive age women. In addition, these lesions express hormone receptors, indicating that their growth is at least in part due to sex hormone stimulation. Although most lesions are symptomatic (mostly bleeding), the diagnosis is frequently unsuspected. Cervical hemangiomas are benign with no recurrences or adverse outcomes reported to date. Conservative treatments are usually successful, and spontaneous remission has been observed. This entity should be included in the differential diagnosis of patients with abnormal vaginal bleeding, particularly in patients of reproductive age with no other clinical and radiologic findings that would explain the symptoms.",

They comprised 50 malignant polyps (MPs) with invasive adenocarcinoma (including 5 with concurrent benign misplaced adenomatous mucosa) and 16 adenomas, 11 with and 5 without benign misplaced adenomatous mucosa.COL11A1 was expressed either diffusely or focally in cancer-associated desmoplastic fibroblasts in 72.0% (36/50) of MPs. The rates of COL11A1 expression and the immunohistochemical staining patterns of the COL11A1 were positively correlated with the depth of cancer invasion in MPs. COL11A1 was expressed in all 9 (100%) MPs with a mucinous component and in 16/18 (88.9%) MPs associated with significant electrocautery effects. COL11A1 was not expressed adjacent to conventional adenomas or in the stroma adjacent to misplaced adenomatous mucosa.COL11A1 antibody can assist in distinguishing the cancer-associated desmoplastic stroma from that associated with misplaced adenomatous mucosa. It is particularly helpful when electrocautery artifacts or mucin pools interfere with the diagnosis of invasive carcinoma. However, COL11A1 has limited value in diagnosing superfically invasive carcinomas with very little desmoplastic stroma due to its low positive rate and focal expression in some cases.",

All animals were randomly divided into three groups. In the ANIT-intoxicated group, mice were intragastrically given 100\u00a0mg/kg ANIT (dissolved in corn oil), while the other groups received an equal volume of vehicle as control. After 24 and 48\u00a0h of ANIT administration, blood samples and liver tissues of all animals were collected for serum biochemistry and hepatic histopathological examinations to evaluate liver injuries with cholestasis. Hepatocellular apoptosis was assessed by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay. The expression of hepatic ER stress-related markers was determined by real-time PCR, immunohistochemical assay and Western blot. ANIT was found to significantly induce liver injury with cholestasis compared with control mice as evidenced by the increase of serum transaminases and total bilirubin (TBil), and histopathological changes in mice. ANIT remarkably induced hepatocellular apoptosis, upregulated the expression of caspase-9 and cytochrome c, and inhibited the gene and protein expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). The gene expression of ER stress\u2013related markers, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), protein kinase R\u2013like ER kinase (PERK), eukaryotic initiation factor 2\u03b1 (eIF2\u03b1), inositol requiring enzyme-1\u03b1 (IRE-1\u03b1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) was upregulated by ANIT in mice.

In the literature, only four studies have described three different invasive gynecologic cancers of epithelial origin identified simultaneously in the same patient.This is the first case in the literature that reports on triple primary ovarian, endometrial and endocervical cancers in a 38-year-old woman with a history of previously treated malignant disease (acute lymphatic leukemia). With a preoperative diagnosis of endocervical adenocarcinoma stage Ib1 (according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics\u2014FIGO), as well as an adnexal mass, she underwent radical hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy. Pathologic examination of the surgical specimen revealed a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the cervix, an endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterine corpus, and a mucinous adenocarcinoma of the left ovary. Eighteen months after appropriate treatment, the patient is free of disease.The incidental diagnosis of more than one tumor is often a post-operative finding, usually with the detection of low-stage neoplasms. Multiple synchronous gynecologic cancers have a better prognosis than metastatic or advanced primitive disease. In a patient with multiple neoplasms, the prognosis is determined by the tumor with the worst prognosis.",

Tumor cells and surrounding stromal cells were assessed separately.Higher expression of MMP-1 in tumor cells comparing to stromal cells was related to male gender (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006), ever smoker (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and pooly differentiated tumor (P\u00a0=\u00a00.043).

Here, we investigated GRHPR expression and its potential role in both human Crohn's disease (CD) and experimental colitis. Murine experimental colitis models were established by administration of trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNBS). As shown by Western blot, significant up-regulation of GRHPR was found in TNBS-treated mice as compared with normal controls. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) also showed increased GRHPR expression, and the molecule was located in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). This phenomenon also occurred in patients with Crohn's disease. Besides, in an in vitro study, human IEC line HT-29 cells cultured with tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were used to evaluate the changes in expression of GRHPR. Moreover, overexpression of GRHPR was accompanied by active caspase-3 and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) accumulation. Furthermore, knock-down GRHPR could inhibit the accumulation of active caspase-3 and cleaved PARP as shown by Western blot in TNF-\u03b1 treated HT-29 cells. Flow cytometry assay indicated that interference of GRHPR led to increasing apoptosis of IECs. These data suggested that GRHPR might exert its pro-apoptosis function in IECs. Thus, GRHPR might play an important role in regulating IECs apoptosis, and might be a potential therapeutic target for CD.",

However, a complete representation of prognostic and predictive factors in AML necessitates an expanded series of genes, due to the dynamic interactions present between concurrent mutations. Hence, the current study aims to describe the benefits of an expanded risk profile in an unselected cohort of AML cases.The genomes of 11 randomly selected patients with AML were sequenced using next generation sequencing. A narrow three gene panel and broader 50 gene panel were contrasted.The expanded gene panel detected one additional pathogenic mutation in five patients and two pathogenic mutations in two patients, resulting in a change in their risk profile. Only 5/11 (45%) of AML patients demonstrated a pathogenic mutation on the 3 gene profile, however all patients had at least one detectable pathogenic mutation on the broader gene panel. The detection of a concurrent mutation by the expanded gene panel reversed the favorable risk profile for three patients.Detection of concurrent mutations enables rejection or validation of prognoses associated with NPM1 or CEBPA mutations. DNMT3a and TP53 mutations in AML have a pertinent prognostic and therapeutic value for patients and their addition enhances the current three gene panel. In our small study, the three gene panel changed the prognosis for three patients (3/11, 27%) with the detection of commonly occurring AML mutations.",

Both H&E and immunohistochemical stained sections were assessed and evaluated according to quick immunoreactivity score.ALDH1A1 expression showed a broad dynamic range of immunoreactivity score (0\u20138) in different types of lung cancers with strong reactivity of normal stem cells. Significant statistical associations were found between ALDH1A1 expression and squamous cell carcinoma & SCLC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02 and 0.003, respectively), with very high mean percentage of positive cells in SCLC (58.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.62), followed by adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma (38.37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a035.12 and 22.77\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.89, respectively). Adenocarcinomas were classified according to the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification and grouped by architectural grade into low, intermediate and high. Heterogeneity of ALDH1A1 immunoreactivity scores within adenocarcinoma can reflect histological patterns heterogeneity with a strong association to the grade. Strong diffuse expression was seen in inflammatory pseudotumors and impressive membranous expression was noticed in metastatic tumors. Important pitfalls of ALDH1A1 immunostaining were applied for accurate interpretations.We ascertained the presence of strong association between ALDH1A1 expression and both histological subtype & tumor grade of NSCLCs. We report a fascinating finding; ALDH1A1 heterogeneity within adenocarcinoma can be mapped to its histological patterns.

Therefore, this study investigated whether new criteria for mixed histology are necessary for ER in EGC.From January 2005 to December 2012, 3419 patients with EGC underwent surgery. Lesions were classified using three histological classifications: the Japanese classification; World Health Organization (WHO) classification including SRC mixed histology; and Lauren classification. The mixed type in the Lauren classification was also reclassified according to the proportion of differentiated and undifferentiated components. Clinicopathological characteristics were compared according to histological classifications, with special reference to the ER criteria.With the Lauren classification, 179 (5.3%) lesions were classified as mixed type, including 54 (30.2%) lesions as the differentiated-predominant mixed type. There were 361 (10.6%) lesions classified as SRC mixed histology. Mixed-type lesions in the Lauren classification and SRC mixed lesions were significantly associated with larger size and a greater LNM. Among the lesions meeting the ER criteria, 20 (1.6%) and 55 (4.7%) were categorized as mixed type by the Lauren classification and SRC mixed histology, respectively. However, there was no LNM among the lesions recategorized into mixed histology.Mixed histology showed no LNM among the lesions met the present ER criteria.

However, the peak level of BrdU- and Ki67-positivity was higher in SIP1 knockout mice than in wild-type mice (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). A higher amount of peak cyclin protein expression was also observed in SIP1 knockout mice. Furthermore, lipid accumulation was observed in SIP1 knockout mice during the liver regeneration process.

The aim of this study was to determine immunohistochemically which growth factors were associated with perlecan in normal oral epithelia and in different epithelial lesions from dysplasia and CIS to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Eighty-one surgical tissue specimens of oral SCC containing different precancerous stages, along with ten of normal mucosa, were examined by immunohistochemistry for growth factors. In normal epithelia, perlecan and growth factors were not definitely expressed. In epithelial dysplasia, VEGF, SHH, KGF, Flt-1, and Flk-1were localized in the lower half of rete ridges (in concordance with perlecan, 33\u2013100%), in which Ki-67 positive cells were densely packed. In CIS, perlecan and those growth factors/receptors were more strongly expressed in the cell proliferating zone (63\u2013100%). In SCC, perlecan and KGF disappeared from carcinoma cells but emerged in the stromal space (65\u2013100%), while VEGF, SHH, and VEGF receptors remained positive in SCC cells (0%). Immunofluorescence showed that the four growth factors were shown to be produced by three oral SCC cell lines and that their signals were partially overlapped with perlecan signals.

The tumor was incidentally detected at a mammographic screening, and, ultrasonographically, presented as a single, well-circumscribed nodule. On needle core biopsy, the diagnosis of SFT was suggested based on a proliferation of CD34-positive spindly cells set in a fibrous stroma containing medium-sized blood vessels with hyalinization of their walls and branching configuration. The diagnosis was confirmed in the excised specimen, which exhibited a tumor with an immunohistochemical profile consistent with SFT, including diffuse expression of CD34, CD99 and bcl2. As STAT6 nuclear immunoexpression is the result of the inv12(q13q13)-derived NAB2\u2013STAT6 fusion, which characterizes SFT, we analyzed immunohistochemically our case with a commercially available anti-STAT6 antibody. We showed that mammary SFT exhibits a diffuse nuclear STAT6 immunoreactivty, suggesting its potential diagnostic role. The present case emphasizes that the diagnosis of SFT can be confidentially rendered on needle core biopsy. Although SFT is suspected on characteristic morphologic features, immunohistochemistry, revealing immunoreactivity for CD34, bcl-2, CD99 and STAT6, is crucial in the differential diagnosis of potential benign and malignant mimics.",

Computed tomography showed that the mass was protruding anteriorly from the left-sided pancreas. Because of the enlargement of the mass lesion, distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed after about 3 months. Macroscopically, the mass was encapsulated and approximately 8\u00a0cm in diameter. Histological examination revealed that spindle or blunt stellate cells were proliferating in parallel or storiform fashion with myxoid and fibrous background. The tumor cells did not show prominent atypia and mitoses were rarely seen, suggesting that the tumor was low grade or borderline. Immunohistochemistry showed obvious nuclear staining of beta-catenin. Furthermore, analysis of beta-catenin gene revealed that the tumor had a typical missense mutation of threonine to alanine at colon 41 (T41A) in exon 3. These findings confirmed the pathological diagnosis of DTF of the pancreas. To the best of our knowledge, 18 cases of pancreatic DTF have been reported in the English literature and beta-catenin gene mutation had been examined in only one case among them.

However, the potential effect of CM on 6-OHDA-injured substantia nigra (SN) needs to be investigated. This study aimed to further evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of CM against damaged SN in rats. Methodologically, Parkinson's disease (PD) rat was prepared by using a surgical approach of injecting 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) into the SN. Morris water maze, open-field assays, and rotarod test were used to assess the neurobehavioral manifestations. Neurotransmitter contents in the SN were determined by using the biochemical tests. Western blotting was employed to evaluate the target protein expressions. The representative data showed that CM protected against 6-OHDA-induced neural impairments in the SN, as evidenced by improved memory abilities, elevated intercalatum levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and reduced concentration of malonaldehyde (MDA). In addition, dopamine (DA) and acetylcholine (ACh) levels were increased in the SN. Moreover, intercalatum heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was lowered, while basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and receptor tyrosine kinase A (TrkA) expressions were up-regulated, respectively. Taken together, the findings indicate that curcum in exerts neuroprotection in the SN via ameliorating neurofunctions of PD rats.",

Eighteen of 20 (90%) biopsies of chronic pancreatitis were negative for IMP3, while the other two cases (10%) showed weak and focal IMP3 immunoreactivity. On the other hand, mesothelin demonstrated positive immunoreactivity in 30 of 40 (75%) cases of PDA. The staining reaction was moderate to strong in 24 (60%) cases and diffuse in 22 (55%) cases. Sixteen of 20 (80%) biopsies of chronic pancreatitis were negative for mesothelin, while weak and focal mesothelin staining was detected in the other 4 cases. All normal pancreatic tissues were negative for IMP3 and mesothelin expression. IMP3 showed higher sensitivity (85%) and specificity (90%) than mesothelin (75% and 80%, respectively).Our results showed that IMP3 immunostaining has a higher sensitivity and specificity than mesothelin for the diagnosis of PDA.

Here, the presence and localization of these proteins was assessed by immunohistochemistry using articular cartilage from OA patients, revealing colocalization of C/EBP\u03b2 and GADD45\u03b2 in OA chondrocytes. GADD45\u03b2 promoter analysis was performed to determine whether C/EBP\u03b2 directly regulates GADD45\u03b2 transcription. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of C/EBP\u03b2 on Gadd45\u03b2 gene regulation in articular chondrocytes in vivo and in vitro. Immunohistochemical analysis of C/ebp\u03b2-haploinsufficient mice (C/ebp\u03b2+/\u2212) cartilage showed that C/ebp\u03b2 haploinsufficiency led to reduced Gadd45\u03b2 gene expression in these cells. In vitro, we evaluated the effects of conditional C/EBP\u03b2 overexpression driven by the cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (Comp) promoter in mComp-tTA;pTRE-Tight-BI-DsRed-mC/ebp\u03b2 transgenic mice. C/EBP\u03b2 overexpression significantly stimulated Gadd45\u03b2 gene expression in articular chondrocytes. Taken together, our data demonstrate that C/EBP\u03b2 plays a central role in controlling Gadd45\u03b2 gene expression in these cells.",

However, whether RSV-induced improvement in kidney function in diabetes is due to the regulation of autophagy remains unclear. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying RSV-mediated protection against DN in diabetic rats, with a special focus on the role of NAD-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) in regulating autophagy. We found that long-term RSV treatment in rats promoted Sirt1 expression and improved related metabolic levels in the diabetic kidney. Our study showed that, in cultured NRK-52E cells, Sirt1 knockdown inhibited the autophagy levels of proteins Atg7, Atg5, and LC3 and impaired the RSV amelioration of dysfunctional autophagy under hypoxic condition. Furthermore, exposed to 1% O2 over time induced autophagy dysfunction and apoptosis in NRK-52E cells, which could be improved by RSV treatment. Our data highlight the role of the Sirt1-mediated pathway in the effects of RSV on autophagy in vivo and in vitro, suggesting RSV could be a potential new therapy for type 2 DN.",

Leptin and SIRT1 levels in osteosarcoma samples from 89 patients were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The correlations between Leptin and SIRT1 expression with clinical parameters were analyzed by Spearman's test and Pearson's chi-squared test. Prognostic factors were identified by Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis. We found that Leptin and SIRT1 expression was low in 23.6% and 20.2%; moderate in 25.8% and 24.7%; and high in 50.5% and 55.1% of patients with osteosarcoma, respectively. Both Leptin and SIRT1 expression were significantly associated with the Enneking stage, distant metastasis and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Leptin expression and SIRT1 expression were significantly correlated and they were significantly associated with shorter overall survival. Among osteosarcoma patients who received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, both Leptin and SIRT1 expression were significantly associated with overall survival of osteosarcoma patients in univariate analysis, but only SIRT1 expression was significantly associated with overall survival of osteosarcoma patients in multivariate analysis. In conclusion, Leptin and SIRT1 expressions are significantly associated with shorter overall survival of osteosarcoma patients, and SIRT1 expression is a significant independent prognostic indicator in patients with osteosarcoma.",

Alternatively, physical exercise is an important strategy for the management of diabetes. This study aimed to investigate the influence of low-intensity swimming training in cardiac cytokines, structural remodeling, and cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction in growing rats with untreated experimental DM. Thirty-day-old male Wistar rats were divided into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a014, per group): sedentary control (SC), exercised control (EC), sedentary diabetic (SD), and exercised diabetic (ED). Diabetes was induced by streptozotocin (60\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121, i.p.). Animals from exercised groups swam (5 days/week, 90\u00a0min/day, loading up to 5% body weight around the animal's chest) for 8 weeks. The left ventricle (LV) was removed for molecular, morphological, and cardiomyocyte mechanical analysis. Diabetic animals presented cardiac remodeling with myocardial histoarchitectural disorganization, fibrosis, and necrosis. The capillary density was lower in diabetic animals. LV cardiomyocytes from diabetic animals exhibited more prolonged time to the peak of contraction and time to half relaxation than those from control animals. The cardiac levels of interleukin 10, nitric oxide, and total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin were significantly decreased in diabetic animals. Exercise training reduced the level of TNF-\u03b1, increased capillary density, and attenuated the histopathological parameters assessed in diabetic rats. In conclusion, the cardiac structural remodeling coexists with reduced levels of total and HMW adiponectin, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte contractility dysfunction in experimental DM. More important, low-intensity swimming training attenuates part of these pathological changes, indicating the beneficial role for exercise in untreated T1DM.",

Although the clinical course, radiologic and pathologic examinations enable distinction in most cases, difficulties are still encountered by the pathologists. There is no known biomarker to help make a distinction between benign and malignant cartilaginous tumors. Insulin-like growth factor II mRNA binding protein (IMP3) is a member of an oncofetal family of proteins that is expressed in different human malignancies and rapidly emerging as a prognostic and diagnostic marker in surgical pathology. In this study, IMP3 expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 36 enchondromas and 42 chondrosarcomas of different histologic grades. The results showed that all 36 cases of enchondroma were negative for IMP3, while it was overexpressed in 15 of 42 chondrosarcomas (36%) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Significant higher levels of IMP3 were detected in grade III chondrosarcomas (6 of 7; 85.7%) when compared to low-grade tumors (6 of 19; 31.5% in grade II and 3 of 16; 18.7% in Atypical Cartilaginous Tumor). We proved statistically significant difference in IMP3 expression between enchondromas and ACTs (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025). Our study clearly demonstrated differentiation-dependent expression of IMP3 in chondrosarcoma, and suggests IMP3 as a novel marker for differentiating problematic cases of enchondroma from well-differentiated chondrosarcomas.

     "abstract": "The aim of the study was to investigate the expression of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)-inducing transcription factors, including Twist1 and ZEB1, in skeletal extramedullary disease (EMD) of multiple myeloma (MM) patients and to clarify the effects on clinical outcomes. The expression of Twist1 and ZEB1 in the bone marrow (BM) and the masses of skeletal EMD from 70 MM cases with skeletal EMD and 30 MM patients without skeletal EMD were determined by immunohistochemistry. The results demonstrated that the percentage of high nuclear staining for Twist1 was 24.3% (17/70) in skeletal EMD, which was significantly higher than in the BM of these patients as well as those without skeletal EMD (P\u00a0=\u00a00.030 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.011). The microvessel density (MVD, P\u00a0=\u00a00.004) was significantly higher in patients with high nuclear expression of Twist1 (Twist1-high) than in those with low expression. Patients with Twist1-high experienced a lower rate of progression-free survival (PFS, 11.8% vs. 35.0%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.000) and overall survival (OS, 52.5% vs. 83.7%, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001) compared to those with low expression. Multivariate analysis showed that Twist1-high was independently associated with inferior PFS (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.161; 95%CI: 1.116\u20134.183; P\u00a0=\u00a00.022) and OS (HR\u00a0=\u00a03.111; 95%CI: 1.114\u20138.685; P\u00a0=\u00a00.030). We concluded that Twist1-high is associated with a poor prognosis and may be correlated with angiogenesis in the skeletal EMD of MM patients.",

We evaluated whether the analysis of supplemental slides of prostate periphery changed margin status, presence of EPE, Gleason score and extent of PCM and EPE.Partial sampling resulted in missing 29% of PCM and 20% of EPE without using data from the supplemental slides of prostate periphery. Changes from focal to extensive disease were found in 11/21 (52%) cases of positive circumferential margins and in 5/13 (38%) cases of extraprostatic extension.

We report a recently classified clear cell (tubulo) papillary renal cell carcinoma as part of an unusual case of multifocal renal cell carcinoma of discordant histological subtypes.A 57 year-old-man was found to have multiple renal tumors and cysts on imaging and underwent a laparoscopic left radical nephrectomy. Pathological review showed multifocal renal cell carcinoma (clear cell (tubulo) papillary, clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinomas and papillary adenomas). Morphology of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma was supported by immunohistochemical profile (CK7+, HMWK+, CAIX+, AMACR\u2212, CD10\u2212, TFE3\u2212).This is the first report of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma as part of multifocal renal cell carcinoma of different histological subtypes. Related lineage of clear cell renal cell carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma is supported by the highest prevalence of their combination within multifocal renal cell carcinoma of different histological subtypes along with their molecular interconnection. Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma may be uniquely placed between clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinomas since it shows morphological features intermediate between clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinoma along with overlapping but unique immunohistochemical profile.Clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma may be molecularly related to clear cell and papillary renal cell carcinomas since the tumors overexpress markers of HIF pathway activation with normal/elevated VHL mRNA expression and some tumors show losses of chromosome 3. Due to the overlapping morphology, it is possible that cases of clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma may have been misclassified as papillary or clear cell renal cell carcinoma in the literature, incorrectly increasing their reported prevalence. Identification of multifocal RCCs may be related to the extent of pathological sampling.",

The parameters defining the PI (venous invasion, peritoneal involvement, circumferential margin involvement, perforation through the tumour) and performance of the PI were compared in two institutions.The two series of patients consisted of 127 and 87 patients. Venous invasion was more frequently detected at one of the centres (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and tumour perforation was more frequent at the other (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

Although the most important risk factors for esophageal carcinoma are alcohol and smoking, viral infections, particularly HPV infection, are also considered among etiological agents. Our study aims to detect the presence of HPV in esophageal cancers in our patient population and to investigate its correlation with clinico-pathological parameters.We investigated the presence of HPV-DNA by real-time polymerase chain reaction in a total of 52 patients with esophageal cancer. Subtype analysis was performed in positive cases and was correlated with selected clinico-pathological parameters.Five (9.6%) of 52 tumor samples, 3 squamous cell carcinomas (3/33 cases) and 2 adenocarcinomas (2/19 cases), were HPV-DNA-positive. Subtype analysis could be performed in four HPV-DNA-positive cases, of which three were HPV type-39 and 1 was type-16. The Marmara region, where the present study was carried out, is a region with low-moderate risk for esophageal cancer, and the prevalence of HPV-DNA in these tumors is similar to the prevalence of HPV-DNA reported in the literature for regions with similar risk.In conclusion, we detected HPV DNA in a subset of esophageal and gastroesophageal junction tumors. HPV infection may have a role in esophageal carcinogenesis and high-risk HPV subtypes can particularly be considered among risk factors since the prevalence of high risk HPV infection has also been found to be increased in regions with a high risk for esophageal cancer compared to low-moderate risk regions.",

It does so specifically through inhibiting function of this enzyme and by inhibiting the transcriptional activity of positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play a role in the progression of prostate adenocarcinomas. We investigated the clinicopathological significance of Hexim1, TGF\u03b2, SMAD2, and SMAD7 expression in prostate adenocarcinoma cells, and assessed associations between TAMs density and these proteins.The cases of 100 patients diagnosed with prostate acinar adenocarcinoma who had undergone radical prostatectomy were retrospectively examined. Each was reviewed for Gleason score, cancer stage, and specific histopathological features. Original slides were re-examined, and new slides were prepared and immunostained with Hexim1, TGF\u03b2, SMAD2, SMAD7 and CD68.Hexim1 expression was positively correlated with Gleason score, cancer stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, and positive surgical margin. TAMs density was positively correlated with Gleason score, cancer stage, perineural invasion, extracapsular extension, and positive surgical margin. TAMs density was positively correlated with Hexim1 expression and TGF\u03b2 expression. More advanced cancer stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and extracapsular extension were correlated with strong Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild SMAD7 expression, respectively. Strong Hexim1 expression, strong TGF\u03b2 expression, and mild SMAD7 expression were associated with higher Gleason score. Strong Hexim1 expression was correlated with strong TGF\u03b2 expression and mild SMAD7 expression. Strong Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild expression of SMAD7 were associated with disease progression. Strong SMAD2 expression was associated with shorter disease-free survival.The results suggest that greater TAMs density, strong Hexim1 expression, strong SMAD2 expression, and mild SMAD7 expression play important roles in the progression of prostate adenocarcinoma. Further investigation of these proteins will help facilitate the definitive prognosis of prostate adenocarcinomas. Ultimately, these proteins may be therapeutic targets for patients with prostate cancer.",

It consists of tubules, microcysts and papillae lined by a single layer of low cuboidal epithelium without atypia. Recently, a fibromyxoid variant mimicking an infiltrating mucinous adenocarcinoma has been described. We report hereby the case of a 70-year-old female with a fibromixoid NA protruding in a renal cortical cyst. Only one case of NA in a renal cortical cyst has been found in the literature and it was of the classical type. The development of a NA in a renal cortical cyst lends support to the theory that the NA results from proliferation of secondarily implanted exfoliated renal epithelial cells.",

A 50-year-old man with malaise and jaundice was found to have a mass in the pancreatic head at a local hospital. He was clinically diagnosed with IPMC with invasion to the stomach and duodenum after extensive endoscopic and radiological evaluation and a pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. Histologically, most of the lesion exhibited proliferation of atypical glands, with irregular papillary and villoglandular structures lined by mucinous columnar epithelium, which extended intraepithelially along the dilated pancreatic duct wall. Tumor cells spread into the duodenal wall formed mucous nodules. The pancreatic ducts of this lesion uniquely showed two malformations; PBM, and an aberrant pancreatic duct opening to the gastric wall. This case was rare in the sense that IPMC extended into such unique structures. We report a case of IPMC with rare localization. The pathogenesis of this type of tumor in an abnormal pancreatic duct will be discussed.",

Tumor size, tumor stage, lymph node status, lymphovascular invasion, histopathologic grade, mitotic count, necrosis, tumor budding, tumor stroma ratio, stroma type, stromal lymphoplasmacytic reaction and ratios of stromal plasma cells and their relationship with the prognosis were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for histopathological markers for local disease free survival (LDFS), distant disease free survival (DDFS), overall disease free survival (ODFS) and overall survival (OS).The univariate prognostic analysis of the pathological factors revealed that the pathological stage (OS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.001, DDFS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.040), lymph node metastases (OS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.013), mitotic index (OS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.026), tumor necrosis (DDFS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.013, ODFS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.021) and tumor size (OS: p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) had a prognostic significance.

Marker expression was analyzed in 62 endometrial cancer samples (57 endometrioid carcinoma and 5 carcinosarcoma) and 15 proliferative endometrium samples. We detected CD133 and CD44 expression in 87.09% and 79.03% respectively of the studied endometrial cancers, and the expression was significantly different from the normal group. CD44 expression decreased with myometrial invasive depth and lymph-vascular space invasion (LVSI), and these inverse relationships were significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.034, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019, respectively). CD133 was more expressed by early stage tumor (FIGO I-II) compared with those having FIGO III to IV stage disease (p\u00a0=\u00a00.021). The most notable conclusion of the present study is that CD44 and CD133 might participate in early-stage endometrial cancer carcinogenesis, and their overexpression may facilitate the early diagnosis of endometrial cancers. Analysis of our results supports the hypothesis that CD44 expression tends to decrease as the disease becomes invasive and progressive. So, we concluded that CD44 down-regulation might warn of a more aggressive course and may have a link with poorly prognosis carcinosarcomas. Further examination of the expression and function of CD44 and CD133 with a greater number of carcinosarcomas is warranted.",

     "abstract": "Manganese super oxide dismutase (MnSOD) has been previously identified as one of the top regulated genes associated with poor survival in glioblastoma (GBM) patients. In the current study we have evaluated the protein expression of MnSOD across various grades of astrocytoma, studied its influence on survival of GBM patients and following recurrence.The protein expression of MnSOD was analyzed on tumor tissue sections by immunohistochemistry on 30 diffuse astrocytomas (DA), 50 anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 30 paired (primary and recurrent) GBM samples and 30 non-tumor brain tissues. The protein expression among the different grades of diffusely infiltrating astrocytoma (DIA) was evaluated by Kruskal\u2013Wallis one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc test. Wilcoxon matched pair test was employed to assess MnSOD protein expression across 30 paired GBM samples (primary and recurrent). The prognostic impact of MnSOD protein expression individually and following stratification with p53 expression was evaluated in a cohort of 123 GBM patients. Both over-all survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) analysis were performed by employing Cox regression analysis and Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis on GBM patients.A significantly increased protein expression of MnSOD was observed among malignant astrocytomas (GBM and AA) in comparison with either DA or non-tumor brain tissues (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Among the GBM cases it was noted that the IDH1 immunopositive tumors (R132H mutant protein; n\u00a0=\u00a017) had a low MnSOD expression as opposed to IDH1 immunonegative tumors (n\u00a0=\u00a0106), which had high expression of MnSOD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0307). Further, a statistically significant increase (p\u00a0=\u00a00.010) in extent of MnSOD protein expression was also noted in GBM tumors following recurrence. Protein expression of MnSOD was associated with both poor OS (HR: 1.021; p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and early PFS (HR: 1.022; p\u00a0=\u00a00.006) on univariate analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis as well as Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis demonstrated similar poor prognostic association. Stratification of GBM cases based on p53 expression status revealed a strong association of MnSOD with OS (HR: 1.042; p\u00a0=\u00a00.002) and PFS (HR: 1.044; p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) in p53 positive tumor tissue samples. Similar findings were noted on multivariate Cox regression analysis and K\u2013M survival analysis, while no such association was noted in tumor tissues staining negative for p53 expression.Our study shows an increased expression of MnSOD in anaplastic astrocytoma and GBM compared to low grade astrocytoma and control brain. An increase in MnSOD expression following GBM tumor recurrence strengthens its putative role in tumor aggressiveness. Further, MnSOD emerges as a poor prognostic biomarker in p53 expressing GBMs, rendering this molecule as a potential therapeutic target in such patients.",

We analyzed 323 BC patients who had distant relapse during follow-up from 1997 to 2010 to determine the significant clinicopathologic factors predicting survival outcomes. By univariate analysis, race, tumor grade, estrogen and progesterone receptors (ER/PR) and HER2 status were significantly associated with overall survival (OS) and post-metastasis survival (PMS). Applying a Cox regression model revealed that all these factors remained significant for PMS, while race, tumor grade and HER2 were independent factors for OS. Tumor grade was the only significant factor for metastasis-free survival by univariate and multivariate analyses. Our findings demonstrated that being Caucasian, hormonal receptor positive (HR+) and HER2 positive (HER2+) were all associated with a decreased hazard of death and that patients with HR+/HER2+ tumors had superior outcomes to those with HR+/HER2\u2212 disease. Further, PR status held a prognostic value over ER, thus reflecting the biologic mechanism of the importance of the functional ER pathway and the heterogeneity in the response to endocrine therapy. These observations indicate that the patients\u2019 genetic makeup and the intrinsic nature of the tumor principally govern BC progression and prognosticate the long-term outcomes in advanced disease.",

During a five-year period, 60 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma underwent surgical resection at a single institution. Immunohistochemical stains of the studied markers were quantified by Image analysis system. ER\u03b1 expression was positively associated with PR expression. Moreover, ER\u03b2 was inversely associated with the presence of metastases, whereas no significant associations implicated AR. As far as the prognostic significance of the studied receptors is concerned, higher ER\u03b1 expression correlated with poorer survival at the univariate analysis, but the finding dissipated at the multivariate approach. No significant associations with overall survival were noted regarding the other receptors. The role of sex hormone receptors in the survival from pancreatic adenocarcinoma seems rather limited.

We developed a diagnostic system for FN in CNB specimens and aimed to validate the clinical usefulness of the method compared with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). We reviewed 5993 FNACs and 1303 CNBs from the pathology database at Seoul St. Mary's Hospital between August 2012 and December 2014. The diagnostic rate of FN was significantly higher in CNB than in FNAC (15.7% vs. 2.4%, respectively; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). A total of 289 cases (117 FNACs and 172 CNBs) were confirmed histologically after surgical resection. NRAS mutation testing was performed with pyrosequencing. Comparing the FNAC and CNB groups, there were no differences in the positive predictive values for neoplasm (84.6% vs. 89.0%, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.200) and malignancy (48.7% vs. 43.0%, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.340). When we excluded the noninvasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary carcinoma from the malignancy group, there was also no significant difference in the malignancy risk between the two groups (22.7% and 27.4% in the CNB and FNAC groups, respectively; P\u00a0=\u00a00.365). The NRAS mutation rate was 26.5% (57/215) in all FNs and occurred with similar frequency in both groups. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of a NRAS testing to predict malignancy were 40.6%, 84.9%, 68.4%, and 63.9%. In conclusion, FN was more frequently diagnosed in the CNB group than in the FNAC group, but the rates of malignancy, neoplasm, and NRAS mutation were equivalent in both groups.

     "abstract": "Hepatic carcinosarcoma (HCS) is an aggressive tumor for which a consensus regarding the clonal origin has not yet been reached. The aim of the study was to identify the origin of the hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and sarcoma components in HCS.We chose microsatellite technique containing loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and microsatellite instability (MSI) on three HCS patients who underwent curative resection confirmed by pathological examination. Tumors were firstly analyzed for Hep Par 1, CK18, CD10, CD117, SMA and vimentin expression by immunohistochemistry. LOH and MSI were then investigated. The incidence rate of LOH/MSI in all nine MS was calculated as the fractional allelic loss (FAL) index, which was internationally recognized standard. A FAL\u00a0<\u00a030% was representative of a monoclonal origin and a FAL\u00a0\u2265\u00a030% indicated a polyclonal origin.All patients were positive for HBsAg. Microscopic examination showed HCS containing two different cell types: a fibrosarcoma component with spindle cells and an HCC population of cells with a trabecular pattern. In the HCC tumor portions, Hep Par 1, CK18, CD10 were expressed while vimentin was not. In contrast, the spindle cell populations were positive for vimentin and negative for Hep Par 1, CK18, CD10. The highest frequencies of LOH and MSI were at the D16S505 (2/3; 66.7%), D17S831 (2/3; 66.7%) and D17S938 MS (2/3; 66.7%). The FALs for the three cases of HCS were 50% (4/8), 55.6% (5/9) and 33.3% (3/9), suggesting a polyclonal origin.Immunohistochemistry and analysis of LOH and MSI strongly demonstrated that the three HCS samples were consistent with a polyclonal origin for all three cases.",

The tumors ranged in size from 2.3 to 12.0\u00a0cm (average diameter, 7.85\u00a0cm). The tumors were composed of spindle cells with oval, fusiform or banded nuclei that were arranged in bundled, storiform or peculiar random patterns. Mitosis and hemangiopericytoma-like vessels were occasionally observed. Immunohistochemically, three cases were positive for Signal transduction and activator of transcription 6, cluster of differentiation 34, B-cell lymphoma-2 and vimentin but were negative for nervous, muscular and hepatocellular markers. Hepatic lobectomy was performed in all cases, and one patient received adjuvant chemotherapy simultaneously. One patient suffered two recurrences without metastasis, and the remaining patients experienced favorable outcomes.A consensus on the essential and definite diagnostic criteria for primary hepatic solitary fibrous tumor must be reached in a timely manner. Signal transduction and activator of transcription 6 is a highly sensitive and specific immunohistochemical marker for primary hepatic solitary fibrous tumor.",

Accordingly, HCA is currently classified into four molecular subtypes as adopted by the World Health Organization. The present study was firstly to characterize and determine the genetic alterations and clinicopathological features of the largest series of HCAs in China. We reviewed 189 patients with HCA who underwent hepatectomies at our liver center from January 1984 to January 2012, among which 36 HCAs were randomly selected for the sequencing of HNF1\u03b1, \u03b2-catenin and gp130 genes, and 60 HCAs were randomly selected for detecting microsatellite instability (MSI). Compared with Western studies, our data showed distinctive findings including male (69.8%) and overweight/obese (50.3%) predominance. Only 3.5% of female patients had a documented history of OCs use for 2\u20134 years. All 36 sequenced HCAs showed HNF1\u03b1 mutations (72% missense, 28% synonymous), 2 hotspot polymorphisms of HNF1\u03b1 (I27L: rs1169288 and S487N: rs2464196) were seen in 17 (47%) and 10 (27.8%) cases, respectively, and a novel single nucleotide polymorphism site (rs1169304) in intron 9 of HNF1\u03b1 was detected in 32 (88%) cases, but no \u03b2-catenin or gp130 gene mutation was detected, and no nuclear \u03b2-catenin staining was detected by immunohistochemistry. The frequency of MSI was 75% for D12S1398 (HNF1\u03b1 inactivated pathway) and 78.5% for D6S1064 (HIPPO signaling pathway) in 34 overweight/obese patients with HCA. Our results firstly indicate that patients with HCA in China frequently occur in male overweigh and obese adult population, lack an association with OCs use and exhibit unique genetic alterations. Taken together, these observations suggest that alternative pathogenetic pathways involve in HCA tumorigenesis in Chinese patients.",

     "abstract": "Carcinoma-associated fibroblasts found at the interface between a tumor and the normal stroma play several roles in the development of cancer, including cancer initiation, growth, and progression, thereby also affecting patient prognosis. Although recent studies have focused on carcinoma-associated fibroblasts as potential treatment targets, the origin of these fibroblasts remains unclear. One theory suggests that these cells arise from tumor cells undergoing the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition, i.e., tumor cells transform into carcinoma-associated fibroblasts. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to elucidate the cellular origin of carcinoma-associated fibroblasts in a mouse xenograft model. Mice were transplanted with human lung cancer cells (H226 and A549 cells). After sacrifice, tumor masses and surrounding tissues were excised. Interestingly, the excised xenograft tissues contained a significant proportion of desmoplastic fibroblasts that exhibited strong expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (SMA). Immunohistochemical staining with pan-cytokeratin, vimentin, \u03b2-catenin, E-cadherin, and CD34 showed no evidence of the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition. Additional evaluation using dual-color silver in situ hybridization with dinitrophenyl-labeled human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and digoxigenin-labeled chromosome 17 centromere probes also showed similar results. In conclusion, our results revealed that the epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition may not occur in tumor xenograft models, regardless of evidence supporting this phenomenon in humans.",

CD10 and Bcl2 antigens are important factors in tumor growth, survival and spread. The aim of the present study is to define the frequency of CD10 and Bcl2 expression in such cutaneous tumors and its relation to the clinicopathological characteristics as well as their possible diagnostic utility. CD10 and Bcl2 immunohistochemistry was performed on 30 BCC, 20 SCC and 15 SK. 93.3% of SK cases and 53.3% of BCC cases showed significant expression of CD10 in tumor cells when compared either with each other or with SCC cases (100% negative). Stromal CD10 expression was positive in 50% of BCC cases and 75% of SCC cases. Stromal CD10 expression was significantly higher in high risk BCC and BCC with infiltrating deep margins; furthermore, it showed a significant positive correlation with grade of SCC. A significant inverse correlation between CD10 expression in stromal and tumor cells of BCC was present. Bcl2 was significantly expressed in 93.3% of SK cases and 80% of BCC cases when compared with SCC cases (100% negative). It was found that for distinguishing BCC from SK, only CD10 expression in tumor cells provided a high diagnostic value with positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 7.00. In addition, CD10 and Bcl2 expression in tumor cells could give convincing diagnostic value to distinguish SCC from SK (PLR\u00a0=\u00a015.00 for each marker). Moreover, for differentiating BCC from SCC, only Bcl2 in the tumor cells could provide a high diagnostic value (PLR\u00a0=\u00a05.5). In conclusion, CD10 and Bcl2 can help in differentiating cutaneous BCC from SK and SCC. The overexpression of CD10 in the stromal cells of SCC and some variants of BCC suggests the invasive properties of such tumors.",

However, the clinic relevance of Gankyrin expression in NSCLC remains unclear.Gankyrin expression was assessed using immunohistochemical (IHC) methods in 166 paired paraffin-embedded NSCLC specimens and adjacent normal tissues. Semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blotting were employed to measure the expression of Gankyrin in 24 paired fresh NSCLC specimens and the corresponding normal tissues. The association of Gankyrin expression with clinicopathological parameters was also evaluated. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the effect of Gankyrin expression on survival.Data showed that Gankyrin was expressed in 78.3% (130/166) and 28.9% (48/166) of cancer lesions and corresponding adjacent normal tissue, respectively. And the Gankyrin overexpression in tumor tissue occurred in 53.6% (89/166) of patients, while overexpression of Gankyrin in normal tissue occurred only in 4.8% (8/166) of patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting showed that NSCLC specimens had increased Gankyrin mRNA and protein expression compared to the corresponding normal tissues. Out of all the clinicopathological factors analyzed, Gankyrin overexpression was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and p-TNM stage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Gankyrin-overexpressed NSCLC patients had a significantly shorter survival time (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, Log-rank test), and the prognostic significance of Gankyrin overexpression was apparent in both squamous cell carcinoma patients (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028) and adenocarcinoma patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Data were analyzed with principal components analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). As a result, Rhizoma paridis saponins (RPS) or RT induced inflammatory cell infiltration in tumors. RT also mediated the tumor microenvironment to promote anti-tumor immunity of mice. RT significantly inhibited tumor growth rate through suppressing levels of amino acids containing alanine, asparagine, glutamine, putrescine, and sarcosine, lipid compounds, and carbohydrates like myo-inositol and arabinose in the tumor tissues. In conclusion, these results uncovered unexpectedly poor nutritional conditions in the RT-treated tumor tissues whose effect was stronger than RPS's. Therefore, RT could be a novel anticancer agent that targets on cancer metabolism through starving tumors reducing viability of cancer cells.",

There is accumulating evidence that nuclear factor 45 (NF45) and regulatory pathways are important in understanding reparative processes in the myocardium. NF45 is a multifunctional regulator of gene expression that participates in the regulation of DNA break repair. Recently, NF45 has been proved to be associated with tumor cell apoptosis in various human malignancies. However, the underlying mechanism of NF45 regulating myocardial ischemia\u2013reperfusion (I/R) injury remains unclear. In this study, western blot showed that NF45 expression decreased after myocardial I/R in vivo. Double immunofluorescent staining revealed that NF45, located in the nucleus of cardiomyocyes, was correlated with cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, NF45 expression decreased in H9c2 cells after hypoxia\u2013reoxygenation (H/R) treatment in vitro, which was in line with the results in vivo. Overexpression of NF45 in H9c2 cells reduced cell apoptosis, as evidenced by increased Bcl-2 level, as well as decreased cleaved caspase-3, p53 and p21 expression. The expression of NF45 was reduced by LY294002 (a PI3K/Akt inhibitor), but not SB203580 (a p38 inhibitor), suggesting that NF45 prevented H/R-induced H9c2 cell apoptosis via PI3K/Akt pathway.

Several reports have linked the overexpression of integrins with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Furthermore, fucosylated haptoglobin (Hp) isoforms with antioxidant activity and synthesized primarily in the liver have also been associated with various types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. Here, we determined the level of expression of three integrin heterodimers (\u03b15\u03b21, \u03b16\u03b24, and \u03b1V\u03b23) and fucosyltated Hp in two different settings: cell cultures and biopsies from ovarian cancer patients. On the one hand, integrin heterodimers were analyzed in the ovarian cancer cell line (SKOV-3), two primary cultures (INCan017 and INCan019) and a tumor derived from INCan017 (T-017) by Western blot. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA. The SKOV-3 cell line, INCan017 and INCan019 primary cultures, and the T-017 tumor showed increased expression patterns of the \u03b15, \u03b1V, \u03b21, \u03b23, and \u03b24 integrin subunits when compared with healthy ovary tissue.

However, the statistical analysis showed no association of the presence of integrins, Hp or fucosylation with clinical or pathological characteristics of EOC patients. These results suggest that increased expression of these molecules and of the fucosylation modification are characteristics of the malignant process itself.

Since the literature is limited, we undertook a study to evaluate its diagnostic value in a series of thymic epithelial tumors.Glut-1 expression was studied by the group of pathologists linked to the French national oncological network RYTHMIC. Immunostaining was performed on a whole section of one paraffin block in a series of 92 successive surgical specimens. Patterns (focal, zonal, diffuse) and intensity of Glut-1 expression were assessed and compared with WHO histological subtypes.Expression was mainly restricted to epithelial cells. Immature T-lymphocytes were negative. A diffuse, moderate or strong staining was observed in most thymic carcinomas (15/16). In B3 thymomas (10/11) and in B3 thymomas borderline to thymic carcinomas (5/6), a moderate to strong zonal staining was observed at distance from vessels and fibrous septa. This pattern sometimes created the aspect of an anastomosing network in large cellular lobules. In B1 thymomas, immunostaining highlighted foci of medullary differentiation (7/8). B2 thymomas (n\u00a0=\u00a025) were heterogeneous, with a spectrum of patterns ranging between those of B1 and B3 thymomas. Type A thymomas (n\u00a0=\u00a05) mostly presented a weak positivity but one aggressive case showed zonal moderate/strong positivity. Most AB thymomas (15/17) showed weak to moderate immunostaining in spindle cell areas. In micronodular thymomas (n\u00a0=\u00a03), epithelial cells and B-lymphocytes were weakly positive while follicular dendritic cells were strongly highlighted. One metaplastic thymoma displayed diffuse and moderate positivity.Glut-1 expression globally depended on histological subtypes and the staining patterns (diffuse or zonal) were different between thymic carcinomas and type B3 thymomas. A comparative study of Glut-1 expression in atypical versus conventional type A thymomas appears warranted.

The tissue micro array contained 80 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma, and 80 cases of invasive lobular carcinoma. Each case was scored as positive or negative for nuclear expression of EBNA1 in tumor cells using standard light microscopy.EBNA1 staining was evident in the tumor cells of 63 cases (39.4% of tumor cases). By tumor type (ductal/lobular) EBV infection was noted in 34 (42.5%) cases of invasive ductal carcinoma and 29 (36.2%) cases of invasive lobular carcinoma, this difference was not found to be significant (P\u00a0=\u00a00.518).This study indicates that EBV infection is equally distributed across the ductal and lobular tumor types.",

PEL is universally associated with human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) infection and has an aggressive prognosis. Recently, an HHV-8-unrelated PEL-like lymphoma that usually occurs in elderly individuals and follows a more indolent prognosis has been reported, and it is treated as a disease distinct from PEL. However, its pathogenesis and prognostic factors have not been sufficiently clarified. In PEL-like lymphoma accompanied by Epstein\u2013Barr virus (EBV) infection, latent infection types are not mentioned in the literature. Herein, we report the case of an 85-year-old Japanese man with pericardial PEL-like lymphoma who showed good improvement in condition for 24 months after pericardiocentesis without chemotherapy. Serological test results were positive for EBV capsid antigen and EBV nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2), but negative for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus. The disease phenotype and EBV infection mechanism were immunohistochemically investigated by the cellblock prepared from pericardial effusion. Atypical cells were positive for CD20, CD30, CD45, BCL2, MUM1, EBNA2, latent membrane protein 1, and EBV-encoded RNA (on in situ hybridization), but negative for CD3, CD5, CD10, CD138, cytokeratin AE1/AE3, and HHV-8. Accordingly, this case was considered to be a B-cell activated phenotype with a type III latent EBV infection. Type III latent EBV infection is unusual in PEL.",

A 74-year-old man visited our institution for follow-up of acute pancreatitis. Imaging examinations revealed a hypovascular intraductal mass in the head of the pancreas with progressive dilation of the pancreatic duct, atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma, and a non-mucinous appearance. A pancreatoduodenectomy was performed to identify this pancreatic intraductal neoplasm. Macroscopically, the tumor was a solid nodular mass with no visibly secreted mucin obstructing the dilated ducts. Histologically, it had a homogeneous appearance with nodules of back-to-back tubular glands and occasional papillary elements, and there were no apparent transitions to areas with less marked cytoarchitectural atypia. Although the intraductal neoplastic growth corresponded to an ITPN, immunohistochemical staining revealed partial positivity for MUC5AC, for which ITPNs are characteristically negative. Somatic mutations in KRAS, GNAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA were not detected. A loss of MUC5AC expression and mutations in KRAS and GNAS are key elements in the diagnosis of ITPN. Thus, it was difficult to distinguish the present case as a pancreatobiliary-type (PB-type) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) or a phenotypic variant of ITPN. As it is possible that some cases of PB-type IPMN and ITPN overlap, the precise classification of these rare lesions may require re-evaluation.",

Pigs have been used as models for human diseases because they are similar to humans in terms of their anatomy, physiology and genome. Hence, we analyzed articular cartilage and synovial membrane pathology in miniature Vietnamese pigs after a unilateral partial menisectomy and 20-day exercise regimen to determine if the pigs developed pathological characteristics similar to human OA. Histological and protein expression analysis of articular cartilage from menisectomized pigs revealed the following pathologic changes resembling OA: fibrillation, fissures, chondrocyte cluster formation, decrease in proteoglycan content and upregulation of the OA-associated proteins MMP-3, MMP-13, procaspase-3 and IL-1\u03b2. Moreover, histological analysis of synovial membrane revealed mild synovitis, characterized by hyperplasia, cell infiltration and neoangiogenesis. Pathological changes were not observed in the contralateral joints or the joints of sham-operated pigs. Further studies are required to validate such an OA model; however, our results can encourage the use of pigs to study early stages of OA physiopathology. Based on their similarities to humans, pigs may be useful for preclinical studies to identify new candidate biomarkers and novel treatments for OA.",

Histopathological evaluation of tissue samples was conducted on hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections. PNI was considered positive when cancer cells were observed inside the nerve sheath, or when at least 33% of the nerve periphery was surrounded by cancer cells. A 3-tier grading system (PNI0, PNI1, PNI2) based on the depth of PNI was used to assess the localization of PNI in the bowel. PNI and other prognostic factors were evaluated by survival analysis.PNI status in CRC significantly affected postoperative overall survival (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The five-year survival rates for PNI-negative and PNI-positive patients were 77% and 32%, respectively. PNI was closely correlated with tumor gross type, tumor grade, depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, clinical stage, vessel invasion, tumor budding grade, and tumor growth pattern. Multivariate analysis revealed that PNI was an independent prognostic factor (HR\u00a0=\u00a02.223, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003). The survival of PNI-positive patients was significantly poorer than that of PNI-negative patients in stages II and III (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003 and P\u00a0=\u00a00.008, respectively). The overall survival of colorectal patients was in the descending order of PNI-negative at stage II, PNI-positive at stage II/PNI-negative at stage III, and PNI-positive at stage III (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). When the PNI status and T stage were considered together, overall survival curves of the PNI2 patients were significantly worse than those of PNI1 patients in pT4 stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019).PNI is a poor independent prognostic factor for CRC. It could complement classic TNM staging classification in stratifying CRC patients in stages II and III.

However, in our research IL-6 was of limited utility as a single marker for differential diagnosis of the prostate diseases in small foci needle biopsy by pathologist visual scoring. The standardization of immunohistochemical (IHC) staining protocol for IL-6 is required to determine IL-6 expression in order to avoid possible misinterpretation of the IHC results.",

Animals were divided into two groups with 12 animals each, as follows: group A (uninfected) and group B (infected).

Infected animals showed an increase in AChE activity in whole blood and a decrease in AChE activity in liver homogenates (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) at 20 and 150 days PI. BChE and PK activities were decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in serum and liver homogenates of infected animals at 150 days PI. ADA activity was decreased in serum at 20 and 150 days PI, while in liver homogenates it was only decreased at 150 days PI (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities in serum were increased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while concentrations of total protein and albumin were decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) when compared to control. The histological analysis revealed fibrous perihepatitis and necrosis.

Macroscopic examination revealed a diverticulum-like structure 2.5\u00a0cm in size near the site of mesenteric attachment of the ileum. Histological examination showed diffuse and nodular proliferation of spindle cells positive for c-KIT and CD34 that had replaced the muscularis propria of the small intestine. Mutational analyses of the lesions revealed monoclonality of proliferating cells with a somatic mutation in c-kit exon 11 (p.Leu576Pro).

The condition was first described as a disease of the pancreas, and has since been recognized in various organ systems including the kidneys. IgG4 related kidney disease (IgG4-RKD) signifies any form of renal involvement by IgG4-RD. The most common renal involvement by IgG4-RD is tubulointerstitial nephritis. Glomerular disease, in particular membranous glomerulonephritis, may also be seen. Other co-existent glomerular diseases such as IgA nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and mesangioproliferative immune complex glomerulonephritis may be identified. IgG4-related plasma cell arteritis has also been noted in the kidney. As with IgG4-RD in general, IgG4 related kidney disease (IgG4-RKD) usually occurs in middle-aged to elderly men. Common findings in IgG4-RKD are plasma cell-rich interstitial inflammatory infiltrate either in a focal or diffuse pattern with increased IgG4+ plasma cells, expansile swirling interstitial fibrosis, high levels of serum IgG and IgG4, hypocomplementemia, high serum IgE levels and/or peripheral blood eosinophilia. By immunofluorescence, most of the cases show IgG4 dominant tubular basement membrane immune complex deposits. Similar to IgG4-RD, IgG4-RKD often shows a rapid response to steroid therapy.

A multitude of cytologic features of CMV-PTC are described, which includes hypercellularity, cribriform pattern, papillary arrangement of tall columnar cells, morules, spindle cells, clear and ground-glass nuclei, hyaline material, hemosiderin-laden histiocytes, and absence of colloid in the background. CMV-PTC is histologically characterized by the papillary growth of tall columnar cells, cribriform pattern without colloid, spindle cells, squamoid morules, and nuclear clearing. The immunoreactivity for beta-catenin and biotin-positive nuclear clearing may indicate CMV-PTC. Total thyroidectomy for familial or lobectomy for sporadic cases is usually the treatment for CMV-PTC.

To further investigate the biological function of CCT8 in gliomas, CCT8-silenced U87 glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and U251MG cells were constructed using a small interference RNA (siRNA) sequence. The knockdown effect of CCT8 on proliferation and invasion in these cells was analyzed using the CCK8, flow cytometry cycle, scratch, transwell invasion and fluorescence assays. Compared with the controls, the glioma cells expressing CCT8-siRNA exhibited a significantly decreased proliferation and invasion capacity, as well as a dysregulated cell cytoskeleton. This study showed that high CCT8 protein expression might be related to poor outcome of glioma, and that CCT8 regulates the proliferation and invasion of glioblastomas.",

In this study, we analysed a well-characterised group of soft tissue sarcomas for different tyrosine kinase receptors and correlated the results with clinicopathological parameters, including survival.275 soft tissue sarcomas of our Sarcoma center at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University (LMU) were reinvestigated and categorized according to the current WHO classification system.

It functions as a sequence-specific serine/arginine splicing factor that plays a role in mRNA processing, splicing patterns, and gene expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that TRA2\u03b2 is essential for normal mouse embryonic and brain development and has important roles in some cancers. However, the contribution of TRA2\u03b2 gene dysfunction to the pathology of human diseases, such as gliomas, has not been addressed. This study aimed to assess the expression and function of TRA2\u03b2 in human glioma. To analyze the expression levels of TRA2\u03b2 protein in glioma tissues, we performed immunohistochemical and Western blot analysis on human glioma tissues. The expression level of the TRA2\u03b2 protein was significantly higher in high-grade gliomas than in low-grade gliomas. A strongly positive correlation was observed between TRA2\u03b2 and Ki-67. More importantly, high expression of TRA2\u03b2 was associated with a poor outcome. In vitro, after the release of U87 cell lines from serum starvation, the expression of TRA2\u03b2 was upregulated, as well as PCNA and cyclin A. Knockdown of the TRA2\u03b2 gene resulted in suppression of the cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest during the G0/G1 phase, and a significant inhibition of cell migration. These results suggest that TRA2\u03b2 promotes glioma cell growth and migration, and could be a candidate for molecular targeting during gene therapy treatments of glioma.",

These processes unfolded along with accidental involution of lymphoid organs, which resulted from the failure of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells to differentiate into lymphoid lineage progenitors.Here we compare SPF and non-SPF animals, and demonstrate that the major cause of systemic inflammation and sepsis observed upon such treatments is activation of an opportunistic infection. Mice of the same strain (CBA) housed under SPF conditions do not develop the characteristic symptoms, nor do they become moribund. Yet, regardless of the breeding conditions, upon synergistic action of cyclophosphamide and dsDNA, CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells consistently fail to give rise to lymphoid lineage progenitors.

     "abstract": "The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) have been identified as oncologically important targets. This study aimed to evaluate the immunoexpression of EGFR and EMMPRIN in a series of cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Forty-five cases of HNSCC were selected for this study and evaluated with anti-EGFR and anti-EMMPRIN antibodies. The percentage of positive cells was determined assessing to the following categories: score 1 (staining in 0\u201350% of cells), score 2 (staining in 51\u201375% of cells), and score 3 (staining in >75% of cells). Immunostaining intensity was graded according to the following parameters: score 1 (absent/weak expression) and score 2 (strong expression).For EGFR, a predominance of high median scores was observed in cases of both histological grades of malignancy and in different clinical stages (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). For EMMPRIN, a statistically significant difference was observed between the histological grades of malignancy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.030). Regarding the immunostaining intensity of EMMPRIN, it was observed a predominance of score 1 in cases with stages I/II, whereas most cases with stages III/IV presented score 2 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). Considering the anatomical location, most cases of buccal floor presented higher median score of EMMPRIN in comparison with the other sites (p\u00a0=\u00a00.015).These findings suggest that both proteins are potential targets for cancer therapy and EMMPRIN can be used as a prognostic marker of a more aggressive biological behavior in patients with HNSCC.",

The Chalkley method was used to quantify the microvascular area by neoangiogenesis (CD105) immunomarker in each group.There was no significant difference for rate of p53- and Ki67-positive cells between groups. Significant positive correlation was found between the CD105 microvascular area and the rate of p53 positive cells in superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma as well as between the rate of p53- and Ki67-positive cells in invasive squamous cell carcinoma.p53 and Ki67 immunoexpression did not increase with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma progression. Neovascularization in the initial stage of invasion and proliferative activity in the frankly invasive stage were both associated with p53 immunoexpression.

We identified 28 novel AML- and ALL-related genes shared in both of them using a short path algorithm. By integrating gene ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway annotations, we revealed the underlying molecular features of AML and ALL. We finally obtained 160 optimal GO terms that could satisfactorily distinguish two types. Further analysis revealed that the results agree well with previous knowledge. Determining the common and different features between AML and ALL facilitates the classification of leukemia and is thus clinically relevant for exploring the molecular markers.",

     "abstract": "Acute allograft rejection is initiated by a large number of recipient T cells that recognize donor alloantigens. Apoptotic signals trigger Nur77 production. Nur77 translocates from the nucleus to the mitochondria to induce a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the release of mitochondrial cell-death mediators, including HtrA2/Omi. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Nur77, HtrA2/Omi, and T lymphocyte apoptosis during acute allograft rejection in a rat cardiac transplantation model. The median survival time of the isograft group was longer than that of the allograft group. The cardiac grafts in isogenic (Lewis to Lewis) and allogenic (Wistar to Lewis) models were subjected to HE stain, showing that no rejection occurred in the isografts and that the rejection level was increased in allografts. Compared with the rare expression in syngeneic Lewis rat hearts by western blot analysis, Nur77 protein level in allograft increased from day 1, peaked at day 5 after transplantation, and maintained the highest level until day 7. Double immunofluorescence staining on allograft tissues at day 5 showed Nur77 immunocompetence in most CD3+ cells, and Nur77 positive T cells also showed HtrA2/Omi-positive signal. Meanwhile, active caspase-3 was apparent in these HtrA2/Omi-positive T cells. Immunohistochemical results suggested that both Nur77 and active caspase-3 were expressed in increasing infiltrating lymphocytes. Our results demonstrated that upregulated Nur77 may promote graft-infiltrating T lymphocyte apoptosis by translocating and inducing HtrA2/Omi release from mitochondria in acute rejection after cardiac transplantation.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of the study was to assess the incidence and prognostic role of epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) in squamous cell carcinoma of the penis (SCCP).Sixty tumor specimens of surgically treated SCCP patients characterized by a central histopathologic review were stained with antibodies against E-cadherin, N-cadherin, \u03b2-catenin, and vimentin. Staining profiles were scored by two independent raters, and correlated with pertinent clinical and pathological parameters and cancer-specific mortality (CSM; median follow-up: 34 months, interquartile range: 6\u201360 months).Correlation statistics proved good interobserver agreement in staining evaluation (K-values between 0.62 and 1.00, all p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Based on consensus decision between both raters, 36 study cases (60%) showed a switch from E-cadherin to N-cadherin (as a hallmark of EMT), which correlated with the presence of lymphovascular invasion (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.287, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026) while failing to interfere with CSM. Although cadherin switch was correlated with a loss of membranous \u03b2-catenin expression (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.629, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), none of the study cases showed nuclear \u03b2-catenin expression, and only three EMT cases (8.3%) had tumor buds revealing vimentin expression.Our data suggest that roughly half of surgically treated SCCP cases exhibit EMT, a parameter correlating with lymphovascular invasion. However, further studies are clearly needed to validate the so far unresolved possible role of cadherin switch in terms of predicting nodal spread in patients with SCCP. Moreover, the apparently complex mechanisms driving EMT in SCCP should be explored by future studies, as knowledge about these might provide a so far unexploited basis for the development of novel targeted therapies against SCCP with metastatic dissemination.",

Probes for centromeres 4 and 10 were applied as surrogate markers for the ploidy status. In addition, a dual color FISH probe set for the centromere of chromosome 12 and the KRAS gene was applied to the TMA to analyze numerical alterations and KRAS gene copy numbers. Further we analyzed DNA sequence profiles of KRAS codons 12 and 13 to assess the allele status of the mutation within the tumor samples.KRAS mutation was confirmed in 24 cases, while 28 cases showed a wild-type KRAS status. The majority of cases showed diploid FISH signals for chromosomes 4 and 10. Near triploid FISH signals were observed in only 2 cases, 12 cases were hypodiploid, and 8 cases were hyperdiploid. In 6 cases, trisomy 12 could be ascertained. In total, aneuploidy could be detected in 28 cases, including cases with trisomy 12 and hyposomy 10. Tumors with aneuploid chromosomal content had a worse prognosis compared to euploid tumors, however, without reaching statistical significance (p\u00a0=\u00a00.231). Hypodiploid carcinomas carried the worst prognosis. Specifically, monosomy 10 was significantly associated with reduced survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039). Increased FISH signals of KRAS did not correlate significantly with relapse (p\u00a0=\u00a00.916).FISH analysis can be used as a surrogate marker for the ploidy status.

Peritumoral dendritic cell density >1.1 cells/HPF was inversely associated with the risk of recurrence. Similar results were obtained with tumoral dendritic cell density (>12 cells/HPF), although the statistical significance was marginal.High CD1a-positive dendritic cell density is associated with improved disease-free survival in PTC.

As somatic activating mutations of GNAS are considered to be characteristic of LAMNs while TP53 mutations have been shown to be specific to MACs, MACs are unlikely to result from transformation of LAMNs. However, emerging evidence also shows the presence of GNAS mutations in MACs. We examined 16 AMTs (11 LAMNs and 5 MACs) for genetic alterations of GNAS, KRAS, BRAF, TP53, CTNNB1, and TERT promoter in order to elucidate the possibility of a shared genetic background in the two tumor types. Extensive histological examination revealed the presence of a low-grade component in all cases of MAC. GNAS mutations were detected in two LAMNs and in one MAC, although the GNAS mutation in this MAC was a nonsense mutation (Q227X) expected not to be activating mutation. TP53 mutations were detected in three LAMNs; they were frequently detected in MACs. KRAS mutations were detected in three LAMNs and three MACs, and CTNNB1 mutations were detected in two LAMNs. KRAS mutation and activating mutation of GNAS occurred exclusively in AMTs. BRAF and TERT mutations were not detected. Overexpression of p53 was observed in only two MACs, and p53 immunostaining clearly discriminated the high-grade lesion from a low-grade component in one. These findings suggest that p53 overexpression plays an important role in the carcinogenesis of AMTs and that, in addition to mutations of GNAS, KRAS and TP53 alterations might be shared by AMTs, thus providing evidence for the possible progression of LAMNs to MAC.",

     "abstract": "Therapy of metastatic colorectal carcinoma has greatly evolved in recent years. Surgery is still the best curative option and can improve survival in stage IV disease. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has emerged as a widely used therapeutic option before surgery. Pathologists have developed several systems to grade response, mainly adapting the grading systems used for the response in primary esophageal or rectal tumors. There are many reports confirming the prognostic utility of these grading systems. However, there have been fewer references to the potential significance of the pattern of histological response. The objective of the present study is to describe the histopathological lesions found in the tumor bed after NAC and their potential significance in terms of prognosis.We reviewed the files of patients with colorectal carcinoma that developed hepatic metastasis during follow-up and received NAC before surgical resection of metastasis. We gathered demographic, analytical and morphological data of the cases, and also reviewed the hepatic resection samples to measure the pathological response to chemotherapy according to Blazer's criteria, and to define the predominant patterns of response (mucin pools, fibrosis or necrosis). We also determined the presence of satellitosis, measured the thickness of the tumor-normal interface (TNI) as proposed by Maru et al., and searched for vascular and bile duct invasion. All these pieces of information were collected in an Excel database and analyzed with SPSS 20.0 for Windows statistical package. The outcome measures were disease-free survival and overall survival in months since the first surgery to resect metastatic disease.Fifty patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the present study. All of them had received a chemotherapeutic regimen mainly based on platinum, associated or not with targeted drugs (18% received anti-EGFR drugs and 24% anti-VEGFR drugs). Of the primaries, 66% were of sigmoid-rectal origin, and 32% of the cases showed a major histopathological response to therapy (including 3 cases with a complete response). In 76% of the tumors, the predominant histological pattern was necrosis, followed by fibrosis (57.4%). Mucin pools were the predominant feature in 23.4% of the tumors. We found satellitosis (microscopic tumor nodules separated by more than 1\u00a0mm from the principal tumor) in 53.2% of the cases. A prominent inflammatory reaction was found in 19% of the cases, and it was mainly composed of lymphocytes and hystiocytes (70% of the cases). Vessel invasion was seen in 30% of the cases, and perineural invasion was only found in 4%. We found no case of bile duct invasion by the tumor. The thickness of the TNI measured less than 2.5\u00a0mm in 60% of the present series. Statistical analysis of the series revealed that thickness of the tumor-liver interface was significantly associated with recurrence and overall survival. We found a significant association between response and thickness of the tumor-normal liver interface. In our series, the presence of satellitosis tended to predict a shorter DFS. The comparison of Kaplan\u2013Meier curves with the log-rank test showed a significant association between overall survival and the presence of mucin pools and fibrosis in the tumor bed. The other histopathological factors did not predict differences in prognosis. These differences were independent of the use of targeted drugs.The pathological reports of hepatic metastasis from colorectal carcinoma resected after NAC usually indicate only the number, the size and the response of the tumor cells to therapy, apart from the distance to the resection margin of the specimen. Few reports have analyzed the possible prognostic significance of the different kinds of histopathological responses. The results of the present study indicate that those tumors with extensive pools of mucin show a significantly worse prognosis as compared to tumors with less mucin secretion. Fibrosis indicates a better prognosis, except when desmoplasia is present. Our study further supports the prognostic significance of the thickness of the tumor-hepatic interface. We conclude that pathology reports should specify the kind of histopathological response to therapy, besides grading it, because this might add significant prognostic information.",

With this purpose, thirty-three (33) serum samples from female dogs with histopathological diagnosis of mammary carcinoma, without evidence of metastasis, were used (group B). The material was classified based on the degree of malignancy, as follows: subgroup B1 (low-grade malignancy; n\u00a0=\u00a026) and subgroup B2 (high grade of malignancy; n\u00a0=\u00a07). Serum samples from healthy females (group A; n\u00a0=\u00a010) were used as negative control. Our results showed that levels of cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, INF-\u03b3, IL-1, and IL-6), NOx (nitrite/nitrate), AOPP (protein oxidation), and FRAP (antioxidant power) were significantly (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) increased in dogs with mammary carcinoma (group B), when compared with group A. On the other hand, ADA activity was significantly decreased (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in both subgroups B1 and B2, when compared with group A.

Unlike other variables, NO, AOPP, and IFN-\u03b3 were influenced by the degree of tumor malignancy, i.e., their levels were even higher in subgroup B2. Therefore, based on these results, we can conclude that all variables investigated are related to the pathogenesis of this disease, since they were altered in dogs with mammary tumor. Additionally, we suggest that ADA activity had an anti-inflammatory effect on these tumor samples, probably in order to modulate the inflammatory response.",

Here we describe a case of a 74-year-old man who underwent radiological investigations for a transient episode of blurred vision. Based on the clinical and endocrinological findings and MRI results, the patient was assumed to have a clinically non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma, which was followed-up over a 2-year period. He did not have any endocrine symptoms or progressive visual deterioration, and no history of past malignancy, including melanoma. Endocrinological investigation was unremarkable; blood hormone levels were within the normal ranges except for low serum total testosterone and bioavailable testosterone levels without symptoms of hypogonadism. The longitudinal MRI follow-up demonstrated a gradual increase in the size of the tumor over the course of 11 months. For this reason, the patient underwent surgery. Pathologic examination including histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy achieved the correct diagnosis of melanocytic tumor of the sellar region morphologic examination is essential in the diagnosis of melanocytic tumors. Hmb-45 is an important diagnostic biomarker in melanocytic lesions. The use and exploration of miRNA, Ki67 and osteopontin are important in understanding the genesis, progression, and prognosis in treatment of patients with melanocytic tumors.",

Histologically they are composed of epithelioid or oval-to spindle cells with a sheet-like or nested pattern of growth, strongly positive for neural markers (S-100, SOX10, and vimentin) and negative for the melanocytic ones. EWSR1 gene rearrangements including EWSR1-ATF1 or EWSR1-CREB1 GENE fusions are typically assessed in these tumors.

In the past decade, a developmental program epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been increasingly recognized to play pivotal and intricate roles in promoting carcinoma invasion and metastasis. The EMT process is very complex and controlled by various families of transcriptional regulators through different signaling pathways. In this system review, we focus on the molecular network of the EMT program and its malignant phenotypes associated with metastasis in colorectal cancer (CRC), including cancer stem cells, tumor budding, circulating tumor cells and drug resistance. A better understanding of the molecular regulation of the dynamic EMT program during tumor metastasis will help to provide much-needed therapeutic interventions to target this program when treating metastatic CRC.",

A tumor-bearing nude mice model was established by subcutaneous injection of human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Two weeks later, the mice were randomly divided into four groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06 for each group): negative control group, rhEPO group, EPO antibody group and EPO\u00a0+\u00a0EPO antibody group. Drugs were administered to the corresponding mice once every 3 days for five times. The size and weight of tumors were measured after the mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. The expression levels of EPO/EPOR, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, and Bcl-2 in the tumor tissues were determined using RT-PCR and Western blot. The microvessel density (MVD) and expression of VEGF in the tumors were detected using immunohistochemistry. TUNEL assay was used to determine apoptosis in tumors. Results show that rhEPO significantly promoted the growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in nude mice (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared with the negative control group, the expression levels of EPO, EPOR, TNF-\u03b1, IL-10, and VEGF, as well as the MVD values, were significantly elevated in the rhEPO group. However, the apoptotic index was significantly reduced (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

The investigation of subcellular localization of GKN1 in gastric cancer cells can provide insights into its potential cellular roles. Subcellular fractions of gastric cancer cells (AGS) transfected with full-length GKN1 (flGKN1) or incubated with recombinant GKN1 (rGKN1) lacking the first 20 amino acids at N-terminal were analyzed by Western blot and confocal microscopy and compared with those from normal gastric tissue. Wild type GKN1 (wtGKN1) and flGKN1 were revealed in the cytoplasm and in the membrane fractions of gastric cells, whereas rGKN1 was revealed in the cytoplasmic fractions, but a high amount was detected in the membrane pellet of the AGS lysate. The cellular distribution of GKN1 was also confirmed by confocal microscopy. The purified protein was also used to highlight its possible association with actin through confocal microscopy, pelleting assay, and size-exclusion chromatography. GKN1 co-localizes with actin in normal gastric tissue, but no direct interaction was observed between the two proteins in vitro. Most likely, GKN1 indirectly participates in actin stabilization since its overexpression in gastric cancer cells strongly increases the expression of tight and adherens junction proteins.",

Molecular testing of the tumors in all 4 cases identified two separate genetic profiles, favored to represent tumors arising from donor tissues along with infiltrating recipient lymphocytes.Previous reports suggested that epithelial malignancies in allograft kidneys are rare. We identified 4 such tumors in 1584 transplant patients. Further, we identified the first reported case of translocation RCC in an allograft kidney.

The frequency of SRCs and immunohistochemistry expression of MUC1/MUC2/MUC5AC/MUC6 were evaluated.We confirmed that SRC differentiation can occur in different histological types, including ductal, lobular, mucinous and metaplastic carcinomas. The proportion of SRCs was highly variable (range: 8\u201370%). Tumors encompassed SRCs of intracytoplasmic lumina and goblet-cell type. A higher percentage of SRCs was associated with lymphovascular invasion (p\u00a0=\u00a00.047). All tumors expressed cytoplasmic and membranous MUC1. Secretory mucins were more frequent in mucinous carcinomas and in carcinomas with extensive SRC differentiation.We conclude that besides the usefulness of mucin immunodetection for the differential diagnosis of carcinomas with SRC differentiation of breast origin, it is important to report SRC differentiation regardless of histological type because of its intrinsic prognostic value.",

Furthermore, mutation analysis for KRAS exon 2 and BRAF exon 15 was performed.The expression of nuclear \u03b2-catenin, CD44 and CD133 was associated with the development of liver metastasis, but not of CNS metastasis. CD133 expression was absent in CRC with solitary CNS metastasis. Combination of cancer stem cell markers revealed high discriminatory power for the prediction of different patterns of distant spread. KRAS mutation was more frequently detected in patients with CNS metastasis, but the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF failed to show correlation with clinico-pathological data or the results of immunohistochemistry.This study demonstrates that deregulation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin-signaling and high-grade expression of cancer stem cell markers correlate with metastasis to the liver, but not to the CNS.

Invasive urothelial carcinoma (UC) exhibiting positive CK5/CD44 staining was designated as basal-like UC (BUC).In this study, of 251 invasive UC (pT1 in 57% and pT2-4 in 43%), BUC accounted for 40% of cases (accounting for most pT2-4 UC) and often presented as non-papillary UC without previous history of UC. In addition, BUC exhibited uniform nuclei with lesser degree of atypia than non BUC and decreased or negative cytokeratin 20 reactivity. Nested and microcystic variants of UC immunohistochemically stained as BUCs. Invasive non-BUCs were often papillary with marked cytologic atypia and pleomorphism, and accounted for most pT1 UC. The rates of perivesical invasion, lymph node and distant metastases were higher for BUC than non-BUC. All nine cases with absent/minimal residual in situ UC in 102 radical cystectomy specimens were from invasive non-BUC.BUC is distinguished from non-BUC due to this aggressive behavior, distinct immunohistochemical profile, and predominant non-papillary architecture. Our findings are consistent with recent studies identifying a subtype of muscle-invasive UC with molecular expression of basal cell and luminal cell molecular profiles. Our study further supports categorizing invasive UCs into these subtypes with different biological behaviors, possibly contributing to better therapeutic strategies.",

     "abstract": "Hemangioblastomas are rare capillary-rich tumors predominantly found in the CNS. The histological appearance of these tumors varies across a broad spectrum. Several entities show considerable histomorphological similarities to hemangioblastomas. Therefore, morphological evaluation can be challenging. In this study, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of immunohistochemistry using antibodies against carbonic anhydrase IX and cytokeratin staining. Within our files, we identified 20 hemangioblastomas. A collection of 46 other tumors relevant to the differential diagnosis (12 pilocytic astrocytomas, 11 meningiomas, one pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, one angiomatous fibrous histiocytoma, 14 carcinoma metastases and seven gliomas grades II\u2013IX) served as control. The pattern of strong, diffuse expression of carbonic anhydrase IX with membranous accentuation in combination with keratin negativity was considered diagnostic for hemangioblastomas. It was found in 18 out of 20 (90%) hemangioblastomas and in none of the control cases (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). This resulted in a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 100%. The positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 96%, respectively. Carbonic anhydrase IX with cytokeratin is thus a highly sensitive and specific marker combination for hemangioblastomas. It is therefore very helpful in the diagnosis of these tumors and in their discrimination from other entities.",

     "abstract": "Melanoma is one of the aggressive cancer types causing the majority of deaths in skin cancer patients. Mutational screening of the tumor revealed a number of driver mutations in oncogenes which enabled melanoma classification into a few molecular subtypes. BRAF is a key component of mitogen-activated kinase pathway; its activating mutation leads to accelerated melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and survival. Somatic mutations in BRAF were reported in various malignancies, including thyroid cancer, colorectal cancer and melanoma. Specific features of BRAF-positive tumors could have clinical implications as mutational alterations may have an impact on the biological behavior of the tumor and prognosis of the disease.In the present study, the frequency of BRAF V600E mutation was evaluated in Russian patients with melanocytic lesions, of which 41.25% were primary melanoma and 60% were melanocytic nevi. Melanoma patients with trunk localization were of younger age in the BRAF-positive group as compared with BRAF-negative patients. Immunohistochemical evaluations of Ki-67 expression, as well as matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9, were found to be equal in BRAF-positive and BRAF-negative tumors. MMP-2/MMP-9 immunoreactivity was observed in stromal and/or melanocytic cells both in melanoma and nevi patients. Besides tumor cells, MMP-9 expression was observed in lymphocytes in 27.2% of BRAF-positive and in 19.1% of BRAF-negative patients. Histopathological prognostic markers (Breslow thickness, mitotic index, ulceration, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes pattern) did not show any differences depending on BRAF V600E mutational status.The frequency of BRAF-positive melanomas in Russian cohort is similar to other Caucasian population rates. BRAF V600E mutation harboring tumors are more often observed in younger patients without specific features of morphological prognostic factors.",

We reviewed a series of 50 PG and 23 Ks located on distal extremities with the aid of an immunohistochemical panel comprising CD34, CD31, FVIII, SMA, D2-40, HHV8.After revision, 6/50 PG lesions previously diagnosed as PG, showed positive immunostaining for LNA1-HHV8 and focal positivity for CD31 and FVIII in the endothelial cells of the proliferating vessels, with some SMA positive pericytes. D2-40, a marker of lymphatic endothelium positive in KS, stained negatively. These lesions were renamed PGLKS. Of note, in our series, PGLKS represented the only form of KS localized in the hand; all the patients were HIV-negative, older than PG patients, with a prevalence for male gender.PGLKS and PG need a different management and a follow-up is advisable for PGLKS, as for the other variants of KS. To date, D2-40 negative immunostaining has not yet been reported in PGLKS and should not lead to a misdiagnosis of PG. The morphological similarities with PG and the immunohistochemical findings, showing a defective phenotype of the neoplastic cells, suggest a histogenetic hypothesis in which D2-40 negative PGLKS could represent an early stage of HHV8 infection of a pre-existing PG, whose vessels loose progressively their blood vascular markers but have not still acquired the lymphatic ones.",

Previously, we demonstrated that LAT1 is highly expressed in advanced gastric carcinoma with lymph node metastasis, and proposed that LAT1 is an independent prognostic factor in non-scirrhous gastric carcinoma. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between LAT1 expression and the size of lymph node metastatic lesions in gastric carcinoma. LAT1 and Ki-67 expression was immunohistochemically analyzed in 64 cases of advanced gastric carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. LAT1 expression in the metastatic lymph nodes was correlated with that in the primary lesions. The high LAT1 expression group showed a larger size of metastatic lesion and a higher Ki-67 labeling index than the low LAT1 expression group. LAT1 expression had a weak association with Ki-67 labeling index and tumor diameter of lymph nodes. These results suggest that LAT1 expression is associated with disease progression in gastric carcinoma.

     "abstract": "Malignant tumors of the lung are predominantly derived from epithelial tissue, such as squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, while pulmonary lymphatic and hematopoietic tumor is relatively rare. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), nasal type, originates in nasal and extra-nasal sites anatomically. This distinct non-Hodgkin lymphoma is endemic and is characterized by a highly aggressive clinical course and dismal survival outcome. Extra-nasal ENKTL, especially pulmonary ENKTL, is rare compared with nasal type ENKTL and has received relatively little attention. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the clinicopathological features of pulmonary ENKTL and to promote awareness of this malignancy.All cases of ENKTL, nasal type diagnosed from January 2008 to June 2014 in our institution were collected, and those with pulmonary involvement were selected for further study. The eligible cases were analyzed retrospectively: medical recordings, imaging manifestations, pathological features, immunophenotypes, EBER1/2 hybridizations in situ and other related literatures were reviewed.A total of 1105 cases were diagnosed as ENKTL, nasal type, in this period, and 8 cases (7.2\u2030) had lung involvement. Seven cases had core biopsy, and for 1 case, a resected tissue specimen was available. The group was composed of 6 men and 2 women (gender ratio 3:1) with ages ranging from 19 to 44 (average age of 33.5) years. In this group, 2 cases were secondary and 5 cases were primary. The clinical symptoms and computed tomography (CT) manifestations were nonspecific. Histologically, the neoplasms presented angiocentric and angiodestructive growth patterns with different degrees of inflammatory response and necrosis. The neoplastic cell sizes were heterogeneous with spectra of small to large or mixed-composition types. For the immunophenotypes, all cases were positive for CD3\u025b and cytotoxic granule (granzyme B or TIA-1). The positive ratios of CD56 and CD30 were 6/8 and 4/5 respectively. All 8 cases showed positive in situ hybridization for Epstein\u2013Barr virus-encoded small RNA (EBER). TCR-\u03b3 gene rearrangement was tested in 4 cases, and only 1 of these cases was monoclonal. Laboratory testing demonstrated that the whole blood was decreased while the average level of LDH was elevated. Six bone marrow biopsy specimens were negative and showed no neoplastic cells infiltration. For treatment, 4 individuals accepted chemotherapy and 1 patient underwent localized tumor resection surgery. The follow-up information was available for 6 patients, 1 of whom was alive and the other 5 cases survived shortly between 20 days and 4 months. ENKTL, nasal type of lung is very rare, and the diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific clinical symptoms and imaging results. The diagnosis of pulmonary ENKTL should be based on comprehensive clinical, imaging, histopathological and molecular examination. More effective treatment strategies are required for this disease.",

We used the 2013 American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists (ASCO/CAP) scoring criteria to evaluate HER2 amplification status in 175 cases of breast carcinoma with chromosome 17 polysomy. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to determine the HER2 amplification status, and 2-color FISH to detect CEP17, and reviewed the results of initial evaluation using the 2007 ASCO/CAP criteria. Of the 175 cases, 17, 95, and 63 were IHC 0/1+, 2+, and 3+, respectively. Evaluation of IHC HER2 status according to the 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria identified significantly more HER2-positive cases compared to cases evaluated using the 2007 criteria (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). When the FISH results were evaluated in parallel with the 2013 criteria, we found that 22 cases were not HER2-negative despite the presence of polysomy 17, which, according to the 2013 criteria, indicates HER2-positive status. Our findings indicate that in breast carcinoma, HER2 status in the presence of polysomy 17 may vary with the scoring criteria used. In turn, performing FISH and evaluating samples using the 2013 ASCO/CAP criteria means that more patients with breast cancer may be appropriate for targeted treatment with trastuzumab, potentially improving their outcome.",

This study investigated the effects of nimesulide, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, on apoptosis and on the JAK/STAT signaling pathway in Eca-109 human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells. The effects and mechanisms of nimesulide on Eca-109 cell growth were studied in culture and in nude mice with Eca-109 xenografts. Cells were cultured with or without nimesulide and/or the JAK2 inhibitor AG490. Cell proliferation was evaluated using the MTT assay, and apoptosis was investigated. COX-2 mRNA expression was measured using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and protein expression was detected by Western blot analysis, immunohistochemistry, and flow cytometry. Nimesulide significantly inhibited Eca-109 cell viability in vitro in a dose- and time-dependent manner (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Nimesulide also induced apoptosis, which was accompanied by a significant decrease in the expression of COX-2 and survivin and an increase in caspase-3 expression. Nimesulide downregulated the phosphorylation levels of JAK2 and STAT3, and JAK2 inhibition by AG490 significantly augmented both nimesulide-induced apoptosis and the downregulation of COX-2 and survivin (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In vivo, nimesulide inhibited the growth of Eca-109 tumors and the expression of p-JAK2 and p-STAT3. Thus, nimesulide downregulates COX-2 and survivin expression and upregulates caspase-3 expression in Eca-109 cells, by inactivating the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. These effects may mediate nimesulide-induced apoptosis and growth inhibition in Eca-109 cells in vitro and in vivo.",

We used immunofluorescence and Western blot to study the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 in the articular cartilage of normal (N), sham-operated (S), and menisectomized (OA) rats subjected or not to high-impact exercise (E) for 3, 6, and 10 days (N, NE, S, SE, and OA groups). Cartilage integrity and proteoglycan content were only affected in the OA groups. Exercise increased the amount of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 positive chondrocytes in NE and SE groups compared with non-exercised groups (N and S). The expression of IL-1\u03b2 was up-regulated over time in the NE and OA groups, although in the late stages the increase was higher in the OA groups. In contrast, the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was low in the OA group, whereas in the NE groups expression levels were higher at each time point analyzed. These results suggest that anti- and pro-inflammatory molecules in the cartilage might be tightly regulated to maintain the integrity of the tissue and that when this equilibrium is broken (when the meniscus is removed), the pro-inflammatory cytokines take over and OA develops.",

     "abstract": "Infiltrating angiolipoma and osteolipoma of the hand are rare. A 40-year-old man presented with slowly enlarging swelling of his right hand for two and half years without functional deficit but it became painful with slight limitation of movement for the past few months. Plain radiograph showed a large soft tissue swelling with specks of calcifications. Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed an infiltrative mass in the right palm deep to the flexor tendons. As biopsy suggested infiltrative angiolipoma of skeletal muscle, debulking of the tumor was performed. The tumor showed coexistence of all four mesenchymal elements, fat, blood vessel, smooth muscle and bone in various combinations in the form of angiolipomatous, osteolipomatous, ossified intramuscular hemangiomatous, myolipomatous and angiomyolipomatous patterns throughout the entire tumor. Small meningothelial-like whorls of spindle cells were focally seen, some showed intramembranous ossification forming small woven bony spicules in their centers. There were no atypical cells or lipoblasts. Staining for CDK4, MDM2, p16, HMB45 and Melan A was negative. The diagnosis was \u201cinfiltrating hybrid mesenchymal tumor of skeletal muscle showing lipomatous, hemangiomatous, leiomyomatous and osseous features\u201d. The fairly even admixture of the various components supports the neoplastic participation of each individual element. Hybrid mesenchymal tumor most probably originates from multipotent neoplastic cells showing multidirectional differentiation.",

Additionally, previous studies have suggested higher rates of both malignancy and false negative fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) associated with increasing nodule size. This study aims to determine the accuracy of ultrasound (US)-guided FNA using the current Bethesda criteria in surgical practice. We also aimed to investigate the relationship between nodule size and malignancy.A retrospective analysis of US-guided FNAs by a single surgeon during a 4.5 year period. FNA results using Bethesda criteria were compared to final surgical pathology.611 patients with thyroid nodules underwent US-guided FNA. FNA results in 375 subsequently excised thyroid nodules were recorded according to the Bethesda criteria: 192 (51%) benign, 65 (17%) atypia of unknown significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS), 42 (11%), suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFN), 17 (5%) suspicious for malignancy (SM), 28 (8%) malignancy, and 31 (8%) non-diagnostic. Malignancy was confirmed by surgical pathology in 15%, 34%, 50%, 88%, 100%, and 39% of the above groups respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and false-negative rate were 61%, 99%, and 15% respectively. No correlation existed between the size of nodules with indeterminate FNA results and malignancy rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.89), or size of nodules with non-diagnostic FNA and malignancy rate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.50).The current Bethesda risk stratification system underestimated malignancy rates in benign, indeterminate and non-diagnostic cytopathologic categories in our experience. There was no positive linear correlation between nodule size and malignancy rate in these cytopathologic categories.",

We examined the HER2 and KRAS alteration status in eyelid SCs and compared it with that in other eyelid tumors. The controversial topics of the human papillomavirus (HPV) and p16 expression were also investigated. HER2 amplification was determined by silver in situ hybridization, while immunohistochemistry was performed to study protein expressions in 14 SCs and controls, including 23 other eyelid malignancies and 14 benign tumors. Peptide nucleic acid-mediated PCR clamping and direct sequencing were used to detect KRAS mutations. HER2 protein overexpression was observed in 85.7% (12/14) of the SCs, of which two-thirds showed HER2 gene amplification. HER2 protein overexpression and HER2 amplification were found more frequently in eyelid SCs than in other eyelid tumors. All SCs harbored wild type KRAS genes. No HPV infections were identified in the SCs. Nevertheless, p16 overexpression was found in 71.4% (10/14) of SCs, irrespective of the status of HPV infection. Furthermore, p16 overexpression in eyelid SCs was also significantly higher than that in other eyelid tumors. HER2 protein overexpression, HER2 gene amplifications, and wild type KRAS genes are common in eyelid SCs. HER2 gene amplification may represent potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of eyelid SCs.",

It is important to determine those with the potential to act aggressively such as cases with melanocytic differentiation at the time of diagnosis.A total of 46 MTC cases diagnosed at four different centers between 2002 and 2013 were included in the study. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with Melan-A and HMB-45 was performed in all cases.Six of the 46 MTC cases were medullary microcarcinomas and three were multicentric medullary carcinomas. There were 34 females and 12 males with a mean age at onset of 51.4 years and mean tumor diameter of 23.2\u00a0mm. Lymph node metastasis (LNM) was found in 13 of the 38 cases that had data regarding the lymph nodes. Immunohistochemically, Melan A staining was seen in four cases. HMB45 staining was seen in four cases. A statistically significant relationship was found between LNM and diameter, Melan A expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 respectively) but there was no significant relationship with HMB45 expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07). General survival data were present for 35 of the 46 cases. All cases without lymph node metastasis survived (21/21) while 8 of 11 cases with lymph node metastasis survived among cases with survival data; one case that was diffuse-strong positive for both HMB45 and Melan A was lost due to distant organ metastasis six months after the diagnosis.Should the possibility of melanocytic differentiation be evaluated in cases where melanocytic differentiation is not reflected in the morphology (lack of pigment) in MTCs? We did not come across a study on the subject in the English literature. The effect of melanocytic differentiation on the prognosis in MTCs should be investigated in larger series.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small endogenous non-coding RNAs, regulate the expression of genes that play roles in human body via posttranscriptional inhibition. To identify the miRNAs and their target genes involved in obesity, we downloaded the miRNA and gene expression profiles from gene expression omnibus (GEO) database and analyzed the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in adipose tissues from obese subjects compared to those from non-obese subjects. Then, we constructed the miRNA-target interaction network and conducted functional enrichment analysis of DEGs, and the targets negatively correlated with DEMs. We identified a total of 16 miRNAs and 192 genes that showed a significantly different expression and 3002 miRNA-target interaction pairs, including 182 regulatory pairs in obesity. Target genes of DEMs were found mainly enriched in several functions, such as collagen fibril organization, extracellular matrix part, and extracellular matrix structural constituent. Moreover, hsa-miR-425 and hsa-miR-126 had a significant number of target genes and hsa-miR-16/COL12A1 and hsa-miR-634/SLC4A4 interaction pairs are significantly co-expressed, suggesting that they might play important roles in the pathogenesis of obesity.

     "abstract": "The term spina bifida refers to a group of neural tube defects that result in malformations of the spinal cord and the surrounding vertebrae. Though the etiologies of spina bifida remain largely unknown, several risk factors have been identified, including feto-maternal characteristics.To discover possible underlying reasons for the increase of spina bifida and identify intervention targets, an investigation was undertaken comparing spina bifida-affected pregnancy notifications in 2008\u20132011 with notifications in the period 1991\u20131994.Characteristics and outcomes of births with spina bifida and pregnancy characteristics of mothers were recorded in the medical chart. Comparisons of pregnancies affected by a spina bifida in 2008\u20132011 were made with pregnancies affected by a spina bifida in the period 1991\u20131994. Statistical analysis was undertaken using Poisson regression and Chi-squared tests.From 1991 through 1994, the prevalence of identified spina bifida cases was equal to 0.3/10,000 births compared to 1.6/10,000 births in 2008\u20132011. This increase was statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The prevalence of females was equal to 0.45 per 10,000 births over the period 1991\u20131994 compared to 1.88 per 10,000 births during the period 2008\u20132011. As for males, the prevalence was equal to 0.16 per 10,000 births in 1991\u20131994 compared to 1.88 in 2008\u20132011. The difference was statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) between both genders.

As well as, maternal blood type was a significant risk factor for the appearance of spina bifida (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Results also had shown that fetal weight and term, gestity and parity were significant risk factors for the occurrence of spina bifida (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05).In this study, results have been interpreted with caution due to analyses not being adjusted.This analysis highlighted areas where prevention efforts should be strengthened and surveillance data improved.",

In pattern analysis major difference was detected in reporting medium sized, regular cribriform glands. In both group this pattern was reported as Gleason Pattern (GP) 3 by at least 50% of the repliers, the rest reported this pattern as GP 4. Gleason Score (GS) 2\u20134 was not reported by the WG.

The frequency of NN nevi has increased since the introduction of sentinel lymph node mapping as a routine prognostic procedure in breast cancer and melanoma.The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency and morphological findings of NN, to discuss possible pathogenetic pathways in their evolution, and to verify the consistency of p16 immunostaining in the critical differential approach between NN and melanoma metastases.We therefore morphologically and immunohistochemically evaluated a series of 60 NN from 58 patients. In 21 patients, the lymph nodes had been removed during the staging for a skin melanoma; in all these patients NN immunostaining with p16 was strongly positive and p16 proved to be a reliable marker for the crucial differential diagnosis between NN and melanoma metastasis, strongly reacting in NN and lacking in melanoma deposits.A deeper knowledge on NN could help to clarify some important topics such as lymph node metastatic melanoma with unknown primary and the current debate on the lymph node involvement from atypical spitzoid tumors.",

Low FoxJ2 expression was observed in 80 samples and its level was correlated with the grade of malignancy. A strongly positive correlation was observed between FoxJ2 and E-cadherin. Overexpression of FoxJ2 increased E-cadherin expression and decreased vimentin expression. The wound healing and transwell assays showed that overexpression of FoxJ2 significantly inhibited their migration in U87 cells. Consistent with this, knockdown of FoxJ2 promoted cellular motility. In a word, FoxJ2 suppressed cell migration and invasion in glioma, which might be a potential novel molecular targeted therapy for surgery and immune treatment.",

An 18-year-old man suffered from pathological fracture of his right femur after an impact which was preceded by a similar episode two weeks previously. Plain radiograph revealed a displaced fracture in the superior diaphysis of the right femur where an expansile osteolytic lesion with relatively well defined borders was seen. Histologic examination of the curetted lesion showed a well circumscribed spindle cell neoplasm displaying predominantly storiform but focally whorled patterns. In areas, the cells possessed thin wavy spindle nuclei and delicate elongated bipolar cytoplasmic processes supported in a fibromyxoid stroma. They stained positively for EMA, claudin, CD34, collagen 4 and focally for S100 but negatively for MUC4 and BCL-2, indicative of perineurial differentiation. Situated in the periphery of some of these perineurial whorls are spindle cells bearing plump tapering wavy nuclei and palely eosinophilic cytoplasm with indistinct cell borders. They stained intensely for S100 but negatively for EMA, claudin, CD34, collagen 4, MUC4 and BCL-2, consistent with schwannian differentiation. Focally, these two varieties of cells intimately intermingled with each other. Features of aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) formation were present but no mitotic figures, establishing the final diagnosis of primary intraosseous HNST with secondary ABC formation.

They were positive for endothelial markers, such as ERG, Fli1 and CD31. They were also positive for nuclear and cytoplasmic FOSB which are not expressed in epithelioid hemangioendothelioma or epithelioid sarcoma. These pathological and immunohistochemical findings strongly suggested pseudomyogenic hemangioendothelioma/epithelioid sarcoma-like hemangioendothelioma (PHE/ES-HE). Since a recent report directly proved that two cases of PHE/ES-HE have SERPINE1-FOSB fusion gene by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), we examined whether the fusion gene is present or not in the present case by RT-PCR using fresh frozen surgical material. Sequencing of the PCR product revealed that this case has SERPINE1-FOSB fusion. The fusion pattern of our case was different from those of two previously reported cases. In our case, 86 nucleotides of SERPINE1 intron 1 were inserted between SERPINE1 exon 1 and the middle portion of FOSB exon 1, and a putative translation start codon was identified in SERPINE1 intron 1.

Smad4 is an important downstream mediator of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) signaling pathway. Smad4 is regarded as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer, but its role in lymphangiogenesis in colorectal cancer is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the potential inhibiting effect of Smad4 in lymphangiogenesis, and its correlation with VEGF-C secretion in colon cancer. We investigated endogenous Smad4 expression in 7 human colorectal cancer cell lines, and found that six of colon cancer cell lines existed with loss of Smad4. Expression of Smad4 in SW480 cell line is extremely low. SW480 cells were used to establish a Smad4 over-expression model. We investigated the relationship between Smad4 and VEGF-C expression in SW480 cells and found that Smad4 can inhibit the expression of VEGF-C. In an in vitro assay, we found that overexpression of Smad4 can reduce migration and invasion ability in SW480 cells, but had no effect on cell proliferation. Interestingly, Smad4 definitely inhibited the growth in an in vivo assay, and the volumes of transplanted tumors which originated from Smad4 overexpressing SW480 cells in nude mice were smaller than those of normal SW480 cells. In addition, we also demonstrated that Smad4 can inhibit lymphangiogenesis in vivo by immunohistochemistry.

Also, overexpression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis protein, is associated with increased risk of cancers. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between two polymorphisms in the adiponectin gene and endometrial cancer (EC) risk. We also investigated whether epistasis between surviving and adiponectin gene polymorphisms are associated with EC risk in an Iranian population.The samples comprised formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections obtained from the archive of the pathology department, Imam-Khomeini Hospital and Firouzgar hospital. After DNA extraction the genotyping was performed using PCR-RFLP technique.Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in adiponectin (rs1063539, rs2241766) and survivin (rs9904341) gene were evaluated in the study. The increased frequency of ADIPOQ rs1063539C allele (CC\u00a0+\u00a0CG genotype) was associated with decreased EC risk [OR: 0.39(0.17\u20130.90)]. Survivin rs9904341C allele (CC\u00a0+\u00a0CG genotype) was associated with increased EC risk [crude OR: 2.75(1.27\u20135.95), adjusted OR: 2.93(1.27\u20136.76)]. We observed an epistatic interaction between survivin rs9904341 CC\u00a0+\u00a0CG genotype and ADIPOQ rs1063539 GG genotype increasing the risk of EC compared to those with other genotypes [OR: 4.86(1.88\u201312.54), P\u00a0=\u00a00.001].Our findings indicate that adiponectin might have a modulatory effect on survivin role and function in EC, which requires further investigation.",

This study assessed the expression of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1) in gastric cancer and its correlation with clinicopathological parameters and patient survival. Tissue microarray blocks were generated from 179 gastric carcinomas and immunohistochemically stained for p-4E-BP1. The expression of p-4E-BP1 was higher in tumors that were intestinal-type (P\u00a0=\u00a00.028); had a diameter smaller than 5\u00a0cm (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001); were lower pathological T stage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), N stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), or TNM stage (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001); did not have distant metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.027).

Our results indicate that p-4E-BP1 is more highly expressed in early gastric cancers than in advanced ones, and has limited potential as an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with gastric cancer.

Several studies showed that Beclin-1 expression is associated with several prognostic factors of gastric carcinomas. Recently, the connection between autophagy and the hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway has been studied. Here, we investigated the relationship between the autophagy and hedgehog (HH) signaling pathways in gastric adenocarcinoma. We evaluated Beclin-1 and Gli2 expression in 108 gastric adenocarcinoma tissues via immunohistochemical analysis, using a tissue microarray, in relation to survival and other prognostic factors. Our results show that increased Beclin-1 expression is correlated with favorable clinicopathological variables including histologic grade, tumor size, primary tumor (T) stage, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, neural invasion, and tumor recurrence. Furthermore, increased Gli-2 expression was correlated with several favorable clinicopathological variables including primary tumor (T) stage, lymphatic invasion, and tumor recurrence. Increased Beclin-1 expression was significantly correlated with increased Gli2. Univariate analyses for disease-free survival and overall survival revealed that the higher Beclin-1 and Gli2 expression group had a more favorable prognosis compared with the lower Beclin-1 and Gli2 expression group. Our results suggest that progressively increased Beclin-1 and Gli2 expression contributes to the inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis in gastric adenocarcinoma and Beclin-1 acts as a tumor suppressor by regulating the HH signaling pathway through Gli2 expression in gastric adenocarcinoma.",

Immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were used to detect the expression of PTEN and hTERT in 58 cases with HCC and the corresponding paracancerous tissues. The correlation between PTEN and hTERT was analyzed. The PTEN mRNA and protein expression was significantly lower in HCC, as compared with the paracancerous tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), while those of hTERT demonstrated the opposite expression pattern (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Additionally, both the PTEN and hTERT protein and mRNA levels demonstrated a significantly negative correlation with one another (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). In conclusion, PTEN and hTERT have different roles in the development of HCC. A significantly negative correlation between PTEN and hTERT gene expression indicates that hTERT activation and upregulation may be conferred by the loss of PTEN gene expression in HCC. The combined detection of PTEN and hTERT may provide critical clinical evidence for the diagnosis and biological behavior of HCC.",

We aimed to investigate whether immunohistochemistry (HBME-1, cytokeratin-19, galectin-3, CD56 and p63) provides additional information concerning such lesions.We performed an immunohistochemical analysis on 29 TT-UMP cases (22 WDTs-UMP and 7 FTs-UMP) selected from the Rhone Alpes thyroid cancer registry and Departement of Pathology, T\u00eergu-Mure\u015f Emergency County Hospital database.

A continuous cell line named Pt.Kich-1 from a parathyroid carcinoma diagnosed in a patient with secondary hyperparathyroidism (II\u00b0 HPTH) was established and maintained in vitro for more than 60 passages. The cells were characterized for their immunophenotypic and endocrine characteristics as well as for their functional status after treatment by the extracellular [Ca2+]e, and the calcium homeostasis regulator 1\u03b1,25 (OH)2D3. The cytogenetic features were established by the R-banding.The Pt.Kich-1 cultures show an aspect of admixed epithelial/mesenchymal like cells with a doubling time between 96 and 112\u00a0h.

All other laboratory parameters were normal, except for an increased neutrophil alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Reactive neutrophilia due to infection or neoplasia have been ruled out by a total body computerized tomography scan, and by low levels of C reactive protein.

A loose network of reticulin fibers with many intersections was identified by means of Gomori's silver impregnation. There were no hybrid BCR/ABL gene transcripts of p210, p190 and p230, no mutations in platelet derived growth factor receptors alpha and beta. Flow cytometry on the aspirate showed that CD34+ CD117+ myeloblasts constituted less than 1% of total marrow nucleated cells, mature granulocytes demonstrated persistent expression of CD33.

The prediction of tamoxifen resistance by appropriate biomarker analysis and the development of novel therapies for tamoxifen resistance in premenopausal breast cancer is, therefore, an important goal of ongoing research.Tamoxifen resistance is associated with altered estrogen receptor expression especially on the plasma membrane, including the alternative G-protein coupled receptor GPR-30 (GPER) and estrogen receptor splice products, such as ER\u03b136. Tamoxifen resistant cells often use alternative pathways to promote proliferation in the absence of genomic estrogen signaling. These pathways involve the epidermal growth factor EGF, the inflammation associated transcription factor NF-\u03baB- and the IGF-1 pathway.Tamoxifen resistant mamma carcinoma cell lines are useful models to understand tamoxifen resistance in-vitro and to search for prognostic or predictive biomarkers.

The majority of patients were in the age range of 41\u201380 years. 62% of the cases were positive for SP. SP positivity was expressed in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Most of the positive cases were from the tongue region.93% of moderately differentiated, 92% of poorly differentiated and 8% of well-differentiated carcinomas were SP-positive, but SP expression intensity was highest in poorly differentiated cases (+3). More positive patients were males (68.96% of all male patients) with moderately and poorly differentiated OSCC. Among all positive cases, 48% were poorly differentiated, 48% moderately differentiated and 4% well differentiated.Strong expression of SP in poorly and moderately differentiated cases suggests a role of SP in the progression and development of tumor. Expression of SP in the current study increased as the proliferation of cells increased. Prevalence of oral cancer in males may be due to the fact that they smoke and use pan, chewing gum, beetle nut etc. in this region. SP antagonists can help in the reduction and inhibition of oral cancer. SP has a diagnostic value with sensitivity of 92.5% and specificity of 93.7%.

The aim of this study was to investigate the microcosmic changes and tissue damage of fusion regions with various parameters of injury. Ex vivo colons of pigs were fused serosa-serosa on two carrier rings, which were installed on a homemade anastomotic device. Five levels of compressive pressure from 171 to 313\u00a0kPa were applied for 5\u00a0s to fuse the colons under radiofrequency power of 160\u00a0W, and then the collagen denaturation of the fused region was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Light microscopy was utilized to observe histological slices that were stained with picrosirius red in order to visualize the tissue injuries under two levels of radiofrequency power (120 vs. 140\u00a0W) and operation time (5 vs. 10\u00a0s). Transmission electron micrographs showed that increased compressive pressure led to thicker denatured collagen fibrils and wider gaps between each collagen fibril. Serosa adhesion regions appeared abundant in collagen. No histological differences were observed when 120\u00a0W of power was applied for 5 and 10\u00a0s. Significant muscle cracking occurred when colons were fused using 140\u00a0W for 5\u00a0s. When the operation time was extended to 10\u00a0s, 140\u00a0W led to tight fusion and less splitting on muscles. These results suggest that higher compressive pressure results in more severe collagen unfolding and also reduces collagen crosslinking in fused colons. Improved radiofrequency power along with operation time could avoid tissue injury upon radiofrequency-induced colonic anastomoses.",

We screened the medical literature based on keywords search in MEDLINE and EMBASE \u2018Toll-like receptor\u2019, \u2018polymorphism\u2019, and rheumatoid arthritis. Meta-analyses were performed under the random-effects model by using: (1) recessive, (2) homozygous, (3) dominant, (4) codominant and allele contrast models.A total of 3086 cases and 3756 controls in nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. Association between TLR4 Asp299Gly and RA risk was marginally significant [OR\u00a0=\u00a00.856 (95% CI, 0.716\u20131.022); P\u00a0=\u00a00.086] in the homozygous model. AA and GG homozygote genotypes tended to be significant protective factors against RA risk.Our overall analyses indicated that TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism might contribute to RA pathogenesis.",

     "abstract": "The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the thyroid hormones in the gene transcription and immunohistochemical expression of hormonal and angiogenic factors in the placenta of rats. Seventy-two adult female rats were divided equally into propylthiouracil (PTU)-treated, thyroxine (T4)-treated, and control groups. The animals were sacrificed at 10, 14, and 19 days of gestation. We evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of VEGF and its receptor Flk-1. The gene transcription of VEGF, Flk-1, PGF, sFlt1, PL-1, and rPlf was evaluated in placental discs by real-time RT-PCR. The data were analyzed using a Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls (SNK) test. At day 10, T4-treated rats presented increased VEGF and PGF gene expression, while PTU-treated rats showed increased rPlf gene expression. Both groups showed reduced Flk-1 and PL-1 gene expression at day 10. At day 14, PTU-treated rats showed reduced VEGF, PGF, and rPlf gene expression. PTU-treated group showed reduced VEGF immunostaining in the placental labyrinth at 14 and 19 days of gestation but it showed increased VEGF immunostaining in the spongiotrophoblast layer at day 14. PTU-treated rats showed increased Flk-1 expression at 14 days of gestation. At days 14 and 19, T4-treated group showed increased PL-1 gene expression and reduced VEGF immunostaining. T4-treated rats also showed reduced Flk-1 and sFlt-1 expression at day 19. Both groups showed increased rPlf gene expression at day 19. In conclusion, rats treated with PTU and T4 have differential effects on the expression of factors involved in placental angiogenic and hormonal activity, and these effects are dependent on the gestational period.",

In this study, we investigated the prognostic role of VPS4B in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its effect on the growth of HCC cells. Western blot and immunohistochemistrical analyses revealed that VPS4B was significantly upregulated in 98 HCC tissues, compared with adjacent nontumorous samples. Meanwhile, clinicopathological variables and univariate and multivariate survival analyses showed that high VPS4B expression was correlated with multiple clinicopathological factors, including AJCC stage, microvascular invasion, Ki-67 and a poor prognosis. More importantly, univariate and multivariate survival analyses demonstrated that VPS4B served as an independent prognostic factor for survival in HCC patients. Furthermore, we found that VPS4B was lowly expressed in serum-starved Huh7 and HepG2 HCC cells, and was progressively increased after serum-refeeding. To study whether VPS4B could regulate the proliferation of HCC cells, VPS4B was knocked down in both Huh7 and HepG2 cells through the transfection of VPS4B-siRNA oligos. Flow cytometry and CCK-8 assay results indicated that interference of VPS4B led to cell cycle arrest and reduced cell proliferation of HCC cells. Taken together, our results implied that VPS4B could be a candidate prognostic biomarker as well as a potential therapeutical target of HCC.",

Correlations between histologic findings and clinical outcome in this disease have largely been based on evaluation of liver parenchyma. This study aimed to characterize the pattern of inflammation within the biliary remnant and identify associations between the type and degree of inflammation and clinical outcome as reflected by the transplant-free interval. The inflammation within the fibrous plates and livers of 41 patients with biliary atresia was characterized using immunohistochemical markers and the cell populations were digitally quantified. The type and quantity of cells within the infiltrate were then correlated with length of time from Kasai portoenterostomy until transplant. Histologic and immunohistochemical features of the biliary remnant allowed stratification of patients into \u201cinflammatory plate\u201d and \u201cfibrotic plate\u201d groups. Overall there was no significant difference in transplant-free interval between the two cohorts; however, there was a trend towards a longer time to transplant among patients in the \u201cfibrotic plate\u201d group. In addition, the composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in the fibrous plate was distinctly different from that present in the liver and only the characteristics of the inflammation in the fibrous plate, in particular the number of Foxp3+ T regulatory lymphocytes correlated with clinical outcome. The results of this study support the view of the extra-hepatic biliary tree as the primary site of injury in BA with the changes seen in the liver as secondary manifestations of outflow obstruction. The association between specific inflammatory cell subtypes within the fibrous plate and the length of transplant-free interval also supports the role of the immune system in the initial process of bile duct damage in biliary atresia.",

Autophagy is commonly active in tumor cells and could be induced by stress conditions such as hypoxia, nutrient depletion and anticancer therapy. Increasing evidence supports the role of autophagy in modulating cancer behavior in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Despite recent advances in surgery combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, the survival rate of patients with HNSCC has not been improved substantially. To adapt to the hostile microenvironment induced by stress condition including hypoxia and anticancer therapy, more biological changes such as autophagy are induced in tumor cells contributing to their malignant and aggressive behavior. In the present review, we summarized recent findings on the molecules involved in the autophagy induced by hypoxia and anticancer therapy and basic mechanisms of autophagy, and focused on elucidating the role of autophagy in tumor progression of HNSCC. Some novel studies on the relationships between mircoRNA and autophagy were also discussed in this review. A better understanding of this knowledge may provide new ideas and targets for effective prevention and treatment in HNSCC.",

Staining intensities were quantified by an automated software-based algorithm.While TRAIL-R1 and TRAIL-R3 were nearly absent in meningiomas, TRAIL-R2 and TRAIL-R4 were abundantly expressed. However, only TRAIL-R4 expression correlated with the WHO grade of malignancy. Bcl-2 showed a non-significant upregulation in WHO grade III meningiomas. Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression was significantly higher in WHO grade II compared to grade I. Bcl-XL and TRAIL-R4 expression correlated with the mitotic activity (Ki67) of the tumor. Furthermore, TRAIL-R2 expression correlated with TRAIL-R4. Bak expression correlated with both, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 expression. The expression patterns did neither correlate with the progression-free nor with the overall survival of the meningioma patients.Apoptosis-inducing TRAIL-R2 and all key executioners of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway are abundantly expressed in meningioma. For some regulators of apoptosis with opposite functions, the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein significantly correlated with the expression level of the respective anti-apoptotic binding partner, possibly resulting in a steady-state of apoptosis.

     "abstract": "It has been reported that expression levels of DNA repair genes are frequently associated with chemotherapy sensitivity and prognosis in breast cancer (BC) subtypes. The poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1), one of the major DNA single-strand break (SSBs) repair proteins, has been demonstrated a role in BC development. Because many of the chemotherapeutic agents target the tumor cell DNA, a DNA damage repair protein function is expected to impact therapeutic responses. However, the predictive effect of PARP1 in neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC) treated BC is still controversial. To investigate whether PARP1 expression in BC is a possible biomarker to predict chemotherapeutic response, we assessed PARP1 expression in BC specimens based on collagen gel droplet embedded culture-drug sensitivity test (CD-DST) (in vitro) results and chemotherapeutic response of NC (in vivo). The surgical specimens from 108 patients with BC were recruited for CD-DST and PARP1 immunohistochemistry. We found that higher nuclear PARP1 (nPARP1) expression correlated with increased in vitro chemosensitivity against docetaxel (p\u00a0=\u00a00.001) and epirubicin (p\u00a0=\u00a00.022) based on CD-DST results.

Five different DNA extraction protocols were carried out to evaluate the DNA obtained from FFPE samples with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two primer sets to amplify a constitutive human gene, \u03b2-globin, and two primer sets to detect the L1 and E6 HPV genes. From the five DNA extraction protocols evaluated, the best results were obtained with protocol A, corresponding to a crude extract from the sample. With the procedures described herein, we were able to amplify DNA extracted from archival paraffin blocks stored for six years. However, the amplification products were more efficiently obtained with primers that amplified shorter fragments. This result indicates that a major factor limiting the extraction process in these samples is DNA fragmentation, a factor that will naturally vary between the different specimens evaluated. Also, depending upon the extraction method, PCR amplification of a human gene does not necessarily guarantee the successful extraction of viral DNA. In conclusion, different DNA and HPV detection methods can significantly influence the results. Therefore, the DNA extraction methods and primers used for DNA amplification in fixed tissues need to be chosen carefully, depending on the specific requirements of the study being carried out.",

     "abstract": "Four and a half LIM domain protein-2 (FHL2) is part of the focal adhesion structures modulating cell motility. FHL2 may translocate into the nucleus serving as a transcriptional cofactor binding several transcription factors. Overexpression of FHL2 has been linked to cancer progression in various neoplasias. The aim of the present study was to determine, whether FHL2's function as nuclear cofactor plays a prognostic role in invading tumor cells of sporadic and HNPCC-associated colorectal cancer (CRC).Immunohistochemical staining intensity of nuclear FHL2 was quantified by Remmele score analysing 47 sporadic and 42 HNPCC-associated colorectal cancers. Analysis was restricted to carcinoma cells of the tumoral invasion front.Confocal microscopy detected nuclear expression of FHL2 in colon cancer cells and absence of nuclear FHL2 signal in normal colon enterocytes. In colon cancer, nuclear FHL2 expression was predominantly observed in low-differentiated, often mucinous tumor areas. 42.55% of sporadic and 54.76% of HNPCC-associated CRC showed enhanced (Remmele score 6\u201312) nuclear FHL2 expression in the carcinoma cells of the tumoral advancing edge. Enhanced nuclear FHL2 expression was significantly linked to lymphatic metastasis in sporadic CRC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0197) and almost reached significance in HNPCC-associated CRC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0545). In contrast, nuclear FHL2 expression was neither associated with hematogenic metastasis in sporadic (p\u00a0=\u00a00.7087) nor in HNPCC-associated colorectal cancer (p\u00a0=\u00a00.3007).We recently demonstrated that enhanced nuclear FHL2 expression in tumor stroma of sporadic colon cancer is associated with lymphatic metastasis. The results of the present study indicate a synergistic effect of nuclear cofactor FHL2 in tumor cells as well as in peritumoral stroma cells promoting lymphatic metastasis in sporadic CRC. As HNPCC-associated tumors did not show a significant association between tumoral nuclear FHL2 expression and lymphatic metastasis we speculate, that the intensive lymphocytic immune response in HNPCC precludes a direct contact of tumor cells and stromal cells resulting in reduced lymphatic spread.",

The cardiac grafts of allogeneic (Wistar\u2013Lewis rat) and syngeneic (Lewis\u2013Lewis rat) rat models were subjected to histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses for HSPA12B expression on days 0\u20137 after operation.

Our results demonstrated that HSPA12B protein exhibited biphasic patterns in transplanted heart. The first expression phase correlated with ischemical reperfusion injury over 2 days post-transplant. The second peak of HSPA12B expression was found only in allografts on day 5, concurrent with the expression of caspase-3. Immunohistochemical assay showed that compared with rare expression in isografts, there were significant protein expressions of HSPA12B and caspase-3 in heart allografts from day 5 to 7 post-transplant. Furthermore, double immunofluorescence staining for active caspase-3 and HSPA12B in isografts and allografts at day 5 post-transplant were analyzed and colocalization of HSPA12B/active caspase-3 was detected in allografts.

In this study, we investigated the potential role of p29 in the regulation of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) progression. Western blot and immunohistochemistry staining showed that p29 was up-regulated in clinical NSCLC tissues compared with adjacent non-cancerous tissues, and the expression of p29 had a positive correlation with clinical stage and histological differentiation, as well as expression of Ki-67, a proliferating marker. Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis indicated that patients with high level of p29 expression had poor overall survival. In addition, small interfering RNA of p29 was performed, and the effects on NSCLC growth were examined. Interference of p29 blocked S phase entry, inhibited proliferation of A549 cells and up-regulated level of p21 expression.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the NO modulation of AQPs gene expression after brain ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) in rats. The experiment was performed in three groups of rats: sham, control ischemic and l-NAME pretreated (1\u00a0mg/kg). Brain ischemia was induced by 60\u00a0min middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) under continuous recording of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) followed by 12\u00a0h reperfusion. Brain edema was assessed by dry/wet method, and Quantitative RT-PCR was used for assessment of mRNA levels of AQPs. There was 80% reduction in rCBF during MCAO. Brain cerebral ischemia elevated the brain water content from 78.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.17% to 81.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.60%, and inhibition of NO production by l-NAME significantly reduced this elevation (79.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.79%). The mRNA expression of AQP1 increased, but AQP4 decreased in response to I/R. l-NAME pretreatment significantly decreased AQP1 mRNA and prevented the reduction of AQP4 mRNA. The findings of this study indicated that brain I/R injury provokes brain edema by alterations of AQPs expression, and the NO is the main signaling factor that modulates gene expression of these channels.",

Subpleural cystic spaces and areas of lobular remodeling were measured morphometrically. Histologic features were compared to three findings on HRCT: diagnostic pattern (UIP, probable UIP, or inconsistent with UIP pattern), degree of honeycombing, and degree of ground-glass opacities.Histologically, respiratory-lined cysts were observed in 78%, bronchiolectasis in 83%, interstitial emphysema in 22%, lobular remodeling in 96%, NSIP-like areas in 87%, DIP-like reaction in 10%, and mucin extravasation in 78%.

It has been shown to bind cell surface heparin sulphate proteoglycans and integrins, indicating possible functions of CTSX in cellular adhesion, phagocytosis, and immune response. Our previous studies have shown an association between Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, a strong up-regulation of CTSX, and development of gastric cancer. In this study, yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that RPLP0, a ribosomal protein P0, interacts with the human CTSX protein in gastric cancer. The CTSX/RPLP0 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation assays. In addition, co-localization studies in cancer cell line N87 and gastric cancer tissue samples were performed. Laserscan microscopy revealed a shuttling of RPLP0 (and CTSX) from cytoplasm to the nucleus after CTSX knockdown. Down-regulation of RPLP0 resulted in G1 arrest of gastric cancer cells, whereas knockdown of CTSX led to G1 arrest and apoptosis after 48\u00a0h. Knockdown of both proteins caused increased apoptosis. RPLP0 deficiency could suppress cell growth and cell cycle progression by down-regulating CDK2. It was further demonstrated that RPLP0 affected p21 expression, but did not change the expression of Cyclin E. Down-regulation of both proteins at least through CDK2 suggests an anti-apoptotic effect on gastric cancer cells and opens up new possibilities for apoptotic immune modulation and gastric cancer therapy.",

Archival paraffin-embedded CRC tissue samples were used to generate tissue microarray blocks, which were immunohistochemically stained for MMP-2, MMP-9, and VEGF-\u03b1. Three different grading systems were applied to evaluate staining intensity. Chi-squared Person test and Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves were used, and values of p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 were considered statistically significant.MMP-2 expression showed a significant association with more invasive cancer stages (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and death (p\u00a0<\u00a00.041).

     "abstract": "This extended classification of joint implant related pathology is a practical histopathologic classification based on defined morphological criteria covering the complete spectrum of pathohistologic changes in periprosthetic tissues. These changes may occur as a consequence of endoprosthetic replacement of large joints and may lead to a reduction in the prosthesis survival rate. We describe the established consensus classification of the periprosthetic membrane, in which aseptic and septic prosthetic loosening can be subdivided into four histological types, as well as histopathological criteria for additional significant pathologies including endoprosthetic-associated arthrofibrosis, particle-induced immunological, inflammatory and toxic mechanisms (adverse reactions), and bone tissue pathologies. These characteristic tissue alterations and their relationships are summarized in the extended classification. Since particle heterogeneity in periprosthetic tissue is high and particle identification is a necessary part of diagnosis, the identification of different types of particles is described in the histopathological particle algorithm. The morphological qualities of prosthetic material particles and the demarcation between abrasion and non-abrasion endogenous particles are also summarized. This feasible classification which is based on low cost standard tissue processing and examination and on well-defined diagnostic criteria is a solid platform for the histological diagnosis of implant associated pathologies providing a stable and reproducible tool for the surgical pathologist. Since this classification is suitable for standardized histopathological diagnostics, it might also provide a useful data set for joint arthroplasty registers, particularly for registers based on so-called routine data.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers in China. Recent research suggested that activated Cdc42-associated kinase 1 (Ack1) played an important role in facilitating tumorigenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the role of Ack1 in HCC is not clear. Herein, the expression level of Ack1 mRNA in 30 fresh HCC specimens (carcinoma, peri-carcinoma and distal-carcinoma tissues) was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), while the expression of Ack1 protein in 18 fresh HCC specimens (carcinoma, peri-carcinoma and distal-carcinoma tissues) was analyzed by Western blotting. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was also employed to assess both the expression level and distribution of Ack1 protein in HCC tissues collected from 173 lesions, so as to study the correlations between Ack1 protein expression and other HCC-related clinicopathologic parameters. The results showed that both Ack1 mRNA and protein were significantly over-expressed in HCC tissues than that of either peri-carcinoma or distal-carcinoma tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, P\u00a0=\u00a00.012, respectively), while there was no significant difference between peri-carcinoma and distal-carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, the results of IHC indicated that the rates of Ack1 expressions in the patients with capsular invasion, hepatic vessel involvement and recurrence were higher than without above three conditions (P\u00a0=\u00a00.037, P\u00a0=\u00a00.036, P\u00a0=\u00a00.019, respectively), whereas the patients with overexpression of Ack1 protein had low survival rate (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Ack1 expression, tumor size and recurrence were independently related to survival (P\u00a0=\u00a00.014, P\u00a0=\u00a00.018, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001, respectively). Thus, the level of Ack1 is associated with tumor invasion potential, and the expression of Ack1 plays an important role as predictor of recurrence and poor outcome in HCC patients.",

In this study, gastric cancer tissue microarrays were constructed with 159 gastric cancer tissue samples, 150 non-neoplastic gastric epithelium specimens and 152 lymph node samples. Immunohistochemical staining for PEAK1 and E-cadherin was performed. Our study found negative expression of PEAK1 in 113 of 159 (71.1%) gastric cancers, in 46 of 150 (30.7%) non-neoplastic gastric epithelium tissues and in 69 of 94 (73.4%) metastatic lymph nodes. Negative expression of PEAK1 and E-cadherin associated with tumor grading, depth of invasion, lymph node metastases, pTNM stage and macroscopic type. Patients with either positive PEAK1 or E-cadherin expression had a significantly higher survival than those with negative expression. When combined, PEAK1\u2212/E-cadherin\u2212 had a significantly poor prognosis than the rest of the patients. The expression of PEAK1 protein was positively correlated with E-cadherin in cancer tissues. Cox regression analyses showed that PEAK1, E-cadherin and PEAK1\u2212/E-cadherin\u2212 were independent predictors of overall survival. In conclusion, our findings suggest that loss of PEAK1 may play an important role in carcinogenesis and development of gastric cancer through activating epithelial to mesenchymal transition.",

It has been reported that UT-B gene mutations were related to bladder carcinogenesis, and UT-B deletion could induce DNA damage and apoptosis in bladder urothelium. However, the functions and clinical significance of UT-B in human bladder cancer remain unknown. The most common type of bladder cancer is urothelial carcinoma (UC). We hypothesized that UT-B expression was related to bladder UC progress. In this study, UT-B was detected using immunohistochemistry in 52 paraffin-embedded specimens of bladder UC and 10 normal urothelium specimens. The results showed that UT-B protein expression in UC tumor cells was significantly lower as compared with normal urothelial cells (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). UT-B protein expression was significantly reduced with increasing histological grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010). UT-B protein expression in muscle-invasive stage was significantly lower than in non-muscle-invasive stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.014). Taken together, our data suggest that the reduction or loss of UT-B expression may be related to the incidence, progression and invasiveness of bladder UC. UT-B may be a novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarker, as well as a potential therapeutic target in UC of the bladder.",

Subsequently, to evaluate sensitivity and specificity, all FISH probes were hybridized to 16 STS of hitherto unknown diagnosis. DDIT3 translocations occurred in 8/10 (80%) of myxoid liposarcomas. FOXO1 translocations were noted in 4/4 (100%) of alveolar but in none of 7 embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas. All 15 (100%) Ewing sarcomas/PNET and 4 clear cell sarcomas (4/4) harbored EWSR1 translocations. SS18 rearrangements were demonstrated in 8/9 (89%) synovial sarcomas. MDM2 amplification was noted in 7/8 (88%) atypical lipomatous tumors/well-differentiated and 3/3 (100%) dedifferentiated liposarcomas, respectively, but not in four pleomorphic liposarcomas. Sensitivities and specificities ranged from 80% to 100% and from 93% to 100%, respectively, with the highest values observed for FOXO1 (100% each).We conclude, therefore, that is possible to accurately predict the STS subtype using a panel of different subtype-specific FISH probes, thereby greatly facilitating the differential diagnosis of these tumors.",

For experimental study, a total of 14 healthy lambs were divided into two groups with seven animals each. Group A represented the uninfected animals (control), and Group B was formed by infected animals with 15,000 larvae of H. contortus. Blood was collected on days 15, 45, and 75 post-infection (PI) to obtain serum for biochemical analysis: lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), nitrite/nitrate (NOx), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP), and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP). Parasitological stool examination (eggs per gram of feces \u2013 EPG) was performed on days 15, 45, and 75 PI to verify the evolution of the infection. On day 15 PI EPG was negative, but on days 45 and 75 PI the EPG was positive for animals from Group B. In the three periods evaluated it was observed an increase of LDH levels in serum of lambs infected with gastrointestinal nematodes, but on the other hand NOx levels were reduced on the same periods in infected animals. The AOPP and FRAP levels did not differ between groups on days 15 and 45 PI, but increased significantly on day 75 PI in infected lambs. The same variables were studied in 10 lambs naturally infected with helminths, where more than 97% corresponded to H. contortus (hematocrit and EPG values were 18.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.5% and 7120\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02940, respectively). Similar to the experimental study, the levels of NOx reduced, and the levels of LDH, FRAP, and AOPP increased in serum of this animal associated inflammatory infiltrate in the mucosa of the abomasum. Therefore, during the infection by H. contortus it was observed alterations in oxidative markers, indicators of cell lesion confirmed by histological examination of the abomasum, and consequently there were changes in antioxidant levels, with the purpose of cell protection. We also conclude that helminth infection interferes with the nitric oxide metabolism.",

     "abstract": "The lysosomal cysteine carboxypeptidase cathepsin X (CTSX), localized predominantly in immune cells, has been associated with the development and progression of cancer. To determine its specific role in colorectal carcinoma (CRC), we analyzed CTSX expression in non-malignant mucosa and carcinoma of 177 patients as well as in 111 adenomas and related it with clinicopathological parameters. Further, the role of CTSX in the adhesion and invasion of the colon carcinoma cell lines HT-29 and HCT116 was investigated in an in vitro culture cell system with fibroblasts and monocytes, reflecting the situation at the tumor invasion front.Epithelial CTSX expression significantly increased from normal mucosa to adenoma and carcinoma, with highest expression levels in high grade intraepithelial neoplasia and in early tumor stages. Loss of CTSX occurred with tumor progression, and correlated with advanced local invasion, lymph node and distal metastasis, lymphatic vessel and vein invasion, tumor cell budding and poorer overall survival of patients with CRC. The subcellular distribution of CTSX changed from vesicular paranuclear expression in the tumor center to submembranous expression in cells of the invasion front. Peritumoral macrophages showed highest expression of CTSX. In vitro assays identified CTSX as relevant factor for cell\u2013cell adhesion and tumor cell anchorage to fibroblasts and basal membrane components, whereas inhibition of CTSX caused increased invasiveness of colon carcinoma cells in mono- and co-culture. In conclusion, CTSX is involved in early tumorigenesis and in the stabilization of tumor cell formation in CRC. The results suggest that loss of CTSX may be needed for tumor cell detachment, local invasion and tumor progression. In addition, CTSX in tumor-associated macrophages indicates a role for CTSX in the anti-tumor immune response.",

Serum levels of estrogen, progesterone, FSH, and LH were measured by chemiluminescence, and expression of ER, PR, FSHR, and LHR in thyroid tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry in female patients with thyroid adenoma (n\u00a0=\u00a070), nodular goiter (n\u00a0=\u00a073), thyroid papillary cancer (n\u00a0=\u00a0149), poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a012), or undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a08) and in normal controls (n\u00a0=\u00a060). The positive rates of serum estrogen level and ER\u03b1 expression were significantly greater in patients with various types of thyroid neoplasms than in normal controls. The positive rates of ER\u03b2 expression were significantly less in various types of thyroid neoplasms than in normal thyroid tissues, especially in poorly differentiated carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. The negative rates of serum progesterone level and positive rates of PR expression in thyroid tissue were significantly greater in patients with thyroid adenoma, nodular goiter, or thyroid papillary cancer than in normal controls. The positive rates of serum FSH and LH levels and FSHR and LHR expression were significantly greater in the thyroid adenoma group than in other groups. Our findings suggest that thyroid neoplasms might be sex hormone-dependent. The positive expression of ER\u03b1 and PR often indicates thyroid papillary carcinoma, and the ER\u03b2 expression status is important for the diagnosis of poorly differentiated carcinoma and undifferentiated carcinoma. In addition, thyroid adenoma is often accompanied by an increase in serum FSH and LH levels, as well as FSHR and LHR expression. Thus, the combined detection of serum levels of sex hormones and expression of their receptors allows for a differential diagnosis and evaluation of the degree of differentiation among various types of thyroid neoplasms.",

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a malignant lung tumor which shares histopathological and genetic features with MCC, as both are of neuroendocrine origin. In this study, we investigated the presence of MCPyV DNA in SCLC specimens by real-time PCR. Our null hypothesis was that MCPyV is an etiologic factor in SCLC, as previously seen in MCC. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens were obtained from 50 patients, who underwent bronchoscopic biopsy and were diagnosed with SCLC between March 2010 and March 2012. Similarly, we obtained bronchoscopic biopsy specimens from 29 patients, who were diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All samples were obtained at a single center (Masih Daneshvari Hospital, Tehran, Iran). Real-time PCR was done to detect the presence of MCPyV DNA. After excluding one specimen from the SCLC group due to loss of tumor tissue, we did not detect MCPyV DNA in samples from patients with either SCLC (the mean age 58.9 years, male/female ratio: 7.3/1) or NSCLC. Our results suggest that MCPyV does not play a role in the pathogenesis of SCLC, which is in accord with the results from other prior investigations.",

For this purpose, 72 Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus) were divided into six groups (A, B, C, D, E, and F). Each group was subdivided into two other subgroups in order to assess the biochemical and histological results on days 7 and 40 post-treatment (PT). Treatments were carried out based on two different therapeutic protocols: L-DMZ and C-DMZ at 3.5\u00a0mg/kg\u22121, single dose (groups C and D), and five successive doses within intervals of 24\u00a0h (groups E and F). Groups A and B corresponded to uninfected and infected (without treatment) animals, respectively. Sample collections were held on days 7 and 40 PT for the assessment of hepatic [alkaline phosphatase (AP), alanine transferase (ALT), albumin, gamma glutamil transferase (GGT) and renal functions (creatinine and urea). Additionally, the histology of fragments of liver, kidney, and spleen was performed. Animals in group B showed a significant increase in AP, GGT, ALT, and urea when compared with group A. On day 7 post-inoculation (PI), the biochemical analysis showed a reduction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) of AP and GGT, while the levels of urea were increased in groups C, D, E, F. On day 40 PT, ALT was increased in these same groups when compared with group A. In histopathology, changes in liver samples were observed on day 7 PT in groups D and F, especially regarding the area and density of the hepatocytes. Renal analysis exhibited changes in glomerular space, glomerular, and corpuscular areas in group E. Therefore, these results allowed us to conclude that the treatment with L-DMZ and C-DMZ led to variable biochemical changes, which defined the functions of the liver and kidneys of treated animals, since the main histopathology alterations were observed in animals treated with liposomes, at their higher dosages. Thus, treatments with L-DMZ and C-DMZ in five consecutive doses were effective although being followed by liver toxicity.",

This prospective multicenter study was undertaken to investigate different histologic parameters arguing in favor or against the diagnosis of reactive gastropathy and to correlate findings with patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings. A total of 1123 individuals aged 15\u201393 years participated in a prospective multicenter study (histoGERD trial). Diagnosis of Helicobacter gastritis was made following the Updated Sydney System. Diagnosis of reactive gastropathy was based upon Dixon's parameters of foveolar hyperplasia, smooth muscle fibers in the lamina propria and vasodilatation and congestion of mucosal capillaries. Including paucity of acute and chronic inflammatory cells in analysis, a new score with visual analog scales for the diagnosis of reactive gastropathy was developed. All three histologic parameters in favor of the diagnosis of reactive gastropathy were positively associated with the endoscopic diagnosis of gastritis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), yet negatively with Helicobacter infection (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). In contrast, presence of acute and chronic inflammatory cells in lamina propria was positively associated with Helicobacter infection (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), yet not with the endoscopic diagnosis of gastritis. Our score demonstrated strong association between histologic and endoscopic diagnoses (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), yet not with patient's symptoms. In conclusion, our data prove foveolar hyperplasia, smooth muscle fibers and vasodilatation and congestion as key histologic parameters for the diagnosis of reactive gastropathy.

     "abstract": "One of the most common malignant diseases, both worldwide and in Poland, is gastric cancer. The pathogenesis of gastric cancer development is not entirely clear. Next to the environmental risk factors, such as Helicobacter pylori infection or dietary habits, the host genetic factors as predispositions to gastric cancer development are discussed. A transmembrane protein that could be associated with predisposition to cancer development is P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Physiologically, P-gp is present in normal tissue of the gastrointestinal tract, where it plays a protective role by transporting xenobiotics from a cell into extracellular environment. P-gp is encoded by the highly polymorphic ABCB1 gene. The most frequent polymorphisms at positions 1236, 2677, and 3435 may affect both the function and amount of protein, thereby leading to a loss of its physiological function, which could increase the predisposition to development of many diseases, including cancer. In this study, the potential significance of the ABCB1 gene in the development and progression of gastric cancer was evaluated.In 19 tissue samples collected from patients with gastric cancer, the ABCB1 gene polymorphisms were identified at positions 1236 and 2677 by automated sequencing and SNP 3435 by the RFLP method. The relative level of ABCB1 expression was measured in 10 samples of gastric cancer and morphologically normal tissues by real-time PCR.For SNPs at positions 1236, 2677, and 3435, no statistically significant differences in genotype frequencies between gastric cancer patients and healthy individuals were found. However, genotype TT for all studied polymorphisms occurred more frequently in the group of gastric cancer patients (31.6, 26.3, 42.1%, respectively) than in the group of healthy individuals (14.6, 13.5, 21.9%, respectively). The lowest relative expression levels of ABCB1 mRNA were observed for genotypes CC of SNP 1236, CC of SNP 3435, and GG of SNP 2677 (median: 0.215, 0.160, 0.160, respectively). There was a tendency that mutant homozygote TT for SNPs at positions 1236, 2677, and 3435 occurred more frequently in the subgroup of patients with Tis or stage I of TNM classification (SNP 1236 p\u00a0=\u00a00.0760; SNP 2677 p\u00a0=\u00a00.0813; SNP 3435 p\u00a0=\u00a00.0760) than in the subgroup of patients with stage II or III. Also the expression levels were lowest (median 0.740) in the group of patients with the less advanced clinical stage of cancer (Tis or I).Preliminary research showed that the ABCB1 gene polymorphisms at positions 1236, 2677, and 3435 were not related to an increased susceptibility of gastric cancer development. However, they may be associated with the inhibition of gastric cancer progression.",

     "abstract": "Accurate diagnosis of invasive breast lesions, when analyzed by Core Needle Biopsy, may suppose a major challenge for the pathologist. Various markers of invasiveness such as laminin, S-100 protein, P63 or calponin have been described; however, none of them is completely reliable. The use of a specific marker of the infiltrating tumor microenvironment seems vital to support the diagnosis of invasive against in situ lesions. At this point, Collagen, type XI, alpha 1 (COL11A1), might be helpful since it has been described to be associated to cancer associated fibroblasts in other tumors such as lung, pancreas or colorectal. This paper aims to analyze the role of COL11A1 as a marker of invasiveness in breast tumor lesions.Two hundred and one breast Core Needle Biopsy samples were analyzed by immunohistochemistry against pro-COL11A1. The results show a significant difference (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) when comparing the expression in infiltrative tumors (93%) versus immunostaining of non-invasive lesions (4%). Forty cases of underestimated DCIS were also stained for COL11A1, presenting a sensitivity of 90% when compared with p63 and calponin which not tagged invasion.In conclusion, pro-COL11A1 expression is a promising marker of invasive breast lesions, and may be included in immunohistochemical panels aiming at identifying infiltration in problematic breast lesions.",

It has been reported that GPCRs play vital roles in the development and progression of cancer. To investigate the potential roles of GPR37 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), expression of GPR37 was examined in human HCC samples. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analyses were performed for GPR37 in 57 hepatocellular carcinoma samples. GPR37 expression was low in hepatocellular carcinoma as compared with the adjacent non-tumorous tissues. Clinicopathological analysis showed that GPR37 expression was significantly correlated with histological grade and the level of alpha fetal protein (AFP) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000 and 0.002, respectively). The Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves revealed that decreasing GPR37 expression was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients, while in vitro, following the release from serum starvation of HuH7 HCC cell, the expression of GPR37 was downregulated. In addition, the transient GPR37 knockdown by siRNA in HuH7 cells significantly decreased the apoptosis of hepatoma cells with activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. Our data suggest that GPR37 may play an important role in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma by affecting the proliferation of H CC cells, and it could be a novel potential molecular therapy target for HCC.",

Their role has previously been described in colorectal cancer, as well as in gastric, breast, thyroid, prostate, ovarian, pancreatic, glioma, liver, leukemia and many other cancers.In a previous study, we have described protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type T, M, Z1 and Q genes (PTPRT, PTPRM, PTPRZ1 and PTPRQ) hypermethylated in sporadic colorectal cancer. Thus, in this study, we examined the relation of unbalanced chromosomal alterations within regions covering these four protein tyrosine phosphatase genes with this cancer.One hundred and two cancer tissues were molecularly characterized, including analysis of the BRAF and K-ras mutations and methylator phenotype. The analysis of chromosomal aberrations was performed using Comparative Genomic Hybridization.We observed amplification of three regions containing genes coding for PTPs, such as PTPRZ1 (7q31.3, amplified in 23.5% of cases), PTPRQ (12q21.2, amplified in 5.9% of cases), PTPRT (20q12, amplified in 29.4% of cases), along with deletions in the region of PTPRM (18p11.2, deleted in 21.6% of cases). These data may suggest that in sporadic colorectal cancer PTPRZ1, PTPRT, PTPRQ probably act as oncogenes, while PTPRM acts as a tumor suppressor gene. Our study also revealed that gains on chromosome 20q12 and losses on chromosome 18p11.2 are connected with the absence of the BRAF mutation and the conventional adenocarcinoma pathway.",

The aim of the study was to analyze microvascular density in prostatic adenocarcinoma in relationship to ERG expression. This is a retrospective study of 112 cases whose aim is to compare MVD in ERG-positive and negative cases and to test its relationship with other pathological parameters. Immunohistochemical stains for ERG and CD31 were done using standard methods, using tissue microarrays. The cases were classified as ERG-positive and negative and the CD31-positive vessels were counted. Fifty-one cases (45.54%) were positive for ERG, and the average MVD was 111.81\u00a0vessels/mm2 (standard deviation, SD 54.20) for the entire group, 101.30\u00a0vessels/mm2 (SD 50.60) for ERG-negative and 124.38\u00a0vessels/mm2 (SD 56.17) for ERG-positive cases. There was only a slight tendency for higher MVD in higher grades and stages of cancer. None of other parameters, such as patients\u2019 age, lymphovascular invasion, presence of intraductal carcinoma or positive surgical margin, showed a significant relationship to MVD.

Aiming to examine further the striking resemblance of clear cell epithelial neoplasia in pancreas and kidney, we compared the microvascular profile and expression of pro-angiogenic factors in SN and in CCRCC using immunohistochemical stains. SN and CCRCC shared a predominance of differentiated blood vessels, scarcity of lymphatic vessels, presence of CD105 and claudin-5 in tumoral vessels, expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), carbonic anhydrase IX in tumoral cells, and lack of VEGF-C in tumoral cells. In contrast to CCRCC, SN showed lower pericyte coverage of vessels, lower blood vessel endothelial cell proliferaction fraction, more pronounced VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-2 and glucose transporter-1 expression, higher inducible (iNOS) but lower endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, as well as presence of VEGFR-3 and D2-40 expression in epithelial cells.

To investigate the dynamic changes of miR-106a in each stage during gastric carcinogenesis, we used formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues which had been reported to have valuable information for miRNA research in our previous studies. Here, we compared the expression of miR-106a in FFPE and fresh frozen tissues using real-time polymerase chain reaction. On the basis of the high correlation of miR-106a quantitative data from the two resources, FFPE samples were subsequently performed to elucidate the location and expression of miR-106a using in situ hybridization in sequential tissues, including normal gastric mucosa, chronic atrophic gastritis combined with various degrees of dysplasia, early and advanced gastric cancer. Finally, we found that miR-106a was similarly up-regulated in gastric cancer regardless of sample types although fragmentation existed inevitably in FFPE tissues. Notably, the frequency and extent of miR-106a expression gradually increased during the transition from atypical hyperplasia to advanced carcinoma and had already had positive signals in early precancerous lesions but negative signals in normal gastric mucosal epithelial cells. Our research, according to these results, indicated that FFPE samples can serve as an important research tool for miRNA field, and the early changes of miR-106a detected in such samples may have clinical application as a potential biomarker for the discovery and diagnosis of gastric cancer.",

Eighty-one cases were included in the study; there were 37 benign, 25 borderline and 19 malignant primary mucinous ovarian tumors. For each case, a total staining score was determined, consisting of scores for extent of staining and intensity of staining. The cases were allocated to negative, weakly positive and strongly positive staining categories, according to the total staining score.Both of the markers were significantly negative in benign tumors as compared with borderline and malignant tumors. There was no significant difference between borderline and malignant groups for both markers. Sixty-eight percent of malignant tumors were stained positive by fascin, while this rate was 40% for borderline mucinous tumors. All malignant tumors were strongly stained positive for EMMPRIN, while this rate was 92% for borderline mucinous tumors. The rest of the cases stained weakly positive.

In that context, EMMPRIN and fascin expression may have potential application in the differential diagnosis of some diagnostically problematic mucinous ovarian tumors. However, the differential diagnostic applicability of EMMPRIN appears to be more limited than that of fascin due to its wide spectrum of staining in mucinous ovarian tumors.",

The probability to have a malformed fetus with a weight less than 1500\u00a0g was three times higher in myelomeningocele than in craniorachischisis, two times higher in anencephaly and encephalocele, but two times lower than rachischisis.

     "abstract": "Thyroid nodules are common among adults with only a small percentage being malignant and histologically mimic benign nodules. Accurate diagnosis of these thyroid nodules is critical for the proper clinical management. The determination of malignancy in follicular patterned thyroid lesions is based on postoperative histological findings. Therefore, affected patients are referred for surgery, although only 10% will have a final diagnosis of malignancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of two immunohistochemical (IHC) markers; galectin-3 and Hector Battifora mesothelial-1 (HBME-1) individually or in combination, to distinguish between benign (non-neoplastic and neoplastic) and malignant (follicular and papillary carcinomas) thyroid lesions removed by surgical resection.We investigated the immunoexpression of galectin-3 and HBME-1 in 50 cases of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. The benign group included 13 cases of thyroid nodular goiter (NG) and 9 cases of follicular adenoma (FA). The malignant group included 5 cases of follicular thyroid carcinomas (FC), 18 cases of classic papillary thyroid carcinoma and 5 cases of follicular variant papillary carcinoma (FVPC).The staining results showed that malignant tumors expressed galectin-3 and HBME-1 significantly more than benign nodules. The sensitivity of these markers for the distinction between benign and malignant lesions ranged from 89.3% to 92.9%. Co-expression of galectin-3 and HBME-1 was seen in 82.1% of carcinomas, but in none of the benign nodules. Immunoexpression was usually diffuse in malignant tumors, and focal in the benign lesions.Our findings indicate that these immunohistochemical markers are significantly more expressed in malignant tumors compared to benign lesions and may be of additional diagnostic value when combined with routine histology. Galectin-3 has higher sensitivity and specificity of immunoexpression in thyroid malignancy than HBME-1, and the combined use of galectin-3 and HBME-1 can increase the specificity of immunoexpression in malignant tumors.",

Rats were made acutely hypertensive by aortic constriction above the renal arteries. After 8 days, arterial pressure was recorded and BBB permeability was evaluated by the Evans blue dye extravasations (EBE) technique. Quantitative RT-PCR was used for assessment of mRNA expression of claudins (claudin-3, 5 & 12). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activity, as well as glutathione and malondialdehyde content were determined by biochemical methods. Aortic constriction significantly enhanced arterial pressure and EBE of hypertensive rats by 35% and 76%, respectively. Enzyme activity of SOD and catalase were significantly lower in hypertensive rats. Hypertension significantly decreased the brain glutathione content and increased the brain malondialdehyde level. Also, the mRNA levels of claudins (3, 5 & 12) proteins significantly decreased in response to hypertension. Our findings indicated that acutely elevated arterial pressure provokes brain microvascular permeability by diminution of claudins genes transcription in the endothelial cells of BBB. Our results also showed that short-term hypertension impairs the antioxidant defense system of brain and induces brain injury through oxidative stress.",

Myocardial lipotoxicity and cardiac steatosis have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetic mellitus (DM).

Nevertheless, the significance of fatty heart in the disease process is still unclear. Here, we investigated myocardial lipid deposition (LD) in 73 autopsy cases. Nile blue staining revealed seven cases (9.5%) showing LD with elevated tissue triglyceride content, all of which suffered from DM. Immunohistochemically, ATGL expression was preserved in all tested cases. Rates of myocardial infarction and heart failure were higher in LD/DM cases than in non-LD cases. Semi-quantitative histological analysis revealed no significant differences in the degree of myocardial hypertrophy, myofibrillar loss, fibrosis, small vascular disease, inflammation or fat invasion between LD/DM and non-LD cases. However, more severe histological damage was seen in DM cases than in non-DM cases. Our data suggest that DM is a major risk for fatty heart with myocardial LD based on recent autopsy cases.",

Cause of death was determined incidental to the coronary findings in every case. Stented segments were embedded in paraffin and stained immunohistochemically for CD68 (macrophages), and endothelial marker PECAM-1 (CD31). Computerized morphometry was performed to quantitate neovessel density for CD31, macrophage infiltrates, as well as plaque and neointimal area. In-stent restenosis was defined as luminal narrowing \u226575% cross-section of the stented area. Underlying plaque morphology was classified as fibrous or atheromatous. Neovessels were present in the neointima of 57 stented segments (88%). Mean neovessel density was greater in restenotic vs. non-restenotic neointimas (p\u00a0=\u00a00.009) and macrophage density was also greater (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006).

The rabbit models of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque (VAP) were established by high fat diet and pharmaceutical triggering. The serum RANTES levels of VAP group (91.97\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.51\u00a0ng/ml) were significantly higher than those of AS (atherosclerosis) group (50.03\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.92\u00a0ng/ml). Consistently, the mRNA and protein of RANTES in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques were also obviously up-regulated compared to AS group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Moreover, corrected plaque area and vulnerability index of VAP group proved to be significantly higher than AS group. The correlation coefficient between RANTES and plaque vulnerability indicated that RANTES, especially plaque RANTES, was positively correlated with VAP. In addition, increased expression of nuclear factor kappa B p65 (NF-\u03baB p65) was observed in VAP group compared to AS group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), which partly accounted for the increased RANTES levels. In conclusion, positive associations between RANTES and plaque vulnerability suggest that higher RANTES levels may be associated with atherosclerosis and high-risk plaques. Our study highlights the utility of both serum and plaque RANTES levels as indicators of plaque vulnerability in the field of preventive cardiology.",

For that, 48 rats were divided into six groups (A\u2013F), eight animals each group. Groups A, C and D were composed of uninfected animals, while animals in groups B, E and F were inoculated intraperitoneally with T. evansi. Groups A and B were used as controls, negative and positive, respectively. Groups C and E receive oil (orally), as well as the animals in groups D and F were treated with nanoencapsulated essential oil. The treatment was not able to eliminate the parasites, but it remained the levels of parasitemia low. The carbonyl levels in liver and kidney did not differ between groups. Infected animals (group B) showed an increase in the TBARS levels and a decrease in the CAT activity and NPSH levels in liver and kidney, compared with the same parameters in the control (group A). Treatment with A. satureioides (groups C and D) did not influence the TBARS levels and CAT activity in the liver, but it increased the CAT activity in kidneys of the animals of group C. NPSH levels decreased in liver in the groups treated with nanoencapsulated essential oil (groups D and F). An interesting result observed was that the animals infected and then treated with essential oil of A. satureioides (groups E and F) did not differ from animals of group A for TBARS, CAT and NPSH, unlike what happened with the animals of group B. Therefore, the treatment with essential oil did not eliminate the parasites from the bloodstream, but it reduced the number of trypanosomes, mainly by its nanoencapsulated form. The same occurred with the lipid peroxidation in the liver. However, the treatments reduced the oxidative damage, and it led to the activation of the antioxidant enzymes.

Absence of dysplasia in CCP usually aids in this distinction. We present a challenging case of CCP in the setting of Crohn disease (CD) containing foci of atypical epithelium. A right hemicolectomy from a 46-year-old woman contained a stricture associated with a proximal multilocular cystic lesion containing mucin-filled glands dissecting through the colonic wall. These glands had lobulated architecture with smooth contours surrounded by lamina propria and lacking desmoplastic stroma. The epithelium had focal nuclear crowding, enlargement, and hyperchromasia, with increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, but overall preserved polarity. Atypical cells were focally positive for CK7 and p53, with increased MIB-1 staining. These findings were interpreted as indefinite for dysplasia. Chronic transmural inflammation and mucosal regeneration probably facilitated epithelial misplacement, which secondarily developed cytologic atypia. However, the overall architecture and lack of dysplasia in the overlying mucosa argue against a diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Our case illustrates the difficult diagnosis of this uncommon but problematic phenomenon, awareness of which is paramount for pathologists and clinicians participating in the management of CD patients.",

The effects and damage are represented by histopathological changes and different types of chromosomal aberrations in dams, in addition to teratogenic changes in the feti. Pregnant dams revealed a significant decrease in their body weights and gross enlargement of the liver. Histologically, the liver showed necrotic areas and congested central vein. The kidneys revealed interstitial hemorrhages, renal casts, degeneration and necrosis. The lungs revealed lymphocytic infiltrates in the interstitial tissue, while the spleen revealed lymphoid depletion. Chromosomal analysis revealed both structural and numerical chromosomal aberration, including centromeric attenuations, chromatid gaps, chromatid breaks, end-to-end associations, fragments, ring chromosomes, deletions, dicentric chromosomes, chromosomal fusions, centric fusions, stickness and hypoployploidy. Centromeric attenuations and end-to-end associations were more frequent than other chromosomal aberrations. Concerning the teratogenic effects in the fetuses, the toxin induced multiple skeletal anomalies. These anomalies included incomplete ossification of skull bones and failure of ossification of long and flat bones.",

In the current report, we present the results of hematologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, chromosomal microarray and molecular analyses of a 60-year-old female patient diagnosed with AML-M2. Cytogenetic analysis revealed complex chromosomal findings involving seven different chromosomes. However, cytogenetic analyses were not able to precisely unveil all karyotypic changes, hence chromosomal microarray was used for further characterization. The most interesting observation was identification of a t(7;12) (q11;q22) as part of this complex karyotype.

A complete blood cell count revealed leukocytosis, anemia and thrombocytopenia with \u223c80% lymphocytes. In contrast to the LGL cells, the blood lymphocytes at this time were medium-large in size and had oval/irregular nuclei, condensed chromatin, indistinct nucleoli and a moderate amount of basophilic cytoplasm, many with elongated vacuoles, and some with cytoplasmic projections. The abnormal lymphocytes comprised \u223c30% of the bone marrow cellularity with interstitial infiltrates/aggregates.

Because of the chronological sequence of the two T-cell neoplasms, this case was initially considered an aggressive transformation of T-LGL. However, this was ultimately excluded by a discordant CD4-subset restriction and the presence of a distinct clonal identity. While these two T-cell neoplasms may have intrinsic connections, the underlying pathogenesis remains to be investigated.",

Several morphological variants have been recognized in the last two decades, including infiltrating, cellular, fibrous/collagenized, epithelioid/deciduoid-like cell, lipomatous and myxoid variants. Myxoid MFB is an extremely rare variant which can represent a potential diagnostic pitfall, posing differential diagnostic problems with other myxoid lesions occurring primarily in the breast parenchyma. We first report an unusual case of mammary MFB showing so extensive myxoedematous stromal changes that obscured the underlying neoplastic cells, rendering difficult its recognition as MFB. Tumor was composed of a few bland-looking spindled, stellate cells embedded in an abundant myxoedematous stroma containing thin and thick collagen fibers and numerous blood vessels with fibrin and foamy histiocytes deposits in their walls. Identification of a small-sized cellular area, with morphological and immunohistochemical features consistent with mammary-type MFB, was crucial for a correct diagnostic interpretation of the lesion. These unusual stromal and vascular features are likely morphological changes to which undergo long-standing mammary MFBs in response to ischemic, traumatic or inflammatory stimuli. Differential diagnostic problems with benign and malignant myxoid lesions of the breast parenchyma are discussed. The present case, for which the term \u201cmammary MFB with extensive myxoedematous stromal changes\u201d is proposed, contributes to widen the morphological spectrum of this unusual mammary tumor, suggesting that when pathologist is dealing with a hypocellular myxoedematous lesion of the breast, a MFB should be ruled out.",

For clinical staging and therapeutic purposes, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cytology and lung biopsy were performed. The biopsy specimen revealed the left lower lung mass to be immunohistochemically ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase)-positive adenocarcinoma. Using the BAL specimen from the left lower lung, EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4)-ALK variant 1 fusion gene was detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). His past history showed that he had undergone an operation for lung adenocarcinoma of the right lower lobe 15 years before, and the pathological specimen at that time revealed that the lung adenocarcinoma with pleural invasion and single metastasis of mediastinal lymph node showed a mucinous cribriform pattern and/or signet-ring cell pattern. The typical histology led us to examine the ALK rearrangement in the primary lung cancer and mediastinal metastatic tumor. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for ALK was positive, and ALK break apart fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) showed a positive result. Moreover, RT-PCR using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from the right lung cancer also demonstrated EML4\u2013ALK variant 1 fusion gene. Although there is a possibility that the left lung cancer is de novo one with multiple metastases, detection of the same fusion gene of the very rare EML4\u2013ALK variant 1 in both tumors suggests that the left cancer is a recurrence of the right lung cancer after an interval of 15 years.",

Expression of Gem was significantly negatively correlated with histological grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.020), and vascular invasion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005), and Gem was also negatively correlated with proliferation marker Ki-67 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). More importantly, the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves analysis revealed that low expression of Gem was associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. Univariate analysis showed that Gem expression was associated with poor prognosis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). Multivariate analysis indicated that Gem expression was an independent prognostic marker for HCC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). Finally, serum starvation and release experiments showed that Gem expression was negatively related with cell proliferation. In the conclusion, our results suggested that down regulation of Gem expression was involved in the pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma, and it might be a favorable independent prognostic parameter for HCC.",

Stained-cell subpopulations up to 90% were not uncommon in the benign tumors. Up to 80% of cells in PLGA could be stained. Staining was weak to intense and confined to the cytoplasm of preferentially non-luminal or adjacent to stroma cells. One adenoid cystic Ca showed nuclear staining. The results suggest that WT1 is often highly expressed in benign non-oncocytic salivary tumors whereas the malignant tumors show decreased expression, the exception being PLGA. The expression is usually cytoplasmic and associated with non-luminal cells. PLGA immunoreactivities could be useful in histological differential diagnosis.",

According to where the larvae settle in the gastrointestinal tract, anisakidosis may have different clinical symptoms. In particular, intestinal anisakidosis may mimic several surgical conditions, including appendicitis, ileitis, diverticulitis or inflammatory bowel disease. For this reason, diagnosis is often histopathological. In the present paper, we describe the clinico-pathological findings of six novel cases of intestinal anisakidosis occurred in southern Italy, and provide clues for the differential diagnosis toward Crohn's disease and eosinophilic enteritis, which have similar histopathological characteristics.

We thought to study the expression of PSMA in a series of CRCs in order to test for its possible use as a target for antiangiogenic cancer therapy in Egyptian patients. One hundred CRC cases were retrieved. Representative sections from each tumor were subjected to immunohistochemistry using PSMA antibodies and CD31 antibodies as reference marker. Accordingly vascular endothelial cell immunoreactivity was semiquantitatively scored. PSMA immunostaining was positive in the neovasculature of 75% of tumors. A statistically significant relation was found between PSMA immunostaining and distant metastasis as well as vascular invasion. The present findings strengthen the evidence on the potential usefulness of PSMA as a therapeutic vascular target.

     "abstract": "Many emerging tools for comprehensive molecular profiling of malignant lesions demand fresh frozen tissue with a high tumor purity. Often, a tumor epithelial content of at least 80% is recommended. This approach may lead to a systematic bias, and therefore we explore if this introduces a selection of cases with a certain phenotype in cervical cancer. Clinicopathologic data for a population-based cohort of 328 patients have been studied. Fresh frozen tumor specimens were available for 151 of these patients and investigated for epithelial tumor cell portion in hematoxylin-stained frozen sections by light microscopy. The estimated tumor purity in the samples was compared with FIGO stage, histopathologic characteristics and survival. High tumor purity was significantly more often found in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) compared to adenocarcinoma (AC) (P\u00a0=\u00a00.03). For the subgroup of AC (n\u00a0=\u00a040), there was a significant association between high tumor purity in the fresh frozen samples and later occurrence of recurrent disease (P\u00a0=\u00a00.04). In SCC, no significant associations between tumor purity and disease stage, grade or outcome were found. Apparently in line with this, grade was found to influence prognosis in AC, but not in SCC. Our findings suggest that selection of samples based on high tumor purity in fresh frozen tissue may introduce a selection bias toward aggressive disease for the subgroup of AC, but not for SCC of the cervix. Thus, the prevalence of potential molecular biomarkers identified in AC in particular should be validated in a population-based setting to further explore clinical relevance. Also, molecular biomarkers only prevalent in subgroups with low tumor purity may go undetected in sample collections enriched for high tumor purity.",

This new \u201cPolyp Epidemic\u201d raises a series of problems and challenges. It became clear that many syndromes are defined by the number, histological type and location of polyps, together with extraintestinal manifestations and, in most cases, specific molecular changes. This paper discusses some of the above mentioned points, focusing on the relative role of endoscopists and pathologists. The objective is to reach an operative classification of the most common polyps observed in daily practice which might be of help for the identification of inherited syndromes.Six main histological types of polyps are defined and underlined: Adenoma, hyperplastic/serrated, hamartoma, ganglioneuroma, mixed, inflammatory. The importance of a brief description, in pathology reports, of each type of polyps is fundamental for a correct diagnosis. Each of the defined polyps is associated with inherited syndromes whose genetic basis has recently been elucidated. Relevant information should be given, and separated from additional (and not strictly necessary) information.A correct polyp analysis is a valuable element for identifying specific inherited syndromes. Polyps represent a precious tool for planning screening and follow-up in a given individual. In addition, these lesions focus the interest of clinicians toward syndrome which were considered as rare diseases; indeed, the explosion of molecular biology and the diffusion of colonoscopy revealed that these conditions are frequent and amenable of treatment.",

Both SDF-1 and CXCR4 had statistically significant higher expression in carcinomas compared with adjacent normal breast tissue. Furthermore the expression of CXCR4 in intratumoral fibroblasts had a positive correlation with overall and disease-free survival, while SDF1 membranous immunopositivity in normal breast epithelial cells was a risk factor for relapse. In addition, expression of SDF1 in fibroblasts of normal breast tissue was positively associated with tumor grade. Overall, our results suggest that the differential expression of CXCR4 in intratumoral stroma and SDF1 in adjacent normal mammary cells may predict clinical outcome in breast cancer patients.",

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of TOP2A gene for the efficacy of neo-adjuvant anthracycline in a population with locally advanced breast cancer. Sixty-two patients were included, and the status of TOP2A gene was determined by in situ hybridization method. Treatment efficacy was determined by clinical and pathological response and overall survival. TOP2A gene alterations were found in 22.6% (21.0% of cases with amplification and 1.6% with deletion), and these tumors were biologically more aggressive, with higher nuclear grade, more frequently with HER2 amplification and inflammatory type. Also in these tumors response to chemotherapy appeared to be increased. There was a higher clinical and pathological response rate (complete pathological response of 21.4% vs. 8.3%), a trend toward longer progression-free survival (82.51 vs. 63.12 months) and a trend to increased overall survival (92.08 months; 95% CI 82.81\u2013101.35 vs. 73.40 months; 95% CI 63.44\u201383.36; p\u00a0=\u00a00.113).

The impacts of CEACAM5 expression patterns on tumor progression were evaluated by statistics, the clinical and pathological data included sex, age, tumor extension, lymph node involvement and tumor staging.There was no CEACAM5 expression in normal gastric epithelial cells. In hyperplastic polyps, CEACAM5 was expressed with apical membranous staining in the hyperplastic and prolonged gastric pit adjacent to the surface. Intestinal metaplasia (IM) expressed CEACAM5 mainly with membranous pattern, and some cases showed membranous staining mixed with cytoplasmic staining. GIN expressed CEACAM5 mainly with membranous staining, but the mixed staining of cytoplasmic and membranous patterns increased, and especially in the high grade GIN, cytoplasmic staining of CEACAM5 began to occur. Compared with IM and GIN, CEACAM5 expression patterns of hyperplastic polyp showed a significant difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000). IM, low grade GIN and the whole GIN showed no significant difference in CEACAM5 expression patterns (P\u00a0=\u00a00.355), but IM and high grade GIN showed a significant difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.027). There was a significant difference between low and high grade GIN (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002). GIN and well-differentiated carcinomas showed no significant difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.070), but low grade GIN and well differentiated carcinomas showed a significant difference (P\u00a0=\u00a00.006). In gastric adenocarcinomas, CEACAM5 expression patterns showed a significant difference in tumor grading (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and Laur\u00e9n classification (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In histological grading, well differentiated carcinomas showed more membranous staining than moderately and poorly differentiated, and more cytoplasmic CEACAM5 staining was detected in moderately and poorly differentiated carcinomas. Similar to that, in Laur\u00e9n classification, intestinal carcinomas showed more membranous staining, and diffuse carcinomas showed more cytoplasmic staining. Moreover, CEACAM5 expression patterns showed a significant difference in tumor extension (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012), lymph node involvement (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and tumor staging (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), suggesting that CEACAM5 should be involved in tumor progression. In advanced carcinomas, CEACAM5 was expressed with more cytoplasmic staining regardless of the histological classification.CEACAM5 had different expression patterns in gastric non-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions. The CEACAM5 expression patterns were associated with tumor progression. Membranous staining of CEACAM5 might be a marker of premalignancy in gastric lesions, and cytoplasmic CEACAM5 might enhance tumor invasion and migration and be an evaluated marker for progressive and advanced gastric cancer. Also, it might be useful for the differential diagnosis of gastric premalignant lesions.",

We present a case of a slowly increasing mass within the left vastus lateralis muscle. At first presentation the patient showed a partially calcified well defined mass with a diameter of 5\u00a0cm and with no direct contact to the femur. A biopsy from the periphery revealed an ossifying lesion compatible with myositis ossificans. The patient returned 18 months later with the lesion having increased to a diameter of 25\u00a0cm. The resection specimen revealed a well delimitated tumor with a central core of partially necrotic neoplastic bone. Besides, histology showed high mitotic areas with pleomorphic spindle cells and regions with cartilaginous differentiation. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated: vimentin+, CD34\u2212, desmin\u2212, actin\u2212, EMA\u2212 and pancytokeratin\u2212 with focal S100 protein positivity and a Ki-67 index of 20%. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed a gain of chromosomal material on 12q; FISH analyses for the CDK4 and MDM2 region showed high level amplifications. Consequently, a high-grade dedifferentiated extraskeletal osteosarcoma was diagnosed. In conclusion, analysis of the MDM2 and CDK4 status is a powerful and discriminating diagnostic tool to distinguish dedifferentiated extraskeletal osteosarcoma from other benign/malignant ossifying lesions in the skeletal muscle.",

SCCs showed continuous TGFbetaR1 expression, stronger p-SMAD2/3 expression and less frequent kras mutations. In tumors at sun-exposed sites stronger TGFbetaR1 expression was noted. One SCC showed tgfbetaR1 mutation, but no other mutations were found.Although tgfbetaR1 germline mutations cause inherited KAs and our finding of strong discontinuous membranous expression in KAs suggests accumulation of functionally altered protein, we found no tgfbetaR1 mutations or influence on TGFbeta-signaling, but frequent kras mutations in this subgroup of KAs. Characteristic TGFbetaR1 expression pattern in KA can facilitate histopathologic distinction from SCC.",

Data on MTD on VIS (either mammogram, or ultrasound, or MRI), NCB and EXC were analyzed. Mean MTD on VIS was 12.5\u00a0mm (range: 0\u201345\u00a0mm). Mean MTD on NCB was 6.7\u00a0mm (range: 1\u201315\u00a0mm). Mean residual MTD on EXB was 12.9\u00a0mm (range: 0\u201340\u00a0mm). Mean number of NCB performed per SIC was 5 (range: 1\u201313). Overall, 81% of all NCB were involved by SIC. The difference between MTD at EXC and VIS was statistically not significant (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). Spearman correlation coefficient for MTD on VIS and EXC was r\u00a0=\u00a00.8718 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) showing a significant correlation. The mean tissue volume procured on NCB-calculated by using Aperio whole slide scanning and NIH Image J image analysis was 95.5\u00a0mm3 (range: 4.3\u2013887.5\u00a0mm3, median: 23\u00a0mm3). A Bland\u2013Altman plot showed that MTD of \u22657\u00a0mm on EXB is a useful cut-off point predictive of (any) increase in MTD at EXB. Six of the 13 patients with MTD\u00a0<\u00a07\u00a0mm on EXB showed a decrease in size; while no patient with MTD on EXB that was \u22657\u00a0mm showed any decrease in size. (Fisher's exact test, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001, two-tailed). Overall 88% (44 out of 50 patients) of SIC showed no decrease in MTD on EXB, with an increase by \u22654\u00a0mm in size (sufficient to upstage \u201cT\u201d) in MTD of \u22657\u00a0mm on EXB in 75.6% (28 of 37 patients with MTD of \u22657\u00a0mm on EXB). 20.8% of SIC (5 of 24 patients) that were <7\u00a0mm on NCB (with a mean combined Nottingham grade score of 5 {r: 4\u20136} showed decrease in MTD at EXB.In this pilot study of SIC, (i) MTD on VIS was predictive of MTD on EXB, (ii) MTD of \u22657\u00a0mm on NCB was predictive of an increased MTD on EXB in most cases, with potential for \u201cupstaging\u201d tumors, and (iii) MTD of <7\u00a0mm on NCB was predictive of decreased MTD on EXB in 20.8% of (mostly grade I) SIC. Procured tissue volume on NCB contributed to decrease in MTD on EXB in small, low-grade carcinomas.",

Fourteen ESFT with EWSR1/Fli-1 gene fusion presented positive nuclear staining for EPR3864(2). Similarly, 5 ESFT with EWSR1/Fli-1 gene fusion presented positive staining for 9FY. We must stress that the difference between the present and previous studies may be due to the source of the anti-ERG employed, anti-ERG against C or N-terminus, protein cross-reactivity and dilution.

The knockdown of caveolin-1 in H460 and 95D cells reduced the invasive ability of the cells and the expression of phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, MMP2, and MMP9; the protein level and activity of MMP2 and MMP9 were also decreased by the inhibition of EGFR activity in H460 and 95D cells.The expression of caveolin-1 was positively correlated with an advanced pathologic stage. Thus, caveolin-1 could act as a predictor of a poor prognosis in patients with large cell lung carcinoma. In addition, the downregulation of caveolin-1 reduced both the invasive ability of tumor cells and the protein and activity levels of MMP2 and MMP9 in vitro, suggesting the involvement of EGFR/MMP signaling in this process.",

Cytoplasmic BRCA1 was associated with none of the classic histomorphological indices, except from the lymph node metastasis, with which its relation was found to be inverse (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), prolonging the RF survival of the patients (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Our findings suggest that BRCA1 protein depicts different prognostic significance, according to its subcellular distribution. Nuclear detection of the protein was associated with a worse prognosis, while the cytoplasmic one was related to fewer recurrences as a result of fewer lymph node metastases.",

Cullin1 is involved in the progression of several cancers, such as melanoma, breast cancer, and gastric cancer.To investigate the role of Cullin1 in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), we examined the expression of Cullin1 in 8-paired fresh NSCLC tissues. We then constructed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on 114 paraffin-embedded slices and evaluated the correlation between Cullin1 expression and clinicopathologic variables, as well as patients\u2019 overall survival.We found that Cullin1 was highly expressed in NSCLC tissues and significantly associated with NSCLC's histological differentiation (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), clinical stage (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010) and Ki-67 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.021). Furthermore, we showed a strong correlation between high Cullin1 expression and worse overall survival rates in NSCLC patients (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Cox regression analysis revealed that Cullin1 expression was an independent prognostic factor to predict 5-year patient outcome in NSCLC cancer (P\u00a0=\u00a00.033).These data suggested that Cullin1 might promote the progression of NSCLC and be a biotarget for NSCLC's therapy.",

     "abstract": "A problem in the management of patients with Barrett's esophagus-related pT1 esophageal adenocarcinoma is to distinguish those who should be treated conservatively (endoscopic mucosal resection and/or radiofrequency ablation) from those who require esophago-gastrectomy. Recently, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) has emerged as one of the best predictors of regional lymph node metastasis (LNM) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in pT1 EAC. However, LVI may be underestimated, both because of interobserver variability and incomplete sampling. The aim of our study was to correlate the presence of LVI, with the immunohistochemical expression of IMP3 in pT1 EAC and assess their role in further stratifying these lesions into high and low risk groups based on the potential for lymph node metastasis and poor outcome.Depth of invasion, assessed in five sublevels (m2, m3, sm1, sm2, and sm3), LVI, and expression of IMP3 were studied in 30 patients who underwent esophagogastrectomy for pT1 EAC (2001\u20132010) at Hartford Hospital, and correlated with LNM and RFS. IMP3 was considered positive when expressed in >50% of the malignant cells with an intensity of stain of 2\u20133+.Ten of 18 (55.5%) cases with IMP3 expression demonstrated LVI and 2/10 (20%) showed LNM and died of disease. In contrast, none of the 12 IMP3 negative cases showed LVI (p\u00a0<\u00a00.004; 2-tailed Fisher exact test) or had LNM/DOD.In pT1 EAC, (1) based on IMP3 expression, pT1 EAC may be divided into high risk (LVI+/IMP3+) and low risk (LVI\u2212/IMP3\u2212) categories. (2) Absence of IMP3 expression is associated with a significantly reduced risk of LVI (Negative Predictive Value: 100%). (3) Since identifying lymphovascular invasion and other morphological parameters is prone to significant inter-observer variation, IMP3 may be useful as an ancillary marker especially in these pT1 lesions in predicting their clinical behavior, the risk stratification and potentially on the type of treatment.",

These results showed that curcumin significantly increased the body weight of 6-OHDA-impaired rats (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and reversed the anhedonia in rats induced by 6-OHDA impairment (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Meanwhile, behavioral manifestations of curcumin-treated PD rats were effectively ameliorated as shown in open field test (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In addition, curcumin increased the contents of monoaminergic neurotransmitters (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01), such as dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE), in hippocampal homogenate through high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Curcumin effectively alleviated the 6-OHDA-induced hippocampal damage as observed in hematoxylin\u2013eosin (H&E) staining. Furthermore, curcumin obviously up-regulated hippocampal brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), TrkB, phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) protein expressions, respectively as shown in Western blot analysis. These findings demonstrated that curcumin mediated the neuroprotection against 6-OHDA-induced hippocampus neurons in rats, which the underlying mechanism is involved in activating BDNF/TrkB-dependent pathway for promoting neural regeneration of hippocampal tissue.",

In this study, the protein expression of N-cadherin and P-cadherin in 46 SC/ASCs and 80 ACs was measured using immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression were significantly associated with large tumor size, invasion, and lymph node metastasis of both SC/ASC and AC. In contrast, positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression were significantly associated with differentiation and TNM stage in only AC. Univariate Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression, differentiation, tumor size, TNM stage, invasion, lymph node metastasis, and surgical curability were significantly associated with overall survival in both SC/ASC and AC patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that positive N-cadherin and P-cadherin expression are independent poor-prognostic factors in both SC/ASC and AC patients.

In patients ineligible for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, azacitidine is the only treatment shown to prolong survival. However, with the availability of a growing compendium of cancer biomarkers and related drugs, analysis of relevant genetic alterations for individual MDS patients might become part of routine evaluation.Therefore and in order to cover the entire bone marrow microenvironment involved in the pathogenesis of MDS, SNP array analysis and targeted next generation sequencing (tNGS) for the mostly therapy relevant 46 onco- and tumor-suppressor genes were performed on bone marrow biopsies from 29 MDS patients.In addition to the detection of mutations known to be associated with MDS in NRAS, KRAS, MPL, NPM1, IDH1, PTPN11, APC and MET, single nucleotide variants so far unrelated to MDS in STK11 (n\u00a0=\u00a01), KDR (n\u00a0=\u00a03), ATM (n\u00a0=\u00a01) and JAK3 (n\u00a0=\u00a02) were identified.

Finally, combined genetic aberrations affecting the VEGF/VEGFR pathway were found in the majority of cases demonstrating the diversity of mutations affecting different nodes of a particular signaling network as an intrinsic feature in MDS patients.We conclude that combined SNP array analyses and tNGS can identify established and novel therapy relevant genomic aberrations in MDS patients and track them in a clinical setting for individual therapy selection.",

     "abstract": "Approximately 90% of breast cancer mortality is due to metastases that are resistant to adjuvant therapies. Thus, assessment of factors associated with clinical outcomes in patients with advanced breast cancer is of significant importance. Despite the recent improvement in early detection, between 5 and 10% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed with metastasis at initial presentation or, rarely, before the primary breast cancer has been identified. These patients typically have poorer survival outcomes compared to those who develop distant metastasis subsequently. Yet, the prognostic relevance in these patients has not been intensively explored. In this study, we analyzed breast cancer patients with distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis between 1997 and 2010 (n\u00a0=\u00a0194) to identify the clinicopathological factors significant for overall survival. By univariate analysis, race, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor status were significantly associated with overall survival, while race and ER remained independent factors in multivariate analysis. Being Caucasian and overexpressing of ER both showed a significantly decreased hazard of death (P\u00a0=\u00a00.015 and 0.017, respectively). Reflecting these findings, the overall survival differed significantly between breast subtypes, with the luminal subtype and triple negative disease being associated with the longest and worst survival, respectively. Further, multi-organ involvement was associated with a worse prognosis than those with single organ metastasis, whereas no significant difference in survival was found between the different anatomic sites (bone, viscera and brain). Our findings suggest that it is predominantly the intrinsic nature of the tumor along with the genetic makeup of the patient that predicts the prognostic outcome in those patients with advanced disease at presentation.",

The morphological similarities include large glands with papillary infoldings and branching. However the distinguishing features are crowded glands, nuclear enlargement, occasional to frequent nucleoli and abundant pink intraluminal secretions and crystals. There can be large glands with straight luminal borders. These tumors are not only difficult to diagnose but they are also difficult to grade as Gleason scoring system does not account for this histologic pattern. Some of these tumors have shown extraprostatic extension and it has been recommended that pseudohyperplastic adenocarcinoma should not be regarded as a low grade cancer. This is a case report of prostatic adenocarcinoma with pseudohyperplastic pattern and signet ring cells in the glandular epithelium mimicking colonic hyperplastic polyp. In addition there is an associated pattern of high grade foamy gland carcinoma and occasional signet ring cells in the stroma. This combination has not been described in previous studies.",

A 2 month-old, term male neonate (37 weeks, 4 days), weighing 3.2\u00a0kg, born to a 24 year-old primigravida, by simple vaginal delivery presented with multiple erythematous papulonodular lesions over his trunk that progressed to his whole body, on the first day of delivery. Prior to conception, his mother was treated for polycystic ovarian disease. On the tenth day, his chest computed tomogram scans revealed multiple, heterogeneously enhancing, bilateral pleural-based soft tissue density nodular lesions, along with multiple soft tissue density lesions, involving skeletal muscles of all his body parts. Microsections from two biopsies (on 10th day and after 2 months) revealed a malignant round cell tumor with cells arranged in a diffuse, solid pattern, comprising embryonal and solid alveolar components. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were diffusely positive for desmin, myoD1 and myogenin. Diagnosis of embryonal and alveolar (mixed type) RMS was offered. Further molecular cytogenetic analysis was negative for PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR. The patient was induced on chemotherapy as per intergroup rhabdomyosarcoma study IV protocol. There was treatment response with near total remission after 8 weeks of treatment. Thereafter, new lesions started appearing that also disappeared after modification of the chemotherapy drugs. However, after 16 months, the baby died of brain metastasis. The present case forms the fourth case report of an aggressive form of a congenital RMS with extensive cutaneous involvement and brain metastasis. A review of previously diagnosed cases of congenital RMSs is discussed herewith.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the cell block technique, prepared from the aspiration of luminal contents, in the preoperative diagnosis of keratocystic odontogenic tumors (KCOT). From 135 cases of lesions aspirated and processed by the cell block technique, we selected those containing keratin. In all cases selected, histological diagnosis was based on surgical biopsy. From 20 cases containing keratin in the cytological analyses, 19 were KCOTs and one was an orthokeratinized odontogenic cyst (OOC). In all KCOT cases, we observed the presence of parakeratin, even in those with intense inflammation. In the cytological analysis of the OOC, parakeratin was not observed. In conclusion, there is strong evidence that KCOT can be confidently diagnosed preoperatively by cytological analyses of lesions punctured and processed by the cell block technique.",

The results of real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed an enhanced expression of CENP-A in osteosarcomas relative to adjacent non-tumorous bone tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. Immunohistochemically, 72 of the 123 osteosarcoma specimens (58.5%) had high expression of CENP-A. CENP-A overexpression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.002), poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016), local recurrence/lung metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), high Ki-67 index (P\u00a0=\u00a00.004), and P53 positivity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Median overall and recurrence-free survival time was significantly shorter in patients with high-CENP-A osteosarcomas than in those with low-CENP-A osteosarcomas. Multivariate analysis identified CENP-A as an independent poor prognostic factor for osteosarcoma. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that elevated CENP-A expression is significantly associated with osteosarcoma progression and has an independent prognostic value in predicting overall and recurrence-free survival for patients with osteosarcoma.",

Irrespective of the architecture, the tumors were composed of cuboidal or columnar cells with clear cytoplasm, small vesicular, round or oval nuclei, and inconspicuous nucleoli. Variably thick bundles of smooth muscle actin-positive soft tissue encircled the whole tumors, forming a continuous pseudocapsule. CCPRCC strongly expressed PAX8, CA-IX, CK7, cytokeratin 34betaE12, and vimentin, and were negative for RCC, P504s/AMACR, and TFE3. On ultrastructural examination, CCPRCC showed short microvilli, cytoplasmic interdigitations, nuclear pseudoinclusions, and stromal myofibroblasts. To the best of our knowledge, this is first comprehensive ultrastructural study of CCPRCC in the literature. The major differential diagnostic considerations are clear cell renal cell carcinoma, multilocular cystic renal cell carcinoma, papillary renal cell carcinoma with clear cell changes, and Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinoma. CCPRCC seems to have a favorable prognosis. In the current series, none of the patients had local recurrence or metastatic disease.",

However, DNA extraction from FFPE tissues is laborious, time-consuming and still remains a challenge. The aim of this study was to evaluate five protocols for DNA extraction from FFPE liver obtained from patients with HCC in order to detect Helicobacter pylori DNA.

In 17 cases (90%), the IHC-positive area was equal to or larger than the CISH-positive area.Among the histological subtypes of lung adenocarcinoma, the solid predominant subtype was distinguishable by its infrequent EGFR mutations. EGFR gene mutations preceded changes in oncogenic drive, more so than did EGFR gene number alterations during the developmental process of lung adenocarcinoma.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to develop a computer simulation evaluating microvessel density according to the Chalkley method on digital images taken from neovascular hot spots. An image analysis algorithm has been developed using ImageJ, an extensible, open source image processing and analysis software. The idea was to create a virtual Chalkley point array graticule, and to calculate Chalkley counts automatically by stepwise angular rotation of it on the superimposed images containing properly segmented microvessels. This eliminates the necessity of having the Chalkley graticule, an accessory that has to be mounted on the microscope's ocular. The proposed method is a faithful simulation of the original Chalkley counting procedure. It gives pathologists who do not have the Chalkley graticule an opportunity to evaluate microvessels quantitatively according to the basic principles underlying Chalkley counting. Evaluating microvessel densities in solid tumors is a frequent procedure in angiogenesis research. A few standard methods, including Chalkley counting, are used for the estimation of microvessel density. Several independent studies have shown that the Chalkley counting is more consistent and may provide useful data on prognosis. The obvious disadvantages lie in the facts that this method is time-consuming and requires a special hardware. Computer simulation may overcome these obstacles.",

     "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common cancers that exhibits high incidences of intrahepatic metastasis and tumor recurrence. Adenylate cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), a protein involved in the regulation of actin filaments, was recently reported to play a role in cell motility and the pathology of pancreatic cancer. In this study, we examined a potential role of CAP1 in HCC progression, and found that CAP1 was overexpressed in HCC specimens compared with adjacent noncancerous liver tissues by Western blot analysis and real-time PCR assay. Further, immunohistochemical analysis in 107 HCC specimens revealed that overexpression of CAP1 was closely correlated only with tumor metastasis, but not with other clinicopathologic parameters. Univariate and multivariate survival analyses showed that CAP1 could be an independent prognostic factor for patients\u2019 survival. In addition, immunofluorescent assay demonstrated that CAP1 was colocalized with actin in the leading edge of lamellipodium in HCC cells. Importantly, knocking-down the expression of CAP1 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting CAP1 led to impaired migration of HCC cells. Collectively, our results indicated that upregulated expression of CAP1 might contribute heavily to the metastasis of HCC.",

A total of 139 consecutively resected pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients were screened for EGFR mutations by the amplification refractory mutation system assay. For the resected specimens, histologic subtypes were sub-classified using either the 2004 WHO classification or the 2011 IASLC/ATS/ERS classification. Meanwhile, TITF-1 (thyroid transcription factor 1) and SP-A (surfactant-associated protein A) immunohistochemistry staining was also detected. The results were correlated with EGFR mutations and clinicopathological features mentioned above. Both sub-classification methods reflected differences in frequencies of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma subtypes. In summary, mixed non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) or papillary components and papillary predominant adenocarcinoma showed a higher frequency of EGFR mutations than mucinous BAC components; Also, EGFR mutations were significantly more common in tumors with TITF-1 or SP-A expressions than in those without (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026), especially the sensitivity of TITF-1 (96.9%) and the negative predictive value of TITF-1 (88.2%). Our data further showed significant genotype\u2013phenotype correlations between EGFR mutations and adenocarcinoma-related morphological and molecular characteristics, and patients with special histologic and IHC staining features might have higher EGFR mutation rates. In addition, this study, for the first time, indicated the significant relationship between SPA IHC and EGFR mutations, which needed confirmation by further research.",

Histological examination showed a biphasic tumor comprising chondroid and non-chondroid areas with a giant cell-rich lesion resembling a conventional giant cell tumor of the bone. Immunohistochemistry showed no expression of p16INK4a, VEGFR1, KDR (VEGFR2), VEGFR3, cKIT, MDM2 or CDK4. However, high expression of the tyrosine kinases PDGFRA and PDGFRB was observed.

Histologically, the prominent lymphoid follicle formation was seen in an ill-defined mass, 15\u00a0mm in size, in the pancreatic parenchyma. Duct-centered fibrotic rims were seen in the pancreatic ducts accompanied by mild fibrotic change between the follicles and obliterative phlebitis.

Cystoscopy showed multiple papillary tumors in the urinary bladder, and transurethral resection was performed. Pathological diagnosis was high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma with lamina propria invasion. The patient received six treatments with intravesical Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) therapy. Seven months after surgery, follow-up cystoscopy showed three elevated lesions in the urinary bladder, two of which were identified histologically as recurrent urothelial carcinoma. Microscopic examination of the lesion at the anterior wall revealed diffuse infiltration of medium to large histiocytoid cells in the lamina propria, many of which had distorted nuclei and nuclear grooves. Dense eosinophilic infiltration was also observed. Immunohistochemically, the histiocytoid cells were diffusely positive for S-100 and CD1a, but negative for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and melanosome-associated antigen recognized by HMB-45. Based on the histological and immunohistochemical features, we diagnosed the lesion as LCH of the urinary bladder. There was no evidence of recurrence of either bladder cancer or LCH after an 18-month follow-up. To avoid misdiagnosis, urologists and pathologists should be aware that LCH may develop in the urinary bladder after intravesical BCG therapy for bladder cancer.",

A 62-year-old postmenopausal woman was found to have endometrial thickening of her uterus. An endometrial biopsy indicated a malignant, spindle cell neoplasm. A total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy was performed. Histologic examination of the uterine specimen showed a malignant tumor consisting of irregular rudimentary vascular channels and solid small nests diffusely infiltrating to the middle of the myometrial wall. The tumor cells were epithelioid, and displayed eosinophilic cytoplasm and vesicular nuclei in some areas of the tumor. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells showed vascular differentiation; they were diffusely positive for CD31 and D2-40 but were negative for factor VIII and CD34. In the course of the procedure of differential diagnoses, we included fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis for detection of a FAM22B-YWHAE fusion gene resulting from t(10;17)(q22;p13), recently reported in a series of endometrial stromal sarcoma, and unexpectedly identified breakages at three loci, i.e. YWHAE (17p13), FAM22A (10q23) and FAM22B (10q22). Collectively, these findings suggest that abnormality in the loci of YWHAE, FAM22A and FAM22B, which are known to be associated with oncogenesis of endometrial stromal sarcoma, may contribute to the development of uterine angiosarcoma.",

The first group received clozapine orally at a dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg body weight daily for 6 weeks, while the other group received the drug vehicle only and served as the control group. At the end of the six weeks, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, as indicated by Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), were observed in the clozapine group as compared with the control group. This disturbance in glucose regulation was associated with non-significant changes in body weight, serum cortisol level, and hepatic glycogen content. The Clozapine group showed a significant increase in hepatic phosphorylase activity and in the gene expression level of hepatic glucose-6-phosphatse (G6Pase) enzymes compared to the control group. It can be concluded that clozapine-induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance occur in a manner mostly independent of weight gain, and may be attributed to an increase in hepatic phosphorylase activity and increased expression level of G6Pase.",

In contrast to the well-defined predictive factors for the hormonal therapy, there is a paucity of information on the BRCA1 deficiency breast tumor biology, particularly among African women. BRCA1 Sumoylation (UBC9) has been speculated to be involved in the ER transcription activity, BRCA1 deficiency and triple negative BC. We therefore hypothesized that UBC9, a SUMOylation marker, may have contributed to the aggressive nature of BRCA1 tumor phenotype observed in Nigerian women.This study investigated the immunoprofiles of UBC9 in tissue microarray (TMA) of 199 Nigerian women and correlated their protein expression with clinical outcome, pathological responses and the expression of other biomarkers to demonstrate the functional significance in Nigerian women.The protein expression of UBC9, as compared with other biomarkers, showed an inverse correlation with steroid hormones (ER, progesterone (PgR)), BRCA1, p27, p21 and MDM4, and a positive correlation with triple negative, basal cytokeratins (CK14 and CK5/6), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), basal-like breast cancer phenotype, p53, phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3KCA), placental cadherin, (P-cadherin) and BRCA1 regulators (metastasis tumor antigen-1 (MTA1). Survival analysis showed that those tumors positive for UBC9 expression had a significantly poorer breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) as compared with those showing negative expression. UBC9 remained an independent predictor of outcome for BCSS.This study demonstrates that UBC9 appears to play an important role in the tumor biology of Nigerian women. Therefore, a novel UBC9 targeted therapy in black women with BC could enhance a better patient outcome.",

We found that in 7 cases with FIGSC, the percentage of global sclerosis was higher than 50% with mild or moderate tubulointerstitial lesions, and most cases showed sclerotic regions distributed both beneath the renal capsule and in the deep cortex. Fourteen cases of afferent arterioles sclerosis were observed. Fourteen did not evolve to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) during the follow-up period.

Survivin expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in 104 tissue specimens of PTC, confirmed by Western blot and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. Of the tumors examined, 74 (71.15%) showed high cytoplasmic survivin expression. There was no association between high survivin expression and age, gender or tumor size. On the other hand, it was closely correlated with the presence of lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009), and there was a tendency for correlation with extrathyroidal invasion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.062). The high risk PTC group (TNM stage III\u2013IV) was associated with high levels of survivin (P\u00a0=\u00a00.027). These results indicate that survivin is an unfavorable molecule for PTC prognosis, and that its high expression may indicate a subset of PTC patients with a more aggressive disease course.

The goals of this study were to analyze the clinicopathological features of this disease and to explore new features for differential diagnosis. The patient series included three women and two men. All tumors were located in the left atrium without invasion of the adjacent myocardium. Patients presented with cardiac-related or embolization symptoms. Histologically, neoplasms consisted of well-formed glandular structures and typical myxoma areas. No nuclear atypia, mitosis, or necrosis was identified in the glandular structures. Glandular lining cells were strongly positive for pan-cytokeratin, epithelial membrane antigen, CAM5.2 and cytokeratin 7, but were negative for some organ-specific markers, such as thyroid transcription factor-1, calretinin, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, gross cystic disease fluid protein, prostate-specific antigen, prostate-specific acid phosphatase, cytokeratin 20 and caudal type homeobox 2. In conclusion, glandular cardiac myxoma is a rare disease which shows characteristics similar to those of classical cardiac myxoma. Because of its rarity, glandular cardiac myxoma must be distinguished from adenocarcinoma metastatic to the heart. The combination of histopathological features and immunohistochemical profiles should improve the diagnostic accuracy of glandular cardiac myxoma.",

This might alter dimensions and assessment of spread of the tumor and thus lead to a lesser tumor classification and stage. In cases where the decision for adjuvant chemoradiation is based upon the stage, it may thus be of relevance for the patient to evaluate the pathologic and not the in vivo dimensions of the tumor.In order to obtain comparable tissues, we investigated 100 palatal tonsils after cold steel dissection tonsillectomy for chronic tonsillitis.There were four time points investigated: directly after excision in the operating room and after four, 24 and 72\u00a0h of fixation in formaldehyde (4% Formaldehyde in phosphate buffer pH 7.4). The tissue was measured in the following dimensions: volume (ml), weight (g) and length, broadness and width (mm).The tissue size did not change significantly in dimensions except for an increase in length. The time of fixation did not influence the size.Formalin fixation does not significantly influence the tissue dimensions of palatal tonsils in comparison to direct ex vivo measurements. A minimal time of fixation of 20\u00a0h is required in order to stop all degenerative processes; however, longer fixation does not change the dimensions of the specimen.The null hypothesis has to be withdrawn that tissue dimensions are altered by formalin fixation. Thus, the histopathological measurements do not influence TNM staging.",

A unique pattern of reduced INI1 expression in a SS is useful during triage of some cases for molecular testing. Its expression should be interpreted in the tumor cells, rather than intermixed stromal cells and or inflammatory cells that retain INI1 expression.",

Recent studies indicate that in tumor cells, FOXP3 plays an important role in tumor development in addition to its well-established Treg function in the immune system. We investigated tumoral FOXP3 expression in breast carcinoma, and the relationships between tumoral FOXP3 expression and p53, HER-2/ErbB2, Ki67, infiltrated Tregs, and other clinicopathological variables. Tissue samples from 272 cases of breast carcinoma were used. We assessed tumoral FOXP3, p53, HER-2/ErbB2, Ki67, and infiltrated Tregs using immunohistochemical staining. Positive expression of tumoral FOXP3 was observed in 38.6% (105/272) of breast carcinomas. Positive tumoral FOXP3 expression was significantly related with positive p53 and higher Ki67 expression. Higher histological grade was significantly correlated to increased tumoral FOXP3 expression. Tumoral FOXP3 expression was positively correlated with infiltrated FOXP3-expressing Tregs. From these data, we argue that tumoral FOXP3 has a potential oncogenic function in conjunction with the p53 tumor suppressor protein and infiltrated Tregs in human breast carcinomas.",

     "abstract": "FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an important role in the maintenance of tumor immunity tolerance. Compared with conventional myeloid dentritic cells (mDCs), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) exhibit poor immunostimulatory ability, and their interaction with T cells often promotes the development of Tregs. The aim of this study was to determine FOXP3+ Tregs and CD123+pDCs infiltration in colorectal cancer and tumor draining lymph node (TDLN), and to evaluate the clinical significance and relationship between pDCs infiltration and Tregs development in the CRC tolerogenic milieu. An immunohistochemical assay was conducted to assess FOXP3+Tregs and CD123+pDCs infiltration in tumor tissue and in metastatic-free TDLN (mfTDLN) and metastatic TDLN (mTDLN). The results showed that FOXP3+ Tregs infiltration was more frequent in tumor tissue than in adjacent normal mucosa (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). FOXP3+Tregs infiltration was associated with advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and P\u00a0<\u00a00.01 for TNM stage and lymph node metastasis, respectively). Different from FOXP3+Tregs, CD123+pDCs frequencies were lower in most CRC tumor tissues, whereas the positive rate of CD123 expression in CRC was significantly higher than in adjacent normal mucosa tissue (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). Compared to mfTDLN, mTDLN was significantly enriched in FOXP3+ Tregs (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and increased in pDC/mDC ratio (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The statistical analysis demonstrated a significant correlation in both Tregs and pDC/mDC ratio in mTDLN. These results suggest that there are more FOXP3+ Tregs with a stronger prognostic significance which might promote tumor tolerance, and that CD123+pDCs might contribute to Tregs development in the CRC tolerogenic milieu.",

Three potential reference genes for pulmonary tumors with neuroendocrine differentiation were included and tested for their robust expression.Eighty specimens collected from 2005 to 2012 at the Institute of Pathology and Neuropathology at the University Hospital Essen were analyzed for their gene expression by using TaqMan\u00ae gene expression assays on demand (AoD). Three distinct potential reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, HPRT1) were evaluated for their expression, and a proteasome subunit (PSMA1) was included in the analysis as tumor marker and functioned as an internal technical control.For GAPDH and ACTB, a highly significant correlation and consistent expression between the investigated entities was found, making them reliable reference genes for further research. Additionally, the feasibility for a FFPE tissue-based gene expression analysis was verified by showing that the mRNA quality is sufficient. When standardized FFPE preparation is performed carefully, sufficient mRNA can be isolated for reliable and successful gene expression analysis. That provides the basis the door for large, retrospective studies that correlate molecular and clinical follow-up data.",

Previous studies have demonstrated overexpression of steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) in many cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, thyroid cancer, functioning in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and metastasis. However, so far, the expression and function of SRC-3 in bone cancers have not yet been clarified. In this study, nickel-intensified immunohistochemistry was conducted using a commercial tissue microarray (with 94 cases of bone cancer tissue and 10 normal bone tissues), and the 4-scoring system was employed to evaluate the expression levels of SRC-3 immunoreactivity. The results showed that in normal bone tissue, levels of SRC-3 are almost negative (score\u00a0=\u00a00), the total positivity (score\u00a0=\u00a01\u20133) of SRC-3 immunoreactivities in bone cancers was 74.47%. There were no significant differences in gender, status (malignant or benign) or (mean) age (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). The percentage of positivity was 77.78% in osteogenic tumors, 58.82% in cartilage tumors, 70% in giant cell tumors, 100% in hematopoietic tumors, 77.78% in miscellaneous lesions, and 75% in miscellaneous tumors. Age related differences of SRC-3 immunoreactivities were detected in cartilage tumors and giant cell tumors (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The above results clearly demonstrated a high frequency of overexpression of SRC-3 immunoreactivities in different bone cancers, indicating its potential roles in the prognosis and treatment of these cancers.",

Here, we report a case of an intracystic apocrine papillary tumor in the breast of a 49-year-old woman. Histopathologic examination revealed that the entire papillary structures and cyst wall were comprised of apocrine cells, some of which showed nuclear atypia with macronucleoli. Immunohistochemical examination revealed a lack of myoepithelial cells in the papillary fronds and cyst wall. Although the dense proliferation of apocrine cells mimicked a cribriform pattern, detailed examination identified a delicately intermingled interstitium in the cribriform-like growth area in the present case. We judged the current case to be benign apocrine papilloma. Only a few apocrine variants of IPC or EPC have been reported to be malignant or potentially malignant. Since even benign apocrine lesions are known to lack myoepithelial cells, histopathologic evaluation regarding malignant potential requires caution in apocrine variants.

The aim of this study was to evaluate GLTSCR2 expression in breast cancer and to investigate the question of whether reduced expression of GLTSCR2 may have any pathological significance in breast cancer development or progression. In this study, we performed quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of GLTSCR2 and relevance with clinicopathological factors in the invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). GLTSCR2 expression was reduced in 48% of IDC (n\u00a0=\u00a0426) by a semi-quantitative scoring system using tissue microarray. GLTSCR2 mRNA was significantly reduced by 0.16 fold in 15 out of 17 (88%) cases of IDC.

No FoxO3a expression was detected in patients with mantle cell lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a03), extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a03), mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a01), NK/T cell lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a05), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n\u00a0=\u00a02), or T-lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (n\u00a0=\u00a02). These results suggest that FoxO3a is expressed mostly in patients with HL, but not in patients with non-HL. FoxO3a expression was limited to a small number of Hodgkin cells in a quiescent state. FoxO3a may be a CIC marker of HL, but not of non-HL.",

Of invasive SCC, 66% (50/76) expressed at least one CT antigen, most commonly MAGE-A (47%). Among the biopsies, only 1 of 55 squamous papillomas was CT-positive, whereas 8 of 65 (12%) squamous dysplasia lesions were CT-positive. These 8 CT-positive biopsies were from 6 patients, 3 of which had concurrent or subsequent SCC. CT antigens are frequently expressed in head and neck SCC; however, there was no difference in the clinicopathological characteristics or behavior of CT-positive tumors compared to CT-negative tumors. The usefulness of CT antigens as positive predictors for SCC in squamous dysplasia biopsies remains to be determined by long-term follow-up in larger cohorts.",

Transmission electron tomography offers the ability to gather three-dimensional information with relative ease.

     "abstract": "Senescence, an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest, maintains metabolic activity. Although being a barrier against tumor development, senescence could also promote tumor progression by influencing the microenvironment. Necrosis is a common feature of various malignant tumors, which also has two opposing effects: pro-tumor by chronic inflammation and anti-tumor by effective cell clearance. However, the role of senescence in melanoma and whether it is associated with necrosis remain unclear. By detecting senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and pimonidazole (hypoxia probe), we found that senescent cells (SA-\u03b2-gal positive) are mainly located around the necrotic/hypoxic areas of melanoma from C57BL/6J mice. Moreover, treatment of hypoxia induced irreversibly cellular senescence in vitro. In addition, the senescent cells may facilitate microenvironment modulation and promote the invasion of melanoma cells by secreting matrix metalloproteinase-2(MMP-2). Moreover, Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that the presence of necrosis in melanomas had an inverse correlation with patient survival and may serve as an independent prognostic marker. Therefore, hypoxic stress imposed on melanomas may lead to cellular senescence surrounding necrotic areas, and the adverse effects of necrosis in tumor may be attributed to the adjacent senescent cells with senescence-associated secretion phenotype (SASP), including secretion of MMP-2.",

RCXC is distinguished from CDC and UC of the renal pelvis as having the tumor epicenter in the renal calyx, with limited involvement of the surrounding renal pelvis surface urothelium. In this study, we summarize our experience with this entity.Ten cases of RCXC, including 9 cases with urothelial differentiation (RCXC-UC) and 1 case with salivary gland-type differentiation (RCXC-SC), were identified. Ten consecutive cases of UC were selected for comparison, with extensive renal pelvis involvement and with secondary renal parenchymal invasion. Two cases of collecting duct carcinoma (CDC) were also examined. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on representative tissue blocks for PAX8, PAX2, CK5, CK7, CK20, p63, GATA3, AMACR, RCC, CD10, vimentin, S100, and MSA.The 10 cases of RCXC (M:F\u00a0=\u00a04:6, ages: 62\u201391 years, mean: 76) presented with renal masses of 3\u20136\u00a0cm. Ureteroscopic studies and renal pelvic washings showed atypical/malignant cells in three cases. Seven patients were treated with nephrectomy followed by radiation\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0chemotherapy, and all cases developed metastases to lymph nodes or liver/lung/bone.In all 7 cases with nephrectomy, there was extensive renal parenchymal involvement with infiltrating borders and diffuse spread along collecting ducts. Six RCXC-UC contained focal squamous differentiation. The RCXC-SC displayed features of adenoid cystic and basaloid features. In situ UC, with or without papillary components, was identified in the calyces in all 7 nephrectomy cases with remaining renal pelvis harboring small tumor burden in 5 cases, and no tumor in another 2 cases. Of the three cases without nephrectomy, no tumor in the renal pelvis could be visualized with endoscopy, however one case was associated with UC of the urinary bladder. Of 10 control UC cases, tumor was limited to the tip of renal papilla in 7 cases, extensive in 3 cases, and with no extension into the collecting ducts. RCXC-UC were all positive for p63, CK5, CK7, and PAX2, with all negative for RCC. PAX8 (70% positive) and GATA3 (50% positive) reactivity was variable. The 10 UC cases shared IHC properties with RCXC-UC but frequent negativity for PAX8 and positivity for GATA3.RCXC is an aggressive neoplasm with high risk of metastases. Similar to CDC, it is located in the renal papilla and rarely with clinically visible renal pelvis tumor or ureteral urine positive for tumor cells. Unlike CDC and non-calyceal UC, RCXC shows predominantly urothelial and squamous differentiation and is associated with an in situ component of adjacent renal calyces. By IHC, RCXC exhibited features intermediate between UC and CDC with decreased or negative immunoreactivity for PAX8 and GATA.",

Clinicians first interpreted it as branchial cleft cyst, and a cystectomy was performed. Gross examination revealed a unilocular cystic lesion filled with yellowish clear fluids, containing a markedly thinned fibrous wall with smooth inner surface, partly coexisting with tiny solid and papillary-like components. On microscopic examination, the cystic tumor was lined by mono-layered ciliated columnar or metaplastic stratified squamous epithelium with underlying ectopic thyroid follicles or lymphocytic infiltrate, reminiscent of thyroglossal duct cyst (TDC), partly adjacent to the compressed lymph node tissue. Its solid parts were composed of a proliferation of atypical cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells with occasional nuclear grooves or intranuclear inclusions, arranged in a papillary growth pattern with supporting delicate fibrovascular cores.

Systematic comprehensive genetic analyses on medulloblastomas are rare but necessary to provide more detailed information.Therefore, we performed comprehensive cytogenetic analyses (blood and tissue) of two pediatric and one adult medulloblastoma, using trypsin-Giemsa staining, spectral karyotyping (tissues only), SNP-arrays, and gene expression analyses.We confirmed frequently detected chromosomal aberrations in medulloblastoma, such as +7q, \u22128p/q, \u22129q, \u221211q, \u221212q, and +17q and identified novel genetic events. Applying SNP-array, we identified constitutional de novo losses 5q21.1, 15q11.2, 17q21.31, 19p12 (pediatric medulloblastoma), 9p21.1, 19p12, 19q13.3, 21q11.2 (adult medulloblastoma) and gains 16p11.1\u201316p11.2, 18p11.32, Yq11.223\u2013Yq11.23 (pediatric medulloblastoma), Xp22.31 (adult medulloblastoma) possibly representing inherited causal events for medulloblastoma formation.

Focal amplification was noted in only 2 cases by FISH. The HER2 status of our gastric cancer file is 17.2% by FISH, 20.4% by SISH. The concordance between HercepTest\u2122/A0485 IHC and ISH is perfect in (+++) cases. Equivocal results (++) with any IHC method should be clarified by one of the molecular methods (SISH and FISH). Probably up to the higher level of heterogeneity of gastric carcinomas, there is a 4.5% dilemma of cases that are negative or weakly positive by conventional IHC methods. Therefore, regarding HER2 status in gastric carcinoma, the reliability of IHC methods should be checked.",

In this study, we aimed to determine whether ALDH1 expression in axillary lymph node metastases (ALNM) of breast cancer patients was also associated with poor prognosis. Expression of ALDH1, ER, PgR, HER2 and KI-67 was examined in primary tumors and ALNM of 161 patients with invasive breast cancer. Survival analysis and multivariate analysis were used to determine the relationship between ALDH1 expression and clinical prognosis. Patients with positive ALDH1 expression in primary tumors and in ALNM had significantly shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) times and overall survival (OS) times compared to those whose tissues were ALDH1 negative. ALDH1-positivity in primary tumors was significant both in univariate and multivariate analyses of RFS and OS. ALDH1 expression in ALNM was significant in a univariate analysis of RFS and OS but not in a multivariate analysis of RFS and OS. We conclude that the expression of ALDH1 in primary breast tumors or ALNM may be one potential risk factor for poor, long-term outcomes.",

Hepatoblastomas with a poorly differentiated epithelial component had a higher incidence of CK19 and Oct-3/4 expression than those with a well differentiated epithelial component (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005 and 0.037, respectively). Higher disease stage of hepatoblastoma was correlated with CK19 expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.043). Oct-3/4-positive hepatoblastomas were associated with short disease-free survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.035). Both hepatoblastomas and childhood HCCs, therefore, exhibit characteristics of HPCs, and the poor prognosis of patients with Oct-3/4-positive hepatoblastoma suggests that stem-like properties affect hepatoblastoma pathogenicity.",

A review of 227 patients who had undergone surgical resection for pulmonary NETs revealed 2 tumors with different mechanisms of nuclear inclusion. To explore the cause of nuclear inclusion, NET with nuclear inclusion was characterized immunohistochemically and ultrastructurally. Nuclear inclusions were observed in 2 of the 227 (0.9%) patients with pulmonary NETs. The first patient was a 46-year-old woman with small cell carcinoma. Tumor cells with nuclear inclusions were distributed focally. Ultrastructural analysis showed that these inclusions were pseudoinclusions. The second patient was a 62-year-old man with large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. Nuclear inclusions were observed in the focal area of the tumor. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the intra-nuclear materials consisted of biotin and aberrant cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of \u03b2-catenin. Mutational analysis revealed a CTNNB1 gene mutation. Although very rare, diagnostic errors may be observed in cases of pulmonary NETs with nuclear inclusions. The mechanisms of nuclear inclusion differed, with one due to herniation of the cytoplasm into the nucleus (pseudoinclusion) and the other due to accumulation of biotin resulting from a CTNNB1 gene mutation.",

The clinical data were collected from the hospital information system. The microscopic findings of adenocarcinoma and DIPNECH were reviewed. A panel of neuroendocrine and epithelial markers was analyzed immunohistochemically. In addition, the H&E slides of a series of 82 lung carcinomas were reevaluated for the presence of DIPNECH foci and the parameters of the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification for lung adenocarcinoma.DIPNECH foci were composed of small intramucosal nests of proliferating pulmonary neuroendocrine cells alongside or at the periphery of terminal airways. All detected foci measured less than 5\u00a0mm in maximal diameter and showed a consistent reactivity against Synaptophysin. They did not express epithelial markers of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. In three cases, the DIPNECH foci were clearly associated with the adenocarcinoma, while in one case, they were observed in the non-neoplastic lung tissue. The adenocarcinoma with DIPNECH inside mainly showed low grade histology, while the fourth case was intermediate to high grade. The histologic evaluation of the HE slides of the other 82 lung cancer cases showed no suspected or definite DIPNECH foci. Within this series, we could confirm the prognostic significance of the IASLC/ATS/ERS classification of lung adenocarcinoma.Our series suggest that a subset of lung adenocarcinoma is characterized by the concomitant presence of DIPNECH within the tumor, suggesting a causal relationship. These adenocarcinomas seem to be low grade ones, and may have a particular tumorigenesis and clinical behavior. These observations need to be confirmed in larger tumor collectives. We could confirm the prognostic relevance of the new adenocarcinoma classification.",

To show that findings in the mouse are relevant to human tumors and clinical outcome, we investigated the expression of signaling proteins and transcription factors involved in the regulation of INHA in human tumor samples\u22c5 Thirty-one adrenocortical tumor samples, including 13 adrenocortical carcinomas (ACCs), were categorized according to Weiss score, hormonal profile, and patient survival data and analyzed using immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR.Expression of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling mediator SMAD3 varied inversely with Weiss score, so that SMAD3 expression was lowest in the most malignant tumors. By contrast, SMAD2 expression was upregulated in most malignant tumors. Wnt pathway co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 were predominantly expressed in benign adrenocortical tumors. In ACCs, expression of transcription factors GATA-6 and SF-1 correlated with that of their target gene INHA. Moreover, the diminished expression of GATA-6 and SF-1 in ACCs correlated with poor outcome.We conclude that the factors driving INHA expression are reduced in ACCs with poor outcome, implicating a role for INHA as a tumor suppressor in humans.",

     "abstract": "Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common tumors worldwide, with a high malignant degree and poor prognosis. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) expression and the prognosis of patients with ESCC. The expression of PKM2 in 86 cases of esophageal carcinoma tissues was tested using immunohistochemistry. The relationship between PKM2 expression and clinical pathological parameters, and their effects on the prognosis of patients with ESCC were analyzed. The expression levels of PKM2 in both cytoplasm and nucleus of ESCC tissues were significantly higher than those in paracancerous tissues (P\u00a0=\u00a06.73\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22129 and 4.32\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010\u22126, respectively). The Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that nuclear PKM2 expression was closely related to the survival of patients with ESCC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Patients with high PKM2 expression in the nucleus had significantly shorter survival times than those with low PKM2 expression in the nucleus (hazard ratio for death, 2.358; 95% confidence interval, 1.156\u20134.812; P\u00a0=\u00a00.018). No other significant difference was found between PMK2 expression and clinico-pathological features of ESCC patients (all P\u00a0>\u00a00.05). In conclusion, high PKM2 expression in the nucleus is essential in the pathogenic process of ESCC and may be used to predict the prognosis of patients with ESCC.",

We tested the hypothesis that in NSCLC tissue, macrophages are the major site of LPL expression. LPL expression in the entire NSCLC tissue and in the adjacent non-cancer lung tissue was compared to the expression of genes preferentially expressed in macrophages. LPL expression at the cellular level was analyzed by mRNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. In the whole cancer tissue (but not in the adjacent non-cancer tissue), expression of LPL correlated with expression of genes preferentially expressed in macrophages (MSR1, CD163, FOLR2), but not with expression of genes preferentially expressed in tumor cells. All cells in the cancer and adjacent non-cancer tissue exhibit low LPL expression. However, in cancer tissue only, there were individual highly LPL-expressing cells which were macrophages. These LPL-overexpressing cells were approximately 10 times less abundant than anti-CD163-stained, tumor-associated macrophages. To conclude, in NSCLC tissue, a subpopulation of tumor-associated macrophages highly expresses LPL. Because tumor-associated macrophages are pro-tumorigenic, these cells should be further characterized to better understand the underlying nature of the close relationship between high LPL activity in NSCLC tissue and shorter patient survival.",

After gadolinium administration, the signal of the lesion was moderately and diffusely enhanced. The histological diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was made based on a preoperative core biopsy specimen. Microscopic examination of the resected specimen revealed an ill-defined intraosseous tumor composed of proliferated atypical and mildly pleomorphic smooth muscle cells permeating among the bone trabeculae with only focal destruction of the bone trabeculae and low mitotic activity, indicating low grade leiomyosarcoma. The bone trabeculae at the periphery of the tumor were mildly thickened and anastomosed with a rim of an increased number of osteoblasts. Systemic examination showed no tumorous lesions in other anatomical sites. Leiomyosarcomas rarely present in the bone as a diffuse intertrabecular growth, even in low grade tumors.",

This investigation aims at establishing a practical quantitative vascular image analysis solution for diagnostic pathologists by using ImageJ, and CD34 immunostain.Tissue microarray slides containing breast cancer tissue were immunostained for CD34 for simultaneous identification of lymphatic endothelial cells (LEC) and blood vessel endothelial cells (BEC). Digital images were analyzed using NIH ImageJ software. A CD34 score was quantified for each tissue core as a percentage (CD34-positive area/area of tissue core). The mean CD34 scores were 0.24%, 0.40%, 1.30%, 2.33%, 2.64%, and 3.44% for normal breast tissue, in stage IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC breast cancer tissue cores, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The mean CD34 scores were 0.70% and 2.21% for lymph node-negative and lymph node-positive breast cancer patients, respectively (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).ImageJ software seems to be an attractive quantitative image analysis tool for diagnostic pathology for immunohistochemistry-based applications because of its capabilities, availability, and ease of use with most image formats. Our results show the feasibility, versatility, and ease of use of ImageJ and CD34 immunohistochemistry for vascular image analysis in breast pathology. Given the prospects of novel lymphatic and vascular endothelium-targeting therapeutics in breast oncology, the practical analysis of combined LEC and BEC density described in this report could enable diagnostic pathologists to apply quantitative vascular image analysis easily in their pathology practice and translational research.",

We analyzed the immunohistochemical expression of ERCC1 in a tissue microarray from 135 primary breast carcinomas and correlated the immunohistochemical findings with clinicopathological factors and outcome data. ERCC1 expression analysis was available for 109 cases. In this group, 58 (53.2%) were positive for ERCC1. ERCC1-positive expression was correlated with smaller tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007) and with positivity for estrogen receptor (P\u00a0=\u00a00.040), but no correlation was found with other clinicopathological features. Although not statistically significant, triple negative breast cancers were more frequently negative for ERCC1 (61.5% of the cases) compared to the non-triple negative breast cancer cases (41.5%). In conclusion, ERCC1 expression correlated significantly with favorable prognostic factors, such as smaller tumor size and ER-positivity, suggesting a possible role for ERCC1 as a predictive and/or prognostic marker in breast cancer.",

Two hundred and eight (208) specimens of surgically resected NSCLC were stained by immunohistochemistry utilizing mouse anti-human HAb18G/CD147 monoclonal antibody. High levels of HAb18G/CD147 expression were associated with male gender, smoking history, tumor position, distant metastasis status, and clinical stage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in squamous cell carcinoma. In adenocarcinomas, HAb18G/CD147 expression was associated with male gender, tumor diameter, differentiation, lymph node status, distant metastasis status, and clinical stage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). HAb18G/CD147 expression with higher PU was predominantly localized in the tumor cell membranes rather than in cytoplasms. In squamous cell carcinomas, membranous localization of HAb18G/CD147 was linked to distant metastasis status and TNM stage (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Cytoplasmic localization of HAb18G/CD147 was associated with male gender and smoking history. In adenocarcinomas, membranous localization of HAb18G/CD147 correlated with tumor diameter, differentiation and distant metastasis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Univariate analysis indicated that patients with high HAb18G/CD147 expression and membranous localization predicted poor prognosis in both squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas.

FOXQ1 expression was then evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) using tissue microarray. Finally, we analyzed FOXQ1 expression and clinicopathological factors in 114 HCC patients using SPSS 20.0 software. FOXQ1 expression at the transcriptional level in HCC cells was much higher than in the noncancerous cells (P\u00a0=\u00a00.012, respectively). Comparison of clinicopathological characteristics and FOXQ1 expression in HCC by IHC and \u03c72 tests showed that high FOXQ1 expression was linked to large tumor diameter, high serum \u03b1-fetoprotein levels and later stage grouping with tumor node metastasis classification. Kaplan\u2013Meier and Cox regression analyses showed that high FOXQ1 expression and regional lymph node metastasis were independent prognostic factors. Our study demonstrates that an aggressive malignant phenotype of HCC is strongly linked to high FOXQ1 expression, and FOXQ1 may be a novel target in HCC therapy. Furthermore, it is likely that FOXQ1 is an oncogene in HCC.",

We applied the Universal grading system suggested by Shimizu/Silverberg and noted FIGO-stage, histotype, tumor size, bilaterality, and endometriosis. These features were compared with each other and survival. The survival analysis was carried out by Kaplan\u2013Meier curves.

FIGO-stage and mitotic count were significant for survivals of 59 patients with cancer. Mitotic index was also significant for the probability of metastasis. The patients with stage-II cancer had 5.65 times more risk of recurrence than stage-I cancer. The 5-year overall and disease-free survivals rates were 90.6% and 87.5% for stage-I, 54.7% and 39.3% for stage-II, respectively. Universal grade did not reach statistical significance for survivals but it was related to FIGO-stage significantly. In conclusion, FIGO-stage is the most reliable prognosticator. Although prognostic value of universal grade is not significant, mitotic count may provide important prognostic information for early-stage ovarian carcinomas.",

Positive SIRT1 and cortactin expression was observed in 67% (96 of 144) and 58% (84 of 144) of patients with invasive NSCLC, respectively. SIRT1 and cortactin expression was significantly associated with unfavorable clinicopathological factors, including high pathological T stage, lymph node metastasis, and advanced tumor invasion (AIS vs. invasive adenocarcinoma). Cortactin was significantly associated with high pathological T stage and lymph node metastasis in SIRT1-positive tumors. Cytoplasmic SIRT1 was significantly associated with high pathological T stage and large tumor size compared to that of nuclear SIRT1. Large tumor size, high pathological T stage, lymph node metastasis, and cytoplasmic SIRT1 expression were significantly associated with shorter overall survival in a univariate analysis.

In conclusion, newly developed sensitive methods, such as the PNA-clamping method and multiplex PCR with SBE assay, are practically useful in addition to the conventional IDH1 IHC in small biopsied samples.",

     "abstract": "Collecting buccal cell DNA has a number of advantages in terms of practicality and technical quality when employed for detecting human papillomavirus (HPV), arguably an important etiological factor for head and neck carcinomas. The objective of the present study was to assess oropharyngeal mucosa brushing as an effective method for collecting DNA samples and for detecting HPV. Forty-three female patients diagnosed with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and 21 of their spouses, both groups without clinically detectable oral lesions, were submitted to quantitative and qualitative DNA analysis obtained through buccal cell brushing, with spectrophotometry assessment and beta-globin PCR. DNA samples were also checked for the presence of HPV. Efficient collection of DNA was achieved in all the sample cases. Two samples, a male and a female (not sexual partners), showed HPV-positivity. The results revealed that the oral brushing technique is an effective method for DNA collection to detect HPV, confirming that it could usefully contribute to epidemiological studies undertaken in Brazil's Public Health System. HPV detection using PCR showed that only 3.12% of the cases were HPV-positive. Although the sample was small, our study nevertheless allowed the detection of HPV in DNA samples of oral biological material.",

Blood and tissue samples were collected after the sacrifice. Levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured by using the thiobarbituric acid method. Total antioxidant status (TAS) was determined using a commercially available ImAnOx kit. A histopathological evaluation was accomplished by scoring the degree of severity. Endothelial damage of the main pulmonary artery was evaluated by immunohistochemical labeling of endothelial cells using anti-rat endothelial cell antigen 1 (RECA-1) antibody. MCT-induced right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) was reduced significantly in the MCT\u00a0+\u00a0PDTC-treated group. MDA levels were significantly lowered in the MCT\u00a0+\u00a0PDTC-treated group. TAS was significantly higher in the MCT\u00a0+\u00a0PDTC-treated group when compared with the rats with PAH. Histopathological examination demonstrated that PDTC treatment reduced the development of inflammation, hemorrhage and congestion, and collagen deposition. In conclusion, PDTC attenuated PAH and protected pulmonary endothelium in rats administered MCT. These findings suggest that PDTC treatment may provide a new effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of PAH.",

Each set of probes is composed of differentially labeled DNA fragments complementary to sequences proximal or distal to the break point within the SSX1/SSX4 or SSX2 locus, which are applied separately to histopathological sections. Interphase nuclei containing a translocation that disrupts either SSX1, SSX2, or SSX4 locus will display two single-color signals that have \u201cbroken apart\u201d from each other. We applied it to two synovial sarcoma cell lines and clinical samples. This assay can detect translocation at either SSX1/SSX4, or SSX2 locus on interphase spread prepared from synovial sarcoma cell line and histopathological sections, which is sufficient to diagnose as synovial sarcoma. Our new FISH assay has several advantages, including its applicability to paraffin-embedded samples, discrimination of the SS18\u2013SSX1 and SS18\u2013SSX2 translocations particularly in cases with aneuploidy, and potentially detecting translocations in all cases of synovial sarcoma, even with variant translocations.

The aim was to investigate the clinicopathological features of UD-EGC in ER specimens, diagnosed as differentiated histology based on biopsy. 289 patients with EGC were treated by ER. Among them, 13.1% were diagnosed as UD-EGC after ER, and 18.4% of them showed differentiated histology based on biopsy before ER. We analyzed UD-EGC with differentiated histology (D-group) compared to undifferentiated histology (UD-group) on biopsy. The D-group showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma on biopsy and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in ER specimens. The D-group was significantly associated with older age, intestinal metaplasia in the surrounding mucosa, and larger size than the UD-group. Gland portion of tumor, mixed-type Lauren classification, submucosal invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion were more common in the D-group than in the UD-group. The number of biopsies was not different between the groups. When comparing the histopathological mapping findings and endoscopic appearances of the D-group, the zone of transition from differentiated to undifferentiated histology was frequently found on one or two peripheral sides of the lesion. In conclusion, areas of EGC greater than 20\u00a0mm with moderately differentiated histology on biopsy may contain an undifferentiated component. UD-EGC with differentiated histology on biopsy may show more aggressive behavior than UD-EGC, consistent with the biopsy pathology. Biopsy at several peripheral sides of the lesion may be helpful for diagnosis of UD histology before treatment.",

We could additionally analyze clinical data of 157 CHL cases (including 28 LD cases) and the immunophenotype of 150 CHL cases (including 28 LD cases). We compared clinicopathological data between LD cases and other types of CHL cases and determined prognostic factors by univariate and multivariate analysis. LD showed a more progressive disease stage (stage 3/4, 64%) than other types of CHL (stage 3/4, 30%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), more frequent B symptoms (89% vs. 40%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and extranodal invasion (50% vs. 11%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), older age (median: 66 vs. 33; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), higher serum soluble interleukin 2 receptor levels (median: 8240\u00a0U/ml vs. 1705\u00a0U/ml; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and much poorer prognosis regardless of the international prognostic score (IPS) (five-year overall survival: 29% vs. 86%; P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The morphological subtype of LD represented an independent prognostic factor as did age and IPS by multivariate analysis.

Recent studies have pointed to deregulation of autophagy as a novel pathogenesis of human malignancy. SM22 is considered as a tumor suppressor. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the correlation of the SM22 expression level with the autophagy activity and the clinical characteristics in human CRC tissues. The expressions of SM22 and p62, a biomarker of autophagy activity, in paired tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues from 43 patients with colorectal cancer were detected by western blot and immunohistochemical staining, respectively. The results showed that the SM22 level decreased significantly in 81.4% CRC tissues, while the expression of p62 increased in 79.1% cases. There was a negative correlation between p62 and SM22 expressions in colorectal cancer tissues (p\u00a0=\u00a00.004). Similarly, the negative correlation between SM22 and p62 was verified in human CRC cell lines. The data suggest that the autophagy activity decreased in human CRC, which was associated with reduction in SM22 expression. However, the expression of SM22 was not associated with the gender, tumor site and Duke's stage of the patients. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the disruption of SM22 may be involved in tumorigenesis in CRC.

     "abstract": "This report describes the morphological features of a pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma with focal trophoblastic differentiation of the urinary bladder in a male, 12 years post living related donor renal transplant. The voided urine cytology demonstrated rare decoy cells admixed with markedly atypical urothelial cell clusters, papillae and giant cells. Cystoprostatectomy demonstrated a nodular mass involving the trigone and right lateral-posterior wall, adjacent to the ureteral orifice. Hematoxylin-eosin stained sections showed two synchronous malignancies: (a) pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma with focal trophoblastic differentiation of the urinary bladder, metastatic to the omentum and (b) prostatic adenocarcinoma, Gleason score 3\u00a0+\u00a04\u00a0=\u00a07, involving the right prostate lobe. Strong diffuse expression of polyomavirus large T antigen was demonstrated in the primary and metastatic pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma, supporting a possible role for polyomavirus (BK) in the oncogenetic pathway. The prostatic adenocarcinoma was negative for polyomavirus large T antigen. Our findings of p63, CK7 and CK903 expression in pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma suggest that the tumor is of urothelial derivation. This is the first report describing the morphological features of urinary bladder pleomorphic giant cell carcinoma with trophoblastic differentiation, positive for polyomavirus large T antigen, arising in the background of BKV reactivation.",

We report on two additional examples of an analogous phenomenon encountered in male patients, aged 59 years (Case 1) and 91 years (Case 2). Both tumors were intra- and suprasellar masses, measuring 5.6\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04.4\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.4\u00a0cm, and 2.7\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.7\u00a0cm, respectively. Histologically, Case 1 was an FSH-cell adenoma interwoven by vascularized connective tissue septa that tended to exhibit incremental stages of adventitial overgrowth. The epithelial component of Case 2 corresponded to an LH-cell adenoma, and lay partitioned by a maze of paucicellular to hyalinized vascular axes. Irrespective of architectural variations, perivascular spindle cells exhibited immunopositivity for vimentin, muscular actin, and smooth muscle actin. Conversely, negative results were obtained for CD34, EMA, S100 protein, GFAP, and TTF-1. Ultrastructural study failed to reveal metaplastic cell forms involving transitional features between adenohypophyseal\u2013epithelial and mesenchymal\u2013contractile phenotype. We propose that LANT be regarded as a peculiar reflection of maladaptive angiogenesis in some pituitary adenomas, rather than a genuine hybrid neoplasm. While no mechanistic clue is forthcoming to account for this distinctive pattern, hemodynamic strain through direct arterial \u2013 rather than portal \u2013 supply of the adenoma's capillary bed may be one such explanatory factor. The apparent predilection of the LANT pattern for macroadenomas of the gonadotroph cell lineage remains unexplained.",

Because most of autopsy cases underwent clinical treatment, arterial fibrinoid necrosis, which is the most specific finding of cPN, is often obscure. The aim of this study was to seek morphological characteristics of the middle-sized arteries in autopsy cases of cPN, and to identify immunohistochemical markers for the diagnosis of cPN. Nineteen patients who had undergone autopsy with a diagnosis of cPN were enrolled. Twenty-one autopsy cases without cPN were examined as control group. Arterial fibrinoid necrosis in medium-sized arteries was observed in 8/19 autopsy cases. Elastica van Gieson staining showed an increased number of elastic fiber layers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and greater distances between elastic fiber layers (P\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) in the renal middle-sized arteries of the cPN group. These findings probably reflected the post-inflammatory remodeling process after necrotizing vasculitis. On immunohistochemical examination, the cPN group showed high matrix metalloproteinase-1 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 expressions and decreased smoothelin expression in the vascular wall compared to the control group. When uncertain or atypical autopsy cases of cPN are examined, these findings can help to make the pathological diagnosis of cPN.",

Microscopically, both tumors were cystic and showed tubular and cystopapillary architecture. The tumor cells had round to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm. Presence of eosinophilic material was evident within cystic spaces. Immunohistochemically, both tumors expressed cytokeratins (CK), CK7, CK8, CK18, epithelial membrane antigen, vimentin, S-100 protein, mammaglobin, and STAT5a (signal transducer and activator of transcription 5a). Interestingly, both tumors showed variable expression of basal/myoepithelial markers. In one case, we observed diffuse expression of calponin and focal expression of p63 whereas expression of CD10 was absent. In the second case, the staining of calponin was negative, but there was focal expression of both p63 and CD10. Both neoplasms harbored the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript as proved by RT-PCR. Although previously reported only rarely, we conclude that MASC may show expression of basal/myoepithelial markers.",

Immunohistochemical analysis showed that HIF-1\u03b1/HIF-2\u03b1 staining was mainly present in the nuclei of cancer cells. HIF-1\u03b1-positive cells were diffusely distributed in the nests of the tumor, while HIF-2\u03b1-positive cells were frequently distributed around necrotic regions.

Twenty mice were divided in two groups with 10 animals each: group A was composed of uninfected mice while group B was formed by rodents infected with T. gondii. Five days after infection, blood was collected and serum separated, and fragments of liver and brain were obtained. In serum and liver homogenate was noted a significant reduction (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) in BChE activity in infected mice when compared with uninfected ones. In serum was observed an increase in the activity of alanine aminotransferase and urea, associated with reduction in alkaline phosphatase activity and in the levels of total protein and albumin. Histologically, there were foci of necrosis and parasites in the forms of tachyzoites and cysts, with bradyzoites in liver samples of infected animals. Based on these results, we conclude that toxoplasmosis reduces BChE activity in mice, and this alteration is probably related to the liver damage caused by the parasitism. Therefore, this enzymatic alteration can directly contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of the integrin \u03b1v subfamily in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), and to correlate the expression rate with tumor biological behavior and angiogenesis of the LSCC. The integrin \u03b1v subfamily, including \u03b1v, \u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b25, \u03b26 and \u03b28 subunits, was immunohistochemically found to be expressed in 64 patients with LSCC, and we analyzed the relationship between the expression rate and the clinicopathological stage of this cancer. Immunohistochemical staining for CD105 was carried out in the same group of the patients. The intratumoral microvessel density (IMVD) of the LSCC was calculated by CD105 staining, and the correlation between the IMVD and \u03b1v subfamily expression was discussed. The results showed that all members of the integrin \u03b1v subfamily could be detected in the LSCC. The expression rate of integrin \u03b1v and \u03b25 subunits in primary cancer was significantly higher than in normal tissue, and their expression rate in the group with lymphatic metastasis was significantly higher than in the group without metastasis. The IMVD of the group with positive expression of \u03b1v and \u03b25 subunits was significantly higher than in the group with negative expression, but there were no significant effects on the \u03b21, \u03b23, \u03b26 and \u03b28 subunits in these biological processes. In conclusion, the expressions of integrin \u03b1v and \u03b25 subunits were significantly associated with lymphatic metastasis and angiogenesis of the LSCC. Among the members of integrin \u03b1v subfamily, integrin \u03b1v\u03b25 might play an important role in invasion and metastases of the LSCC, and it may become a valuable marker for the evolution of the LSCC.",

MMP-9 is the most reliable one for invasive SCC grading. The extent of the expression of these markers is related to the infiltration pattern of SCC at the invasive front. The less invasive nature of VC can be associated with the expression pattern of these markers.",

Standard karyotype and FISH techniques showed that tumor cells carried two distinct translocations which had not been reported together in a same tumor. The first translocation juxtaposed the immunoglobulin lambda light chain locus with CCND1 locus, leading to Cyclin D1 overexpression. The second translocation revealed MYC rearrangement with a non-immunoglobulin gene partner located on the short arm of chromosome 4. The interpretation of the case on tissue sections alone could have been challenging. Indeed, the lack of CD5 and expression of CD10 associated with MYC rearrangement detected on interphasic nuclei could support the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or Burkitt lymphoma. This distinction is also especially important as these lymphoma subtypes require specific treatment.",

We report the case of an 11-year old girl with a complex breast lesion with hybrid features of fibroadenoma and intraductal papilloma with an early recurrence. Microscopically, the lesion was composed of dilated ducts showing intraluminal papillary projections with small to broad fibrovascular stalks. The typical leaf-like appearance of fibroadenoma was determined by the presence at the periphery of ducts compressed and distorted by the prominent stromal component. Despite its florid epithelial hyperplasia and mild cytological atypia (more evident in the relapse), immunohistochemical staining for p63 and smooth muscle actin highlighted a continuum outer myoepithelial layer, confirming the non-invasive appearance of the lesion. Two pathogenetic links have been hypothesized: one is based on the morphological continuum between these two entities, which may represent different evolutive stages in the same lesion; the other is based on epithelial/mesenchymal interactions. The possible malignant transformation of such complex lesion is also discussed, along with its differential diagnoses.The relevance of this case lies in its rarity, as well as in the therapeutic strategies related to its biological potential and to the necessity of a conservative treatment, due to the young age of the patient.",

This study aimed to analyze clinicopathological parameters in patients with PTC showing bone formation, to document histological features of bone formation in PTC, and to investigate osteogenic proteins. Bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-9 is known as the most potent osteoinductive protein of the BMP subtypes. Recent research suggests that the activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 1 is an essential cellular receptor that mediates BMP-9-induced osteogenic signaling. A retrospective review of tumor sections from 567 patients with a diagnosis of PTC was performed. Using immunohistochemistry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we investigated the expression of ALK1 and BMP-9 in normal thyroid tissue and PTC samples with and without bone formation. Bone formation was found in 13% of patients with PTC. A significant association was seen between bone formation and old age. BMP-9 expression in tumors was increased compared to that in normal thyroid tissues. BMP-9 expression in tumors with bone formation was not significantly different from that in tumors without bone formation. ALK1 expression in tumors with bone formation was increased compared to that in normal thyroid tissue and tumors without bone formation.

This uncommon glial neoplasm is a rarity, with only 57 cases reported in the literature so far. We report three cases of pituicytoma (aged between 7 and 24 years) presenting with reduced vision, headache and features of hypercortisolism in one case. Radiologically, these lesions mimicked meningioma, hypothalamic chiasmatic glioma and pituitary microadenoma, respectively. The second case is a 7-year-old girl, the youngest case on record. Since this tumor is uncommon, it is frequently misdiagnosed. Awareness of this entity is essential for planning management and treatment. We present a brief review of all cases reported in the medical literature, and describe the clinical symptomatology, associated endocrinological abnormalities, imaging characteristics, behavior and outcome.",

The patient history revealed a previous right lobectomy in another institution ten years before. The right neck dissection was histologically characterized by the presence of thymic residual and evidence of microfollicular microfoci (less than 1\u00a0mm) of thyroid tissue. Thyroid tumor cells were positive for thyroglobulin, TTF-1, HBME-1 and Galectin-3, while the residual ectopic thyroid tissue showed positivity only for TTF-1 and thyroglobulin. The molecular tests on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of BRAF-V600E mutation, but wild type BRAF in the ectopic tissue. The histo-morphological definition of these remnants plays the most important role, but the application of immunohistochemistry and molecular biology may help to reach a conclusive diagnosis.",

The morphological analysis showed cases that presented LF only in FVC (35%), LF only in the subglottic region (20%), lack of LF in FVC (30%) and lymphoid aggregates, which did not characterize an LF (15%). The cases of LF in the subglottic region were significantly younger compared to the ones that presented LF in the FVC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017).

Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was also used for HER2 amplification, and the association with TAMs count, EGFR expression, and triple-negative phenotype was analyzed. Twenty-eight of 186 patients (15.05%) had the TNP.

An enlarged tumor was detected on digital rectal examination. Imaging studies showed a solid and lobular homogenous tumor of 7.0\u00a0cm in diameter. The tumor was attached to the right dorsal aspect of the prostate with compression of the seminal vesicles and rectum. It was considered that the tumor had arisen from the prostate, although the patient's serum prostate-specific antigen level was low (0.436\u00a0ng/mL). The histological diagnosis by prostate needle biopsy was a spindle cell tumor. At cystoprostatectomy, the tumor was confirmed to be separated from the prostate by a fibrous band, and showed spindle cells with a fascicular growth pattern, but without necrotic areas. Mitotic figures were noted in 12 of 50 high-power fields. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for the KIT protein (CD117), CD34, Discovered on GIST-1 (DOG-1), and vimentin. In contrast, they were negative for desmin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, pancytokeratin (AE1/AE3), and S100 protein. The Ki-67 labeling index was 5%. The genetic analyses targeting the c-kit gene revealed a point mutation at codon 559 (GTT\u00a0\u2192\u00a0GAT). The diagnosis of GIST was confirmed on the basis of the morphological features, immunoprofile, and results of the molecular analyses.

We present a case of cutaneous multicentric Castleman's disease mimicking IgG4-related disease. A 55-year-old Japanese woman developed erythematous and brown plaques on her back. Skin biopsy revealed regressive follicles with interfollicular plasmacytosis, and many plasma cells were positive for IgG4 (mean 263.67\u00a0\u00b1\u00a079.19, range 214\u2013355 per high power field).

Furthermore, serum IgG4 level was significantly elevated (1490\u00a0mg/dl; normal range: 4.8\u2013105\u00a0mg/dl). However, laboratory findings of anemia, hypoalbuminemia, polyclonal gammaglobulinemia, high C-reactive protein level, and elevated serum interleukin-6 level were consistent with hyper-IL-6 syndrome. Hence, the diagnosis of cutaneous multicentric Castleman's disease was made. In conclusion, IgG4-related disease cannot be differentiated from hyper-IL-6 syndromes on histology alone.

By virtue of its distinctive genotype (codeletion 1p/19q), oligodendroglioma is a particularly inviting paradigm to test the assumption that such mixed tumors are clonally derived from a glial primary. We observed this constellation in a 41-year-old male who underwent two resection procedures for a recurring right frontal tumor at five years\u2019 interval. On imaging, both lesions were contrast-enhancing, and measured 7\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a07\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.8\u00a0cm and 7\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a06.5\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a04\u00a0cm, respectively. Following the first operation, temozolomide monotherapy was administered. Whereas initial histology showed conventional anaplastic oligodendroglioma, the recurrence consisted mostly of a fibrosarcoma-like, fascicular neoplasm that was immunoreactive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, S100 protein, and focally epithelial membrane antigen. In between, a subset of otherwise indistinguishable spindle cells expressed GFAP, and focally merged with residues of oligodendroglioma. Molecular testing for loss of heterozygosity confirmed codeletion of 1p/19q in both the primary tumor and the sarcomatous recurrence. Similarly, generalized immunoreactivity for the mutant R132H form of isocitrate dehydrogenase in both lesions indicated an identical mutation of the IDH1 gene. By the above standards, biologically consistent \u201coligosarcomas\u201d are felt to be exceedingly rare, and possibly participate of a nosologically heterogeneous group of combined glial/mesenchymal lesions that may also include iatrogenically induced second malignancies as well as true collision tumors.",

Surgically explanted calcified aortic valves (n\u00a0=\u00a014) were immunostained for markers relevant to these mechanisms and evaluated in the center (NodCtr) and edge (NodEdge) of the calcified nodule (NodCtr), tissue directly surrounding nodule (NodSurr); center and tissue surrounding small \u201cprenodules\u201d (PreNod, PreNodSurr); and normal fibrosa layer (CollFibr). Pearson correlations were determined between staining intensities of markers within regions. Ossification markers primarily localized to NodCtr and NodEdge, along with markers related to hyaluronan turnover and hypoxia. Markers of brown adipocytic differentiation were frequently co-localized with markers of hypoxia. In NodCtr and NodSurr, brown fat and ossification markers correlated with hyaluronidase-1, whereas these markers, as well as hypoxia, correlated with hyaluronan synthases in NodEdge. The protein product of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 stimulated gene-6 strongly correlated with ossification markers and hyaluronidase in the regions surrounding the nodules (NodSurr, PreNodSurr).

     "abstract": "In the present study, we aimed to evaluate estrogen receptor ER-alpha status in 61 breast cancer cases using Sp1 and 1D5 monoclonal antibodies. Tissue array platforms were generated containing samples of breast cancer and positive controls that were assayed by immunohistochemistry applying monoclonal primary antibodies anti-ER alpha, SP1 and 1D5. We noted a high concordance rate (96.7%) between the referred antibodies. Moreover, we calculated the Kappa factor (0.921), indicating that 1D5 and SP1 provided overlapping ER\u03b1 expression results. Indeed, we observed controversial results only in 2 samples studied, which were ER-negative when stained with 1D5 and ER-positive when assessed with SP1. Total concordance of PS was obtained (Pearson and intraclass CF, 0.7351 and 0.6193, respectively). However, concordance between the antibodies seems to be more accurate in higher PS values. An excellent IS correlation between antibodies was observed throughout the population (Spearman's CF, \u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.9150). Following the Allred score, 17 out of 42 positive BC samples diverged, with 1D5 always pointing to weaker staining than SP1. When calculating Spearman's CF of Total Score (TS) within the population, an excellent correlation between both the antibodies (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.9238) was noted. Nonetheless, the results were less concordant among the BC-positive cases (\u03c1\u00a0=\u00a00.7743). Indeed, 20 samples were differentially classified using the antibodies (only 3 had higher TS with 1D5). Considering the mean TS of all samples or of invasive ductal carcinoma, SP1 provided higher scores than 1D5 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). We recommend the use of the anti-ER RMAb SP1 due to the high probability that the BC ER\u03b1 status can be determined accurately as the reagent provides higher IS. Therefore, the A-score was higher than the MMAb 1D5. Ultimately, higher IS and A-score decrease the possibility of ER\u03b1 status misinterpretation and, consequently, inappropriate BC treatment that would compromise the patient's quality of life and overall survival. We recommend the use of anti-ER RMAb SP1 due to the high probability that the BC ER status can be determined accurately as the reagent provides higher IS, therefore higher A-score, than the MMAb 1D5.",

Glomerular and tubulointerstitial morphometric variables at the time of renal biopsy were analyzed with respect to this outcome. Univariate analysis revealed that significant negative prognostic factors for this outcome were higher cholesterol and smaller albumin concentrations, higher creatinine and maximal 24-h proteinuria, higher grade of nephroangiosclerosis, higher glomerular basement membrane thickness and glomerulopathy index, higher interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy percentage and higher injury score. In multivariate analysis, only the maximal 24-h proteinuria and interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy percentage were independent predictors of this outcome. The results suggest that morphometric analysis, mainly quantitative measurement of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy percentage, injury score, glomerular basement membrane thickness and glomerulopathy index could be used as an additional method for risk stratification of patients with idiopathic membranous nephropathy.",

Increased densities of macrophages and activation of angiogenesis have been identified as common events in the progression of several neoplasms. Ameloblastoma is one of the most frequent odontogenic tumors and an excellent model for the study of neoplasm progression due to the different clinical variants that it exhibits. Here, by immunohistochemical studies using antibodies against CD68 and CD34, we evaluated the density of macrophages and microvessels associated to 45 paraffin-embedded ameloblastomas. In solid/multicystic ameloblastoma (SMA), we observed significantly higher densities of both macrophages and microvessels than in unicystic (UA) and desmoplastic (DA) ameloblastomas. Likewise, higher densities of macrophages and microvessels were found in UA than in DA. Furthermore, a predominance of intratumoral and peritumoral macrophage infiltrates was seen in SMA, while in UA, both macrophages and microvessels were also detected in the wall of the cysts. In contrast, DA had scant macrophages and microvessels, mainly situated distant from tumoral cells. In addition, a high correlation between macrophage and microvessel densities was observed in the samples (r\u00a0=\u00a00.9623). Our results suggest that these two tumor microenvironmental elements could have an important role during ameloblastoma progression.",

     "abstract": "To help pathologists avoid misdiagnosis of intraductal neoplasms arising from the pancreatobiliary system, we report two cases that illustrate diagnostic pitfalls. The first is of a 66-year-old man who complained of appetite loss. An early examination led to a diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Macroscopically, a multilocular cyst without visible mucin was identified. Histologically, the compartments consisted of complex fusion of tubular glands surrounded by dilated pancreatic duct. The neoplasm resembled an acinar cell cystadenocarcinoma. However, the neoplastic cells were negative for trypsin. Thus, the final histopathologic diagnosis was an unusual cystic variant of intraductal tubulopapillary neoplasm (ITPN) of the pancreas. The second case is of a 71-year-old man who complained of right upper quadrant pain. Although bile duct stone was suspected, a polypoid nodule was extracted. Histologically, the nodule was composed of tubular glands, with some complex fusion and focal dysplasia, consistent with carcinoma. In addition, lack of MUC-5AC expression led to an initial impression of ITPN of the bile duct. However, the neoplasm showed dysplastic cells based on the columnar cells resembling pyloric glands, indicating the sequential progression. Thus, the final histopathological diagnosis was intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Because phenotypic variants of intraductal neoplasms of the pancreatobiliary system exist, ITPN and ITPN-mimicking tumor must be carefully differentiated from other intraductal neoplasms.",

The histological tumor types and histological grades of multifocal/multicentric carcinomas in each tumor focus were compared, and mismatches among foci were recorded.Ninety-one of the 418 cases reviewed had multiple carcinomas (21.77%). A comparison between multiple synchronous tumor foci revealed that their histological type was different in 12.08% of the cases. Mismatches among foci were also observed in 9.89% of the cases when evaluating the histological grade, and 5 out of 9 additional tumor foci with a different grade from the largest (index) tumor (55.55%) displayed a higher grade compared to the index tumor.Since the histological tumor type and histological grade of the individual foci may vary considerably within the same tumor and the additional foci may be of higher grade than the index tumor, we believe that reporting morphologic parameters with more unfavorable characteristics in addition to the parameters of the index tumor is imperative.",

We present two cases of gonadoblastoma associated with complete gonadal dysgenesis and Turner syndrome, respectively, with dysgerminoma overgrowth found in one case. We were interested in the DNA ploidy, the presence of Y chromosome DNA sequence and the status of chromosome 12p arm among the tumor cells. We performed cytophotometry to analyze the DNA content and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to identify the Y chromosome and the isochromosome 12p within the tumor cells. The cytophotometric result showed diploid DNA content in gonadoblastoma, whereas dysgerminoma revealed aneuploid DNA. The FISH result revealed Y chromosome DNA sequence within gonadoblastoma and dysgerminoma. Isochromosome 12p was identified in dysgerminoma, but not in gonadoblastoma. We conclude that g onadoblastoma and dysgerminoma have a strong association with the Y chromosome, and dysgerminoma overgrowth is due to further chromosomal aberrations, such as isochromosome 12p. Histological, immunohistocheimcal and molecular studies should render the correct diagnosis. Identifying dysgerminoma overgrowth is crucial since it is associated with adverse prognosis and requires additional therapy.",

LV-SEM showed a precise and fine structure of the glomerulus in both formalin fixed paraffin and glutaraldehyde-osmium tetroxide-fixed epoxy resin sections up to 10,000-fold magnification. The spike formation on the basement membrane was clearly observed in the membranous nephropathy samples. Similarly to transmission electron microscopy, electron dense deposits were observed in the epoxy resin sections of the IgA nephropathy and membranous nephropathy samples. LV-SEM could accurately show various glomerular lesions at high magnification after a simple and rapid processing of the samples. We consider that this is a novel and useful diagnostic tool for renal pathologies.",

The results of real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed an enhanced expression of MAP4K4 in lung adenocarcinomas relative to adjacent non-tumorous lung tissues at both transcriptional and translational levels. Immunohistochemistry showed that 130 of 309 (42%) lung adenocarcinomas had high expression of MAP4K4.

However, tissue hemostasis in IBD patients was only incidentally reported. Accordingly, the current study characterizes changes in tissue hemostasis components in a colon inflammatory setting.Serial cryostat sections of endoscopic mucosal biopsy specimens taken from 26 consecutive IBD patients diagnosed de novo and normal colon resection specimens taken from 6 patients were immunohistochemically stained with monoclonal anti-human tissue factor (TF), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), thrombomodulin (TM), as well as CD3 and CD68 positive cells.The hemostatic components studied differed significantly from the control subjects. Up-regulation predominated in the case of TF while down-regulation was mainly found in TM and TFPI in IBD. In the control sections, TF was observed in a few fibroblast-shaped cells in the lamina propria, while in the majority of IBD sections, TF positively stained small microvessels, infiltrating mononuclear cells and fibroblast-shaped cells tightly surrounding the colon crypts. Thrombomodulin intensively stained the endothelium of the small capillary vessels in the control, whereas such staining mainly accompanied infiltrating mononuclear cells of the IBD subjects. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor positively stained the endothelium of the small capillary vessels in the control group, whereas in the IBD group endothelial cells presented only weak TFPI staining. The mean number of CD3-positive lymphocytes in IBD was 23.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a014.3, but the mean number of CD68-positive cells was 114.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a055.8.

There was no relationship between CD3 and CD68 (+) cells and the hemostasis markers studied.The results of the current study indicate a shift of tissue hemostasis toward the procoagulant state irrespective of the severity of inflammatory infiltration. In addition, TF distribution in the colon sections of IBD patients may indicate a role in the restoration of the barrier function in injured intestinal mucosa.",

In the present study, the nuclear or cytoplasmic HDGF staining level was investigated in 86 patients with primary breast cancer by immunohistochemistry; the relationship between nuclear or cytoplasmic HDGF staining level and clinicopathological parameters was examined by Two-tailed Mann\u2013Whitney U-test or Krustal\u2013Wallis. The prognostic value of nuclear or cytoplasmic HDGF staining level in disease-free survival and overall survival was analyzed by Kaplan\u2013Meier methods and log-rank test. We found that the percentage of cases with strong nuclear HDGF staining level was significantly higher in the cases with high tumor grade, high stage, high proliferation index (Ki-67 index\u00a0>\u00a020%), as well as in those with lymph node invasion and recurrence (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) compared to those without. No significant correlation was found between cytoplasmic HDGF expression and any clinicopathological variables. In addition, disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly lower in patients with high nuclear HDGF expression (level 2) than in those with low nuclear HDGF expression (level 0 and level 1). Further Cox multivariate analysis showed that high nuclear HDGF expression is an independent factor for indicating poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. No significant difference in disease-free survival rate and overall survival was found between different cytoplasmic HDGF staining levels. All these findings suggest that increased nuclear HDGF expression is involved in tumor progression and might be used as a new prognosticator for breast cancer.",

We reviewed 10 cases of glioneurocytomas diagnosed in our department during 2003 and 2004, with emphasis on clinicopathological features, immunohistochemical profile, genetic aberrations and prognosis. The cases included in the study showed equal gender distribution and age range of 23\u201340 years and mean age of 34.4 years at the time of initial presentation. Most of the tumors were centered in the frontal lobe. In our study, GFAP was the most sensitive and relatively specific marker for glial differentiation and remains the marker of choice for glial differentiation. CD56 and S100 protein were sensitive but non-specific. Vimentin, CD57 and NF were non-contributory in the immunohistochemical work up of glioneurocytomas.We concluded that the diagnosis of glioneurocytomas requires attention to morphological details and proper immunohistochemical assessment, using a panel of both glial and neuronal markers. Particular attention is recommended to the existence of the intermediate neurocytic cells which may be unique for these tumors. Future implication with full molecular analysis for gene expression profiling is suggested for proper and accurate identifying this entity.",

Both of these changes were not affected by PYC. Consequently to metabolic and hemodynamic alterations, significant prolongation of QT interval (by 20%; p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was present in diabetic rats, however, PYC failed to correct it.

The aim of our study was to characterize DCAMKL-1 expression in normal human colon by immunohistochemistry. DCAMKL-1 immunostaining was performed on histologically normal colorectal biopsies from 14 patients. Immunoreactivity was found in over 60% of colonic crypts and was represented by strong cytoplasmic staining, anti-luminal in distribution, and was reminiscent of cytoplasmic orientation of neuroendocrine cells. The highest number (48.5%) of DCAMKL-1 positive cells was found in the first 4 cells from the crypt base. Seventy percent of DCAMKL-1 positive cells were located in the lower third of the crypt, 26% in the middle third and 4% in the upper third. Therefore, in normal colonic mucosa, expression of DCAMKL-1 is not confined to the stem cell compartment. When we compared DCAMKL-1 immunostaining with that of the leucine-rich-repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5), an intestinal stem cell marker, and chromogranin-A (CgA), an enteroendocrine cell marker, we found that DCAMKL-1 positive cells co-stained with Lgr5 only at the crypt base, but co-stained with CgA throughout the crypt. Our findings suggest that DCAMKL-1 marks a subset of colorectal stem cells, as well as a subset of enteroendocrine cells.",

However, the clinical utility of BRAF expression has not been clinically explored so far. We studied 67 thyroid nodules (32 benign nodules and 35 PTC cases). BRAF mRNA expression levels measured by a quantitative real-time PCR and a PCR-RFLP were used to identify BRAFV600E mutation. BRAF mRNA expression was significantly higher in malignant (198.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0373.9\u00a0AU) than in benign (4.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.9\u00a0AU) nodules (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

A cut-point of 4.712, identified by the ROC curve, was able to sort out malignant nodules with an accuracy of 78.8%.

Neuroimaging revealed a right cerebellopontine angle tumor. Most of the tumor was cellular although some less cellular areas were seen. Sinusoidally dilated large vessels, including staghorn type, were seen. Nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitotic activity (5 mitosis/10 high power field) were regarded as evidence of anaplasia. Diffuse CD34 immunoreactivity and focal positivity for Factor XIIIa were seen in the tumor, which was negative for EMA and S100. The tumor also displayed rich reticulin network.Solitary fibrous tumor at cerebellopontine angle is rare, and 20 such cases (five reported as hemangiopericytoma) have been reported in the English literature.",

The commonest histological type was infiltrating duct carcinoma (83.2%), followed by infiltrating lobular carcinoma (9.1%) and medullary carcinoma (3.2%). The luminal A subtype was significantly correlated to low tumor grade, lower number of positive lymph nodes metastasis, absence of both necrosis and syncytial growth pattern.We concluded that the commonest molecular subtype of invasive breast carcinoma among Egyptian women is luminal subtype A, which displayed favorable features.

     "abstract": "B lymphocytes express various different types of surface immunoglobulins that are largely unrelated to other hematological lines, although some reports have described a relationship between malignant B cells and other cells such as macrophages. Multiple genes of hematopoietic lineage, including transcription factors, are co-expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, a phenomenon referred to as \u201clineage priming\u201d. Changes in the expression levels and timing of transcription factors can induce the lineage conversion of committed cells, which indicates that the regulation of transcription factors might be particularly critical for maintaining hierarchical hematopoietic development.The aim of this study was to evaluate the surface markers of particular IgM-positive and irregularly nucleated cells detected in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and to assess their association with diagnosis and inflammatory cell recruitment.Small intestine, colon and rectal biopsy specimens of 96 IBD patients were studied. Immunoglobulin-producing cells (IPCs) were analyzed by means of immunofluorescence using polyclonal rabbit anti-human Ig and goat anti-human IgM. The specimens positive for B cells with irregular nuclei were assessed using monoclonal antibodies specific for CD79, and \u03bb and \u03ba chains in order to confirm their B cell nature. CD15+ cells, an important marker of inflammatory cell recruitment, were also evaluated. Statistical correlations were sought between the histological findings and clinical expression.34 (35.4%) of the 96 patients (64 with ulcerative colitis and 32 with Crohn's disease) presented a periglandial localization of IPCs with irregular nuclei, which showed surface markers specific for the B cell subset, such as IgM and CD79, but quantitative differences in \u03bb and \u03ba chains. These specimens also contained CD15-positive cells, which are usually absent in healthy controls. The quantitative aspects and localization of the CD15-positive cells correlated with the distribution of the IPCs with irregular nuclei. IPCs with irregular nuclei were significantly more frequent in those patients with Crohn's disease than in those with ulcerative colitis (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).The finding of a subpopulation of cells that simultaneously showed irregular nuclei and B cell markers, such as functional surface IgM, in patients with IBD suggests that an unusual subgroup of B cells that correlates with CD15 expression and a diagnosis of Crohn's disease may be observed in the inflammatory process.",

It plays a role in the migration and invasion of transformed epithelial cells. Binding of OPN to its receptor CD44v6 can enhance cell motility and migration. The purpose of this study was to compare the expression of these markers between odontogenic cysts of varying biological behavior. We examined OPN and CD44v6 expression in tissue sections of 14OKCs, 14COCs, 14RCs and 14DCs by immunohistochemistry. OPN and CD44v6 immunostaining was observed in all lining epithelial cells of the studied lesions with different degrees.

On the other hand, since its initial description in the medical literature, several authors have attributed the formation of such bodies to the presence of microorganisms such as in the case of Russell body gastritis and its association to Helicobacter pylori infection. In an attempt to possibly characterize the presence of an infectious organism, we performed a thorough biomolecular analysis on a case of a 69-year-old female presenting with Russell body duodenitis which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the second report of this clinical entity in the English literature.

The significance of previously not described genetic alterations in anaplastic astrocytomas presented here needs to be confirmed in a larger series.",

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the contribution of acute alcohol in sepsis-related liver damages using a Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) model. Rats were divided into 7 groups (5 rats/group): control (saline-injected), sham-operated, CLP, ethanol (1.0 and 2.0\u00a0g/kg b.w) and CLP\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol. The CLP\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol group received a single dose of ethanol following sepsis induction. Sepsis induction caused early changes in lipid peroxidation products in liver, whereas ethanol alone (2.0\u00a0g/kg b.w) resulted in a significant increase (\u223c21%) in lipid peroxidation, which was further increased (\u223c57%) in CLP rats treated with alcohol. CLP operation and alcohol treatment exhibited additive effects on plasma catalase, liver glutathione and glutathione S-transferase (GST), which were primarily suppressed due to ethanol. Hepatic cytochrome P4501A1, which was elevated in CLP rats, was reversed in the CLP\u00a0+\u00a0ethanol group. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 was markedly elevated (\u223c85%) in septic rats, but was unaffected in septic rats having received ethanol. Histopathological observations revealed that inflammatory reactions in liver in response to CLP operation are not intensified by ethanol administration. On the basis of biochemical and histopathological results, it can be concluded that acute ethanol treatment is responsible for early changes in oxidative stress, which may lead to polymicrobial sepsis-related organ damage.",

Ki-67 LI ranged between 1% and 5% (median: 1%); no expression of ER was found in all the cases, whereas PR immunoexpression was found in 86% of the tumors. High MMP-9 expression was encountered in 46% of meningiomas, and it was significantly correlated with the percentage of PR expression. The recurrence rate was 1.7%. The only recurred case showed high MMP-9 expression, absence of PR and low Ki-67 LI.Our findings confirm that spinal meningiomas are indolent tumors with low growth fraction and recurrence rate. In these neoplasms, high MMP-9 expression seems to be associated with the development of recurrences only in the absence of PR expression. Thus, the evaluation of both MMP-9 and PR expression might be of use in the identification of spinal meningiomas at higher risk of relapse.",

We describe a case of primary EOES/PNET of the thyroid gland in a 66-year-old man with a previous history of large B cell lymphoma. During a routine follow-up examination, the patient underwent an ultrasound cervical scan showing a solid nodule of the left thyroid lobe. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the nodule suggested a neuroendocrine tumor. Histological and immunohistochemical examination of the surgical specimen supported a diagnosis of EOES/PNET, which was further confirmed by the demonstration of EWSR1 gene translocation by means of fluorescent in situ hybridization and by the detection of glycogen particles and neurosecretory granules by means of electron microscopy. Total body computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging excluded the involvement of other sites, and therefore a diagnosis of primary EOES/PNET of the thyroid gland was made.This paper also discusses the main differential diagnoses, including lymphoma recurrence, other small round cell tumors (primary or metastatic), and a thyroid localization of an EWS/PNET from another organ.",

In this paper, we describe a case of ASC and discuss its distinct histopathology in metastatic lymph nodes. A heavy smoker man presented with a progressive neck mass. Based on incisional biopsy, diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) was made and total laryngectomy with bilateral radical neck dissection was performed. Sections of primary tumor showed a well-differentiated SCC. However, lymph node metastases had a distinct feature of glandular structures. Further investigation with Mayer's mucicarmine stain confirmed the presence of rare scattered glands in primary tumor and the final diagnosis was changed to ASC. Adenosquamous carcinoma is a distinct entity and must be distinguished from the common SCC of larynx. As a result, when a lesion with diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma shows evidence of glandular differentiation in a subsequent biopsy or in nodal metastases, more investigation is necessary. Moreover, the glandular structures in primary tumor, as in this case, may be rare and inconspicuous. Therefore, we suggest the precise evaluation of metastatic lymph nodes for any laryngeal tumor with diagnosis of SCC. This helps to make appropriate therapeutic decisions with respect to the aggressive behavior of ASC and its high propensity for lymph node metastasis.",

We describe a unique case of an EBV+ malignant lymphoma of B-cell origin with hybrid features of EBV+ DLBCL and EBV+ cHL in a 67-year-old female without an identifiable etiology for immunodeficiency. The biopsy of an enlarged lymph node showed a polymorphic infiltrate containing Reed\u2013Sternberg-like pleomorphic large cells, which were positive for CD30 and CD15. Although CD20 was negative and PAX5 and CD45 were down-regulated, the pleomorphic large cells expressed multiple other B-cell antigens which are characteristically absent in cHL. EBV-encoded RNA hybridization (EBER) studies demonstrated nuclear reactivity in the large cells as well as in the smaller bystander cells. A clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was also detected by PCR. Although the results of the EBV and genotypic studies suggest this case may be an example of EBV+ DLBCL of the elderly instead of EBV+ cHL, the immunophenotype is strikingly ambiguous.

Whether goblet cells must be present or not is a matter of debate and definitions vary worldwide. Although the use of the term \u201ccolumnar metaplasia\u201d tends to circumvent these issues, it can also be subdivided into those with and without goblet cells. There is some evidence that Barrett's esophagus results from a multistep process in which goblet cells are a secondary event. Hence, Barrett's adenocarcinoma has recently been shown to originate from areas lacking goblet cells. The histological diagnosis of neoplasia is often hampered by marked interobserver variation. New endoscopic techniques allow for local resections of neoplasia with curative intent. Pathologists should know which pieces of information gastroenterologists need for management options: surveillance versus therapy such as endoscopic resection with or endoscopic ablation without histological specimen. The most important information for gastroenterologists is whether there is neoplasia or not; if any, they need to know the grade (low grade, high grade, carcinoma) and risk factors (vessel permeation, poor differentiation, resection complete in case of endoscopic resection, depth of infiltration).",

It is widely accepted that inflammation can increase cancer risk, promoting tumor progression. Therefore, inflammation is regarded as the seventh hallmark of cancer. In recent years, the inflammation\u2013cancer connection of Barrett's carcinogenesis has been intensively studied, unraveling genetic abnormalities. Besides genetic alterations, inflammation is also epigenetically linked to loss of protein expression through transcriptional silencing via promoter methylation. Key mediators linking inflammation and Barrett's carcinogenesis include reactive oxygen species (ROS), NF\u03baB, inflammatory cytokines, prostaglandins, and specific microRNAs (miRNAs). Therefore, the decipherment of molecular pathways that contain these and novel inflammatory key mediators is of major importance for diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis. The detailed elucidation of the signaling molecules involved in Barrett's carcinogenesis will be important for the development of pharmaceutical inhibitors.

A solitary subcutaneous nodule of 1.5\u00a0cm diameter was excised from the right ring finger of a 19-year-old female with no antecedents of neurofibromatosis or relevant trauma. Histology revealed a monotonous, yet cytologically dimorphic proliferation of classical granular cells intermingled with flattened, inconspicuous perineurial cells. Immunohistochemical double labeling detected expression of S100 protein in the former and of EMA and GLUT-1 in the latter. While the respective staining patterns for S100 protein and EMA or GLUT-1 tended to be mutually exclusive, a minority of cells exhibited transitional granular cell/perineurial immunophenotype. Electron microscopy permitted direct visualization of a plethora of lysosomes in the granular cell moiety, and of pinocytotic vesicles and tight junctions in perineurial cells. Intratumoral axons were not detected. Expanding intraneurally, the lesion showed discrete encapsulation by the local perineurium, and resulted in plexiform growth. The MIB-1 labeling index averaged 1%. We interpret our findings as supporting evidence for the dual cell lineage to have arisen through metaplasia, with the tumor's dynamics probably having been driven by the granular cell component.",

It is important to distinguish PASH from fibroadenoma clinically, and from true blood capillaries and angiosarcoma histologically. In the present case, giant multinucleated cells lined the pseudovascular spaces, which was markedly different from that of conventional breast PASH. The origin of PASH has been reported to be either the fibroblast or the myofibroblast phenotype and may be affected by endocrine signaling because many cases have been reported in premenopausal women, and cases are often estrogen (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) positive. However, previous reports have identified PASH in NF-1 in juvenile males only, and the cases were negative for \u03b1-SMA, ER and PR. The cause and prognosis of PASH in NF-1 may be distinguished from that of conventional PASH, and mast cells, histiocytes and CD54 may play roles.",

Biopsy handling and orientation are of utmost importance to avoid artifacts that may impair the pathologist's ability to detect pathology and normality. Immunostaining with anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody should be carried out, and a simplified histological classification may help distinguish atrophic from non-atrophic stages of CD enteropathy.Meticulous attention to biopsy orientation, handling and processing \u2013 together with the knowledge of the most common histological artifacts \u2013 is necessary to avoid a wrong histological interpretation which, in turn, may lead to misdiagnosis in CD.",

Increased glucose uptake and lactate production have been detected during malignant transformation. Based on energy production, malignancies can be divided into two subclasses: (a) tumor cells which use the mitochondrial machinery for ATP synthesis, and (b) tumor cells which generate ATP by glucose fermentation and lactate production even in the presence of oxygen (aerobic glycolysis). Recently, transketolase-like protein 1 (TKTL1) gene expression has been shown to contribute to carcinogenesis through increased aerobic glycolysis and hypoxia-inducible factor alpha stabilization. In the present study, 197 patients suffering from lung cancer were investigated by immunohistochemistry for the presence of TKTL1 protein expression. We detected: (1) moderate to strong TKTL1 expression (immune reactive score\u00a0>\u00a0100) in 39.1% of the investigated lung cancer patients; (2) a complete lack of TKTL1 by immunohistochemistry in 12.7% of lung cancer cases, with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) being most frequent in this subgroup; (3) no correlation of TKTL1 with overall survival, disease-free survival, any of the established variables of the TNM system, grading, stage, smoking status, or gender. Based on this data, we conclude that TKTL1 could be a target protein for improved therapeutic strategies in some cases of lung cancer.",

We found that high progranulin expression was associated with higher breast carcinoma angiogenesis, reflected by increased vascular endothelial growth factor expression and higher microvessel density. However, no immunohistochemical evidence currently exists to correlate progranulin expression with clinicopathological features in different intrinsic subtypes of breast carcinoma biopsies. The aim of this study was to investigate the progranulin expression profiles in the intrinsic subtypes of breast carcinomas and their relevance to histopathological and clinicopathological features.Tissue blocks containing 264 cases of breast carcinomas from 2006 to 2009 were classified as different intrinsic subtypes. Tissues of four intrinsic subtypes were immunostained for progranulin, vascular endothelial growth factor and CD105. Their relevance to histopathological and clinicopathological features was also analyzed. Twenty tissue samples from breast fibroadenomas were included in this study.Progranulin expression showed no significant differences in different intrinsic subtypes, although an increasing tendency could be found in the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subgroup (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a05.00, df\u00a0=\u00a03, p\u00a0=\u00a00.17).

It was noted that the EGFR expression level of the pN\u2212 TNBC subtype was significantly higher in cases with strong progranulin expression than in cases with weak progranulin expression (\u03c72\u00a0=\u00a011.26, df\u00a0=\u00a01, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01).A significantly higher expression level of progranulin in pN\u2212 TNBC suggests that progranulin is a promising new target for pN\u2212 TNBC treatment. Strong expression of progranulin correlates with positive EGFR expression in the pN\u2212 TNBC subtype. The close relationship between EGFR and progranulin/VEGF/CD105 expression may partly play a role in high angiogenesis levels in the pN\u2212 TNBC subtype.",

Cases were re-classified according to the 2005 WHO classification of OTs. The relative frequency of different types of tumors was also analyzed and compared with the literature.OTs represent 3.75% of all cases received during a period of 30 years. Ninety-eight percent of these tumors were benign and the rest malignant. Mandible to maxilla ratio is 2.8:1. The posterior part, the molar region, is the most frequently affected site for the mandible whilst it is the anterior region for the maxilla. The age ranges from 1 to 80 years, with a mean age of 30.6 years. Ameloblastoma of solid/multicystic and unicystic types showed a high preponderance for the mandible (>90%) with a ratio of 12.9:1 and 10.8:1, respectively. Out of 1677 cases, 48.7% were ameloblastoma, and other tumors, such as keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) and odontoma, were 25.7% and 10.1%, respectively. There is a significant change in the frequency of OTs after the inclusion of odontogenic keratocyst as a tumor.Although odontoma is said to be the commonest in western countries, our results showed ameloblastoma as the commonest followed by KCOT, and the relative frequencies of different tumors have changed significantly as a result of inclusion of KCOT in the new classification.",

Only 23 patients could be included in this study. Following the recommendations by Maru et al., two independent pathologists, blinded to the outcome of the patients, measured the tumor thickness at the TNI in hematoxylin\u2013eosin stained representative slides of the hepatectomy specimens. The outcome was estimated as the time elapsed between hepatectomy and death due to disease (disease-specific survival; DSS).Two patients showed a complete pathological response, 16 cases a major response, and 5 cases a minor pathological response. The mean thickness at the TNI was 0.73\u00a0mm (0.01\u20132.5). The ROC analysis defined a cut-off point of 1.34\u00a0mm best discriminated between patients with a good and a poor prognosis. The mean thickness at the TNI for patients dying of disease was 1.99 (1.06 for survivors). A comparison of the survival curves confirmed that thickness at the TNI was a significant predictor of disease-free survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025).This study demonstrates the value of tumor thickness and TNI in predicting disease-free survival. These results are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that thickness of TNI is an important prognostic variable following hepatic resection of colon metastases. Prospective studies are necessary to confirm these retrospective results. Pathology reporting of this parameter, together with the pathological response and margin, may help clinicians to make decisions regarding further therapy.",

The mean age was 39.1 the mean size was 3.3\u00a0cm. 83% of the cases had spindle cell sarcoma-like areas. Two of six cases also had a chondrosarcoma-like component. The epithelial component was invasive ductal carcinoma in all. MNF116, vimentin, CD10, and SMA expressions were as follows: mesenchymal cells: 33%, 100%, 50%, 83%, epithelial cells: 100%, 50%, 33%, 0%. All were triple negative. 66.6% presented with the axillary lymph node metastases. The mean follow-up period was 51 months, 50% died of the disease. Two had distant metastases to the lung. Our series which only included mixed epithelial\u2013mesenchymal type metaplastic carcinoma of the breast showed myoepithelial differentiation with a worse prognosis.",

Immunostaining for VEGF-C/VEGF-D/flt-4, p63 and SMA was carried out. The chi-square distribution and the Pearson correlation were applied.A statistically significant relationship (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) was found in the group of tumors with myoepithelial differentiation regarding simultaneous positive staining for VEGF-C/VEGF-D and flt-4. All pleomorphic adenomas (PA) exhibited a statistically significant coexpression of the three antibodies. p63 and SMA were strongly expressed in the same areas as VEGF-C, VEGF-D and flt-4.The cells responsible for the strong expression of VEGF-C, VEGF-D and flt-4 in PAs are myoepithelial cells. Coexpression of flt-4 and its ligands in all PAs suggests the presence of a dominant VEGF-C/VEGF-D/flt-4 axis in this tumor.",

The present study investigated the effects of Artemisia campestris (Ac), a plant of the Asteraceae family, on renal impairment and oxidative stress in alloxan-induced diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by a single subcutaneous injection of alloxan (120\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121) in rats. Ac (200\u00a0mg\u00a0kg\u22121) was administered to diabetic rats for 3 weeks. Diabetic renal injury was associated with hyperglycemia, increased serum creatinine, urea and uric acid levels. This nephropathophysiology was associated with a surproduction of nitric oxide (NO), malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) levels and a decrease in glutathione (GSH) levels. In addition, hyperglycemia increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), in the kidney of diabetic rats. Treatment with Ac effectively ameliorated diabetic renal dysfunction by reducing oxidative and nitrosative stress. Histological studies also supported the experimental findings. The results suggested that Ac might act as a beneficial agent against renal dysfunctions developed in alloxan-induced diabetes.",

CK7 was negative in all microsatellite stable tumors (MSS), but all carcinomas presenting microsatellite instability (MSI) and BRAF mutations were diffusely positive for this marker. CK20 was diffusely expressed in 79.06% of MSS tumors. Regarding MSI, in case with no BRAF mutations, a progressive decrease in CK20 expression was noted, and in BRAF-mutated adenocarcinomas, no expression of CK20 was observed. It seems that in case of MSI located on the proximal colon, which also presents BRAF mutations, CK20/CK7 may present a changing immunophenotype pattern, which may complicate the differential diagnosis of metastatic tumors.

Eight years later MCAS, likely underlying most of her chronic issues, was identified.A 30-year-old chronically polymorbid woman presented with superior vena cava syndrome and was diagnosed with ScM. On further evaluation, MCAS was identified. Treatment promptly effected symptomatic improvement; sclerosis has been stable. Non-compliance yielded symptomatic relapse; restored compliance re-achieved symptomatic remission.Different MCAS presentations reflect elaboration of different mediators, some of which can induce inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, MCAS may have directly and/or indirectly driven ScM in these patients. MCAS should be considered in ScM presenting with comorbidities better explained by mast cell mediator release.",

PEComas arising in visceral organs outside of the kidney, liver, and lung are rare, and often pose problems in diagnosis. Examples of this neoplasm originating in the adrenal gland are limited. The present report details the clinical and pathologic features of an unusual case of a pure epithelioid PEComa (epithelioid angiomyolipoma) of the adrenal gland exhibiting clinically malignant behavior in the form of pulmonary metastases, a feature not previously described in tumors of this site. The diagnosis was supported by immunohistochemical studies demonstrating expression of myoid and melanocytic antigens. The present case serves to emphasize the potential of PEComa for clinically aggressive behavior and the importance of distinguishing this tumor from other epithelioid neoplasms that are more commonly encountered in the adrenal gland.",

Ultrasound showed enlargement of the uterus with a complex echogeneous area in the uterine cavity. Serum human chorionic gonadotropin was 67,611\u00a0mIU/ml. Total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy were performed. The uterus contained hemorrhagic and fragile tumor with grape-like vesicles in the enlarged endometrial cavity. Microscopic examination revealed hydropically degenerated villi with circumferential hyperplasia of atypical trophoblast and cistern formation. p57kip2 immnostaining was negative in villous cytotrophoblasts and stromal cells. Moreover, fluorescent in situ hybridization for HER2 was scored as diploid. These findings are consistent with complete hydatidiform mole. The diagnosis of hydatidiform mole must be considered in perimenopausal women, and the combination of p57kip2 immunostaining and HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization seems to be a very useful testing strategy for difficult situations regarding the differential diagnosis of completed and partial hydatidiform mole.",

While the vast majority of lung cancers are caused by cigarette smoking alone, smoking together with heavy drinking are the major etiological agents of head and neck cancer. In addition, human papilloma virus (HPV) has been identified as an important causative factor of tonsillar carcinomas. In contrast, chromosomal instability and aneuploidy identifiable by DNA measurement are predominately associated with cancer progression. This selective review summarizes our studies that aimed to gain a better understanding of the biology and pathology of lung cancer and head and neck cancer. In particular, it was attempted (a) to develop a microscopy-based tumor classification system that provides insight into the genetics of cancer cells and in particular their DNA ploidy, (b) to apply this classification system to lung cancer and head and neck cancer and to correlate it with clinicopathological parameters and molecular biomarkers, and (c) to analyze molecular characteristics and in particular the presence of human papilloma virus in lung cancer and head and neck cancer. Therefore, we developed a core classification based on the semi-quantitative assessment of the size and type of tumor cell nuclei and mitoses. It was found that (1) nuclear and mitosis size correlated with the DNA content of the tumor cells, (2) tripolar mitoses were indicative of cancer with near-triploid DNA content, (3) morphological and DNA parameters indicating variability of the cancer genome were associated with poor prognosis of lung cancer patients, (4) HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas were characterized by smaller tumor nuclei and reduced DNA amount compared to HPV-negative carcinomas, and (5) HPV is associated with lung cancer in certain geographical regions of the world.",

Although constitutive NF-\u03baB activation has been reported in many human tumors, the effect of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is still poorly understood. To explore the role of NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in ESCC, RNA interference (RNAi) was used to knockdown the NF-\u03baB p65 protein level in the ESCC cells and nude mice. 5-FU was used to investigate whether knockdown NF-\u03baB p65 can potentiate 5-FU's antitumor effect. Animal results indicated that tumor growth was inhibited in p65 siRNA and p65 siRNA\u00a0+\u00a05-FU groups as compared with the control group. Immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and TUNEL assay showed that p65 siRNA downregulated the expression of p65 and enhanced the sensitivity of EC9706 cells to 5-FU treatment in vivo. Overall, our work indicates that downregulation of p65 can increase tumor apoptosis and potentiates the effects of 5-FU by suppressing NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. Thus, p65 is an interesting target for ESCC treatment.",

Samples of brain, spinal cord and skeletal muscle (biceps femoris and gastrocnemius muscles) were collected. The neurological tests evaluated motor capacity, balance and pain sensitivity. At Day 5 PI in Subgroup A1, the rats showed high parasitemia, became apathetic and presented with slow movements and signs of disorientation. After Day 15 PI in Subgroup A2 and Day 30 PI in Subgroup A3, no more clinical abnormalities were observed. Histologically, there was no damage to the CNS in these three subgroups, but within Subgroup A3, mononuclear infiltration of the muscle was observed. Rats chronically infected (Subgroup A4 \u2013 Day 150 PI) showed muscle atrophy, walking dysfunction and paralysis of the hind limbs. Mild mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates and perivascular cuffs were observed in the CNS of some of the animals in Subgroup A4. In these rats, severe muscle damage was observed in the skeletal muscle which included atrophy and loss of muscle fibers, multinucleated giant muscle cells, mononuclear myositis, Wallerian degeneration of the innervating fibers and mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the perineurium and adipose tissue. Based upon these findings, we conclude that infection by T. evansi in rats leads to muscle damage, which is probably the cause of the paralysis of hind limbs.",

However, at present, pathological assessment is only possible as a postoperative examination. We performed quantitative evaluation of mycobacterial antigens using lung tissues with MAC pulmonary infection obtained from surgical resection. The distribution of mycobacterial antigens was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining with monoclonal antibody for mycobacteria. In exudative reactions, many monocyte-lineage cells containing mycobacterial antigens were observed in alveoli, whereas the quantity of mycobacterial antigens was extremely decreased in proliferative reactions. Epithelioid cells or multinucleated giant cells contained mycobacterial antigens in necrotic granulomas. In solitary nodules with central necrosis, mycobacterial antigens were frequently observed, whereas they were rarely observed in solitary nodules without caseous necrosis. Mycobacterial antigens were not observed in the epithelial layer of bronchioles in any cases, although proliferative granulomas were notably observed in the developed lymphoid follicles in subepithelial lesions of bronchiole. Thus, exudative reactions or nodules with caseous necrosis indicate the possibility of numerous mycobacteria remaining in the pulmonary focus. Therefore, intraoperative histological assessment may help in the determination of the area of surgical resection. This is the first study to quantitatively evaluate mycobacterial antigens according to histological characteristics in MAC pulmonary disease.",

Immunohistochemistry was used to study TP53 expression, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed for the detection of high risk HPV types (16 and 18).The frequency of HPV-16 and HPV-18 infection was 10.6% and 16%, respectively. Overexpression of TP53 was observed in 70.2% of patients. Young patients (aged below 45 years) comprised 20% of all patients. There was no significant association between TP53, HPV-16, or HPV 18 presence and higher stages of the tumor, tumor differentiation, or presence of nodal metastasis.Although an association between head and neck SCC and HPV infection is being recognized and reported, our data implicate that HPV infection or TP53 expression does not play a significant role in oral tongue SCC pathogenesis, differentiation, or metastasis, as seen in our patients.",

However, considerable uncertainty exists regarding which detection method can be applied in a reproducible, sensitive, and simple manner in the routine diagnostic setting. We compared the detection rates of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in 92 routine formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded CRC specimens by 2 discrete methods: direct sequencing and peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-mediated PCR. The detection rates for KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations by direct sequencing were 20.7%, 3.3%, and 1.1%, respectively. PNA-mediated PCR clamping significantly increased the percentages of KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations by up to 7.6%, 1.2%, and 5.4%, respectively, compared to the detection rate of regular PCR followed by direct sequencing (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039, p\u00a0=\u00a00.250, and p\u00a0=\u00a00.031, respectively).

Immunohistochemistry using a panel of antibodies, i.e., vimentin, desmin, myogenin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratins, factor VIII-related antigen, S100-protein, synaptophysin, chromogranin, Bcl2, MIB-1, leukocyte common antigen (LCA), CD 3, CD20, CD34, and CD 99 (MIC-2) was performed wherever applicable.Out of the 188 cases, 184 were primary cardiac tumors, including 170 cases of benign cardiac tumors. Among the benign tumors, myxomas were the most frequent ones (168 cases), followed by fibroma (2 cases). Primary malignancy was diagnosed in 14 cases, including undifferentiated sarcomas [6], primitive neuroectodermal tumor [1], rhabdomyosarcoma [2] non-Hodgkin lymphoma [2], angiosarcoma [1], synovial sarcoma [1], and leiomyosarcoma [1]. Metastatic (secondary) tumors were seen in four cases, including one each of adenocarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, and alveolar soft part sarcoma. Hence, out of the total of 188 cases, 20 were non-myxoma cardiac tumors (NMCTs), including 2 benign tumors, 14 malignant tumors, and 4 metastatic tumors.In our series, the majority of cardiac tumors were primary in nature. The malignant primary tumors outnumbered benign ones, excluding myxomas, and the most common malignant histology was undifferentiated sarcoma, as opposed to the literature.",

Dantrolene has been shown to be neuroprotective by reducing neuronal apoptosis after SCI. Furthermore, in addition to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, it appears to have a beneficial action on voiding, once this drug acts on the external urethral sphincter relaxation. In the present study, we investigated the effects of dantrolene on urinary bladder injury that follows experimental SCI. Forty-six male Wistar rats were laminectomized at T13, and a compressive trauma was performed to induce SCI. After euthanasia, the urinary bladder was removed for gross and histological evaluation. Traumatized animals showed urinary retention with severe hemorrhagic cystitis. Injured animals treated with dantrolene had less bladder hemorrhage and inflammatory infiltrate than those treated with placebo (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Our results demonstrate that dantrolene may protect against urinary bladder lesions that follow SCI. Treating spinal cord-injured patients with this agent may be a promising additional therapeutic strategy to alleviate the accompanying inflammatory process. The results of the current study show that dantrolene has protective effects on spinal cord contusion-induced urinary bladder injury. The impaired integrity of bladder morphology was ameliorated by dantrolene treatment.",

Herein, we present a rare case of a mixed tumor/myoepithelioma arising in the iliac bone of a young adult male who presented with swelling in his right hip. Radiological imaging disclosed a large, intraosseous, lytic, heterogenous mass with a soft tissue component. Biopsy and subsequent tumor resection showed an 18\u00a0cm sized tumor involving the iliac bone and soft tissues and comprising polygonal and spindly cells, arranged in cords and aggregates, embedded in a myxohyaline stroma with osteochondroid differentiation. Tumor cells exhibited mild nuclear variation, rare mitotic figures, focal cytoplasmic clearing, and prominent squamous differentiation. On immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor cells were diffusely positive for S100-P, EMA, CK5/6, p63, GFAP, calponin, and focally positive for CK/MNF116, but negative for Brachyury/T. Diagnosis of a myoepithelioma/mixed tumor was offered. Further, cytogenetic analysis revealed lack of EWSR1 gene rearrangement and showed clonal trisomies of 11, 15, 17 with del (16q) and del (22q11). The present case is a rare documentation of a myoepithelioma in the appendicular bones and the second such case identified in the iliac bone. IHC and cytogenetic findings supported a myoepithelial cell origin, and reinforced its relationship with a parachordoma and its distinction from mixed salivary gland tumors, a chordoma, and an extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma that form its differential diagnoses.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of Stratifin in human gliomas and to analyze its expression profile with respect to tumor development.The expression pattern of Stratifin was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and/or Western blotting in tumor samples from 186 patients with different grades of gliomas. Prognostic significance was assessed using Kaplan\u2013Meier survival estimates and Cox regression analyses.The expression pattern of Stratifin was correlated with the pathological and clinical characteristics of the patients with gliomas. Western blot analysis indicated that the average optical densitometry (OD) ratio of Stratifin in high-grade gliomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade III/IV) was lower than in low-grade tumors (WHO grade I/II, p\u00a0=\u00a00.026). In addition, statistical analysis showed that patients expressing a high level of Stratifin have favorable overall survival rates relative to those expressing a low level of this protein. Cox multi-factor analysis showed that Stratifin (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) was an independent prognosis factor for human gliomas.Our results provide convincing evidence that the expression of Stratifin is down-regulated in human gliomas.

We observed an absence of CD138+ cells in 25% of endometrial biopsies in which plasma cells had been identified by conventional methodology, while additional immunohistochemical analyses revealed indistinguishable inflammatory infiltrates among women diagnosed with acute or chronic endometritis by conventional criteria. Among women considered at lower risk for PID development, flow cytometric analyses detected plasma cells in 30% of endometrial biopsy specimens, suggesting that these cells, even when accurately identified, only nonspecifically identify upper genital tract inflammatory processes. Combined, our findings underscore the limitations of the criteria used to diagnose histologic endometritis in PID-related research and suggest that satisfactory understanding of PID pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention is hindered by continued use of these criteria.",

Viral presence has been evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry investigated on tumor tissues and their corresponding normal breast tissues collected from 123 Tunisian women with sporadic breast carcinomas. Viral status in tumors was then correlated with various clinicopathological parameters.Using specific PCR assays, EBV DNA was found in 33 (27%) out of 123 breast carcinoma cases. EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) in situ hybridization was negative in the neoplastic cells, but stomal lymphocytes were positive in 4 cases. Immunohistochemistry for latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) was negative in all cases. None of the normal breast tissues showed positive results for EBV using PCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry.A correlation was found between EBV DNA presence and the negativity of estrogen receptor (P\u00a0=\u00a00.008). However, no significant correlation was found for the other parameters investigated, including patient age, Scarff-Bloom\u2013Richardson (SBR) histological grade, tumor size, and histological node involvement.With regard to survival data, overall and disease-free survivals were shorter in EBV-positive breast carcinoma cases than in EBV-negative ones, but this difference did not reach statistical significance.Our study indicates the presence of EBV DNA in a significant proportion of breast cancer in Tunisia.

     "abstract": "A case of primary desmoplastic cutaneous leiomyosarcoma is reported. A flat and elevated tan plaque, measuring 30\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a020\u00a0mm, was noticed in the left back of a 74-year-old Japanese male 6 months before the resection. The biopsy specimen showed an overgrowth of desmoplastic fibrocollagenous stroma, focally admixed with a less cellular proliferation of spindle cells having mildly pleomorphic nuclei, but no mitotic figures, arranged in small clusters or appearing as individual cells. Based on these features, we interpreted it as a benign keloid-like lesion. A local resection was done, and gross examination revealed a poorly demarcated grayish tumor lesion, replacing the entire dermis and extending into the subcutis. Microscopic findings demonstrated a sparsely cellular proliferation of atypical spindle cells having cigar-shaped or multi-nucleated pleomorphic nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm with few mitotic hot spots, arranged in interlacing bundles, alternating with scattered tumor cells within an abundant desmoplastic stroma. Immunohistochemically, these atypical cells were positive for \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, HHF-35, desmin, and caldesmon, and MIB-1 labeling index was greater than 10%. Therefore, we finally made a diagnosis of desmoplastic leiomyosarcoma as a very rare variant of cutaneous leiomyosarcoma. We should be aware that owing to its characteristic features, pathologists might misinterpret it as benign when examining only small or inadequate specimens. It is thus suggested that a large panel of antibodies including smooth muscle cell markers and MIB-1 in immunohistochemistry are useful and adjunctive diagnostic aids for recognizing malignancy, especially in diagnostically difficult cases such as ours.",

A contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scan showed two solid round masses, one in each kidney, measuring 1.5 and 2\u00a0cm. The nephrotic syndrome was responsive first to prednisone and finally to cyclosporine. Pathological study of both renal dominant masses confirmed that they were oncocytomas.

     "abstract": "Recent advances in the understanding of molecular stomach carcinogenesis are reviewed. As to molecular events in individual mucin phenotypes of gastric cancer, the CDX2-Reg IV-SOX9 pathway is associated with the intestinal mucin phenotype, while OLFM4 and CLDN18 are novel markers for the gastric phenotype. microRNAs play an important role in epigenetic deregulation in gastric cancer. Many microRNAs are up-regulated and down-regulated, and some of these are associated with histological differentiation and cancer progression. Reduced miR-200 may participate in the genesis of diffuse type gastric cancer by reducing E-cadherin expression. Genetic polymorphism is a crucial endogenous cause and a fundamental factor of cancer risk. PSCA polymorphism alters the susceptibility to diffuse type gastric cancer through modulation of cell proliferation activity. Cancer stem cells possess the capacity for self-renewal and cause the heterogeneous lineages of cancer cells. Cancer stem cells also show resistance to anti-tumor chemotherapy. Only a minor population of gastric cancer cells reveals the properties of cancer stem cells, and CD44 is one of the markers for gastric cancer stem cells. The origin of gastric cancer stem cells remains to be elucidated.",

Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded gastric adenocarcinoma tissues from 87 patients, including adjacent normal tissues, were included on tissue microarray by immunohistochemistry. The tumor and the adjacent normal tissues were positive for FasL in 66.7% and 90.6%, for Fas in 52.8% and 52.4%, for FADD in 67.4% and 82.3%, for cleaved caspase 8 in 27.9% and 37.7%, and for cleaved caspase 3 in 33.7% and 8.3%, respectively. FasL and the FADD from tumor were statistically different in relation to the histological type. Cleaved caspase 8 was statistically different in relation to clinical stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.031). The FADD from normal tissue was statistically different in relation to age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.039), sex (p\u00a0=\u00a00.055), clinical stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019), and Fas was different in relation to tumor size (p\u00a0=\u00a00.012). In the tumor, we observed a correlation between FasL and Fas, FasL and FADD, and FasL and cleaved caspase 3. In the adjacent normal tissue, a correlation was observed between FasL and Fas, FasL and FADD. There was no association of another marker with sex, age, clinical stage, and survival. Our results suggest that these proteins mediate the early extrinsic apoptotic pathway in gastric cancer and adjacent normal mucosa. FasL protein binds to Fas protein and subsequently binds to death receptor FADD signaling activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. In this phase, there was inhibition of caspase 8 and, consequently, decreased apoptosis.",

In EC, both stromal and myometrial expressions of CD31 were significantly higher than in the controls (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.013; respectively). Stromal tryptase expression was not significantly lower than that of leiomyoma. In addition, in the leiomyoma group, CD31 and tryptase expressions were not much different compared to the controls. Moreover, a correlation was detected between cancer histological grade and both stromal and myometrial expressions of CD31 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.017 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.005; respectively). The findings show that high grade EC has a higher degree of vascularization than EC of lower grade, but MCD does not increase in parallel with the histological grade. This study has demonstrated that MCD does not correlate with angiogenesis and progression of grade in EC. Moreover, MCD in EC was found to be lower than in benign lesions of the uterus. In conclusion, MCs may not account for the angiogenic process which facilitates tumor growth.",

Pretreatment clinical staging was done according to the FIGO 2009 update classification. Biopsy tumor samples were used for flow cytometry analysis and histological examination. A prognostic study was performed using both Cox and Bayesian Weibull regression models.Eighty (50.3%) tumors presented DNA aneuploidy, mostly observed in adenosquamous (AS) cell carcinoma (8 of 9 cases) and adenocarcinoma (AC) (12 of 17 cases). The median SPF value (8.6%) was used for discriminating low vs. high tumor cell proliferation. High SPF significantly correlated with aneuploidy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). All AS carcinomas had SPF\u00a0>\u00a015%, while all ACs presented SPF\u00a0<\u00a010% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Forty-three (27%) patients died of the disease during follow-up.

Most advanced-stage NBs have proven refractory to many treatment modalities, and a fundamental alternative therapy, such as inhibition of biological pathways, is now being explored. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) has recently been identified as an activation mutation in familial or high-risk sporadic NBs. We examined the prevalence of the ALK mutation in 54 NB cases (23 pre-treatment cases and 31 cases for which specimens were available before and after treatment) and the presence of the ALK mutation in various pediatric tumors. We detected the ALK mutation (F1174C and R1275Q) in 2 (3.7%) of the 54 NB specimens. Both cases showed poorly differentiated and advanced-stage NBs. No ALK mutations were detected in other pediatric tumors. The frequency of the ALK mutation was somewhat lower than that expected in Korean patients with NBs. The mutation detected in the present study was one of the hotspot mutations, including positions of F1174 and R1275 reported previously.

In this study, we analyzed the entire coding sequences of human caspase-2 gene for the detection of somatic point mutations in 90 gastric carcinomas and 100 colorectal carcinomas by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\u2013single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Of the cancers analyzed, two gastric cancers (2/90; 2.2%) and two colorectal cancers (2/100; 2.0%) harbored somatic missense mutations of caspase-2. The mutations consisted of p.V46M (at prodomain), p.S157L (at prodomain), p.R357K (at p13 subunit), and p.R397L (at p13 subunit). We expressed these tumor-derived mutants in 293 T cells and found that three of the mutants decreased cell death activity of caspase-2. Our data indicate that somatic mutation of caspase-2 is rare in gastric and colorectal carcinomas. However, functional data of the caspase-2 mutations also suggest that caspase-2 gene mutation might affect the pathogenesis of some gastric and colorectal cancers by inactivating cell death function of caspase-2.",

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a newly described vascular network structure that was first described in aggressive melanomas. To find out whether VM also exists in astrocytomas and to examine its clinical significance, we studied 80 malignant astrocytoma samples using immunohistochemistry coupled with periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) staining. To explore the possible therapeutic methods of anti-VM formation, we cultured astrocytoma cells using three-dimensional Matrigel and investigated the effects of Endostar, an endothelial cell growth inhibitor, on astrocytoma cell growth, invasion, and VM formation. VM structures were found in 8 samples of malignant astrocytomas, seven of which were grade IV astrocytomas. Glioblastoma U251 cells cultured in Matrigel formed vessel-like loops and networks, mimicking the features of VM in vivo, whereas such structures were not found in cultured normal astrocytes or well-differentiated astrocytoma SHG44 cells. In addition, treatment with Endostar led to a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of proliferation and invasion of both U251and SHG44 cells, but VM formation by U251 cells in vitro was not prominently affected. In conclusion, VM is frequently detected in aggressive glioblastomas, and the presence of VM may constitute a new predictor for poor prognosis in astrocytoma patients. Although Endostar has broad anti-tumor effects due to anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor cell mechanisms, its inhibitory effects on VM formation by U251cells in vitro are not remarkable.",

Many processes have been proposed to explain the selective cerebral vulnerability and the focal neuronal cell death in Wernicke's encephalopathy. There are several mechanisms which are common to the pathophysiology of encephalopathies caused by thiamine deficiency (TD). Recently, emphasis is being placed on deficit in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays major roles in regulating brain damage and inflammation.Here we present two fatal cases of non-alcohol associated WE. The immunohistochemical study revealed increased proinflammatory cytokine immunoreactivity in the neurons of the mammillary bodies and medial thalamus, and in the periaqueductal regions, compared with basal constitutive levels of expression in the frontal cortex. Positive (WE cases) and negative (immediate trauma deaths) case-controls were used to confirm the results. TD induced IL-1\u03b2 proteins weakly, while moderate increase was observed for TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Immunofluorescence analysis by confocal microscopy confirmed the staining results for immunoreactivity in WE brains. Further, the induction of proinflammatory cytokine protein expression levels was quantified by Western blot analysis.",

     "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been accepted as an infective agent causing gastric carcinoma (GC). EBV-associated GC, comprising nearly 10% of all cases of GC, is the monoclonal growth of EBV-infected epithelial cells, which express only several EBV-latent genes (Latency I program). Histopathologically, there are two subtypes, lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma and the ordinary type of GC. Other features include the lace pattern of carcinoma cells in the intramucosal stage and the dense infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages at the invasive site of the submucosa. The primary molecular abnormality in EBV-associated GC is global and non-random CpG island methylation in the promoter region of many cancer-related genes. Experimental studies have demonstrated that viral latent membrane protein 2A (LMP2A) is responsible for the promotion of DNA methylation. LMP2A up-regulates cellular DNMT1 through the phosphorylation of STAT3, resulting in the repression of tumor suppressor genes, such as PTEN, through promoter methylation. DNA methylation in EBV-infected stomach cells may be due to overdrive of the cellular defense against foreign DNA. Further studies on the mechanisms of epigenetic abnormalities will clarify the strategies for prevention and treatment of this particular type of GC with EBV infection.",

     "abstract": "At upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to investigate unexplained diarrhea and iron deficiency anemia, duodenal biopsies are often taken to exclude a diagnosis of coeliac disease. While histology remains the gold standard for this diagnosis, recent developments in serological testing may overtake this as a first line test and biopsy restricted to confirming the diagnosis. Established coeliac disease on biopsy is straightforward, but early lesions may pose a challenge. Newer endoscopic procedures such as push\u2013pull enteroscopy (balloon enteroscopy) with biopsy allow access to the small bowel beyond the second part of the duodenum. Controversy remains as to what constitutes the normal histology of the duodenum, and small bowel. Lymphocytic duodenosis (increased intraepithelial lymphocytes with normal villous architecture) in patients with negative coeliac serology can be associated with Helicobacter pylori, drugs, autoimmune and other diseases including food allergy. Full thickness small intestinal biopsies can aid in investigation of enteric neuropathies in severe dysmotility disorders. Biopsies are also taken to investigate malabsorption due to suspected infectious and metabolic disorders. Despite highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), immunosuppressed patients may be affected by duodenal pathogens. The histology of duodenal mucosa in acid related disorders reflects the damage seen at endoscopy. Although the prevalence of duodenal ulcer disease is decreasing, drugs causing ulceration remain an important disease entity. Recent observations in functional bowel disorders suggest that the duodenum may be a key site for pathology. In functional dyspepsia, patients with early satiety may have excess eosinophil infiltration, and the mast cell is probably a key player in the irritable syndrome in the small intestine.",

In vivo delivery of siRNA-AAH reduced AAH expression and mean number of invasive trophoblastic cells at the implantation site. These adverse effects of siRNA-AAH were associated with impaired fetal growth and significantly reduced expression of Notch-signaling network genes.AAH is an important, positive regulator of trophoblastic cell motility, and inhibition of AAH in vivo leads to impaired implantation and fetal growth, and alters Notch-signaling mechanisms, similar to the effects of chronic ethanol exposure.",

     "abstract": "Sepsis is a potentially deadly complication that can be caused by different factors. Actually, it is known that oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of diphenyl diselenide (PhSe)2, an emergent compound, on oxidative stress parameters induced by sepsis in rats. Animals were pre-injected with (PhSe)2 or vehicle. Twenty-four hours later, sepsis was induced by cecal ligation puncture (CLP). After 12\u00a0h, liver was taken for thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) measurement, \u03b4-aminolevunic acid dehydratase (\u03b4-ALA-D), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities assay. The sepsis increased TBARS, inhibited \u03b4-ALA-D, activated Cu/Zn SOD and had a tendency to decrease CAT activity. However, (PhSe)2 prevented the TBARS formation, but did not prevent the inhibition of \u03b4-ALA-D activity in the animals with damage. Thus, this study showed that (PhSe)2 partially prevents the oxidative stress induced by sepsis, indicating the potential of this compound as a treatment for this pathology. Nevertheless, more tests should be performed to confirm the hypothesis suggested here.",

Cells undergoing EMT lose epithelial features and acquire mesenchymal markers and morphology. Cadherin expression switch (from E to N) is one of the first events in EMT.We investigated the immunohistochemical expression of E- and N-cadherin, vimentin, fibronectin, laminin-5-\u03b32, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and fibroblast-specific protein-1 involved in EMT in 20 IPF lung biopsies, focusing on metaplastic squamous cells of bronchial basal origin, positive for laminin-5-\u03b32 and \u0394Np63/p40, that cover FF. The results were compared with organizing pneumonia, reactive squamous cell metaplasia of bronchiolar epithelia, and squamous cell carcinoma.Bronchiolar basal metaplastic cells in IPF partially lost E-cadherin and expressed vimentin and fibronectin. Hyperplastic pneumocytes in IPF and controls coexpressed E-cadherin and N-cadherin, and were weakly positive for lam5-\u03b32. Reactive squamous cell metaplasia did not show any mesenchymal markers. Squamous cell carcinoma only expressed lam5-\u03b32.In IPF lungs, we observed two epithelial cell populations with a different expression profile of markers involved in EMT. Although neither hyperplastic pneumocytes nor bronchial basal cells showed evidence of complete EMT, only the latter seem to be specific for UIP and might have a role in its development.",

The biological role of YKL-40 has not yet been fully unveiled, however, its participation is perceived in angiogenesis, growth, proliferation, differentiation, and remodeling processes. The primary goal of our study was to evaluate possible differences in tissue immunoexpression of YKL-40, assumed between high grade and low-grade ovarian cancers and between the above-mentioned cancer types and benign lesions. Another purpose was to find out whether immunoexpression of the studied protein could correlate with the tumor proliferation process, evaluated by Ki-67 immunoexpression.The analysis comprised 45 women, diagnosed and treated for epithelial ovarian tumors at the Medical University of Lodz between 1997 and 2002. YKL-40 protein immunoexpression was semiquantitatively assessed, whereas immunoexpression of Ki-67 was evaluated using a computer image analysis system. Significantly higher immunoexpression values of both examined proteins were observed in high-grade serous ovarian cancers vs. low-grade and benign tumors. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was identified between the immunoexpressions of YKL-40 and Ki-67 proteins in the studied groups of tumors.In conclusion, the obtained data suggest an overt prominence of TKL-40 tissue immunoexpression of YKL-40 in high-grade serous ovarian tumors, which could then be approached as a helpful, additional marker to identify more aggressive ovarian cancers.",

On the 28th day, the fifth lumbar DRG and sciatic nerve were removed. Volume of the ganglion, mean cell volume, total volume of DRG cells (A- and B-cells), and total surface of DRG cells, total number, diameter, and area of the myelinated nerve fibers were estimated using stereological methods. Except for the volume of the ganglion, all other parameters were decreased after nerve crush. In curcumin-treated rats, these parameters decreased, but to a lesser extent, and the values were significantly higher than in the non-treated SNC group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.04).It can be concluded that in rats after crush, curcumin has a protective effect on the DRG and sciatic nerve.",

These tumors often exhibit a plasmablastic morphology, a finding which prompted our interest in looking for ALK fusions in plasma cell neoplasms. We studied 46 cases of extramedullary plasmacytoma by immunostaining with anti-ALK antibody and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis using an ALK break-apart probe and found one case to be ALK protein-positive and demonstrated the disruption of the ALK gene in this case. Immunohistochemistry showed that the tumor cells were strongly positive for CD138, VS38c, and epithelial membrane antigen, but lacked expression of CD20, CD79a, CD45, and CD30.

Although increasing awareness points to the sites of involvement by perineurioma possibly being as ubiquitous as those frequented by schwannian tumors, only one intracerebral example has been described to date. We report on a surgically resected perineurioma of the falx cerebri in an 86-year-old woman. Preoperative imaging showed an enhancing extraaxial mass of 6\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a05.7\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03.7\u00a0cm. Histologically, the tumor consisted of a proliferation of spindle cells interwoven by a lattice of basal lamina. Alongside a prevailing soft tissue perineurioma pattern, sclerosing and reticular areas were seen as well. Tumor cells coexpressed EMA and GLUT-1, and a minority immunoreacted for smooth muscle actin. Pericellular basal lamina was decorated with collagen type IV. No staining for S100 protein was detected. Mitotic activity was virtually absent, and the MIB1 labeling index averaged 2%. Ultrastructural examination revealed abundant pinocytotic vesicles within and conspicuous tight junctions between slender cytoplasmic processes which, in turn, were encased by discontinuous basal lamina. FISH analysis confirmed loss of at least part of one chromosome 22q. This observation calls attention to perineurioma as a novel item in the repertoire of low-grade meningial spindle cell neoplasms, in the differential diagnostic context of which it is apt to being misconstrued as either meningioma, solitary fibrous tumor, or neurofibroma. Confusion with the latter bears the risk of overgrading innocuous features of perineurioma as criteria for malignancy.",

RT-PCR identified transcription of both RON and MSP in all nine cases that were available for the examination. Immunohistochemistry showed the expression of RON (9/14 cases) and MSP (9/14 cases). Six cases out of 14 were positive for both RON and MSP. Normal Merkel cells were negative for RON and MSP expression. Missense mutation in the tyrosine kinase region of RON was detected in one of the 14 cases, and the case showed expression of RON.

To estimate the impact of chromosome 17 centromere assessment on routine practice, we conducted a retrospective re-classification study.Four hundred and five consecutive cases were selected. The original molecular pathology reports were available. Centromere 17 copy counts were ignored in the reassessment.Altogether, nineteen (4.69%) discrepant cases were found, from which five (1.23%) were considered originally non-amplified but had an HER2 copy number >6. Therefore, we reclassified them as HER2-amplified, while fourteen (3.46%) cases were originally considered amplified with 6 or fewer HER2 signals/cell.The discrepant cases found in our reassessment study would require further high-resolution genetic analysis to resolve the disagreement. On the other hand, our result also highlights that for the vast majority of breast cancer cases traditional FISH examination is still adequate to reach the correct diagnosis. This diagnostic gap must be filled by more sophisticated genetic examinations. Moreover, upcoming HER2 guidelines should consider the aid that high-resolution karyotyping can give to the diagnostic algorithm.",

A variable NGAL immunoexpression was demonstrated in 17 of the 48 analyzed cases with a significantly higher frequency of positive cases among patients showing disease progression. NGAL expression was also positively correlated with VEGF expression detected in the same cases. MMP-9 immunostaining was present in the cytoplasm of the neoplastic cells in 30 cases; no significant correlations were evidenced with NGAL expression, as well as with the various clinico-pathological parameters or with progression of the colorectal carcinomas. By contrast, NGAL expression was confirmed as a significant independent negative prognostic marker related to a shorter disease-free survival in stage I colorectal carcinoma. Our preliminary results suggest that the association of NGAL with poor outcome might be independent from MMP-9 regulation, thus highlighting its prognostic value in this neoplasia. If our findings are confirmed in further analyses, NGAL assessment might be used in order to select those patients with a higher progression risk and to submit them to adjuvant therapies useful to prevent adverse outcome.",

Sometimes, the process may be inaccurate or inconclusive especially in early diagnosed cases. With the availability of p57KIP2 immunostaining (the product of a strongly paternally imprinted and maternally expressed gene), it may be possible to classify these lesions objectively. P57KIP2 immunostaining is absent in CHM because it lacks a maternal genome, whereas PHM and HA show positive staining. The aims of this study were to evaluate the results of routine histopathological examination and p57KIP2 immunoreactivity in a large series of molar and nonmolar HA in Tunisia, and to compare the accuracy of p57KIP2 immunohistochemistry with that of nuclear DNA microsatellite polymorphism in identifying CHM. The immunohistochemical expression of p57KIP2 protein was investigated in 220 specimens of first trimester hydropic abortuses, and it was compared with the original diagnosis based on morphology, including 132 CHM, 49 PHM, and 39 HA. Concordant results were obtained in 210 cases. In 9 of 10 cases with a discordant diagnosis (negative immunostaining in 8 cases morphologically diagnosed as PHM and one case diagnosed as HA), microsatellite DNA genotyping analysis agreed with the results of p57KIP2 staining, confirming the diagnosis of CHM in these cases. Twenty cases of CHM with negative p57KIP2 immunostaining were also analyzed by genotyping and indicated the absence of maternal contribution and the homozygosity for a single paternal allele in concordance with the androgenetic and monospermic origin of CHM in these cases. We confirm that for distinguishing CHM from its mimics, p57KIP2 immunohistochemistry can be used as successfully as DNA microsatellite genotyping. However, molecular techniques are still required for the evaluation of some difficult cases with discordant positive p57KIP2 staining.",

We investigated tissue samples, including 117 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDCa), 14 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 15 cases of intraductal hyperplasia (IDH) from breast tissues. The expression of CD44, CD24, HIF-1\u03b1, and VEGF was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining.

Obstructive phlebitis was observed. Immunohistochemically, numerous IgG4-positive plasma cells were observed, and the IgG4/IgG ratio was 75.9%. The serum level of IgG4 examined at post-operation was high. These findings suggested that this lesion was consistent with IgG4-related sclerosing mesenteritis.",

While most cases of ALK+ ALCL have the common pattern characterized by anaplastic morphology with hallmark cells, a less common but well-recognized variant with a small cell pattern may pose a diagnostic challenge. We report a case of ALK+ ALCL with small cell morphology and CD8 subset restriction in a 53-year-old male patient who presented primarily with multiple recurrent subcutaneous nodules with histopathologic features simulating a subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (SPTCL). The case was initially diagnosed as SPTCL but was reconsidered as ALK+ ALCL when the incidental finding of CD30 positivity on a subsequent biopsy prompted an ALK immunostain, which turned out to be positive in the neoplastic T-cells. The diagnosis of ALK+ ALCL, small cell variant, was then confirmed by detection of an ALK gene rearrangement by FISH analysis. This report highlights a case of ALK+ ALCL with a deceiving clinical and histopathologic presentation, and emphasizes the value of immunohistochemical panel studies and genetic tests in such cases to avoid diagnostic errors.",

The present study aimed to investigate the distribution and clinical significance of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in hepatic angiomyolipoma (AML). We performed immunohistochemical staining for endothelial cell markers (CD34 and podoplanin) on 80 cases of sporadic hepatic AMLs. Microvessel density (MVD) and lymphatic vessel density (LVD) were determined in intratumoral and peritumoral regions and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues. All hepatic AMLs showed positive staining for CD34 and podoplanin. Intratumoral and peritumoral MVDs and LVDs were significantly higher than those in adjacent liver tissues (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No statistical difference in both MVD and LVD was found between intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Large tumors (>5\u00a0cm) had a significantly increased MVD and LVD as compared with smaller tumors. A significant positive correlation was found between average LVDs and MVDs (r\u00a0=\u00a00.567, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and LVDs were a relatively lower event as compared with MVDs. Double immunostaining revealed that no neoplastic cells positive for HMB-45, an antibody reacting with melanosome-associated antigen, were concurrently immunoreactive for endothelial cell markers. In conclusion, intratumoral and peritumoral angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis commonly occur in hepatic AMLs, thus representing potential therapeutic targets for this disease.",

Its role in the serrated neoplasia pathway(s) seems well established. Data on prevalence rate, demography, and some polyp characteristics remain, however, to be firmly established. Nor has its relation to SPs with subtle aberrant features, falling short of definite SSL-histology, been sufficiently addressed.The aim of this study was to highlight variables that may influence recorded data on SSL and to further discuss the appropriate place of SPs that possess histological attributes intermediate between traditional hyperplastic polyp (HP) and SSL, termed borderline SSL (BSSL).Upon review of 8.324 consecutive colorectal polyps signed-out as HP, 219 SSLs and 206 BSSLs were segregated, using strict predetermined criteria.Predominant left-sidedness and equal gender distribution characterized the present series, though right-sided SSLs occurred significantly more often in older subjects with a trend toward more females. The lower age of patients with SSL/BSSL in the last part of the study reflects the increased focus on hereditary neoplasm. BSSL differed from SSL only by a smaller polyp size.Discordant SSL-data can be ascribed primarily to diversities in endoscopic procedure, though tissue handling, the criteria used, and study design may contribute. A precursor status of BSSL to SSL is an attractive, though still unsubstantiated thesis.",

Therefore, we focused on the effect of BPs on cellular aggressiveness of malignant bone tumors at low concentrations. MTS assay was performed using osteosarcoma cell lines MG63 and HOS, fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, and prostate cancer cell line PC3. All the cell lines showed toxicity at high concentrations. On the other hand, at lower concentrations, the cellular viabilities of HOS and MG63 were rather higher than those of untreated controls. Since this tendency was most evident, HOS was used for further assays, including cellular motility, bone resorption activity, and cathepsin K activity. The low-concentration of alendronate enhanced cellular viability and motility, which correlated with the expression of connexin 43 at the mRNA and protein levels. Interestingly, oleamide, a potent connexin 43 inhibitor, had an inhibitory effect on the enhanced proliferation. Our data suggest that alendronate may enhance the proliferation of osteoblastic cell line through connexin 43 activation.",

The aim of this study was to investigate associations of DUSP6 expression with expression of ERK and Ki-67 and with clinicopathological parameters in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. A total of 102 squamous cell carcinomas and 66 adenocarcinomas were studied using immunohistochemistry for DUSP6, ERK1/2, and Ki-67. In 66 adenocarcinomas, high DUSP6 expression was positively correlated with ERK1/2 expression. High DUSP6 expression was correlated with lower histological grade and lower Ki-67 index in the adenocarcinomas. In 102 squamous cell carcinomas, high DUSP6 expression was correlated with lower ERK expression, with greater smoking pack-years, but not with the Ki-67 index. These results indicate that DUSP6 acts as a negative feedback regulator of ERK in adenocarcinoma progression, but that DUSP6 does not play a role in the downregulation of ERK in squamous cell carcinoma. The differential expression of DUSP6 correlated with Ki-67 index, suggesting that DUSP6 plays an important role in cancer resistance in different subtypes of non-small cell lung carcinoma.",

The aim of this study was to see whether alterations of ATG5 protein expression and somatic mutation of ATG5 gene are features of human gastrointestinal cancers. In this study, we analyzed ATG5 somatic mutation in 45 gastric, 45 colorectal, and 45 hepatocellular carcinomas by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP). Also, we analyzed ATG5 protein expression in 100 gastric, as well as in 95 colorectal and hepatocellular carcinomas using immunohistochemistry. Overall, we detected two somatic missense mutations of ATG5 gene in the coding sequences p.Leu112Phe and p.His41Tyr. The mutations were observed in one gastric and one hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunohistochemically, ATG5 protein was well expressed in normal stomach, colon, and liver epithelial cells, while it was lost in 21 (21%) of the gastric carcinomas, in 22 (23%) of the colorectal carcinomas, and in 5 (10%) of the hepatocellular carcinomas. Our data suggest that ATG5 gene could be altered in gastrointestinal cancers at the mutational or expressional level. Despite the low incidences of the alterations, our data led us to conclude that somatic mutation and loss of expression of ATG5 gene might play a role in gastrointestinal cancer pathogenesis by altering autophagic and apoptotic cell death.",

The analysis included 40 T1a,b cancers with, and 112 T1a,b cancers without axillary lymph node metastases. The basic morphological features of cancers were investigated histologically, while hormone receptors and HER2/neu were investigated immunohistochemically with an additional CISH analysis of HER2/neu 2+ cases. The ploidy and S-phase fraction were determined by DNA flow cytometry. The association of the investigated features with the likelihood of axillary lymph node metastases was analyzed by univariate and multivariate analysis.The univariate analysis showed that lymph node metastases were associated with tumor size (T1a/T1b; p\u00a0=\u00a00.026), histological type (ductal/non-ductal; p\u00a0=\u00a00.014), lymphovascular invasion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), HER2/neu expression (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), ploidy (p\u00a0=\u00a00.027), and combined values of ploidy and S-phase fraction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.025).

The lesions were mostly composed of clear cells, while the peripheries of the lesions had typical oncocytic cells with abundant fine granules. The histological existence of the clear cell component in the lesions led to misdiagnoses of other clear cell neoplasms. However, this case had multiple nodules in bilateral glands. No evidence of malignant histological findings was found. Moreover, the clear cells, as well as the oncocytic cells, were demonstrated to have mitochondria and glycogen in their cytoplasm using special staining.

     "abstract": "Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) ranks second in the frequency of all skin tumors. Its incidence has risen significantly due to an increased sun exposure and the number of immunocompromised patients. It has a well-defined progression with known precursor lesions called actinic keratosis. The degree of cellular differentiation, tumor thickness, location, and other features has prognostic value. It has a better prognosis than mucosal SCC of the head and neck, also called head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).Ultraviolet light plays a fundamental role as an initiator and promoter of carcinogenesis of SCC, allowing the accumulation of genetic alterations that allows a selective growth advantage. The TP53 (p53) gene often mutates and Ras is frequently activated, but with low frequency of mutations. Normally, the extracellular signals determine whether the cells move from a quiescent state into an active proliferative state. In tumor cells an increase in the production of growth factors and its receptors can be often seen that gives rise to such an autocrine circuit facilitating cellular division. Recently, frequent mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been detected in lung cancer, mainly deletions in exon 19 and L858R mutation in exon 21. These are located at the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain (TK). EGFR TK mutations produce activation of the signaling pathways downstream and preferentially activated antiapoptotic pathways (PI3K/AKT, JAK-STAT and ERK/MAPK). These mutations are correlated with the clinical response of patients to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (gefinitib and erlotinib), because the tumor cells are addicted to the constant activation of specific signaling pathways. Glioblastoma shows another EGFR mutation (EGFRvIII), corresponding to a deletion of the extracellular domain, and it is present in 24\u201367% of these tumors. This variant has been found in 42% of HNSCC, related to the poor response to monoclonal antibody cetuximab.Many observations show that there are abnormalities in the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and/or its ligands in HNSCC with frequent activation of multiple pathways downstream EGFR, and unrelated to RAS mutation. This suggests the possibility of activation by mutation or overexpression of a component of the pathway located upstream-Ras. While in other tumors, especially lung cancer and glioblastoma, the EGFR mutations are frequent genetic events, it is unknown whether EGFR is mutated or amplified in SCC of the skin and what would be its pathogenic role in this malignancy and its precursors.",

Specimens with hepatic granulomas were reexamined by a designated pathologist. Type and localization of granulomas, size of granulomas and epithelioid histiocytes, and the morphological findings of surrounding liver tissue were recorded in an attempt to establish a correlation with relevant clinical, laboratory and radiological findings.Out of 1420 liver biopsy/resected specimens evaluated at our institution during the study period, 86 cases of epithelioid cell granulomas (6.05%) were observed. Of the 86 cases, 23 were men and 63 were women. The most common underlying etiology was PBC in 38 patients, infections in 34, malignancies in five, sarcoidosis in four, and foreign bodies in three patients. One case (1.2%) of a drug-induced hepatic granuloma was encountered, while another case was deemed idiopathic (of unknown etiology). Contrary to common belief, granulomas were observed not only in early stage PBC but also in cases with stage 3 disease. Out of all the PBC cases with granulomas, 55.6% had stage 3 disease, and besides periductal granulomas, intraacinar granulomas were also seen. For sarcoidosis, intra- and peri-granulomatous fibrosis was observed in as many as 75% of cases. A large majority of granulomas (82.4%) associated with infections were of the necrotizing type.Extensive evaluation of the morphological characteristics of hepatic granulomas and surrounding liver tissue along with clinical, radiological, and other laboratory findings may help arrive at an accurate diagnosis in a majority of cases. Rather than being a final diagnosis, the presence of hepatic granulomas entails the need for further investigations towards identifying the underlying etiology, with a pathologist being at the center of the diagnostic process.",

     "abstract": "This study aimed at determining whether virtual microscopy improves the accuracy in the pathological examination of prostate needle biopsies regarding maximum tumor length, percentage of positive cores, and Gleason grading.We assessed a series of 816 prostate needle biopsy cores in 68 consecutive patients with prostate adenocarcinoma. Biopsy specimens were reviewed using conventional examination. Then, slides were converted to whole slide imaging (Olympus BX51). Tumor was measured, and Gleason score was assigned using the OlyVia software. Optically evaluated pathological features were compared with digital findings to determine whether one of these two methods for the assignment of a preoperative Gleason score is appropriate for predicting the definitive Gleason score of radical prostatectomy.When comparing optical and digital measurements, maximum tumor length in biopsy cores and percent prostate needle biopsy with cancer showed no significant difference. The mean variation in the measurement of tumor length was 2.65\u00a0mm per biopsy. Among 240 biopsy cores involved with cancer, the concordance rate for Gleason score assignment was 75.8% (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.49, good agreement). When considering the higher Gleason score assignment as the score for the entire case (ISUP 2005), the concordance rate was 69.1% (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.46, good agreement). When comparing the biopsy scores with the definitive score of radical prostatectomy, the concordance rate was significantly increased from 54.4% for conventional examination (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.23, marginal agreement) to 66.2% for virtual slide examination (\u03ba\u00a0=\u00a00.42, good agreement).Virtual microscopy does not compromise, but might improve, the accuracy of grading in prostate needle biopsies.

This study investigated the effect of ORP150 on appearance and function of pancreatic beta cells in ANP.Acute necrotizing pancreatitis relied on retrograde infusion of 5% sodium taurocholate into the bile-pancreatic duct. The severity of ANP was estimated by serum amylase, secretory phospholipase A2, and pancreatic histopathology. The changes in appearance and function of pancreatic beta cells were detected by light and electron microscopy and the levels of serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide. ORP150 expression was studied using western blot and immunohistochemisty assay.The expression of ORP150 mainly appeared on pancreatic beta cells and decreased gradually during the pathogenesis of ANP. The results of light and electron microscopy indicated pancreatic beta cell dysfunction and death, concomitant with elevation of serum glucose, insulin, and C-peptide in ANP.These results imply a probable role of ORP150 in the changes in appearance and function of pancreatic beta cells following acute necrotizing pancreatitis, through the pathway of endoplasmic reticulum stress.",

Imprint smears obtained from 124 tumors were studied immunocytochemically, and results were correlated with prognostic markers. There were 112 ductal and 12 lobular carcinomas. The positivity of UCP4 was correlated with lymph node metastases (p\u00a0=\u00a00.005), positive ER and PR expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 for both), as well as positivity for p53 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and Ki-67 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001).

We investigated the esophageal lesions in MCTD histopathologically, and analyzed relationships between these lesions and autoantibodies extracted from the serum of MCTD patients. Esophageal tissues from 27 MCTD patients submitted to autopsy were examined. We compared histopathological features of the esophagus in different wall layers from the mucosa, submucosa, and muscular layer to the adventitia, and in the upper, middle, and lower portions of esophagus. The most striking change observed was severe atrophy and occasional loss of smooth muscle cells in the muscular layer, followed by fibrosis. These muscular changes were particularly prominent in the inner layer of the lower esophagus. Immunohistochemically, degenerated muscular tissues of the esophagus were positive for anti-IgG and anti-C3 antibodies, but not for anti-IgM antibodies. IgG fractions extracted from three MCTD patients were immunohistochemically used to examine whether some antibodies in MCTD patients showed reactivity for esophageal components. The IgG fractions isolated from MCTD patients reacted with smooth muscle from non-connective tissue disease cases, suggesting that some serum antibodies may trigger esophageal changes. These findings suggest that esophageal lesions associated with clinical dysphagia in MCTD may be related to autoantibodies.",

Twelve samples of MDA, eight samples of lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), and 20 normal control cases were included in this study. Typical lesions and less well-differentiated lesions coexisted in 11/12 mucinous MDA samples. Positive cytoplasmic expression for IMP3 and CEA was found in less well-differentiated lesions of all 11 mucinous MDA samples, primarily with strong to intermediate staining intensity. The typical well-differentiated lesions of all 12 MDA cases and 8 cases of LEGH showed negativity for both IMP3 and CEA. No exact p16INK4a positivity was observed in 12 mucinous MDA and 8 LEGH. The significant expression of IMP3 and CEA in less well-differentiated foci of mucinous MDA may be helpful in the diagnosis of mucinous MDA to some extent, particularly in small specimens from cervical biopsy. More cases and in-depth researches are needed to elucidate the potential different mechanisms between typical and less well-differentiated lesions of mucinous MDA.",

Unfortunately, the terms IMT and IPT are still used interchangeably, especially when lesions occur in unusual sites, including breast. All the cases of IMT/IPT involving the breast have raised spontaneously without any apparent prior injury. We herein report the first case of a post-traumatic IPT of the breast parenchyma in a 22-year-old male. Histologically, the lesion was highly cellular and composed of spindle cells arranged in a predominant fascicular pattern. Notably, mono- or multi-nucleated large pleomorphic cells were observed. Inflammatory cells, especially plasma cells and lymphocytes, were closely admixed with the spindle cell proliferation. The overall picture was reminiscent of an \u201cIMT with atypical features\u201d, typically seen in lung, abdomen, pelvis, and retroperitoneum of children. Immunohistochemically, the spindle-shaped and large pleomorphic cells were immunoreactive to vimentin, \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and desmin. No immunoreactivity was obtained with ALK-1 protein. The present case contributes to widening the morphological spectrum of IPT of the breast, emphasizing the possibility that a reactive lesion may contain large pleomorphic cells that may represent a potential diagnostic pitfall. Lastly, we suggest that the diagnosis of IMT of the breast should be rendered with caution when dealing with ALK-negative spindle cell lesions in adult patients, and alternative diagnoses, including IPT, should be seriously considered.",

Microscopically, tumor cells proliferated in trabecular or cord-like arrangement, which was considered as \u201chepatoid appearance\u201d. An adenocarcinomatous component was intermingled. The expressions of liver-enriched transcription factors, hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1\u03b2, HNF-3, HNF-4\u03b1, and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)-\u03b2, were investigated in the present case and in 19 cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma (11 cases of Grade 2 and 8 cases of Grade 3), because these nuclear factors are involved in embryonal hepatogenesis. HNF-4\u03b1 was diffusely positive in the present case, but negative in all cases of endometrioid adenocarcinoma. HNF-3 and C/EBP-\u03b2 were positive for the present case and control adenocarcinoma cases (HNF-3, 36.8% and C/EBP-\u03b2, 84.2%). HNF-1\u03b2 was negative for both the present case and endometrioid adenocarcinomas. This is the first report to demonstrate HNF-4\u03b1 expression in this rare uterine tumor.",

Experimental models suggest the existence of two functional types of Treg cells designated naturally occurring and induced. Interest in Treg cells increased with evidence from experimental mouse and human models demonstrating that the immunosuppressive potential of these cells can be utilized in the treatment of various pathological conditions. The existence of a subpopulation of suppressive T cells was the subject of significant controversy among immunologists for many years. T regulatory cells limit immune activation through a variety of direct and indirect interactions, many of which are yet to be determined. Fully understanding Treg cells biology will lead us to harnessing the capacity of these cells in order to develop strategies to prevent autoimmune disorders and tolerance to transplantation. Efficient isolation, expansion and cryopreservation strategies that comply with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) guidelines are prerequisites for the clinical application of human CD4+ CD25+ CD127low FOXP3+ regulatory T cells.",

They included 7 cases of T2/T3 disagreement and 2 cases of T3/T4 disagreement. In addition, we discussed the issue of potential T1/T2 discrepancy (however, we did not observe any such a case). Another inconsistency was related to the application of different stage prognostic groupings between both systems. In conclusion, the discrepancies between ENETS and AJCC\u2013UICC staging systems for pNENs are relatively frequent and heterogeneous. We believe that they should be rigorously recognized.

This study was undertaken in order to determine whether GADD45\u03b2 is expressed with C/EBP\u03b2 in aging articular cartilage. We also investigated whether the synergistic expression of GADD45\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b2 may be involved in the mechanism of chondrocyte senescence. Senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP1) were used as a model of aging. GADD45\u03b2, C/EBP\u03b2, and p21 were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. A luciferase reporter assay using ATDC5 cells was performed in order to examine p21 as a target gene of the GADD45\u03b2/C/EBP\u03b2 cascade. GADD45\u03b2 exhibited increased expression in the aging articular cartilage of SAMP1 mice compared to that in control mice. The co-localization of GADD45\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b2 was confirmed by double immunostaining. The synergistic mechanisms of GADD45\u03b2 and C/EBP\u03b2 on the gene regulation of p21, a molecule related to cellular senescence, were verified by a p21-luciferase reporter assay. Co-expression of C/EBP\u03b2 and p21 was confirmed.

The performance of the presented software in such application was verified by comparing the data provided by visual analysis, by two observers previously calibrated and under supervision of two experienced specialists (Group 1) and by the computer program (Group 2). No statistical difference was observed (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) between the two groups. The use of the proposed method in AgNOR applications permitted attainment of accurate and precise data without the difficulties frequently found in the traditional visual analysis method (time, training and subjectivity).

Clinical data were obtained from the patient records. The histological grading system of malignancy proposed by Bryne (1998) [9] was used for the analysis of morphological parameters. The results were analyzed statistically by \u03c72 test (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Galectin-1 expression was observed in 87.7% of cases and was significantly correlated with metastasis (p\u00a0=\u00a00.033) and clinical stage (p\u00a0=\u00a00.016).

We measured IHC utilization by pathologists performing 609 consecutive non-medicolegal, hospital-based, adult autopsies over a three-year period. IHC requests on non-neurologic and neurologic material were analyzed separately. Total stains, number of tissue blocks, specific antibody requests, resident trainee involvement, and ordering pathologist were recorded. For all autopsies on which IHC was requested, the final autopsy report was reviewed. IHC was requested on 345 cases (57%), and a total of 4612 stains were performed (mean 13.5 per autopsy). For non-neurologic autopsy tissues, IHC was used most commonly for the accurate diagnosis of malignancy. For neuropathologic autopsy examinations, IHC was employed most commonly to exclude neurodegenerative conditions and correlate ante-mortem clinical neurologic findings. Resident involvement did not significantly impact utilization. Individual pathologists demonstrated a wide variation in IHC utilization. We conclude that IHC is used extensively in Canadian non-medicolegal autopsy pathology reflecting the complexity, extent, and severity of disease in patients dying in a tertiary-care, academic hospital setting. Utilization is strongly influenced by the neuropathology component of these autopsies. The results provide a point of reference for IHC utilization in autopsy pathology.",

In the face of such differential diagnostic breadth, recognizing cytoplasmic lucency as part of the morphological spectrum of some low grade gliomas will directly have an impact on patient care. We describe a prevailing clear-cell change in an epileptogenic left temporal pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma surgically resected from a 36-year-old man. Mostly subarachnoid and focally calcified, the tumor was composed of fascicles of moderately atypical spindle cells with optically lucent cytoplasm that tended to intermingle with a desmoplastic mesh of reticulin fibers. Immunohistochemically, coexpression of S100 protein, vimentin, GFAP, and CD34 was noted. Conversely, neither punctate staining for EMA nor positivity for CD68 was seen. Mitotic activity was absent, and the MIB1 labeling index was 2\u20133% on average. Diastase-sensitive PAS-positive granula indicated clear-cell change to proceed from glycogen storage. Electron microscopy showed tumor cell cytoplasm to be largely obliterated by non-lysosomal-bound pools of glycogen, while hardly any fat vacuole was encountered. Neither ependymal-derived organelles nor annular lamellae suggesting oligodendroglial differentiation were detected. The latter differential diagnosis was further invalidated by lack of codeletion of chromosomal regions 1p36 and 19q13 on molecular genetic testing. By significantly interfering with pattern recognition as an implicit approach in histopathology, clear-cell change in pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma is likely to suspend its status as a \u201cclassic\u201d, and to prompt more deductive differential diagnostic strategies to exclude look-alikes, especially clear-cell ependymoma and oligodendroglioma.",

We determined the immunopathological characteristics of IRIS associated with Mycobacterium parascrofulaceum infection in an AIDS patient. A patient presented with pulmonary lymphadenitis and involvement of the pulmonary lingular segment. Portions of the involved lymph nodes and lung were excised, and the immunological properties were analyzed by immunohistochemical assays. The histological characteristics of lymph nodes showed a caseous necrosis. Histopathologically, the pulmonary lesion was composed of exudative and proliferative lesions. CD4+, CD8+, CD57+, and CD25+/FoxP3+ cells were observed in both types of lesions. Clusters of CD20+ cells and GATA3+ cells were predominantly observed in exudative lesions, while T-bet+ cells were dominant in proliferative lesions. ROR-\u03b3+ cells were also observed in exudative lesions. These results indicate that the cellular immunity to mycobacteria was recovering in the lung tissue. In M. parascrofulaceum pulmonary infection, the exudative lesion had characteristics of Th2 and Th17-type immunities. In contrast, the proliferative lesion had characteristics of Th-1 type immunity.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of stimulation with pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines on the L-selectin surface expression on PMN.Twenty patients admitted to our institution for elective operations of the lower extremities were enrolled in a prospective clinical study. For the measurement of L-selectin expression, blood was taken before the operation (0\u00a0h), as well as 24\u00a0h and 48\u00a0h postoperatively. Without and after incubation with different pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-10), the surface expression of L-selectin was detected using an anti-L-selectin-specific antibody and flow cytometry.L-selectin surface expression without any stimulation showed a non-significant increase 48\u00a0h after the operation (63.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.6\u00a0ng/ml at 0\u00a0h, 95.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.5\u00a0ng/ml at 48\u00a0h).

The second type was encountered in 15 of 84 cases (18%) in the esophagus, and in 20 of 74 cases (27%) in the duodenum. The first type appeared to be of congenital origin, while the second type was reminiscent of foveolar metaplasia. Foveolar hyperplasia and mild lymphocytic infiltration were frequent in the heterotopic gastric mucosa. Goblet cell metaplasia was recognized in 11 cases.

The first experimental group, under restriction from the age of 2 weeks, was fed 80% ADL. The second experimental group was fed 65% ADL from the age of 2 weeks. There were 16 animals in each group. The experiment lasted 5 weeks. Liver parenchyma samples were obtained at the age of 35 days by the necropsy method and then processed by standard histologic methods. The slices were stained by standard staining: hematoxylin\u2013eosin and by Sirius red kit for collagen type I and reticulin visualization. Hepatocyte diameter and the proportion of interstitial tissue to the parenchyma of the liver were measured objectively. Microvesicular liver steatosis was observed after 35 days of restriction. Hepatocyte diameter was significantly influenced by sex, genotype, and the experimental group. The proportion of interstitial tissue to the liver parenchyma was highly influenced by genotype and group, but there were no interactions. An increase in the steatosis histologic grade is associated with inflammatory changes, with decrease of hepatocyte diameter and with a decreasing proportion of interstitial tissue to the liver parenchyma. The results show that early restriction is not associated with the development of fibrosis of the liver tissue.",

     "abstract": "Cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and cytokeratin 20 (CK20) are low molecular weight cytokeratins. The expressions of CK7 and CK20 have been studied in various primary and metastatic carcinomas. Their expression patterns may help to distinguish the site of origin of metastatic carcinomas. We investigated the expressions of CK7 and CK20 in 196 cases of colorectal carcinoma. Paraffin sections of 196 colonic adenocarcinomas were randomly selected, retrieved, and immunostained for CK7 and CK20 with a standard avidin\u2013biotin complex method. CK7 was expressed in 34/196 (17.3%) and CK20 in 159/196 (81.1) cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma. CK7\u2212/CK20+ had the greatest proportion (65.8%) in colorectal carcinomas. The CK7+/CK20+ immunophenotype was identified in 30/196 (15.3%), CK7\u2212/CK20\u2212 in 33/196 (16.9%), and CK7+/CK20\u2212 in 4/196 (2%) colon adenocarcinomas. The CK7 and CK20 expression patterns were different in colorectal carcinomas according to histological grade, location of the tumor, and lymph node metastasis. CK20 positivity was more common in low grade carcinomas than in high grade carcinomas (85.1% versus 47.6%) and in rectal and sigmoid carcinomas than in proximal colon carcinomas (88.2% versus 63.2% and 88.9% versus 63.2%, respectively). Furthermore, CK7 expression was more common in tumors with lymph node metastasis than in non-metastatic tumors (25.3% versus 11%). In conclusion, a considerable number of colorectal carcinomas showed reactivity to CK7 (17.3%) or no reactivity to CK20 (18.9%). Therefore, CK7 positivity or CK20 negativity does not rule out a colorectal origin of metastatic carcinoma.",

Thus, the prognostic relevance of various molecular factors was analyzed. It has recently been postulated that gene amplification of serine threonine kinase 15 (STK15) in normal urothelium is of prognostic value in muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The aim of the present study was the validation of these findings.We retrospectively analyzed amplification of STK15 gene in normal urothelium of 68 patients having undergone radical cystectomy for urothelial bladder carcinoma of the bladder at our department between 1998 and 2006 with available paraffin specimens. A tumor micro array (TMA) was constructed, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed. Signals of chromosome 20 and STK15 gene were counted using fluorescence microscopy.Specimens of 48 patients could be evaluated. The median follow-up was 20 months [2\u2013106 months]; disease-specific death occurred in 7 patients (15%). There was no amplification of STK15 gene in normal urothelium of cystectomy specimens.In contrast to the preceding study, the present data show no STK15 gene amplification in normal urothelium of cystectomy specimens. Prediction of the oncological outcome warrants further research of different markers.",

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the relationship of immunohistochemical COX-2 expression with clinicopathological parameters, including HER-2/neu overexpression in invasive breast carcinoma (IBC).Our study population comprised 10 normal breasts, 25 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 51 invasive breast carcinomas.

She underwent partial resection of the right upper lobe and left lower lobectomy. Histopathological examination revealed that both tumors were composed of medium to large complex glands with central necrosis. The tumor cells were cuboidal to tall columnar with eosinophilc cytoplasm, oval nuclei, and brush-border. Immunohistochemical study yielded the following results: tumor cells were diffusely positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and CDX-2, and negative for CK7, thyroid transcription factor-1, and Napsin A. MUC2 was partially observed, while MUC5AC was not detected. These findings were strongly indicative of metastatic colorectal carcinoma. However, no primary colorectal cancer was detected in any clinical examination, including fluorine 18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scan and video capsule endoscopy, and she has not presented with any characteristic symptoms at any follow-up to date, approximately 4 years after operation. From all features, the final diagnosis was primary PAED, suggestive of multifocal primary lung cancer. So far, only 1 case of CK7-negative PAED has been reported.

A 72-year-old Japanese female was noticed to have right renal and left adrenal tumors by an abdominal CT scan. At surgery, the mildly enlarged left adrenal gland contained a well-demarcated tumor. Macroscopically, it was yellowish to dark red or grayish in color, and was characterized by geographic appearance on the cut surface. Histopathological examination revealed a solid proliferation of clear or compact cells and a normal rim of adrenal gland, coexisting with vascular multiple cysts and myelolipomas. The cysts were filled with clotted blood, fibrinous material, or thrombi, and were partially lined with flattened endothelial cells with focal papillary hyperplasia, which were immunohistochemically positive for CD31 and CD34. These cystic walls were often thickened with hyalinized fibrosis and calcification, and were connected to myelolipomatous elements. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of adrenocortical adenoma associated with myelolipoma and endothelial cysts.

In a previous series, we have shown that cyclin D-1 was over-expressed in subsets of apocrine metaplasia (APM) and apocrine adenosis (AA) of the breast and that such over-expression was mostly associated with a significant increase in the proliferative capacity of these lesions. We examined the mechanisms involved in cyclin D-1 over-expression in apocrine lesions.A total of 41 cases were analysed in this study. The cases were divided into: 18 cases of APM and 23 cases of AA. All cases analysed had been previously analysed by immunohistochemistry, and all showed over-expression of the cyclin D-1 protein. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was performed using a dual cyclin D-1 (spectrum orange)/chromosome 11 centromere (spectrum green) DNA probe.

In our cases, there were important vascular phenomena that resulted in hemorrhage and thrombosis, but without marked decrease of platelet count and coagulation cascade disruptions.

On the other hand, the expression of versican in the cases of classic lobular in situ carcinomas that we selected for the study was confined to the anatomical structures that usually contain the proteoglycan in adult breast tissues. In our cohort, versican synthesis was found to be associated with spindle-shaped elements with myofibroblastic phenotype, as in the stroma of invasive carcinoma. These data, taken together with evidence from previous studies on proteins strongly related to versican, suggest that various histotypes of breast in situ carcinomas could follow different pathways of epithelial stromal interactions. In particular a category of in situ lesions shows constituents of desmoplastic stroma before the manifestation of the morphological signs of invasion.

Autopsy revealed large tumors in the spleen, 3 medium sized tumors in the lungs, and several small tumors in the liver. Microscopic studies of the splenic tumors revealed a hepatocellular carcinoma which showed a strongly positive reaction against anti-PIVKA-II and anti-\u201chepatocyte\u201d antibodies. Several bile ductules thought to be heterotopic remnants of the liver tissues were found in the capsule of the spleen, adjoining the splenic tumor. It was suggested that the tumor originated from one of these ductules. Electron microscopic analysis showed numerous endocrine-like granules of every tumor cell, and 87\u2013165 times stronger mRNA expression of insulin-like growth factor-II was measured in the tumor tissues when compared with normal liver tissue.

We retrospectively examined the receptor status and the histological grade in Chinese DCIS patients to identify any independent predictor in order to discriminate a subgroup with coexisting invasion from pure DCIS patients. A consecutive Chinese DCIS patient cohort registered at a single institution was included for ER, PR, and HER2 status, as well as for evaluation of the histological grade. Patients with invasion foci >1\u00a0cm in diameter were excluded. The HER2 gene amplification status was further examined by FISH when the IHC result was HER2 (2+). Molecular subtypes were also profiled. Age, histological grade, ER, PR, and HER2 status were included in association analyses. In total, 183 patients were included. A hundred and forty patients had pure DCIS, and 43 patients had DCIS with invasion. The luminal A subtype accounted for 49.7% of all cases, the HER2-positive subtype for 27.9%, and only 10.4% and 12.0% represented the luminal B and basal-like subtypes, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that histological Grade 2, Grade 3, and HER2-positive status were associated with DCIS with invasion, odds ratios 5.1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.017), 5.2 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and 3.34 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.001), respectively.

The 43 cases with invasion were further stratified into extensive or small DCIS components according to the percentage of DCIS to total tumor area using 25% as the cutoff point. Multinomial logistic regression with pure DCIS cases as reference showed that the HER2-positive status was associated only with the group showing an extensive DCIS component, odds ratio 6.2 (95%CI 1.8\u201321, P\u00a0=\u00a00.003), but not with the group having a small DCIS component.

To address this problem and obtain a definite diagnosis, needle core biopsies are often performed, leading to an increased need for supportive ancillary techniques in the histopathological assessment of highly differentiated hepatocellular tumors. Here we evaluate the diagnostic value of immunohistologically detected Annexin A2 (ANXA2) expression in highly differentiated liver tumors. ANXA2 is a calcium-dependent phospholipid-binding protein that has been linked to malignant transformation and HCC development. Our data show that adding sinusoidal ANXA2 expression to the already established marker panel (GPC3, GS, and HSP70) increases the accuracy for the detection of well-differentiated HCC (74% sensitivity, 100% specificity). In addition, in our series, the combinations ANXA2-GPC3 and ANXA2-GS performed better compared to the other established marker combinations. In conclusion, we suggest that adding ANXA2 to the established diagnostic marker panel increases the reliability and objectivity of HCC diagnosis in liver biopsies.",

Recent studies have revealed that stromal-derived MMP-1 acts as a signaling molecule by cleaving PAR1 to cause tumor migration and invasion of various cancers. However, the involvement of MMP-1/PAR1 signaling pathway in the progression and prognosis of human gliomas remains to be identified.Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression patterns of MMP-1 and PAR1 in biopsies from 108 patients with primary gliomas. Kaplan\u2013Meier survival and Cox regression analyzes were performed to evaluate the prognosis of patients.Immunostaining revealed MMP-1 to be expressed in 83.3% (90/108) and PAR1 in 76.9% (83/108) of the biopsies. PAR1 expression was significantly correlated with that of MMP-1 (r\u00a0=\u00a00.786, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). The total IHC scores for MMP-1 and PAR1 were significantly higher in high-grade tumors than in low-grade tumors (both p\u00a0=\u00a00.001). In addition, patients with high MMP-1 and high PAR1 expression have lower Karnofsky performance scale (KPS) scores than patients with low MMP-1 and low PAR1 expression (both p\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Moreover, MMP-1 and PAR1 expression was shown to be a strong prognostic marker for decreased overall survival (p\u00a0=\u00a00.002 and 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, Cox multi-factor analysis showed that KPS (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008), WHO grade (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), MMP-1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.006), and PAR1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.008) were independent prognostic factors for human gliomas.Our results suggest that in gliomas, the upregulation of MMP-1 and PAR1 correlates with histological malignancy grade and clinical outcome.

Immunohistological expression of CD147 (extracellular inducer of matrix metalloproteinase, EMMPRIN) and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) was studied in 22 EAC and the results compared between the \u2018conventional\u2019 neoplastic glands, foci of MELF-type invasion, and in the tumor-associated stroma. The conventional tumor areas showed strong membranous expression of CD147, and staining was more consistently present toward the central (luminal) aspect of the larger glands. In contrast, the tumor cells showed only focal expression of MMP2, and in some cases CD147 and MMP2 staining was inversely correlated. The neoplastic epithelium within MELF areas usually was negative for both CD147 and MMP2. However, there was consistent MMP2 expression in the reactive stroma that characteristically surrounds foci of MELF pattern invasion. This micro-anatomical variation in protein expression within EAC suggests a functional alteration in the neoplastic epithelium during the invasive process. It is likely that stromal MMP2 plays a role in potentiating invasion in these tumors but this may be regulated by factors other than CD147.",

In this study, we investigated the expression of CCR10 and its ligand CCL27 in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). CCR10 and CCL27 were expressed in SCC, actinic keratosis (AK), Bowen's disease, and seborrheic keratosis (predominantly prickle cell type), but not in seborrheic keratosis (predominantly basal cell type) and basal cell carcinoma. Furthermore, CCR10 and CCL27 were overexpressed in SCC relative to Bowen's disease, an early stage of SCC. Consistently, a human SCC cell line, A253 cells, and HaCaT cells exhibited CCL27 production that was strongly induced by tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-1\u03b2.

We describe an anaplastic ependymoma (WHO grade III) with a prevailing oncocytic component that was surgically resected from the right fronto-insular region of a 43-year-old female. Preoperative imaging showed a fairly circumscribed, partly cystic, contrast-enhancing mass of 2\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0cm\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01.7\u00a0cm. Histology revealed a biphasic neoplasm wherein conventional ependymal features coexisted with plump epithelioid cells replete with brightly eosinophilic granules. Whereas both components displayed an overtly ependymal immunophenotype, including positivity for S100 protein and GFAP, as well as \u201cdot-like\u201d staining for EMA, the oncocytic population also tended to intensely react with the antimitochondrial antibody 113-1. Conversely, failure to bind CD68 indicated absence of significant lysosomal storage. Negative reactions for both pan-cytokeratin (MNF 116) and low molecular weight cytokeratin (CAM 5.2), as well as synaptophysin and thyroglobulin, further assisted in ruling out metastatic carcinoma. In addition to confirming the presence of \u201czipper-like\u201d intercellular junctions and microvillus-bearing cytoplasmic microlumina, electron microscopy allowed for the pervasive accumulation of mitochondria in tumor cells to be directly visualized. A previously not documented variant, oncocytic ependymoma, is felt to add a reasonably relevant novel item to the differential diagnosis of granule-bearing central nervous system neoplasia, in particular oncocytic meningioma, granular cell astrocytoma, as well as metastatic deposits by oncocytic malignancies from extracranial sites.",

We also observed a reduction in the number of plasma cells, hepatic stellate cells, and fibrosis in patients who had successfully been treated and had a second liver biopsy post-treatment.Our findings support that the number of plasma cells can be a surrogate marker for the severity of liver disease, reflecting the number of hepatic stellate cells and the amount of fibrosis. It remains to be seen if this is a result of a direct interaction between the plasma cells and hepatic stellate cells or the response to the same stimulus that affects both cellular types.",

Malignant transformation of glandular epithelial cells is associated with the altered expression of mucin. We investigated the type of mucins expressed in CC.Twenty-six patients with histologically confirmed CC were included in this study. The expression of mucin was studied by immunohistochemistry using antibodies to MUC1, MUC1 core, MUC2, MUC3, MUC4, MUC5AC, and MUC6.There was extensive (>50%) expression of mucin, mainly MUC1 in 11/25 and MUC5AC in 12/26 cases. In the case of MUC3, 6/26 cases expressed mucin extensively, whilst only 1/26 had MUC2, MUC4, and MUC6 expression. Well-differentiated tumors significantly expressed MUC3 extensively compared to poor or moderately differentiated tumors (p\u00a0=\u00a00.003). Fifteen of 25 cases had metastatic disease. MUC1 was extensively expressed in 9/15 cases with metastatic disease. In contrast, MUC1 expression was present in 2/10 cases where metastases were absent. Hilar lesions were less likely to express MUC1, but this was not statistically significant. Fifteen of 25 cases had metastatic disease.Extensive MUC3 expression was significantly associated with well-differentiated tumors, whilst there was an approaching significance between the extensive expression of MUC1 and metastasis in cholangiocarcinoma.",

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of the Ki-67/MIB-1 labeling index (LI) in human meningiomas by a search in the literature. In PubMed/Medline databases, 53 articles were found, and they all showed positive correlations between Ki-67/MIB-1 LI and histological malignancy grade. The average mean labeling indices were 3%, 8%, and 17% for grade I\u2013III meningiomas, respectively. There was, however, considerable overlap of indices between the malignancy groups. Concerning recurrence, meningiomas with a labeling index beyond 4% may indicate an increased relapse rate. Consequently, Ki-67/MIB-1 LI represents a useful predictor of tumor grade and risk of recurrence, however, it must be interpreted cautiously in the individual tumor.",

Decreased numbers of PC12 cells were caused by PTH(1-34)-induced apoptotic and cytotoxic processes, as determined by DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)-leakage assays. Upregulation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and p38 signaling pathway was the underlying mechanism responsible for 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM PTH(1-34)-induced apoptosis in PC12 cells, as elucidated by Western blotting analysis and confirmed with ERK and p38 inhibitors. Furthermore, 1.0\u00a0\u03bcM PTH(1-34)-induced apoptosis was accompanied by a release of cytochrome c and subsequent caspase-3 activation. These data suggest that a high concentration of PTH(1-34)-induced cytotoxicity and apoptosis in PC12 cells was associated with upregulation of ERK and p38 through a mitochondria-mediated apoptotic pathway.",

It is unclear whether their presence correlates with clinicopathological features of invasive micropapillary carcinoma (IMPC) of the breast, an unusual subtype of breast cancer with a high incidence of lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis. CD44 and CD24 expression was determined by double-staining immunohistochemistry in 103 cases of IMPC and in 94 cases of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). The prevalence of CD44+/CD24\u2212/low tumor cells was higher in IMPC than in invasive ductal carcinoma IDC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.018). The CD44+/CD24\u2212/low tumor cells were also detected in adjacent stroma surrounding the micropapillary structure in 53.4% (55/103) of IMPC, but only in 7.4% (7/94) of stroma of IDC. These tumor cells in stroma of IMPC were positive for vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin, and negative for E-cadherin. The CD44+/CD24\u2212/low tumor cells in the micropapillary structure of IMPC were associated with those in stroma (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000). Moreover, they were both associated with lymphovascular invasion and extranodal extension, respectively (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The proportion of CD24+ tumor cells was also higher in IMPC than in IDC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.035), and the CD24+ tumor cells were associated with lymph node metastasis in IMPC (P\u00a0=\u00a00.010). The results suggest that the increased proportion of CD44+/CD24\u2212/low tumor cells and CD24+ tumor cells and the epithelial mesenchymal transition may play an important role in aggressiveness and high metastatic risk of breast IMPC.",

Under the preoperative diagnosis of bronchogenic cyst, he underwent right lower lobectomy at the age of 11 months. The resected specimen contained a 5.5-cm septate cystic lesion. Microscopically, the lesion consisted of a large cystic space and interconnected slit-like spaces surrounding bronchovascular islands. The cyst was lined by a monolayer of flat cells with focal multinucleated giant cells. Immunohistochemically, the cells lining the cystic lesion were positive for D2-40, Prox1, CD34, and CD31, and weakly positive for VEGFR-3, but were negative for AE1/3, HMB45, VEGF-A, VFGF-C, VEGFR-1.

Among the angiogenesis immunomarkers defined to date, endoglin (CD105) has been shown to be a useful marker of angiogenesis. To investigate the degree of angiogenesis status in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) tissue, we assessed 35 cases of SCLC at autopsy using immunohistochemical staining of CD31 and CD105. The intratumoral area, peritumoral area, and background pulmonary alveoli were then observed under low magnification, and the microvessel density (MVD) for each area was determined. The MVD-CD31 was the highest in the background alveoli, followed by the intratumoral and peritumoral areas. The MVD-CD105 was highest in the intratumoral area, followed by the peritumoral area and the background lung. The ratio of CD105/CD31 revealed that almost 78% of the intratumoral area, 63% of the peritumoral area, and 4.6% of the background lung alveoli were newly formed and expressed CD105. This result indicated that SCLC is predominantly supported by newly formed vessels that are generated by CD105-mediated angiogenesis. These findings suggest that anti-angiogenic therapy, especially CD105-targeting, may prove an effective form of SCLC treatment.",

Previously, we detected OX40 expression in breast carcinoma cell lines and tissues.

The expression of OX40 and OX40L in 107 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCa), 9 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS), and 31 fibroadenomas from breast tissues and its relationship with the clinical features were determined using immunohistochemistry (peroxidase-conjugated polymer method, ChemMate\u2122 Envision\u2122 Detection kit). The positive immunostaining rates for OX40 in IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenomas from breast tissues were 85.0%, 66.7% and 38.7% respectively, showing a significant difference in OX40 expression among IDCa, DCIS and fibroadenoma of breast (z\u00a0=\u00a05.206, P\u00a0=\u00a00.001).

Ovarian luteinized thecoma lacks definitive criteria for malignancy. Based on our case study of a mitotically active neoplasm without nuclear atypia in which the patient was living and well 19 years after operation and comparison with prior studies of luteinized thecoma and the closely related entity of cellular fibroma, we propose presumptive criteria for malignancy for this rare neoplasm. Increased mitotic activity in luteinized thecoma without significant nuclear atypia is not an indication of malignant behavior, and such cases should therefore be referred to as mitotically active cellular luteinized thecoma. We also contrast neoplasms in the luteinized thecoma category with the entity originally reported as luteinized thecoma associated with sclerosing peritonitis. In the latter, the ovarian stromal proliferations are typically bilateral, can have an exceedingly high mitotic rate as was seen in our illustrative case, often incorporate non-neoplastic ovarian structures at their periphery, and are responsive to medical therapy. In our patient with sclerosing peritonitis, both the ovarian masses and peritoneal sclerosis underwent complete regression following treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and high doses of steroids, and an ovarian biopsy taken 2 months after therapy showed a histologically normal ovary. The patient subsequently became pregnant and delivered a normal infant. This is, to our knowledge, the first case of successful medically conservative treatment of a young patient with this entity that led to complete relief of symptoms and allowed preservation of fertility. Because recent observations support the non-neoplastic nature of the ovarian stromal proliferations, we advocate use of the previously proposed term luteinized thecomatosis associated with sclerosing peritonitis for this entity.",

The arithmetic means for MVD were statistically analyzed using the Student's t-test and the significance level was calculated at P-value <0.001.The results indicate a direct correlation between upregulation of iNOS/VEGF in high-grade tumors. For MM, an increase in MVD is also correlated with a high-grade.

The PIK3R1-shRNA was successfully synthesized and cloned into the plasmid vector pGenesil-1, and specifically suppressed PIK3R1 expression at both the mRNA and the protein level. After transfection into HS-PHT-M\u03a6 and Con-M\u03a6, PIK3R1 knockdown inhibited the viability of M\u03a6, reduced the phagocytic rate, the rate of antigen-presenting positive cells, the metabolic rate, and the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and decreased the expression and activity of NF-\u03baB.Our data showed that the knocking down of PIK3R1 with shRNA produced by pGenesil-1 led to inhibition of viability and to decreased activity of M\u03a6 associated with HS-PHT in vitro. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that PIK3R1 might play a considerable role in the pathogenesis of HS-PHT, and inhibition of PIK3R1 expression might be a novel therapeutic strategy for HS-PHT.",

HPV was analyzed by consensus PCR followed by a hybridization method for virus typing. Static DNA cytometry was applied on single cell suspension focusing particularly on the parameters DNA modal value, DNA index peak, DNA index mean, 2c deviation index and 5c exceeding rate. Statistical analysis was done by T-test or Fisher's exact test.The analysis revealed that HPV positive HNSCC had significantly smaller nuclei than HPV negative cases.

These results confirmed the paternal origin of all three copies of chromosome 13, and the isodisomy for each chromosome was consistent with duplication of a monospermic fertilization event and subsequent non-disjunction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only case of an androgenetic complete mole with trisomy 13 described in the scientific literature.

To identify aberration profiles characteristic of World Health Organization (WHO) grade I, II, III, and IV astrocytoma, we performed a meta-analysis of detailed genome wide CGH data of all 467 cases published so far. After expansion of all given aberrations to the maximum of 850 GTG-band resolution, the frequencies of genetic imbalances were calculated for each chromosomal band, separately for all four WHO grades.Low-grade astrocytoma has already demonstrated one characteristic of glioblastoma multiforme, gain of chromosome 7 with a hot spot at 7q32, but without loss of chromosome 10. In anaplastic astrocytoma, a more complex aberration pattern emerges from diffuse genetic imbalances. Gains of 7q32\u2013q36 and 7p12 become the most frequent aberrations at chromosome 7. In glioblastoma multiforme, coarse aberrations like +7, \u22129p, \u221210, and \u221213 represent the most frequent aberrations as a characteristic pattern. In contrast to lower tumor grades, glioblastoma multiforme demonstrates +7p12 as the most frequently affected band on chromosome 7.To quantify the gradual transition from WHO grade II\u2013IV astrocytoma, we calculated the relative increase and decrease in frequency for each detected aberration of the tumor genome. The most pronounced and diverse changes of genetic material occur at the virtual transition from low-grade to anaplastic astrocytoma. Further transition to glioblastoma multiforme is characterized by gain of 1p, chromosome 7, and loss of chromosome 10.Summing up, the expansion of the CGH results to the 850 GTG-band resolution enabled a meta-analysis to visualize WHO grade-specific aberration profiles in astrocytoma.",

Analysis of chromosome DNA imbalance may help to advance diagnosis, grading, and classification, and to determine appropriate therapeutic approaches for tumors of astrocytic lineages. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) provides comprehensive information about chromosome DNA aberrations, and is an important technique for evaluating the differences at genomic levels among the same or different grade tumors. In this study, 63 astrocytic tumors of Chinese patients were screened by CGH, and the relationship between their chromosome DNA imbalances and the histopathological classification, grading, and clinical features was analyzed. Most tumors showed genomic copy aberrations detected by CGH. The most frequent abnormalities were regional gains in chromosome 1q and 7p; regional losses in chromosome 1p, 2q, 4q, 6p, 10q, 12q, 15q, 19q, and 22q were also frequently observed. The gain of 1q and the loss of 15q were relevant to the histological types and grades of WHO classification. The losses of 4q and 10q correlated with age in the group of anaplastic astrocytoma, which was unreported in the literature. This study confirmed that chromosomal aberrations, such as +1q, \u22124q, \u221210q, +7p, and \u221215q possibly contributed to the pathogenesis of these tumors.

Its histological features include widespread tumor emboli of the small arteries and arterioles of the lung, associated with thrombus formation and fibrocellular and fibromuscular intimal proliferation. Although PTTM has drawn increased attention as a fatal complication of gastric carcinoma (GC), comprehensive studies are still lacking. In order to clarify clinical and pathological features of GC-induced PTTM, recent autopsy cases were analyzed with a review of the literature. Of 36 autopsy cases with GC, 6 (16.7%) were affected by PTTM. Four were male and 2 female, with a mean age of 72.7 years. Three patients presented with PTTM-related clinical manifestations and died of PTTM. They showed clear morphological evidence of PH. The other 3 patients had PTTM as an incidental finding irrespective of clinical manifestations or PH. No patient was diagnosed antemortem as PTTM. All PTTM cases were associated with advanced GC, with a histology of adenocarcinoma of poorly differentiated type (n\u00a0=\u00a04) or signet-ring cell type (n\u00a0=\u00a02). Expression of tissue factor and vascular endothelial growth factor was confirmed immunohistochemically in tumor cells in all cases. The results were all in line with previous studies. In addition, the current study revealed vascular lesions characteristic of PTTM morphology to be present exclusively in the lung. In conclusion, our study shows a 16.7% incidence of PTTM in GC patients, with half of them developing PH and dying of PTTM, confirming a clinical significance as a non-negligible lethal complication of GC. In addition to many known clinicopathological characteristics of PTTM, the current study pointed to some PTTM issues requiring clarification, including the pathogenesis of the exclusive pulmonary distribution of vascular lesions of PTTM. Since details remain to be elucidated, interdisciplinary research is a high priority with a close collaboration between pathologists and clinicians in order to overcome this lethal condition.",

Among 1254 sudden death autopsies performed during the study period, 688 cases were recognized as sudden cardiac death (79.8% males). The estimated annual frequency of sudden cardiac death in the region of Epirus was 18.6/100,000. The major cause of death was ischemic heart disease (82%), and in 2.6%, death was unexplained.

Importantly, as current evidence also suggests a role of MAPK's (mitogen activated protein kinases) in cell cycle checkpoint control, we describe in this review both the ATR/ATM-Chk1/Chk2 signaling pathways as well as the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints by MAPK's as molecular mechanisms in DDR, and how their dysfunction is related to cancer development. Moreover, since damage to DNA might be the common underlying mechanism for the positive outcome of chemotherapy, we also discuss targeting anticancer treatments on cell cycle checkpoints as an important issue emerging in drug discovery.",

In esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the examination of DCs using immunohistochemistry (IHC) with anti-S100 antibody has demonstrated an increased infiltration of DCs into the tumor mass, however, the distribution patterns of DCs at different maturation states in ESCC are not fully evaluated. In this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the DC maturation status by examining the S100-positive DCs, CD1\u03b1-positive immature DCs (iDCs), and CD208-positive mature DCs (mDCs) and their distribution patterns in 45 ESCCs and 10 control tissues. The IHC analysis showed that the number of S100-positive DCs was increased in both the cancer epithelium and tumor stroma. Further phenotypic analyses revealed that intraepithelial DCs in the cancer mass were predominantly CD1\u03b1-positive iDCs. Whereas DCs presented in the tumor stroma were exclusively CD208-positive mDCs, CD208-positive mDCs were particularly dense in the margin of cancerous lesions and formed clusters with CD3-positive lymphocytes. The number of CD208-positive mDCs in the tumor mass was significantly lower than the number of CD1\u03b1-positive iDCs. The current results suggest that ESCC tissue comprises a high frequency of iDCs in the cancerous epithelium and a low density of mDCs in the tumor stroma. Such a distinct distribution pattern may reflect the ongoing DC tracking in ESCCs.",

The purpose of this study was that we could stratify primary testicular lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell type according to this scheme, and further elucidate the reason why primary testicular diffuse large B-cell lymphoma possesses a poor clinical outcome. Seventeen Chinese patients with primary testicular DLBCL were examined by means of a 3-antibody panel (CD10, Bcl-6, MUM1). Among these 17 cases, 16 were assigned to the activated B-cell-like subtypes. One case was classified as germinal center B-cell-like type. Twelve of these 17 cases expressed high proliferative activity (\u226540% Ki-67 labeling). The majority of primary testicular DLBCLs have activated B-cell-like subtype characteristics and high proliferative activity.

     "abstract": "Death-associated protein kinase (DAPK) has pro-apoptotic functions and participates in various apoptotic systems. DAPK acts as a tumor suppressor, and its inactivation by promoter hypermethylation has been frequently observed in various human cancers. As alterations of pro-apoptotic genes might cause instability in the balance of cell-turnover during chronic inflammatory processes, epigenetic silencing of DAPK might be involved in the carcinogenesis of ulcerative colitis-associated carcinoma (UCC). To evaluate the role of DAPK in the inflammation-driven carcinogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), we analyzed promoter hypermethylation and protein expression of DAPK using methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry in 43 UCCs and paired UC-background mucosa, as well as in UC-background mucosa of 50 patients without UCC. The frequency of methylation of DAPK in UCCs was low (27.6%) compared to overall non-neoplastic UC-background mucosa (48.3%; p\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and sporadic colorectal carcinoma (57.4%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). The difference in the methylation frequency in UC-background mucosa in patients without UCC (54.2%), compared to those with UCC (40.0%), was not significant (p\u00a0=\u00a00.141). Promoter methylation correlated significantly with decreased DAPK protein expression (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and severity of inflammatory activity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.024). In unmethylated UC-background mucosa, DAPK protein expression increased with activity of UC-associated inflammation, suggesting a protective role of the pro-apoptotic DAPK during the chronic inflammatory process of UC. Thus, inactivation of DAPK by promoter hypermethylation might be crucial for accumulation of DNA damage in inflamed mucosa of UC, and might therefore contribute to the initiation of the neoplastic process and development of UC-associated carcinoma.",

Myocardial samples obtained from 10 normal hearts were used as controls. An immunohistochemical method was performed with the use of desmin, N-cadherin, p53, and bcl-2 antibodies.The expression of desmin and N-cadherin was much more pronounced in dilated cardiomyopathy, and both of them were arranged disorderly. On the other hand, increased expression of p53 is associated with progressive loss of myocytes by apoptosis in heart failure, and increased expression of bcl-2 represents a possible compensatory antiapoptotic mechanism.The increased amount and the irregular distribution of desmin and N-cadherin in dilated cardiomyopathy may compensate for the loss of cellular stability due to the loss of contractile material.

The selection of future appropriate regimens must critically depend on improved characterization of the molecules driving the pathogenesis of IPF. It is well defined that IPF is characterized by the expression of genes indicating an active tissue remodeling program, including extracellular matrix (ECM) and basement membrane components, as well as myofibroblast-associated and epithelial cell-related genes. A few recent advances are worth mentioning. Pulmonary research demonstrates abnormal expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding proteins (IGFBPs) in IPF, including human IPF bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and BAL fluids, human IPF fibroblasts, as well as fibrotic lung tissues of bleomycin-induced mice and IPF patients, analyzed by microarray, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), ribonuclease protection assay (RPA), Western blot, immunohistochemistry, or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Simultaneously, in vitro and in vivo studies indicate the involvement of IGFBPs in the initiation and development of the fibrosis process, including fibroblast activation and transdifferentiation to a myofibroblast phenotype, epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT), increased ECM production, and decreased ECM degradation, possibly contributing to the final lung fibrosis. These observations suggest that dysregulation of IGFBPs may be a key factor responsible for the initiation and perpetuation of IPF.

Human aortas were obtained from 35 autopsied cases, and each sample was divided into halves. One half was used for the analysis of mRNA or protein expression with RT-PCR or Western blotting, respectively. The other was microscopically classified into atheromatous plaque (AP), fatty streak (FS), and diffuse intimal thickening (DIT), and was analyzed immunohistochemically. The mRNA levels of both PPARs increased significantly in atherosclerosis and tended to increase in proportion to the severity of the lesion, and the expression of PPAR-\u03b1 correlated with that of PPAR-\u03b3 in FS and AP. The PPAR-\u03b3 protein increased in AP. Monocytes/macrophages, as well as endothelial and smooth muscle cells, expressed the PPAR-\u03b3 protein in plaques. This expression in the DIT was noted mainly in macrophages but was not correlated with the density of macrophages, suggesting that only certain macrophages express the PPARs in DIT. Cell proliferation did not correlate with PPARs expression in any lesion type. These findings suggest that PPARs may be associated with atheromatous plaque formation, and that PPAR-\u03b3 may be involved in the early stages of human atherosclerosis.",

The aim of this study was to analyze SEDLBCL cases for their clinical and histopathologic findings, including an association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and immunohistochemical characteristics.We analyzed the clinicopathologic findings of 27 SEDLBCL cases. They consisted of 16 males and 11 females, their age ranging from 37\u201386 years (median 64 years). Eight patients had stage I disease, 3 had stage II, 5 had stage III, and 11 had stage IV. Based on the staining pattern for anti-CD10, bcl-6, and MUM-1, the cases were categorized into 17 cases of the germinal center B-cell (GCB) type and nine of the non-GCB type. There was a 4%-positive rate for EBV in the tumor cells. When compared to nodal DLBCL, the frequency of patients with a high performance status (PS) is higher in SEDLBCL. Compared to the DLBCL of the central nervous system (CNS), the frequency of cases with high stage, 2 or more extranodal lesions, high international prognostic index (IPI), and GCB-type is higher in SEDLBCL. There were no significant differences in the histologic features between SEDLBCL and nodal/CNS DLBCL. Univariate analysis revealed that advanced stage was an unfavorable factor for overall survival (P=0.060).SEDLBCL is different from nodal and CNS DLBCL, but an association with EBV is unlikely in every group.",

The knowledge of effects in lung cancer cells is sparse. Therefore, the effects in primary lung cancer cell lines were investigated.Four primary lung cancer cell lines were incubated for 3, 6, 12, 15, 18, and 24\u00a0h with synthetic partial structures (peptide and glycopeptide). The control substance was sodium butyrate. mRNA was isolated, and relative quantification of E-cadherin was performed using the Real-Time PCR. During the stimulation period, morphologic pictures were taken, and immunohistochemical staining of membranous E-cadherin was performed. Life/dead assays were used to display cell vitality.The intracellular E-cadherin mRNA amount was increased after incubation with the synthetic partial structures. Life/dead assays showed improved survival and integrated cell/cell bindings after stimulation with the partial structures. Increased cell mortality was revealed after sodium butyrate incubation. An effect mediated via E-cadherin on the cellular surface is proposed.The two synthetic partial structures of the homophilic binding region of E-cadherin increased the intracellular E-cadherin mRNA amount, cell\u2013cell bindings, and survival of the tumor cells. Extracellular binding by synthetic partial structures to the binding region may have a beneficial influence on tumor progression in the metastatic process.",

     "abstract": "Sertoli\u2013Leydig cell tumor (SLCT) is a rare tumor involving the ovary. Approximately 20% of SLCT are associated with heterologous elements that are either of endodermal or mesodermal origin. The gastrointestinal-type epithelium is the most commonly described endodermal heterologous element. SLCT with benign and borderline mucinous neoplasm has been reported in the literature. However, SLCT with mucinous adenocarcinoma as heterologous element has been rarely documented. Herein, we describe a rare case of intermediately differentiated Sertoli\u2013Leydig cell tumor with mucinous adenocarcinoma as the heterologous element in a 21-year-old woman. She presented with throbbing lower abdominal pain and was found to have a large, complex left ovarian mass on imaging studies. She underwent left salpingo-oophorectomy, appendectomy and lymph node staging. Gross examination of the surgical specimen showed a large, encapsulated, solid-cystic mass completely replacing the ovary. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of intermediately differentiated Sertoli\u2013Leydig cell tumor and well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. Interestingly, the bulk of the tumor (more than 90%) was composed of mucinous adenocarcinoma, whereas the SLCT component comprised less than 10% of the total tumor. The mucinous adenocarcinoma expressed positivity for CK20, CEA, CDX2 and CK7, and the SLCT component was positive for inhibin expression. The histopathological features and results of immunostaining were consistent with the diagnosis of the intermediately differentiated SLCT with mucinous adenocarcinoma as the heterologous element. This case was a diagnostic challenge as more than 90% of the tumor was composed of mucinous adenocarcinoma and SLCT constituted only the minor part of the tumor. This feature was in contrast to the previously described two cases, where mucinous adenocarcinoma as heterologous element was present as microscopic foci. This case highlights the importance of identifying the SLCT component in a case of an apparently pure mucinous adenocarcinoma in a young patient.",

She first presented with severe headaches, and was seen by imaging to harbor a moderately enhancing mass 2.5\u00a0cm in diameter at the rostral septum pellucidum accompanied by occlusive hydrocephalus. Microscopically, the tumor consisted of solid, wavy fascicles of elongated cells that were occasionally interrupted by vague perivascular pseudorosettes. Mitotic activity was absent, and less than 1% of nuclei immunoreacted for MIB-1. A histological diagnosis of tanycytic ependymoma (WHO grade II) was rendered, and no adjuvant therapy given. At recurrence, the lesion was 3.5\u00a0cm in diameter, intensely enhancing, and had already seeded into the subarachnoid space. Histology showed a biphasic glial\u2013sarcomatous architecture with remnants of the original ependymoma now displaying hypercellularity and atypical \u2013 yet not frankly anaplastic \u2013 features. The sarcomatous moiety consisted of spindle and epithelioid cells densely interwoven with reticulin fibers.

A focal hemangiopericytoma-like growth pattern with alternating hypercellular and hypocellular areas, as well as the deposition of dense keloid-type collagen, raising the suspicion of SFT, could be identified only after a careful examination of the whole tumor. Immunohistochemistry was helpful in confirming the diagnosis of SFT, revealing a diffuse staining of neoplastic cells for vimentin, CD34, bcl-2 protein, and, focally, CD99. Myogenic markers (\u03b1-smooth muscle actin, desmin, h-caldesmon) were not expressed.The pathologist should be aware of this variant of intraoral leiomyomatous-like SFT to avoid a misdiagnosis of leiomyoma.

The channels were lined with flattened endothelium, which was immunohistochemically positive for D2-40. In addition, lymphangiectasis was found around the thymus and intra-abdominal organs, but no cardiovascular anomalies were seen. The findings conformed to a primary form of CPL, Noonan Group 3. Although pulmonary interstitial emphysema (PIE) was considered an important differential diagnosis because of the overlapping clinicopathologic features, a giant cell reaction surrounding the interstitial cystic lesions, a histologic hallmark of PIE, was absent in the present case.",

For this purpose, we have determined anti-oxidant activities of both compounds at a range of various pH (7.4\u20135.4) values. Low pH increased the rate of lipid peroxidation in the absence of Fe+2 (20\u00a0\u03bcmol) in liver homogenates. This higher extent of lipid peroxidation can be explained by the mobilized iron, which may come from reserves where it is weakly bound. The addition of iron (Fe) chelator desferoxamine (DFO, 1\u00a0mmol) to reaction medium completely inhibited the peroxidation processes at all studied pH values. Diphenyl diselenide (0\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcmol) significantly protected lipid peroxidation at all studied pH values, while ebselen (0\u2013100\u00a0\u03bcmol) did not offer any protection. The differences in activities of diphenyl diselenide and ebselen have been explained with reference to the active selenol formation using their catalytic reactions. The anti-oxidant potential of diphenyl diselenide is confirmed against acidosis-catalyzed oxidative stress in rat liver homogenates.",

We report here three cases of IM lymphadenitis with histologic findings indistinguishable from those of toxoplasmic lymphadenitis. The histologic findings of the three cases presented here showed a histologic triad of toxoplasmic lymphadenitis, including (i) numerous lymphoid follicles with hyperplastic germinal centers; (ii) small clusters or single epithelioid histiocytes; and (iii) multiple foci of monocytoid B-cells. Moreover, all three lesions contained isolated or small clusters of epithelioid histiocytes within the hyperplastic germinal centers and the periphery of lymphoid follicles, which are the most specific histologic findings of toxoplasmic lymphadenitis. However, serologic findings confirmed EBV infection in all three cases. On in situ hybridization, numerous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded small RNA (EBER)-positive cells were demonstrated in the germinal center, as well as in interfolicular areas in all three cases. Toxoplasmosis gondii infection was excluded in at least one case, based on serologic findings. Polymerase chain reaction analysis also demonstrated that there was no T. gondii DNA in the remaining two cases. Two of our three cases showed atypical clinical presentations, including an absence of atypical lymphocytosis in peripheral blood in two cases, age more than 30 years, and an absence of systemic symptoms in one case. It appears that previous descriptions emphasize the differential diagnostic problems between IM lymphadenitis and malignant lymphomas. However, from a therapeutic perspective, it is important to discriminate IM lymphadenitis from toxoplasmic lymphadenitis particularly in patients showing atypical clinical features.",

No other tumors were found in the body by imaging modalities. Cystectomy and left nephroureterectomy were performed. The bladder tumor was a large polypoid tumor consisting of pleomorphic sarcomatoid carcinoma (80%) and high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma (20%), both invading the deep muscle layer. There were gradual merges between the two. The sarcomatous component was composed of malignant spindle, polygonal, and giant cells. Lymphovascular permeation was pronounced. Immunohistochemically, the sarcomatous element was positive for vimentin and various types of cytokeratins (CK), while the urothelial carcinoma element was positive for various types of CK and negative for vimentin. The ureter tumor was small and obstructed the ureter lumen. It was a pure squamous cell carcinoma without a urothelial component. The ureter tumor invaded the adventitia. A mild degree of lymphovascular invasion was recognized. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for various types of CK but negative for vimentin. In the kidney, almost the entire kidney parenchyma was replaced by a tumor. The renal pelvis was broadly erosive but was free of apparent tumors.

The aneurysmal wall was composed primarily of \u03b1SMA-positive and calponin/desmin-negative spindle cells and lacked internal elastic lamina, which was completely disrupted at the neck of the aneurysm. There was a strong positive immunoreactivity for matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 1, 2, and 9 in the spindle cells of the aneurysmal wall. In contrast, tests for MMP-8 were negative. The parent artery showed thickening of both the intima and media, with preservation of the internal elastic lamina. Atherosclerosis was not detected in either the parent artery or aneurysm.

Pleural localization is very exceptional, and only 48 cases have been reported in the English literature to date.

The mean age at diagnosis was 58 years, and the male to female ratio was 6:1. The overall prognosis was poor, and most of the patients died of disease soon after diagnosis. Histological features and clinical presentation often cause several problems in the differential diagnosis, particularly with mesothelioma and metastasis from poorly differentiated carcinomas.

GLTSCR2 regulates the stability of PTEN, and is therefore believed to have a tumor suppressive function. In a recent study, we demonstrated that GLTSCR2 often exhibits genetic alterations and down-regulation in glioblastoma specimens. However, GLTSCR2 expression levels in human tumors and its mechanism of tumor suppression remain largely unknown. We performed an immunohistochemical examination of GLTSCR2 expression in samples of seborrheic keratosis (SK, n=69), a common benign skin tumor, and normal skin (n=23), and assessed the relationship between GLTSCR2 expression and the patients' clinicopathologic factors. Our results showed that GLTSCR2 expression in SK was significantly lower than in normal skin (p<0.001), and this decreased expression of GLTSCR2 was associated with patient age (p=0.045). Using in situ hybridization analysis, we found that mRNA expression of GLTSCR2 was reduced in tumor cells compared to normal skin. This is the first study analyzing the expression of GLTSCR2, a putative tumor suppressor, in SK and normal skin. Our results show a down-regulation of this protein in SK, indicating that GLTSCR2 may have a protective effect on the development of SK.",

We investigated the relationship between the expression of these antigens and age, gender, tumor size, histologic patterns and necrosis, as well as tumor behavior.The risk of malignancy was higher when tumor size was increased. We found out that more uncommon tissue patterns, such as small cell and spindle cell patterns, are mostly indicators of malignancy.

Control liver specimens were from two patients with choledochal cysts, three patients with neonatal hepatitis, and three patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. We also studied the expression of CAP37, an antimicrobial protein present in neutrophils, using immunohistochemistry in biopsy and hilar sections. Neutrophils were present in the portal tracts in all cases and widely distributed in the parenchyma in nine cases. In six cases, infiltration of neutrophils was associated with discrete foci of liver cell necrosis. There was a significantly higher number of portal tract neutrophils in biliary atresia and choledochal cyst cases than in neonatal hepatitis and alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (p<0.05). All neutrophils stained diffusely and strongly with CAP37. Medium staining was also seen in the proliferating portal bile ductules in six cases.

     "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the morphological characteristics of the esophageal epithelium (EE) and its local immunity. Esophageal fragments of autopsied women were collected from 1980 to 2008, and two groups were analyzed: with AIDS (n=17) and without AIDS (n=12). The measurement of the esophageal epithelium was carried out through the image analysis software ImageJ, and the immunostaining of Langerhans cells (LCs) was carried out using anti-S100 antibody. Women with AIDS, when compared with women without AIDS, had significantly thinner EE (220.6 versus 243.5\u00a0\u03bcm), a less number of LCs (6.2 versus 18.8\u00a0LCs/mm2), and a higher percentage of immature or morphologically altered LCs (66.6 versus 40.0%). The malnourished women, when compared with normonourished women, regardless of AIDS, had significantly thinner EE (227.1 versus 238.0\u00a0\u03bcm) and a less number of LCs (6.2 versus 12.5\u00a0LCs/mm2). The percentage of immature or morphologically altered LCs was the same in both groups. Additionally, the women with AIDS (7.0 versus 2.8%) and the malnourished women (5.8 versus 3.1%) presented a significantly higher percentage of fibrosis. We concluded that AIDS and malnutrition contribute to the decrease in esophagus local immunity and, therefore, to a possible increase in local opportunistic infections.",

The clinical presentation, the immunophenotype, and the genotype, especially of the malignant squamous component with partial expression of TTF1, marked expression of p63 and mutation of BRAF, were consistent with the diagnosis of a papillary thyroid carcinoma with squamous component.

     "abstract": "ARDS pathophysiology is characterized by complex mechanisms that involve cells of inflammation, lung tissue cells, cytokines, chemokines, as well as apoptosis activators and inhibitors. There are two important theories that link apoptosis with ARDS and suggest that epithelial cell apoptosis, as well as the accumulation of neutrophils in the lung, may contribute to a cascade of events and, finally, ARDS. The activation of the Fas/FasL pathway is an important mechanism of alveolar epithelial injury in the lungs of patients with ALI. In addition, neutrophilic inflammation in the alveolar spaces is characteristic of ALI in humans and in most animal models of ALI. The enhanced phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils could lead to resolution of inflammation and repair during ARDS. In this review, we will focus on elucidating the role of apoptosis in the pathophysiology of ARDS and the contribution of Fas-mediated inflammation in ARDS. Furthermore, we will give evidence that TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-13 attenuate the pro-cell death effects of Fas/CD95 on A549 epithelial cells, at least partially, by the NF-kB and PI3-K pathways, suggesting that induction of the expression of antiapoptotic genes protects the epithelial cells from cell death.",

The sPLA2 inhibitor was administered by intravenous injection 30\u00a0min before induction of pancreatitis. The severity of pancreatitis was evaluated by serum amylase and pancreatic histological score. The serum corticosterone level was measured. Adrenal injury was evaluated by histological evaluation, as well as by sPLA2 activity and sPLA2-IIA protein analysis.Pancreatitis resulted in a time-related increase in serum amylase and in the pancreatic histological score. At first, serum corticosterone increased after 3\u00a0h and decreased rapidly after 6\u00a0h in pancreatitis. Adrenal injury aggravated during the observation period. The sPLA2 activity in the serum and adrenal glands, as well as the expression of sPLA2-IIA protein in adrenal glands increased and peaked 6\u00a0h after the induction of pancreatitis. Pretreatment of sPLA2 inhibitor significantly reduced the severity of pancreatitis and adrenal histological injury, improved the 24-h serum corticosterone levels, and effectively inhibited sPLA2 activity and sPLA2-IIA expression in adrenal glands.The sPLA2 inhibitor attenuated the severity of pancreatitis and pancreatitis-associated adrenal injury.

To investigate the presence or absence of monoclonal B-cell proliferation, we analyzed the immunohistological and genotypic findings in three cases of pulmonary PCGs. Histologically, the three lesions were characterized by severe infiltration of mature plasma cells, plasmacytoid cells, and small lymphocytes intermixed. Scattered Russell bodies (intracytoplasmic inclusions) were present in all three cases, but there were no Dutcher bodies (intranuclear inclusions) or centrocyte-like cells. Immunohistochemical studies of light chain determinants demonstrated the polytypic nature of B-cells. There was no CD5+, CD43+ or cyclin D1+ B-lymphocytes in any of the three lesions. There were no lymphoepithelial lesions detected within any of the three lesions even by immunostaining for cytokeratin. However, polymerase chain assay for immunoglobulin heavy chain gene demonstrated a clonal band in one of the three cases. It currently remains unclear whether this one case, demonstrating IgH gene rearrangement in our series, could be a sign of the prelymphomatous stage (e.g. incipient MALT type lymphoma) or merely represents an exaggeration of normal B-cell clonal response.",

Cox proportional hazard regression model, Fisher's exact test, and multivariate general linear model (GLM) were used to uncover the effects of the variables, such as nodal status, distant metastasis, angiogenic patterns, and MVD, on survival.There was an association between only one of the microvascular patterns and aggressive clinical course. Increased blood-filled capillaries with some clustering in the tumor might be a predictor of aggressive biological behavior in invasive breast carcinomas. Similar studies investigating larger series are needed before a generalized conclusion can be made.",

     "abstract": "Fatty acid binding protein-7 (FABP-7) is normally expressed in the mammary gland. The aim of this study was to clarify the phenotype of breast cancers with respect to the overexpression of FABP-7. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was carried out on 16 cases, including 4 ER(+)/HER2(\u2212), 2 ER(+)/HER2(+), 3 ER(\u2212)/HER2(+), and 5 ER(\u2212)/HER2(\u2212) samples, and 2 non-neoplastic mammary glands as control tissue. Breast cancers categorized as ER(\u2212)/HER2(\u2212) revealed a high cDNA level of FABP-7 as compared to other groups of breast cancer (p=0.004). An immunohistochemical study carried out on 88 cases showed that FABP-7 overexpression had a strong relationship with triple-negative cases (45.8%, p=0.001) and the basal-like subtype (37.5%, p=0.001). Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PgR) expressions had reverse correlation with FABP-7 overexpression (p=0.003, p<0.0001), but no significant associations can be identified between human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and FABP-7 (p=0.219). In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate overexpression of FABP-7 in triple-negative breast cancers [ER(\u2212), PgR(\u2212)/HER2(\u2212)], especially in basal-like breast cancer, and to give a probable interpretation of the high histological grade and poor prognosis of basal-like breast cancer.",

The cancer cells were round-to-polygonal, and scattered bizarre pleomorphic cells with prominent nucleoli were common. The overall appearance of the neoplasm was highly similar in every specimen. The immunohistochemical phenotype of the malignant cells indicated rhabdoid characteristics. A thorough search of the literature revealed additional 22 cases of primary rhabdoid GI cancers.

Notably, long tree-like tumor shadows reminiscent of the structure of the bronchial tree were observed in the bilateral lungs on computed tomography scan, and postmortem analysis clearly revealed metastatic HCC growing and spreading extensively in the lumina of the bronchi. This growth pattern is in sharp contrast to the ordinary endobronchial metastasis, which involves a relatively short segment of the unilateral bronchus. This is the first case report of bilateral and extensive spreading of endobronchial metastatic HCC, and this phenomenon should be considered as a cause of dyspnea in advanced HCC patients.",

Eleven cases (11% of 103 discordant cases) with HER2-amplification were positive for antibody A0485 and false negative for HercepTest.

In 50 patients with gastro-esophageal reflux disease receiving proton pump inhibitor (PPI) with such tongues of columnar epithelium, we noted that under this treatment, PPI-typical hypertrophy of the parietal cells in the corpus can be found, but not in the corpus or cardia/corpus transitional mucosa in biopsy material obtained from tongues of columnar epithelium in the distal esophagus.These observations may by an indication that in short segments of columnar epithelium corpus, mucosa with no PPI-induced hyperplasia of the parietal cells may be interpreted as metaplastic mucosa.",

     "abstract": "Infantile hepatic hamangioendothelioma type II is similar to angiosarcoma in terms of histomorphology and behavior. Various presentations of this lesion have been reported in the literature, e.g. cases with a hepatic mass, cutaneous hemangiomas, heart failure, etc. We report on a patient, male/2 years, who had two jejunal masses and a hepatic mass accompanied by lower GI bleeding and intestinal obstruction. The two jejunal masses and the hepatic lesion were diagnosed as angiosarcoma histomorphologically (IHHE type II), and were positive for vascular markers (CD31 and CD34) on immunohistochemistry. The patient had no skin lesions. We report this case and provide a literature review because of the unusual presentation and the overall rarity of this entity.",

     "abstract": "Reports about adrenocortical carcinomas (AC) mixed with sarcomatous areas are very rare. The terminology and pathogenesis of such biphasic tumors remain controversial. Herein, we report a case of sarcomatoid carcinoma of the adrenal gland in a 75-year-old woman who presented with left abdominal pain of one month's standing. The results of abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT) showed the presence of a large heterogeneous adrenal mass. A left adrenalectomy and complete splenectomy were performed. Histologically, the neoplasm showed areas of adrenocortical carcinoma and areas of sarcomatoid spindle cell proliferation. When examined immunohistochemically, the carcinomatous cells stained positively for S-100 protein, Melan-A protein, and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and focally for vimentin and the cytokeratin marker MNF 116. Also, the carcinomatous cells were immunoreactive to the monoclonal antibody HMB-45. The sarcomatous component expressed vimentin, as well as other smooth and skeletal muscle markers. Liver metastases appeared 3 months postoperatively. Twelve months after removal of the primary tumor, the patient died of her disease. To the best of our knowledge, only seven cases of adrenal sarcomatoid carcinoma have been reported in the medical literature. We review the reported cases according to the 2004 classification of the World Health Organization (WHO) of lung tumors, and highlight the histogenesis, diagnosis, and clinical course of this very aggressive tumor.",

     "abstract": "Salivary gland oncocytic lipoadenoma is an exceptional benign tumor composed of mature adipose tissue associated with a mixture of oncocytes. We report a case of oncocytic lipoadenoma showing sebaceous differentiation, and provide a cytogenetic analysis, which has not yet been described. A 64-year-old male developed a left parotid gland, well-encapsulated tumor measuring 3.5\u00d73\u00a0cm2, showing mature fat cells associated with oncocytic changes of epithelial components. Immunohistochemistry showed a dual epithelial population with ductal (positivity for AE1/AE3, CK19, CK7 antibodies) and basal-cell (positivity for p63, CK14, CK5,6 antibodies) differentiation in oncocytic areas. Moreover, oncocytic cells were stained with anti-alpha-1 antichymotrypsin antibody and phosphotungstic acid\u2013hematoxylin staining. Molecular cytogenetic analysis showed a translocation t(12;14), resulting in structural rearrangement of the region framing the HMGA2 gene at 12q14.3. Such alterations in HMGA2 have been described in both lipomas and pleomorphic adenomas of the salivary glands.",
