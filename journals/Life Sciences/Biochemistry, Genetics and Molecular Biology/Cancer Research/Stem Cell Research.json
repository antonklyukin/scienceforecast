     "abstract": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/RI), produced by an initial interruption of organ blood flow and its subsequent restoration, contributes significantly to the pathophysiologies of stroke, myocardial infarction, renal I/RI, intestinal I/RI and liver I/RI, which are major causes of disability (including transplant failure) and even mortality. While the restoration of blood flow is required to restore oxygen and nutrient requirements, reperfusion often triggers local and systemic inflammatory responses and subsequently elevate the ischemic insult where the duration of ischemia determines the magnitude of I/RI damage. I/RI increases vascular leakage, changes transcriptional and cell death programs, drives leukocyte entrapment and inflammation and oxidative stress in tissues. Therapeutic approaches which reduce complications associated with I/RI are desperately needed to address the clinical and economic burden created by I/RI. Stem cells (SC) represent ubiquitous and uncommitted cell populations with the ability to self-renew and differentiate into one or more developmental \u2018fates\u2019. Like immune cells, stem cells can home to and penetrate I/R-injured tissues, where they can differentiate into target tissues and induce trophic paracrine signaling which suppress injury and maintain tissue functions perturbed by ischemia-reperfusion. This review article summarizes the present use and possible protective mechanisms underlying stem cell protection in diverse forms of ischemia-reperfusion.",

Growing emphasis on the importance of rigor and reproducibility in lab-based science requires development of best practices approaches, including quality control procedures for the assessment of CM batches to ensure reliable interpretation and reproducibility. Here, we tested activity level variations of L-WRN CM, which is produced from an L cell line engineered to secrete W nt3a, R spondin 3, and N oggin into a single CM that is widely used for gastrointestinal stem cell culture. We assessed 14 independent batches of L-WRN CM, produced by 5 laboratories at 3 research institutions, by multiple quantitative assays. We observed highly replicable activity levels among L-WRN CM batches prepared according to a previously published protocol. Quality control assays measuring spheroid growth or mRNA gene marker expression were best able to distinguish the quality L-WRN CM batches, whereas a Wnt reporter assay did not. Thus, we have validated that L-WRN CM activity is highly reproducible over time and between laboratories and have provided guidelines for L-WRN CM quality control testing. These validation procedures and guidelines will benefit experiment replication efforts in stem cell research.",

Increasingly, laboratories are creating their own banks of iPSCs derived from diverse donors.

Here, we report the establishment of a panel of 30 iPSCs from CD34+ peripheral blood mononuclear cells, of which 10 were further differentiated in vitro into all three germ layers. We characterized these different cell types with commonly used pluripotent and lineage specific markers, and showed that NES, TUBB3, and OTX2 cannot be reliably used as ectoderm differentiation markers. Our work highlights the importance of marker selection in iPSC authentication, and the need for the field to establish definitive standard assays.",

     "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess endogenous reparative properties and may serve as an exogenous therapeutic intervention in patients with chronic kidney disease. Cardiovascular risk factors clustering in the metabolic syndrome (MetS) might adversely affect cellular properties. To test the hypothesis that Mets interferes with MSC characteristics, we performed comprehensive comparison of the mRNA, microRNA, and protein content of MSCs isolated from Lean and MetS pigs.Domestic pigs were fed a 16-week Lean or MetS diet (n\u202f=\u202f4 each). Expression profiles of co-existing microRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins were obtained by high-throughput sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. TargetScan and ComiR were used to predict target genes of differentially expressed microRNAs, and DAVID 6.7 for functional annotation analysis to rank primary gene ontology categories for the microRNA target genes, mRNAs, and proteins.Differential expression analysis revealed 12 microRNAs upregulated in MetS-MSCs compared to Lean-MSCs (fold change>1.4, p\u202f<\u202f.05), which target 7728 genes, whereas 33 mRNAs and 78 proteins were downregulated (fold change<0.7, p\u202f<\u202f.05). Integrated analysis showed that targets of those microRNAs upregulated in MetS-MSCs overlap with at least half of mRNAs and proteins dysregulated in those cells. Functional analysis of overlapping mRNAs and proteins suggest that they are primarily involved in mitochondria, inflammation and transcription. MetS-MSCs also exhibited increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor kappa-B, associated with increased SA-\u03b2-Galactosidase and decreased cytochrome-c oxidase-IV activity.MetS alters the transcriptome and proteome of swine adipose tissue-derived MSCs particularly genes involved in mitochondria, inflammation and transcription regulation. These alterations might limit the reparative function of endogenous MSC and their use as an exogenous regenerative therapy.",

Rat ASCs were cultured in osteogenic medium for 72\u202fh and assigned into three sets, namely ERK1/2 inhibitor treated set, p38 inhibitor treated set, and the control set. After inhibitor treatment, all cells were subjected to cyclic stretch(2000 \u03bc\u03b5, 1\u202fHz) on a four-point bending mechanical loading device. Protein and mRNA samples were acquired at six time points: 0, 15\u202fmin, 30\u202fmin, 1\u202fh, 2\u202fh and 6\u202fh. Western blot showed phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 was elevated by cyclic tensile stress at all time points, while p38 at 15\u202fmin, 30\u202fmin and 1\u202fh, and the elevation can be completely blocked by corresponding inhibitors. The treatment by ERK1/2 inhibitor was shown to antagonize the up-regulation of osteogenic genes bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) by mechanical stretch at 15\u202fmin and 6\u202fh, whereas p38 inhibitor took effect at 15\u202fmin only. The results suggested both ERK and p38 could be positive mediators of stretch-induced osteogenic differentiation of ASCs, and ERK stimulate the stretch-induced osteogenic differentiation at both early and late stages while p38 responds to mechanical stretch in a more rapid fashion.",

However, with conventional ex vivo techniques, such as histology, the individual timeline of differentiation is not accessible. Therefore, we designed lentiviral plasmids with cell-specific promoters to control the expression of bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging reporters. Promoter-dependent reporter expression in transduced human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) was an effective indicator of differentiation in cell culture. A 12-week in vivo imaging observation period revealed the time profile of differentiation of engrafted hNPCs in the mouse brain into astrocytes and mature neurons which was verified by immunostainings, patch-clamp electrophysiology, and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy. The lentiviral vectors validated in this study provide an efficient imaging toolbox for non-invasive and longitudinal characterization of stem cell differentiation, in vitro screenings, and in vivo studies of cell therapy in animal models.",

     "publication date": "03-2019",
     "abstract": "The molecular mechanisms involved in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generation are poorly understood. The cell death machinery of apoptosis-inducing caspases have been shown to facilitate the process of iPSCs reprogramming. However, the effect of other cell death processes, such as programmed necrosis (necroptosis), on iPSCs induction has not been studied. In this study, we investigated the role of receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIP3), an essential regulator of necroptosis, in reprogramming mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs) into iPSCs. RIP3 was found to be upregulated in iPSCs compared to MEFs. Deletion of RIP3 dramatically suppressed the reprogramming of iPSCs (~82%). RNA-seq analysis and qRT-PCR showed that RIP3 KO MEFs expressed lower levels of genes that control cell cycle progression and cell division and higher levels of extracellular matrix-regulating genes. The growth rate of RIP3 KO MEFs was significantly slower than WT MEFs. These findings can partially explain the inhibitory effects of RIP3 deletion on iPSCs generation and show for the first time that the necroptosis kinase RIP3 plays an important role in iPSC reprogramming. In contrast to RIP3, the kinase and scaffolding functions of RIPK1 appeared to have distinct effects on reprogramming.",

However, because of a lack of specific marker genes, methods for the stepwise differentiation and isolation of human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cholangiocyte progenitors at ductal plate stages have not been established. We herein generated an AQP1-GFP reporter hiPSC line and developed a combination treatment with transforming growth factor (TGF) \u03b22 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) to induce hiPSC-derived hepatoblasts into AQP1+ cells in vitro. By confirming that the isolated AQP1+ cells showed similar gene expression patterns to cholangiocyte progenitors at the remodeling ductal plate stage around gestational week (GW) 20, we established a differentiation protocol from hiPSCs through SOX9+CK19+AQP1\u2212 ductal plate-like cells into SOX9+CK19+AQP1+ remodeling ductal plate-like cells. We further generated 3D bile duct-like structures from the induced ductal plate-like cells. These results suggest that AQP1 is a useful marker for the generation of remodeling ductal plate cells from hiPSCs. Our methods may contribute to elucidating the differentiation mechanisms of ductal plate cells and the pathogenesis of ductal plate malformation.",

Overactive Notch2 signalling has been associated with poor prognosis of aggressive brain tumours, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We recently reported that constitutive expression of the Notch2 intracellular domain (N2ICD) enhances proliferation and gliogenesis in NSCs. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which Notch2 promotes resistance to apoptosis of NSCs to cytotoxic insults. We performed ex vivo studies using NSC cultures from transgenic mice constitutively expressing N2ICD. These NSCs expressed increased levels of pro-survival factors and lack an apoptotic response to the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide, not showing neither mitochondrial damage nor caspase activation. Interestingly, Notch2 signalling also regulated chemoresistance of human GBM cells to etoposide. We also identified a signalling crosstalk with FGF signalling pathway involved in this resistance to apoptosis of NSCs. Aberrant Notch2 expression enhances fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) activity to specifically target the AKT-GSK3 signalling pathway to block apoptosis. These results have implications for understanding molecular changes involved in both tumorigenesis and therapy resistance.",

Here we describe the methodology for analysis of epithelial barrier function and molecular regulation in intestinal organoids. Barrier responses to interferon-\u03b3 of intestinal organoids with and without epithelial cell-specific deletion of the interferon-\u03b3-receptor 2 gene were used as a model system. The established method allowed monitoring of the kinetics of interferon-\u03b3-induced permeability changes in living organoids.

We show in human embryonic stem cells (hESC) that an ambient oxygen-induced oxidative stress response elicited by culture in a hypoxic atmosphere (0.5% O2) correlates with the expression of 2OG dioxygenases, which oxidise DNA (TET1, 2, 3) and histone H3 (KDM4C), the former reflected by elevation in genomic 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). siRNA-mediated targeting of KDM4C and TET1\u20133 induces hESC differentiation. Under ambient atmospheric oxygen (21% O2), exposure to a low inhibitory concentration of sodium arsenite (NaAsO2, IC10), as a model of chemically-induced oxidative stress, suppresses antioxidant gene expression, reduces mitochondrial membrane potential and induces hESC differentiation. Co-administration of the antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine promoted anti-oxidant, pluripotency and 2OG dioxygenase gene expression, elevated genomic hydroxymethylation and blocked induction of differentiation. Transient ectopic expression of KDM4C or TET1 in ambient atmospheric oxygen achieved the same.

Here, we have specifically depleted A20 in multi-potent progenitors (MPPs) and studied its impact on hematopoiesis. Our data suggest that lack of A20 in Flt3+ progenitors causes modest alterations in hematopoietic differentiation. Analysis of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) pool revealed alterations in HSPC subsets including, HSCs, MPP1, MPP2, MPP3 and MPP4. Interestingly, A20 deficiency in MPPs caused loss of HSC quiescence and compromised long-term hematopoietic reconstitution. Mechanistic studies identified that A20 deficiency caused elevated levels of Interferon-\u03b3 signaling and downregulation of p57 in HSCs. In essence, these studies identified A20 as a key regulator of HSC quiescence and cell fate decisions.",

Their stem cell function was examined using the in vitro organoid/colony forming efficiency (CFE) assay. Aging reduced the number of tracheal basal and alveolar type-2 (AT2) cells. HFD significantly increased the number of AT2 cells. Aging also caused a significant increase in lung inflammation, and HFD caused a similar increase, in young mice. Aging reduced mitochondrial mass and function, and increased reactive oxygen species. In young mice, HFD caused mitochondrial changes similar to the aging-induced changes. Organoid culture of tracheal and lung epithelial cells collected from both young and old HFD-fed mice showed higher CFE compared to SD-fed mice. Switching the HFD to low calorie/fat diet (LCD) efficiently reversed several of the HFD-induced effects.

We then derived a mesenchymal progenitor cell (NCC-MPCs) population with chondrogenic and osteogenic potential from cranial NCCs and investigated their similarity to widely studied human postnatal dental or periodontal stem/progenitor cells. NCC-MPCs were quite distinct from both their precursor cells (NCCs) and bone-marrow mesenchymal stromal cells, a stromal population of mesodermal origin. Despite their similarity with dental stem/progenitor cells, NCC-MPCs were clearly differentiated by a core set of 43 genes, including ACKR3 (CXCR7), whose expression (both at transcript and protein level) appear to be specific to NCC-MPCs.Altogether, our data demonstrate the feasibility of craniofacial mesenchymal progenitor derivation from human iPSCs through a neural crest-intermediate and set the foundation for future studies regarding their full differentiation repertoire and their in vivo existence.",

Ectopic SOX4 expression has also been shown to inhibit oligodendrocyte differentiation in mice, however the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that SOX4 regulates transcriptional targets associated with neural development in neural stem cells (NSCs), reducing the expression of genes promoting oligodendrocyte differentiation. Interestingly, we observe that SOX4 levels decreased during oligodendrocyte differentiation in vitro. Moreover, we show that SOX4 knockdown induces increased oligodendrocyte differentiation, as the percentage of Olig2-positive/2\u2032,3\u2019-Cyclic-nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase)-positive maturing oligodendrocytes increases, while the number of Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte precursors is unaffected. Conversely, conditional SOX4 overexpression utilizing a doxycycline inducible system decreases the percentage of maturing oligodendrocytes, suggesting that SOX4 inhibits maturation from precursor to mature oligodendrocyte. We identify the transcription factor Hes5 as a direct SOX4 target gene and we show that conditional overexpression of Hes5 rescues the increased oligodendrocyte differentiation mediated by SOX4 depletion in NSCs. Taken together, these observations support a novel role for SOX4 in NSC by controlling oligodendrocyte differentiation through induction of Hes5 expression.",

Furthermore, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to verify the stereotypical organization of the graft showing that it mimics the host spinal cord. Within the graft white matter (WM) we identified astrocytes that form glial limitans, myelinating oligodendrocytes, and myelinated axons with paranodes.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of ESC-derived complex vasculature that includes the presence of blood brain barrier. In addition to the formation of mature spinal cord tissue, we describe factors that drive this process. Specifically, we identify Flk1+ cells as necessary for spinal cord formation, and synaptic connectivity with the host spinal cord and formation of host-graft chimeric vasculature as contributing factors.

Here we demonstrate that WDR68 is not only an integral component of the PRC1-AUTS2 complex, but it is also required for PRC1-AUTS2-mediated transcription activation. Furthermore, deletion of Wdr68 in mouse embryonic stem cells leads to defects in neuronal differentiation without affecting self-renewal. Through transcriptomic analysis, we found that many genes responsible for neuronal differentiation are down-regulated in Wdr68 deficient neural progenitors. These genes include those targeted by the PRC1-AUTS2 complex. In summary, our studies uncovered a previously unknown but essential component of the active PRC1 complex and evidence of its role in regulating the expression of genes that are important for neuronal differentiation.",

In freshly plated hESC, dynamic and apoptotic blebbing differed in time of occurrence, bleb retraction rate, mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase 3&7 activation. While dynamic blebbing can be controlled with drugs that inhibit myosin II, these methods have off-target effects and are not suitable for clinical applications. Recombinant human laminin-521 or addition of laminin-111 to Matrigel provided a safe method to drastically decrease dynamic blebbing and improve cell attachment with proteins normally found in the inner cell mass. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase, which is activated by binding of integrins to laminin, prolonged dynamic blebbing and inhibited attachment. These data show that hESC bind rapidly to laminins through an integrin, which activates focal adhesion kinase that in turn downregulates dynamic blebbing. Laminins enabled hESC to rapidly attach during passaging, improved plating efficiency, enabled passaging of single pluripotent stem cells, and avoided use of inhibitors that have non-specific off-target effects. These data provide a strategy for improving hESC culture using biologically safe recombinant human proteins.",

Mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) grown in a defined serum-free medium with two kinase inhibitors (\u201c2i ESCs\u201d) have been postulated to reflect ground-state pluripotency, whereas ESCs grown in the presence of serum (\u201cserum ESCs\u201d) share more similarities with post-implantation epiblast cells. Pluripotency results from an intricate interplay between cytoplasmic, nuclear and chromatin-associated proteins. Here, we perform quantitative subcellular proteomics to gain insight in the molecular mechanisms sustaining the pluripotent states reflected by 2i and serum ESCs. We describe a full SILAC workflow and quality controls for proteomic comparison of 2i and serum ESCs, allowing subcellular proteomics of the cytoplasm, nucleoplasm and chromatin. The obtained quantitative information revealed increased levels of na\u00efve pluripotency factors on the chromatin of 2i ESCs. Surprisingly, the cytoplasmic proteome suggests that 2i and serum ESCs utilize distinct metabolic programs, which include upregulation of free radical buffering by the glutathione pathway in 2i ESCs. Through induction of intracellular radicals, we show that the altered metabolic environment renders 2i ESCs less sensitive to oxidative stress. Altogether, this work provides novel insights into the proteomic landscape underlying ground state pluripotency.",

We have shown previously that FAPs are derived from cells that express the transcription factor Osr1 during development. Here we show that adult FAPs express Osr1 at low levels and frequency, however upon acute injury FAPs reactivate Osr1 expression in the injured tissue. Osr1+ FAPs are enriched in proliferating and apoptotic cells demonstrating that Osr1 identifies activated FAPs. In vivo genetic lineage tracing shows that Osr1+ activated FAPs return to the resident FAP pool after regeneration as well as contribute to adipocytes after glycerol-induced fatty degeneration.

Directed differentiation towards mesendodermal lineages is a complex process, involving transition through a primitive streak (PS)-like stage. We have recently shown PS-like patterning from hPSCs into definitive endoderm, cardiac as well as presomitic mesoderm by only modulating the bulk cell density and the concentration of the GSK3 inhibitor CHIR99021, a potent activator of the WNT pathway. The patterning process is modulated by a complex paracrine network, whose identity and mechanistic consequences are poorly understood.To study the underlying dynamics, we here applied mathematical modeling based on ordinary differential equations. We compared time-course data of early hPSC differentiation to increasingly complex model structures with incremental numbers of paracrine factors. Model simulations suggest at least three paracrine factors being required to recapitulate the experimentally observed differentiation kinetics. Feedback mechanisms from both undifferentiated and differentiated cells turned out to be crucial. Evidence from double knock-down experiments and secreted protein enrichment allowed us to hypothesize on the identity of two of the three predicted factors. From a practical perspective, the mathematical model predicts optimal settings for directing lineage-specific differentiation. This opens new avenues for rational stem cell bioprocessing in more advanced culture systems, e.g. in perfusion-fed bioreactors enabling cell therapies.",

Differences between NP populations included differential expression of regional identity markers HOXB4, LBX1, OTX1 and GSX2, which persisted into mature neural cell stages.

It is unclear when and how the ability to maintain pluripotency is acquired during the derivation of ESCs. We analyzed the required culture condition for the maintenance and establishment of ESCs in detail. Even at low concentration of the GSK3\u03b2 inhibitor and LIF (LowGiL), the expression levels of pluripotency markers and the chimera-producing ability of the cells were comparable with those of ESCs cultured in the presence of both inhibitors and LIF (2iL). However, blastocysts underwent spontaneous differentiation, and ESCs were not established under LowGiL condition. Time-course analysis showed that 2iL condition for three days from the initiation of culture was sufficient for the acquisition of permanent pluripotency. Although X chromosome-linked pluripotent genes were significantly up-regulated during the culture of both male and female blastocysts in 2iL condition, no such up-regulation was observed in LowGiL condition. In conclusion, 2iL-dependent activation of these X-linked genes at the earliest phase of ESC derivation is one of the molecular bases for the acquisition of permanent pluripotency.",

The underlying genetic basis of MODY disorders is haploinsufficiency, where loss-of-function mutations in a single allele cause the diabetic phenotype in heterozygous patients. MODY1 is a type of MODY disorder resulting from a mutation in the transcription factor hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4\u03b1). In order to establish a human based model to study MODY1, we generated patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Differentiation of these pluripotent cells towards the pancreatic lineage enabled to evaluate the effects of the MODY1 mutation and its impact on endodermal and pancreatic cells. Analyzing the gene expression profiles of differentiated MODY1 cells, revealed the outcome of HNF4\u03b1 haploinsufficiency on its targets. This molecular analysis suggests that the differential expression of HNF4\u03b1 target genes in MODY1 is affected by the number of HNF4\u03b1 binding sites, their distance from the transcription start site, and the number of other transcription factor binding sites. These features may help explain the molecular manifestations of haploinsufficiency in MODY1 disease.",

During skeletal muscle development and regeneration, mononuclear progenitor cells (myoblasts) fuse to form multinuclear myotubes, which mature and become myofibers. The molecular events mediating myoblast fusion are not fully understood. Here we report that Shisa2, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein, regulates the fusion of muscle satellite cell-derived primary myoblasts. Shisa2 expression is repressed by Notch signaling, elevated in activated compared to quiescent satellite cells, and further upregulated during myogenic differentiation. Knockdown of Shisa2 inhibits the fusion of myoblasts without affecting proliferation. Conversely, Shisa2 overexpression in proliferating myoblasts inhibits their proliferation but promotes premature fusion. Interestingly, Shisa2-overexpressing nascent myotubes actively recruit myoblasts to fuse with. At the molecular level, Rac1/Cdc42-mediated cytoskeletal F-actin remodeling is required for Shisa2 to promote myoblast fusion. These results provide a novel mechanism through which an ER protein regulates myogenesis.",

In this study, we use ChIP-Seq to identify Dppa4 binding genome-wide in three distinct cell types: mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC), embryonal carcinoma cells, and 3T3 fibroblasts ectopically expressing Dppa4. We find a core set of Dppa4 binding sites shared across cell types, and also a substantial number of sites unique to each cell type. Across cell types Dppa4 shows a preference for binding to regions with active chromatin signatures, and can influence chromatin modifications at target genes. In 3T3 fibroblasts with enforced Dppa4 expression, Dppa4 represses the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn2c and activates Ets family transcription factor Etv4, leading to alterations in the cell cycle that likely contribute to the oncogenic phenotype. Dppa4 also directly regulates Etv4 in mESC but represses it in this context, and binds with Oct4 to a set of shared targets that are largely independent of Sox2 and Nanog, indicating that Dppa4 functions independently of the core pluripotency network in stem cells. Together these data provide novel insights into Dppa4 function in both pluripotent and oncogenic contexts.",

Here we investigate whether skin-derived precursor cells (SKPs), which have the potential to differentiate into mesodermal and peripheral neural cell types, undergo directed migration in the presence of an EF. We found that EF application promotes SKP migration towards the anode. The migratory response is substrate-dependent as SKPs undergo directed migration on laminin and Matrigel, but not collagen. The majority of SKPs express the undifferentiated cell markers nestin, fibronectin and Sox2, after both EF application and in sister cultures with no EF application, suggesting that EFs do not promote cell differentiation. Co-cultures of SKPs and brain-derived neural precursor cells (NPCs), a population of cells that undergo rapid, cathode-directed migration, reveal that in the presence of NPCs an increased percentage of SKPs undergo galvanotaxis, providing evidence that cells can provide cues to modify the galvanotactic response. We propose that a better understanding of SKP migration in the presence of EFs may provide insight into improved strategies for wound repair.",

Cryopreservation is usually performed with dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO), in addition to animal proteins.

Our study aimed to test trehalose-based cryosolutions containing ethylene glycol (EG) or glycerol (GLY) on hESCs RC17, hiPSCs CTR2#6 and long-term neuroepithelial-like stem cells (lt-NES) AF22. Here, we demostrate the effectiveness of these cryosolutions in hPSCs by showing an acceptable rate of cell viability and high stability compared to standard 10% DMSO freezing medium (CS10). All cell lines retained their morphology, self renewal potential and pluripotency, and none of the cryosolutions affected their differentiation potential. Genotoxicity varied among different stem cells types, while trehalose-based cryopreservation did not sensibly alter the homeostasis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER).

We show here that NOSTRIN levels increased in both mouse and rat placenta during gestation. NOSTRIN expression was not co-related to expression of eNOS precluding its eNOS mediated function. NOSTRIN transcripts were identified in trophoblast cells of the placenta, predominantly in trophoblast giant cells (TGC). Precocious over-expression of NOSTRIN during differentiation of trophoblast stem cells led to up-regulation of genetic markers associated with invasion (Prl4a1, Prl2a1) and TGC formation (Prl2c2, Prl3d1, Prl3b1). The functional consequence of NOSTRIN over-expression was increased TGC formation and trophoblast cell invasion. Furthermore, number of polyploid TGCs that arise by endoreduplication, were higher in presence of NOSTRIN. Early induction of NOSTRIN was associated with substantial decrease in G/F actin ratio and augmentation of N-WASP-Dynamin-NOSTRIN ternary complex formation that might be partially responsible for nucleation of actin filaments. NOSTRIN also formed a complex with Cdk1 and increased phosphorylation of T14 and Y15 residues that inhibits cytokinesis. Interestingly, SH3 domain deleted NOSTRIN was ineffective in eliciting NOSTRIN's function in differentiating trophoblast cells.

In our previous publication, we described an integrated microcarrier-based wave reactor process for the expansion and differentiation of hPSCs to CMs on a rocker based platform. However, this platform is limited in terms of linear scalability and CMs purity. The present study describes ways to overcome these limitations by the use of a stirred scalable platform and incorporation of an additional lactate based purification step which increases CM purity.Efficient CM differentiation in stirred spinners was achieved by (1) Addition of ascorbic acid (AS) during the differentiation phase which resulted in an increase of 38.42% in CM yield (0.84\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.03\u202f\u00d7\u202f106vs 1.17\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f106\u202fCM/mL for cultures without AS and with AS respectively) and (2) Change of agitation regime to a shorter static intervals one (from 66\u202fmin off/6\u202fmin on (66/6) to 8\u202fmin off/1\u202fmin on (8/1)) during the first 3\u202fdays of differentiation which resulted in 22% increase in CM yield (1.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202f\u00d7\u202f106vs 1.23\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.07\u202f\u00d7\u202f106\u202fCM/mL). The combination of AS addition and change in agitation regime resulted in a production yield of 1.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.10\u202f\u00d7\u202f106\u202fCM/mL which is comparable to that achieved in the rocker platform as described before (1.61\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.36\u202f\u00d7\u202f106\u202fCM/mL).Increase in CM purity was achieved by changing of culture medium to RPMI1640 (without glucose)\u202f+\u202f5\u202fmM lactate +0.6\u202fmM AS at day 10 of differentiation which resulted in 44.5% increase in CM purity at day 15. The increase in purity of CMs was due to the death of the non-CM cells (~76% of cell death). It is important to note that in the absence of glucose, lactate was consumed at a rate of 0.01\u202fmmol/106\u202fcells/h. Addition of glucose, even in small amounts, during the purification step prevents the process of CM purification, due to the growth of the non-CM cell population.In summary, hPSC (hESC-HES3 and hiPSC-IMR90) can be efficiently differentiated to CMs in a scalable spinner process which integrates 7\u202fdays of expansion (3.01\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.51\u202f\u00d7\u202f106 to 3.50\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.65\u202f\u00d7\u202f106\u202fcells/mL) followed by 10\u202fdays of WNT modulated CM differentiation and 5\u202fdays of lactate based purification.

Moreover, the combination of high serum medium and matrigel coating provided a proliferation advantage to myogenic cells, which expanded rapidly (~24\u202fh population doubling), while non-myogenic cells diminished over time, thereby eliminating the need for further purification steps such as FACS sorting. Finally, myogenic progenitors gave rise to multinucleated myotubes that exhibited sarcomeres and spontaneous beating in the culture dish.",

Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in NEK1 (NIMA-related kinase 1) have also been recently found to cause ALS. NEK1 codes for a multifunctional protein, crucially involved in mitotic checkpoint control and DDR. To resolve pathological alterations associated with NEK1 mutation, we compared hiPSC-derived motoneurons carrying a NEK1 mutation with mutant C9orf72 and wild type neurons at basal level and after DNA damage induction. Motoneurons carrying a C9orf72 mutation exhibited cell specific signs of increased DNA damage. This phenotype was even more severe in NEK1c.2434A>T neurons that showed significantly increased DNA damage at basal level and impaired DDR after induction of DNA damage in an maturation-dependent manner. Our results provide first mechanistic insight in pathophysiological alterations induced by NEK1 mutations and point to a converging pathomechanism of different gene mutations causative for ALS. Therefore, our study contributes to the development of novel therapeutic strategies to reduce DNA damage accumulation in neurodegenerative diseases and ALS.",

In the present study, we dissected further the mechanisms by which endothelial cells trigger endoderm hepatic specification. Using our previously established in vitro mouse ESC system mimicking the early hepatic specification process, endoderm cells were purified and co-cultured with endothelial cells to induce hepatic specification. The comparison of transcriptome profiles between hepatic endoderm cells isolated from co-cultures and endoderm cells cultured alone revealed that VEGF signaling instructs hepatic specification of endoderm cells through endothelial VEGFR2 activation. Additionally, epigenetic mark inhibition assays upon co-cultures uncovered that histone acetylation and DNA methylation promote hepatic specification while histone methylation inhibits it. This study provides an efficient 2D platform modelling the endothelial cell niche crosstalk with endoderm, and reveals mechanisms by which endothelial cells promote hepatic specification of mouse ESC-derived endoderm cells through endothelial VEGFR2 activation and endoderm epigenetic modifications.",

     "abstract": "The use of mice that are mosaic for reporter gene expression underlies many lineage-tracing studies in stem cell biology. For example, using mosaic LacZ reporter mice, it was shown that limbal epithelial stem cells (LESCs) around the periphery of the cornea maintain radial sectors of the corneal epithelium and that radial stripe numbers declined with age. Originally, the corneal results were interpreted as progressive, age-related loss or irreversible inactivation of some LESC clones. In this study we used computer simulations to show that these results could also be explained by stochastic replacement of LESCs by neighbouring LESCs, leading to neutral drift of LESC populations. This was shown to reduce the number of coherent clones of LESCs and hence would coarsen the mosaic pattern in the corneal epithelium without reducing the absolute number of LESCs. Simulations also showed that corrected stripe numbers declined more slowly when LESCs were grouped non-randomly and that mosaicism was rarely lost unless simulated LESC numbers were unrealistically low. Possible reasons why age-related changes differ between mosaic corneal epithelia and other systems, such as adrenal cortices and intestinal crypts, are discussed.",

While much insight into brown fat biology has been gained from murine cell lines and models, few resources are available to study human brown fat in vitro, which makes the need for new ways to derive and study human brown adipocytes imperative. Human ES cell based reporter systems present an excellent tool to identify, mark, and purify cell populations of choice. In this study, we detail the derivation and characterization of a novel human ES UCP1 reporter cell line that marks UCP1 positive adipocytes in vitro. We targeted a mCherry reporter to the UCP1 stop codon via CRISPR-Cas9 based gene targeting. The brown adipocytes derived from reporter cells express UCP1, display high mitochondrial content, multi-locular lipid morphology, and exhibit functional properties such as lipolysis. The mCherry positive cells purified after cell sorting show elevated expression of brown fat marker genes and a high similarity to isolated human brown fat via RNA-seq analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this reporter to real time monitor UCP1 expression upon stimulation. This reporter cell line thus presents new opportunities to study human brown fat biology by enabling future work to understand early human brown fat development, perform disease modeling, and facilitate drug screening.",

Domestic dogs are useful translational models in regenerative medicine, but their embryonic stem cells (cESCs) remain narrowly investigated. Primed-like cESCs expanded in the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor and fibroblast growth factor 2 (LIF-FGF2) acquire features of na\u00efve pluripotency when exposed to chemical inhibitors and LIF (2iL). However, proliferation of cESCs is influenced by the pluripotent state and is comparatively slower than human or mouse PSCs. We propose that different metabolic pathway activities support ATP generation and biomass accumulation necessary for LIF-FGF2 and 2iL cESC proliferation. We found that 2iL cESCs have greater respiratory capacity, altered mitochondrial chain complex stoichiometry and elevated mitochondrial polarization state. Yet, 2iL-enriched cESCs exhibited immature ultrastructure, including previously unrecognized changes to cristae organization. Enhanced ATP level in 2iL cESCs is associated with altered retrograde signalling, whereas LIF-FGF2 cESCs exhibit a lipogenic phenotype. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation impaired proliferation and ATP production in 2iL cESCs but not LIF-FGF2 cESCs, which remained sensitive to glycolysis inhibition. Our study reveals distinct bioenergetic mechanisms contributing to steady-state expansion of distinct canine pluripotent states that can be exploited to improve derivation and culture of canine PSCs.",

In this study, given the seminal role of TDP-43 in ALS pathophysiology, MNs were obtained from peripheral blood mononuclear cells-derived iPSCs of an ALS patient carrying a p.A382T TARDBP mutation and a healthy donor. Venous samples were preferred to fibroblasts for their ease of collection and no requirement for time consuming extended cultures before experimentation. iPSCs were characterized for expression of specific markers, spontaneously differentiated into primary germ layers and, finally, into MNs. No differences were observed between the mutated ALS patient and the control MNs with most of the cells displaying a nuclear localization of the TDP-43 protein. In conclusion, we here demonstrated for the first time that human TARDBP mutated MNs can be successfully obtained exploiting the reprogramming and differentiation ability of peripheral blood cells, an easily accessible source from any patient.",

Thus, we induced quiescence in BMSC in vitro by (a) suspension culture in a viscous medium or (b) culture on soft polyacrylamide substrate; and examined their molecular and functional phenotype. Induction of G0 was confirmed by bromo-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labelling and analysis of cell cycle gene expression. Upon reactivation and re-entry into cell cycle, G0 state-BMSC exhibited enhanced clonogenic self-renewal, preferential differentiation into osteoblastic rather than adipocytic cells and increased ectopic bone formation when implanted subcutaneously in vivo in immune-deficient mice, compared to asynchronous proliferating (pre-G0) BMSC. Global gene expression profiling revealed reprogramming of the transcriptome during G0 state including significant alterations in relevant pathways and expression of secreted factors, suggesting altered autocrine and paracrine signaling by G0 state-BMSC and a possible mechanism for enhanced bone formation. G0 state-BMSC might provide a clinically relevant model for understanding the in vivo biology of BMSC.",

     "abstract": "We have investigated the differentiation of paraxial mesoderm from mouse embryonic stem cells utilizing a Tbx6-EYFP/Brachyury (T)-Cherry dual reporter system. Differentiation from the mouse ESC state directly into mesoderm via Wnt pathway activation was low, but augmented by treatment with AGN193109, a pan-retinoic acid receptor inverse agonist. After five days of differentiation, T+ cells increased from 12.2% to 18.8%, Tbx6+ cells increased from 5.8% to 12.7%, and T+/Tbx6+ cells increased from 2.4% to 14.1%. The synergism of AGN193109 with Wnt3a/CHIR99021 was further substantiated by the increased expression of paraxial mesoderm gene markers Tbx6, Msgn1, Meox1, and Hoxb1. Separate to inverse agonist treatment, when mouse ESCs were indirectly differentiated into mesoderm via a transient epiblast step the efficiency of paraxial mesoderm formation markedly increased. Tbx6+ cells represented 65\u201375% of the total cell population after just 3\u202fdays of differentiation and the expression of paraxial mesoderm marker genes Tbx6 and Msgn increased over 100-fold and 300-fold, respectively. Further evaluation of AGN193109 treatment on the indirect differentiation protocol suggested that RARs have two distinct roles. First, AGN193109 treatment at the epiblast step and mesoderm step promoted paraxial mesoderm formation over other mesoderm and endoderm lineage types. Second, continued treatment during mesoderm formation revealed its ability to repress the maturation of presomitic mesoderm into somitic paraxial mesoderm. Thus, the continuous treatment of AGN193109 during epiblast and mesoderm differentiation steps yielded a culture where ~90% of the cells were Tbx6+. The surprisingly early effect of inverse agonist treatment at the epiblast step of differentiation led us to further examine the effect of AGN193109 treatment during an extended epiblast differentiation protocol. Interestingly, while inverse agonist treatment had no impact on the conversion of ESCs into epiblast cells based on the expression of Rex1, Fgf5, and pluripotency marker genes Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2, after three days of differentiation in the presence of AGN193109 caudal epiblast and early paraxial mesoderm marker genes, T, Cyp26a1, Fgf8, Tbx6 and Msgn were all highly up-regulated. Collectively, our studies reveal an earlier than appreciated role for RARs in epiblast cells and the modulation of their function via inverse agonist treatment can promote their differentiation into the paraxial mesoderm lineage.",

As stem cells in general, P19 cells are characterized by a low respiration activity, accompanied by a low level of ROS formation. Nevertheless, we found that P19 cells contain fully assembled mitochondrial electron transport chain supercomplexes (respirasomes), suggesting that low respiration activity may serve as a protective mechanism against ROS. Upon elevated mitochondrial ROS formation, the proliferative potential of P19 cells is decreased due to longer S phase of the cell cycle. Our data show that besides being harmful, mitochondrial ROS production regulates the differentiation potential of P19 cells: elevated mitochondrial ROS level favours trophoblast differentiation, whereas preventing neuron differentiation. Therefore, our results suggest that mitochondrial ROS level serves as an important factor that directs differentiation towards certain cell types while preventing others.",

By comparing the expression profiles of FL-derived LSKs in Vav-Cre;PDK1f/f embryos to the controls, we found that the BH3-only protein PUMA and the cyclin family proteins were expressed higher in the Vav-Cre;PDK1f/f group, which may account for the increased apoptosis and activated cell cycle in the deficient HSCs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the expression of FoxO3a was higher in PDK1-deficient LSKs, indicating that the Akt-FoxO3a-PUMA axis may participate in regulating LSKs apoptosis in the E15.5 FL. In contrast, FoxO1 expression was lower in PDK1-deficient LSK cells, suggesting that Akt-FoxO1-CCND may regulate the HSC cell cycle.

Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling plays a key role in promoting keratinocyte proliferation in the hair follicles and in the interfollicular epidermis. A recent report demonstrated that epidermal YAP activity drives \u03b2-catenin activation to promote keratinocyte proliferation in the murine skin. However, it remains unclear whether this is caused by paracrine activation of canonical Wnt signaling or through other YAP/\u03b2-catenin regulatory interactions. In the present study, we found that XAV939-inhibition of canonical WNT signaling in skin of YAP2-5SA-\u0394C mice resulted in diminished \u03b2-catenin activation, reduced keratinocyte proliferation, and a mitigation of the hyperplastic abnormalities in the interfollicular epidermis, signifying a canonical WNT ligand-dependent mechanism. Our subsequent analyses determined that WNT16 is produced in response to YAP activity in keratinocytes both in vitro and in vivo, and that WNT16 drives HaCaT keratinocyte proliferation via canonical WNT16/\u03b2-catenin signaling.

This study delineates a fundamental YAP-driven mechanism that controls normal skin regeneration, and that may be perturbed in human regenerative disease displaying increased YAP and WNT signaling activity.",

Methods used today are costly, time consuming and exhaust the limited number of cells needed for transplantation. The aim of this study was to analyze if surplus plasma from CB contains biomarkers that can predict HSPC content in CB. Frozen, surplus plasma from 95 CB units was divided into two groups based on CD34+ cell concentration. Birth weight, gestation age, gender, mode of delivery, collection volume, nucleated cell count and colony forming unit assay results were available. Samples were analyzed with a proximity ligation assay covering 92 different proteins. Two-group t-test with p-values adjusted for false discovery rate (FDR) identified 5 proteins that significantly differed between the two groups. CDCP1 was the most significant (FDR adjusted p-value 0.006). Correlation with CDCP1 concentration was most significant for CD34+ concentration and nucleated cell count. Multivariate analysis showed that CD34 and gender seemed to influence the level of CDCP1. In conclusion, CDCP1 was identified as a potential biomarker of HSPC content in CB. The finding also warrants further investigation for a possible role of CDCP1 in regulating HSPC presence in CB.",

Here, we investigated the effects of human recombinant plasma gelsolin (pGSN) on human immature erythroblasts. CD34+ cells isolated from cord blood were differentiated into erythroid cells in serum-free medium. When pGSN was applied to the culture medium, it accelerated basophilic and polychromatic erythroblast maturation and increased the enucleation rate with highly expressed erythropoiesis-related mRNAs. Also, pGSN was effective in reducing dysplastic changes caused by vincristine, suggesting its role in cell cycle progression at G2/M checkpoints. Also, pGSN activated caspase-3 during maturation stages in which caspase-3 functions as a non-apoptotic maturational signal or a pro-apoptotic signal depending on maturation stages. Our results suggest that pGSN has a pivotal role in maturation of erythroblasts and this factor might be one of the way how bone marrow macrophages and previously unknown serum factors work to control erythropoiesis. pGSN might be used as additive for in vitro production of erythrocytes.",

During adipocyte differentiation, hMSCs exhibit significant changes in cell morphology suggesting changes in cytoskeletal organization. Here, we examined the effect of direct modulation of actin microfilament dynamics on adipocyte differentiation. Stabilizing actin filaments in hMSCs by siRNA-mediated knock down of the two main actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs): Cofilin 1 (CFL1) and Destrin (DSTN) or treating the cells by Phalloidin reduced adipocyte differentiation as evidenced by decreased number of mature adipocytes and decreased adipocyte specific gene expression (ADIPOQ, LPL, PPARG, FABP4). In contrast, disruption of actin cytoskeleton by Cytochalasin D enhanced adipocyte differentiation. Follow up studies revealed that the effects of CFL1 on adipocyte differentiation depended on the activity of LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) which is the major upstream kinase of CFL1. Inhibiting LIMK by its specific chemical inhibitor LIMKi inhibited the phosphorylation of CFL1 and actin polymerization, and enhanced the adipocyte differentiation. Moreover, treating hMSCs by Cytochalasin D inhibited ERK and Smad2 signaling and this was associated with enhanced adipocyte differentiation. On the other hand, Phalloidin enhanced ERK and Smad2 signaling, but inhibited adipocyte differentiation which was rescued by ERK specific chemical inhibitor U0126.

However, a mechanistic understanding of the transcriptional control during the neuronal differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), a promising cellular model for mental disorders, remains elusive. Here, we carried out additional analyses on our recently published open chromatin regions (OCRs) profiling at different stages of hiPSC neuronal differentiation. We found that the dynamic changes of OCR during neuronal differentiation highlighted cell stage-specific gene networks, and the chromatin accessibility at the core promoter region of a gene correlates with the corresponding transcript abundance. Within the cell stage-specific OCRs, we identified the binding of cell stage-specific TFs and observed a lag of a neuronal TF binding behind the mRNA expression of the corresponding TF. Interestingly, binding footprints of NEUROD1 and NEUROG2, both of which induce high efficient conversion of hiPSCs to glutamatergic neurons, were among those most enriched in the relatively mature neurons. Furthermore, TF network analysis showed that both NEUROD1 and NEUROG2 were present in the same core TF network specific to more mature neurons, suggesting a pivotal mechanism of epigenetic control of neuronal differentiation and maturation. Our study provides novel insights into the epigenetic control of glutamatergic neurogenesis in the context of TF networks, which may be instrumental to improving hiPSC modeling of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

To overcome this problem, we developed a video-based motion detection software relying on the optical flow by Farneb\u00e4ck that we call cBRA (cardiac beat rate analyzer). The beating characteristics of the differentiated cardiac clusters were calculated based on the local displacement between two subsequent images. Two differentiation protocols, which profoundly differ in the morphology of cardiac clusters generated and in the expression of cardiac markers, were used and the resulting CM were characterized. Despite these differences, beat rates and beating variabilities could be reliably determined using cBRA. Likewise, stimulation of \u03b2-adrenoreceptors by isoproterenol could easily be identified in the hESC-derived CM. Since even subtle changes in the beating features are detectable, this method is suitable for high throughput cardiotoxicity screenings.",

Although cryo-banking of fish gametes might ultimately help conserve endangered fish, cryopreservation of fish eggs or embryos is still not possible due to their large size and high yolk content.

Transplantation of cryopreserved germ cells into the body cavity of allogeneic or xenogeneic recipients sterilized by triploidization or endogenous germ cell ablation resulted in migration of the transplanted germ cells toward the recipient genital ridges, where they were eventually incorporated. The donor-derived germ cells initiated either spermatogenesis or oogenesis in the recipient gonads, depending on the sex of the recipient. Furthermore, by mating the male and female recipients, viable offspring derived from the frozen germ cells were produced.

     "abstract": "Historically, research in spermatogonial biology has been hindered by a lack of validated approaches to identify and isolate pure populations of the various spermatogonial subsets for in-depth analysis. In particular, although a number of markers of the undifferentiated spermatogonial population have now been characterized, standardized methodology for assessing their specificity to the spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) and transit amplifying progenitor pools has been lacking. To date, SSC content within an undefined population of spermatogonia has been inferred using either lineage tracing or spermatogonial transplantation analyses which generate qualitative and quantitative data, respectively. Therefore, these techniques are not directly comparable, and are subject to variable interpretations as to a readout that is representative of a \u2018pure\u2019 SSC population. We propose standardization across the field for determining the SSC purity of a population via use of a limiting dilution transplantation assay that would eliminate subjectivity and help to minimize the generation of inconsistent data on \u2018SSC\u2019 populations. In the limiting dilution transplantation assay, a population of LacZ-expressing spermatogonia are selected based on a putative SSC marker, and a small, defined number of cells (i.e. 10 cells) are microinjected into the testis of a germ cell-deficient recipient mouse. Using colony counts and an estimated colonization efficiency of 5%; a quantitative value can be calculated that represents SSC purity in the starting population. The utilization of this technique would not only be useful to link functional relevance to novel markers that will be identified in the future, but also for providing validation of purity for marker-selected populations of spermatogonia that are commonly considered to be SSCs by many researchers in the field of spermatogenesis and stem cell biology.",

These populations represent the motor neuron subgroup that is primarily affected by a severe form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with bulbar onset and worst prognosis. This goal was achieved by stable integration of an inducible vector, based on the piggyBac transposon, allowing controlled activation of Ngn2, Isl1 and Phox2a (NIP).

Moreover, the gliogenic response to fasudil medium was observed in both early postnatal and adult NSC cultures.Taken together, our results show that fasudil promotes the differentiation of NSCs into astroglial lineage, suggesting that it could be used to develop novel vitro gliogenesis models and regulate differentiation for neural repair.",

Culturing hBMSCs using a particular environmental factor (hypoxia) and with the addition of FGF-2 increased the cellular proliferation rate while enhancing the regenerative potential, modulated the multipotency-related processes (enhanced chondrogenesis-related processes/osteogenesis, but reduced adipogenesis), and increased cellular migration and collagen formation. The gene expression levels in the experimental samples showed activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 pathway and glycolysis in the hypoxic condition, with this not being affected by the addition of FGF-2.

In the present study, we assessed expression, functionality, and subunit composition of endogenous NMDARs in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived cortical neurons (iCell Neurons and iCell GlutaNeurons). We initially confirmed the expected pharmacological response of iCell Neurons and iCell GlutaNeurons to NMDA by patch-clamp recordings. Subsequent pharmacological interrogation using GluN2 subunit-selective antagonists revealed the predominance of GluN2B in both iCell Neurons and iCell GlutaNeurons. This observation was also supported by qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses of GluN2 subunit expression as well as pharmacological experiments using positive allosteric modulators with distinct GluN2 subunit selectivity. We conclude that iCell Neurons and iCell GlutaNeurons express functional GluN2B-containing NMDARs and could serve as a valuable system for development and validation of GluN2B-modulating pharmaceutical agents.",

We hypothesise that they participate in cardiac homeostasis and repair through their actions as lineage progenitors and paracrine signaling hubs. However, cCFU-F are rare and there are no specific markers for these cells, making them challenging to study. cCFU can self-renew in vitro, although the common use of serum has made it difficult to identify cytokines that maintain lineage identity and self-renewal ability. Cell heterogeneity is an additional confounder as cCFU-F cultures are metastable. Here, we address these limitations by identifying serum-free medium (SFM) for growth, and by using cCFU-F isolated from PdgfraGFP/+ mice to record fate outcomes, morphology and PDGFR\u03b1 expression for hundreds of single cells over time. We show that SFM supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and platelet-derived growth factor, enhanced cCFU-F colony formation and long-term self-renewal, while maintaining cCFU-F potency. cCFU-F cultured in SFM maintained a higher proportion of PDGFR\u03b1+ cells, a marker of self-renewing cCFU-F, by increasing Pdgfra-GFP+ divisions and reducing the probability of spontaneous myofibroblast differentiation.",

To examine PRDM14 in human GCTs we profiled human GCT cell lines and patient samples and discovered that PRDM14 is expressed in embryonal carcinoma cell lines, embryonal carcinomas, seminomas, intracranial germinomas and yolk sac tumors, but is not expressed in teratomas. To model constitutive overexpression in human PGCs, we generated PGC-like cells (PGCLCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and discovered that elevated expression of PRDM14 does not block early PGC formation.

It is characterized by partial or full thickness loss of muscle and its bio-scaffold, resulting in extensive fibrosis and scar formation. Therefore, the ideal therapeutic option is to use stem cells combined with bio-scaffolds to restore muscle. For this purpose, muscle-derived stem cells (MDSCs) are a great candidate due to their unique multi-lineage differentiation potential.In this study, we evaluated the regeneration potential of MDSCs for muscle loss repair using a novel in situ fibrin gel casting. Muscle defect was created by a partial thickness wedge resection in the tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of NSG mice which created an average of 25% mass loss. If untreated, this defect leads to severe muscle fibrosis. Next, MDSCs were delivered using a novel in situ fibrin gel casting method.Our results demonstrated MDSCs are able to engraft and form new myofibers in the defect when casted along with fibrin gel. LacZ labeled MDSCs were able to differentiate efficiently into new myofibers and significantly increase muscle mass. This was also accompanied by significant reduction of fibrotic tissue in the engrafted muscles. Furthermore, transplanted cells also contributed to new vessel formation and satellite cell seeding.These results confirmed the therapeutic potential of MDSCs and feasibility of direct in situ casting of fibrin/MDSC mixture to repair muscle mass defects.",

PCR array analyses revealed upregulation of 26 and 12 pro-inflammatory cytokines upon A2E and H2O2 exposure respectively, indicating that A2E and H2O2 can cause inflammation in human retinas.

We used human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neuronal cells (iN cells) from sporadic AD (SAD) patients and healthy control subjects (HCS) to show aberrant mitochondrial function in patient-derived cells. We observed that neuronal cultures from some patients produced more ROS and displayed higher levels of DNA damage.

Surprisingly, these effects neither correlated with A\u03b2 nor phosphorylated and total tau levels. Synaptic protein levels were also unaffected in SAD iN cells.

Here, we studied two hPSC lines, both of which initially showed good neuronal differentiation capacity. However, the propensity for endogenous astrogenesis and maturation state after extended differentiation varied. Live cell calcium imaging revealed that prolonged differentiation facilitated maturation of GABAergic signaling. According to extracellular recordings with microelectrode array (MEA), neuronal activity was limited to fewer areas of the culture, which expressed more frequent burst activity. Efficient maturation after prolonged differentiation also promoted organization of spontaneous activity by burst compaction. These results suggest that although prolonged neural differentiation can be challenging, it has beneficial effect on functional maturation, which can also improve transition to different neural in vitro models and applications.",

The progenitor cells (undifferentiated A spermatogonia) expand in number via the formation of syncytial chains by mitosis. The mechanism by which these progenitor cells commit to meiosis and spermatogenesis is tightly controlled and results in complex morphological organization all of which is designed to efficiently achieve large numbers of spermatozoa. The major extrinsic factor that triggers the commitment to meiosis and establishes the structural complexity is retinoic acid (RA). Retinoic acid is produced from retinol via two oxidation steps in low abundance near its site of action. The action of RA on undifferentiated A spermatogonia results in the timed progression of these progenitor cells into the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium. We have utilized a drug WIN 18,446 that inhibits the second oxidation step in RA biosynthesis to block the progression of undifferentiated A spermatogonia in the mouse testis. As a result of this block the undifferentiated progenitor cells accumulate but do not differentiate into A1 spermatogonia. When the block is released and a bolus of RA is simultaneously administered the accumulated spermatogonia progress through the differentiation pathway in complete synchrony and maintain that synchrony with regard to stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium for several months. This procedure allowed us to accumulate sufficient material to measure retinoic acid levels across the cycle and will allow us to isolate and analyze large number of progenitor cells proceeding synchronously down the pathway to meiosis. We have been able to show that the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium is established and maintained by pulses of RA that appear at stages VIII and IX of the cycle.",

Here we review current methods for human naive pluripotent culture and collate a list of cell surface antigens that have been identified as markers to differentiate naive from primed human pluripotent stem cells. While these culture systems do display marker variability, and not all antigens mentioned were assessed in all methods, this review provides a resource for researchers of the human naive pluripotent stem cell state. SSEA-4, SSEA-3, CD24, CD75, CD7, CD77, CD130/GP130, CD57, CD90 and NLGN4X were all found to have a +/\u2212 expression profile in at least 2 methods, while +/\u2212 expression of Tra-1-81, CDH3, CD172a, CD107b, CD229 was reported in one method. Often it was reported that naive and primed cells could be defined using a low/medium/high expression of the following antigens TRA-1-60, PCDH1, GPR64, MHC Class I, however these markers were more likely to display expression pattern differences between methods.

     "abstract": "A bone-remodeling imbalance induced by increased bone resorption and osteoclast formation causes skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis. Induction of osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) leads to bone regeneration. Many researchers have tried to develop new adjuvants as specific stimulators of bone regeneration for therapeutic use in patients with bone resorption. We tried to develop a new adjuvant that has stronger osteogenic differentiation-promoting activity than bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In this study, we identified a new peptide, which we called bone-forming peptide (BFP)-3, derived from the immature precursor of BMP-7. Upon osteogenic differentiation, BMSCs treated with BFP-3 exhibited higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization ability and significantly up-regulated expression of osteogenic genes such as ALP, osteocalcin (OC), Osterix, and Runx2 compared with control BMSCs. Furthermore, fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunofluorescence analyses demonstrated that BFP-3 treatment up-regulated CD44 expression. Interestingly, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Smad1/5/8 phosphorylation was increased by BFP-3 treatment during osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, BFP-3-induced osteogenic differentiation was significantly decreased by treatment with ERK1/2- and Smad-specific inhibitors. These results suggest that BFP-3 plays an important role in regulating osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs through increasing levels of osteogenic-inducing factors and regulating the ERK1/2 and Smad1/5/8 signaling pathways. Our finding indicates that BFP-3 may be a potential new therapeutic target for promoting bone formation.",

Individuals displaying dysregulated macrophage functions are proposed to be prone to inflammatory disorders or infections. However, this being a cause or a consequence of the pathology remains often unclear. In this context, we isolated and expanded CD34\u00a0+ HSCs from healthy blood donors and derived them into CD14\u00a0+ myeloid progenitors which were further enriched and differentiated into macrophages. Aiming for a comprehensive phenotypic profiling, we generated whole-cell mass spectrometry (WCMS) fingerprints of cell samples collected along the different stages of the differentiation process to build a predictive model using a linear discriminant analysis based on principal components. Through the capacity of the model to accurately predict sample's identity of a validation set, we demonstrate that WCMS profiles obtained from bona fide blood monocytes and respectively derived macrophages mirror profiles obtained from equivalent HSC derivatives. Finally, HSC-derived macrophage functionalities were assessed by quantifying cytokine and chemokine responses to a TLR agonist in a 34-plex luminex assay and by measuring their capacity to phagocytise mycobacteria. These functional read-outs could not discriminate blood monocytes-derived from HSC-derived macrophages. To conclude, we propose that this method opens new avenues to distinguish the impact of human genetics on the dysregulated biological properties of macrophages in pathological conditions.",

However, systemic and intrinsic factors decrease the myogenic differentiation potential of satellite cells thereby impairing muscle regeneration. Here we present data showing that late passage C2C12 myoblasts exhibited significantly impaired myogenic differentiation potential that was accompanied by impaired expression of myogenic regulatory factors (Myf5, MyoD, Myogenin, and MRF4) and members of myocyte enhancer factor 2 family. Notably, ectopic expression of NANOG preserved the morphology and restored the myogenic differentiation capacity of late passage myoblasts, possibly by restoring the expression level of these myogenic factors. Muscle regeneration was effective in 2D cultures and in 3D skeletal microtissues mimicking the skeletal muscle niche. The presence of NANOG was required for at least 15\u00a0days to reverse the impaired differentiation potential of myoblasts. However, it was critical to remove NANOG during the process of maturation, as it inhibited myotube formation. Finally, myoblasts that were primed by NANOG maintained their differentiation capacity for 20\u00a0days after NANOG withdrawal, suggesting potential epigenetic changes. In conclusion, these results shed light on the potential of NANOG to restore the myogenic differentiation potential of myoblasts, which is impaired after multiple rounds of cellular division, and to reverse the loss of muscle regeneration.",

     "abstract": "During early development in placental mammals, proper trophoblast lineage development is essential for implantation and placentation. Defects in this lineage can cause early pregnancy failures and other pregnancy disorders. However, transcription factors controlling trophoblast development remain poorly understood. Here, we utilize Fosl1, previously implicated in trophoblast giant cell development as a member of the AP-1 complex, to trans-differentiate embryonic stem (ES) cells to trophoblast lineage-like cells. We first show that the ectopic expression of Fosl1 is sufficient to induce trophoblast-specific gene expression programs in ES cells. Surprisingly, we find that this transcriptional reprogramming occurs independently of changes in levels of ES cell core factors during the cell fate change. This suggests that Fosl1 acts in a novel way to orchestrate the ES to trophoblast cell fate conversion compared to previously known reprogramming factors. Mapping of Fosl1 targets reveals that Fosl1 directly activates TE lineage-specific genes as a pioneer factor. Our work suggests Fosl1 may be used to reprogram ES cells into differentiated cell types in trophoblast lineage, which not only enhances our knowledge of global trophoblast gene regulation but also may provide a future therapeutic tool for generating induced trophoblast cells from patient-derived pluripotent stem cells.",

Patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have become a powerful tool for understanding the pathogenesis of intractable diseases, as well as for phenotype screening, which can serve as the basis for developing new drugs. However, it is necessary to develop an efficient and reproducible myogenic differentiation system. Previously, we reported a tetracycline-inducible MyoD overexpression model of myogenic differentiation using human iPSCs (hiPSCs). However, this model has certain disadvantages that limit its use in various applications, such as a drug screening.

Cellular models aim to recapitulate basic functional features of their in vivo counterparts or tissues in order to be of use in in vitro disease modeling or drug screening and testing. Understanding how culture systems affect in vitro development of human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derivatives allows optimization of cellular human models and gives insight in the processes involved in their structural organization and function.In this work, we show involvement of the mechanotransduction pathway RhoA/ROCK in the structural reorganization of hPSC-derived cardiomyocytes after adhesion plating. These structural changes have a major impact on the intracellular localization of SERCA2 pumps and concurrent improvement in calcium cycling. The process is triggered by cell interaction with the culture substrate, which mechanical cues drive sarcomeric alignment and SERCA2a spreading and relocalization from a perinuclear to a whole-cell distribution. This structural reorganization is mediated by the mechanical properties of the substrate, as shown by the process failure in hPSC-CMs cultured on soft 4\u00a0kPa hydrogels as opposed to physiologically stiff 16\u00a0kPa hydrogels and glass. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) by different compounds identifies this specific signaling pathway as a major player in SERCA2 localization and the associated improvement in hPSC-CMs calcium handling ability in vitro.",

Genomic studies reveal genome-wide reduction of paused Pol II caused by mutant SPT5 and further identify a tight correlation between pausing-mediated transcription effect and local chromatin environment. Functionally, this pausing-deficient SPT5 disrupts ESC differentiation upon removal of self-renewal signals. Thus, our study uncovers an important role of Pol II pausing in regulating ESC differentiation and suggests a model that Pol II pausing coordinates with epigenetic modification to influence transcription during mESC differentiation.",

Previously reported stepwise acquisition of a spontaneous neoplastic phenotype during three-year continuous culture of telomerized cells (hBMSC-TERT20) didn't alter a diploid karyotype measured by spectral karyotype analysis (SKY).

We here used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to more stringently compare non-tumorigenic parental hBMSC-TERT strains with their tumorigenic subcloned populations. Confirmation of a known chromosome 9p21 microdeletion at locus CDKN2A/B, showed it also impinged upon the adjacent MTAP gene. Compared to reference diploid human fibroblast genomic DNA, the non-tumorigenic hBMSC-TERT4 cells had a copy number variation (CNV) in at least 14 independent loci.

Murine PSCs were prone to neuronal differentiation in embryoid body like culture with minimal medium conditions, based on the intrinsic default of PSCs to develop into cortical progenitors. Differences between Foxg1 wildtype (Foxg1WT) and knockout (Foxg1KO) mPSCs were analyzed.Several mPSC lines with homozygous mutations in Foxg1 were produced using the CRISPR/Cas9 system leading to loss of functional domains. Analysis of mRNA expression using quantitative Real-Time (q) PCR revealed that Foxg1KO mPSCs expressed significantly less mRNA of Foxg1, Emx1, and VGlut1 compared to Foxg1WT controls, indicating reduced differentiation towards dorsal telencephalic progenitors. However, the size of the derived EB-like structures did not differ between Foxg1WT and Foxg1KO mPSCs.These results show that loss of dorsal telencephalic progenitors can be detected using a simple and rapid differentiation protocol.

In this work, we have used a lung model of epithelial regeneration to investigate whether AhR regulates proper tissue repair by adjusting the expansion of undifferentiated stem-like cells. AhR-null mice developed a faster and more efficient repair of the lung bronchiolar epithelium upon naphthalene injury that required increased cell proliferation and the earlier activation of stem-like Clara, Basal and neuroepithelial cells precursors. Increased basal content in multipotent Sca1+/CD31\u2212/CD4\u2212 cells and in cells expressing pluripotency factors NANOG and OCT4 could also improve re-epithelialization in AhR-null lungs. The reduced response of AhR-deficient lungs to Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) repression shortly after injury may also help their improved bronchiolar epithelium repair.

Applying the MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins in mouse iPSC generation leads to shorter reprogramming dynamics, with earlier activation of pluripotent markers in reprogrammed cells than wild type OCT4 (wt-OCT4). Dramatic enhancement of iPSC colony induction efficiency and shortened reprogramming dynamics were observed when these MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion proteins were used to reprogram primary human cells.

We further show that the MYC Box I (MBI) is dispensable while both MBII and the linking region between MBI/II are essential for the enhanced reprogramming activity of MYC-TAD-OCT4 fusion protein. Consistent with an enhanced transcription activity, the engineered OCT4 significantly stimulated the expression of genes specifically targeted by OCT4-alone, OCT4/SOX2, and OCT4/SOX2/KLF4 during human iPSC induction, compared with the wt-OCT4.

Neural differentiation was analysed at the protein level qualitatively by immunocytochemistry and quantitatively by flow cytometry for NPC (SOX1, PAX6, NESTIN), neuronal (MAP2, TUBB3), cortical layer (TBR1, CUX1) and glial markers (SOX9, GFAP, AQP4). Electron microscopy demonstrated that both methods resulted in morphologically similar neural rosettes. However, quantification of NPCs derived from 3D neural induction exhibited an increase in the number of PAX6/NESTIN double positive cells and the derived neurons exhibited longer neurites. In contrast, 2D neural induction resulted in more SOX1 positive cells. While 2D monolayer induction resulted in slightly less mature neurons, at an early stage of differentiation, the patch clamp analysis failed to reveal any significant differences between the electrophysiological properties between the two induction methods. In conclusion, 3D neural induction increases the yield of PAX6+/NESTIN+ cells and gives rise to neurons with longer neurites, which might be an advantage for the production of forebrain cortical neurons, highlighting the potential of 3D neural induction, independent of iPSCs' genetic background.",

     "abstract": "Gravity plays an important role in normal tissue maintenance. The ability of stem cells to repair tissue loss in space through regeneration and differentiation remains largely unknown. To investigate the impact of microgravity on blood vessel formation from pluripotent stem cells, we employed the embryoid body (EB) model for vasculogenesis and simulated microgravity by clinorotation. We first differentiated mouse embryonic stem cells into cystic EBs containing two germ layers and then analyzed vessel formation under clinorotation. We observed that endothelial cell differentiation was slightly reduced under clinorotation, whereas vascular branch morphogenesis was markedly enhanced. EB-derived endothelial cells migrated faster, displayed multiple cellular processes, and had higher Cdc42 and Rac1 activity when subjected to clinorotation. Genetic analysis and rescue experiments demonstrated that Cdc42 but not Rac1 is required for microgravity-induced vascular branch morphogenesis. Furthermore, affinity pull-down assay and mass spectrometry identified Rap1GDS1 to be a Cdc42 guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which was upregulated by clinorotation. shRNA-mediated knockdown of Rap1GDS1 selectively suppressed Cdc42 activation and inhibited both baseline and microgravity-induced vasculogenesis. This was rescued by ectopic expression of constitutively active Cdc42. Taken together, these results support the notion that simulated microgravity activates Cdc42 via Rap1GDS1 to promote vascular branch morphogenesis.",

Recently we demonstrated that human (h) UC-MSCs, double labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles and Hoechst-33258 and transplanted intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into SOD1G93A transgenic mice, partially migrated into the spinal cord after a single injection. This prompted us to assess the effect of repeated ICV injections of hUC-MSCs on disease progression in SOD1G93A mice. Although no transplanted cells migrated to the spinal cord, a partial but significant protection of motor neurons (MNs) was found in the lumbar spinal cord of hUC-MSCs-treated SOD1G93A mice, accompanied by a shift from a pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2) to anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) and neuroprotective (IGF-1) environment in the lumbar spinal cord, probably linked to the activation of p-Akt survival pathway in both motor neurons and reactive astrocytes. However, this treatment neither prevented the muscle denervation nor delayed the disease progression of mice, emphasizing the growing evidence that protecting the motor neuron perikarya is not sufficient to delay the ALS progression.",

We observed that translational regulation during the differentiation of human adipose-derived stromal cells (hASCs, also known as adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells), a subset of which are stem cells, to adipocytes was a major regulatory event. hASCs showed a significant reduction of whole protein synthesis after adipogenic induction and a downregulation of the expression and translational efficiency of ribosomal proteins. Additionally, focal adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins were downregulated at the translational level. This negative regulation of the essential biological functions of hASCs resulted in a reduction in cell size and the potential of hASCs to migrate.We analyzed whether the inactivation of key translation initiation factors was involved in this observed major repression of translation. We showed that there was an increase in the hypo phosphorylated forms of 4E-BP1, a negative regulator of translation, during early adipogenesis.

Recently, it has been reported that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) derived from umbilical cord blood (CB) or adult peripheral blood (PB) afford a practical and efficient cellular substrate for iPSC generation. However, differences between EPCs from different blood sources have rarely been studied. In the current study, we derived EPCs from blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) and reprogrammed EPCs into iPSCs. We also explored differences between CB-EPCs and PB-EPCs at the molecular and cellular levels through a combination of transcriptomic analysis and cell biology techniques. EPC colonies in CB-MNCs emerged 5\u20137\u00a0days earlier, were 3-fold higher in number, and consistently larger in size than in PB-MNCs. Similarly, iPSC colonies generated from CB-EPCs was 2.5-fold higher in number than from PB-EPCs, indicating CB-EPCs have a higher reprogramming efficiency than PB-EPCs. Transcriptomic analysis using microarrays found a total of 1133 genes differentially expressed in CB-EPCs compared with PB-EPCs, with 675 genes upregulated and 458 downregulated. Several canonical pathways were impacted, among which the human embryonic stem cell pluripotency pathway was of particular interest. The differences in the gene expression pattern between CB-EPCs and PB-EPCs provide a molecular basis for the discrepancies seen in their derivation and reprogramming efficiencies, and highlight the advantages of using CB as the cellular source for the generation of iPSCs and their derivative tissues for ethnic-related toxicological applications.",

Currently, most MSC for clinical usage are derived from younger donors, due to ease of procurement and to the superior immune modulatory activity. However, the use of MSC from multiple unrelated donors makes it difficult to standardize study results and compare outcomes between different clinical trials. One solution is the use of MSC derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC); as iPSC-derived MSC have nearly unlimited proliferative potential and exhibit in vitro phenotypic stability. Given the value of dogs as a spontaneous disease model for pre-clinical evaluation of stem cell therapeutics, we investigated the functional properties of canine iPSC-derived MSC (iMSC), including immune modulatory properties and potential for teratoma formation. We found that canine iMSC downregulated expression of pluripotency genes and appeared morphologically similar to conventional MSC. Importantly, iMSC retained a stable phenotype after multiple passages, did not form teratomas in immune deficient mice, and did not induce tumor formation in dogs following systemic injection. We concluded therefore that iMSC were phenotypically stable, immunologically potent, safe with respect to tumor formation, and represented an important new source of cells for therapeutic modulation of inflammatory disorders.",

Comparison of cardiac clusters by MEA showed that ajmaline lengthened activation-recovery interval consistently across all lines.We conclude that ajmaline can block both depolarisation and repolarisation of hiPSC-CMs at the cellular level, but that a more refined integrated tissue model may be necessary to elicit differences in its effect between BrS patients and controls.",

Therefore, PPCs have great potential to serve as an alternative cell source for cell therapy, and the identification of compounds that facilitate PPC proliferation could provide stable and large-scale pancreatic cell preparation systems in clinical settings. Here, we developed and performed cell-based screens to identify small molecules that induce the proliferation of hiPSC-derived PDX1-expressing PPCs. The screening identified AT7867, which promoted PPC proliferation approximately five-fold within six days through the maintenance of a high Ki67+ cell ratio. The induced proliferation by AT7867 does not result in DNA damage, as revealed by pHH2AX staining, and is observed specifically in PPCs but not other cell types.

We have previously shown that physical cell compaction of dental mesenchyme cells during mesenchymal condensation is responsible for triggering odontogenic differentiation during embryogenesis, and that expression of Collagen VI stabilizes this induction. In addition, we have shown that synthetic polymer scaffolds that artificially induce cell compaction can induce embryonic mandible mesenchymal cells to initiate tooth differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. As embryonic cells would be difficult to use for regenerative medicine applications, here we explored whether compressive scaffolds coated with Collagen VI can be used to induce adult bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) to undergo an odontogenic lineage switch. These studies revealed that when mouse BMSCs are compressed using these scaffolds they increase expression of critical markers of tooth differentiation in vitro, including the key transcription factors Pax9 and Msx1. Implantation under the kidney capsule of contracting scaffolds bearing these cells in mice also resulted in local mineralization, calcification and production of dentin-like tissue. These findings show that these chemically-primed compressive scaffolds can be used to induce adult BMSCs to undergo a lineage switch and begin to form dentin-like tissue, thus raising the possibility of using adult BMSCs for future tooth regeneration applications.",

BMSC differentiation is also influenced by mechanical strain-related activation of ERK1/2 and AP-1, but the role of EGFR signaling in mechanotransduction is unclear. We investigated the effects of EGFR signaling in telomerase-immortalized BMSC, transfected with a luciferase reporter, comprising a mechanoresponsive AP1 element, using ligands, neutralizing antibodies and EGFR inhibitors on mechanotransduction and we found that EGF via EGFR increased the response to mechanical strain. Results were confirmed by qPCR analysis of mechanoresponsive genes. EGF-responsive interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 were synergistically enhanced by EGF stimulation and mechanical strain. We show here in immortalized and primary BMSC that EGFR signaling enhances mechanotransduction, indicating that the EGF system is a mechanosensitizer in BMSC.

     "abstract": "Rabbit induced pluripotent stem cells (rbiPSCs) possess the characteristic features of primed pluripotency as defined in rodents and primates. In the present study, we reprogrammed rbiPSCs using human Kr\u00fcppel-like factors (KLFs) 2 and 4 and cultured them in a medium supplemented with fetal calf serum and leukemia inhibitory factor. These cells (designated rbEKA) were propagated by enzymatic dissociation for at least 30 passages, during which they maintained a normal karyotype. This new culturing protocol resulted in transcriptional and epigenetic reconfiguration, as substantiated by the expression of transcription factors and the presence of histone modifications associated with na\u00efve pluripotency. Furthermore, microarray analysis of rbiPSCs, rbEKA cells, rabbit ICM cells, and rabbit epiblast showed that the global gene expression profile of the reprogrammed rbiPSCs was more similar to that of rabbit ICM and epiblast cells. Injection of rbEKA cells into 8-cell stage rabbit embryos resulted in extensive colonization of ICM in 9% early-blastocysts (E3.5), epiblast in 10% mid-blastocysts (E4.5), and embryonic disk in 1.4% pre-gastrulae (E6). Thus, these results indicate that KLF2 and KLF4 triggered the conversion of rbiPSCs into epiblast-like, embryo colonization-competent PSCs. Our results highlight some of the requirements to achieve bona fide chimeric competency.",

We showed that laminin substrates containing the \u03b15-chain are important for neuronal attachment, viability and network formation, as detected by phase contrast imaging, viability staining, and immunocytochemistry. Gene expression analysis showed that the molecular mechanisms involved in the preference of hPSC-derived neurons for specific laminin isoforms could be related to ECM remodeling and cell adhesion. Importantly, the microelectrode array analysis revealed the widest distribution of electrophysiologically active neurons on laminin \u03b15 substrates, indicating most efficient development of neuronal network functionality. This study shows that specific laminin \u03b15 substrates provide a controlled in vitro culture environment for hPSC-derived neurons.

Here we propose that the process of migration plays an additional role in quality control, by eliminating PGCs incapable of completing migration as well as through mechanisms that favor PGCs capable of responding appropriately to migration cues. Focusing on PGCs in mice, we explore evidence for a selective capacity of migration, considering the tandem regulation of proliferation and migration, cell-intrinsic and extrinsic control, the potential for tumors derived from failed PGC migrants, the potential mechanisms by which migratory PGCs vary in their cellular behaviors, and corresponding effects on development. We discuss the implications of a selective role of PGC migration for in vitro gametogenesis.",

Dmrt1 has notably diverse functions that include repressing pluripotency genes and promoting mitotic arrest in embryonic germ cells, reactivating prospermatogonia perinatally, establishing and maintaining spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs), promoting spermatogonial differentiation, and controlling the mitosis/meiosis switch. Dmrt6 acts in differentiating spermatogonia to coordinate an orderly exit from the mitotic/spermatogonial program and allow proper timing of entry to the meiotic/spermatocyte program. Finally, Dmrt7 takes over during the first meiotic prophase to help choreograph a transition in histone modifications that maintains transcriptional silencing of the sex chromosomes.

We previously reported that a replication-defective and persistent Sendai virus (SeVdp) vector harboring four reprogramming factors (SeVdp-iPS) can efficiently induce generation of transgene-free iPSCs. This vector can express all four factors stably and simultaneously without chromosomal integration and can be eliminated completely from reprogrammed cells by suppressing vector-derived RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Here, we describe an improved SeVdp-iPS vector (SeVdp(KOSM)302L) that is automatically erased in response to microRNA-302 (miR-302), uniquely expressed in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs). Gene expression and genome replication of the SeVdp-302L vector, which contains miRNA-302a target sequences at the 3\u2032 untranslated region of L mRNA, are strongly suppressed in PSCs. Consequently, SeVdp(KOSM)302L induces expression of reprogramming factors in somatic cells, while it is automatically erased from cells successfully reprogrammed to express miR-302. As this vector can reprogram somatic cells into transgene-free iPSCs without the aid of exogenous short interfering RNA (siRNA), the results we present here demonstrate that this vector may become an invaluable tool for the generation of human iPSCs for future clinical applications.",

     "abstract": "The ability of iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) to generate any cell type in the body makes them valuable tools for cell replacement therapies. However, differentiation of iPSCs can be demanding, slow and variable. During differentiation chromatin is re-organized and silent dense heterochromatin becomes tethered to the nuclear periphery by processes involving the nuclear lamina and proteins of the INM (inner nuclear membrane). The INM protein, Samp1 (Spindle Associated Membrane Protein 1) interacts with Lamin A/C and the INM protein Emerin, which has a chromatin binding LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1)-domain. In this paper we investigate if Samp1 can play a role in the differentiation of iPSCs. Samp1 levels increased as differentiating iPSCs started to express Lamin A/C. Interestingly, even under pluripotent culturing conditions, ectopic expression of Samp1 induced a rapid differentiation of iPSCs, of which some expressed the neuronal marker \u03b2III-tubulin already after 6\u00a0days. This suggests that Samp1 is involved in early differentiation of iPSCs and could potentially be explored as a tool to promote progression of the differentiation process.",

Because a non-integrating approach would be preferable to eliminate or minimize the risk associated with random genomic integration, here we investigate whether transient expression of PAX7 using minicircle DNA would enable the generation of functional pluripotent stem cell-derived myogenic progenitors, equivalent to those generated by lentivirus. Our results demonstrate that upon multiple transfections, the minicircle approach allows for the scalable generation of myogenic progenitors and these undergo efficient terminal differentiation in vitro. However, transplantation of minicircle-generated myogenic progenitors resulted in limited engraftment. This is probably due to less efficient delivery and more transient PAX7 expression in these cultures since PAX7 downregulation is accompanied by high level of spontaneous differentiation. Thus, although the in vitro data shows that the minicircle approach could potentially replace the use of lentivirus, improvements in the transfection/expression system will be necessary before it will be a feasible strategy for the generation of myogenic progenitors for cell replacement therapy.",

We show that conditional Ronin knockout sensitizes embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to UV-C-induced DNA damage in association with Atr pathway activation and G2/M arrest. Ronin binds to and regulates the genes encoding several DNA repair factors, including Gtf2h4 and Rad18, providing a potential mechanism for this phenotype.

However, the effects of such inhibition on PSCs, besides upregulating the Wnt pathway, have rarely been investigated despite that GSK3 is broadly involved in other cellular activities such as insulin signaling and cell growth/survival regulation. Here we describe a previously unknown synergistic effect between GSK3 inhibition (e.g., Chir99021 and LY2090314) and various normally non-toxic thiol-containing antioxidants (e.g., N-acetylcysteine, NAC) on the induction of apoptosis in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Neither Chir99021 nor the antioxidants individually induced significant apoptosis, whereas their combined treatment resulted in rapid and extensive apoptosis, with substantial caspase 3 activity observed within 3\u00a0h and over 90% decrease in cell viability after 24\u00a0h. We confirmed the generality of this phenomenon with multiple independent iPSCs lines, various thiol-based antioxidants and distinct GSK3 inhibitors. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that rapamycin treatment could substantially reduce cell death, suggesting the critical role of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Akt dysregulation was also found to partially contribute to cell apoptosis but was not the primary cause. Further, this coordinated proapoptotic effect was not detected in mouse ESCs but was present in another human cells line: a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231).Given the wide use of GSK3 inhibition in biomedical research: from iPSC differentiation to cancer intervention and the treatment of neuronal diseases, researchers can potentially take advantage of or avoid this synergistic effect for improved experimental or clinical outcome.",

Addition of ATP to culture medium prolonged dynamic blebbing and inhibited attachment. Inhibition of P2X7 by specific drugs or by siRNA significantly reduced dynamic blebbing and improved cell attachment.

Calcium influx was observed using Fura-4 when ATP was added to culture medium and inhibited in the presence of the P2X7 inhibitor. Over-expressing activated Rac in hESC reduced blebbing and promoted cell attachment, while a Rac inhibitor prolonged blebbing and reduced attachment. These data identify a pathway involving P2X7 that initiates and prolongs dynamic blebbing during hESC passaging.

Recent advances in protocol development and mechanism dissections have made direct induction of neuronal cells from other somatic cells (iN) a promising strategy for such purposes. In this study, we established a protocol to expand a population of fibroblast-like cells from adult human retinal tissues, which can be reprogrammed into iNs by forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors. Interestingly, the combination of Ascl1, Brn2, Myt1l, and NeuroD1 transcription factors, which has been demonstrated to be sufficient to reprogram human embryonic and dermal fibroblasts into iNs, failed to reprogram the fibroblast-like cells from human retinas into iNs. Instead, supplementing Ascl1 with Pax6 sufficed to convert the cells into iNs, which exhibited a typical neuronal morphology, expressed neural marker genes, displayed active and passive neuronal membrane activities, and made synaptic communications with other neurons. Moreover, iNs converted from retina-derived fibroblast-like cells contained high ratios of \u03b3-Aminobutyric acid- (GABA-) and tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH-) positive neurons. Thus, the present study proposes a protocol that makes use of discarded retinal tissues from eye banks for iN generation, and suggests that different sources of somatic cells require different iN induction recipes and may also affect the iN subtype outputs. Our study may also facilitate the future development of methods to convert resident cells in situ into retinal neurons for treating retinal degeneration disease purpose.",

Gene expression and flow cytometry confirmed the pluripotent and cardiomyocyte phenotype of undifferentiated and differentiated hiPSCs, respectively. Although reduction of CXCR4 and CXCR7 expression resulted in a delayed cardiac phenotype, only knockdown of CXCR4 delayed the spontaneous beating of hiPSC-CMs. Knockdown of CXCR4 and CXCR7 differentially altered calcium transients and \u03b2-adrenergic response in hiPSC-CMs. In engineered cardiac tissues, depletion of CXCR4 or CXCR7 had opposing effects on developed force and chronotropic response to \u03b2-agonists. This work demonstrates distinct roles for the SDF-1/CXCR4 or CXCR7 network in hiPSC-derived ventricular cardiomyocyte specification, maturation and function.",

Although the specific function of Sca-1 remains unknown, Sca-1 seems to play a role in proliferation, differentiation and cell migration in a number of tissues. In the skin epithelium, Sca-1 is highly expressed in the interfollicular epidermis but is absent in most compartments of the hair follicle; however, the function of Sca-1 in the skin has not been investigated. To explore the role of Sca-1 in normal and malignant skin development we generated transgenic mice that express Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells that are normally Sca-1 negative. Development of hair follicles and interfollicular epidermis appeared normal in Sca-1 mutant mice; however, follicular induction of Sca-1 expression in bulge region and isthmus stem cells reduced the overall yield of papillomas in a chemical carcinogenesis protocol. Despite that fewer papillomas developed in transgenic mice a higher proportion of the papillomas underwent malignant conversion. These findings suggest that overexpression of Sca-1 in the hair follicle stem cells contributes at different stages of tumour development. In early stages, overexpression of Sca-1 decreases tumour formation while at later stages overexpression of Sca-1 seems to drive tumours towards malignant progression.",

     "abstract": "Closed head injury (CHI) usually results in severe and permanent neurological impairments, which are caused by several intertwined phenomena, such as cerebral edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, neuronal loss, astroglial scarring and inflammation. We previously reported that induced neural stem cells (iNSCs), similar to neural stem cells (NSCs), can accelerate neurological recovery in vivo and produce neurotrophic factors in vitro. However, the effects of iNSC neurotrophy following CHI were not determined. Moreover, whether iNSCs have immunomodulatory properties is unknown. Mouse models of CHI were established using a standardized weight-drop device and assessed by neurological severity score (NSS). Although these models fail to mimic the complete spectrum of human CHI, they reproduce impairment in neurological function observed in clinical patients. Syngeneic iNSCs or NSCs were separately transplanted into the brains of CHI mice at 12\u00a0h after CHI. Neurological impairment post-CHI was evaluated by several tests. Animals were sacrificed for morphological and molecular biological analyses. We discovered that iNSC administration promoted neurological functional recovery in CHI mice and reduced cerebral edema, BBB disruption, cell death and astroglial scarring following trauma. Implanted iNSCs could up-regulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) levels to support the survival of existing neurons after CHI. In addition, engrafted iNSCs decreased immune cell recruitment and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in the brain post-injury. Moreover, we found significant nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-\u03baB) inhibition in the presence of iNSC grafts. In short, iNSCs exert neurotrophic and immunomodulatory effects that mitigate CHI-induced neurological impairment.",

     "abstract": "The birth of new neurons, or neurogenesis, in the adult midbrain is important for progressing dopamine cell-replacement therapies for Parkinson's disease. Most studies suggest newborn cells remain undifferentiated or differentiate into glia within the adult midbrain. However, some studies suggest nestin\u00a0+\u00a0neural precursor cells (NPCs) have a propensity to generate new neurons here. We sought to confirm this by administering tamoxifen to adult NesCreERT2/R26eYFP transgenic mice, which permanently labelled adult nestin-expressing cells and their progeny with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP). eYFP\u00a0+ midbrain cells were then characterized 1\u201332\u00a0weeks later in acutely prepared brain slices using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology combined with single-cell RT-qPCR. Most eYFP\u00a0+ cells exhibited a mature neuronal phenotype with large amplitude fast action potentials (APs), spontaneous post-synaptic currents (sPSCs), and expression of \u2018mature\u2019 neuronal genes (NeuN, Gad1, Gad2 and/or VGLUT2). This was the case even at the earliest time-point following tamoxifen (i.e. 1\u00a0week). In comparison to neighboring eYFP\u00a0\u2212 (control) cells, eYFP\u00a0+ cells discharged more APs per unit current injection, and had faster AP time-to-peak, hyperpolarized resting membrane potential, smaller membrane capacitance and shorter duration sPSCs. eYFP\u00a0+ cells were also differentiated from eYFP\u00a0\u2212 cells by increased expression of \u2018immature\u2019 pro-neuronal genes (Pax6, Ngn2 and/or Msx1). However, further analyses failed to reveal evidence of a place of birth, neuronal differentiation, maturation and integration indicative of classical neurogenesis. Thus our findings do not support the notion that nestin\u00a0+\u00a0NPCs in the adult SNc and midbrain generate new neurons via classical neurogenesis. Rather, they raise the possibility that mature neurons express nestin under unknown circumstances, and that this is associated with altered physiology and gene expression.",

Priming events, such as erasure of DNA methylation and chromatin remodeling determines the success of pluripotency acquisition later. Therefore, growing efforts are made to understand epigenetic regulatory network that makes reprogramming possible and efficient. Here, we analyze the role of transcriptional corepressor TRIM28, involved in heterochromatin formation, during the process of reprogramming of mouse somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells). We demonstrate that Trim28 knockdown (Trim28 KD) causes that emerging iPS cells differentiate immediately back into MEFs therefore they fail to yield stable iPS cell colonies. To better comprehend the mechanism of TRIM28 action in reprogramming, we performed a reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) using in excess of 300 different antibodies and compared the proteomic profiles of wild-type and Trim28 KD cells during reprogramming. We revealed the differences in the dynamics of reprogramming of wild-type and Trim28 KD cells. Interestingly, proteomic profile of Trim28 KD cells at the final stage of reprogramming resembled differentiated state rather than maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal, strongly suggesting spontaneous differentiation of Trim28 KD cells back to their parental cell type. We also observed that action of TRIM28 in reprogramming is accompanied by differential enrichment of proteins involved in cell cycle, adhesion and stemness. Collectively, these results suggest that regulation of epigenetic modifications coordinated by TRIM28 plays a crucial role in reprogramming process.",

This test identified three main SVF cell populations: ~\u00a050% cs-DLK1\u2212/cs-CD34+/cs-CD146\u2212 ASCs, ~\u00a07.5% cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34dim/+/cs-CD146+ and ~\u00a07.5% cs-DLK1+/cs-CD34dim/+/cs-CD146\u2212 cells. All cells contained intracellular CD146. Whole mount fluorescent IHC staining of small vessels detected CD146+ endothelial cells (CD31+/CD34+/CD146+) and pericytes (CD31\u2212/CD34\u2212/CD146+ ASCs). The cells in the outer adventitial layer showed the typical ASC morphology, were strongly CD34+ and contained low amounts of intracellular CD146 protein (CD31\u2212/CD34+/CD146+). Additionally, we detected wavy CD34\u2212/CD146+ and CD34dim/CD146+ cells. CD34dim/CD146+ cells were slightly more bulky than CD34\u2212/CD146+ cells. Both CD34\u2212/CD146+ and CD34dim/CD146+ cells were detached from the inner pericyte layer and protruded into the outer adventitial layer. Cultured early passage ASCs contained low levels of CD146 mRNA, which was expressed in two different splicing variants, at a relatively high amount of the CD146-long form and at a relatively low amount of the CD146-short form. ASCs contained low levels of CD146 protein, which consisted predominantly long form and a small amount of short form. The CD146 protein was highly stable, and the majority of the protein was localized in the Golgi apparatus. In conclusion, the present study contributes to a better understanding of the spatial localization of CD34+/CD146+ and CD34\u2212/CD146+ cells in the adipose niche of sWAT and identifies CD146 as intracellular protein in cs-DLK1\u2212/cs-CD34+/cs-CD146\u2212 ASCs.",

In the present study, the effect of delta-opioid receptor (DOR) activation on human umbilical cord-blood borne fibroblasts (hUCB-BFs) survival under oxidative stress (H2O2) was evaluated. Oxidative stress which is known to trigger pathological conditions of the unfolded protein response (UPR) leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Upon its activation by D-Alanine 2, Leucine 5 Enkephaline (DADLE, selective DOR agonist) in hUCB-BFs under oxidative stress, a significant down regulation (~\u00a02 folds) of key UPR genes was observed as determined by qPCR, Thioflavin-T protein aggregation assay and western blot analysis. Concomitantly, the oxidative stress-mediated cell-death was ameliorated and the viable-cells' percentage was enhanced following DOR activation. The intracellular ROS production upon H2O2 treatment as determined by CM-H2DCFDA staining was repressed, the anti-apoptotic marker Bcl-2 was upregulated along with a significant suppression in the expression levels of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Bad upon DOR activation. Upon subsequent treatment with naltrindole, the effects of DADLE-induced cytoprotection were reverted significantly. These results propound the role of DADLE-mediated DOR-activation on improvement of the viability, which might succour successful hUCB-BFs transplants and greatly absolve the inefficacy of tissue-specific engineered transplants.",

One potential source of stem cells for new regenerative medicine-based therapeutic approaches for spinal cord injury repair is neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). To this aim, we extracted CSF from the cyst surrounding the exposed neural placode during the surgical repair of myelomeningocele in 6 fetuses (20 to 26\u00a0weeks of gestation). In primary cultured CSF-derived cells, neurogenic properties were confirmed by in vitro differentiation into various neural lineage cell types, and NPC markers expression (TBR2, CD15, SOX2) were detected by immunofluorescence and RT-PCR analysis. Differentiation into three neural lineages was corroborated by arbitrary differentiation (depletion of growths factors) or explicit differentiation as neuronal, astrocyte, or oligodendrocyte cell types using specific induction mediums. Differentiated cells showed the specific expression of neural differentiation markers (\u03b2III-tubulin, GFAP, CNPase, oligo-O1). In myelomeningocele patients, CSF-derived cells could become a potential source of NPCs with neurogenic capacity. Our findings support the development of innovative stem-cell-based therapeutics by autologous transplantation of CSF-derived NPCs in damaged spinal cords, such as myelomeningocele, thus promoting neural tissue regeneration in fetuses.",

Supportively, spliceosomal components involved in the catalytically active pre-mRNA splicing step were mainly co-localized with hPS spliceosomes. By profiling the gene expression of 342 selected splicing factors, we found that 71 genes were significantly altered during the reprogramming of human somatic cells into hiPSs. Among them, SNRPA1, SNRPD1, and PNN were significantly up-regulated during the early stage of reprogramming, identified as hub genes by interaction network and cluster analysis. SNRPA1, SNRPD1, or PNN depletion led to a pronounced loss of pluripotency and significantly blocked hiPS generation. SNRPA1, SNRPD1, and PNN co-localized with the hPS spliceosomes, physically interacted with each other, and positively influenced the appearance of hPS spliceosomes.

CXCL12, a chemokine secreted after brain injury, reaches the SVZ in a gradient manner and drives neuroblasts towards the lesion area.

The NSC death induced by CXCL12(5-67) involves caspases 9 and 3/7 activation, implying the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in this phenomenon.

To better understand the role of VEGFA and SEMA3A in leukemogenesis, we recruited 30 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients, 29 acute myeloid leukemia (6 secondary to MDS) patients and 12 controls. We found higher VEGFA expression in de novo AML patients (without prior MDS) group (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0073) and higher SEMA3A expression in all BMSCs patient's samples compared to control group. We then overexpressed VEGFA in an acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, KG1 cells, and in normal CD34+ cells. This overexpression increased KG1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.045) and CD34+ cell (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042) viability and KG1 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.042) and CD34+ cell (p\u00a0=\u00a00.047) proliferation. Moreover, KG1 and CD34+ cells overexpressing VEGFA also had increased proliferation when co-cultured with human marrow stromal HS5 cells (p\u00a0=\u00a00.045 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.02, respectively).

Co-culture of KG1 transformed cells with HS27 cells overexpressing SEMA3A reduced KG1 proliferation as well (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). To investigate whether the dominant SEMA3A effect over VEGFA could be due to competition for neuropilin1 receptor (NRP1), we performed immunoprecipitation with anti-NRP1 antibody of cell extracts of co-cultured KG1 and HS5 cells, induced or not by VEGFA and SEMA3A recombinant proteins. Results showed a preferential association of NRP1 with SEMA3A, suggesting that SEMA3A can partially reverse the effects caused by the VEGFA preventing its binding with the NRP1 receptor. Since both hematopoietic cells, leukemic and normal, showed similar behavior, we suppose that the attempt to reversion of VEGF effects by SEMA3A is a homeostatic phenomenon in the hematopoietic niche. Finally, we conclude that VEGFA overexpression confers AML cell advantages and SEMA3A may partially reverse this effect; thus, SEMA3A protein combined with VEGFA inhibitors could be beneficial for AML treatment.",

To determine the utility of these neurons in investigating the effects of neurotoxic chemotherapy, we measured morphological differences in neurite outgrowth, cell viability as determined by ATP levels and apoptosis through measures of caspase 3/7 activation following treatment with clinically relevant concentrations of platinating agents (cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin), taxanes (paclitaxel, docetaxel and nab-paclitaxel), a targeted proteasome inhibitor (bortezomib), an antiangiogenic compound (thalidomide), and 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic that does not cause neuropathy.

Previously, we had constructed monoclonal antibodies against the undifferentiated cell-specific surface markers of human dental pulp cells (hDPCs) by performing decoy immunization. Among them, a monoclonal antibody against the cell surface antigen of the undifferentiated hDPCs (named UPSA-1) was purified and its heavy and light chain consensus regions were analyzed. The cell surface binding affinity of UPSA-1 mAb on the undifferentiated hDPCs was stronger than that on the differentiated cells. When tunicamycin was applied to hDPSCs during culture, the cell surface binding affinity of the antibody was dramatically decreased, and dentinogenic differentiation was reduced.

However, its connection to tumor-initiating cells (TICs) remains unknown. In this study, we report that HLA-I is down-regulated in a subpopulation of cells that have high tumor initiating capacity in different types of human sarcomas. Detailed characterization revealed their distinct molecular profiles regarding proliferation, apoptosis and stemness programs. Notably, these TICs can be induced to differentiate along distinct mesenchymal lineages, including the osteogenic pathway. The retinoic acid receptor signaling pathway is overexpressed in HLA-1 negative TICs. All-trans retinoic acid treatment successfully induced osteogenic differentiation of this subpopulation, in vitro and in vivo, resulting in significantly decreased tumor formation. Thus, our findings indicate down-regulated HLA-I is a shared feature of TICs in a variety of human sarcomas, and differentiation therapy strategies may specifically target undifferentiated TICs and inhibit tumor formation.",

However, little is known about the specific role of NPY in the proliferation and apoptosis of bone marrow stromal cells (also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, BMSCs), which contain a subpopulation of multipotent skeletal stem cells. Based on BrdU incorporation tests, Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, we showed that NPY significantly promoted the proliferation of BMSCs in a concentration-dependent manner, with a maximal effect observed at a concentration of 10\u2212\u00a010\u00a0M for pro-proliferative and 10\u2212\u00a012\u00a0M for anti-apoptotic activities. Furthermore, NPY significantly increased the percentage of cells in S and G2/M phases. In addition, NPY exhibited a protective effect after 24\u00a0h of serum starvation as illustrated by a reduction in the apoptosis rate, degree of nuclear condensation, and expression of apoptosis markers, including caspase-3, caspase-9 and Bax mRNA expression. NPY also increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of canonical Wnt signaling pathway proteins, including \u03b2-catenin and c-myc, during the induced proliferative and anti-apoptotic processes. However, the proliferative and anti-apoptotic activities of NPY were partially blocked by both PD160170 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) and DKK1 (0.2\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). These compounds also blocked the mRNA and protein expression of \u03b2-catenin, p-GSK-3\u03b2 and c-myc. Therefore, the results of the present study demonstrated that NPY exerts a proliferative and protective effect on BMSCs in a dose- and time-dependent manner in vitro, and importantly, these effects may be mediated via its Y1 receptor and involved in activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway.",

Platinum-based therapies have been extensively explored as a treatment for ACC, but they show little effectiveness. Studies have shown that a specific group of tumor cells, harboring characteristics of cancer stem cells (CSCs), are involved in chemoresistance of myeloid leukemias, breast, colorectal and pancreatic carcinomas. Therapeutic strategies that target CSCs improve the survival of patients by decreasing the rates of tumor relapse, and epigenetic drugs, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), have shown promising results in targeting CSCs. In this study, we investigated the effect of the HDACi Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (Vorinostat), and cisplatin, alone or in combination, on CSCs and non-CSCs from ACC. We used CSCs as a biological marker for tumor resistance to therapy in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples and ACC primary cells. We found that cisplatin reduced tumor viability, but enriched the population of CSCs. Systemic administration of Vorinostat reduced the number of detectable CSCs in vivo and in vitro, and a low dose of Vorinostat decreased tumor cell viability. However, the combination of Vorinostat and cisplatin was extremely effective in depleting CSCs and reducing tumor viability in all ACC primary cells by activating cellular senescence. These observations suggest that HDACi and intercalating agents act more efficiently in combination to destroy tumor cells and their stem cells.",

A single FGF2 transcript can be translated into five FGF2 protein isoforms, an 18\u00a0kDa low molecular weight (LMW) isoform and four larger high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms (Arese et al., 1999; Arnaud et al., 1999). As they are not generally secreted, high molecular weight (HMW) FGF2 isoforms have predominantly been investigated intracellularly; only a very limited number of studies have investigated their activity as extracellular factors. Here we report over-expression, isolation, and biological activity of all recombinant human FGF2 isoforms. We show that HMW FGF2 isoforms can support self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro. Exogenous supplementation with HMW FGF2 isoforms also activates the canonical FGFR/MAPK pathway and induces mitogenic activity in a manner similar to that of the 18\u00a0kDa FGF2 isoform. Though all HMW isoforms, when supplemented exogenously, are able to recapitulate LMW FGF2 activity to some degree, it appears that certain isoforms tend to do so more poorly, demonstrating a lesser functional response by several measures. A better understanding of isoform-specific FGF2 effects will lead to a better understanding of developmental and pathological FGF2 signaling.",

At 20% O2, the synthesis of HIF-1\u03b1 is balanced by its hydroxylation and proteasomal degradation. This favors HSPC differentiation, but can be prevented by culturing CD34\u00a0+ cord blood cells in the presence of dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG). This differentiation may also be reduced by culturing the cells in the presence of Stemregenin 1, an antagonist of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). The objective of this study was to investigate how hypoxia, DMOG and Stemregenin 1 might affect the expansion of HSPCs with the aim of identifying optimal conditions for expansion in culture. It was found that DMOG decreased proliferation but was effective in preserving the number of cells in the primitive hematopoietic sub-populations in vitro. The effect of DMOG was similar to hypoxia, although differences were observed with regard to the side population and CD34\u00a0+ sub-populations. Stemregenin 1 on the other hand increased the size of the primitive as well as the other HSC sub-populations. The use of Stemregenin 1 with DMOG increased the proportion of primitive HSCs to 3.54% compared to 2.61% for Stemregenin 1 alone. In vivo engraftment studies confirmed these findings and showed that fewer cells (3710) are required for long-term engraftment when HSCs are grown in Stemregenin 1 together with hypoxia than in Stemregenin 1 under conditions of normoxia (13430).",

It is generally accepted that CB-ECFCs are more clonogenic, proliferative and angiogenic than AB-ECFCs. Nevertheless, only a few studies have focused on the functional heterogeneity of CB-ECFCs from different individuals. Moreover, AB-ECFC loss of function is yet to be precisely described. We have focused on these two issues that are critical for clinical perspectives.The detailed clonogenic profile of CB-ECFCs and AB-ECFCs was obtained and revealed a high inter individual heterogeneity and the absence of correlation with age. Most CB-ECFCs yielded initial colonies and had functional properties similar to those of AB-ECFCs. Conversely, a high clonogenicity was associated with an enhanced proliferative and angiogenic potential and stemness gene overexpression, confirming that immaturity, lost by AB-ECFCs, was a prerequisite to functionality. We thus demonstrated the importance of selecting CB-ECFCs according to specific criteria, and we propose using the initial clonogenicity as a relevant marker of their potential efficacy on vascular repair.",

However, isolation of CSC from tumor tissue and their characterization are challenging due to uncertainty about their molecular markers and conditions for their propagation. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), which arises predominantly in the salivary glands, is a slow-growing but relentless tumor that frequently invades nerves and metastasizes. New effective treatment approaches for ACC have not emerged over the last 40\u00a0years. Previously, based on a highly conserved SOX10 gene signature that we identified in the majority of ACC tumors, we suggested the existence in ACC of SOX10+ cells with neural stem properties and corroborated this hypothesis via isolation from ACC tissue a novel population of CSC, termed ACC-CSC. These cells activated NOTCH1 signaling and co-expressed SOX10 and other ACC-intrinsic neural crest stem cell markers with CD133, a CSC cell surface marker, suggesting that ACC is driven by a previously uncharacterized population of SOX10+/CD133+ cells with neural stem cell properties. Here, we authenticated ACC identity of our primary cultures by demonstrating that most of them harbor MYB-NFIB fusions, which are found in 86% of ACC. We demonstrated using CyTOF, a novel mass cytometry technology, that these cells express high \u03b2-catenin and STAT3 levels and are marked by CD24 and CD44. Finally, to streamline development of ACC cell lines, we developed RT-PCR tests for distinguishing mouse and human cells and used immunomagnetic cell sorting to eliminate mouse cells from long-term cell cultures. Overall, this study describes a new population of CSC that activates signaling pathways associated with poor prognosis, validates their ACC identity, and optimizes approaches that can be used for purification of ACC-CSC and generation of cell lines.",

Using adult skin fibroblasts isolated from Mst1 knockout mice (Mst1\u2212/\u2212) as a source of iPSC we found that genetic ablation of Mst1 leads to significantly increased reprogramming efficiency by 43.8%. Moreover, Mst1\u2212/\u2212 iPSC displayed increase proliferation by 12% as well as an increase in cell viability by 20% when treated with a chemical hypoxic inducer.

To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying transcription factor-mediated reprogramming we have established a model, which allows for the efficient screening of whole libraries of miRNAs modulating the generation of iPSCs from murine embryonic fibroblasts. Applying this model, we identified 14 miRNAs effectively inhibiting iPSC generation, including miR-132 and miR-212. Intriguingly, repression of these miRNAs during iPSC generation also resulted in significantly increased reprogramming efficacy. MiRNA target evaluation by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and luciferase assays revealed two crucial epigenetic regulators, the histone acetyl transferase p300 as well as the H3K4 demethylase Jarid1a (KDM5a) to be directly targeted by both miRNAs. Moreover, we demonstrated that siRNA-mediated knockdown of either p300 or Jarid1a recapitulated the miRNA effects and led to a significant decrease in reprogramming efficiency.Thus, conducting a full library miRNA screen we here describe a miRNA family, which markedly reduces generation of iPSC and upon inhibition in turn enhances reprogramming. These miRNAs, at least in part, exert their functions through repression of the epigenetic modulators p300 and Jarid1a, highlighting these two molecules as an endogenous epigenetic roadblock during iPSC generation.",

Here we report on the successful outcome of this experience and work flow for banking and facilitating access to an otherwise disparate European resource, with lessons to benefit the international research community.The report focuses on the EBiSC experience of rapidly establishing an operational capacity to procure, bank and distribute a foundational collection of established hiPSC lines. It validates the feasibility and defines the challenges of harnessing and integrating the capability and productivity of centres across Europe using commonly available resources currently in the field.",

Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is well known as a tissue stem cell and progenitor marker, both of which are reported to be sensitive to reprogramming. In the present study, we examined the reprogramming behavior of Lgr5-expressing cells (Lgr5\u00a0+ cells). First, we compared reprogramming behavior using mouse Lgr5\u00a0+ and Lgr5 negative (Lgr5\u00a0\u2212) hair follicles (HFs). The number of alkaline phosphatase staining-positive cells was lesser in a well of Lgr5\u00a0+ HFs than in Lgr5\u00a0\u2212 HFs; however, the ratio of Nanog\u00a0+ SSEA1\u00a0+ cells in the cell mixture derived from Lgr5\u00a0+ HFs was much higher than that from Lgr5\u00a0\u2212 HFs. Lgr5\u00a0+ cells could be induced from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) after transduction with Yamanaka factors. As shown in HFs, the progeny of Lgr5\u00a0+ cells arising from MEFs highly converted into Nanog\u00a0+ cells and did not form Nanog\u00a0\u2212 colonies. The progeny represented the status of the late reprogramming phase to a higher degree than the nonprogeny. We also confirmed this using human Lg5\u00a0+ cells. Our findings suggest that the use of Lgr5\u00a0+ cells will minimize sorting efforts for obtaining superior iPSCs.",

     "abstract": "Understanding the regulatory networks underlying lineage differentiation and fate determination of human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSC) is a prerequisite for their therapeutic use. The goal of the current study was to unravel the novel role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 3 (LRP3) in regulating the osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of immortalized hBMSCs. Gene expression profiling revealed significantly higher LRP3 levels in the highly osteogenic hBMSC clone imCL1 than in the less osteogenic clone imCL2, as well as a significant upregulation of LRP3 during the osteogenic induction of the imCL1 clone. Data from functional and gene expression assays demonstrated the role of LRP3 as a molecular switch promoting hBMSC lineage differentiation into osteoblasts and inhibiting differentiation into adipocytes. Interestingly, microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling identified miR-4739 as the most under-represented miRNA (\u2212\u00a036.11 fold) in imCL1 compared to imCL2. The TargetScan prediction algorithm, combined with functional and biochemical assays, identified LRP3 mRNA as a novel target of miR-4739, with a single potential binding site for miR-4739 located in the LRP3 3\u2032 UTR. Regulation of LRP3 expression by miR-4739 was subsequently confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and luciferase assays. Over-expression of miR-4739 mimicked the effects of LRP3 knockdown on promoting adipogenic and suppressing osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs. Hence, we report for the first time a novel biological role for the LRP3/hsa-miR-4739 axis in balancing osteogenic and adipocytic differentiation of hBMSCs. Our data support the potential utilization of miRNA-based therapies in regenerative medicine.",

We also measured levels of key enzymes in the base excision repair (BER) pathway in each cell line before and after exposure to the mutagen. Our results confirm that pluripotent cells normally maintain lower frequencies of point mutations than differentiated cells, and show that differentiated cells exhibit a large increase in mutation frequency following a moderate mutagenic exposure, whereas pluripotent cells subjected to the same exposure show no increase in mutations. This result likely reflects the higher levels of BER proteins detectable in pluripotent cells prior to exposure and supports our thesis that maintenance of enhanced genetic integrity is a fundamental characteristic of pluripotent cells.",

Therefore, we evaluated miR-29 expression during reprogramming of fibroblasts transduced with lentiviral OKS and OKSM vectors and we show that addition of c-MYC to the reprogramming factor cocktail decreases miR-29 expression levels. Moreover, we found that transfection of pre-miR-29a strongly decreased OKS-induced formation of GFP+-colonies in MEF-cells from Oct4-eGFP reporter mouse, whereas anti-miR-29a showed the opposite effect. Furthermore, we studied components of two pathways which are important for reprogramming and which involve miR-29 targets: active DNA-demethylation and Wnt-signaling. We show that inhibition of Tet1, Tet2 and Tet3 as well as activation of Wnt-signaling leads to decreased reprogramming efficiency. Moreover, transfection of pre-miR-29 resulted in elevated expression of \u03b2-Catenin transcriptional target sFRP2 and increased TCF/LEF-promoter activity.

Among them, non-invasive approach to obtain source cells in a timely manner, safer integration-free delivery of reprogramming factors, and purification of NPCs before transplantation are top priorities to overcome. In this study, we developed a safe and cost-effective pipeline to generate clinically relevant NPCs. We first isolated cells from patients' urine and reprogrammed them into iPSCs by non-integrating Sendai viral vectors, and carried out experiments on neural differentiation. NPCs were purified by A2B5, an antibody specifically recognizing a glycoganglioside on the cell surface of neural lineage cells, via fluorescence activated cell sorting. Upon further in vitro induction, NPCs were able to give rise to neurons, oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. To test the functionality of the A2B5\u00a0+ NPCs, we grafted them into the contused mouse thoracic spinal cord. Eight weeks after transplantation, the grafted cells survived, integrated into the injured spinal cord, and differentiated into neurons and glia. Our specific focus on cell source, reprogramming, differentiation and purification method purposely addresses timing and safety issues of transplantation to SCI models. It is our belief that this work takes one step closer on using human iPSC derivatives to SCI clinical settings.",

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) was employed to fuse a 1:1 mixture of lentiviral vectors LV-MLC2v-GFP- or \u2013tdTomato-labeled hPSC-VCMs, such that hPSC-VCMs fused syncytia (FS) were identified as doubly GFP+/tdTomato+ multi-nucleated cells. These microscopically-identified FS were doubled in size as gauged by their capacitance when compared to the control mononucleated hPSC-VCMs using patch-clamp analysis. Reduced automaticity or action potential (AP) firing rate and moderately prolonged AP duration were observed in FS from day 6 post-fusion induction. However, Ca2+ handling, mitochondrial biogenesis and the extent of apoptosis were not significantly altered.

Although controversial, it is generally believed that dividing cells here remain undifferentiated or differentiate into glia, not neurons. However, there is a suggestion that Nestin-expressing neural precursor cells (NPCs) in the adult SNc have a propensity to differentiate into neurons, which we sought to confirm in the present study. Adult (>\u00a08-weeks old) transgenic NesCreERT2/GtROSA or NesCreERT2/R26eYFP mice were used to permanently label Nestin-expressing cells and their progeny with \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal) or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP), respectively. Most \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ or eYFP\u00a0+ cells were found in the ependymal lining of the midbrain aqueduct (Aq) and in the midline ventral to Aq. Smaller but significant numbers were in the periaqueductal gray (PAG), the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and in SNc. Low-level basal proliferation was evidenced by a modest increase in number of \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ or eYFP\u00a0+ cells over time, fewer \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ or eYFP\u00a0+ cells when mice were administered the anti-mitotic agent Cytarabine, and incorporation of the proliferation marker bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in a very small number of \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ cells. No evidence of migration was found, including no immunoreactivity against the migration markers doublecortin (DCX) or polysialic acid neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), and no dispersal of \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ or eYFP\u00a0+ cells through the midbrain parenchyma over time. However, \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ or eYFP\u00a0+ cells did increase in size and express higher levels of mature neuronal genes over time, indicating growth and neuronal differentiation. In mice whose SNc dopamine neurons had been depleted with 6-hydroxy-dopamine, a model of PD, there were ~\u00a02-fold more \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ cells in SNc specifically, although the proportion that were also NeuN\u00a0+ was not affected. Remarkably, as early as 4\u00a0days following putative Nestin-expression, many \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ or eYFP\u00a0+ cells had mature neuronal morphology and were NeuN\u00a0+. Furthermore, mature neuronal \u03b2-gal\u00a0+ cells were immunoreactive against the self-renewal or pluripotency marker sex determining region Y-box 2 (Sox2). Overall, our data support the notion that some Nestin-expressing, presumably NPCs, have a limited capacity for proliferation, no capacity for migration, and a propensity to generate new neurons within the microenvironment of the adult midbrain. However, our data also suggest that significant numbers of extant midbrain neurons express Nestin and other classical neurogenesis markers in contexts that are presumably not neurogenic. These findings foreshadow duplicitous roles for Nestin and other molecules that are traditionally associated with neurogenesis in the adult midbrain, which should be considered in future PD research.",

In addition, batch-to-batch variation of albumin may cause the inconsistent of hPSC cardiac differentiation. Here, we demonstrated that antioxidants l-ascorbic acid, trolox, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and sodium pyruvate could functionally substitute albumin in the culture medium, and formulated an albumin-free, chemical-defined medium (S12 medium). We showed that S12 medium could support efficient hPSC cardiac differentiation with significantly improved reproducibility, and maintained long-term culture of hPSC-CMs. Furthermore, under chemical-defined and albumin-free conditions, human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were established, and differentiated into highly homogenous atrial and ventricular myocytes in a scalable fashion with normal electrophysiological properties. Finally, we characterized the activity of three typical cardiac ion channels of those cells, and demonstrated that hPSC-derived ventricular cardiomyocytes (hPSC-vCMs) were suitable for drug cardiac safety evaluation. In summary, this simplified, chemical-defined and albumin-free culture medium supports efficient generation and maintaining of hPSC-CMs and facilitates both research and clinical applications of these cells.",

Furthermore, considering the limited therapeutic time-window for acute injuries, including neurotraumatic injuries, an iPS cell bank is of potential interest. However, due to the relatively immunoprivileged environment of the central nervous system, it is unclear whether HLA matching is required in hiPSC-derived neural stem/progenitor cell (hiPSC-NS/PC) transplantation for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and neurotraumatic injuries. In this study, we evaluated the significance of HLA matching in hiPSC-NS/PC transplantation by performing modified mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) assays with hiPSC-NS/PCs. Compared to fetus-derived NS/PCs, the expression levels of human leukocyte antigen-antigen D related (HLA-DR) and co-stimulatory molecules on hiPSC-NS/PCs were significantly low, even with the addition of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) and/or interferon-\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) to mimic the inflammatory environment surrounding transplanted hiPSC-NS/PCs in injured tissues.

Furthermore, the autologous response was also similar to the allogeneic response. hiPSC-NS/PCs suppressed the proliferative responses of allogeneic HLA-mismatched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, the low antigen-presenting function and immunosuppressive effects of hiPSC-NS/PCs result in a depressed immune response, even in an allogeneic HLA-mismatched setting. It is crucial to verify whether these in vitro results are reproducible in a clinical setting.",

     "abstract": "Breast tumors are heterogeneous and carry a small population of progenitor cells that can produce various subtypes of breast cancer. SATB2 (special AT-rich binding protein-2) is a newly identified transcription factor and epigenetic regulator. It is highly expressed in embryonic stem cells, but not in adult tissues, and regulates pluripotency-maintaining factors. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SATB2 induces transformation of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) leading to malignant phenotype are unknown. The main goal of this paper is to examine the molecular mechanisms by which SATB2 induces cellular transformation of HMECs into cells that are capable of self-renewal. SATB2-transformed HMECs gain the phenotype of breast progenitor cells by expressing markers of stem cells, pluripotency-maintaining factor, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. SATB2 is highly expressed in human breast cancer cell lines, primary mammary tissues and cancer stem cells (CSCs), but not in HMECs and normal breast tissues. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that SATB2 can directly bind to promoters of Bcl-2, c-Myc, Nanog, Klf4, and XIAP, suggesting a role of SATB2 in regulation of pluripotency, cell survival and proliferation. Furthermore, inhibition of SATB2 by shRNA in breast cancer cell lines and CSCs attenuates cell proliferation and EMT phenotype. Our results suggest that SATB2 induces dedifferentiation/transformation of mature HMECs into progenitor-like cells.",

The rate of proliferation was two times lower and the apoptosis was 2.5 times higher in lesions treated with MSCs than in untreated ones. While the laters presented dedifferentiated cells, the former maintained differentiated cells (cytokeratin and gene expression profile similar to normal tissue).Thus, MSC administration at papilloma stage precludes tumor growth and epithelial dedifferentiation of OSCC.",

In this study, we demonstrate that contrary to the well-established models of mouse ES cells (mESC) and transformed human cancer cells, the pluripotent state of human ES cells (hESC) involves expression of mature Let-7 family miRNAs with concurrent expression of all LIN28 proteins. We show that mature Let-7 miRNAs are regulated during hESC differentiation and have opposite expression profile with LIN28B. Moreover, mature Let-7 miRNAs fine tune the expression levels of LIN28B protein in pluripotent hESCs, whereas silencing of LIN28 proteins have no effect on mature Let-7 levels.

We analyzed the expression profiles of several key molecules of the RA signaling pathway in cultured incisor explants upon exogenous RA treatment. The expression patterns of these molecules suggested a negative feedback regulation of RA signaling in the developing incisor. We demonstrated that exogenous RA had negative effects on incisor SCs and that this was accompanied by downregulation of Fgf10, a mesenchymally expressed SC survival factor in the mouse incisor. Supplement of Fgf10 in incisor cultures completely blocked RA effects by antagonizing apoptosis and increasing proliferation in LaCL epithelial SCs.

Conversely, TBI can also stimulate neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation leading to increased numbers of neuroblasts migrating outside their restrictive neurogenic zone to areas of damage in support of tissue integrity. Unfortunately, the factors that regulate migration are poorly understood. Here, we examine whether ephrinB3 functions to restrict neuroblasts from migrating outside the subventricular zone (SVZ) and rostral migratory stream (RMS). We have previously shown that ephrinB3 is expressed in tissues surrounding these regions, including the overlying corpus callosum (CC), and is reduced after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury. Our current study takes advantage of ephrinB3 knockout mice to examine the influences of ephrinB3 on neuroblast migration into CC and cortex tissues after CCI injury. Both injury and/or ephrinB3 deficiency led to increased neuroblast numbers and enhanced migration outside the SVZ/RMS zones. Application of soluble ephrinB3-Fc molecules reduced neuroblast migration into the CC after injury and limited neuroblast chain migration in cultured SVZ explants. Our findings suggest that ephrinB3 expression in tissues surrounding neurogenic regions functions to restrict neuroblast migration outside the RMS by limiting chain migration.",

Here we used RT-PCR, western blot, and immunocytochemistry to show that adult hippocampal NPCs abundantly express Nurr1. We then examined the effect of Nurr1 activation on adult hippocampal NPCs using amodiaquine (AQ), an anti-malarial drug that was recently discovered to be a Nurr1 agonist. Cell proliferation assay showed that AQ significantly increased cell proliferation. AQ-treated NPCs showed increased levels of phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 whereas AQ-treated Nurr1 siRNA-transfected NPCs showed no changes in those levels. Further immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed the stimulating effect of Nurr1 agonist on the proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal NPCs both in vivo and in vitro. In addition to its effects on proliferation and differentiation of NPCs, AQ-treated mice showed a significant enhancement of both short- and long-term memory in the Y-maze and the novel object recognition test.

In addition to insulin synthesis and processing, rGBC2 presented many hallmark features of \u03b2 cells, including insulin secretion in response to high glucose stimulation.

When transplanted into immune-deficient animals, rGBC2 were stable for at least 5\u00a0months and further matured in vivo.

In order to investigate the role of increased Wnt secretion on tumor growth and the microenvironment, we generated a novel germ cell tumor model by overexpressing the Wnt secretion factor Evi/Wls in mouse embryonic stem cells. Evi-overexpressing teratoma were characterized by enhanced tumor growth in supporting a tumor-promoting role of Wnt secretion. Interestingly, enhanced Evi expression correlated with impaired immune cell recruitment. Specifically, T- and B-cell infiltration was reduced in Evi-overexpressing teratomas, which was independent of teratoma size and differentiation. Our study suggests that Wnt secretion impairs immunosurveillance. Since immune cell infiltration has been shown to have prognostic value, the levels of secreted Wnt activity might impact the efficiency of cancer immunotherapy.",

Here we show that bone marrow (BM) cells, especially T-cells and stromal cells, express and secrete copious amounts of BMP4 in response to irradiation, which causes the bone marrow stromal cells to commit to adipocyte lineage, thereby contributing to an increase in bone marrow adipogenesis. We further demonstrate that Simvastatin inhibits the BMP4-mediated adipogenic commitment of marrow stromal cells by inhibiting Ppar-\u03b3 expression. Importantly, Simvastatin does not prevent BMP4 secretion by the BM cells, and thus does not interfere with its salutary role in post-transplant hematopoietic regeneration.

However, there are several aspects of this procedure that have yet to be optimized to the extent required for translation to an optimal cell-based transplantation protocol in humans. These challenges include pinpointing the optimal graft location, appropriately scaling up the graft volume, and minimizing the risk of chronic immune rejection, among others. To advance this procedure to the clinic, it is imperative that a model that accurately and fully recapitulates characteristics most pertinent to a cell-based transplantation to the human brain is used to optimize key technical aspects of the procedure. Nonhuman primates mimic humans in multiple ways including similarities in genomics, neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, immunogenetics, and age-related changes in immune function. These characteristics are critical to the establishment of a relevant model in which to conduct preclinical studies to optimize the efficacy and safety of cell-based therapeutic approaches to the treatment of PD.

The application of Y-27632 to hIPSCs resulted in a decrease in actin bundling and disruption of colony formation in a concentration and time-dependent manner. Such changes in cell and colony morphology were associated with decreased expression of E-cadherin, a cell-cell junctional protein, proportional to the increased exposure to Y-27632. Interestingly, gene and protein expression of pluripotency markers such as NANOG and OCT4 were not downregulated by an exposure to Y-27632 up to 36\u00a0h. Simultaneously, epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition markers were upregulated with an exposure to Y-27632. These EMT-like changes in the cells with longer exposure to Y-27632 resulted in a significant increase in the subsequent differentiation efficiency towards mesendodermal lineage. In contrast, an inhibitory effect was observed when cells were subjected to ectodermal differentiation after prolonged exposure to Y-27632.

Interestingly, a significant fraction of cells within each clone failed to produce any reporter signals upon DOX treatment. We found that the majority of these non-responsive cells neither carry reporter transgene nor geneticin/G418 resistance.

We successfully eliminated most of these corrupted cells with repeated chemical (G418) selection, however, even after prolonged G418 treatments, a few cells remained non-responsive due to epigenetic silencing. We found that cell sorting has been the most efficient approach to select those cells which can uniformly and stably induce the integrated transgene in this ES cell based platform.

Identification of key niche mediated signaling that maintains stem cells in specific phenotypic states remains a challenge, mainly due to the complex and dynamic nature of stem cell-niche interactions. In order to overcome this, we consider that stem cells maintain their phenotypic state by experiencing a constant effect created by the niche by integrating its signals via signaling pathways. Such a constant niche effect should induce sustained activation/inhibition of specific stem cell signaling pathways that controls the gene regulatory program defining the cellular phenotypic state. Based on this view, we propose a computational approach to identify the most likely receptor mediated signaling responsible for transmitting niche signals to the transcriptional regulatory network that maintain cell-specific gene expression patterns, termed as niche determinants. We demonstrate the utility of our method in different stem cell systems by identifying several known and novel niche determinants. Given the key role of niche in several degenerative diseases, identification of niche determinants can aid in developing strategies for potential applications in regenerative medicine.",

Through screening small molecule libraries with annotated targets, we identified BET bromodomain inhibition as a novel mechanism for enhancing neurogenesis. BET bromodomain proteins, Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4 were found to be downregulated in NPCs upon differentiation, while their levels remain unaltered in proliferating NPCs. Consistent with the pharmacological study using bromodomain selective inhibitor (+)-JQ-1, knockdown of each BET protein resulted in an increase in the number of neurons with simultaneous reduction in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Gene expression profiling analysis demonstrated that BET bromodomain inhibition induced a broad but specific transcription program enhancing directed differentiation of NPCs into neurons while suppressing cell cycle progression and gliogenesis. Together, these results highlight a crucial role of BET proteins as epigenetic regulators in NPC development and suggest a therapeutic potential of BET inhibitors in treating brain injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.",

When expressed in neurospheres derived from the adult SVZ, miR-410 inhibits neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation, and promotes astrocyte differentiation. miR-410 also reverses the increase in neuronal differentiation and decreased astroglial differentiation caused by Noggin over-expression. Conversely, inhibition of miR-410 activity promotes neuronal and decreases astroglial differentiation of NSC.

Over-expression of Elavl4 transcripts without the endogenous 3\u2032UTR rescued the decrease in neuronal differentiation caused by miR-410 overexpression.

     "abstract": "Growing evidence suggests that the clinical use of neural progenitor cells (NPCs) is hampered by heterogeneity, poor neuronal yield and low survival rate. Recently, we reported that retrovirus-delivered human arginine decarboxylase (hADC) genes improve cell survival against oxidative insult in murine NPCs in vitro. This study investigates whether the induced expression of hADC gene in mNPCs induces any significant change in the cell fate commitment. The evaluation of induced hADC gene function was assessed by knockdown of hADC gene using specific siRNA. The hADC gene delivery triggered higher expression of N-CAM, cell adhesion molecule and MAP-2, neuronal marker. However, the hADC gene knockdown showed downregulation of N-CAM and MAP-2 expression suggesting that hADC gene delivery favors cell fate commitment of mNPCs towards neuronal lineage. Neurite outgrowth was significantly longer in the hADC infected cells. The neurotrophic signal, BDNF aided in the neuronal commitment, differentiation, and maturation of hADC-mNPCs through PI3K and ERK1/2 activation. The induction of neuron-like differentiation is believed to be regulated by the expression of GSK-3\u03b2 and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathways. Our findings suggest that hADC gene delivery favors cell fate commitment of mNPCs towards neuronal lineage, bring new advances in the field of neurogenesis and cell therapy.",

Moreover, gene expression levels of three VSMC specific transcriptional factors were up-regulated by miR-29a over-expression, but down-regulated by miR-29a inhibition or YY1 over-expression.

Moreover, A-T iPS cells generated with this protocol maintain long-term replicative potential, stable karyotypes, re-elongated telomeres and capability to differentiate along the neural lineage in vitro and to form teratomas in vivo.

     "abstract": "Recent studies have demonstrated that Sox2-expressing stem/progenitor cells play roles in the pituitary cell turnover. Two types of niches have been proposed for stem/progenitor cells, the marginal cell layer (MCL) and the dense cell clusters in the parenchyma. Among them, the appearance of the parenchymal-niche only after birth indicates that this niche is involved in the cell turnover required for the postnatal pituitary. However, little is known about the roles of the parenchymal-niche and its regulation. The present study aimed to isolate pituitary stem/progenitor cells from the parenchymal-niche in the adult rat pituitary. Cell dispersion by stepwise treatment with proteases allowed the isolation of dense cell clusters. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated that clusters are universally composed of SOX2-positive cells, and most of them are positive for PROP1. Taken together with the anatomical analysis, we concluded that the isolated clusters are the parenchymal stem/progenitor cell (PS)-clusters, not the MCL-one. PS-clusters cultivated by serum-free overlay 3-dimensional culture maintained their stemness, and treatment with bFGF and EGF induced cyst-formation. Moreover, PS-clusters demonstrated some differentiation capacity with GSK3\u03b2-inhibitor treatment. Collectively, the present study demonstrates a simple method for isolating stem/progenitor cells from the parenchymal-niche, and provides tools to analyze the factors for regulating the pituitary niches.",

     "abstract": "This study elucidated the stage-specific roles of FGF2 signaling during neural development using in-vitro human embryonic stem cell-based developmental modeling. We found that the dysregulation of FGF2 signaling prior to the onset of neural induction resulted in the malformation of neural rosettes (a neural tube-like structure), despite cells having undergone neural induction. The aberrant neural rosette formation may be attributed to the misplacement of ZO-1, which is a polarized tight junction protein and shown co-localized with FGF2/FGFR1 in the apical region of neural rosettes, subsequently led to abnormal neurogenesis. Moreover, the FGF2 signaling inhibition at the stage of neural rosettes caused a reduction in cell proliferation, an increase in numbers of cells with cell-cycle exit, and premature neurogenesis. These effects may be mediated by NUMB, to which expression was observed enriched in the apical region of neural rosettes after FGF2 signaling inhibition coinciding with the disappearance of PAX6+/Ki67+ neural stem cells and the emergence of MAP2+ neurons. Moreover, our results suggested that the hESC-based developmental system reserved a similar neural stem cell niche in vivo.",

The T-box transcription factor TBX3 has been implicated in the regulation of embryonic stem cell self-renewal and cardiogenesis. We have recently discovered that forced TBX3 expression in embryonic stem cells promotes mesendoderm specification directly by activating key lineage specification factors and indirectly by enhancing paracrine NODAL signalling. Interestingly, aberrant TBX3 expression is associated with breast cancer and melanoma formation. In other cancers, loss of TBX3 expression is associated with a more aggressive phenotype e.g. in gastric and cervical cancer. The precise function of TBX3 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma remains to be determined. In the current study we provide conclusive evidence for TBX3 overexpression in pancreatic cancer samples as compared to healthy tissue. While proliferation remains unaltered, forced TBX3 expression strongly increases migration and invasion, but also angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we describe the TBX3-dependency of cancer stem cells that perpetuate themselves through an autocrine TBX3\u2013ACTIVIN/NODAL signalling loop to sustain stemness. Thus, TBX3 is a new key player among pluripotency-related genes driving cancer formation.",

Here, we elucidate a novel Notch-dependent mechanism that induces endothelial to mesenchymal transition (EndMT) in confluent monolayer cultures of hESC-derived ECs. We demonstrate density-dependent induction of EndMT that can be rescued by the Notch signaling inhibitor DAPT and identify a positive feedback signaling mechanism in hESC-ECs whereby trans-activation of Notch by DLL4 ligand induces elevated expression and surface presentation of DLL4. Increased Notch activation in confluent hESC-EC monolayer cultures induces areas of EndMT containing transitional cells that are marked by increased Jagged1 expression and reduced Notch signal integration. Jagged1 loss of function in monolayer hESC-ECs induces accelerated feedback stimulation of Notch signaling, increased expression of cell-autonomous, cis-inhibitory DLL4, and EndMT. These data elucidate a novel interplay of Notch ligands in modulating pathway activation during both expansion and EndMT of hESC-derived ECs.",

Here we evaluated the energy and oxidative changes during the early adipogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived stromal cells (hASCs). hASCs were maintained under differentiation conditions during 3 and 7\u00a0days. Oxygen consumption, mitochondrial mass and membrane potential, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase activities, non-protein thiols (NPT) concentration and lipid peroxidation were analyzed. We observed that 7\u00a0days of adipogenic induction are required to stimulate cells to consume more oxygen and increase mitochondrial activity, indicating organelle maturation and a transition from glycolytic to oxidative energy metabolism. ROS production was only increased after 3\u00a0days and may be involved in the differentiation commitment. ROS source was not only the mitochondria and we suggest that NOX proteins are related to ROS generation and therefore adipogenic commitment. ROS production did not change after 7\u00a0days, but an increased activity of catalase and NPT concentration as well as a decreased lipid peroxidation were observed. Thus, a short period of differentiation induction is able to change the energetic and oxidative metabolic profile of hASCs and stimulate cytoprotection processes.",

Osteogenic capacity of these cells was assessed via absolute quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and through quantification of in vitro mineral deposition.

In mid-gestation, hepatoblasts mature into epithelial structures: the hepatocyte cords and biliary ducts. While EMT has been associated with liver bud formation, nothing is known about its contribution to hepatic specification. We previously established an efficient protocol from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) to generate hepatic cells (Hep cells) resembling the hepatoblasts expressing alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and albumin (ALB).

Similar epithelial and mesenchymal hepatoblasts were identified in human and mouse fetal livers, suggesting a conserved interspecies phenotype. Knock-down experiments demonstrated the importance of SNAI-1 in Hep cell hepatic specification. Moreover, ChIP assays revealed direct binding of SNAI-1 in the promoters of AFP and ALB genes consistent with its transcriptional activator function in hepatic specification.

Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) have been recently derived from several patients with ALS mutations and it has been shown that they can generate motoneurons in vitro, providing a valuable tool to study ALS.

     "abstract": "X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is required for dosage compensation of X-linked genes in human female cells. Several previous reports have described the promiscuous XCI status in long-term cultured female human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), and the majority of them exhibit non-random XCI. However, when and how such female hESCs acquire the aberrant XCI states during culture is unknown. Herein, through comparing the XCI states in 18 paired hES cell lines throughout early culture, we revealed a uniform dynamic change during this culture period under a widely used culture condition. The female initial hESCs (ihESCs, P4-P9) expressed XIST RNA, H3K27me3 punctate enrichment and displayed random XCI pattern. By further culturing, the female early hESCs (ehESCs, P20\u2013P30) lost the expression of XIST RNA, H3K27me3 punctate enrichment and exhibited a completely skewed XCI pattern. Importantly, a subset of X-linked genes was up-regulated in ehESCs, including some cancer-related genes. At last, we found 5% physiological oxygen was beneficial for the expression of XIST and H3K27me3 punctate enrichment, but not for the XCI pattern. We conclude that the XCI dynamic change is a frequent epigenetic instability event during early culture, which is accompanied by the up-regulation of some X-linked genes. Furthermore, we emphasize that physiological oxygen is beneficial for XCI fidelity.",

     "abstract": "Epigenetic changes, such as alteration of DNA methylation patterns, have been proposed as a molecular mechanism underlying the effect of alcohol on the maintenance of adult stem cells. We have performed genome-wide gene expression microarray and DNA methylome analysis to identify molecular alterations via DNA methylation changes associated with exposure of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) to ethanol (EtOH). By combined analysis of the gene expression and DNA methylation, we have found a significant number of genes that are potentially regulated by EtOH-induced DNA methylation. As a focused approach, we have also performed a pathway-focused RT-PCR array analysis to examine potential molecular effects of EtOH on genes involved in epigenetic chromatin modification enzymes, fibroblastic markers, and stress and toxicity pathways in DPSCs. We have identified and verified that lysine specific demethylase 6B (KDM6B) was significantly dysregulated in DPSCs upon EtOH exposure. EtOH treatment during odontogenic/osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs suppressed the induction of KDM6B with alterations in the expression of differentiation markers. Knockdown of KDM6B resulted in a marked decrease in mineralization from implanted DPSCs in vivo. Furthermore, an ectopic expression of KDM6B in EtOH-treated DPSCs restored the expression of differentiation-related genes. Our study has demonstrated that EtOH-induced inhibition of KDM6B plays a role in the dysregulation of odontogenic/osteogenic differentiation in the DPSC model. This suggests a potential molecular mechanism for cellular insults of heavy alcohol consumption that can lead to decreased mineral deposition potentially associated with abnormalities in dental development and also osteopenia/osteoporosis, hallmark features of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.",

After differentiation, cells expressed the main podocyte markers, such as synaptopodin, WT1, \u03b1-Actinin-4, P-cadherin and nephrin at the protein and mRNA level, and showed the low proliferation rate typical of mature podocytes. Exposure to Angiotensin II significantly decreased the expression of podocyte genes and cells underwent cytoskeleton rearrangement. Cells were able to internalize albumin and self-assembled into chimeric 3D structures in combination with dissociated embryonic mouse kidney cells.

Male C57BL/6J mice were placed on control or HFD for 8\u00a0weeks prior to and following initiation of a 16\u00a0week treadmill exercise program. ADSCs (Sca-1+\u00a0CD45\u2212) were isolated from epididymal adipose tissue and mRNA was evaluated using high throughput qPCR. Stromal cells were also obtained from skeletal muscle (MDSC). HFD decreased the quantity of ADSCs and markedly altered gene expression related to ECM remodeling (Col1\u03b11, MMP2, MMP9, Timp1). Exercise did not reverse these changes. MDSCs were minimally altered by HFD or exercise. Overall, the data from this study suggest that ADSCs decrease in quantity and contribute to adipose ECM remodeling in response to obesity, and exercise training does not significantly impact these outcomes.",

V. virus' 2\u2032-O-Methyltransferase enzyme creates a cap1 structure found in higher eukaryotes and has higher translation efficiency compared to other methods. Use of the polymeric transfection reagent polyethylenimine proved superior to other transfection methods.The mRNA created via this method did not trigger an intracellular immune response via human IFN-gamma (hIFN-\u03b3) or alpha (hIFN-\u03b1) release, thus circumventing the use of suppressors. Resulting mRNA and protein were expressed at high levels for over 48\u00a0h, thus obviating daily transfections. Using this method, we demonstrated swift activation of pluripotency associated genes in human fibroblasts. Low oxygen conditions further facilitated colony formation. Differentiation into different germ layers was confirmed via teratoma assay.Reprogramming with non-synthetic mRNA holds great promise for safe generation of iPSCs of human origin.

Previous studies using in vitro stem cell assays have suggested that the CD133-expressing prostate basal cells may serve as the putative prostate stem cells. However, the precise localization of the CD133-expressing cells and their contributions to adult murine prostate homeostasis in vivo remain undetermined. We show that loss of function of CD133 does not impair murine prostate morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration, implying a dispensable role for CD133 in prostate stem cell function. Using a CD133-CreERT2 model in conjunction with a fluorescent report line, we show that CD133 is not only expressed in a fraction of prostate basal cells, but also in some luminal cells and stromal cells. CD133+ basal cells possess higher in vitro sphere-forming activities than CD133\u2212 basal cells. However, the in vivo lineage tracing study reveals that the two cell populations possess the same regenerative capacity and contribute equally to the maintenance of the basal cell lineage. Similarly, CD133+ and CD133\u2212 luminal cells are functionally equivalent in maintaining the luminal cell lineage. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CD133 does not enrich for the stem cell activity in vivo in adult murine prostate.

We analyzed Ca2\u00a0+ signals and membrane properties in rat adipose-derived stromal cells (ADSCs) and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in basal conditions, and then following a switch into medium that contains factors known to modify their character. Modified ADSCs (mADSCs) expressed L-type Ca2\u00a0+ channels whereas both L- and P/Q- channels were operational in mBMSCs. Both mADSCs and mBMSCs possessed functional endoplasmic reticulum Ca2\u00a0+ stores, expressed ryanodine receptor-1 and -3, and exhibited spontaneous [Ca2\u00a0+]i oscillations. The mBMSCs expressed P2X7 purinoceptors; the mADSCs expressed both P2X (but not P2X7) and P2Y (but not P2Y1) receptors. Both types of stromal cells exhibited [Ca2\u00a0+]i responses to vasopressin (AVP) and expressed V1 type receptors. Functional oxytocin (OT) receptors were, in contrast, expressed only in modified ADSCs and BMSCs. AVP and OT-induced [Ca2\u00a0+]i responses were dose-dependent and were blocked by their respective specific receptor antagonists. Electrophysiological data revealed that passive ion currents dominated the membrane conductance in ADSCs and BMSCs. Medium modification led to a significant shift in the reversal potential of passive currents from \u2212\u00a040 to \u2212\u00a050\u00a0mV in cells in basal to \u2212\u00a080\u00a0mV in modified cells. Hence membrane conductance was mediated by non-selective channels in cells in basal conditions, whereas in modified medium conditions, it was associated with K+-selective channels. Our results indicate that modification of ADSCs and BMSCs by alteration in medium formulation is associated with significant changes in their Ca2\u00a0+ signaling and membrane properties.",

The Forkhead box transcription factor M1 (FOXM1) is critically required for the maintenance of pluripotency in mouse embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonal carcinoma cells, but its role in hESCs remains unclear. Here, we show that FOXM1 expression was enriched in undifferentiated hESCs and was regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner with peak levels detected at the G2/M phase. Expression of FOXM1 did not correlate with OCT4 and NANOG during in vitro differentiation of hESCs. Importantly, knockdown of FOXM1 expression led to aberrant cell cycle distribution with impairment in mitotic progression but showed no profound effect on the undifferentiated state. Interestingly, FOXM1 depletion sensitized hESCs to oxidative stress. Moreover, genome-wide analysis of FOXM1 targets by ChIP-seq identified genes important for M phase including CCNB1 and CDK1, which were subsequently confirmed by ChIP and RNA interference analyses. Further peak set comparison against a differentiating hESC line and a cancer cell line revealed a substantial difference in the genomic binding profile of FOXM1 in hESCs. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence to support FOXM1 as an important regulator of cell cycle progression and defense against oxidative stress in hESCs.",

Because acute bacterial infection in human prostate tissues is relatively rare, the disease relevance of the bacterial infection-induced basal-to-luminal differentiation is uncertain. Herein we employ a high fat diet-induced sterile prostate inflammation model to determine whether basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by inflammation irrespective of the underlying etiologies. A K14-CreER model and a fluorescent report line are utilized to specifically label basal cells with the green fluorescent protein. We show that high fat diet promotes immune cell infiltration into the prostate tissues and basal-to-luminal differentiation. Increased cell proliferation accompanies basal-to-luminal differentiation, suggesting a concurrent regulation of basal cell proliferation and differentiation. This study demonstrates that basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by different types of prostate inflammation evolved with distinct etiologies. Finally, high fat diet also accelerates initiation and progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that are originated from basal cells with loss-of-function of the tumor suppressor Pten. Because prostate cancer originated from basal cells tends to be invasive, our study also provides an alternative explanation for the association between obesity and aggressive prostate cancer.",

We dissected the hUC into its discrete sites and isolated hUC cells from the cord placenta junction (CPJ), cord tissue (CT), and Wharton's jelly (WJ). Isolated cells displayed fibroblastoid morphology, and expressed CD29, CD44, CD73, CD90, and CD105, and showed evidence of differentiation into multiple lineages in vitro.

Microarray analysis further revealed the differences in the gene expression of CPJ-, CT- and WJ-hUC cells. Five coding and five lncRNA genes were differentially expressed in low vs. high passage hUC cells. Only MAEL was expressed at high levels in both low and high passage CPJ-hUC cells.

To this end, we examined if the anisotropic orientation of hPSC-CMs imposed by the underlying aligned fibers within a 3D microenvironment could improve the maturation of hPSC-CMs. Enriched hPSC-CMs were cultured for two weeks on Matrigel-coated anisotropic (aligned) and isotropic (random) polycaprolactone (PCL) fibrous scaffolds, as well as tissue culture polystyrenes (TCPs) as a control. As expected, hPSC-CMs grown on the two types of fibrous scaffolds exhibited anisotropic and isotropic orientations, respectively. Similar to cells on TCPs, hPSC-CMs cultured on these scaffolds expressed CM-associated proteins and were pharmacologically responsive to adrenergic receptor agonists, a muscarinic agonist, and a gap junction uncoupler in a dose-dependent manner. Although hPSC-CMs grown on anisotropic fibrous scaffolds displayed the highest expression of genes encoding a number of sarcomere proteins, calcium handling proteins and ion channels, their calcium transient kinetics were slower than cells grown on TCPs. These results suggest that electrospun anisotropic fibrous scaffolds, as a single method, have limited effect on improving the maturation of hPSC-CMs.",

Differentiation assays included immunohistology, cell-specific alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and osteogenic, chondrogenic as well as adipogenic marker gene qRT-PCR. Expression of BMSC-associated surface markers was analyzed using flow cytometry.No significant intergroup differences were observed concerning the proliferation potential, cell-specific ALP activity as well as adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation marker gene expressions. Interestingly, SOX9 gene expression levels were significantly increased in OA-BMSCs after 14\u00a0days of chondrogenic stimulation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). The surface markers CD73, CD90 and STRO-1 were elevated in relation to CD14, CD34 and CD45 in both groups (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). Notably, OA-BMSCs showed significantly increased CD90 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and decreased CD166 (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) levels.Overall, the in vitro characteristics of BMSCs are not markedly influenced by OA.

CDCs were reported to contain only small subpopulations of c-kit+ cells and recent publications suggested that depletion of the c-kit+ subpopulation of cells has no effect on regenerative properties of CDCs. However, our current study showed that the vast majority of CDCs from murine heart actually express c-kit, albeit, in an intracellular and non-glycosylated form. Immunostaining and flow cytometry showed that the fluorescent signal indicative of c-kit immunostaining significantly increased when cell membranes were permeabilized. Western blots further demonstrated that glycosylation of c-kit was increased during endothelial differentiation in a time dependent manner. Glycosylation inhibition by 1-deoxymannojirimycin hydrochloride (1-DMM) blocked c-kit glycosylation and reduced expression of endothelial cell markers such as Flk-1 and CD31 during differentiation. Pretreatment of these cells with a c-kit kinase inhibitor (imatinib mesylate) also attenuated Flk-1 and CD31 expression. These results suggest that c-kit glycosylation and its kinase activity are likely needed for these cells to differentiate into an endothelial lineage. In vivo, we found that intracellular c-kit expressing cells are located in the wall of cardiac blood vessels in mice subjected to myocardial infarction. In summary, our work demonstrated for the first time that c-kit is not only expressed in CDCs but may also directly participate in CDC differentiation into an endothelial lineage.",

Accumulating evidence reveals an intimate link between embryonic development, stem cells, and cancer formation. In line, a growing number of oncofetal proteins are found to play common roles within these processes. Cancer stem cells share features with true stem cells by having the capacity to self-renew in a de-differentiated state, to generate heterogeneous types of differentiated progeny, and to give rise to the bulk tumor. Further, various studies identified genes in cancer stem cells, which were previously shown to regulate the pluripotency circuitry, particularly the so-called \u201cYamanaka-Factors\u201d (OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and c-MYC).

While likely multi-factorial, the effect may in part be associated with the impact of radiation on the neurogenic niches. In the adult mammalian brain, the neurogenic niches are localized in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where the neural stem cells (NSCs) reside. Several reports showed that radiation produces a drastic decrease in the proliferative capacity of these regions, which is related to functional decline. In particular, radiation to the SVZ led to a reduced long-term olfactory memory and a reduced capacity to respond to brain damage in animal models, as well as compromised tumor outcomes in patients. By contrast, other studies in humans suggested that increased radiation dose to the SVZ may be associated with longer progression-free survival in patients with high-grade glioma. In this review, we summarize the cellular and functional effects of irradiating the SVZ niche. In particular, we review the pros and cons of using radiation during brain tumor treatment, discussing the complex relationship between radiation dose to the SVZ and both tumor control and toxicity.",

To validate our findings in-vivo, we determined the relative expression of CD44 and CD24 in clinical samples of OSCC patients. CD44 expression was consistently high whereas CD24 showed significantly lower expression in tumour tissues. Further, the gene expression profile of the CSC and non-CSC population unravels the molecular pathways which may contribute to stemness.

During iCM reprogramming, the starting fibroblasts must overcome existing epigenetic barriers to acquire the CM-like chromatin pattern. However, epigenetic dynamics along this reprogramming process have not been studied. Here, we took advantage of our recently generated polycistronic system and determined the dynamics of two critical histone marks, H3K27me3 and H3K4me3, in parallel with gene expression at a set of carefully selected cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming. We observed reduced H3K27me3 and increased H3K4me3 at cardiac promoters as early as day 3, paralleled by a rapid significant increase in their mRNA expression. In contrast, H3K27me3 at loci encoding fibroblast marker genes did not increase until day 10 and H3K4me3 progressively decreased along the reprogramming process; these changes were accompanied by a gradual decrease in the mRNA expression of fibroblast marker genes. Further analyses of fibroblast-enriched transcription factors revealed a similarly late deposition of H3K27me3 and decreased mRNA expression of Sox9, Twist1 and Twist2, three important players in epithelial\u00a0\u2212\u00a0mesenchymal transition. Our data suggest early rapid activation of the cardiac program and later progressive suppression of fibroblast fate at both epigenetic and transcriptional levels. Additionally, we determined the DNA methylation states of representative cardiac promoters and found that not every single CpG was equally demethylated during early stages of iCM reprogramming. Rather, there are specific CpGs, whose demethylation states correlated tightly with transcription activation, that we propose are the major contributing CpGs. Our work thus reveals a differential re-patterning of H3K27me3, H3K4me3 at cardiac and fibroblast loci during iCM reprogramming and could provide future genome-wide epigenetic studies with important guidance such as the appropriate time window and loci to be utilized as positive and negative controls.",

This provides a new source of cells in which to establish preclinical allogeneic transplantation models. Our iPS cells were generated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) transfected with the Yamanaka factors, the four transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc), without antibiotic selection or MEF feeders. After the formation of embryoid bodies (EBs), iPS cells spontaneously differentiated into Flk1-positive cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific markers such as alpha sarcomeric actinin (\u03b1-actinin), cardiac alpha myosin heavy chain (\u03b1-MHC), cardiac troponin T (cTnT), and connexin 43 (CX43), as well as cardiac transcription factors Nk2 homebox 5 (Nkx2.5) and gata binding protein 4 (gata4). The electrophysiological activity of iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPS-CMs) was detected in beating cell clusters with optical mapping and RH237 a voltage-sensitive dye, and in single contracting cells with patch-clamp technology. Incompletely differentiated iPS cells formed teratomas when transplanted into a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model of myocardial infarction. Our results show that somatic cells can be reprogrammed into pluripotent stem cells, which in turn spontaneously differentiate into electrophysiologically functional mature cardiomyocytes expressing cardiac-specific makers, and that these cells can potentially be used to repair myocardial infarction (MI) in the future.",

Yet the major limitations of this model are the lengthy differentiation procedure and its low efficiency, although recent studies suggest that the differentiation process can be shortened to less than 1\u00a0week using nucleoside analogues. To explore whether short-term exposure of NT2 cells to the nucleoside analogue cytosine \u03b2-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC) could be a suitable method to efficiently generate mature neurons, we conducted a neurochemical and morphometric characterization of AraC-differentiated NT2N (AraC/NT2N) neurons and improved the differentiation efficiency by modifying the cell culture schedule. Moreover, we analyzed the neurotransmitter phenotypes of AraC/NT2N neurons. Cultures obtained by treatment with AraC were highly enriched in postmitotic neurons and essentially composed of dual glutamatergic/cholinergic neurons, which contrasts with the preferential GABAergic phenotype that we found after RA differentiation.Taken together, our results further reinforce the notion NT2 cells are a versatile source of neuronal phenotypes and provide a new encouraging platform for studying mechanisms of neuronal differentiation and for exploring neuronal replacement strategies.",

Human feeder cells have been used to eliminate this risk; however, efficiency from xenobiotic-free cultures on a monolayer appears to be lower than in the standard method using 3T3 cells. We investigated whether bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, could serve as feeder cells for the expansion of LSCs in the 3-dimensional (3D) system. Primary single human LSCs on a monolayer of 3T3s served as the control. Very poor growth was observed when single LSCs were cultured on BMSCs. When LSC clusters were cultured on a BMSC monolayer (CC-BM), 3D culture system (3D CC-BM) and fibrin 3D system (fibrin 3D CC-BM), the 3D CC-BM method supported a greater LSC expansion. The 3D CC-BM system produced a 2.5-fold higher cell growth rate than the control (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The proportion of K14+ and p63\u03b1bright cells was comparable to those in the control (p\u00a0>\u00a00.05), whereas the proportion of K12+ cells was lower (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

Therefore, we developed the advanced method with the cell-defined siRNA microarray (CDSM), for functional analysis of genes in small scale within slide glass using human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs).We designed cell spot system with biomaterials (sucrose, gelatin, poly-l-lysine and matrigel) to control the attachment of hBMSCs inside spot area on three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel-coated slides. The p65 expression was used as a validation standard which described our previous report. For the optimization of siRNA mixture, first, we detected five kinds of commercialized reagent (Lipofectamine 2000, RNAi-Max, Metafectine, Metafectine Pro, TurboFectin 8.0) via validation. Then, according to quantification of p65 expression, we selected 2\u00a0\u03bcl of RNAi-Max as the most effective reagent condition on our system. Using same validation standard, we optimized sucrose and gelatin concentration (80\u00a0mM and 0.13%), respectively. Next, we performed titration of siRNA quantity (2.66\u20135.55\u00a0\u03bcM) by reverse transfection time (24\u00a0h, 48\u00a0h, 72\u00a0h) and confirmed 3.75\u00a0\u03bcM siRNA concentration and 48\u00a0h as the best condition. To sum up the process for optimized CDSM, 3\u00a0\u03bcl of 20\u00a0\u03bcM siRNA (3.75\u00a0\u03bcM) was transferred to the 384-well V-bottom plate containing 2\u00a0\u03bcl of dH2O and 2\u00a0\u03bcl of 0.6\u00a0M sucrose (80\u00a0mM). Then, 2\u00a0\u03bcl of RNAi-Max was added and incubated for 20\u00a0min at room temperature after mixing gently and centrifugation shortly. Five microliters of gelatin (0.26%) and 2\u00a0\u03bcl of growth factor reduced phenol red-free matrigel (12.5%) were added and mixed by pipetting gently. Finally, optimized siRNA mixture was printed on 3D hydrogel-coated slides and cell-defined attachment and siRNA reverse transfection were induced.The efficiency of this CDSM was verified using three siRNAs (targeting p65, Slug, and N-cadherin), with persistent gene silencing for 5\u00a0days. We obtained the significant and reliable data with effective knock-down in our condition, and suggested our method as the qualitatively improved siRNA microarray screening method for hBMSCs.",

Increased levels of ZAC1 rapidly promoted upregulation of CDK inhibitors P57 and P27 followed by cell cycle exit. Surprisingly this was accompanied by stalled neuronal differentiation. Genome wide expression analysis of cortical cells overexpressing Zac1 revealed a decrease in neuronal gene expression and an increased expression of imprinted genes, factors regulating mesoderm formation as well as features of differentiated muscle. In addition, we observed a rapid induction of several genes regulating pluripotency. Taken together, our data suggests that expression levels of Zac1 need to be kept under strict control to avoid premature cell cycle exit, disrupted neurogenesis and aberrant expression of non-neuronal genes including pluripotency associated factors.",

Previously, we identified tri-potent progenitor cells in the adult (2\u20134\u00a0month-old) murine pancreas that were capable of self-renewal and differentiation into duct, acinar, and endocrine cells in vitro. These progenitor cells were named pancreatic colony-forming units (PCFUs). However, because PCFUs are a minor population in the pancreas (~\u00a01%) they are difficult to study. To enrich PCFUs, strategies using cell-surface marker analyses and fluorescence-activated cell sorting were developed. We found that CD133highCD71low cells, but not other cell populations, enriched PCFUs by up to 30 fold compared to the unsorted cells. CD133highCD71low cells generated primary, secondary, and subsequent colonies when serially re-plated in Matrigel-containing cultures, suggesting self-renewal abilities. In the presence of a laminin hydrogel, CD133highCD71low cells gave rise to colonies that contained duct, acinar, and Insulin+\u00a0Glucagon+ double-hormonal endocrine cells. Colonies from the laminin hydrogel culture were implanted into diabetic mice, and five weeks later duct, acinar, and Insulin+\u00a0Glucagon\u2212 cells were detected in the grafts, demonstrating tri-lineage differentiation potential of CD133highCD71low cells. These CD133highCD71low cells will enable future studies of putative adult pancreas stem cells in vivo.",

We asked if CsA had similar effects on NPCs in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus, leading to increased neurogenesis. We used the in vitro and in vivo assays to examine CsA's effect on the size of the NPC pool and the proliferation and differentiation profile of cells within the DG. We found that CsA increases the numbers of NPCs and enriches for neurogenic NPCs in vitro. Similarly, in vivo systemic administration of CsA for 7\u00a0days increases the size of the NPC pool in the DG observed through increases in numbers of proliferating cells and newborn neurons. Consistent with CsA's pro-survival effects, we have shown that CsA enhances the survival of newborn cells that normally undergo cell death over the time of infusion. Together these findings support the hypothesis that CsA administration promotes neurogenesis and may have implications for neural repair.",

In addition, with proteoglycans ubiquitous to the neural niche, we also examined heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and their regulatory enzymes. Our results demonstrate that hNSC H9 cells maintain self-renewal and multipotent capacity during extended culture and express HS biosynthesis enzymes and several HSPG core protein syndecans (SDCs) and glypicans (GPCs) at a high level. In addition, hNSC H9 cells exhibit high neuronal and a restricted glial differentiative potential with lineage differentiation significantly increasing expression of many HS biosynthesis enzymes. Furthermore, neuronal differentiation of the cells upregulated SDC4, GPC1, GPC2, GPC3 and GPC6 expression with increased GPC4 expression observed under astrocyte culture conditions. Finally, downregulation of selected HSPG core proteins altered hNSC H9 cell lineage potential. These findings demonstrate an involvement for HSPGs in mediating hNSC maintenance and lineage commitment and their potential use as novel markers of hNSC and neural cell lineage specification.",

No significant changes in gene expression, as measured by RNA-Seq, or cytosine modification levels, as measured by the Illumina 450K arrays, were observed between batches relative to changes over time. As expected, neurotoxic chemotherapeutics affected neuronal outgrowth, but no inter-batch differences were observed in sensitivity to paclitaxel, vincristine and cisplatin. As a testament to the utility of the model for studies of neuropathy, we observed that genes involved in neuropathy had relatively higher expression levels in these samples across different time points. Our results suggest that the process used to differentiate iPSCs into neurons is consistent, resulting in minimal intra-individual variability across batches.

Bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of a core set of canonical mBMSC CD markers with comparable expression levels in mBMSCBone and mBMSCAdipo at baseline and during their differentiation.

Unfortunately, most drug candidates have failed in clinical trials, potentially due to species differences among rodents and humans. It is unclear, however, whether there are different responses to drugs among the causative genes of ALS or their associated mutations. In this study, to evaluate different SOD1 mutations, we generated SOD1-ALS models derived from human embryonic stem cells with identical genetic backgrounds, except for the overexpression of mutant variants of SOD1. The overexpression of mutant SOD1 did not affect pluripotency or MN differentiation. However, mutation-dependent reductions in neurite length were observed in MNs. Moreover, experiments investigating the effects of specific compounds revealed that each ALS model displayed different responses with respect to MN neurite length.

Although the combination of chemical inhibitors called 2i can establish mouse iPSCs without LIF from primed pluripotent stem cells, it has been difficult, if not impossible, to establish mouse iPSCs from differentiated somatic cells without LIF. We previously showed that the fusion gene of the transactivation domain of MyoD and the full-length Oct4 (M3O) increases the efficiency of making iPSCs when transduced into fibroblasts along with Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc (M3O-SKM). Here, we report that M3O-SKM allows for establishment of iPSCs without exogenous LIF from mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The established iPSCs remained undifferentiated and maintained pluripotency over 90\u00a0days without LIF as long as M3O was expressed. The iPSCs upregulated miR-205-5p, which was potentially involved in the LIF-independence by suppressing the two signaling pathways inhibited by 2i.

Interestingly, generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells depended on the background of ES cell lines; possible by extracts from C57, but not from E14. Proteomic analysis of two different mES cell lines (C57 and E14) shows that embryonic Ras (E-Ras) is expressed differently in two mES cell lines; high level of E-Ras only in C57 mESC whose extracts allows iPS cells production from somatic cells. Here, we show that E-Ras augments the efficiency in reprogramming of fibroblast by promoting cell proliferation. We found that over-expression of E-Ras in fibroblast increased cell proliferation which was caused by specific up-regulation of cyclins D and E, not A or B, leading to the accelerated G1 to S phase transition. To figure out the common transcription factor of cyclins D and E, we used TRANSFAC database and selected SP1 as a candidate which was confirmed as enhancer of cyclins D and E by luciferase promoter assay using mutants. As downstream signaling pathways, E-Ras activated only c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) but not ERK or p38. Inhibition of JNK prevented E-Ras-mediated induction of pSP1, cyclins D, E, and cell proliferation. Finally, E-Ras transduction to fibroblast enhanced the efficiency of iPS cell generation by 4 factors (Oct4/Klf4/Sox2/C-myc), which was prevented by JNK inhibitor. In conclusion, E-Ras stimulates JNK, enhances binding of Sp1 on the promoter of cyclins D and E, leading to cell proliferation. E-Ras/JNK axis is a critical mechanism to generate iPS cells by transduction of 4 factors or by treatment of mESC protein extracts.",

     "abstract": "The niche concept of stem cell biology proposes a functional unit between the precursor cells and their local microenvironment, to which several cell types might contribute by cell\u2013cell contacts, extracellular matrix, and humoral factors. We here established three co-culture models (with cell types separated by membrane) for both adherent monolayers and neurospheres to address the potential influence of different niche cell types in the neurogenic zone of the adult hippocampus of mice. Astrocytes and endothelial cells enhanced precursor cell proliferation and neurosphere formation. Endothelial factors also led to a prolonged increase in proliferation after growth factor withdrawal, which otherwise induces differentiation. All niche cell types enhanced cell survival in monolayer cultures, endothelial cells also stimulated neuronal differentiation. A parallel trend elicited by astrocytes did not reach conventional statistical significance. Pericytes had variable effects here. We did not observe changes in differentiation in neurosphere co-cultures. In summary, our data indicate that in precursor cell culture protocols survival could be improved by adding as yet unknown factors physiologically contributed by astrocytes and endothelial cells. Our findings also underscore the complexity of the niche and the differential impact of factors from the different sources on distinct aspects of neuronal development. With the help of the models presented here, identification of these factors and their specific biological activity can now be initiated.",

     "abstract": "In the adult dentate gyrus (DG) and in the proliferative zone lining the lateral ventricle (LV-PZ), radial glia-like (RGL) cells are neural stem cells (NSCs) that generate granule neurons. A number of molecular markers including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Sox2 and nestin, can identify quiescent NSCs in these two niches. However, to date, there is no marker that distinguishes NSC origin of DG versus LV-PZ. Hopx, an atypical homeodomain only protein, is expressed by adult stem cell populations including those in the intestine and hair follicle. Here, we show that Hopx is specifically expressed in RGL cells in the adult DG, and these cells give rise to granule neurons. Assessed by non-stereological quantitation, Hopx-null NSCs exhibit enhanced neurogenesis evident by an increased number of BrdU-positive cells and doublecortin (DCX)-positive neuroblasts. In contrast, Sox2-positive, quiescent NSCs are reduced in the DG of Hopx-null animals and Notch signaling is reduced, as evidenced by reduced expression of Notch targets Hes1 and Hey2, and a reduction of the number of cells expressing the cleaved, activated form of the Notch1 receptor, the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in Hopx-null DG. Surprisingly, Hopx is not expressed in RGL cells of the adult LV-PZ, and Hopx-expressing cells do not give rise to interneurons of the olfactory bulb (OB). These findings establish that Hopx expression distinguishes NSCs of the DG from those of the LV-PZ, and suggest that Hopx potentially regulates hippocampal neurogenesis by modulating Notch signaling.",

Leukemic cells derived from 18 unselected AML patients were cultured with bone marrow MSCs derived from healthy donors; the populations then being separated by a semipermeable membrane. Coculture had only minor effects on MSC proliferation. The unique cytokine network in cocultures was determined by high constitutive MSC release of certain cytokines (especially IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor) and constitutive release of a wide range of soluble mediators by primary AML cells. However, the AML cell release varied considerably between patients, and these differences between patients were also reflected in the coculture levels even though supra-additive effects were seen for many mediators. These effects on the local cytokine network were dependent on a functional crosstalk between the two cell subsets. The crosstalk altered the global gene expression profile of the MSCs, especially expression of genes encoding proteins involved in downstream signaling from Toll like receptors, NF\u03baB signaling and CCL/CXCL chemokine release. Thus, primary AML cells alter the functional phenotype of normal MSCs.",

     "abstract": "In contrast to urodele amphibians and teleost fish, mammals lack the regenerative responses to replace large body parts. Amphibian and fish regeneration uses dedifferentiation, i.e., reversal of differentiated state, as a means to produce progenitor cells to eventually replace damaged tissues. Therefore, induced activation of dedifferentiation responses in mammalian tissues holds an immense promise for regenerative medicine. Here we demonstrate that ectopic expression of Msx2 in cultured mouse myotubes recapitulates several aspects of amphibian muscle dedifferentiation. We found that MSX2, but not MSX1, leads to cellularization of myotubes and downregulates the expression of myotube markers, such as MHC, MRF4 and myogenin. RNA sequencing of myotubes ectopically expressing Msx2 showed downregulation of over 500 myotube-enriched transcripts and upregulation of over 300 myoblast-enriched transcripts. MSX2 selectively downregulated expression of Ptgs2 and Ptger4, two members of the prostaglandin pathway with important roles in myoblast fusion during muscle differentiation. Ectopic expression of Msx2, as well as Msx1, induced partial cell cycle re-entry of myotubes by upregulating CyclinD1 expression but failed to initiate S-phase. Finally, MSX2-induced dedifferentiation in mouse myotubes could be recapitulated by a pharmacological treatment with trichostatin A (TSA), bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) and fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1). Together, these observations indicate that MSX2 is a major driver of dedifferentiation in mammalian muscle cells.",

Runx1 is not normally expressed by adult neural stem or progenitor cells (NSPCs) but is induced in a subpopulation of putative NSPCs after brain injury in adult mice. In order to investigate the role of Runx1 in NSPCs, we established neurosphere cultures of adult mouse subventricular zone NSPCs. We show that Runx1 is basally expressed in neurosphere culture. Removal of the mitogen bFGF or addition of 1% FBS decreased Runx1 expression. Inhibition of endogenous Runx1 activity with either Ro5-3335 or shRNA-mediated Runx1 knockdown inhibited NSPC proliferation without affecting differentiation. Lentiviral mediated over-expression of Runx1 in neurospheres caused a significant change in cell morphology without reducing proliferation. Runx1-overexpressing neurospheres changed from floating spheres to adherent colonies or individual unipolar or bipolar cells. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that Runx1 over-expression produced a significant increase in expression of the neuronal marker TuJ1 and a minor increase in the astrocytic marker S100\u03b2. Thus, Runx1 expression drove adult NSPC differentiation, predominantly toward a neuronal lineage. These data suggest that Runx1 could be manipulated after injury to promote neuronal differentiation to facilitate repair of the CNS.",

An immortalised HSC-like line (HPC7) was pre-treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), activated platelet releasate enriched supernatant (PES) or platelet microparticles (PMPs). Subsequent adhesion was monitored using adhesion assays or in vivo ischaemia\u2013reperfusion (IR) and colitis injured mouse colon intravitally. Integrin clustering was determined confocally and cell morphology using scanning electron microscopy. Both injuries resulted in increased HPC7 adhesion within colonic mucosal microcirculation. H2O2 and PES significantly enhanced adhesion in vitro and in the colitis, but not IR injured, colon. PMPs had no effect on adhesion. PES and PMPs induced clustering of integrins on the HPC7 surface, but did not alter their expression. Adhesion to the colon is modulated by injury but only in colitis injury can this recruitment be enhanced. The enhanced adhesion induced by PES is likely through integrin distribution changes on the HPC7 surface. Improving local HSC presence in injured colon may result in better therapeutic efficacy for treatment of IBD.",

To delay hip arthroplasty, core decompression combined with concentrated total bone marrow (BM) treatment is currently performed in the early stages of the osteonecrosis. Cell therapy efficacy depends on the quantity of implanted BM stromal cells. For this reason, expanded bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells) can be used to improve osteonecrosis treatment in SCD patients. In this study, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the function of BMSCs isolated from a large number of SCD patients with osteonecrosis (SCD-ON) compared with control groups (patients with osteonecrosis not related to SCD (ON) and normal donors (N)). BM total nuclear cells and colony-forming efficiency values (CFE) were significantly higher in SCD-ON patients than in age and sex-matched controls. The BMSCs from SCD-ON patients were similar to BMSCs from the control groups in terms of their phenotypic and functional properties.SCD-ON patients have a higher frequency of BMSCs that retain their bone regeneration potential. Our findings suggest that BMSCs isolated from SCD-ON patients can be used clinically in cell therapy approaches.

They have demonstrated the ability to migrate towards distant tumor microsatellites and effectively deliver the therapeutic payload, thus significantly improving survival in experimental animal models for brain tumor. Despite such optimistic results, the efficacy of NSC-based anti-cancer therapy has been limited due to the restricted tumor homing ability of NSCs. To examine this issue, we investigated the mechanisms of tumor-tropic migration of an FDA-approved NSC line, HB1.F3.CD, by performing a gene expression analysis. We identified vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) and membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinase (MMP14) as molecules whose expression are significantly elevated in migratory NSCs. We observed increased expression of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) in the focal adhesion complexes of migratory NSCs, with downstream activation of VEGFR2-dependent kinases such as p-PLC\u03b3, p-FAK, and p-Akt, a signaling cascade reported to be required for cellular migration. In an in vivo orthotopic glioma xenograft model, analysis of the migratory trail showed that NSCs maintained expression of VEGFR2 and preferentially migrated within the perivascular space. Knockdown of VEGFR2 via shRNAs led to significant downregulation of MMP14 expression, which resulted in inhibited tumor-tropic migration. Overall, our results suggest, the involvement of VEGFR2-regulated MMP14 in the tumor-tropic migratory behavior of NSCs. Our data warrant investigation of MMP14 as a target for enhancing the migratory properties of NSC carriers and optimizing the delivery of therapeutic payloads to disseminated tumor burdens.",

     "publication date": "11-2015",
     "abstract": "Several studies have reported the beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tissue repair and regeneration. New sources of stem cells in adult organisms are continuously emerging; dental tissues have been identified as a source of postnatal MSCs. Dental bud is the immature precursor of the tooth, is easy to access and we show in this study that it can yield a high number of cells with \u2265\u00a095% expression of mesenchymal stemness makers and osteogenic capacity. Thus, these cells can be defined as Dental Bud Stem Cells (DBSCs) representing a promising source for bone regeneration of stomatognathic as well as other systems. Cell interactions with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and neighboring cells are critical for tissue morphogenesis and architecture; such interactions are mediated by integrins and cadherins respectively. We characterized DBSCs for the expression of these adhesion receptors and examined their pattern during osteogenic differentiation. Our data indicate that N-cadherin and cadherin-11 were expressed in undifferentiated DBSCs and their expression underwent changes during the osteogenic process (decreasing and increasing respectively), while expression of E-cadherin and P-cadherin was very low in DBSCs and did not change during the differentiation steps. Such expression pattern reflected the mesenchymal origin of DBSCs and confirmed their osteoblast-like features. On the other hand, osteogenic stimulation induced the upregulation of single subunits, \u03b1V, \u03b23, \u03b15, and the formation of integrin receptors \u03b15\u03b21 and \u03b1V\u03b23. DBSCs differentiation toward osteoblastic lineage was enhanced when cells were grown on fibronectin (FN), vitronectin (VTN), and osteopontin (OPN), ECM glycoproteins which contain an integrin-binding sequence, the RGD motif. In addition we established that integrin \u03b1V\u03b23 plays a crucial role during the commitment of MSCs to osteoblast lineage, whereas integrin \u03b15\u03b21 seems to be dispensable. These data suggest that functionalization of biomaterials with such ECM proteins would improve bone reconstruction therapies starting from dental stem cells.",

Despite the large circumstantial evidence linking UVB irradiation and limbal epithelial stem cell damage, the precise molecular responses of limbal stem cells to UVB irradiation are unclear. Here the effect of UVB irradiation on the putative stem cell phenotype, limbal niche cells and the subsequent effects on corneal (lymph)angiogenic privilege were investigated. Primary human limbal epithelial stem cells and fibroblasts were irradiated with 0.02\u00a0J/cm2 of UVB, a low dose corresponding to 3\u00a0min of solar irradiation. UVB irradiation caused significant reduction of limbal epithelial and limbal fibroblast proliferation for 24\u00a0h, but apoptosis of limbal epithelial stem cells only. Moreover, UVB induced stem-like character loss of limbal epithelial cells, as their colony forming efficiency and putative stem cell marker expression significantly decreased. Interestingly, limbal epithelial cells co-cultured with UVB-irradiated limbal fibroblasts also exhibited loss of stem cell character and decrease of colony forming efficiency. Conditioned media from limbal epithelial cells inhibited lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation and tube network complexity; however this effect diminished following UVB irradiation. In contrast, pro-inflammatory and macrophage-recruiting cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3 and MCP1 were significantly upregulated following cell irradiation of limbal fibroblasts. These data demonstrate the key role of the limbal stem cell niche in response to UVB and subsequent (lymph)angiogenic and inflammatory events. These data suggest that the known pro(lymph)angiogenic effect of UVB irradiation in pterygium is not linked to a direct up-regulation of pro-angiogenic cytokines, but rather to indirect macrophage-recruiting cytokines being upregulated after UVB irradiation.",

Our group recently reported on the optimization of a workflow for a sensitive proteomic study of hBMSCs. Here, we couple this workflow with a label-free protein quantitation method to investigate the molecular responses of hBMSCs to long-term in vitro passaging. We explored the proteomic responses of hBMSCs by assessing the expression levels of proteins at early passage (passage 3, P3) and late passage (P7). We used multiple biological as well as technical replicates to ensure that the detected proteomic changes are repeatable between cultures and thus likely to be biologically relevant. Over 1700 proteins were quantified at three passages and a list of differentially expressed proteins was compiled. Bioinformatics-based network analysis and term enrichment revealed that metabolic pathways are largely altered, where many proteins in the glycolytic, pentose phosphate, and TCA pathways were shown to be largely upregulated in late passages. We also observed significant proteomic alterations in functional categories including apoptosis, and ER-based protein processing and sorting following in vitro cell aging. We posit that the comprehensive map outlined in this report of affected phenotypes as well as the underpinning molecular factors tremendously benefit the effort to uncovering targets that are not just used only to monitor cell fitness but can be employed to slowdown the in vitro aging process in hBMSCs and hence ensure manufacturing of cells with known quality, efficacy and stability.",

Clones of labelled cells were induced in adult CAGG-CreER;R26R-LacZ reporter mice and their distributions analysed after different chase periods. Short-lived clones, derived from labelled transient amplifying cells, were shed during the chase period and long-lived clones, derived from stem cells, expanded.

Similar stripes extended across the cornea in CAGG-CreER;R26R-mT/mG reporter mice. The distributions of labelled clones are inconsistent with the CESC hypothesis and support the LESC hypothesis if LESCs cycle between phases of activity and quiescence, each lasting several weeks.",

Although several sources of stem cells are currently available, acquiring these involve invasive procedures, may be difficult or expensive to generate and are limited in number. Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are multipotent stem cells that reside deep the pulp of shed teeth. To investigate the characteristics of DPSCs that make them a valuable resource for translational research, we performed a set of viability, senescence, immortalization and gene expression studies on control DPSC and derived neurons. We investigated the basic transport conditions and maximum passage number for primary DPSCs. We immortalized control DPSCs using human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and evaluated neuronal differentiation potential and global gene expression changes by RNA-seq. We show that neurons from immortalized DPSCs share morphological and electrophysiological properties with non-immortalized DPSCs. We also show that differentiation of DPSCs into neurons significantly alters gene expression for 1305 transcripts. Here we show that these changes in gene expression are concurrent with changes in protein levels of the transcriptional repressor REST/NRSF, which is known to be involved in neuronal differentiation. Immortalization significantly altered the expression of 183 genes after neuronal differentiation, 94 of which also changed during differentiation.

     "abstract": "Stem cell-based neuronal differentiation has provided a unique opportunity for disease modeling and regenerative medicine. Neurospheres are the most commonly used neuroprogenitors for neuronal differentiation, but they often clump in culture, which has always represented a challenge for neurodifferentiation. In this study, we report a novel method and defined culture conditions for generating sub-type or region-specific neurons from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells derived neurosphere without any genetic manipulation. Round and bright-edged neurospheres were generated in a supplemented knockout serum replacement medium (SKSRM) with 10% CO2, which doubled the expression of the NESTIN, PAX6 and FOXG1 genes compared with those cultured with 5% CO2. Furthermore, an additional step (AdSTEP) was introduced to fragment the neurospheres and facilitate the formation of a neuroepithelial-type monolayer that we termed the \u201cneurosphederm\u201d. The large neural tube-type rosette (NTTR) structure formed from the neurosphederm, and the NTTR expressed higher levels of the PAX6, SOX2 and NESTIN genes compared with the neuroectoderm-derived neuroprogenitors. Different layers of cortical, pyramidal, GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic neurons appeared within 27\u00a0days using the neurosphederm, which is a shorter period than in traditional neurodifferentiation-protocols (42\u201360\u00a0days). With additional supplements and timeline dopaminergic and Purkinje neurons were also generated in culture too. Furthermore, our in vivo results indicated that the fragmented neurospheres facilitated significantly better neurogenesis in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse brains compared with the non-fragmented neurospheres. Therefore, this neurosphere-based neurodifferentiation protocol is a valuable tool for studies of neurodifferentiation, neuronal transplantation and high throughput screening assays.",

We recently reported that doxycycline, an anti-bacterial agent, had dramatic effects on hESC/iPSC survival and promoted self-renewal. In this study, we extended the effects of doxycycline to a more practical issue to save cost and labor in hESC/iPSC cultures. Regardless of cultured cell conditions, hESCs/iPSCs in doxycycline-supplemented media were viable and proliferating for at least 3\u00a0days without media change, while none or few viable cells were detected in the absence of doxycycline in the same conditions. Thus, hESCs/iPSCs supplemented with doxycycline can be cultured for a long period of time with media changes at 3-day intervals without altering their self-renewal and pluripotent properties, indicating that doxycycline supplementation can reduce the frequency of media changes and the amount of media required by 1/3. These findings strongly encourage the use of doxycycline to save cost and labor in culturing hESCs/iPSCs.",

RNA-Seq analysis of E14.5 FL versus BM derived HSCs identified increased expression levels of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) and the citric acid cycle (TCA). We demonstrated that FL HSCs contain more mitochondria than BM HSCs, which resulted in increased levels of oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Higher levels of DNA repair and antioxidant pathway gene expression may prevent ROS-mediated (geno)toxicity in FL HSCs. Thus, we here for the first time highlight the underestimated importance of oxygen dependent pathways for generating energy and building blocks in FL HSCs.",

     "abstract": "Understanding how to achieve efficient transduction of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), while preserving their long-term ability to self-reproduce, is key for applying lentiviral-based gene engineering methods. SAMHD1 is an HIV-1 restriction factor in myeloid and resting CD4+ T cells that interferes with reverse transcription by decreasing the nucleotide pools or by its RNase activity. Here we show that SAMHD1 is expressed at high levels in HSPCs cultured in a medium enriched with cytokines. Thus, we hypothesized that degrading SAMHD1 in HSPCs would result in more efficient lentiviral transduction rates. We used viral like particles (VLPs) containing Vpx, shRNA against SAMHD1, or provided an excess of dNTPs or dNs to study this question. Regardless of the method applied, we saw no increase in the lentiviral transduction rate. The result was different when we used viruses (HR-GFP-Vpx\u00a0+) which carry Vpx and encode GFP. These viruses allow assessment of the effects of Vpx specifically in the transduced cells. Using HR-GFP-Vpx\u00a0+ viruses, we observed a modest but significant increase in the transduction efficiency. These data suggest that SAMHD1 has some limited efficacy in blocking reverse transcription but the major barrier for efficient lentiviral transduction occurs before reverse transcription.",

In the present study, we demonstrated that stabilizing actin filaments by inhibiting gene expression of the two main actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs): Cofilin 1 (CFL1) and Destrin (DSTN) in hMSCs, enhanced cell viability and differentiation into osteoblastic cells (OB) in vitro, as well as heterotopic bone formation in vivo. Similarly, treating hMSC with Phalloidin, which is known to stabilize polymerized actin filaments, increased hMSCs viability and OB differentiation. Conversely, Cytocholasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, reduced cell viability and inhibited OB differentiation of hMSC. At a molecular level, preventing Cofilin phosphorylation through inhibition of LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK1) decreased cell viability and impaired OB differentiation of hMSCs. Moreover, depolymerizing actin reduced FAK, p38 and JNK activation during OB differentiation of hMSCs, while polymerizing actin enhanced these signaling pathways. Our results demonstrate that the actin dynamic reassembly and Cofilin phosphorylation loop is involved in the control of hMSC proliferation and osteoblasts differentiation.",

Few reports exist concerning the induction of oral ectoderm from embryonic stem (ES) cells. Generally, any lot differences in fetal bovine serum (FBS) and serum replacer may affect the induction of ES cell-differentiation. Using a previously established culture strategy for differentiation, the proportion of cell aggregates containing Pitx1\u00a0+ oral ectoderm varied widely between 9\u201336% when several different lots of FBS or serum replacer were used. We therefore tried to enhance the differentiation method. We found that bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) 4 and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) treatments improved oral ectoderm induction. Such treatment also improved the differentiation of oral ectoderm into the adenohypophysis. Furthermore, increased BMP4 treatment induced dental epithelium and mesenchyme. Such differentiation suggests that the Pitx1\u00a0+ layer displays similar properties to oral ectoderm, as found in vivo. Differentiation of ES cells into oral ectoderm using different lots of FBS and serum replacer increased 78\u201390% after treatment with BMP4 and FGF.

Previously, we reported that vitamin C is transported into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) through the sodium dependent Vitamin C Transporter 2 (SVCT2) and this transporter plays an important role in osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, this transporter is regulated by oxidative stress. To date, however, the exact role of vitamin C and its transporter (SVCT2) in ROS regulated autophagy and apoptosis in BMSCs is poorly understood. In the present study, we observed that oxidative stress decreased survival of BMSCs in a dose-dependent manner and induced growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. These effects were accompanied by the induction of autophagy, confirmed by P62 and LC3B protein level and punctate GFP-LC3B distribution. The supplementation of vitamin C significantly rescued the BMSCs from oxidative stress by regulating autophagy. Knockdown of the SVCT2 transporter in BMSCs synergistically decreased cell survival even under low oxidative stress conditions. Also, supplementing vitamin C failed to rescue cells from stress. Our results reveal that the SVCT2 transporter plays a vital role in the mechanism of BMSC survival under stress conditions. Altogether, this study has given new insight into the role of the SVCT2 transporter in oxidative stress related autophagy and apoptosis in BMSCs.",

Our study aimed to optimize the generation of hiPSCs derived myogenic cells by employing selection of CD34 positive cells and followed by distinct, stepwise culture conditions. Following the expansion of CD34 positive single cells under myogenic cell culture conditions, serum deprived myoblast-like cells finally fused and formed multinucleated striated myotubes that expressed a set of key markers for muscle differentiation. In addition, these myotubes contracted upon electrical stimulation, responded to acetylcholine (Ach) and were able to generate action potentials. Finally, we co-cultured motoneurons and myotubes generated from identical hiPSCs cell lines. We could observe the early aggregation of acetylcholine receptors in muscle cells of immature co-cultures. At later stages, we identified and characterised mature neuromuscular junctions (NMJs). In summary, we describe here the successful generation of an iPS cell derived functional cellular system consisting of two distinct communicating cells types. This in vitro co-culture system could therefore contribute to research on diseases in which the motoneurons and the NMJ are predominantly affected, such as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal muscular atrophy.",

For long-term survival of engrafting cells in the body, not only do the cells have to execute liver-specific function but also withstand the physical strains and invading pathogens. The cellular innate immune system orchestrated by the interferon (IFN) pathway provides the first line of defense against pathogens. The objective of this study is to assess the innate immune function as well as to systematically profile the IFN-induced genes during hepatic differentiation of pluripotent stem cells. To address this objective, we derived endodermal cells (day 5 post-differentiation), hepatoblast (day 15) and hepatocyte-like cells (day 21) from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Day 5, 15 and 21 cells were stimulated with IFN-\u03b1 and subjected to IFN pathway analysis. Transcriptome analysis was carried out by RNA sequencing. The results showed that the IFN-\u03b1 treatment activated STAT\u2013JAK pathway in differentiating cells. Transcriptome analysis indicated stage specific expression of classical and non-classical IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Subsequent validation confirmed the expression of novel ISGs including RASGRP3, CLMP and TRANK1 by differentiated hepatic cells upon IFN treatment. Hepatitis C virus replication in hESC-derived hepatic cells induced the expression of ISGs \u2014 LAMP3, ETV7, RASGRP3, and TRANK1. The hESC-derived hepatic cells contain intact innate system and can recognize invading pathogens. Besides assessing the tissue-specific functions for cell therapy applications, it may also be important to test the innate immune function of engrafting cells to ensure adequate defense against infections and improve graft survival.",

Still the hormonal regulations and cellular mechanisms controlling these events are not entirely elucidated.

As well, our results indicate that this pathway regulates mammary stem cell hierarchy by inducing the differentiation of luminal progenitor (EpCAMhi/CD49fhi) cells to mature luminal (EpCAMhi/CD49flow) cells. Moreover, our data indicate that PRL/Jak2 coordinates both of these cellular events through limiting the mitogen activated protein kinase (Erk1/2) pathway.

However, the path from PSCs to robustly induced HSCs (iHSCs) in vitro remains elusive. We hypothesize that the modification of hematopoietic niche cells by transcription factors facilitates the derivation of induced HSCs from PSCs. The Lhx2 transcription factor is expressed in fetal liver stromal cells but not in fetal blood cells. Knocking out Lhx2 leads to a fetal hematopoietic defect in a cell non-autonomous role. In this study, we demonstrate that the ectopic expression of Lhx2 in OP9 cells (OP9-Lhx2) accelerates the hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs. OP9-Lhx2 significantly increased the yields of hematopoietic progenitor cells via co-culture with PSCs in vitro. Interestingly, the co-injection of OP9-Lhx2 and PSCs into immune deficient mice also increased the proportion of hematopoietic progenitors via the formation of teratomas. The transplantation of phenotypic HSCs from OP9-Lhx2 teratomas but not from the OP9 control supported a transient repopulating capability. The upregulation of Apln gene by Lhx2 is correlated to the hematopoietic commitment property of OP9-Lhx2. Furthermore, the enforced expression of Apln in OP9 cells significantly increased the hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs. These results indicate that OP9-Lhx2 is a good cell line for regeneration of hematopoietic progenitors both in vitro and in vivo.",

     "abstract": "Neuroblastoma, a malignancy of multipotent embryonic neural crest cells, is the most common extracranial solid cancer in childhood and most common cancer in infancy. Cellular phenotype has been shown to be an important determinant of the malignant potential in human neuroblastoma cells and tumors. Whereas neuroblastic (N-type) are moderately malignant and nonneuronal (S-type) cells are nonmalignant, I-type stem cells are highly tumorigenic, irrespective of N-myc amplification status. In the present study, we sought to determine which genes were overexpressed in the I-type cells which might characterize and maintain the stem cell state and/or malignancy of human neuroblastoma cancer stem cells. We used a microarray platform to compare the steady-state expression levels of mRNAs from 13 human neuroblastoma cell lines representing the three cellular phenotypes. Using qRT-PCR and Western blot analyses, we identified seven genes whose expression is consistently elevated exclusively in neuroblastoma cancer stem cells: CD133, KIT, NOTCH1, GPRC5C, PIGF2, TRKB, and LNGFR. Moreover, we show that the genes are phenotype specific, as differentiation of I-type BE(2)-C cells to either an N- or S-type morphology results in significantly reduced mRNA expression. Finally, we show that NOTCH1 plays an important role in maintaining the stem cell phenotype. The identification and characterization of these genes, elevated in highly malignant neuroblastoma stem cells, could provide the basis for developing novel therapies for treatment of this lethal childhood cancer.",

By contrast, we did not observe a significant increase of DNA methylation imprint at the Peg3, Snrpn and Dlk1\u2013Dio3 imprinted regions in ES cells lacking TET proteins. Interestingly, loss of TET proteins did not result in a significant increase of DNA methylation imprint at the Igf2\u2013H19 and Peg1 imprinted regions in the embryoid bodies (EB).

The transcriptional repressor REST represses miR-21 and, thus, regulates self-renewal in E14Tg2a.4 mESCs cultured in the absence of mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cell effects. However, how miR-21 connects to the nuclear regulatory network has not been clear. Here, we show that miR-21, a direct target of REST-mediated repression, directly targets Sox2. Exogenously added miR-21 to mESCs decreases the expression of Sox2, decreasing mESC self-renewal, and this effect of miR-21 on mESC self-renewal can be blocked by expression of exogenous Sox2. Conversely, destabilization of Sox2 by miR-21 can be blocked by anti-miR-21.

     "abstract": "Stem cell differentiation is a complex biological event. Our understanding of this process is partly hampered by the co-existence of different cell subpopulations within a given population, which are characterized by different gene expression states driven by different underlying transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs). Such cellular heterogeneity has been recently explored with the modern single-cell gene expression profiling technologies, such as single-cell RT-PCR and RNA-seq. However, the identification of cell subpopulation-specific TRNs and genes determining specific lineage commitment (i.e., lineage specifiers) remains a challenge due to the slower development of appropriate computational and experimental workflows. Here, we propose a computational method for predicting lineage specifiers for different cell subpopulations in binary-fate differentiation events. Our method first reconstructs subpopulation-specific TRNs, which is more realistic than reconstructing a single TRN representing multiple cell subpopulations. Then, it predicts lineage specifiers based on a model that assumes that each parental stem cell subpopulation is in a stable state maintained by its specific TRN stability core. In addition, this stable state is maintained in the parental cell subpopulation by the balanced gene expression pattern of pairs of opposing lineage specifiers for mutually exclusive different daughter cell subpopulations. To this end, we devised a statistical metric for identifying opposing lineage specifier pairs that show a significant ratio change upon differentiation. Application of this computational method to three different stem cell systems predicted known and putative novel lineage specifiers, which could be experimentally tested. Our method does not require pre-selection of putative candidate genes, and can be applied to any binary-fate differentiation system for which single-cell gene expression data are available. Furthermore, this method is compatible with both single-cell RT-PCR and single-cell RNA-seq data. Given the increasing importance of single-cell gene expression data in stem cell biology and regenerative medicine, approaches like ours would be useful for the identification of lineage specifiers and their associated TRN stability cores.",

     "abstract": "Human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) are a population of progenitor cells that contain a subset of skeletal stem cells (hSSCs), able to recreate cartilage, bone, stroma that supports hematopoiesis and marrow adipocytes. As such, they have become an important resource in developing strategies for regenerative medicine and tissue engineering due to their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. The differentiation of SSCs/BMSCs is dependent on exposure to biophysical and biochemical stimuli that favor early and rapid activation of the in vivo tissue repair process. Exposure to exogenous stimuli such as an electromagnetic field (EMF) can promote differentiation of SSCs/BMSCs via ion dynamics and small signaling molecules. The plasma membrane is often considered to be the main target for EMF signals and most results point to an effect on the rate of ion or ligand binding due to a receptor site acting as a modulator of signaling cascades. Ion fluxes are closely involved in differentiation control as stem cells move and grow in specific directions to form tissues and organs. EMF affects numerous biological functions such as gene expression, cell fate, and cell differentiation, but will only induce these effects within a certain range of low frequencies as well as low amplitudes. EMF has been reported to be effective in the enhancement of osteogenesis and chondrogenesis of hSSCs/BMSCs with no documented negative effects. Studies show specific EMF frequencies enhance hSSC/BMSC adherence, proliferation, differentiation, and viability, all of which play a key role in the use of hSSCs/BMSCs for tissue engineering. While many EMF studies report significant enhancement of the differentiation process, results differ depending on the experimental and environmental conditions. Here we review how specific EMF parameters (frequency, intensity, and time of exposure) significantly regulate hSSC/BMSC differentiation in vitro. We discuss optimal conditions and parameters for effective hSSC/BMSC differentiation using EMF treatment in an in vivo setting, and how these can be translated to clinical trials.",

Precisely defining the \u201cidentity\u201d and differentiation potential of somatic stem cells from different sources, has proven difficult, given differences in sets of specific markers, protocols used and lack of side-by-side characterization of these cells in different studies. Therefore, we set to compare expression of mesenchymal and neural markers in human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs), pediatric adipose-derived stem cells (p-ADSCs) in parallel with human neural stem cells (NSCs). We show that UC-MSCs at a basal level express mesenchymal and so-called \u201cneural\u201d markers, similar to that we previously reported for the p-ADSCs. All somatic stem cell populations studied, independently from tissue and patient of origin, displayed a remarkably similar expression of surface markers, with the main difference being the restricted expression of CD133 and CD34 to NSCs. Expression of certain surface and neural markers was affected by the expansion medium used. As predicted, UC-MSCs and p-ADSCs demonstrated tri-mesenchymal lineage differentiation potential, though p-ADSCs display superior chondrogenic differentiation capability. UC-MSCs and p-ADSCs responded also to neurogenic induction by up-regulating neuronal markers, but crucially they appeared morphologically immature when compared with differentiated NSCs. This highlights the need for further investigation into the use of these cells for neural therapies. Crucially, this study demonstrates the lack of simple means to distinguish between different cell types and the effect of culture conditions on their phenotype, and indicates that a more extensive set of markers should be used for somatic stem cell characterization, especially when developing therapeutic approaches.",

Treatment with physiological levels of estradiol (E2) induced both CXCL12 and CXCR4 expression in hESCs and BMCs, respectively. BMCs migrated towards hESCs conditioned media; a CXCR4 antagonist blocked migration indicating that CXCL12 acting through its receptor, CXCR4, is necessary for chemoattraction of BM cells to human endometrial cells. E2 increased both CXCL12 expression in endometrial cells and CXCR4 expression in BM cells, further enhancing chemoattraction. E2 induced CXCL12/CXCR4 expression in endometrium and BM, respectively, drives migration of stem cells to the endometrium.

For this purpose we have analyzed neuronal and glial cell markers, neuronal outgrowth, soma size, depolarization-induced distal shifts of the axon initial segment as well as glutamate-evoked calcium influx. Retinoic acid preconditioning led to a higher yield of neurons vs. glia cells and longer axons than unconditioned controls.

The disease results from a mutation of the stem cell receptor (c-kit) in mast cells and we wondered if the function of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs; also known as MSCs or mesenchymal stem cells) might be affected by the invasion of bone marrow by mutant mast cells. As expected, BMSCs from SM patients do not have a mutation in c-kit, but they proliferate poorly. In addition, while osteogenic differentiation of the BMSCs seems to be deficient, their adipogenic potential appears to be increased. Since the hematopoietic supportive abilities of BMSCs are also important, we also studied the engraftment in NSG mice of human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors, after being co-cultured with BMSCs of healthy volunteers vs. BMSCs derived from patients with SM. BMSCs derived from the bone marrow of patients with SM could not support hematopoiesis to the extent that healthy BMSCs do. Finally, we performed an expression analysis and found significant differences between healthy and SM derived BMSCs in the expression of genes with a variety of functions, including the WNT signaling, ossification, and bone remodeling. We suggest that some of the symptoms associated with SM might be driven by epigenetic changes in BMSCs caused by dysfunctional mast cells in the bone marrow of the patients.",

We grafted murine NSCs into the hippocampus of non-tg and APP tg that were treated systemically with CBL and analyzed after 1, 3, 6 and 9\u00a0months post grafting. Compared to vehicle-treated non-tg mice, in the vehicle-treated APP tg mice there was considerable reduction in the survival of the grafted NSCs. Whereas, CBL treatment enhanced the survival of NSCs in both non-tg and APP tg with the majority of the surviving NSCs remaining as neuroblasts. The NSCs of the CBL treated mice displayed reduced numbers of caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells and increased brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and furin immunoreactivity.

Current extracellular matrix protein (ECMP)-based substrates for the culture of hNPCs are expensive, difficult to isolate, subject to batch-to-batch variations, and, therefore, unsuitable for clinical application of hNPCs. Using a high-throughput array-based screening approach, we identified a synthetic polymer, poly(4-vinyl phenol) (P4VP), that supported the long-term proliferation and self-renewal of hNPCs. The hNPCs cultured on P4VP maintained their characteristic morphology, expressed high levels of markers of multipotency, and retained their ability to differentiate into neurons.

Conditional deletion of Sirt1 in hematopoietic cells did not abrogate the beneficial effects of SRT3025, indicating that the drug did not act by directly stimulating Sirt1 in stem cells, but must be acting indirectly via extra-hematopoietic effects.

Subsequently, c-Kit+Lin\u2212 and Sca-1+Lin\u2212 cardiac stem cells (CSCs) were quantified using flow cytometry while cardiac muscle-derived stromal cells (CMSCs, also known as cardiac-derived mesenchymal stem cells) were assessed using in vitro colony-forming unit fibroblast assay (CFU-F). Only the number of c-Kit+Lin\u2212 cells increased in the hypertrophied heart. To investigate a possible extracardiac origin of these cells, a parabiotic eGFP transgenic/wild-type mouse model was used. The parabiotic pairs were subjected to swimming, and the wild-type heart in particular was tested for eGFP+ stem cells. The results revealed a negligible number of extracardiac stem cells in the heart, allowing us to infer a cardiac origin for the increased amount of detected c-Kit+ cells. In conclusion, the number of resident Sca-1+Lin\u2212 cells and CMSCs was not changed, whereas the number of c-Kit+Lin\u2212 cells was increased during physiological cardiac hypertrophy. These c-Kit+Lin\u2212 CSCs may contribute to the physiological cardiac remodeling that result from exercise training.",

     "abstract": "Pancreatic duct glands (PDGs) have molecular features known to mark stem cell niches, but their function remains to be determined. To investigate the role of PDGs as a progenitor niche, PDGs were analyzed in both humans and mice. Cells were characterized by immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis. In vivo proliferative activity and migration of PDG cells were evaluated using a BrdU tag-and-chase strategy in a mouse model of pancreatitis. In vitro migration assays were used to determine the role of trefoil factor (TFF) -1 and 2 in cell migration. Proliferative activity in the pancreatic epithelium in response to inflammatory injury is identified principally within the PDG compartment. These proliferating cells then migrate out of the PDG compartment to populate the pancreatic duct. Most of the pancreatic epithelial migration occurs within 5\u00a0days and relies, in part, on TFF-1 and -2. After migration, PDG cells lose their PDG-specific markers and gain a more mature pancreatic ductal phenotype. Expression analysis of the PDG epithelium reveals enrichment of embryonic and stem cell pathways. These results suggest that PDGs are an epithelial progenitor compartment that gives rise to mature differentiated progeny that migrate to the pancreatic duct. Thus PDGs are a progenitor niche important for pancreatic epithelial regeneration.",

     "abstract": "The role of serum amyloid A (SAA) proteins, which are ligands for toll-like receptors, was analyzed in human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and their osteogenic offspring with a focus on senescence, differentiation and mineralization. In vitro aged hMSC developed a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), resulting in enhanced SAA1/2, TLR2/4 and proinflammatory cytokine (IL6, IL8, IL1\u03b2, CXCL1, CXCL2) expression before entering replicative senescence. Recombinant human SAA1 (rhSAA1) induced SASP-related genes and proteins in MSC, which could be abolished by cotreatment with the TLR4-inhibitor CLI-095. The same pattern of SASP-resembling genes was stimulated upon induction of osteogenic differentiation, which is accompanied by autocrine SAA1/2 expression. In this context additional rhSAA1 enhanced the SASP-like phenotype, accelerated the proinflammatory phase of osteogenic differentiation and enhanced mineralization. Autocrine/paracrine and rhSAA1 via TLR4 stimulate a proinflammatory phenotype that is both part of the early phase of osteogenic differentiation and the development of senescence. This signaling cascade is tightly involved in bone formation and mineralization, but may also propagate pathological extraosseous calcification conditions such as calcifying inflammation and atherosclerosis.",

In this study, we evaluate the behavior of umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs), labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles, transplanted in healthy or early symptomatic transgenic SOD1G93A mice (a murine model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). The double labeling of cells with nanoparticles and Hoechst-33258 enabled their tracking for a long time in both cells and tissues. Whole-body distribution of UC-MSCs was performed by in-vivo and ex-vivo analyses 1, 7, 21\u00a0days after single intravenous or intracerebroventricular administration. By intravenous administration cells were sequestered by the lungs and rapidly cleared by the liver. No difference in biodistribution was found among the two groups. On the other hand, UC-MSCs transplanted in lateral ventricles remained on the choroid plexus for the whole duration of the study even if decreasing in number. Few cells were found in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice exclusively. No migration in brain parenchyma was observed. These results suggest that the direct implantation in brain ventricles allows a prolonged permanence of cells close to the damaged areas and makes this method of tracking reliable for future studies of efficacy.",

In this report, we have extended previous observations concerning donor age and passage number of human fibroblasts as critical determinants of the efficiency of iPSC induction. Human fibroblasts from 11 different donors of variable age were reprogrammed by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors. Although all fibroblasts gave rise to iPSC colonies, the reprogramming efficiency correlated negatively and declined rapidly with increasing donor age. In addition, the late passage fibroblasts gave less reprogrammed colonies than the early passage cell counterparts, a finding associated with the cellular senescence-induced upregulation of p21. Knockdown of p21 restored iPSC generation even in long-term passaged fibroblasts of an old donor, highlighting the central role of the p53/p21 pathway in cellular senescence induced by both donor age and culture time.",

However, the differentiation from OPCs to oligodendrocytes is disturbed under stressed conditions. Therefore, drugs that can improve oligodendrocyte regeneration may be effective for white matter-related diseases. Here we show that a vasoactive peptide adrenomedullin (AM) promotes the in vitro differentiation of OPCs under pathological conditions. Primary OPCs were prepared from neonatal rat brains, and differentiated into myelin-basic-protein expressing oligodendrocytes over time. This in vitro OPC differentiation was inhibited by prolonged chemical hypoxic stress induced by non-lethal CoCl2 treatment. However, AM promoted the OPC differentiation under the hypoxic stress conditions, and the AM receptor antagonist AM22\u201352 canceled the AM-induced OPC differentiation. In addition, AM treatment increased the phosphorylation level of Akt in OPC cultures, and correspondingly, the PI3K/Akt inhibitor LY294002 blocked the AM-induced OPC differentiation. Taken together, AM treatment rescued OPC maturation under pathological conditions via an AM-receptor-PI3K/Akt pathway. Oligodendrocytes play critical roles in white matter by forming myelin sheath. Therefore, AM signaling may be a promising therapeutic target to boost oligodendrocyte regeneration in CNS disorders.",

     "abstract": "Aside from its role in cell membrane integrity, cholesterol is a key component in steroid hormone production. The vital functions of steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone, glucocorticoids (Gcrts) and mineralocorticoids (Mnrts) in perinatal and adult life are well understood; however, their role during early embryonic development remains largely unexplored. Here we show that siRNA-mediated perturbation of steroid hormone production during mesoderm formation has important consequences on cardiac differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC). Both Gcrts and Mnrts are capable of driving cardiac differentiation in mESC. Interestingly, the Gcrt receptor is widely expressed during gastrulation in the mouse, and is exclusively localized in the nuclei\u2014and thus active\u2014in visceral endoderm cells, suggesting that it functions much earlier than previously anticipated. We therefore studied Gcrt signaling in mESC as a model of the gastrulating embryo, and found that Gcrt signaling regulates expression of the transcription factor Hnf4a and the secreted Nodal and BMP inhibitor Cer1 in the early visceral endoderm. RNAi-mediated knockdown of Gcrt function blocked cardiomyocyte differentiation, with limited effects on other cardiovascular cell types including vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle. Furthermore, the cardiogenic effect of Gcrts required Hnf4a and paracrine Cer1. These results establish a novel function for cholesterol-derived steroid hormones and identify Gcrt signaling in visceral endoderm cells as a regulator of Cer1 and cardiac fate.",

Here, we have used an H2B-Egfp transgenic system to demonstrate that K-RasG12D accelerates the proliferative kinetics of quiescent intestinal stem cells. As in the TAC compartment, the effect of mutant K-Ras on the quiescent stem cell is dependent upon activation of MEK. Mutant K-Ras is also able to increase self-renewal potential of intestinal stem cells following damage.

Recently, O-GlcNAc has been linked to human embryonic stem cells (hESC) differentiation, however the identity and function of O-GlcNAc proteins regulating hESC remain unknown. Here, we firstly identified O-GlcNAc modified human stem cell regulators such as hnRNP K, HP1\u03b3, and especially RING1B/RNF2. Thereafter, we focused our work on RING1B which is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) a major epigenetic repressor essential for pluripotency maintenance and differentiation. By point-mutation, we show that T250/S251 and S278 RING1B residues are bearing O-GlcNAc, and that T250/S251 O-GlcNAcylation decreases during differentiation. O-GlcNAc seems to regulate RING1B-DNA binding as suggested by our ChIP-sequencing results. Non-O-GlcNAcylated RING1B is found to be enriched near cell cycle genes whereas O-GlcNAcylated RING1B seems preferentially enriched near neuronal genes. Our data suggest that during hESC differentiation, the decrease of RING1B O-GlcNAcylation might enable PRC1 to switch its target to induce neuron differentiation. Overall, we demonstrate that O-GlcNAc modifies and regulates an essential epigenetic tool, RING1B, which may contribute to hESC pluripotency maintenance and differentiation.",

Yet, their lack of accessibility from fetuses and from the brain of diseased patients has hindered our understanding of their full implication in developmental and pathogenic processes. Human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are an alternative source to obtain large quantities of astrocytes in vitro, for mechanistic studies of development and disease. However, these studies often require highly pure populations of astrocytes, which are not always achieved, depending on the PSC lines and protocols used.

Retinal progenitor phenotypes induced from embryonic stem cells/induced pluripotent stem cells (ESCs/iPSCs) and endogenous retinal stem cells may replace lost photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and restore vision in the diseased eye, whereas treatment of injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) has so far been reliant on mesenchymal stem cells (MSC).

We conclude that ESCs/iPSCs have the potential to replace lost retinal cells, whereas MSC may be a useful source of paracrine factors that protect RGC and stimulate regeneration of their axons in the optic nerve in degenerate eye disease.

In this review, we focus on the role of cadherin mediated signaling in development and stem cell differentiation, with emphasis on two well-known cadherins, cadherin-2 (CDH2) (N-cadherin) and cadherin-11 (CDH11) (OB-cadherin). We summarize the existing knowledge regarding the role of CDH2 and CDH11 during development and differentiation in vivo and in vitro. We also discuss engineering strategies to control stem cell fate decisions by fine-tuning the extent of cell\u2013cell adhesion through surface chemistry and microtopology. These studies may be greatly facilitated by novel strategies that enable monitoring of stem cell specification in real time. We expect that better understanding of how intercellular adhesion signaling affects lineage specification may impact biomaterial and scaffold design to control stem cell fate decisions in three-dimensional context with potential implications for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",

The differences between human gallbladder and intrahepatic bile duct (IHBD) cells have also not been explored. The goals of this study were to evaluate if human fetal gallbladder contains a candidate stem cell population and if fetal gallbladder cells are distinct from fetal IHBD cells. We found that EpCAM+CD44+CD13\u00a0+ cells represent the cell population most enriched for clonal self-renewal from primary gallbladder. Primary EpCAM+CD44+CD13\u00a0+ cells gave rise to EpCAM+CD44+CD13\u00a0+ and EpCAM+CD44+CD13\u00a0\u2212 cells in vitro, and gallbladder cells expanded in vitro exhibited short-term engraftment in vivo. Last, we found that CD13, CD227, CD66, CD26 and CD49b were differentially expressed between gallbladder and IHBD cells cultured in vitro indicating clear phenotypic differences between the two cell populations. Microarray analyses of expanded cultures confirmed that both cell types have unique transcriptional profiles with predicted functional differences in lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid and drug metabolism.In conclusion, we have isolated a distinct clonogenic population of epithelial cells from primary human fetal gallbladder with stem cell characteristics and found it to be unique compared to IHBD cells.",

The current work further investigates the roles of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) and Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) in hydrostatic pressure-related effects on BMSCs. Flow cytometry assays showed that the hydrostatic pressure promoted cell cycle initiation in a RhoA- and Rac1-dependent manner. Furthermore, fluorescence assays confirmed that RhoA played a positive and Rac1 displayed a negative role in the hydrostatic pressure-induced F-actin stress fiber assembly. Western blots suggested that RhoA and Rac1 play central roles in the pressure-inhibited ERK phosphorylation, and Rac1 but not RhoA was involved in the pressure-promoted JNK phosphorylation. Finally, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments showed that pressure promoted the expression of osteogenic marker genes in BMSCs at an early stage of osteogenic differentiation through the up-regulation of RhoA activity. Additionally, the PCR results showed that pressure enhanced the expression of chondrogenic marker genes in BMSCs during chondrogenic differentiation via the up-regulation of Rac1 activity. Collectively, our results suggested that RhoA and Rac1 are critical to the pressure-induced proliferation and differentiation, the stress fiber assembly, and MAPK activation in BMSCs.",

In this study, we analyzed the role of G-protein coupled receptor 56 (Gpr56) as a candidate HSC regulator based on its differential expression in quiescent relative to proliferating HSCs and its common targeting by core HSC regulators. Detailed expression analysis revealed that Gpr56 is abundantly expressed by HSPCs during definitive hematopoiesis in the embryo and in the adult bone marrow, but its levels are reduced substantially as HSPCs differentiate. However, despite enriched expression in HSPCs, Gpr56-deficiency did not impair HSPC maintenance or function during steady-state or myeloablative stress-induced hematopoiesis. Gpr56-deficient HSCs also responded normally to physiological and pharmacological mobilization signals, despite the reported role of this GPCR as a regulator of cell adhesion and migration in neuronal cells. Moreover, Gpr56-deficient bone marrow engrafted with equivalent efficiency as wild-type HSCs in primary recipients; however, their reconstituting ability was reduced when subjected to serial transplantation. These data indicate that although GPR56 is abundantly and selectively expressed by primitive HSPCs, its high level expression is largely dispensable for steady-state and regenerative hematopoiesis.",

Quantitative proteomic comparison revealed approximately 220 proteins commonly up-regulated in all three pluripotent stem cell lines compared to the primary cells.

Understanding how toxicants disrupt spermatogenesis is critical for determining how environmental factors contribute to impaired fertility. While current animal models are available, understanding of the reproductive toxic effects on human fertility requires a more robust model system. We recently demonstrated that human pluripotent stem cells can differentiate into spermatogonial stem cells/spermatogonia, primary and secondary spermatocytes, and haploid spermatids; a model that mimics many aspects of human spermatogenesis. Here, using this model system, we examine the effects of 2-bromopropane (2-BP) and 1,2,dibromo-3-chloropropane (DBCP) on in vitro human spermatogenesis. 2-BP and DBCP are non-endocrine disrupting toxicants that are known to impact male fertility. We show that acute treatment with either 2-BP or DBCP induces a reduction in germ cell viability through apoptosis. 2-BP and DBCP affect viability of different cell populations as 2-BP primarily reduces spermatocyte viability, whereas DBCP exerts a much greater effect on spermatogonia. Acute treatment with 2-BP or DBCP also reduces the percentage of haploid spermatids. Both 2-BP and DBCP induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation leading to an oxidized cellular environment. Taken together, these results suggest that acute exposure with 2-BP or DBCP causes human germ cell death in vitro by inducing ROS formation. This system represents a unique platform for assessing human reproductive toxicity potential of various environmental toxicants in a rapid, efficient, and unbiased format.",

Here, we show that canonical Wnt signals distinctively regulate MSCs in a biphasic manner depending on signal intensity, i.e., MSCs exhibit proliferation and progenitor self-renewal under low Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling, whereas they exhibit enhanced osteogenic differentiation with priming to osteoblast-like lineages under high Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling. Moreover, low or high levels of \u03b2-catenin in MSCs distinctly regulated the hematopoietic support of MSCs to promote proliferation or the undifferentiated state of hematopoietic progenitors, respectively. A gene expression study demonstrated that different intracellular levels of \u03b2-catenin in MSCs induce distinct transcriptomic changes in subsets of genes belonging to different gene function categories. Different \u03b2-catenin levels also induced differences in intracellular levels of the \u03b2-catenin co-factors, Tcf-1 and Lef-1. Moreover, nano-scale mass spectrometry of proteins that co-precipitated with \u03b2-catenin revealed distinctive spectra of proteins selectively interacting with \u03b2-catenin at specific expression levels. Together, these results show that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signals can coax distinct transcription milieu to induce different transcription profiles in MSCs depending on the signal intensity and that fine-tuning of the canonical Wnt signaling intensity can regulate the phase-specific functionality of MSCs.",

Taurine is a free amino acid found in numerous diets, with anti-inflammatory properties. Although abundant in the young brain, the decrease in taurine concentration with age may underlie reduced neurogenesis. Here, we assessed the effect of taurine on hippocampal neurogenesis in middle-aged mice. We found that taurine increased cell proliferation in the dentate gyrus through the activation of quiescent stem cells, resulting in increased number of stem cells and intermediate neural progenitors. Taurine had a direct effect on stem/progenitor cells proliferation, as observed in vitro, and also reduced activated microglia. Furthermore, taurine increased the survival of newborn neurons, resulting in a net increase in adult neurogenesis. Together, these results show that taurine increases several steps of adult neurogenesis and support a beneficial role of taurine on hippocampal neurogenesis in the context of brain aging.",

Non-adherent CD133+ EFCs isolated from human umbilical cord blood and cultured under different conditions were maximally expanded by day 12 in the presence of IL3 at which time a 350-fold increase in cell number was obtained. Cell surface marker phenotyping confirmed expression of the hematopoietic progenitor cell markers CD133, CD117 and CD34, vascular cell markers VEGFR2 and CD31, dim expression of CD45 and absence of myeloid markers CD14 and CD11b. Functional experiments revealed that EXnaEFCs exhibited classical properties of endothelial cells (ECs), namely binding of Ulex europaeus lectin, up-take of acetylated-low density lipoprotein and contribution to EC tube formation in vitro. These EXnaEFCs demonstrated a pro-angiogenic phenotype within two independent in vivo rodent models. Firstly, a Matrigel plug assay showed increased vascularisation in mice. Secondly, a rat model of acute myocardial infarction demonstrated reduced heart damage as determined by lower levels of serum creatinine and a modest increase in heart functionality. Taken together, these studies show IL3 as a potent growth factor for human CD133+ cell expansion with clear pro-angiogenic properties (in vitro and in vivo) and thus may provide clinical utility for humans in the future.",

To determine differences between clonogenic multipotent SSCs and similarly clonogenic but non-multipotent BMSCs, we established single colony-derived strains (SCDSs, initiated by individual Colony Forming Unit-Fibroblasts) and determined their differentiation capacity by vivo transplantation. In this series of human SCDSs (N\u00a0=\u00a024), 20.8% formed fibrous tissue (F), 66.7% formed bone (B), and 12.5% formed a bone/marrow organ, and thus were multipotent (M). RNA isolated from 12 SCDSs just prior to transplantation was analyzed by microarray. Although highly similar, there was variability from one SCDS to another, and SCDSs did not strictly segregate into the three functional groups (F, B or M) by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. We then compared 3 F-SCDSs to 3 M-SCDSs that did segregate. Genes associated with skeletogenesis, osteoblastogeneis, hematopoiesis, and extracellular matrix were over-represented in M-SCDSs compared with F-SCDSs. These results highlight the heterogeneity of SSCs/BMSCs, even between functionally similar SCDSs, but also indicate that differences can be detected that may shed light on the character of the SSC.",

Successful myelination depends on the control of adhesiveness during OPC migration and axon contact formation. The decoration of cell surface proteins with the glycan polysialic acid (polySia) is a key regulatory element of OPC interactions during development and under pathological conditions. By far the major protein carrier of polySia is the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, but recently, polysialylation of the synaptic cell adhesion molecule SynCAM 1 has been detected in the developing mouse brain. In mice, polySia-SynCAM 1 is associated with cells expressing NG2, a marker of a heterogeneous precursor cell population, which is the primary source for oligodendrocytes in development and myelin repair but can also give rise to astrocytes and possibly neurons. It is not yet clear if polySia-SynCAM 1 is expressed by OPCs and its occurrence in humans is elusive. By generating uniform human embryonic stem cell-derived OPC cultures, we demonstrate that polySia is present on human OPCs but down-regulated during differentiation into myelin basic protein-positive oligodendrocytes. PolySia on NCAM resides on the isoforms NCAM-180 and NCAM-140, and SynCAM 1 is identified as a novel polySia acceptor in human OPCs.",

Here we examined the potential role of the PDZ motif in CXCR2-mediated EPC motility and angiogenesis. We observed that exogenous CXCR2 C-tail significantly inhibited in vitro EPC migratory responses and angiogenic activities, as well as in vivo EPC angiogenesis. However, the CXCR2 C-tail that lacks the PDZ motif (\u0394TTL) did not cause any significant changes of these functions in EPCs. In addition, using biochemical assays, we demonstrated that the PDZ scaffold protein NHERF1 specifically interacted with CXCR2 and its downstream effector, PLC-\u03b23, in EPCs. This suggests that NHERF1 might cluster CXCR2 and its relevant signaling molecules into a macromolecular signaling complex modulating EPC cellular functions.

Previous searches for biomarkers expressed specifically in DSCs were hampered by difficulty obtaining pure DSCs and by the challenges in mining complex molecular expression data. To identify such useful and specific DSC biomarkers, we combined a novel sparse feature selection method with combinatorial molecular expression data focused on asymmetric self-renewal, a conspicuous property of DSCs.

Mechanical stretching plays a vital role in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of BMSCs. However, little is known about the effects of cyclic stretching on BMSC migration and invasion. In this study, using a custom-made cell-stretching device, we studied the effects of cyclic mechanical stretching on rat BMSC migration and invasion using a Transwell Boyden Chamber. The protein secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) was detected by gelatin zymography, and the activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase1/2 (ERK1/2) was measured by western blot. We found that cyclic mechanical stretching with 10% amplitude at 1\u00a0Hz frequency for 8\u00a0h promotes BMSC migration, but reduces BMSC invasion. FAK and ERK1/2 signals were activated in BMSCs after exposure to cyclic stretching. In the presence of the FAK phosphorylation blocker PF573228 or the ERK1/2 phosphorylation blocker PD98059, the cyclic-stretch-promoted migration of BMSCs was completely suppressed. On the other hand, cyclic mechanical stretching reduced the secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in BMSCs, and PF573228 suppressed the cyclic-stretch-reduced secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9. The decrease of BMSC invasion induced by mechanical stretching is partially restored by PF573228 but remained unaffected by PD98059. Taken together, these data show that cyclic mechanical stretching promotes BMSC migration via the FAK-ERK1/2 signalling pathway, but reduces BMSC invasion by decreasing secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 via FAK, independent of the ERK1/2 signal.",

We differentiated a hESC line, KhES-3, into pancreatic lineages with a stepwise protocol recapitulating developmental process. The induction rate of PDX1+NKX6.1+ cells was correlated with cell density in adherent cultures, and markedly improved with cell aggregation cultures. The positive effects of cell aggregation cultures on the differentiation of pancreatic bud cells were reproduced in multiple hESC/iPSC lines. The human PDX1+NKX6.1+ cells developed into pancreatic epithelia after implantation into immunocompromised mice.

However, the mechanism of miRNA involvement in the sphere formation and neural differentiation abilities of cancer stem-like cells is poorly understood.We found that miRNA-30c could assist in sphere formation of C6 cells under defined conditions in neural stem cell medium DMEM/F12-bFGF-EGF-B27. Moreover, overexpression of miRNA-30c might reduce 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX)-induced neural differentiation, as the expression of neural markers, especially glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), decreased. Further experiments revealed that miRNA-30c inhibited the IBMX-induced astrocyte differentiation via targeting the upstream genes and inactivating phosphorylation of STAT3 of the JAK-STAT3 pathway. Subsequently, the expression of GFAP was reduced and the number of astrocyte differentiation from C6 cells decreased.Our findings suggest that miRNA-30c could play a regulatory role in self-renewal and neural differentiation in C6 glioma cells.",

     "abstract": "A common challenge in avian cell biology is the generation of differentiated cell-lines, especially in the keratinocyte lineage. Only a few avian cell-lines are available and very few of them show an interesting differentiation profile. During the last decade, mammalian embryonic stem cell-lines were shown to differentiate into almost all lineages, including keratinocytes. Although chicken embryonic stem cells had been obtained in the 1990s, few differentiation studies toward the ectodermal lineage were reported. Consequently, we explored the differentiation of chicken embryonic stem cells toward the keratinocyte lineage by using a combination of stromal induction, ascorbic acid, BMP4 and chicken serum. During the induction period, we observed a downregulation of pluripotency markers and an upregulation of epidermal markers. Three homogenous cell populations were derived, which were morphologically similar to chicken primary keratinocytes, displaying intracellular lipid droplets in almost every pavimentous cell. These cells could be serially passaged without alteration of their morphology and showed gene and protein expression profiles of epidermal markers similar to chicken primary keratinocytes. These cells represent an alternative to the isolation of chicken primary keratinocytes, being less cumbersome to handle and reducing the number of experimental animals used for the preparation of primary cells.",

The patient BMSCs had lower proliferative activity than that of the controls due to increased senescence. This retarded proliferation induced failure to obtain enough metaphase cells for karyotyping in patient BMSCs (10%). Patient BMSCs were genetically altered which was demonstrated by chromosome abnormalities in 5% of the patients (one MDS and three AML), whereas no clonal abnormalities were detected in the controls. The most common abnormality of the BMSCs was an extra chromosome 5, followed by an extra chromosome 7 and balanced translocations. The proportion of the abnormal metaphase cells was low (17.8%). We also analyzed the epigenetic changes of long interspersed nucleotide element 1 (LINE-1) repetitive element and CDKN2B using pyrosequencing. The quantitative measurement of global LINE-1 methylation demonstrated that patient BMSCs revealed global hypomethylation (68.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8) compared with controls (72.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.4, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and that the global hypomethylation of BMSCs were more significant in AML than in MDS patients (67.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.8, 69.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.2, respectively).

After it was introduced, experimental evidence both in favor and against the hypothesis has been presented.Using a novel methodology that utilizes cancer sequencing data we are able to estimate the rate of accumulation of mutations in healthy stem cells of the colon, blood and head and neck tissues. We find that in these tissues mutations in stem cells accumulate at rates strikingly similar to those expected without the protection from the immortal strand mechanism.Utilizing an approach that is fundamentally different from previous efforts to confirm or refute the immortal strand hypothesis, we provide evidence against non-random segregation of DNA during stem cell replication.

To determine whether KLF5 regulates proliferation of intestinal stem cells, we investigated the effects of Klf5 deletion specifically from the intestinal stem cells in adult mice. Mice with inducible intestinal stem cell-specific deletion of Klf5 (Lgr5-Klf5fl/fl) were injected with tamoxifen for 5 consecutive days to induce Lgr5-driven Cre expression. Intestinal and colonic tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry at various time points up to 112\u00a0days following start of tamoxifen treatment. Klf5 is co-localized in the crypt-based columnar (CBC) cells that express Lgr5. By 11\u00a0days following the start of tamoxifen treatment, Lgr5-positive crypts from which Klf5 was deleted exhibited a loss of proliferation that was accompanied by an increase in apoptosis. Beginning at 14\u00a0days following the start of tamoxifen treatment, both Klf5 expression and proliferation were re-established in the transit-amplifying epithelial cells but not in the Lgr5-positive CBC cells. By 112\u00a0days post-treatment, up to 90% of the Lgr5-positive cells from which Klf5 was deleted were lost from the intestinal crypts.

The function of skeletal muscle stem cells resident in dystrophic muscle may be perturbed by being in an increasing pathogenic environment, coupled with constant demands for repairing muscle. To investigate the contribution of satellite cell exhaustion to this process, we tested the functionality of satellite cells isolated from the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We found that satellite cells derived from young mdx mice contributed efficiently to muscle regeneration within our in vivo mouse model. To then test the effects of long-term residence in a dystrophic environment, satellite cells were isolated from aged mdx muscle. Surprisingly, they were as functional as those derived from young or aged wild type donors. Removing satellite cells from a dystrophic milieu reveals that their regenerative capacity remains both intact and similar to satellite cells derived from healthy muscle, indicating that the host environment is critical for controlling satellite cell function.",

However, a detailed characterization of the epithelial transition associated with the acquisition of a pluripotent phenotype is still lacking to this date.Here, we integrate a panel of morphological approaches with gene expression analyses to visualize the dynamics of episomal reprogramming of human fibroblasts to iPSCs. We provide the first ultrastructural analysis of human fibroblasts at various stages of episomal iPSC reprogramming, as well as the first real-time live cell visualization of a MET occurring during reprogramming. The results indicate that the MET manifests itself approximately 6\u201312\u00a0days after electroporation, in synchrony with the upregulation of early pluripotency markers, and resembles a reversal of the Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) which takes place during mammalian gastrulation.",

Mouse lines derived from the early blastocyst and from primordial germ cells (PGCs) can contribute to all somatic lineages and to the germ line, whereas cells from slightly later embryos (EpiSC) no longer contribute to the germ line. In chick, pluripotent ESCs can be obtained from PGCs and from early blastoderms. Established PGC lines and freshly isolated blastodermal cells (cBC) can contribute to both germinal and somatic lineages but established lines from the former (cESC) can only produce somatic cell types. For this reason, cESCs are often considered to be equivalent to mouse EpiSC. To define these cell types more rigorously, we have performed comparative microarray analysis to describe a transcriptomic profile specific for each cell type. This is validated by real time RT-PCR and in situ hybridisation. We find that both cES and cBC cells express classic pluripotency-related genes (including cPOUV/OCT4, NANOG, SOX2/3, KLF2 and SALL4), whereas expression of DAZL, DND1, DDX4 and PIWIL1 defines a molecular signature for germ cells.

In this study, cultured NPCs were prepared from adult or embryo cortex, and were maintained as either proliferating NPCs or differentiated cells in vitro. Analysis using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, Western blot and lectin blot revealed that GnT-V and its reaction products were distinctly expressed in proliferating NPCs; moreover expression of GnT-V and its reaction products were markedly diminished in differentiated cells. In brain slices, many GnT-V-positive neurogenic cells were detected throughout the cerebral cortex on embryonic day 13, while only a few doublecortin (Dcx)- and GnT-V-double positive NPCs were detected around the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle in the adult brain. However, in the mice in which motor function was spontaneously recovered after cryoinjury to the motor cortex, many Dcx- and GnT-V-double positive NPCs were found to have accumulated around the brain lesion of the adult cerebral cortex compared with the mice in which the function did not recover. These results indicate that GnT-V expression is under rigorous control during NPC differentiation. Furthermore, expression of GnT-V and its reaction products in NPCs may be necessary for the functional recovery after brain injury, and could be used as a marker for visualization of NPCs.",

To examine the function of this signaling pathway in the intact nervous system, we developed a transgenic mouse model in which noggin expression can be induced specifically in NSC via a nestin-driven reverse tetracycline-controlled transactivator (rtTA). In adult animals, the induction of noggin expression promotes the proliferation of neural progenitors in the SVZ, and shifts the differentiation of B cells (NSC) from mature astrocytes to transit amplifying C cells and oligodendrocyte precursor cells without depleting the NSC population. Noggin expression significantly increases neuronal and oligodendrocyte differentiation both in vivo and in vitro when NSCs are grown as neurospheres.

Four samples showed CD34+CD38\u2212 predominance, and four were predominantly CD34+CD38+. CD34+ CD38\u2212 predominant leukemia cells maintained the CD34+ CD38\u2212 phenotype and were viable for 6\u00a0weeks when co-cultured with MSCs compared to co-cultures with cytokines or medium only, which showed rapid differentiation and loss of the LSC phenotype. In contrast, CD34+ CD38+ predominant leukemic cells maintained the CD34+CD38+ phenotype when co-cultured with MSCs alone, but no culture conditions supported survival beyond 4\u00a0weeks. Cell cycle analysis showed that MSCs maintained a higher proportion of CD34+ blasts in G0 than leukemic cells cultured with cytokines. AML blasts maintained in culture with MSCs for up to 6\u00a0weeks engrafted NSG mice with the same efficiency as their non-cultured counterparts, and the original karyotype persisted after co-culture. Chemosensitivity and transwell assays suggest that MSCs provide pro-survival benefits to leukemic blasts through cell\u2013cell contact.

Since epigenetic modifications are dynamic, we have developed an original ex vivo approach to study the expression and epigenetic profiles of key genes associated with either intestinal cell pluripotency or differentiation by isolating cryosections of the intestinal crypt-villus axis. Gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modifications were studied by qRT-PCR, methylation-specific PCR and micro-chromatin immunoprecipitation, respectively. Using this approach, it was possible to identify segment-specific methylation and chromatin profiles. We show that (i) expression of intestinal stem cell markers (Lgr5, Ascl2) exclusively in the crypt is associated with active histone marks, (ii) promoters of all pluripotency genes studied and transcription factors involved in intestinal cell fate (Cdx2) harbour a bivalent chromatin pattern in the crypts and (iii) expression of differentiation markers (Muc2, Sox9) along the crypt-villus axis is associated with DNA methylation. Hence, using an original model of cryosectioning along the crypt-villus axis that allows in situ detection of dynamic epigenetic modifications, we demonstrate that regulation of pluripotency and differentiation markers in healthy intestinal mucosa involves different and specific epigenetic mechanisms.",

Urodele amphibians and teleosts are well-known examples of such animals that can efficiently regenerate various organs including the heart as adults. By understanding how these animals regenerate a damaged heart, one might obtain valuable insights into how regeneration can be augmented in injured human hearts.

Here we review the role of thyroid hormone in postnatal cardiac development, given recent insights into its role in stimulating a burst of cardiomyocyte proliferation in the murine heart in preadolescence; a response required to meet the massive increase in circulatory demand predicated by an almost quadrupling of body weight during a period of about 21\u00a0days from birth to adolescence. Importantly, thyroid hormone metabolism is altered by chronic diseases, such as heart failure and ischemic heart disease, as well as in very sick children requiring surgery for congenital heart diseases, which results in low T3 syndrome that impairs cardiovascular function and is associated with a poor prognosis. Therapy with T3 or thyroid hormone analogs has been shown to improve cardiac contractility; however, the mechanism is as yet unknown. Given the postnatal cardiomyocyte mitogenic potential of T3, its ability to enhance cardiac function by promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation warrants further consideration.",

     "abstract": "Resident cardiac stem cells in embryonic, neonatal and adult mammalian heart have been identified by different membrane markers and transcription factors. However, despite a flurry of publications no consensus has been reached on the identity and actual regenerative effects of the adult cardiac stem cells. Intensive research on the adult mammalian heart's capacity for self-renewal of its muscle cell mass has led to a consensus that new cardiomyocytes (CMs) are indeed formed throughout adult mammalian life albeit at a disputed frequency. The physiological significance of this renewal, the origin of the new CMs, and the rate of adult CM turnover are still highly debated. Myocyte replacement, particularly after injury, was originally attributed to differentiation of a stem cell compartment. More recently, it has been reported that CMs are mainly replaced by the division of pre-existing post-mitotic CMs. These latter results, if confirmed, would shift the target of regenerative therapy toward boosting mature CM cell-cycle re-entry. Despite this controversy, it is documented that the adult endogenous c-kitpos cardiac stem cells (c-kitpos eCSCs) participate in adaptations to myocardial stress, and, when transplanted into the myocardium, regenerate most cardiomyocytes and microvasculature lost in an infarct. Nevertheless, the in situ myogenic potential of adult c-kitpos cardiac cells has been questioned. To revisit the regenerative potential of c-kitpos eCSCs, we have recently employed experimental protocols of severe diffuse myocardial damage in combination with several genetic murine models and cell transplantation approaches showing that eCSCs are necessary and sufficient for CM regeneration, leading to complete cellular, anatomical, and functional myocardial recovery. Here we will review the available data on adult eCSC biology and their regenerative potential placing it in the context of the different claimed mechanisms of CM replacement. These data are in agreement with and have reinforced our view that most CMs are replaced by de novo CM formation through the activation, myogenic commitment and specification of the eCSC cohort.",

Using ApcMin/+ mice as a source of organoids we documented their transition, on a clone-by-clone basis, to cyst-like spheres with constitutively activated Wnt pathway, increased self-renewal and growth and reduced differentiation. We then looked at this transition when Myb and/or Notch1 are activated. Activated Notch promoted cyst-like organoids. Conversely growth and propagation of cyst-like, but not normal organoids were Notch-independent. Activated Myb promoted normal, but not cyst-like organoids. Interestingly the Wnt, Notch and Myb pathways were all involved in regulating the expression of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) gene Lgr5 in organoids, while ISC gene and Notch target Olfm4 was dominantly repressed by Wnt. These findings parallel mouse intestinal adenoma formation where Notch promoted the initiation, but not growth, of Wnt-driven Olfm4-repressed colon tumors. Also Myb was essential for colon tumor initiation and collateral mouse pathologies.

SOX18 induces ASCs to express a set of genes involved in vascular patterning: MMP7, KDR, EFNB2, SEMA3G and CXCR4. Accordingly, SOX18 transduced ASCs reorganize under conditions of shear stress, display VEGF-induced chemotaxis and form tubular structures in 3D matrices in an MMP7-dependent manner.

In the past decade, great progress has been made on the cell culture conditions, transcription factor programs and intracellular signaling pathways that control both murine and human ES cell fates. ES cells of mouse vs. human origin have distinct culture conditions, responding to some tyrosine kinase signaling pathways in opposite ways. Previous work has implicated the Src family of non-receptor protein\u2013tyrosine kinases in mouse ES cell self-renewal and differentiation. Seven members of the Src kinase family are expressed in mouse ES cells, and individual family members appear to play distinct roles in regulating their developmental fate. Both Hck and c-Yes are important in self-renewal, while c-Src activity alone is sufficient to induce differentiation. While these findings implicate Src-family kinase signaling in mouse ES cell renewal and differentiation, the role of this kinase family in human ES cells is largely unknown. Here, we explored Src-family kinase expression patterns and signaling in human ES cells during self-renewal and differentiation. Of the eleven Src-related kinases in the human genome, Fyn, c-Yes, c-Src, Lyn, Lck and Hck were expressed in H1, H7 and H9 hES cells, while Fgr, Blk, Srm, Brk, and Frk transcripts were not detected. Of these, c-Yes, Lyn, and Hck transcript levels remained constant in self-renewing human ES cells vs. differentiated EBs, while c-Src and Fyn showed a modest increase in expression as a function of differentiation. In contrast, Lck expression levels dropped dramatically as a function of EB differentiation. To assess the role of overall Src-family kinase activity in human ES cell differentiation, cultures were treated with inhibitors specific for the Src kinase family. Remarkably, human ES cells maintained in the presence of the potent Src-family kinase inhibitor A-419259 retained the morphology of domed, pluripotent colonies and continued to express the self-renewal marker TRA-1-60 despite culture under differentiation conditions. Taken together, these observations support a role for Src-family kinase signaling in the regulation of human ES cell fate, and suggest that the activities of individual Src-family members are required for the initiation of the differentiation program.",

The use of embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cardiomyocytes as transplantable heart muscle cells has been proposed as a solution, but is limited by the lack of understanding of the developmental pathways leading to specification of cardiac progenitors. Identification of these pathways will enhance the ability to differentiate cardiomyocytes into a clinical source of transplantable cells. Here, we show that the mRNA 3\u2032 end processing protein, CstF-64, is essential for cardiomyocyte differentiation in mouse ESCs. Loss of CstF-64 in mouse ESCs results in loss of differentiation potential \u00a0toward the endodermal lineage. However, CstF-64 knockout (Cstf2E6) cells were able to differentiate into neuronal progenitors, demonstrating that some differentiation pathways were still intact. Markers for mesodermal differentiation were also present, although Cstf2E6 cells were defective in forming beating cardiomyocytes and expressing cardiac specific markers. Since the extraembryonic endoderm is needed for cardiomyocyte differentiation and endodermal markers were decreased, we hypothesized that endodermal factors were required for efficient cardiomyocyte formation in the Cstf2E6 cells. Using conditioned medium from the extraembryonic endodermal (XEN) stem cell line we were able to restore cardiomyocyte differentiation in Cstf2E6 cells, suggesting that CstF-64 has a role in regulating endoderm differentiation that is necessary for cardiac specification and that extraembryonic endoderm signaling is essential for cardiomyocyte development.",

Of the differentiated lineages available to trophoblast stem cells (TSC), elevated O2 and mitochondrial function are necessary to placental lineages at the maternal\u2013placental surface and important in the etiology of preeclampsia. TSC lineage imbalance leads to embryonic failure during uterine implantation. Stress at implantation exacerbates stem cell depletion by decreasing proliferation and increasing differentiation. In an implantation site O2 is normally ~\u00a02%. In culture, exposure to 2% O2 and fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) enabled the highest mouse TSC multipotency and proliferation. In contrast, hypoxic stress (0.5% O2) initiated the most TSC differentiation after 24\u00a0h despite exposure to FGF4. However, hypoxic stress supported differentiation poorly after 4\u20137\u00a0days, despite FGF4 removal. At all tested O2 levels, FGF4 maintained Warburg metabolism; mitochondrial inactivity and aerobic glycolysis. However, hypoxic stress suppressed mitochondrial membrane potential and maintained low mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (oxidative phosphorylation/OxPhos), and high pyruvate kinase M2 (glycolysis) despite FGF4 removal. Inhibiting OxPhos inhibited optimum differentiation at 20% O2. Moreover, adding differentiation-inducing hyperosmolar stress failed to induce differentiation during hypoxia. Thus, differentiation depended on OxPhos at 20% O2; hypoxic and hyperosmolar stresses did not induce differentiation at 0.5% O2. Hypoxia-limited differentiation and mitochondrial inhibition and activation suggest that differentiation into two lineages of the labyrinthine placenta requires O2\u00a0>\u00a00.5\u20132% and mitochondrial function. Stress-activated protein kinase increases an early lineage and suppresses later lineages in proportion to the deviation from optimal O2 for multipotency, thus it is the first enzyme reported to prioritize differentiation.",

     "abstract": "The loss of genome integrity in adult stem cells results in accelerated tissue aging and is possibly cancerogenic. Adult stem cells in different tissues appear to react robustly to DNA damage. We report that adult skeletal stem (satellite) cells do not primarily respond to radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) via differentiation and exhibit less apoptosis compared to other myogenic cells. Satellite cells repair these DNA lesions more efficiently than their committed progeny. Importantly, non-proliferating satellite cells and post-mitotic nuclei in the fiber exhibit dramatically distinct repair efficiencies. Altogether, reduction of the repair capacity appears to be more a function of differentiation than of the proliferation status of the muscle cell. Notably, satellite cells retain a high efficiency of DSB repair also when isolated from the natural niche. Finally, we show that repair of DSB substrates is not only very efficient but, surprisingly, also very accurate in satellite cells and that accurate repair depends on the key non-homologous end-joining factor DNA-PKcs.",

The use of this approach is challenged by the difficulty in maintaining these cells ex vivo while keeping their myogenic potential, and ensuring sufficient transgene expression following their transplantation and myogenic differentiation in vivo. We investigated the use of the piggyBac transposon system to achieve stable gene expression when transferred to cultured mesoangioblasts and into murine muscles. Without selection, up to 8% of the mesoangioblasts expressed the transgene from 1 to 2 genomic copies of the piggyBac vector. Integration occurred mostly in intergenic genomic DNA and transgene expression was stable in vitro. Intramuscular transplantation of mouse Tibialis anterior muscles with mesoangioblasts containing the transposon led to sustained myofiber GFP expression in vivo. In contrast, the direct electroporation of the transposon-donor plasmids in the mouse Tibialis muscles in vivo did not lead to sustained transgene expression despite molecular evidence of piggyBac transposition in vivo.

Here, we set out to decipher the differences between these Lrig1 antibodies to clarify their use for Lrig1-related studies. We confirmed that the commercially available Lrig1-R&D antibody stained the bottom third of the colonic crypt, whereas an independently generated Lrig1-VU antibody recognized a subset of anti-Lrig1-R&D+ cells. Biochemically, we found that anti-Lrig1-VU recognized a non-glycosylated form of Lrig1; in contrast, anti-Lrig1-R&D recognized both glycosylated and non-glycosylated forms of Lrig1. In addition, we generated a reporter mouse (Lrig1-Apple) as an independent readout of Lrig1 transcriptional activity. Flow cytometry of isolated colonic epithelial cells from Lrig1-Apple mice demonstrated anti-Lrig1-R&D recognized mostly RFP-hi cells, while anti-Lrig1-VU recognized cells that were largely RFP-mid. Of note, by qRT-PCR, Lgr5 was expressed in the RFP-hi population, but not in the RFP-mid population.

     "abstract": "Mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is a potent promoter of tissue growth and regeneration, whilst unloading in microgravity can cause reduced tissue regeneration, possibly through effects on stem cell tissue progenitors. To test the specific hypothesis that mechanical unloading alters differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell lineages, we studied cellular and molecular aspects of how bone marrow in the mouse proximal femur responds to unloading in microgravity. Trabecular and cortical endosteal bone surfaces in the femoral head underwent significant bone resorption in microgravity, enlarging the marrow cavity. Cells isolated from the femoral head marrow compartment showed significant down-regulation of gene expression markers for early mesenchymal and hematopoietic differentiation, including FUT1(\u2212\u00a06.72), CSF2(\u2212\u00a03.30), CD90(\u2212\u00a03.33), PTPRC(\u2212\u00a02.79), and GDF15(\u2212\u00a02.45), but not stem cell markers, such as SOX2. At the cellular level, in situ histological analysis revealed decreased megakaryocyte numbers whilst erythrocytes were increased 2.33 fold. Furthermore, erythrocytes displayed elevated fucosylation and clustering adjacent to sinuses forming the marrow\u2013blood barrier, possibly providing a mechanistic basis for explaining spaceflight anemia. Culture of isolated bone marrow cells immediately after microgravity exposure increased the marrow progenitor's potential for mesenchymal differentiation into in-vitro mineralized bone nodules, and hematopoietic differentiation into osteoclasts, suggesting an accumulation of undifferentiated progenitors during exposure to microgravity. These results support the idea that mechanical unloading of mammalian tissues in microgravity is a strong inhibitor of tissue growth and regeneration mechanisms, acting at the level of early mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cell differentiation.",

     "abstract": "The development of novel platforms for large scale production of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) derived cardiomyocytes (CM) becomes more crucial as the demand for CMs in preclinical trials, high throughput cardio toxicity assays and future regenerative therapeutics rises. To this end, we have designed a microcarrier (MC) suspension agitated platform that integrates pluripotent hESC expansion followed by CM differentiation in a continuous, homogenous process.Hydrodynamic shear stresses applied during the hESC expansion and CM differentiation steps drastically reduced the capability of the cells to differentiate into CMs. Applying vigorous stirring during pluripotent hESC expansion on Cytodex 1 MC in spinner cultures resulted in low CM yields in the following differentiation step (cardiac troponin-T (cTnT): 22.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.56%; myosin heavy chain (MHC): 19.30\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.31%). Whereas the lower shear experienced in side to side rocker (wave type) platform resulted in higher CM yields (cTNT: 47.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.35%; MHC: 42.85\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.64%). The efficiency of CM differentiation is also affected by the hydrodynamic shear stress applied during the first 3\u00a0days of the differentiation stage. Even low shear applied continuously by side to side rocker agitation resulted in very low CM differentiation efficiency (cTnT\u00a0<\u00a05%; MHC\u00a0<\u00a02%). Simply by applying intermittent agitation during these 3\u00a0days followed by continuous agitation for the subsequent 9\u00a0days, CM differentiation efficiency can be substantially increased (cTNT: 65.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.73%; MHC: 59.73\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.17%). These yields are 38.3% and 39.3% higher (for cTnT and MHC respectively) than static culture control.During the hESC expansion phase, cells grew on continuously agitated rocker platform as pluripotent cell/MC aggregates (166\u00a0\u00b1\u00a088\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0105\u00a0\u03bcm2) achieving a cell concentration of 3.74\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.55\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells/mL (18.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.82 fold expansion) in 7\u00a0days. These aggregates were further differentiated into CMs using a WNT modulation differentiation protocol for the subsequent 12\u00a0days on a rocking platform with an intermittent agitation regime during the first 3\u00a0days. Collectively, the integrated MC rocker platform produced 190.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a058.8\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 CMs per run (31.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.74 CM/hESC seeded). The robustness of the system was demonstrated by using 2 cells lines, hESC (HES-3) and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) IMR-90. The CM/MC aggregates formed extensive sarcomeres that exhibited cross-striations confirming cardiac ontogeny. Functionality of the CMs was demonstrated by monitoring the effect of inotropic drug, Isoproterenol on beating frequency.In conclusion, we have developed a simple robust and scalable platform that integrates both hESC expansion and CM differentiation in one unit process which is capable of meeting the need for large amounts of CMs.",

     "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifocal disease, and precursor cells need to migrate into the multiple lesions in order to exert their therapeutic effects. Therefore, cell migration is a crucial element in regenerative processes in MS, dictating the route of delivery, when cell transplantation is considered. We have previously shown that inflammation triggers migration of multi-potential neural precursor cells (NPCs) into the white matter of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rodents, a widely used model of MS. Here we investigated the molecular basis of this attraction.NPCs were grown from E13 embryonic mouse brains and transplanted into the lateral cerebral ventricles of EAE mice. Transplanted NPC migration was directed by three tissue-derived chemokines. Stromal cell-derived factor-1\u03b1, monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 and hepatocyte growth factor were expressed in the EAE brain and specifically in microglia and astrocytes. Their cognate receptors, CXCR4, CCR2 or c-Met were constitutively expressed on NPCs. Selective blockage of CXCR4, CCR2 or c-Met partially inhibited NPC migration in EAE brains. Blocking all three receptors had an additive effect and resulted in profound inhibition of NPC migration, as compared to extensive migration of control NPCs. The inflammation-triggered NPC migration into white matter tracts was dependent on a motile NPC phenotype. Specifically, depriving NPCs from epidermal growth factor (EGF) prevented the induction of glial commitment and a motile phenotype (as indicated by an in vitro motility assay), hampering their response to neuroinflammation.In conclusion, signaling via three chemokine systems accounts for most of the inflammation-induced, tissue-derived attraction of transplanted NPCs into white matter tracts during EAE.",

As there is mounting evidence that the hematopoietic impairment starts already in utero, a human pluripotent stem cell model would constitute a more appropriate system to investigate the mechanisms underlying BMF in FA and its developmental basis. Using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) technology, we have created a knockout of FANCA in human embryonic stem cells (hESC). We introduced a selection cassette into exon 2 thereby disrupting the FANCA coding sequence and found that whereas mono-allelically targeted cells retain an unaltered proliferation potential, disruption of the second allele causes a severe growth disadvantage. As a result, heterogeneous cultures arise due to the presence of cells still carrying an unaffected FANCA allele, quickly outgrowing the knockout cells. When pure cultures of FANCA knockout hESC are pursued either through selection or single cell cloning, this rapidly results in growth arrest and such cultures cannot be maintained. These data highlight the importance of a functional FA pathway at the pluripotent stem cell stage.",

In this study, we investigated the role of Cdo in midbrain DA neurogenesis. Cdo and Shh signaling components are induced during neurogenesis of embryonic stem (ES) cells. Cdo\u2212/\u2212 ES cells show reduced neuronal differentiation accompanied by increased cell death upon neuronal induction. In addition, Cdo\u2212/\u2212 ES cells form fewer tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and microtubule associated protein 2 (MAP2)-positive DA neurons correlating with the decreased expression of key regulators of DA neurogenesis, such as Shh, Neurogenin2, Mash1, Foxa2, Lmx1a, Nurr1 and Pitx3, relative to the Cdo+/+ ES cells. Consistently, the Cdo\u2212/\u2212 embryonic midbrain displays a reduction in expression of TH and Nurr1. Furthermore, activation of Shh signaling by treatment with Purmorphamine (Pur) restores the DA neurogenesis of Cdo\u2212/\u2212 ES cells, suggesting that Cdo is required for the full Shh signaling activation to induce efficient DA neurogenesis.",

Primary cilia are an extracellular sensory organelle present on most growth arrested cells that transduce information about the cellular environment into cells, triggering signaling cascades that have profound effects on development, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation and migration.Migrating cells likely encounter differing oxygen tensions, therefore we investigated the effect of oxygen tension on cilia. Using bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) we found that oxygen tension significantly affected the length of cilia in primary BMSCs. Chronic exposure to hypoxia specifically down-regulated genes involved in hedgehog signaling and re-localized the Smo and Gli2 proteins to cilia. Investigating the effects of chemotactic migration on cilia, we observed significantly longer cilia in migrating cells which was again, strongly influenced by oxygen tension. Finally, using computational modeling we identified links between migration and ciliation signaling pathways, characterizing the novel role of HSP90 and PI3K signaling in regulating BMSC cilia length.These findings enhance our current understanding of BMSC adaptions to hypoxia and advance our knowledge of BMSC biology and cilia regulation.",

To detect cross-talk mechanisms we then integrated the transcriptome data that displayed differential regulation with protein interaction data. A new class of non-transcriptionally regulated genes was identified, encoding proteins which interact systematically with proteins corresponding to genes regulated during the cell cycle or cell differentiation, and which therefore can be seen as interface proteins coordinating the two programs. Functional analysis gathered insights in fate-specific candidates of interface functionalities.

Still, little is known regarding its effect on DG stem cell properties. Herein, we investigate the impact of METH on mice DG stem/progenitor cell self-renewal functions. METH (10\u00a0nM) decreased DG stem cell self-renewal, while 1\u00a0nM delayed cell cycle in the G0/G1-to-S phase transition and increased the number of quiescent cells (G0 phase), which correlated with a decrease in cyclin E, pEGFR and pERK1/2 protein levels. Importantly, both drug concentrations (1 or 10\u00a0nM) did not induce cell death. In accordance with the impairment of self-renewal capacity, METH (10\u00a0nM) decreased Sox2+/Sox2+ while increased Sox2\u2212/Sox2\u2212 pairs of daughter cells. This effect relied on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) signaling, which was prevented by the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (10\u00a0\u03bcM). Moreover, METH (10\u00a0nM) increased doublecortin (DCX) protein levels consistent with neuronal differentiation.

Allogeneic transplantation of hESC-derived tissues from results in immunological rejection absent adjunctive immunosuppression. The goal of our study was to generate a universal pluripotent stem cell source by nucleofecting a mutated human leukocyte antigen G (mHLA-G) gene into hESCs using the PiggyBac transposon. We successfully generated stable mHLA-G(EF1\u03b1)-hESC lines using chEF1\u03b1 promoter system that stably expressed mHLA-G protein during prolonged undifferentiated proliferation andin differentiated embryoid bodies as well as teratomas. Morphology, karyotype, and telomerase activity of mHLA-G expressing hESC were normal. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry analysis revealed persistent expression of pluripotent markers, OCT-3/4 and SSEA-4, in undifferentiated mHLA-G(EF1\u03b1)-hESC. Nucleofected hESC formed teratomas and when directed to differentiate into epidermal precursors, expressed high levels of mHLA-G and keratinocyte markers K14 and CD29. Natural killer cell cytotoxicity assays demonstrated a significant decrease in lysis of mHLA-G(EF1a)-hESC targets relative to control cells. Similar results were obtained with mHLA-G(EF1\u03b1)-hESC-derived epidermal progenitors (hEEP). One way mixed T lymphocyte reactions unveiled that mHLA-G(EF1a)-hESC and -hEEP restrained the proliferative activity of mixed T lymphocytes. We conclude that heterologous expression of mHLA-G decreases immunogenicity of hESCs and their epidermal differentiated derivatives.",

Conversely, suppression of MEK/ERKs signaling enhances Nanog transactivation to inhibit ES cell differentiation. We observed that phosphorylation of Nanog by ERK1 decreases Nanog stability through ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation.

It is also reported that Na/K-ATPase signaling function effects stem cell differentiation. This study evaluated whether Na/K-ATPase activation through its ligands and associated signaling functions affect bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs, also known as bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells) differentiation capacity. BMSCs were isolated from male Sprague\u2013Dawley rats and cultured in minimal essential medium alpha (MEM-\u03b1) supplemented with 15% Fetal Bovine serum (FBS). The results showed that marinobufagenin (MBG), a specific Na/K-ATPase ligand, potentiated rosiglitazone-induced adipogenesis in these BMSCs. Meanwhile, it attenuated BMSC osteogenesis. Mechanistically, MBG increased CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u03b1) protein expression through activation of an extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway, which leads to enhanced rosiglitazone-induced adipogenesis. Inhibition of ERK activation by U0126 blocks the effect of MBG on C/EBP\u03b1 expression and on rosiglitazone-induced adipogenesis. Reciprocally, MBG reduced runt-related transcription factor 2 (RunX2) expression, which resulted in the inhibition of osteogenesis induced by \u03b2-glycerophosphate/ascorbic acid. MBG also potentiated rosiglitazone-induced adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells and in mouse BMSCs. These results suggest that Na/K-ATPase and its signaling functions are involved in the regulation of BMSCs differentiation.",

Androgen and androgen receptor (androgen/AR) signaling has been reported to participate in cancer stemness in some types of cancer; however, this phenomenon has never been studied in OVTC.Ovarian teratocarcinoma cell line PA1 was manipulated to overexpress or knockdown AR by lentiviral deliver system. After analyzing of AR expression in PA1 cells, cell growth assay was assessed at every given time point. In order to determine ligand effect on AR actions, luciferase assay was performed to evaluate endogenous and exogenous AR function in PA1 cells. CD133 stem cell marker antibody was used to identify CSPCs in PA1 cells, and AR expression level in enriched CSPCs was determined. To assess AR effects on CD133\u00a0+ population progression, stem cell functional assays (side population, sphere formation assay, CD133 expression) were used to analyze role of AR in PA1 CSPCs. In tissue specimen, immunohistochemistry staining was used to carry out AR and CD133 staining in normal and tumor tissue.We examined androgen/AR signaling in OVTC PA1 cells, a CSPCs-rich cell line, and found that AR, but not androgen, promoted cell growth. We also examined the effects of AR on CSPCs characteristics and found that AR expression was more abundant in CD133\u00a0+ cells, a well-defined ovarian cancer stem/progenitor marker, than in CD133\u00a0\u2212 populations. Moreover, results of the sphere formation assay revealed that AR expression was required to maintain CSPCs populations. Interestingly, this AR-governed self-renewal capacity of CSPCs was only observed in CD133\u00a0+ cells. In addition, we found that AR-mediated CSPCs enrichment was accompanied by down-regulation of p53 and p16. Finally, co-expression of AR and CD133 was more abundant in OVTC lesions than in normal ovarian tissue.The results of this study suggest that AR itself might play a ligand-independent role in the development of OVTC.",

The growth of an immortalized hNSC line, ReNcell VM, was evaluated on a miniaturized cell culture chip consisting of 60\u00a0nl spots of cells encapsulated in alginate, and compared to standard 2D well plate culture conditions. Using a live/dead cell viability assay, we demonstrated that the hNSCs are able to expand on-chip, albeit with lower proliferation rates and viabilities than in conventional 2D culture platforms. Using an in-cell, on-chip immunofluorescence assay, which provides quantitative information on cellular levels of proteins involved in neural fate, we demonstrated that ReNcell VM can preserve its multipotent state during on-chip expansion. Moreover, differentiation of the hNSCs into glial progeny was achieved both off- and on-chip six days after growth factor removal, accompanied by a decrease in the neural progenitor markers. The versatility of the platform was further demonstrated by complementing the cell culture chip with a chamber system that allowed us to screen for differential toxicity of small molecules to hNSCs. Using this approach, we showed differential toxicity when evaluating three neurotoxic compounds and one antiproliferative compound, and the null effect of a non-toxic compound at relevant concentrations. Thus, our 3D high-throughput microarray platform may help predict, in vitro, which compounds pose an increased threat to neural development and should therefore be prioritized for further screening and evaluation.",

However, the cellular underpinnings of these changes are not well understood. Our analyses have revealed that there are two distinct transit-amplifying cell populations that respond in opposite ways to injury. Mash1\u00a0+ transit-amplifying cells are the primary SVZ cell type that is stimulated to divide following TBI. In contrast, the EGFR\u00a0+ population, which has been considered to be a functionally equivalent progenitor population to Mash1\u00a0+ cells in the uninjured brain, becomes significantly less proliferative after injury. Although normally quiescent GFAP\u00a0+ stem cells are stimulated to divide in SVZ ablation models, we found that the GFAP\u00a0+ stem cells do not divide more after TBI. We found, instead, that TBI results in increased numbers of GFAP\u00a0+/EGFR\u00a0+ stem cells via non-proliferative means\u2014potentially through the dedifferentiation of progenitor cells. EGFR\u00a0+ progenitors from injured brains only were competent to revert to a stem cell state following brief exposure to growth factors. Thus, our results demonstrate previously unknown changes in lineage relationships that differ from conventional models and likely reflect an adaptive response of the SVZ to maintain endogenous brain repair after TBI.",

     "abstract": "Pelota (Pelo) is ubiquitously expressed, and its genetic deletion in mice leads to embryonic lethality at an early post-implantation stage. In the present study, we conditionally deleted Pelo and showed that PELO deficiency did not markedly affect the self-renewal of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or their capacity to differentiate in teratoma assays. However, their differentiation into extraembryonic endoderm (ExEn) in embryoid bodies (EBs) was severely compromised. Conversely, forced expression of Pelo in ESCs resulted in spontaneous differentiation toward the ExEn lineage. Failure of Pelo-deficient ESCs to differentiate into ExEn was accompanied by the retained expression of pluripotency-related genes and alterations in expression of components of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathway. Further experiments have also revealed that attenuated activity of BMP signaling is responsible for the impaired development of ExEn. The recovery of ExEn and down-regulation of pluripotent genes in BMP4-treated Pelo-null EBs indicate that the failure of mutant cells to down-regulate pluripotency-related genes in EBs is not a result of autonomous defect, but rather to failed signals from surrounding ExEn lineage that induce the differentiation program. In vivo studies showed the presence of ExEn in Pelo-null embryos at E6.5, yet embryonic lethality at E7.5, suggesting that PELO is not required for the induction of ExEn development, but rather for ExEn maintenance or for terminal differentiation toward functional visceral endoderm which provides the embryos with growth factors required for further development. Moreover, Pelo-null fibroblasts failed to reprogram toward induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) due to inactivation of BMP signaling and impaired mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition. Thus, our results indicate that PELO plays an important role in the establishment of pluripotency and differentiation of ESCs into ExEn lineage through activation of BMP signaling.",

This cell line is competent to contribute to chimeric animals, including germ cells, at high efficiency. The ERK1/2, SMAD2/3, and JAK/STAT3 pathways are essential to maintain self-renewal. Inhibition of ERK1/2 or SMAD2/3 initiates transition to a naive state ESC-like state, whereas inhibition of JAK/STAT3 promotes a primed EpiSC-like character.

To elucidate the osteoinductive potential of porous substrates with different pore diameters (30\u00a0nm, 100\u00a0nm), human neural crest-derived stem cells isolated from the inferior nasal turbinate were cultivated on the surface of nanoporous titanium covered membranes without additional chemical or biological osteoinductive cues. As controls, flat titanium without any topological features and osteogenic medium was used. Cultivation of human neural crest-derived stem cells on 30\u00a0nm pores resulted in osteogenic differentiation as demonstrated by alkaline phosphatase activity after seven days as well as by calcium deposition after 3\u00a0weeks of cultivation. In contrast, cultivation on flat titanium and on membranes equipped with 100\u00a0nm pores was not sufficient to induce osteogenic differentiation. Moreover, we demonstrate an increase of osteogenic transcripts including Osterix, Osteocalcin and up-regulation of Integrin \u03b21 and \u03b12 in the 30\u00a0nm pore approach only.

The purpose of this study was to examine the response of slow-cycling progenitor cells in the adult mouse prostate to castration. Proliferating cells in the E16 urogenital sinus were pulse labeled by BrdU administration or by doxycycline-controlled labeling of the histone-H2B GFP mouse. A small population of labeled epithelial cells in the adult prostate localized at the junction of the prostatic ducts and urethra. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) showed that GFP label-retaining cells were enriched for cells co-expressing stem cell markers Sca-1, CD133, CD44 and CD117 (4- marker cells; 60-fold enrichment). FACS showed, additionally, that 4-marker cells were androgen receptor positive. Castration induced proliferation and dispersal of E16 labeled cells into more distal ductal segments. When na\u00efve adult mice were administered BrdU daily for 2\u00a0weeks after castration, 16% of 4-marker cells exhibited BrdU label in contrast to only 6% of all epithelial cells (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01). In sham-castrated controls less than 4% of 4-marker cells were BrdU labeled (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01).

We found that glioma stem cells appear to be highly prone to undergo aberrant cell division and polyploidization. Moreover, we discovered a pronounced change in the dynamic of mitotic centrosome maturation in these cells. Accordingly, glioma stem cell survival appeared to be strongly dependent on Aurora A activity. Unlike differentiated cells, glioma stem cells responded to moderate Aurora A inhibition with spindle defects, polyploidization and a dramatic increase in cellular senescence, and were selectively sensitive to Aurora A and Plk1 inhibitor treatment. Our study proposes inhibition of centrosomal kinases as a novel strategy to selectively target glioma stem cells.",

Genetic disruption of the mouse Ptp4a3 gene reduces the frequency of colon tumor formation in mice treated in a colitis-associated cancer model. In the current study, we have examined the role of Ptp4a3 in the tumor-initiating cell population of mouse colon tumors using an in vitro culture system. Tumors generated in vivo following AOM/DSS treatment were isolated, dissociated, and expanded on a feeder layer resulting in a CD133+ cell population, which expressed high levels of Ptp4a3. Tumor cells deficient for Ptp4a3 exhibited reduced clonogenicity and growth potential relative to WT cells as determined by limiting dilution analysis. Importantly, expanded tumor cells from WT mice readily formed secondary tumors when transplanted into nude mice, while tumor cells without Ptp4a3 expression failed to form secondary tumors and thus were not tumorigenic. These results demonstrate that Ptp4a3 contributes to the malignant phenotype of tumor-initiating cells and supports its role as a potential therapeutic target to inhibit tumor self-renewal and metastasis.",

Here we sought to define cell lineage relationships based on the expression of NKX2-5 and the cell surface markers VCAM1, SIRPA and CD34 during human cardiovascular development. Expression of NKX2-5GFP was used to identify cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes generated during the differentiation of NKX2-5GFP/w human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Cardiovascular cell lineages sub-fractionated on the basis of SIRPA, VCAM1 and CD34 expression were assayed for differentiation potential and gene expression. The NKX2-5posCD34pos population gave rise to endothelial cells that rapidly lost NKX2-5 expression in culture. Conversely, NKX2-5 expression was maintained in myocardial committed cells, which progressed from being NKX2-5posSIRPApos to NKX2-5posSIRPAposVCAM1pos. Up-regulation of VCAM1 was accompanied by the expression of myofilament markers and reduced clonal capacity, implying a restriction of cell fate potential. Combinatorial expression of NKX2-5, SIRPA, VCAM1 and CD34 can be used to define discrete stages of cardiovascular cell lineage differentiation. These markers identify specific stages of cardiomyocyte and endothelial lineage commitment and, thus provide a scaffold for establishing a fate map of early human cardiogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) contain a subset of multipotent stem cells. Here, we demonstrate that serotonin, a biogenic amine released by platelets and mast cells, can induce the smooth muscle differentiation of BMSCs. Brown Norway rat BMSCs stimulated with serotonin had increased expression of the smooth muscle markers smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (MHC) and \u03b1 actin (\u03b1-SMA) by qPCR and Western blot, indicating smooth muscle differentiation. This was accompanied by a concomitant down-regulation of the microRNA miR-25-5p, which was found to negatively regulate smooth muscle differentiation. Serotonin upregulated serum response factor (SRF) and myocardin, transcription factors known to induce contractile protein expression in smooth muscle cells, while it down-regulated Elk1 and Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), known to induce proliferation. Serotonin increased SRF binding to promoter regions of the MHC and \u03b1-SMA genes, assessed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Induction of smooth muscle differentiation by serotonin was blocked by the knock-down of SRF and myocardin. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21 was constitutively expressed by BMSCs and serotonin triggered its release. Inhibition of miR-25-5p augmented TGF-\u03b21 expression, however the differentiation of BMSCs was not mediated by TGF-\u03b21. These findings demonstrate that serotonin promotes a smooth muscle-like phenotype in BMSCs by altering the balance of SRF, myocardin, Elk1 and KLF4 and miR-25-5p is involved in modulating this balance. Therefore, serotonin potentially contributes to the pathogenesis of diseases characterized by tissue remodeling with increased smooth muscle mass.",

Although the current concepts of their clinical use include the expansion of hBMSC in standard cell culture conditions, the effect of the mitogen-driven ex vivo expansion on the adaptation to the hypoxic environment is unknown. Here, we provide data that the basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) enhances the induction of a wide range of hypoxia-related adaptive genes in hypoxic hBMSCs. We identified that the FGF2 signal is transmitted by the ERK pathway similar to that of hypoxia that also utilises the distal elements of the same signalling machinery including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MEK1/2) in hBMSCs. We found that the simultaneous activation of ERK1/2 by FGF2 and hypoxia transforms the activation dynamics from oscillatory into sustained one. Activated ERKs co-localise with stabilised hypoxia inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) followed by the reduction of its nuclear mobility as well as increased DNA binding capacity leading to the up-regulation of hypoxia-adaptive genes.

Here we show that non-mineralized cartilage pellets formed by hBMSCs ex vivo generate complete ossicles upon heterotopic transplantation in the absence of exogenous scaffolds. These ossicles display a remarkable degree of architectural fidelity, showing that an exogenous conductive scaffold is not an absolute requirement for bone formation by transplanted BMSCs. Marrow cavities within the ossicles include erythroid, myeloid and granulopoietic lineages, clonogenic hematopoietic progenitors and phenotypic HSCs, indicating that complete stem cell niches and hematopoiesis are established. hBMSCs (CD146+ adventitial reticular cells) are established in the heterotopic chimeric bone marrow through a unique process of endochondral bone marrow formation, distinct from physiological endochondral bone formation. In this process, chondrocytes remain viable and proliferate within the pellet, are released from cartilage, and convert into bone marrow stromal cells. Once explanted in secondary culture, these cells retain phenotype and properties of skeletal stem cells (\u201cMSCs\u201d), including the ability to form secondary cartilage pellets and secondary ossicles upon serial transplantation. Ex vivo, hBMSCs initially induced to form cartilage pellets can be reestablished in adherent culture and can modulate gene expression between cartilage and stromal cell phenotypes.

Located in the back of the nose, this multipotent stem cell type is readily accessible in humans, a feature that makes these cells highly suitable for the development of autologous cell-based therapies. However, preclinical studies based on autologous transplantation of rodent olfactory stem cells are impeded because of the narrow opening of the nasal cavity. In this study, we report the development of a unique method permitting to quickly and safely biopsy olfactory mucosa in rats. Using this newly developed technique, rat stem cells expressing the stem cell marker Nestin were successfully isolated without requiring the sacrifice of the donor animal. As an evidence of the self-renewal capacity of the isolated cells, several millions of rat cells were amplified from a single biopsy within four weeks. Using an olfactory discrimination test, we additionally showed that this novel biopsy method does not affect the sense of smell and the learning and memory abilities of the operated animals. This study describes for the first time a methodology allowing the derivation of rat nasal cells in a way that is suitable for studying the effects of autologous transplantation of any cell type present in the olfactory mucosa in a wide variety of rat models.",

Nanog plays an important role in early development and is essential to induce natural pluripotency in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Inducible gain-of-function systems allowing a precise control over time and dosage of Nanog activity would be highly desirable to study its vital role in the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency at molecular level. Here we engineered a recombinant cell permeable version of Nanog by fusing it with the cell penetrating peptide TAT. Nanog-TAT can be readily expressed in and purified from E. coli and binds to a consensus Nanog DNA sequence. At cellular level it enhances proliferation and self-renewal of ESCs in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Nanog-TAT together with LIF acts synergistically as judged by enhanced clonogenicity and activation of an Oct4-promoter-driven GFP reporter gene. Furthermore Nanog-TAT, in the absence of LIF, promotes pluripotency by inhibiting endodermal specification in a Stat3-independent manner. Our results demonstrate that Nanog protein transduction is an attractive tool allowing control over dose and time of addition to the cells for studying the molecular control of pluripotency without genetic manipulation.",

The results of a study that aimed to understand the mechanisms of this effect are presented here. Because taurine was not found in NPC nuclei, direct interactions with nuclear elements seem unlikely. A gene expression profile analysis indicated that genes that are regulated by taurine have roles in i) proliferation, including the Shh and Wnt pathways; ii) cellular adhesion; iii) cell survival; and iv) mitochondrial functioning. Cell cycle analysis of propidium iodide and CFSE-labeled cells using flow cytometry revealed an increase in the number of cells in the S-phase and a decrease in those in the G0/G1 phase in taurine-treated cultures. No changes in the length of the cell cycle were observed. Quantification of the viable, apoptotic, and necrotic cells in cultures using flow cytometry and calcein-AM, annexin-V, and propidium iodide staining showed reductions in the number of apoptotic and necrotic cells (18% to 11% and 13% to 10%, respectively) and increases in the number of viable cells (61% to 69%) in the taurine-treated cultures. Examination of the relative mitochondrial potential values by flow cytometry and rhodamine123 or JC-1 staining showed a 44% increase in the number of cells with higher mitochondrial potential and a 38% increase in the mitochondrial membrane potential in taurine cultures compared with those of controls. Taken together, the results suggest that taurine provides more favorable conditions for cell proliferation by improving mitochondrial functioning.",

According to these relevant biological properties of GAG, we designed a GAG mimetic having the capacity to increase the yield of ECFC production from blood and to improve functionality of their endothelial outgrowth.

The increase in the expression of p-JNK with pUC treatment was mostly localized to nucleus whereas increase in the expression of p-JNK with radiation and overexpression of uPAR and cathepsin B was confined to cytoplasm of the cells. Depletion of cytosolic p-JNK with pUC treatment inhibited migration by downregulating the expression of the adapter proteins of the focal adhesion complex. We also observed that knockdown of uPAR and cathepsin B regulated the Ras\u2013Pak-1 pathway to induce the translocation of p-JNK from cytosol to nucleus. In control cells, Pak-1 served as a functional inhibitor for MEKK-1, which inhibits the complex formation of MEKK-1 and p-JNK and thus inhibits the translocation of this complex into nucleus. Hence, we conclude that glioma cells utilize the availability of cytosolic p-JNK in driving the cells towards migration. Finally, treating the cells with pUC alone or in combination with radiation induced the translocation of the MEKK-1-p-JNK complex from cytosol to nucleus, thereby inhibiting the migration of glioma cells.",

An unbiased analysis of functional regulation indicated robust modulation of concurrent programs at critical junctures.

Furthermore, the involvement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in this context was examined. C2C12 myoblasts were therefore repeatedly incubated for 2\u00a0h each day with 10\u00a0mM or 20\u00a0mM La differentiation medium (DM) and in some cases 20\u00a0mM La DM plus different antioxidative substances for up to 5\u00a0days. La free (0\u00a0mM) DM served as a control. Immunocytochemical staining, Western blot analysis and colorimetric assays were used to assess oxidative stress, proliferation, and differentiation. Results show that La induces oxidative stress, enhances cell-cycle withdrawal, and initiates early differentiation but delays late differentiation in a timely and dose-dependent manner. These effects can be reversed by the addition of antioxidants to the La DM.

In this study, we demonstrate that VGF-derived peptide TLQP-62 specifically enhances the generation of early progenitor cells in nestin-GFP mice. Specifically, TLQP-62 significantly increases the number of Type 2a neural progenitor cells (NPCs) while reducing the number of more differentiated Type 3 cells. The effect of TLQP-62 on proliferation rather than differentiation was confirmed using NPCs in vitro; TLQP-62 but not scrambled peptide PEHN-62 increases proliferation in a cell line as well as in primary progenitors from adult hippocampus. Moreover, TLQP-62 but not scrambled peptide increases Cyclin D mRNA expression. The proliferation of NPCs induced by TLQP-62 requires synaptic activity, in particular through NMDA and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The activation of glutamate receptors by TLQP-62 activation induces phosphorylation of CaMKII through NMDA receptors and protein kinase D through metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5). Furthermore, pharmacological antagonists to CaMKII and PKD inhibit TLQP-62-induced proliferation of NPCs indicating that these signaling molecules downstream of glutamate receptors are essential for the actions of TLQP-62 on neurogenesis. We also show that TLQP-62 gradually activates Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)-receptor TrkB in vitro and that Trk signaling is required for TLQP-62-induced proliferation of NPCs.

As vascular access within the tooth is restricted by the apical foramen, it is of major importance to implement effective vascularization strategies in order to recreate viable components of teeth and periodontal tissues. However, while the current regenerative approaches focus on the use of dental stem cells (DSCs), little is known about these cells and their ability to promote angiogenesis. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the paracrine angiogenic properties of postnatal DSCs, in particular dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), stem cells from the apical papilla (SCAPs) and dental follicle precursor cells (FSCs). An antibody array, together with RT-PCR and ELISA, pointed out the differential expression of pro-angiogenic as well as anti-angiogenic factors by cultured DSCs and human gingival fibroblasts (HGF-1). Despite the secretion of proliferation-promoting factors, DSCs caused no notable increase in the proliferation of human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). With regard to other aspects of the angiogenic cascade, DPSCs, SCAPs and HGF-1 significantly promoted endothelial migration in a transwell migration assay. DPSCs also had a pronounced effect on endothelial tubulogenesis, as was shown by an in vitro Matrigel\u2122 assay. In the last part of this study, a chorioallantoic membrane assay demonstrated a sustained pro-angiogenic impact of DPSCs and SCAPs in an in vivo setting. Collectively, these data indicate a predominant pro-angiogenic influence of DPSCs and SCAPS in vitro and in vivo in comparison to FSCs, suggesting that both stem cell populations could potentially promote the vascularization of regenerated dental tissues.",

     "abstract": "Stem cells, especially human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), are useful models to study molecular mechanisms of human disorders that originate during gestation. Alcohol (ethanol, EtOH) consumption during pregnancy causes a variety of prenatal and postnatal disorders collectively referred to as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). To better understand the molecular events leading to FASDs, we performed a genome-wide analysis of EtOH's effects on the maintenance and differentiation of hESCs in culture. Gene Co-expression Network Analysis showed significant alterations in gene profiles of EtOH-treated differentiated or undifferentiated hESCs, particularly those associated with molecular pathways for metabolic processes, oxidative stress, and neuronal properties of stem cells. A genome-wide DNA methylome analysis revealed widespread EtOH-induced alterations with significant hypermethylation of many regions of chromosomes. Undifferentiated hESCs were more vulnerable to EtOH's effect than their differentiated counterparts, with methylation on the promoter regions of chromosomes 2, 16 and 18 in undifferentiated hESCs most affected by EtOH exposure. Combined transcriptomic and DNA methylomic analysis produced a list of differentiation-related genes dysregulated by EtOH-induced DNA methylation changes, which likely play a role in EtOH-induced decreases in hESC pluripotency. DNA sequence motif analysis of genes epigenetically altered by EtOH identified major motifs representing potential binding sites for transcription factors. These findings should help in deciphering the precise mechanisms of alcohol-induced teratogenesis.",

While quiescent ependymal cells showed cytoplasmic ATF3 expression, during 6\u201324\u00a0h in vitro these cells mobilized and acquired intense nuclear ATF3 staining. Their migratory pattern followed a centrifugal pathway toward the dorsal and ventral funiculi, reminiscent of the rostral migratory stream of the brain subventricular stem cells. Thus, the chain cell formation was, by analogy, termed funicular migratory stream (FMS). The FMS process preceded the strong proliferation of ependymal cells occurring only after 24\u00a0h in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition of MAPK-p38 and JNK/c-Jun (upstream effectors of ATF3 activation) prevented the FMS mobilization of ATF3 nuclear-positive cells. Excitotoxicity or ischemia-like conditions, reported to evoke neuronal and glial injury, did not further enhance migration of ependymal cells at 24\u00a0h, suggesting that, at this early stage of damage, the FMS phenomenon had peaked and that more extensive repair processes are delayed beyond this time point. ATF3 is, therefore, useful to identify activation and migration of endogenous stem cells of the rat spinal cord in vitro.",

We show that these cells are well comparable in their differentiation potential and are generally similar to human, cynomolgus and rhesus monkey embryonic stem cells (ESCs). RNA sequencing reveals that expression differences among clones, individuals and stem cell type are all of very similar magnitude within a species. In contrast, expression differences between closely related primate species are three times larger and most genes show significant expression differences among the analyzed species. However, pseudogenes differ more than twice as much, suggesting that evolution of expression levels in primate stem cells is rapid, but constrained. These patterns in pluripotent stem cells are comparable to those found in other tissues except testis. Hence, primate iPSCs reveal insights into general primate gene expression evolution and should provide a rich source to identify conserved and species-specific gene expression patterns for cellular phenotypes.",

We and others have shown that encapsulation of cells in a bilaminar device (TheraCyte) provides immunoprotection in rodents and primates. Here we monitored human insulin secretion and employed bioluminescent imaging (BLI) to evaluate the maturation, growth, and containment of encapsulated islet progenitors derived from CyT49 hESC, transplanted into mice. Human insulin was detectable by 7\u00a0weeks post-transplant and increased 17-fold over the course of 8\u00a0weeks, yet during this period the biomass of encapsulated cells remained constant. Remarkably, by 20\u00a0weeks post-transplant encapsulated cells secreted sufficient levels of human insulin to ameliorate alloxan induced diabetes. Further, bioluminescent imaging revealed for the first time that hESCs remained fully contained in encapsulation devices for up to 150\u00a0days, the longest period tested. Collectively, the data suggest that encapsulated hESC derived islet progenitors hold great promise as an effective and safe cell replacement therapy for insulin dependent diabetes.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional modulators of gene expression that play an important role in many developmental processes. Here, we show that the miR-99a/let-7c cluster, mapping on human chromosome 21, is involved in the control of cardiomyogenesis by altering epigenetic factors. By perturbing miRNA expression in mouse embryonic stem cells, we find that let-7c promotes cardiomyogenesis by upregulating genes involved in mesoderm specification (T/Bra and Nodal) and cardiac differentiation (Mesp1, Nkx2.5 and Tbx5). The action of let-7c is restricted to the early phase of mesoderm formation at the expense of endoderm and its late activation redirects cells toward other mesodermal derivatives. The Polycomb complex group protein Ezh2 is a direct target of let-7c, which promotes cardiac differentiation by modifying the H3K27me3 marks from the promoters of crucial cardiac transcription factors (Nkx2.5, Mef2c, Tbx5). In contrast, miR-99a represses cardiac differentiation via the nucleosome-remodeling factor Smarca5, attenuating the Nodal/Smad2 signaling. We demonstrated that the identified targets are underexpressed in human Down syndrome fetal heart specimens. By perturbing the expression levels of these miRNAs in embryonic stem cells, we were able to demonstrate that these miRNAs control lineage- and stage-specific transcription factors, working in concert with chromatin modifiers to direct cardiomyogenesis.",

In the miR-200 family, miR-200c was especially enriched in undifferentiated hESCs and significantly downregulated in EBs. The knockdown of the miR-200c in hESCs downregulated Nanog expression, upregulated GATA binding protein 4 (GATA4) expression, and induced hESC apoptosis. The knockdown of GATA4 rescued hESC apoptosis induced by downregulation of miR-200c. miR-200c directly targeted the 3\u2032-untranslated region of GATA4. Interestingly, the downregulation of GATA4 significantly inhibited EB formation in hESCs. Overexpression of miR-200c inhibited EB formation and repressed the expression of ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm markers, which could partially be rescued by ectopic expression of GATA4. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and activin A/nodal can sustain hESC renewal in the absence of feeder layer. Inhibition of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/activin A/nodal signaling by SB431542 treatment downregulated the expression of miR-200c.

Vitamin C is beneficial for bone formation, fracture repair and wound healing. However, the role of the vitamin C transporter in BMSC adhesion, migration and wound healing is not known. In this study, we knocked-down the sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter, SVCT2, the only known transporter of vitamin C in BMSCs, and performed cell adhesion, migration, in-vitro scratch wound healing and F-actin re-arrangement studies. We also investigated the role of oxidative stress on the above processes. Our results demonstrate that both oxidative stress and down-regulation of SVCT2 decreased cell attachment and spreading. A trans-well cell migration assay showed that vitamin C helped in BMSC migration and that knockdown of SVCT2 decreased cell migration. In the in-vitro scratch wound healing studies, we established that oxidative stress dose-dependently impairs wound healing. Furthermore, the supplementation of vitamin C significantly rescued the BMSCs from oxidative stress and increased wound closing. The knockdown of SVCT2 in BMSCs strikingly decreased wound healing, and supplementing with vitamin C failed to rescue cells efficiently. The knockdown of SVCT2 and induction of oxidative stress in cells produced an alteration in cytoskeletal dynamics. Signaling studies showed that oxidative stress phosphorylated members of the MAP kinase family (p38) and that vitamin C inhibited their phosphorylation. Taken together, these results indicate that both the SVCT2 transporter and oxidative stress play a vital role in BMSC attachment, migration and cytoskeletal re-arrangement. BMSC-based cell therapy and modulation of SVCT2 could lead to a novel therapeutic approach that enhances bone remodeling, fracture repair and wound healing in chronic disease conditions.",

Following 5-ethynyl-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (EdU) injection, in the upper side population (USP) the percentage of EdU\u00a0+ was 36% showing this fraction to be highly proliferative. In the lower side population (LSP), only 0.4% of cells were EdU\u00a0+, indicating this fraction to be predominantly non-cycling. Using Lgr5-EGFP mice, we show that Lgr5-EGFPhi cells, representing actively cycling ISCs, are essentially exclusive to the USP. In contrast, using histone 2B-YFP mice, SP analysis revealed YFP label retaining cells (LRCs) in both the USP and the LSP. Correspondingly, evaluation of the SP fractions for mRNA markers by qRT-PCR showed that the USP was enriched in transcripts associated with both quiescent and active ISCs. In contrast, the LSP expressed mRNA markers of quiescent ISCs while being de-enriched for those of the active ISC. Both the USP and LSP are capable of generating enteroids in culture which include the four intestinal lineages. We conclude that sorting of USP and LSP fractions represents a novel isolation of cycling and non-cycling ISCs from WT mice.",

Neuronal cells are of great interest for medical treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and traumatic injuries of central nervous system (CNS), but efforts to produce these cells have been met with only modest success. In an attempt of finding new approaches, atmospheric-pressure room-temperature microplasma jets (MPJs) are shown to effectively direct in vitro differentiation of neural stem cells (NSCs) predominantly into neuronal lineage. Murine neural stem cells (C17.2-NSCs) treated with MPJs exhibit rapid proliferation and differentiation with longer neurites and cell bodies eventually forming neuronal networks. MPJs regulate ~\u00a075% of NSCs to differentiate into neurons, which is a higher efficiency compared to common protein- and growth factors-based differentiation. NSCs exposure to quantized and transient (~\u00a0150\u00a0ns) micro-plasma bullets up-regulates expression of different cell lineage markers as \u03b2-Tubulin III (for neurons) and O4 (for oligodendrocytes), while the expression of GFAP (for astrocytes) remains unchanged, as evidenced by quantitative PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy and Western Blot assay. It is shown that the plasma-increased nitric oxide (NO) production is a factor in the fate choice and differentiation of NSCs followed by axonal growth. The differentiated NSC cells matured and produced mostly cholinergic and motor neuronal progeny. It is also demonstrated that exposure of primary rat NSCs to the microplasma leads to quite similar differentiation effects. This suggests that the observed effect may potentially be generic and applicable to other types of neural progenitor cells. The application of this new in vitro strategy to selectively differentiate NSCs into neurons represents a step towards reproducible and efficient production of the desired NSC derivatives.",

DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most lethal forms of DNA damage and, if not repaired correctly, they can lead to cell death, genomic instability and cancer. How human ESCs (hESCs) maintain genomic integrity in response to agents that cause DSBs is relatively unclear. In the present study we aim to determine the hESC response to the DSB inducing agent camptothecin (CPT). We find that hESCs are hypersensitive to CPT, as evidenced by high levels of apoptosis. CPT treatment leads to DNA-damage sensor kinase (ATM and DNA-PKcs) phosphorylation on serine 1981 and serine 2056, respectively. Activation of ATM and DNA-PKcs was followed by histone H2AX phosphorylation on Ser 139, a sensitive reporter of DNA damage. Nuclear accumulation and ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15 were also observed. Remarkably, hESC viability was further decreased when ATM or DNA-PKcs kinase activity was impaired by the use of specific inhibitors. The hypersensitivity to CPT treatment was markedly reduced by blocking p53 translocation to mitochondria with pifithrin-\u03bc. Importantly, programmed cell death was achieved in the absence of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor, p21Waf1, a bona fide p53 target gene. Conversely, differentiated hESCs were no longer highly sensitive to CPT. This attenuated apoptotic response was accompanied by changes in cell cycle profile and by the presence of p21Waf1. The results presented here suggest that p53 has a key involvement in preventing the propagation of damaged hESCs when genome is threatened. As a whole, our findings support the concept that the phenomenon of apoptosis is a prominent player in normal embryonic development.",

In vivo, AR28 induced characteristic axis duplication and secondary regions of chordin expression in Xenopus laevis embryos.Using human BMSCs grown in adipogenic medium, we confirmed that AR28-mediated Wnt signalling caused a significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) dose-dependent reduction of adipogenic markers. In osteogenic media, including dexamethasone, AR28 caused significant (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) decreases in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity compared to vehicle controls, indicative of a reduced osteogenic response. However, when excluding dexamethasone from the osteogenic media, increases in both ALP and mineralisation were identified following AR28 treatment, which was blocked by mitomycin C. Pre-treatment of BMSCs with AR28 for 7\u00a0days before osteogenic induction also increased ALP activity and mineralisation. Furthermore, BMP2-induced osteogenic differentiation was strongly enhanced by AR28 addition within 3\u00a0days, but without concomitant changes in cell number, therefore revealing BMP-dependent and independent mechanisms for Wnt-induced osteogenesis.",

A parameter that predicts for in vivo bone forming capacity is thus far lacking. We employed single colony-derived BMSC cultures to identify such predictive parameters. Using limiting dilution, we have produced sixteen single CFU-F derived BMSC cultures from human bone marrow and found that only five of these formed bone in vivo. The single colony-derived BMSC strains were tested for proliferation, osteogenic-, adipogenic- and chondrogenic differentiation capacity and the expression of a variety of associated markers. The only robust predictors of in vivo bone forming capacity were the induction of alkaline phosphatase, (ALP) mRNA levels and ALP activity during in vitro osteogenic differentiation. The predictive value of in vitro ALP induction was confirmed by analyzing \u201cbulk-cultured\u201d BMSCs from various bone marrow biopsies.

Here, we examine the effect of Wnt signaling on the formation of early hematopoietic progenitors derived from human ESCs. The first hematopoietic progenitor cells in the human ESC system express the pan-hematopoietic marker CD41 and the erythrocyte marker, glycophorin A or CD235. We have developed a novel serum-free, feeder-free, adherent differentiation system that can efficiently generate large numbers of CD41\u00a0+\u00a0CD235\u00a0+ cells. We demonstrate that this cell population contains progenitors not just for primitive erythroid and megakaryocyte cells but for the myeloid lineage as well and term this population the primitive common myeloid progenitor (CMP). Treatment of mesoderm-specified cells with Wnt3a led to a loss of hematopoietic colony-forming ability while the inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling with DKK1 led to an increase in the number of primitive CMPs. Canonical Wnt signaling also inhibits the expansion and/or survival of primitive erythrocytes and megakaryocytes, but not myeloid cells, derived from this progenitor population.

Here we explored the role of STIM1 and Orai1 in neural differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that STIM1 and Orai1 were expressed and functionally active in ES cells, and expressions of STIM1 and Orai1 were dynamically regulated during neural differentiation of mouse ES cells. STIM1 knockdown inhibited the differentiation of mouse ES cells into neural progenitors, neurons, and astrocytes. In addition, STIM1 knockdown caused severe cell death and markedly suppressed the proliferation of neural progenitors. Surprisingly, Orai1 knockdown had little effect on neural differentiation of mouse ES cells, but the neurons derived from Orai1 knockdown ES cells, like those from STIM1 knockdown cells, had defective SOCE. Taken together, our data indicate that STIM1 is involved in both early neural differentiation of ES cells and survival of early differentiated ES cells independent of Orai1-mediated SOCE.",

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been employed to generate beating cardiomyocytes from a patient's skin or blood cells. Here, iPSC methods were used to generate cardiomyocytes starting from the urine of a patient with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Urine was chosen as a starting material because it contains adult stem cells called urine-derived stem cells (USCs). USCs express the canonical reprogramming factors c-myc and klf4, and possess high telomerase activity. Pluripotency of urine-derived iPSC clones was confirmed by immunocytochemistry, RT-PCR and teratoma formation. Urine-derived iPSC clones generated from healthy volunteers and a DMD patient were differentiated into beating cardiomyocytes using a series of small molecules in monolayer culture. Results indicate that cardiomyocytes retain the DMD patient's dystrophin mutation. Physiological assays suggest that dystrophin-deficient cardiomyocytes possess phenotypic differences from normal cardiomyocytes. These results demonstrate the feasibility of generating cardiomyocytes from a urine sample and that urine-derived cardiomyocytes retain characteristic features that might be further exploited for mechanistic studies and drug discovery.",

Here, we demonstrate that perlecan deficiency reduces the number of both GFAP/CD133-positive neural stem cells in the subventricular zone and new neurons integrating into the olfactory bulb. We also show that FGF-2 treatment induces the expression of cyclin D2 through the activation of the Akt and Erk1/2 pathways and promotes neurosphere formation in vitro. However, in the absence of perlecan, FGF-2 fails to promote neurosphere formation. These results suggest that perlecan is a component of the neurogenic niche that regulates FGF-2 signaling and acts by promoting neural stem cell self-renewal and neurogenesis.",

Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from blastocysts are in a \u201cnaive\u201d pluripotent state and meet all of the criteria for pluripotency, including the ability to generate live pups through tetraploid complementation. Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) derived from postimplantation epiblasts are in a \u201cprimed\u201d pluripotent state. ESCs and EpiSCs show different phenotypes and gene expression patterns, and EpiSCs are thought to be less pluripotent than ESCs. In this study, we addressed whether EpiSCs can be differentiated into specialized cell types in vitro. To do this, we first derived EpiSCs from E5.5\u20136.5 mouse embryos containing the Oct4-GFP transgene. We found that EpiSCs expressed pluripotency markers and differentiated into all three germ layers in intro and in vivo. Interestingly, EpiSCs also efficiently differentiated into a homogenous population of neural stem cells (NSCs) in vitro. The EpiSC-derived NSCs (EpiSC-NSCs) expressed NSC markers (Nestin, Sox2, and Musashi), self-renewed for more than 20 passages, and differentiated into neuronal and glial neural cell subtypes in vitro. We then transplanted the EpiSC-NSCs into the neonatal mouse brains, and found that they were able to survive and differentiate into robust neurons and glial cells in the mouse brains, demonstrating that primed pluripotent EpiSCs efficiently form functional NSCs. We compared the global gene expression patterns of NSCs differentiated from EpiSC-NSCs, ESCs, and brain tissue and found that the expression patterns of most genes, including pluripotency and NSC specificity, were similarly clustered, but that the developmental process-related genes were distantly clustered. Moreover, the global gene expression pattern of brain-derived NSCs was more similar to that of ESC-derived NSCs than that of EpiSC-derived NSCs. Taken together, these results indicate that although NSCs, regardless of their origins, display very similar in vitro and in vivo differentiation properties, their global gene expression profiles may differ, depending on the pluripotency state, i.e., naive or primed.",

In vitro derivation of germ cells from the pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced PSCs (iPSCs) are of great values for the treatment of infertility, for animal breeding, and for studying the mechanism of germ cell development. Although the derivations of male germ cells from PSCs have been previously reported, most of the studies failed to conduct the induction in a well-controlled and highly efficient manner. Here, we report the derivation of induced PGC-like cells (iPGCLCs) from mouse iPSCs via induced epiblast-like cells (iEpiLCs) as being monitored by the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein gene under the control of the promoter of stimulated by retinoic acid 8 (Stra8-EGFP). The identity of iPGCLCs was characterized by examining the expression of multiple marker genes as well as by the recovery of spermatogenesis after they were transplanted to the testis of infertile W/Wv mice. Furthermore, iPGCLCs were either induced to germline stem cell-like cells (iGSCLCs) or reverted back to embryonic germ cell-like cells (iEGCLCs). In conclusion, we have established an efficient procedure for inducing iPSCs into iPGCLCs that can be further expanded and induced to more developed germ cells.

     "abstract": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may contribute to neurovascular repair after stroke and neurodegeneration. A key step in this process should involve adhesive interactions between EPCs and the targeted cerebral endothelium. Here, we tested the hypothesis that reactive astrocytes may play a critical role in enhancing adhesive interactions and transmigration of EPCs across cerebral endothelial cells. Transiently seeding EPCs onto a monolayer of RBE.4 rat brain endothelial cells resulted in a time-dependent adherence between the two cell types. Blocking \u03b22 integrins on EPCs or blocking the receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE) on endothelial cells significantly decreased EPC-endothelial adherence. Next, we tested whether reactive astrocytes can enhance this process by growing EPCs, brain endothelial cells and astrocytes together in a transwell co-culture system. The presence of reactive astrocytes in the lower chamber significantly promoted adherence between EPCs and endothelial cells in the upper chamber. This process involved the release of soluble HMGB1 from reactive astrocytes that then upregulated endothelial expression of RAGE via Egr1 signaling. Directly adding HMGB1 to the transwell system also promoted EPC-endothelial adhesion and accelerated EPC transmigration into the lower chamber. These initial findings provide proof-of-concept that reactive astrocytes promote crosstalk between cerebral endothelium and EPCs. Further investigation of this phenomenon may lead to a better understanding of cell\u2013cell interactions required for neurovascular recovery after stroke.",

Previous results have demonstrated that SURVIVIN is expressed at high levels in embryonic stem cells and inhibition of SURVIVIN function results in apoptosis, however these studies have not investigated the other four splice variants. In this study, we demonstrate that all variants are expressed at significantly higher levels in human embryonic stem (hES) cells than in differentiated cells. We examined the subcellular localization of the three most highly expressed variants. SURVIVIN displayed canonical CPP localization in mitotic cells and cytoplasmic localization in interphase cells. In contrast, SURVIVIN\u2013\u0394Ex3 and SURVIVIN\u20132B did not localize as a CPP; SURVIVIN\u2013\u0394Ex3 was found constitutively in the nucleus while SURVIVIN\u20132B was distributed along the chromosomes during mitosis and also to the mitotic spindle poles. We used inducible shRNA against SURVIVIN to inhibit expression in a titratable fashion. Using this system, we reduced the mRNA levels of these three variants to approx. 40%, resulting in a concomitant reduction of OCT4 and NANOG mRNA, suggesting a role for the SURVIVIN variants in pluripotency.",

The dynamic expression of de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) is essential to ESCs; however, the regulatory mechanism of Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b expression in ESCs is still poorly understood. Here, we reported that decreased expression of microRNA-495 (miR-495) in the first 2\u00a0days of embryoid body (EB) formation was required for mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) differentiation because repressed mesoderm and endoderm lineages were detected in ectopic miR-495 expression mESCs. This effect was reversed by the function blockade of miR-495. We identified Dnmt3a as a functional target of miR-495 and showed that endogenous miR-495 repressed the expression of Dnmt3a in mESCs. Furthermore, the effect of miR-495 on mESCs could be eliminated by Dnmt3a overexpression. Moreover, miR-495 had no effect on the expression of Dnmt3b despite the findings obtained from previous studies that mainly focused on the common characteristics of the regulatory mechanisms of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b expression. Thus, our studies not only uncovered a previously uncharacterized function of miR-495 in mESC differentiation but also generated a new idea to explore the mechanisms governing the functional difference between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b.",

Compared to LEPCs alone, spheres formed by LEPC+LNC exhibited higher clonal growth and less corneal epithelial differentiation. Furthermore, pSmad1/5/8 was in the nucleus of LEPCs, but not LNCs, and correlated with upregulation of BMP1, BMP3, BMP4, all three BMP receptors, and BMP target genes. Inactivation of BMP signaling in LNCs was correlated with upregulation of noggin preferentially expressed by LNCs. Additionally, \u03b2-catenin was stabilized in the perinuclear cytoplasm in LEPCs and correlated with upregulation of Wnt7A and FZD5 preferentially expressed by LEPCs. Inactivation of Wnt signaling in LNCs was correlated with upregulation of DKK1/2 by LNCs. Addition of XAV939 that expectedly downregulated perinuclear \u03b2-catenin in LEPCs led to significant reduction of epithelial clonal growth, but upregulated all three BMP receptors and downregulated LNC-derived noggin, resulting in activation of BMP signaling in LNCs. Addition of noggin that expectedly downregulated nuclear localization of pSmad1/5/8 in LEPCs led to nuclear localization of \u03b2-catenin in larger LEPCs but membrane relocation of \u03b2-catenin in smaller LEPCs and significant upregulation of DKK1/2.

An enrichment in the number of PCSC expressing the cell surface marker CD133 and a marked enhancement on tumorsphere formation was observed in gemcitabine treated tumors. No significant increase in the CD44, CD24, and epithelial-specific antigen (ESA) positive cells was observed. Neoplastic sphere-forming cells were susceptible to adenoviral infection and exposure to oncolytic adenoviruses resulted in elevated cytotoxicity with both Adwt and the tumor specific AduPARE1A adenovirus. In vivo, intravenous administration of a single dose of AduPARE1A in human-derived pancreatic xenografts led to a remarkable anti-tumor effect. In contrast to gemcitabine AduPARE1A treatment did not result in PCSC enrichment. No enrichment on tumorspheres neither on the CD133+ population was detected.

We defined the polymerization and degradation rates and compressive moduli of 25 hydrogels formulated from different concentrations of hyaluronic acid (HA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Changes in compressive modulus were driven primarily by the HA concentration. The in vitro biocompatibility of fetal-derived (fNPC) and adult-derived (aNPC) neural progenitor cells was dependent on hydrogel formulation. Acute survival of fNPC benefited from hydrogel encapsulation. NPC differentiation was divergent: fNPC differentiated into mostly glial cells, compared with neuronal differentiation of aNPC. Differentiation was influenced in part by the hydrogel mechanical properties. This study indicates that there can be a wide range of HA and PEG hydrogels compatible with NPC. Additionally, this is the first study comparing hydrogel encapsulation of NPC derived from different aged sources, with data suggesting that fNPC and aNPC respond dissimilarly within the same hydrogel formulation.",

Functional assays show that HSC and hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are significantly reduced in cKO aorta and placenta.

CD can convert the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) to its active chemotherapeutic form, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which induces a tumor-killing effect through DNA synthesis inhibition. IFN-\u03b2 also strongly inhibits tumor growth by the apoptotic process. RT-PCR confirmed that HB1.F3.CD cells expressed CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells expressed both CD and IFN-\u03b2. A modified transwell migration assay showed that HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells selectively migrated toward MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. In hNSC-breast cancer co-cultures the viability of breast cancer cells which were significantly reduced by HB1.F3.CD or HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells in the presence of 5-FC. The tumor inhibitory effect was greater with the HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 cells, indicating an additional effect of IFN-\u03b2 to 5-FU. In addition, the tumor-tropic properties of these hNSCs were found to be attributed to chemoattractant molecules secreted by breast cancer cells, including stem cell factor (SCF), c-kit, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and VEGF receptor 2. An in vivo assay performed using MDA-MB-231/luc breast cancer mammary fat pad xenografts in immunodeficient mice resulted in 50% reduced tumor growth and increased long-term survival in HB1.F3.CD and HB1.F3.CD.IFN-\u03b2 plus 5-FC treated mice relative to controls.

In the present study, we search for cardiogenic secreted factors that could be regulated by TAp63 and, by ChIP-seq analysis, identified Angiomodulin (AGM), also named IGFBP7 or IGFBP-rP1. We demonstrate that AGM is necessary for cardiac commitment of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and its regulation depends on TAp63 isoform. TAp63 directly activates both AGM and Activin-A during ESC cardiogenesis while these secreted factors modulate TAp63 gene expression by a feedback loop mechanism.

In the present study, S1P1\u20135 receptors were expressed in mouse ES cells and S1P increased S1P1\u20133 receptor expression level. S1P treatment stimulated the cellular proliferation in S1P1/3-dependent manner, located in lipid rafts. In response to S1P, \u03b2-arrestin was recruited to S1P1/3 receptor and c-Src was activated. S1P also increased the binding of S1P1/3 receptor with Flk-1. Similar to responses for VEGF, S1P increased Flk-1 phosphorylation, which was blocked by \u03b2-arrestin siRNA, and PP2, but not by VEGF-A164 antibody or VEGF siRNA. In addition, S1P induced VEGF expression and VEGFR2 kinase inhibitor (SU1498) blocked the S1P-induced cellular proliferation. However, VEGF-A164 antibody or VEGF siRNA partially blocked S1P-induced cellular proliferation, suggesting that both VEGF-dependent Flk-1 activation and VEGF-independent Flk-1 activation are involved in S1P-induced ES cell proliferation. S1P and VEGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK and JNK were blocked by pretreatment with SU1498. Moreover, inhibition of ERK and JNK blocked S1P-induced cellular proliferation. In conclusion, S1P-elicited transactivation of Flk-1 mediated by S1P1/3-dependent \u03b2-arrestin/c-Src pathways stimulated mouse ES cell proliferation.",

     "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to isolate cancer stem cells (CSCs, also called tumor-initiating cells, TICs) from established human colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cell lines, characterize them extensively and dissect the mechanism for their stemness. Freshly isolated CD44+ and CD44\u2212 cells from the HCT-15 human colon cancer cell line were subjected to various analyses. Interestingly, CD44+ cells exhibited higher soft agar colony-forming ability and in vivo tumorigenicity than CD44\u2212 cells. In addition, the significant upregulation of the protein Snail and the downregulation of miR-203, a stemness inhibitor, in CD44+ cells suggested that this population possessed higher invasion/metastasis and differentiation potential than CD44\u2212 cells. By manipulating the expression of CD44 in HCT-15 and HCT-116 cells, we found that the levels of several EMT activators and miR-203 were positively and negatively correlated with those of CD44, respectively. Further analyses revealed that miR-203 levels were repressed by Snail, which was shown to bind to specific E-box(es) present in the miR-203 promoter. In agreement, silencing miR-203 expression in wild-type HCT-116 human colon cancer cells also resulted in an increase of their stemness. Finally, we discovered that c-Src kinase activity was required for the downregulation of miR-203 in HCT-15 cells, which was stimulated by the interaction between hyaluronan (HA) and CD44.Taken together, CD44 is a critical molecule for modulating stemness in CSCs. More importantly, we show for the first time that the downregulation of miR-203 by HA/CD44 signaling is the main reason for stemness-maintenance in colon cancer cells.",

     "abstract": "Molecular genetic studies are typically performed on homogenized biological samples, resulting in contamination from non-neuronal cells. To improve expression profiling of neurons we combined patch recordings with single-cell PCR. Two iPSC lines (healthy subject and 22q11.2 deletion) were differentiated into neurons. Patch electrode recordings were performed on 229 human cells from Day-13 to Day-88, followed by capture and single-cell PCR for 13 genes: ACTB, HPRT, vGLUT1, \u03b2TUBIII, COMT, DISC1, GAD1, PAX6, DTNBP1, ERBB4, FOXP1, FOXP2, and GIRK2. Neurons derived from both iPSC lines expressed \u03b2TUBIII, fired action potentials, and experienced spontaneous depolarizations (UP states) ~\u00a02\u00a0weeks before vGLUT1, GAD1 and GIRK2 appeared. Multisite calcium imaging revealed that these UP states were not synchronized among hESC-H9-derived neurons. The expression of FOXP1, FOXP2 and vGLUT1 was lost after 50\u00a0days in culture, in contrast to other continuously expressed genes. When gene expression was combined with electrophysiology, two subsets of genes were apparent; those irrelevant to spontaneous depolarizations (including vGLUT1, GIRK2, FOXP2 and DISC1) and those associated with spontaneous depolarizations (GAD1 and ERBB4). The results demonstrate that in the earliest stages of neuron development, it is useful to combine genetic analysis with physiological characterizations, on a cell-to-cell basis.",

In particular, it still remains unclear whether and how ROS control the self-renewal/differentiation process and the tumor-initiating capacity of CSCs. Here we show that ROS-mediated activation of p38 MAPK plays a pivotal role in the control of differentiation and tumor-initiating capacity of glioma-initiating cells (GICs) derived from human glioblastomas. Mechanistically, ROS triggered p38-dependent Bmi1 protein degradation and FoxO3 activation in GICs, which were shown to be responsible for the loss of their self-renewal capacity and differentiation, respectively. Thus, the results suggest that Bmi1 and FoxO3 govern distinct phases of transition from undifferentiated to fully differentiated cells. Furthermore, we also demonstrate in this study that oxidative stress deprives GICs of their tumor-initiating capacity through the activation of the ROS\u2013p38 axis. As such, this is the first study to the best of our knowledge to delineate how ROS control self-renewal/differentiation and the tumor-initiating capacity of stem-like cancer cells. This study also suggests that targeting of the ROS\u2013p38 axis could be a novel approach in the development of therapeutic strategies against gliomas, represented by glioblastoma.",

We observed that all patients had sustained hematopoietic engraftment without any adverse UC-MSC infusion-related events. Furthermore, we did not observe any increase in severe aGVHD.

To determine whether JNKs are required for stem cell self-renewal or differentiation, we performed a phosphorylation kinase array assay to compare mouse ES cells under LIF\u00a0+ or LIF\u00a0\u2212 culture conditions. The data showed that activation of JNKs was induced by LIF withdrawal. We also found that JNK1 or 2 phosphorylated Klf4 at threonines 224 and 225.

     "abstract": "Today, the tool that is most commonly used to evaluate the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) in vitro is the demonstration of the expression of multiple relevant markers, such as ALP, RUNX2 and OCN. However, as yet, there is no single surface marker or panel of markers which clearly defines human BMSCs (hBMSCs) differentiating towards the osteogenic lineage. The aim of this study was therefore to examine this issue.Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative proteomics was utilized to investigate differently expressed surface markers in osteogenically differentiated and undifferentiated hBMSCs. Labeled membrane proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) and 52 proteins with an expression ratio above 2, between osteogenically differentiated and undifferentiated cells, were identified. Subsequent validation, by flow cytometry and ELISA, of the SILAC expression ratios for a number of these proteins and investigations of the lineage specificity of three candidate markers were performed.The surface markers, CD10 and CD92, demonstrated significantly increased expression in hBMSCs differentiated towards the osteogenic and adipogenic lineages. In addition, there was a slight increase in CD10 expression during chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, the expression of the intracellular protein, crystalline-\u03b1B (CRYaB), was only significantly increased in osteogenically differentiated hBMSCs and not affected during differentiation towards the chondrogenic or adipogenic lineages.It has been concluded from the present results that CD10 and CD92 are potential markers of osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation and that CRYaB is a potential novel osteogenic marker specifically expressed during the osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs in vitro.",

     "abstract": "In vitro stimulation of HSCs with growth factors generally leads to their depletion. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying expansion of HSCs in vivo following myeloablation could lead to successful expansion of HSCs ex vivo for therapeutic purposes. Current findings show that mTORC1 is activated in HSPCs following 5-fluorouracil treatment and that mTORC1 activation is dependent on mitochondrial ETC capacity of HSPCs. Moreover, expression of PGC-1 family members, proteins that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, in HSPCs following 5-fluorouracil treatment changes; also, these proteins play a stage specific role in hematopoietic recovery. While PRC regulates HSCs' expansion during early recovery phase, PGC-1\u03b1 regulates progenitor cell proliferation and recovery of hematopoiesis during later phase. During early recovery phase, PRC expression, mitochondrial activity and mTORC1 activation are relatively higher in PGC-1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 HSCs compared to WT HSCs, and PGC-1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 HSCs show greater expansion. Administration of rapamycin, but not NAC, during early recovery phase improves WT HSC numbers but decreases PGC-1\u03b1\u2212/\u2212 HSC numbers. The current findings demonstrate that mTOR activation can increase HSC numbers provided that the energy demand created by mTOR activation is successfully met. Thus, critical tuning between mTORC1 activation and mitochondrial ETC capacity is crucial for HSC maintenance/expansion in response to mitogenic stimulation.",

HESCs were differentiated into fetal-like pancreatic cells in vitro using a 33-day, 7-stage protocol. Cultures were ~\u00a090\u201395% PDX1-positive by day (d) 11 and 70\u201375% NKX6.1-positive by d17. Polyhormonal cells were scattered at d17, but developed into islet-like clusters that expressed key transcription factors by d33. Human C-peptide and glucagon secretion were first detected at d17 and increased thereafter in parallel with INS and GCG transcript levels. HESC-derived cells were responsive to KCl and arginine, but not glucose in perifusion studies. Compared to adult human islets, hESC-derived cells expressed ~\u00a010-fold higher levels of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) mRNA, but similar levels of glucokinase (GCK). In situ hybridization confirmed the presence of GLUT1 transcript within endocrine cells. However, GLUT1 protein was excluded from this population and was instead observed predominantly in non-endocrine cells, whereas GCK was co-expressed in insulin-positive cells. In rubidium efflux assays, hESC-derived cells displayed mild potassium channel activity, but no responsiveness to glucose, metabolic inhibitors or glibenclamide. Western blotting experiments revealed that the higher molecular weight SUR1 band was absent in hESC-derived cells, suggesting a lack of functional KATP channels at the cell surface. In addition, KATP channel subunit transcript levels were not at a 1:1 ratio, as would be expected (SUR1 levels were ~\u00a05-fold lower than KIR6.2). Various ratios of SUR1:KIR6.2 plasmids were transfected into COSM6 cells and rubidium efflux was found to be particularly sensitive to a reduction in SUR1. These data suggest that an impaired ratio of SUR1:KIR6.2 may contribute to the observed KATP channel defects in hESC-derived islet endocrine cells, and along with lack of GLUT1, may explain the absence of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion.",

Here, we analyzed the proliferative capacity of neural stem cells (NSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from Exo1\u2212/\u2212 mice. Our study shows that Exo1 deficiency impairs the maintenance of genomic stability and proliferative capacity in NSCs but not HSCs.

Our data provide experimental evidence that Exo1 deficiency has a differential impact on the homeostasis and proliferative capacity of tissue stem cells in the brain and bone marrow, suggesting that different tissue stem cells utilize distinct mechanisms for maintaining their genomic stability.

The mRNA and protein levels of Wnt3a, \u03b2-catenin, and Runx2 were upregulated while those of GSK-3\u03b2 were downregulated after HBO treatment. The relative density ratio (phospho-protein/protein) of Akt and GSK-3\u03b2 was both up-regulated while that of \u03b2-catenin was down-regulated after HBO treatment. We next investigated whether HBO affects the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin. Our Western blot analysis showed increased levels of translocated \u03b2-catenin that stimulated the expression of target genes after HBO treatment. HBO increased TCF-dependent transcription, Runx2 promoter/Luc gene activity, and the expression of osteogenic markers of BMSCs, such as alkaline phosphatase activity, type I collagen, osteocalcin, calcium, and the intensity of Alizarin Red staining. HBO dose dependently increased the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP2) and osterix production. We further demonstrated that HBO increased the expression of vacuolar-ATPases, which stimulated Wnt3a secretion from BMSCs. Finally, we showed that the beneficial effects of HBO on bone formation were related to Wnt3a/\u03b2-catenin signaling in a rabbit model by histology, mechanical testing, and immunohistochemical assays.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, Ahr ablation in mice and studies with orthologous genes in invertebrates suggest that AHR may also play a significant role in embryonic development. To address this hypothesis, we studied the regulation of Ahr expression in mouse embryonic stem cells and their differentiated progeny. In ES cells, interactions between OCT3/4, NANOG, SOX2 and Polycomb Group proteins at the Ahr promoter repress AHR expression, which can also be repressed by ectopic expression of reprogramming factors in hepatoma cells. In ES cells, unproductive RNA polymerase II binds at the Ahr transcription start site and drives the synthesis of short abortive transcripts. Activation of Ahr expression during differentiation follows from reversal of repressive marks in Ahr promoter chromatin, release of pluripotency factors and PcG proteins, binding of Sp factors, establishment of histone marks of open chromatin, and engagement of active RNAPII to drive full-length RNA transcript elongation. Our results suggest that reversible Ahr repression in ES cells holds the gene poised for expression and allows for a quick switch to activation during embryonic development.",

Previous studies have reported that thymosin beta 4 (Tmsb4x) is closely related to the initiation and development of the tooth germ. We herein attempted to establish odontogenic epithelial cells from non-odontogenic HaCaT cells by transfection with TMSB4X. TMSB4X-transfected cells formed nodules that were positive for Alizarin-red S (ALZ) and von Kossa staining (calcium phosphate deposits) when cultured in calcification-inducing medium. Three selected clones showing larger amounts of calcium deposits than the other clones, expressed PITX2, Cytokeratin 14, and Sonic Hedgehog. The upregulation of odontogenesis-related genes, such as runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), Amelogenin (AMELX), Ameloblastin (AMBN) and Enamelin (ENAM) was also detected. These proteins were immunohistochemically observed in nodules positive for the ALZ and von Kossa staining. RUNX2-positive selected TMSB4X-transfected cells implanted into the dorsal subcutaneous tissue of nude mice formed matrix deposits. Immunohistochemically, AMELX, AMBN and ENAM were observed in the matrix deposits. This study demonstrated the possibility of induction of dental epithelial cell differentiation marker gene expression in non-odontogenic HaCaT cells by TMSB4X.",

     "abstract": "The direct lineage reprogramming of somatic cells to other lineages by defined factors has led to innovative cell-fate-change approaches for providing patient-specific cells. Recent reports have demonstrated that four pluripotency factors (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc) are sufficient to directly reprogram fibroblasts to other specific cells, including induced neural stem cells (iNSCs). Here, we show that mouse fibroblasts can be directly reprogrammed into midbrain dopaminergic neuronal progenitors (DPs) by temporal expression of the pluripotency factors and environment containing sonic hedgehog and fibroblast growth factor 8. Within thirteen days, self-renewing and functional induced DPs (iDPs) were generated. Interestingly, the inhibition of both Jak and Gsk3\u03b2 notably enhanced the iDP reprogramming efficiency. We confirmed the functionality of the iDPs by showing that the dopaminergic neurons generated from iDPs express midbrain markers, release dopamine, and show typical electrophysiological profiles. Our results demonstrate that the pluripotency factors-mediated direct reprogramming is an invaluable strategy for supplying functional and proliferating iDPs and may be useful for other neural progenitors required for disease modeling and cell therapies for neurodegenerative disorders.",

In vitro studies have shown that FLK1+ cells derived from embryonic stem (ES) cells can differentiate into both endothelial and smooth muscle cells. These FLK1+ cells also contain a mesodermal precursor, the hemangioblast, able to produce endothelial, blood and smooth muscle cells. The generation of blood precursors from the hemangioblast was recently shown to occur through a transient cell population of specialised endothelium, a hemogenic endothelium. To date, the lineage relationship between this cell population and smooth muscle cell progenitors has not been investigated. In this study, we generated a reporter ES cell line in which expression of the fluorescent protein H2B-VENUS is driven by the \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) regulatory sequences. We demonstrated that this reporter cell line efficiently trace smooth muscle development during ES cell differentiation. Although some smooth muscle cells are associated with broad endothelial development, we established that smooth muscle cells are mostly generated independently from a specialised functional hemogenic endothelium. This study provides new and important insights into hematopoietic and vascular development, which may help in driving further progress towards the development of bioengineered vascular grafts for regenerative medicine.",

The success of such a therapy relies upon producing a population of functional neurons from stem cells, to enable precise encoding of sound information to the brainstem. Using our established differentiation assay to produce sensory neurons from human stem cells, patch-clamp recordings indicated that all neurons examined generated action potentials and displayed both transient sodium and sustained potassium currents. Stem cell-derived neurons reliably entrained to stimuli up to 20 pulses per second (pps), with 50% entrainment at 50 pps. A comparison with cultured primary auditory neurons indicated similar firing precision during low-frequency stimuli, but significant differences after 50 pps due to differences in action potential latency and width. The firing properties of stem cell-derived neurons were also considered relative to time in culture (31\u201356\u00a0days) and revealed no change in resting membrane potential, threshold or firing latency over time. Thus, while stem cell-derived neurons did not entrain to high frequency stimulation as effectively as mammalian auditory neurons, their electrical phenotype was stable in culture and consistent with that reported for embryonic auditory neurons.",

Recently, a combination of TGF\u03b2 and Wnt activation with BMP inhibition improved DE induction in embryoid bodies cultured in suspension. Based on these observations we developed a protocol to efficiently induce DE cells in monolayer cultures of mESCs. We obtained a good cell yield with 54.92% DE induction as shown by Foxa2, Sox17, Cxcr4 and E-Cadherin expression. These DE-cells could be further differentiated into posterior foregut and pancreatic phenotypes using a culture protocol initially developed for human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation. In addition, this mESC-derived DE gave rise to hepatocyte-like cells after exposure to BMP and FGF ligands. Our data therefore indicate a substantial improvement of monolayer DE induction from mESCs and support the concept that differentiation conditions for mESC-derived DE are similar to those for hESCs. As mESCs are easier to maintain and manipulate in culture compared to hESCs, and considering the shorter duration of embryonic development in the mouse, this method of efficient DE induction on monolayer will promote the development of new differentiation protocols to obtain DE-derivatives, like pancreatic beta-cells, for future use in cell replacement therapies.",

This approach is controversial and evidence in large animals is missing. Side effects of MSC infusion such as the contribution to a fibrotic process have been reported in experimental settings. Nevertheless, MSCs moved quickly from bench to bedside and over 280 clinical trials are registered, of which 28 focus on the treatment of liver diseases.

Neurons generated in the SVZ migrate along the rostral migratory stream to reach the olfactory bulb. Brain injuries stimulate SVZ neurogenesis and direct migration of new progenitors to the sites of injury. To date, cortical injury-induced adult SVZ neurogenesis in mice remains ambiguous and migration of neural progenitors to the site of injury has not been studied in detail. Here we report that aspiration lesion in the motor cortex induces a transient, but significant increase in the proliferation as well as neurogenesis in the SVZ. New neural progenitors migrate ectopically to the injured area with the assistance of blood vessels and reactive astrocytes. The SVZ origin of these progenitors was further confirmed using lentiviral transduction. In addition, we show that astrocyte-assisted ectopic migration is regulated by CXCR4/SDF-1 signaling pathway. Finally, upon reaching the lesion area, these progenitors differentiate mainly into glial cells and, to a lesser extent, mature neurons. These data provide a detailed account of the changes occurring in the SVZ and the cortex following lesion, and indicate the potential of the endogenous neural progenitors in cortical repair.",

     "abstract": "Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) are emerging as an attractive alternative source for cell replacement therapy since the cells can be expanded in culture indefinitely and differentiated into any cell types in the body. In order to optimize cell-to-cell interaction, cell proliferation and differentiation into specific lineages as well as tissue organization, it is important to provide a microenvironment for the hESCs which mimics the stem cell niche. One approach is to provide a three-dimensional (3D) environment such as encapsulation. We present an approach to culture and differentiate hESCs into midbrain dopamine (mdDA) neurons in a 3D microenvironment using alginate microcapsules for the first time. A detailed gene and protein expression analysis during neuronal differentiation showed an increased gene and protein expression of various specific DA neuronal markers, particularly tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) by >\u00a0100 folds after 2\u00a0weeks and at least 50% higher expression after 4\u00a0weeks respectively, compared to cells differentiated under conventional two-dimensional (2D) platform. The encapsulated TH+ cells co-expressed mdDA neuronal markers, forkhead box protein A-2 (FOXA2) and pituitary homeobox-3 (PITX3) after 4\u00a0weeks and secreted approximately 60\u00a0pg/ml/106 cells higher DA level when induced. We propose that the 3D platform facilitated an early onset of DA neuronal generation compared to that with conventional 2D system which also secretes more DA under potassium-induction. It is a very useful model to study the proliferation and directed differentiation of hESCs to various lineages, particularly to mdDA neurons. This 3D system also allows the separation of feeder cells from hESCs during the process of differentiation and also has potential for immune-isolation during transplantation studies.",

Here, we describe an in vitro sphere culture system to isolate the DESCs from postnatal mouse incisor cervical loops (CLs) where the DESCs are thought to reside. The dissociated cells from CLs were able to expand and form spheres for multiple generations in the culture system. Lineage tracing indicated that DESC within the spheres were epithelial in origin as evident by lineage tracing. Upon stimulation, the sphere cells differentiated into cytokeratin 14- and amelogenin-expressing and mineral material-producing cells. Compared to the CL tissue, sphere cells expressed high levels of expression of Sca-1, CD49f (also designated as integrin \u03b16), and CD44. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analyses of mouse incisor CL cells further showed that the CD49fBright population was enriched in sphere-forming cells. In addition, the CD49fBright population includes both slow-cycling and Lgr5+ DESCs. The in vitro sphere culture system and identification of CD49fBright as a DESC marker provide a novel platform for enriching DESCs, interrogating how maintenance, cell fate determination, and differentiation of DESCs are regulated, and developing tooth regenerative therapies.",

Although ECs can support the regeneration of otherwise lethally-irradiated HSCs, the mechanisms are not well understood. To further understand this phenomenon, we studied HSC regeneration from irradiated bone marrow using co-culture with human aortic ECs (HAECs). Co-culture with HAECs induced a 24-fold expansion of long-term HSCs (CD150+, lineagelo, Sca-1+, c-Kit+; CD150+LSK cells) in vitro. These cells gave rise to functional hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with colony-forming activity, multilineage reconstitution and serial transplantation potential. Furthermore, HAECs significantly reduced DNA damage in irradiated LSK cells within 24\u00a0h. Remarkably, we were able to delay the exposure of irradiated bone marrow to the regenerative, HAEC-derived signals for up to 48\u00a0h and still rescue functional HSCs. G-CSF is the gold standard for promoting hematopoietic regeneration in vivo. However, when compared to HAECs, in vitro G-CSF treatment promoted lineage differentiation and regenerated 5-fold fewer CD150+LSK cells. Together, our results show that HAECs are powerful, direct mitigators of HSC injury and DNA damage.

Characterization of the mechanisms enabling survival and expansion of abnormal hESCs is important due to consequences of genetic changes for the therapeutic utilization of stem cells. Furthermore, these cells provide an excellent model to study transformation in vitro. We report here that the histone deacetylase proteins, HDAC1 and HDAC2, are increased in karyotypically abnormal hESCs when compared to their normal counterparts. Importantly, similar to many cancer cell lines, we found that HDAC inhibitors repress proliferation of the karyotypically abnormal hESCs, whereas normal cells are more resistant to the treatment. The decreased proliferation correlates with downregulation of HDAC1 and HDAC2 proteins, induction of the proliferation inhibitor, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and altered regulation of tumor suppressor protein Retinoblastoma 1 (RB1). Through genome-wide transcriptome analysis we have identified genes with altered expression and responsiveness to HDAC inhibition in abnormal cells. Most of these genes are linked to severe developmental and neurological diseases and cancers. Our results highlight the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in the regulation of genomic stability of hESCs, and provide valuable candidates for targeted and selective growth inhibition of karyotypically abnormal cells.",

In the present study, we have identified Zfp819, a KRAB-zinc finger protein, as a novel pluripotency-related factor and characterized its role in pluripotent stem cells. We show that Zfp819 is expressed highly in various types of pluripotent stem cells but not in their differentiated counterparts. We identified the presence of non-canonical nuclear localization signals in particular zinc finger motifs and identified them as responsible for the nuclear localization of Zfp819. Analysis of the Zfp819 promoter region revealed the presence of a transcriptionally active chromatin signature. Moreover, we confirmed the binding of pluripotency-related factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog to the distal promoter region of Zfp819, indicating that the expression of this gene is regulated by a pluripotency transcription factor network. We found that the expression of endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs) such as Intracisternal A Particle (IAP) retrotransposons, Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements (LINE1), and Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINE B1) is significantly upregulated in Zfp819-knockdown (Zfp819_KD) cells. In line with the activation of ERVs, we observed the occurrence of spontaneous DNA damage in Zfp819_KD cells. Furthermore, we tested whether Zfp819 can interact with KAP1, a KRAB-associated protein with a transcriptional repression function, and found the interaction between these two proteins in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. The challenging of Zfp819_KD cells with DNA damaging agent revealed that these cells are inefficient in repairing the damaged DNA, as cells showed presence of \u03b3H2A.X foci for a prolonged time. Collectively, our study identified Zfp819 as a novel pluripotency-related factor and unveiled its function in genomic integrity maintenance mechanisms of mouse embryonic stem cells.",

     "abstract": "The outcomes of clinical trials using bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) are variable; the degree of the expansion of BMSCs during clinical manufacturing may contribute to this variability since cell expansion is limited by senescence. Human BMSCs from aspirates of healthy subjects were subcultured serially until cell growth stopped. Phenotype and functional measurements of BMSCs from two subjects including senescence-associated beta-galactosidase staining and colony formation efficiency changed from an early to a senescence pattern at passage 6 or 7. Transcriptome analysis of 10 early and 15 late passage BMSC samples from 5 subjects revealed 2122 differentially expressed genes, which were associated with immune response, development, and cell proliferation pathways. Analysis of 57 serial BMSC samples from 7 donors revealed that the change from an early to senescent profile was variable among subjects and occurred prior to changes in phenotypes. BMSC age expressed as a percentage of maximum population doublings (PDs) was a good indicator for an early or senescence transcription signature but this measure of BMSC life span can only be calculated after expanding BMSCs to senescence. In order to find a more useful surrogate measure of BMSC age, we used a computational biology approach to identify a set of genes whose expression at each passage would predict elapsed age of BMSCs. A total of 155 genes were highly correlated with BMSC age. A least angle regression algorithm identified a set of 24 BMSC age-predictive genes. In conclusion, the onset of senescence-associated molecular changes was variable and preceded changes in other indicators of BMSC quality and senescence. The 24 BMSC age predictive genes will be useful in assessing the quality of clinical BMSC products.",

However, the number of HSCs in UCB is limited, and attempts to amplify them in vitro remain inefficient. Several publications have documented amplification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) on endothelial or mesenchymal cells, but the lack of homogeneity in culture conditions and HSC definition impairs direct comparison of these results. We investigated the ability of different feeder layers, mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) and endothelial cells (ECs), to amplify hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Placental derived HSPCs (defined as Lin\u2212CD45\u2212/dimCD34+CD38\u2212CD90+) were maintained on confluent feeder layers and the number of cells and their marker expression were monitored over 21\u00a0days. Although both types of feeder layers supported hematopoietic expansion, only endothelial cells triggered amplification of Lin\u2212CD45\u2212/dimCD34+CD38\u2212CD90+ cells, which peaked at 14\u00a0days. The amplified cells differentiated into all cell lineages, as attested by in vitro colony-forming assays, and were capable of engraftment and multi-lineage differentiation in sub-lethally irradiated mice. Mesenchymal progenitors promoted amplification of CD38+ cells, previously defined as precursors with more limited differentiation potential. A competitive assay demonstrated that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells had a preference for interacting with endothelial cells in vitro. Cytokine and transcriptomic analysis of both feeder cell types identified differences in gene expression that correlated with propensity of ECs and MPs to support hematopoietic cell amplification and differentiation respectively. Finally, we used RNA sequencing of endothelial cells and HSPCs to uncover relevant networks illustrating the complex interaction between endothelial cells and HSPCs leading to stem/progenitor cell expansion.",

Together with qRT-PCR analysis, our data illustrated that primitive NSCs retained expression of key pluripotency genes Oct4 and Nanog, while exhibiting repression of other pluripotency-related genes Zscan4, Foxp1 and Dusp9 and up-regulation of neural markers Sox1 and Hes1. The early differentiation feature in primitive NSCs was also supported by their intermediate characters on cell cycle profiles. Moreover, re-plating primitive NSCs back to ESC culture condition could reverse them back to ESC stage, as shown by reversible regulation of marker genes, cell cycle profile changes and enhanced embryoid body formation. In addition, our microarray analysis also identified genes differentially expressed in primitive NSCs, and loss-of-function analysis demonstrated that Hes1 and Ccdc141 play important function at this stage, opening up an opportunity to further understand the regulation of early neural commitment.",

To optimize suspension conditions guided by a computational simulation, we developed a method to efficiently expand hiPSCs as undifferentiated aggregates in spinner flasks. Serial passaging of two different hiPSC lines in the spinner flasks using the E8 medium preserved their normal karyotype and expression of undifferentiated state markers of TRA-1\u201360, SSEA4, OCT4, and NANOG. The hiPSCs cultured in spinner flasks for more than 10 passages not only could be remained pluripotent as indicated by in vitro and in vivo assays, but also could be efficiently induced toward mesodermal and hematopoietic differentiation. Furthermore, we established a xeno-free protocol of single-cell cryopreservation and recovery for the scalable production of hiPSCs in spinner flasks.

     "abstract": "Although the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) functions as an important signaling complex in many cellular processes, the role of mTORC1 in neurons derived from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been less explored. Here, using a modified protocol to differentiate mouse ESCs (mESCs) into almost uniform glutamatergic neurons, we explored the importance of raptor/mTORC1 in the differentiation of mESCs. Raptor gene-trap mESCs, and raptor-knockdown mESCs formed smaller-sized embryonic bodies than the wild type and failed to undergo neuronal differentiation. Treatment with 1\u00a0\u03bcM rapamycin starting at the point when neuronal precursors began to differentiate from mESCs caused the gradual loss of neurites, shrinkage of soma, and a decreased ratio of neurite length to cell number over 48 to 72\u00a0h of treatment. This change was accompanied by activation of caspase-3 and S6 kinase (S6K), but not 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1). Knockdown of raptor during neuronal differentiation from mESCs also resulted in gradual loss of neurites and shrinkage of cell bodies. Loss of neurite density resulting from rapamycin treatment could be reversed by overexpression of S6K T389E. Taken together, these data demonstrate that raptor/mTORC1/S6K plays a critical role in the differentiation and survival of neurons derived from mESCs.",

Mutations of this protein are linked to laminopathies and specifically to Hutchinson\u2013Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), an accelerated aging disease. Some authors have proposed that a deregulation of LMNA affects the differentiation potential of stem cells.The chondrogenic potential is defective in PG-MSCs, although both PG and LMNA transduced MSCs, have an increase in hypertrophy markers during chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, both PG and LMNA-MSCs showed a decrease in manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSODM), an increase of mitochondrial MnSODM-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alterations in their migration capacity. Finally, defects in chondrogenesis are partially reversed by periodic incubation with ROS-scavenger agent that mimics MnSODM effect.Our results indicate that over-expression of LMNA or PG by lentiviral gene delivery leads to defects in chondrogenic differentiation potential partially due to an imbalance in oxidative stress.",

We found that mammary epithelial cells exposed to soy diet exhibited a lower percentage of CD29hiCD24+Lin\u2212 population, decreased ability to form mammospheres in culture, lower mammary outgrowth potential when transplanted into cleared fat pads, and reduced appearance of tumor-initiating CD29hiThy1+CD24+ cells, than in those of control diet-fed mice. Diet had no comparable influence on the percentage of the CD29loCD24+Lin\u2212 population. Global gene expression profiling of the CD29hiCD24+subpopulation revealed markedly altered expression of genes important to inflammation, cytokine and chemokine signaling, and proliferation. Soy-fed relative to casein-fed mice showed lower mammary tumor incidence, shorter tumor latency, and reduced systemic levels of estradiol 17-\u03b2, progesterone and interleukin-6. Our results provide evidence for the functional impact of diet on specific epithelial subpopulations that may relate to breast cancer risk and suggest that diet-regulated cues can be further explored for breast cancer risk assessment and prevention.",

The PKHhigh cells, capable of self-renewal and of generating a differentiated epithelial, endothelial and podocytic progeny, can also survive in vivo maintaining the undifferentiated status. The PKHhigh status, together with a CD133+/CD24\u2212 phenotype, identified a homogeneous cell population displaying in vitro self-renewal and multipotency capacity.

Therefore generation of a source of bfCNs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is crucial for in vitro disease modeling and development of novel AD therapies. In addition, for the advancement of regenerative approaches there is a requirement for an accurate developmental model to study the neurogenesis and survival of this population. Here we demonstrate the efficient production of bfCNs, using a novel embryoid body (EB) based non-adherent differentiation (NAdD) protocol. We establish a specific basal forebrain neural stem cell (NSC) phenotype via expression of the basal forebrain transcription factors NKX2.1 and LHX8, as well as the general forebrain marker FOXG1. We present evidence that this lineage is achieved via recapitulation of embryonic events, with induction of intrinsic hedgehog signaling, through the use of a 3D non-adherent differentiation system. This is the first example of hPSC-derived basal forebrain-like NSCs, which are scalable via self-renewal in prolonged culture. Furthermore upon terminal differentiation these basal forebrain-like NSCs generate high numbers of cholinergic neurons expressing the specific markers ChAT, VACht and ISL1. These hPSC-derived bfCNs possess characteristics that are crucial in a model to study AD related cholinergic neuronal loss in the basal forebrain. Examples are expression of the therapeutic target p75NTR, the release of acetylcholine, and demonstration of a mature, and functional electrophysiological profile. In conclusion, this work provides a renewable source of human functional bfCNs applicable for studying AD specifically in the cholinergic system, and also provides a model of the key embryonic events in human bfCN development.",

CD166neg lung stromal cells exhibit high proliferative potential with the capacity to differentiate along the lipofibroblastic and myofibroblastic lineages, whereas CD166pos lung stromal cells have limited proliferative potential and are committed to the myofibroblastic lineage. Moreover, we show that CD166pos lung stromal cells do not share the same epithelial-supportive capacity as their CD166neg counterparts, which support the growth of lung epithelial stem cell (EpiSPC) colonies in vitro. In addition, ex vivo expansion of lung stromal cells also resulted in the loss of epithelial-supportive capacity, which could be reinstated by inhibition of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway. We show that epithelial-supportive capacity correlated with the level of FGF-10 expression and the reactivation of several lung development-associated genes. In summary, these studies suggest that TGF-\u03b2 signaling in stromal cells acts upstream of FGF-10 to regulate epithelial stem cell growth in the adult lung.",

We investigated whether E-cad harbors unique molecular features in establishing or maintaining pluripotency. By using a gene replacement knock-in (ki) approach to express N-cadherin (N-cad) or E-cad/N-cad chimeric cadherins under the control of the E-cad locus, we show that all E-cad-depleted ki/ki ES cells are maintained in an undifferentiated state. Surprisingly, these cells retained key features of pluripotency, such as Nanog expression and full differentiation capacity in vitro and in vivo, whereas E-cad knockout (ko) ES cells irreversibly lost most of these features. Moreover, our results indicate that E-cad mediated adhesion is essential for iPS cell generation, since E-cad depleted fibroblasts were not reprogrammed. In contrast, N-cad efficiently supports somatic reprogramming similar to E-cad, and permits initiation of the crucial initial step of mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition. Thus, we show that cell adhesion and a robust pluripotent phenotype are ultimately connected. Since N-cad properly compensates for loss of E-cad, no specific \u2018cadherin code\u2019 is required.",

Embryonic stem cells provide a remarkable in vitro system to study HD and could have implications for understanding disease development and for therapeutic treatment. Here, we derive pluripotent stem cells from the mouse R6/1 HD model and demonstrate that repeated exposure to genotoxic agents inducing oxidative DNA damage gave a significant and dose dependent increase in somatic triplet expansion. Further investigation into specific steps of DNA repair revealed impaired double stranded break repair in exposed R6/1 cells, accompanied by the induction of apoptosis.

However interpretation of data from many of these studies has been complicated by the heterogeneous nature of cell populations under study and by the fact that the Notch pathway is active during embryogenesis prior to the development of the haematopoietic system. To define the role of Notch signalling in more precise cell populations during the early stages of haematopoietic development within the aorta\u2013gonad\u2013mesonephros (AGM) microenvironment we co-cultured differentiating ESCs on a stromal cell line derived from this region of the embryo. Our co-culture system had no effect on the production of FLK1+ mesoderm progenitor cells but promoted their subsequent haematopoietic differentiation. We assessed the role of Notch signalling on haematopoietic differentiation of isolated FLK1+ cells. Notch activity is dynamic and drops to basal levels as FLK1+ cells commit to a haematopoietic fate. Further reduction of Notch activity by the inducible expression of dominant negative MAML had no functional consequences. In contrast, induction of Notch activity using an inducible NotchIC expression system had an inhibitory effect on haematopoietic differentiation. We used a Cre-mediated recombination strategy whereby NotchIC-expressing cells were marked with the hCD2 receptor and observed a reduction in the number of multi-lineage and myeloid colonies derived from NotchIC+ compared to NotchIC\u2212 FLK1+ cells isolated from the same culture. We believe that our culture system represents a good model for haematopoietic development within the AGM microenvironment and our data suggest that haematopoietic commitment of FLK1+ cells in this setting occurs when Notch activity is below a specific threshold.",

Notably, commonly used reference genes, e.g. beta-actin (ACTB) and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) were among the most unstable genes.For normalization of gene expression data of OA-BMSCs the combined use of IPO8, TBP, and CASC3 gene is recommended.",

Embryonic stem (ES) cells have the potential to differentiate into different cell types including neurons; however, the contribution of miR-137 in the maintenance and differentiation of ES cells remains unknown. Here, we show that miR-137 is mainly expressed in ES cells at the mitotic phase of the cell cycle and highly upregulated during differentiation. We identify that ES cell transcription factors, Klf4 and Tbx3, are downstream targets of miR-137, and we show that endogenous miR-137 represses the 3\u2032 untranslated regions of Klf4 and Tbx3. Transfection of ES cells with mature miR-137 RNA duplexes led to a significant reduction in cell proliferation and the expression of Klf4, Tbx3, and other self-renewal genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased miR-137 expression accelerates differentiation of ES cells in vitro. Loss of miR-137 during ES cell differentiation significantly impeded neuronal gene expression and morphogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-137 regulates ES cell proliferation and differentiation by repressing the expression of downstream targets, including Klf4 and Tbx3.",

     "abstract": "Environmental factors affect self-renewal of stem cells by modulating the components of self-renewal networks. Heat shock, an environmental factor, induces heat shock factors (HSFs), which up-regulate stress response-related genes. However, the link of heat shock to self-renewal of stem cells has not been elucidated yet. Here, we present the direct link of heat shock to a core stem cell regulator, OCT4, in the self-renewal network through SAPK/JNK and HSF1 pathway. We first showed that heat shock initiated differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Gene expression analysis revealed that heat shock increased the expression of many genes involved in cellular processes related to differentiation of stem cells. We then examined the effects of HSFs induced by heat shock on core self-renewal factors. Among HSFs, heat shock induced mainly HSF1 in hESCs. The HSF1 repressed the expression of OCT4, leading to the differentiation of hESCs and the above differentiation-related gene expression change. We further examined the effects of the upstream MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinases of HSF1 on the repression of OCT4 expression by HSF1. Among the MAP kinases, SAPK/JNK controlled predominantly the repression of the OCT4 expression by HSF1. The direct link of heat shock to the core self-renewal regulator through SAPK/JNK and HSF1 provides a fundamental basis for understanding the effect of heat and other stresses involving activation of HSF1 on the self-renewal program and further controlling differentiation of hESCs in a broad spectrum of stem cell applications using these stresses.",

Here, we endeavored to observe the onset of population heterogeneity by conducting long-term continuous in vitro observation of human adult bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) populations, a subset of which has been shown to be stem cells (also known as bone marrow-derived MSCs). Semi-automated identification and tracking of cell division and migration enabled construction of cell lineage maps that incorporated cell morphology. We found that all BMSCs steadily grew larger over time; this growth was interrupted only when a cell divided, producing two equally sized, morphologically similar daughter cells. However, a finite probability existed that one or both of these daughters then continued to increase in size without dividing, apparently exiting the cell cycle. Thus, larger BMSCs are those cells that have exited the normal cell cycle. These results hold important implications for MSC in vitro culture expansion and biophysical sorting strategies.",

The objectives of this study were to assess the therapeutic potency of ATSC for bone formation in an ectopic mouse model and determine molecular differences by standardized comparison with BMSC. Although ATSC contained less CD146+ cells, exhibited better proliferation and displayed similar alkaline phosphatase activity upon osteogenic in vitro differentiation, cells did not develop into bone-depositing osteoblasts on \u03b2-TCP after 8\u00a0weeks in vivo. Additionally, ATSC expressed less BMP-2, BMP-4, VEGF, angiopoietin and IL-6 and more adiponectin mRNA, altogether suggesting insufficient osteochondral commitment and reduced proangiogenic activity. Chondrogenic pre-induction of ATSC/\u03b2-TCP constructs with TGF-\u03b2 and BMP-6 initiated ectopic bone formation in >\u00a075% of samples.

Significant increases in the proportion of nestin- and \u03b2-tubulin III-positive cells were detected after EB exposure to DNP, accompanied by enhanced glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and ATP-linked oxygen consumption, thought to mediate DNP-induced neural differentiation. DNP further protected ESCs from cell death, as indicated by reduced caspase-3 positive cells, and increased proliferation. Cell migration from EBs was significantly higher in DNP-treated EBs, and migrating cells were positive for nestin, \u00df-tubulin III and MAP2, similar to that observed with retinoic acid (RA)-treated EBs. Compared to RA, however, DNP exerted a marked neuritogenic effect on differentiating ESCs, increasing the average length and number of neurites per cell.

Hypoxic-preconditioning (PC) has been shown to enhance cell survival and differentiation of progenitor cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The purpose of this study was to determine whether pretreatment with PC prior to HI stimulates subventricular zone (SVZ) proliferation and neurogenesis in newborn piglets. One-day-old piglets were subjected to PC (8% O2/92% N2) for 3\u00a0h and 24\u00a0h later were exposed to HI produced by combination of hypoxia (5% FiO2) for a pre-defined period of 30\u00a0min and ischemia induced by a period of 10\u00a0min of hypotension.

Neurosphere assay revealed that preconditioning pretreatment increased the number of NSP-derived neurospheres in SVZ following HI compared to normoxic and HI controls. NSPs from preconditioned SVZ generated twice as many neurons and astrocytes in vitro. Injections with 5-Bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) after PC revealed a robust proliferative response within the SVZ that continued for one week. PC also increased neurogenesis in vivo, doublecortin positive cells with migratory profiles were observed streaming from the SVZ to striatum and neocortex.

In this study, we show that the Notch signaling pathway participates in the modulation of BMSCs to elicit their immuno-suppressive roles. In a murine lethal acute graft versus host disease (aGvHD) model, BMSCs deficient for RBP-J, the critical transcription factor mediating signaling from all four mammalian Notch receptors, failed to delay the development of the disease. RBP-J deficient BMSCs were not able to inhibit the proliferation and activation of allogenic T-cells. Moreover, RBP-J deficient BMSCs could not down-regulate the expression of MHC II and co-stimulation molecules CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells (DCs). The antigen presentation capacity of DCs co-cultured with RBP-J deficient BMSCs was not impaired in contrast to wild type BMSCs. Furthermore, we showed that the productions of IL-6 and PGE2, two critical molecules mediating the immuno-suppressive activities of BMSCs, were reduced significantly in RBP-J deficient BMSCs. Both of the two molecules were importantly involved in the regulation of BMSCs by Notch signaling. In conclusion, our data suggests that the immuno-suppressive effects of BMSCs in aGvHD are dependent on Notch-RBP-J signaling, which regulates the productions of IL-6 and PGE2.",

In contrast, astroglial substrate greatly accelerated neurodevelopmental processes of hiPSC-derived neurons. We have monitored the neural differentiation and maturation process for up to two months after plating hiPSC-derived neuroprogenitor cells (hNPCs) on laminin or astrocytes. We found that one week after plating hNPCs, there were 21-fold more newly differentiated neurons on astrocytes than on laminin. Two weeks after plating hNPCs, there were 12-fold more dendritic branches in neurons cultured on astrocytes than on laminin. Six weeks after plating hNPCs, the Na+ and K+ currents, as well as glutamate and GABA receptor currents, were 3-fold larger in neurons cultured on astrocytes than on laminin. And two months after plating hNPCs, the spontaneous synaptic events were 8-fold more in neurons cultured on astrocytes than on laminin.

The present study aimed to investigate whether co-transplantation of subventricular zone-derived NPCs with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) will enhance oligodendroglial differentiation of NPCs. In vitro, oligodendroglial differentiation was strongly enhanced by co-cultivation of NPCs with BMSCs or BMSC-conditioned medium. For in vivo experiments, adult Fischer 344 rats underwent cervical dorsal funiculus transections, immediately followed by grafting of 5-bromo-2\u2032-deoxyuridine (BrdU) pre-labeled syngeneic NPCs mixed with BMSCs isolated from adult bone marrow. Six weeks post-injury and grafting, BMSC-containing grafts filled the lesion cavity but did not enhance oligodendroglial differentiation of co-grafted NPCs. The failure of BMSCs to induce oligodendroglial differentiation in vivo coincided with a rapid upregulation of bone morphogenetic protein 2/4 (BMP2/4) around the injury site and in vitro data demonstrated that BMP2/4 can override the oligodendrogenic effects of BMSCs. Moreover, blocking BMP activity can rescue the effect of BMSCs on NPCs.

HSC isolated from the endosteum (eLSKSLAM) showed significantly increased hemopoietic cell proliferation while in co-culture with MM. Furthermore, eLSKSLAM progeny retained HSC potential, maintaining long-term multi-lineage reconstitution capacity in lethally ablated recipients. Increased hemopoietic cell proliferation was not MM contact dependent and could be recapitulated with media supplemented with two factors identified in MM-conditioned media: insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). We demonstrate that HSC express the receptor for IGF-1 and that IGF-1/IGFBP-3 induced increased hemopoietic cell proliferation can be blocked by an anti-IGF-1 neutralising antibody. However, co-cultures of 8N, 16N or 32N MM with eLSKSLAM showed that MM of individual ploidy did not significantly increase hemopoietic cell proliferation. Our data suggests that MM are an important component of the HSC niche and regulate hemopoietic cell proliferation through cytokine release.",

We have conducted a comprehensive comparative proteomic analysis of culture-expanded hBMSCs obtained from different human donors. The data reveal extensive donor-to-donor proteomic heterogeneity. Processing and database-searching of the tandem MS data resulted in a most comprehensive to date proteomic dataset for hBMSC. A total of 7753 proteins including 712 transcription and translation regulators, 384 kinases, 248 receptor proteins, and 29 cytokines were confidently identified. The proteins identified are mainly nuclear (43.2%) and the share of proteins assigned to more than one subcellular location constitutes 10% of the identified proteome. Bioinformatics tools (IPA, DAVID, and PANTHER) were used to annotate proteins with respect to cellular locations, functions, and other physicochemical characteristics. We also compared the proteomic profile of hBMSCs to recently compiled datasets for human and mouse pluripotent stem cells. The result shows the extent of similarity between the three cell populations and also identified 253 proteins expressed uniformly by all lines of hBMSCs but not reported in the proteomic datasets of the two pluripotent stem cells. Overall, the proteomic database reported in this paper can serve as a reference map for extensive evaluation of hBMSC to explain their biology as well as identify possible marker candidates for further evaluation.",

To study how mitochondrial function is impaired in BTHS patients, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to develop a novel and relevant human model system for BTHS. BTHS\u2013iPSCs generated from dermal fibroblasts of three patients with different mutations in TAZ1 expressed pluripotency markers, and were able to differentiate into cells derived from all three germ layers both in vitro and in vivo. We used these cells to study the impact of tafazzin deficiency on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. We found an impaired remodeling of cardiolipin, a dramatic decrease in basal oxygen consumption rate and in the maximal respiratory capacity in BTHS\u2013iPSCs. Simultaneous measurement of extra-cellular acidification rate allowed us a thorough assessment of the metabolic deficiency in BTHS patients. Blue native gel analyses revealed that decreased respiration coincided with dramatic structural changes in respiratory chain supercomplexes leading to a massive increase in generation of reactive oxygen species. Our data demonstrate that BTHS\u2013iPSCs are capable of modeling BTHS by recapitulating the disease phenotype and thus are important tools for studying the disease mechanism.",

     "abstract": "Fibronectin is a major extracellular matrix glycoprotein with several alternatively spliced variants, including extra domain A (EDA), which was demonstrated to promote tumorigenesis via stimulating angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. Given that CD133+/CD44+ cancer cells are critical in tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC), we hypothesize that fibronectin EDA may promote tumorigenesis by sustaining the properties of CD133+/CD44+ colon cancer cells. We found that tumor tissue and serum EDA levels are substantially higher in advanced versus early stage human CRC. Additionally we showed that tumor tissue EDA levels are positively correlated with differentiation status and chemoresistance, and correlated with a poor prognosis of CRC patients. We also showed that in colon cancer cells SW480, CD133+/CD44+ versus CD133\u2212/CD44\u2212 cells express significantly elevated EDA receptor integrin \u03b19\u03b21. Silencing EDA in SW480 cells reduces spheroid formation and cells positive for CD133 or CD44, which is associated with reduced expressions of embryonic stem cell markers and increased expressions of differentiation markers. Blocking integrin \u03b19\u03b21 function strongly reversed the effect of EDA overexpression. We also provided evidence suggesting that EDA sustains Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling activity via activating integrin/FAK/ERK pathway. In xenograft models, EDA-silenced SW480 cells exhibit reduced tumorigenic and metastatic capacity. In conclusion, EDA is essential for the maintenance of the properties of CD133+/CD44+ colon cancer cells.",

We used primary chondrocytes, ASCs from different sources and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) from OA donors. ASCs or MSCs were co-cultured with chondrocytes in a minimal medium and using cell culture inserts. Under these conditions, ASCs did not affect the proliferation of chondrocytes but significantly decreased camptothecin-induced apoptosis. Both MSCs and ASCs from different sources allowed chondrocytes in the cocultures maintaining a stable expression of markers specific for a mature phenotype, while expression of hypertrophic and fibrotic markers was decreased. A number of factors known to regulate the chondrocyte phenotype (IL-1\u03b2, IL-1RA, TNF-\u03b1) and matrix remodeling (TIMP-1 and -2, MMP-1 and -9, TSP-1) were not affected. However, a significant decrease of TGF-\u03b21 secretion by chondrocytes and induction of HGF secretion by ASCs was observed. Addition of a neutralizing anti-HGF antibody reversed the anti-fibrotic effect of ASCs whereas hypertrophic markers were not modulated. In summary, ASCs are an interesting source of stem cells for efficiently reducing hypertrophy and dedifferentiation of chondrocytes, at least partly via the secretion of HGF. This supports the interest of using these cells in therapies for osteo-articular diseases.",

Despite their biological importance, the regulatory networks whereby PGCs arise, migrate, and differentiate into gametes during embryonic development remains elusive, largely due to the limited number of germ cells in the early embryo. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that govern early germ cell development, we utilized an in vitro differentiation model of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and screened a series of candidate genes with specific expression in the adult reproductive organs. We discovered that gain of function of Gasz, a gene previously reported to participate in meiosis of postnatal spermatocytes, led to the most robust upregulation of PGC formation from both human and murine ESCs. In contrast, Gasz deficiency resulted in pronounced reduction of germ cells during ESC differentiation and decreased expression of MVH and DAZL in genital ridges during early embryonic development. Further analyses demonstrated that GASZ interacted with DAZL, a key germ cell regulator, to synergistically promote germ cell derivation from ESCs. Thus, our data reveal a potential role of GASZ during embryonic germ cell development and provide a powerful in vitro system for dissecting the molecular pathways in early germ cell formation during embryogenesis.",

     "abstract": "Derivation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells is mainly an epigenetic reprogramming process. It is still quite controversial how genomic imprinting is reprogrammed in iPS cells. Thus, we derived multiple iPS clones from genetically identical mouse somatic cells. We found that parentally inherited imprint was variably lost among these iPS clones. Concurrent with the loss of DNA methylation imprint at the corresponding Snrpn and Peg3 imprinted regions, parental origin-specific expression of the Snrpn and Zim1 imprinted genes was also lost in these iPS clones. This loss of parental genomic imprinting in iPS cells was likely caused by the reprogramming process during iPS cell derivation because extended culture of iPS cells did not lead to significant increase in the loss of genomic imprinting. Intriguingly, one to several paternal chromosomes appeared to have acquired de novo methylation at the Snrpn and Zac1 imprinted regions in a high percentage of iPS clones. These results might have some implications for future therapeutic applications of iPS cells. Since DNA methylation imprint can be completely erased in some iPS clones at multiple imprinted regions, iPS cell reprogramming may also be employed to dissect the underlying mechanisms of erasure, reacquisition and maintenance of genomic imprinting in mammals.",

Recent studies have shown that the precursor of nerve growth factor (NGF), proNGF, abounds in the central nervous system (CNS) and that its expression level in the brain is substantially elevated with aging as well as in several types of CNS disorders. In this study, we found for the first time that proNGF inhibited the proliferation of NSCs isolated from postnatal mouse hippocampus and caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase without affecting apoptosis. In addition, proNGF reduced the differentiation of NSCs to oligodendrocytes. The effects of proNGF were blocked by the fusion protein of p75 neurotrophin receptor extracellular domain and human IgG Fc fragment (p75NTR/Fc), and by p75NTR knockout, suggesting that proNGF/p75NTR interaction was involved in the effects of proNGF on NSC proliferation and differentiation. proNGF decreased the phosphorylation level of extracellular signal responsive kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) in a p75NTR-dependent manner under both self-renewal and differentiation conditions. The inhibition of ERK 1/2 phosphorylation by U0126 significantly reduced the proliferation and oligodendrogenesis of NSCs, indicating that ERK 1/2 inhibition by proNGF partially explains its effects on NSC proliferation and oligodendrogenesis. These results suggest that the proNGF/p75NTR signal plays a key role in the regulation of NSCs' behavior.",

     "abstract": "Adipocyte stem cells (hASCs) can proliferate and self-renew and, due to their multipotent nature, they can differentiate into several tissue-specific lineages, making them ideal candidates for use in cell therapy. Most attempts to determine the mRNA profile of self-renewing or differentiating stem cells have made use of total RNA for gene expression analysis. Several lines of evidence suggest that self-renewal and differentiation are also dependent on the control of protein synthesis by posttranscriptional mechanisms. We used adipogenic differentiation as a model, to investigate the extent to which posttranscriptional regulation controlled gene expression in hASCs. We focused on the initial steps of differentiation and isolated both the total mRNA fraction and the subpopulation of mRNAs associated with translating ribosomes. We observed that adipogenesis is committed in the first days of induction and three days appears as the minimum time of induction necessary for efficient differentiation. RNA-seq analysis showed that a significant percentage of regulated mRNAs were posttranscriptionally controlled. Part of this regulation involves massive changes in transcript untranslated regions (UTR) length, with differential extension/reduction of the 3\u2032UTR after induction. A slight correlation can be observed between the expression levels of differentially expressed genes and the 3\u2032UTR length. When we considered association to polysomes, this correlation values increased. Changes in the half lives were related to the extension of the 3\u2032UTR, with longer UTRs mainly stabilizing the transcripts. Thus, changes in the length of these extensions may be associated with changes in the ability to associate with polysomes or in half-life.",

CXCL12 is one of the chemokines secreted at an injury site and is known to attract NSC-derived neuroblasts, cells that express CXCL12 receptor, CXCR4. Activation of CXCR4 by CXCL12 depends on two domains located at the N-terminal of the chemokine. In the present work we aimed to investigate if the N-terminal end of CXCL12, where CXCR4 binding and activation domains are located, was sufficient to induce NSC-derived neuroblast chemotaxis. Our data show that a synthetic peptide analogous to the first 21 amino acids of the N-terminal end of CXCL12, named PepC-C (KPVSLSYRCPCRFFESHIARA), is able to promote chemotaxis of neuroblasts in vivo, and stimulate chemotaxis and proliferation of CXCR4\u00a0+ cells in vitro, without affecting NSC fate. We also show that PepC-C upregulates CXCL12 expression in vivo and in vitro. We suggest the N-terminal end of CXCL12 is responsible for a positive feedback loop to maintain a gradient of CXCL12 that attracts neuroblasts from the subventricular zone into an injury site.",

Here, we investigate O-GlcNAc's role in the maintenance and differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC). We reveal that protein expression of O-GlcNAc transferase and hydrolase both decreases during hPSC differentiation. Upregulating O-GlcNAc with O-GlcNAc hydrolase inhibitors has no significant effect on either the maintenance of pluripotency in hPSC culture, or the loss of pluripotency in differentiating hPSC. However, in spontaneously differentiating hPSC, excess O-GlcNAc alters the expression of specific lineage markers: decrease of ectoderm markers (PAX6 by 53\u201388%, MSX1 by 26\u201349%) and increase of adipose-related mesoderm markers (PPAR\u03b3 by 28\u2013100%, C/EBP\u03b1 by 46\u2013135%). All other lineage markers tested (cardiac, visceral-endoderm, trophectoderm) remain minimally affected by upregulated O-GlcNAc.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that excess O-GlcNAc does not affect hPSC pluripotency in undifferentiated maintenance cultures; instead, it restricts the hPSC differentiation towards specific cell lineages.

The mechanism dissection studies revealed that AR deficiency suppressed osteogenesis-related genes to inhibit osteoblast differentiation from BMSCs. Knockout of AR promoted adipogenesis of BMSCs via Akt activation through IGFBP3-mediated IGF signaling, and the 5\u2032 promoter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays further proved that AR could modulate IGFBP3 expression at the transcriptional level. Finally, addition of IGF inhibitors successfully masked the AR deficiency-induced Akt activation, and inhibitions of Akt, IGF1, and IGF2 pathways reversed the AR depletion effects on the adipogenesis process.

In fact, they are among the most promising types of stem-like cells for therapeutic applications and are the subject of intense research. However, the clinical use of hBMSCs has been confounded by limitations in their availability; they are scarce cells cumbersome to isolate and purify. Additionally, they are difficult to target to the site of injury in regeneration experiments. In order to combat these limitations, focused extracorporeal shock waves (fESW, 0.2/0.3\u00a0mJ\u00a0\u2217\u00a0mm\u2212\u00a02) were applied to purified, cultured hBMSCs. fESW (0.2\u00a0mJ\u00a0\u2217\u00a0mm\u2212\u00a02) stimulations were found to increase hBMSCs' growth rate (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), proliferation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), migration, cell tracking and wound healing (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, respectively), as well as to reduce the rate of apoptosis activation (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The increase in hBMSC migration behavior was found to be mediated by active remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton as indicated by increased directed stress fiber formations (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, hBMSCs maintain their differentiation potentials after fESW treatment, whereas 0.2\u00a0mJ\u00a0\u2217\u00a0mm\u2212\u00a02 is the most effective application. In conclusion, our results establish first-timely that hBMSCs' behavior can be modified and optimized in response to defined mechanical stimulation. These findings appear particularly promising as they suggest that mechanical stress preconditions hBMSCs for improved therapeutic performance without genetic manipulations and that mechanically preconditioned hBMSCs will be advantageous for hBMSC-based tissue regeneration. Therefore, this approach opens the door for exploiting the full potential of these cells in regenerative medicine.",

Here, we wished to improve insights into liposarcoma cellular hierarchy. Tumor section analysis indicated that the populations, distinguishable based on the expression of CD34 (a marker of adipocyte progenitors) and CD36 (a marker of adipocyte differentiation), occupy distinct intra-tumoral locations in both WDLS and DDLS. Taking advantage of these markers, we separated cells from a panel of fresh human surgical specimens by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Based on chromosome analysis and the culture phenotypes of the composing populations, we demonstrate that malignant cells comprise four mesenchymal populations distinguished by the expression of CD34 and CD36, while vascular (CD31\u00a0+) and hematopoietic (CD45\u00a0+) components are non-neoplastic. Finally, we show that mouse xenografts are derivable from both CD36-negative and CD36-positive DDLS cells, and that each population recreates the heterogeneity of CD36 expression in vivo. Combined, our results show that malignant cells in WDLS and DDLS can be classified according to distinct stages of adipogenesis and indicate immunophenotypic plasticity of malignant liposarcoma cells.",

However, the scientific significance of the teratoma assay has been debated due to the fact that transplanted cells are exposed to a non-physiological environment. Since many mice are used for a result that is heavily questioned, it is time to reconsider the teratoma assay from an ethical point of view. Candidate alternatives to the teratoma assay comprise the directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells into organotypic cells, differentiation of cells in embryoid bodies, the analysis of pluripotency-associated biomarkers with high correlation to the teratoma forming potential of stem cells, predictive epigenetic footprints, or a combination of these technologies. Each of these assays is capable of addressing one or more aspects of pluripotency, however it is essential that these assays are validated to provide an accepted robust, reproducible alternative.

Furthermore, expression of GBC-specific genes was repressed, including Sox17 and Hes1. Reprogramming was also enhanced by addition of retinoic acid and inhibition of Notch signaling. Importantly, rGBCs were able to engraft long term in vivo and remained insulin-positive for 15\u00a0weeks. We conclude that GBCs are a viable source for autologous cell replacement in diabetes, but that complete reprogramming will require further manipulations.",

Until now, their isolation has not been reported, which has hampered studies of their regulatory mechanisms. We sorted by FACS quiescent NSCs and their progeny from the subventricular zone (SVZ) of adult mice according to the expression of the NSC marker LeX/CD15, the EGF receptor (EGFR) and the CD24 in combination with the vital DNA marker Hoechst 33342. Characterization of sorted cells showed that the LeXbright/EGFR-negative population was enriched in quiescent cells having an NSC phenotype. In contrast to proliferating NSCs and progenitors, the LeXbright/EGFR-negative cells, i.e. quiescent NSCs, resisted to a moderate dose of gamma-radiation (4\u00a0Gy), entered the cell cycle two days after irradiation prior to EGFR acquisition and ultimately repopulated the SVZ. We further show that the GABAAR signaling regulates their cell cycle entry by using specific GABAAR agonists/antagonists and that the radiation-induced depletion of neuroblasts, the major GABA source, provoked their proliferation in the irradiated SVZ. Our study demonstrates that quiescent NSCs are specifically enriched in the LeXbright/EGFR-negative population, and identifies the GABAAR signaling as a regulator of the SVZ niche size by modulating the quiescence of NSCs.",

However, it is still unknown whether human iPSC-derived motoneurons can functionally innervate target muscles in vivo, which is the definitive sign of successful cell therapy for motoneuron diseases. In the present study, we demonstrated that human iPSCs derived from mesenchymal cells of the umbilical cord possessed a high yield in neural differentiation. Using a chemically-defined in vitro system, human iPSCs efficiently differentiated into motoneurons which displayed typical morphology, expressed specific molecules, and generated repetitive trains of action potentials. When transplanted into the injured musculocutaneous nerve of rats, they survived robustly, extended axons along the nerve, and formed functional connections with the target muscle (biceps brachii), thereby protecting the muscle from atrophy. Our study provides evidence for the first time that human iPSC-derived motoneurons are truly functional not only in vitro but also in vivo, and they have potential for stem cell-based therapies for motoneuron diseases.",

Finally, when AFSCs were co-implanted with human-bone forming cells, a normo-osteosynthesis occurred, the engineered ossicle was hyper-vascularized, but AFSCs were not retrieved in the implant within 2\u00a0weeks. We concluded that AFSCs do not contribute to the deposition of new bone, but act as a powerful proinflammatory/proangiogenic boost, driving a host response, ending in AFSC clearance and vascularization of the bone environment.In our model, a source of osteocommitted cells, capable to engraft and proliferate in vivo, is needed in order to engineer bone. The angio-attractant properties of AFSCs could be exploited in strategies of endogenous cell homing to actively recruit host progenitors into a predefined anatomic location for in situ bone tissue regeneration.",

Human neural progenitors derived from pluripotent embryonic stem cells and propagated in adherent serum-free cultures provide a fate restricted renewable source for quick production of neural cells; however, such cells are highly refractive to astrocytogenesis and show a strong neurogenic bias, similar to neural progenitors from the early embryonic central nervous system (CNS). We found that several astrocytic genes are hypermethylated in such progenitors potentially preventing generation of astrocytes and leading to the proneuronal fate of these progenitors. However, epigenetic modification by Azacytidine (Aza-C) and Trichostatin A (TSA), with concomitant signaling from BMP2 and LIF in neural progenitor cultures shifts this bias, leading to expression of astrocytic markers as early as 5\u00a0days of differentiation, with near complete suppression of neuronal differentiation. The resultant cells express major astrocytic markers, are amenable to co-culture with neurons, can be propagated as astrocyte progenitors and are cryopreservable. Although previous reports have generated astrocytes from pluripotent cells, the differentiation required extensive culture or selection based on cell surface antigens. The development of a label free and rapid differentiation process will expedite future derivation of astrocytes from various sources pluripotent cells including, but not limited to, human astrocytes associated with various neurological diseases.",

We used hESC to obtain radial glial cells (hESC-RG) and then compared them with RG cells isolated from human fetal forebrain. Fate of hESC-RG cells critically depends on intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The expression of Pax6 (intrinsic factor) has a similar neurogenic effect on hESC-RG differentiation as reported for human fetal RG cells. Factors from the microenvironment also play a significant role in determining hESC-RG cell fate. In contrast to control cultures, wherein hESC-RG generate mainly astroglia and far fewer neurons, in co-cultures with human fetal forebrain cells, the reverse was found to be true. This neurogenic effect was partly due to soluble factors from human fetal brain cultures. The detected shift towards neurogenesis has significance for developing future efficient neuro-differentiation protocols. Importantly, we established that hESC-RG cells are similar in many respects to human fetal RG cells, including their proliferative capacity, neurogenic potential, and ability to generate various cortical neuronal sub-types. Unlike fetal RG cells, the hESC-RG cells are readily available and can be standardized, features that have considerable practical advantages in research and clinics.",

     "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Glioma stem cells (GSCs) are relatively resistant to chemo-radiotherapy and are responsible for tumor progression and the recurrence of glioblastomas after conventional therapy. Thus, the control of the GSC population is considered key to realizing long-term survival of glioblastoma patients. Here, we identified that resveratrol significantly reduced the self-renewal and tumor-initiating capacity of patient-derived GSCs. Furthermore, resveratrol promoted Nanog suppression via proteasomal degradation, which was inhibited by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. p53 activation is an important factor in Nanog suppression and treatment with resveratrol was also found to activate the p53/p21 pathway. Importantly, inhibition of Nanog by siRNA provoked inhibitory effects on both the self-renewal and tumor-forming capacity of GSCs. Our findings indicate that Nanog is an essential factor for the retention of stemness and may contribute to the resveratrol-induced differentiation of GSCs. Our results also suggest that targeting GSCs via the p53\u2013Nanog axis, with resveratrol for instance, could be a therapeutic strategy against glioblastoma.",

     "abstract": "In this study, mesenchymal stem cells deriving from dental pulp (DPSCs) of normal human impacted third molars, previously characterized for their ability to differentiate into osteoblasts, were used. We observed that: i) DPSCs, undifferentiated or submitted to osteogenic differentiation, express all four subtypes of adenosine receptors (AR) and CD73, corresponding to 5\u2032-ecto-nucleotidase; and ii) AR stimulation with selective agonists elicited a greater osteogenic cell differentiation consequent to A1 receptor (A1R) activation. Therefore, we focused on the activity of this AR. The addition of 15\u201360\u00a0nM 2-chloro-N6-cyclopentyl-adenosine (CCPA), A1R agonist, to DPSCs at each change of the culture medium significantly increased the proliferation of cells grown in osteogenic medium after 8\u00a0days in vitro (DIV) without modifying that of undifferentiated DPSCs. Better characterizing the effect of A1R stimulation on the osteogenic differentiation capability of these cells, we found that CCPA increased the: i) expression of two well known and early osteogenic markers, RUNX-2 and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), after 3 and 7\u00a0DIV; ii) ALP enzyme activity at 7\u00a0DIV and iii) mineralization of extracellular matrix after 21\u00a0DIV. These effects, abolished by cell pre-treatment with the A1R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropyl-xanthine (DPCPX), involved the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling as, in differentiating DPSCs, CCPA significantly increased dishevelled protein and inhibited glycogen synthase kinase-3\u03b2, both molecules being downstream of Wnt receptor signal pathway. Either siRNA of dishevelled or cell pre-treatment with Dickkopf-1, known inhibitor of Wnt signaling substantially reduced either DPSC osteogenic differentiation or its enhancement promoted by CCPA. Summarizing, our findings indicate that the stimulation of A1R may stimulate DPSC duplication enhancing their osteogenic differentiation efficiency. These effects may have clinical implications possibly facilitating bone tissue repair and remodeling.",

Clonal USSC compared to CDSC and BMSC lines differ in their developmental origin reflected by a distinct HOX expression.

Herein co-culture experiments were performed, presenting a novel approach to modulate the differentiation potency of USSCs towards HOX positive stromal cells. After co-culturing native USSCs with CDSCs and BMSCs, USSCs adapt a positive HOX code and gain the adipogenic differentiation capacity.

Our recent study shows that hypoxia increased miR-210 expression in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) in a time-dependent manner. However, the role of miR-210 in NPCs remains unknown. Following the identification of the miR-210 putative target genes, we demonstrated that the Bcl-2 adenovirus E1B 19\u00a0kDa-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), which is regulated by HIF-1 and activates cell death, is regulated by miR-210 in NPCs under hypoxia. Moreover, the over-expression of miR-210 decreased apoptosis in NPCs, and the inhibition of miR-210 expression remarkably increased the number of TUNEL-positive NPCs by 30% in response to hypoxia. Importantly, miR-210 mimics reduced both BNIP3 protein expression and the translocation of AIF into the nucleus, which reduced cell death, whereas miR-210 inhibitors reversed this process, leading to cell death during hypoxia. Taken together, we report a novel feedback loop of BNIP3 regulation in NPCs under hypoxia. HIF-1 is activated under hypoxia and then induces the expression of both BNIP3 and miR-210. The upregulation of miR-210 then directly suppresses BNIP3 expression to maintain the survival of NPCs under hypoxia. This negative feedback regulation might partially contribute to protection against hypoxia-induced cell death via the inhibition of AIF nuclear translocation.",

Abnormal interneuron function is implicated in the pathobiology of neurological disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and epilepsy. Studies on interneuron development and their role in disease would benefit from an efficient mechanism for the production and selection of specific interneuron subgroups. In this study, we engineered a mouse embryonic stem cell (mESC) line for doxycycline-inducible expression of Nkx2.1, a required transcription factor for cortical interneurons derived from the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE). This mESC line was modified to express GFP in Lhx6+ cells, a marker of newly postmitotic and mature MGE-derived cortical interneurons. The addition of doxycycline to differentiating ESCs efficiently induced Nkx2.1 protein and increased the production of GFP+ cells. Transplantation of GFP+ putative interneuron precursors resulted in migratory, morphological, and neurochemical features consistent with cortical interneuron fates. To test the hypothesis that Sonic hedgehog (Shh) primarily influences cortical interneuron fate determination through the induction of Nkx2.1, ESCs were grown with doxycycline and the Shh antagonist cyclopamine. We found induced Nkx2.1 renders Shh signaling dispensable for the generation of MGE-derived interneurons.

Our previous findings indicate that BMP4 (bone morphogenetic protein 4) induces nearly complete commitment of C3H10T1/2 pluripotent stem cells to the adipocyte lineage and knockdown of lysyl oxidase (Lox) disrupts this commitment process. Here, we found that an epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like response is required for adipocyte lineage commitment and that Lox is indispensable for this process. When C3H10T1/2 cells were treated with BMP4, Vim and Cdh2 showed up-regulated expression while Cdh1 and Ocln were down-regulated along with enhanced cell migration, which are EMT-like responses. Silencing of Lox in BMP4-treated C3H10T1/2 cells induced a mesenchymal\u2013epithelial transition (MET)-like response associated with the repression of mesenchymal markers, induction of epithelial markers and decreased cell migration. Importantly, blocking the EMT-like response by knocking down Cdh2 or over-expression of Cdh1 impairs adipocyte lineage commitment. EMT is regulated by distinct transcription factors such as Snai1, Snai2 and Twist. In this study, we also found that only Twist was down-regulated after Lox silencing in C3H10T1/2 cells treated with BMP4. This study provides new insights into adipocyte lineage commitment.",

This study aims to investigate the therapeutic potential of human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ECs (hiPSC-ECs) to treat SSc. We have assessed the functional differentiation of hiPSC-ECs and compared them with human embryonic stem cell-derived ECs (hESC-ECs) by a variety of in vitro experimental approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of hiPSC-ECs in a bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model. Our results demonstrated that hiPSC-ECs and hESC-ECs showed similar maximum expressions of FLK1 (early EC marker) at day five during differentiation. After sorting and culturing, the FLK1-positive cells exhibited spindle and subsequent endothelial cobblestone morphology in EGM2 medium. The hESC-ECs and hiPSC-ECs also expressed late EC markers CD31 (68% and 75%), CD144 (50% and 61%), CD146 (46% and 61%), and DiI-labeled acetylated low-density lipoprotein (DiI-ac-LDL) uptake (55% and 63%), respectively. They additionally formed capillary-like structures on Matrigel. Analyses of the transplantation of sorted CD31-positive hiPSC-ECs into the bleomycin-induced SSc mouse model demonstrated that these cells participate in recovery of the damaged vessels. There was a reduction in collagen content; the number of total and degranulated mast cells returned to their normal state, and bleomycin-induced wounds as well as skin fibrosis improved four weeks after transplantation of hiPSC-ECs. Our findings have shown that the differentiation process from hESCs and hiPSCs to vascular cell components is similar. Additionally, this is the first study to determine the therapeutic potential of vascular cells from hiPSCs in the treatment of an SSc model. In the future, with further validation, these may be used as an appropriate source for the treatment of SSc patients.",

Recently, we found that the key features of reperfusion injury, namely loss of ATP/NADH, increased oxidative stress and cell death were underpinned by proteomic deficiencies in ischemic/reperfused myocardium, and could be ameliorated by proteins in exosomes. To test this hypothesis in vivo, mice (C57Bl6/J) underwent 30\u00a0min ischemia, followed by reperfusion (I/R injury). Purified exosomes or saline was administered 5\u00a0min before reperfusion. Exosomes reduced infarct size by 45% compared to saline treatment. Langendorff experiments revealed that intact but not lysed exosomes enhanced viability of the ischemic/reperfused myocardium. Exosome treated animals exhibited significant preservation of left ventricular geometry and contractile performance during 28\u00a0days follow-up. Within an hour after reperfusion, exosome treatment increased levels of ATP and NADH, decreased oxidative stress, increased phosphorylated-Akt and phosphorylated-GSK-3\u03b2, and reduced phosphorylated-c-JNK in ischemic/reperfused hearts. Subsequently, both local and systemic inflammation were significantly reduced 24\u00a0h after reperfusion. In conclusion, our study shows that intact exosomes restore bioenergetics, reduce oxidative stress and activate pro-survival signaling, thereby enhancing cardiac function and geometry after myocardial I/R injury. Hence, mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes are a potential adjuvant to reperfusion therapy for myocardial infarction.",

In this study, we revealed that miR-17-5p and miR-106a have dual functions in the modulation of human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hADSCs) commitment by gain- and loss-of-function assays. They could promote adipogenesis and inhibit osteogenesis. Luciferase reporter assay, western blot and ELISA suggested BMP2 was a direct target of miR-17-5p and miR-106a. Downregulation of endogeneous BMP2 by RNA interference suppressed osteogenesis and increased adipogenesis, similar to the effect of miR-17-5p and miR-106a upregulation. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of miR-17-5p on osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation of hADSCs could be reversed by BMP2 RNA interference. In conclusion, miR-17-5p and miR-106a regulate osteogenic and adipogenic lineage commitment of hADSCs by directly targeting BMP2, and subsequently decreased osteogenic TAZ, MSX2 and Runx2, and increased adipogenic C/EBP\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3.",

The expression patterns of human leukocyte antigen, co-stimulatory and adhesion molecules in hESC-NPCs and hfNPCs were relatively similar and mostly not affected by inflammatory cytokines. Unstimulated hfNPCs secreted more transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and \u03b22 but similar level of interleukin (IL)-10 compared to hESC-NPCs. In contrast to hfNPCs, hESC-NPCs displayed 4\u20136 fold increases in TGF-\u03b21, TGF-\u03b22 and IL-10 under inflammatory conditions. Both hNPCs reduced the alloreaction between allogeneic peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and up-regulated CD4+CD25+forkhead box P3 (FOXP3)+ T cells. However, hESC-NPCs but not hfNPCs dose-dependently triggered PBMC proliferation, which at least partly may be due to TGF-\u03b2 signaling.

In this study, we showed that mouse iPSCs failed to efficiently give rise to neuronal cells using conventional methods previously established for driving mouse ESC differentiation. We reported a novel approach which remarkably increases neural differentiation of mouse iPSCs. This novel approach initiated embryoid body (EB) formation directly from the whole cell clones isolated from the top of feeder cells. Compared to conventional neural induction methods such as single cell suspension or monolayer culture, the cell clone-derived EB method led to a pronounced increase in directed generation of various types of neural cells including neural stem cells, motoneurons and dopaminergic neurons in response to different inducers. Through gene expression microarray analysis, we identified 14 genes that were highly expressed in the cell clone-derived EBs. Among them, we found that Cdh2, also known as N-cadherin, played important roles in controlling the neural differentiation efficiency of mouse iPSCs. Forced expression of Cdh2 in iPSCs substantially enhanced the differentiation efficiency while knocking-down of Cdh2 by shRNA blocked the neural differentiation. Our results revealed a critical role of Cdh2 in the process of efficient neural differentiation of mouse iPS cells.",

Limbal epithelial cells were isolated from corneoscleral disks, and cultured using either feeder cells in a growth medium supplemented with serum (3T3 system) or without feeder cells in a dedicated serum-free medium (EpiLife). During the culture, the cells were maintained either at ambient oxygen tension (20%) or at different levels of hypoxia (15, 10, 5, and 2% oxygen). The effect of oxygen on cell growth, progression through cell cycle, colony forming efficiency (CFE), and expression of stem cell (ABCG2 and p63\u03b1) and differentiation (CK3) markers was determined throughout the culture period of up to 18\u00a0days. Low oxygen levels favored a stem cell phenotype with a lower proliferative rate, high CFE, and a relatively higher expression of ABCG2 and p63\u03b1, while higher levels of oxygen led not only to decreased CFE but also to increased proportion of differentiated cells positive for CK3. Hypoxic cultures may thus potentially improve stem cell grafts for cultured limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET).",

Many highly mutated sites among family members were hypervariable sites in the mtDNA control region. Further, CD34+ cells from members of the same family also shared several unique mtDNA variants, suggesting pedigree-specific occurrence of these variants. Overall age-related accumulation of mtDNA mutations in CD34+ cells varied in different families, suggesting a specific accumulation pattern, which might be modulated by family genetic background.

Therefore, we examined the effect of fibronectin on GLUT-1 expression, trafficking, and its related signal pathways in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Fibronectin increased 2-deoxyglucose (DG) uptake and GLUT-1 protein expression that were blocked by transcription or translation inhibitors. Integrin \u03b15\u03b21-bound fibronectin increased 2-DG uptake through cluster formation with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2, and then activated Ras and PI3K/Akt. In another pathway, integrin \u03b15\u03b21 displayed structural and functional interactions with calcium channels, and stimulated 2-DG uptake through calcium influx and PKC activation. Akt and PKC-induced PPAR\u03b3 phosphorylation enhanced the decreased expression of PPAR\u03b3 protein, and subsequently increased GLUT-1 protein synthesis and 2-DG uptake. Fibronectin stimulated TC10 activity and cytoskeleton (F-actin) rearrangement, followed by GLUT-1 trafficking. In conclusion, integrin-bound fibronectin stimulates GLUT-1 synthesis through VEGFR2/Ras/PI3K/Akt and calcium channel/Ca2\u00a0+/PKC, which are merged at PPAR\u03b3 and GLUT-1 trafficking through TC10 and F-actin.",

In the present study, our objective was to investigate the involvement of macrophages in the therapeutic effect of human umbilical cord-derived stromal cells (hUCSCs) on renal IRI. Twenty-four hours after reperfusion, hUCSCs were injected intravenously and resulted in significant improvements in renal function, with a lower tubular injury score together with more proliferative and fewer apoptotic tubular cells in kidney tissue. Moreover, hUCSCs reduced the infiltration of macrophages into renal interstitium especially at 5\u00a0days post-reperfusion, while the proportion of anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages was markedly increased. HUCSCs also alleviated the local inflammatory response in kidneys. The absence of macrophages during the early phase of reperfusion enhanced the therapeutic effect of hUCSCs, whereas macrophage depletion during the late repair phase eliminated the renoprotective role of hUCSCs. In vitro, macrophages cocultured with hUCSCs were switched to the alternatively activated M2 phenotype. Our data indicate that hUCSCs are capable of promoting the M2 polarization of macrophages at injury sites, suggesting a new mechanism for hUCSC-mediated protection in renal IRI.",

While cell death was both caspase- and necroptosis-independent, it was partially dependent on the activity of lysosomal proteases. A role for autophagy in the cell death process was eliminated, suggesting that ETO induces a novel PCD pathway in mESCs. Inhibition of p53 either as a transcription factor by pifithrin \u03b1 or in its mitochondrial role by pifithrin \u03bc significantly reduced ESC death levels. Finally, EndoG was newly identified as a protease participating in the DNA fragmentation observed during ETO-induced PCD.

Unfortunately, culture conditions have not been as effective as in vivo growth conditions, where bone marrow macrophages are known to be a key regulator of erythropoiesis. This study focused on the fact that some erythroblasts are detached from macrophages and only contact other erythroblasts. We hypothesized that additional factors regulate erythroblasts, likely through either physical contact or secreted factors. To further elucidate these critical factors, human erythroblasts derived from cord blood were cultured at high density to mimic marrow conditions. This growth condition resulted in a significantly increased erythroid enucleation rate and viability. We found several novel contact-related signals in erythroblasts: intercellular adhesion molecule-4 (ICAM-4) and deleted in liver cancer-1 (DLC-1). DLC-1, a Rho-GTPase-activating protein, has not previously been reported in erythroid cells, but its interaction with ICAM-4 was demonstrated here. We further confirmed the presence of a secreted form of human ICAM-4 for the first time. When soluble ICAM-4 was added to media, cell viability and enucleation increased with decreased nuclear dysplasia, suggesting that ICAM-4 is a key factor in contact between cells. These results highlight potential new mechanisms for autonomous control of erythropoiesis. The application of these procedures to erythrocyte manufacturing could enhance in vitro erythrocyte production for clinical use.",

However, how modulation of Nodal/Activin signaling influences developmental competence and commitment toward specific lineages is still unclear. Here, we showed that enhancement of Nodal/Activin signaling for 4\u00a0days was necessary and sufficient to upregulate DE markers, while it diminished the upregulation of NE markers by inhibition of Nodal/Activin signaling. This suggests that after 4\u00a0days of enhanced Nodal/Activin signaling, hESCs are committed to the DE lineage and have lost competence toward the NE lineage. In contrast, inhibition of Nodal/Activin signaling using LY364947 for 2\u00a0days was sufficient to impair competence toward the DE lineage, although cells were still able to activate LEFTY1 and NODAL, direct targets of Nodal/Activin signaling. Expression analyses indicated that the levels of pluripotency regulators NANOG and POU5F1 were significantly diminished by 2\u00a0days of LY364947 treatment, although the expression of NANOG, but not POU5F1, was restored immediately upon Activin A treatment.

     "abstract": "We have developed a simple method to generate and expand multipotent, self-renewing pre-rosette neural stem cells from both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) without utilizing embryoid body formation, manual selection techniques, or complex combinations of small molecules. Human ESC and iPSC colonies were lifted and placed in a neural stem cell medium containing high concentrations of EGF and FGF-2. Cell aggregates (termed EZ spheres) could be expanded for long periods using a chopping method that maintained cell\u2013cell contact. Early passage EZ spheres rapidly down-regulated OCT4 and up-regulated SOX2 and nestin expression. They retained the potential to form neural rosettes and consistently differentiated into a range of central and peripheral neural lineages. Thus, they represent a very early neural stem cell with greater differentiation flexibility than other previously described methods. As such, they will be useful for the rapidly expanding field of neurological development and disease modeling, high-content screening, and regenerative therapies based on pluripotent stem cell technology.",

Furthermore, electron microscope revealed stromal cells penetrating the epithelial basal membrane and forming calcium-dependent cellular adhesions with N-cad+ limbal basal epithelial cells.Although we could not clearly detect the expression of N-cad in the AQP1+ cells, AQP1+ cells immediately beneath the epithelial basement membrane may be stromal niche-like cells that directly interact with N-cad+ limbal basal epithelial progenitor cells.",

Inflammatory signals are partially mediated by chemokines acting via their receptors expressed on the target cells. Data concerning the repertoire and biological activities of chemokine receptors in human adipose tissue derived stromal cells (ADSCs) are limited. Here we show that CCR1 is one of the few chemokine receptors expressed in ADSCs at a high level. CCR1 expression varies in ADSCs derived from different donors. It sharply decreases in the early phase of ADSCs in vitro propagation, but further demonstrates relative stability. Expression of CCR1 positively correlates with expression of SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG, transcription factors responsible for maintenance of the stemness properties of the cells. We demonstrate that signaling via CCL5/CCR1 axis triggers migration of ADSCs, activates ERK and AKT kinases, stimulates NF\u03baB transcriptional activity and culminates in increased proliferation of CCR1+ cells accompanied with up-regulation of SOX2, OCT4 and NANOG expression. Our data suggest that chemokine signaling via CCR1 may be involved in regulation of stemness of ADSCs.",

There is some controversy regarding whether small intestine (SI) Paneth cells (PCs) play a central role in orchestrating crypt architecture and their relationship with Lgr5\u00a0+\u00a0ve stem cells. Nevertheless, we previously showed that germline CSF-1 receptor (Csf1r) knock out (KO) or Csf1 mutation is associated with an absence of mature PC, reduced crypt proliferation and lowered stem cell gene, Lgr5 expression. Here we show the additional loss of CD24, Bmi1 and Olfm4 expression in the KO crypts and a high resolution 3D localization of CSF-1R mainly to PC. The induction of GI-specific Csf1r deletion in young adult mice also led to PC loss over a period of weeks, in accord with the anticipated long life span of PC, changed distribution of proliferating cells and this was with a commensurate loss of Lgr5 and other stem cell marker gene expression. By culturing SI organoids, we further show that the Csf1r\u2212/\u2212 defect in PC production is intrinsic to epithelial cells as well as definitively affecting stem cell activity. These results show that CSF-1R directly supports PC maturation and that in turn PCs fashion the intestinal stem cell niche.",

Understanding the cellular mechanisms and pathways involved in extraembryonic (ExE) differentiation is of great interest because of the important role of this process in maternal health and fertility. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) is widely used to maintain the self-renewal of hESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells, while all trans retinoic acid (RA) is used to facilitate the directed differentiation of hESCs. Here, we monitored the RA induced differentiation of hESCs to the ExE lineage with and without FGF-2 over a 7-day period via global transcriptional profiling. The stemness markers POU5F1, NANOG and TDGF1 were markedly downregulated, whereas an upregulation of the ExE markers KRT7, CGA, DDAH2 and IGFBP3 was observed. Many of the differentially expressed genes were involved in WNT and TGF-\u03b2 signaling. RA inactivated WNT signaling even in the presence of exogenous FGF-2, which that promotes the maintenance of the pluripotent state. We also show that BMP4 was upregulated and that RA was able to modulate the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway and direct hESCs toward the ExE lineage. In addition, an epigenetic study revealed hypermethylation of the DDAH2, TDGF1 and GATA3 gene promoters, suggesting a role for epigenetic regulation during ExE differentiation. These data reveals that the effect of RA prevails in the presence of exogenous FGF-2 thus resulting in the direction of hESCs toward the ExE lineage.",

Adult rats were subjected to bilateral common carotid ligation (BCCL) and after 1\u00a0day 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0107 BMMCs or saline injection. The BMMC transplant stimulated a transitory increase in the proliferation of SVZ cells in the BCCL group. We observed a significant increase in the number of RGLCs 3\u00a0days after ischemia, in both BCCL and BCCL\u00a0+\u00a0BMMC groups. However, this increase persisted in the subsequent days only in BCCL animals that received the transplant. BMMC transplantation also inhibits the reduction of NG2-positive oligodendrocyte progenitors in the SVZ observed in the BCCL group. Interestingly, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was up-regulated in the SVZ in the treated animals, but not in the other groups. These data thus suggest that BMMC transplantation modulates the phenotype of RGLCs/progenitors in the SVZ and could have a protective role after ischemia.",

However, it remains to be investigated whether elevated FFAs would have a direct effect on neural stem cells (NSCs). Here, we reported that palmitic acid (PA) impaired cell viability and increased apoptosis of NSCs significantly in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Increased protein levels of Bax and cleaved caspase 3 coupled with decreased expression of Bcl-2 were also observed in NSCs with increasing dose or time of PA treatment, whereas caspase 3 expression remained relatively unaltered. In parallel to this, the expression of phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK) in NSCs challenged with PA was increased significantly; however, JNK expression appeared stable. Remarkably, JNK inhibitor effectively reduced the apoptosis of NSCs induced by PA. The expression of phospho-p38 (p-p38), p38, phospho-extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (p-EKR1/2) and EKR1/2 in NSCs was not affected by PA treatment. In consideration of the above, it is suggested that elevated plasma FFA level may induce apoptosis of NSCs in vivo, and that this might be one of possible underlying mechanisms for the cognitive disturbance in neurological disorders.",

Recently, it has been reported that HMGA2 is highly expressed in fetal neural stem cells and has the capacity to promote stemness. However, there is currently no information available on the functional significance and molecular mechanisms of the cellular in vitro aging and proliferation of human umbilical cord blood-derived stromal cells (hUCBSCs). In the present study, we evaluated the direct effects of HMGA2 on the cellular aging and proliferation of hUCBSCs and investigated potential regulatory mechanisms responsible for the corresponding functions. We found that the overexpression of HMGA2 enhanced proliferation and reduced or even reversed the in vitro aging process of hUCBSCs. This effect was accompanied by the increased expression of cyclin E and CDC25A and the significantly decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Furthermore, HMGA2 inhibition compromised cell proliferation and adipogenic differentiation in early-stage hUCBSCs. From the molecular/cellular functional analysis of microarray data, we found that HMGA2 overexpression induced a PI3K/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K cascade, which in turn suppressed the expression of p16INK4A and p21CIP1/WAF1 in hUCBSCs. These results provide novel insights into the mechanism by which HMGA2 regulates the in vitro aging and proliferation of hUCBSCs.",

To address this problem we developed an optimized strategy for magnetic isolation of PSA-NCAM positive neuronal precursors from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived neuronal cultures. PSA-NCAM enrichment at an early step of the in vitro differentiation process increased the number of ES cell derived neurons and reduced cellular diversity. Gene expression analysis revealed that mainly genes involved in neuronal activity were over-represented after purification. In vitro derived PSA-NCAM+ enriched precursors were characterized in vivo through grafting into the forebrain of adult mice. While unsorted control cells 40\u00a0days post graft gave rise to a mixed population composed of immature precursors, early postmitotic neurons and glial cells, PSA-NCAM+ enriched cells differentiated predominantly into NeuN positive cells. Furthermore, PSA-NCAM enriched population showed efficient migration towards the olfactory bulb after transplantation into the rostral migratory stream of the forebrain neurogenic system. Thus, enrichment of neuronal precursors based on PSA-NCAM expression represents a general and straightforward approach to narrow cellular heterogeneity during neuronal differentiation of pluripotent cells.",

For the preparation of more potent periosteal sheets, we examined the applicability of stem-cell culture media. Compared to the control medium (Medium 199\u00a0+\u00a010% FBS), periosteal sheets expanded with MesenPRO-RS\u2122 medium exhibited these features: Cells grew three-dimensionally and deposited collagen in the extracellular spaces to form thicker multilayers of cells. Chondrocytic markers were not significantly upregulated. Contractile force was generated in proportion with the increased thickness of the periosteal sheets and the formation of cytoplasmic \u03b1-smooth muscle actin fibers. However, myofibroblastic markers were not significantly upregulated. The surface marker CD146 was substantially upregulated, while both CD73 and CD105 were downregulated. Alkaline phosphatase, a representative osteoblastic marker, was not upregulated by osteogenic induction. However, these expanded periosteal sheets exhibited substantially stronger osteogenic differentiation when implanted in nude mice. Therefore, despite our reservations, MesenPRO medium effectively expanded the cells contained in periosteal sheets to promote the formation of thicker multilayers of cells in vitro, and these enhanced periosteal sheets expressed increased osteogenic potential at implantation sites in vivo. In conjunction with data indicating that CD146-positive cells were notably expanded and the recently proposed concept that CD146 is a marker for osteogenic progenitor cells found in the bone marrow stroma, our findings suggest that MesenPRO medium improves the preparation of highly osteogenic periosteal sheets suitable for clinical application largely through the induction of CD146-positive cells.",

To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the identity of the transport system that is responsible for the uptake of ascorbic acid into bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). First, we examined the expression of the two known isoforms of the sodium-coupled ascorbic acid transporter, namely SVCT1 and SVCT2, in BMSCs (Lin\u00a0\u2212\u00a0ve Sca1\u00a0+\u00a0ve) and bone at the mRNA level. Only SVCT2 mRNA was detected in BMSCs and bone. Uptake of ascorbic acid in BMSCs was Na+-dependent and saturable. In order to define the role of SVCT2 in BMSC differentiation into osteoblasts, BMSCs were stimulated with osteogenic media for different time intervals, and the activity of SVCT2 was monitored by ascorbic acid uptake. SVCT2 expression was up-regulated during the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs; the expression was maximal at the earliest phase of differentiation. Subsequently, osteogenesis was inhibited in BMSCs upon knock-down of SVCT2 by lentivirus shRNA. We also found that the expression of the SVCT2 could be negatively or positively modulated by the presence of oxidant (Sin-1) or antioxidant (Ascorbic acid) compounds, respectively, in BMSCs. Furthermore, we found that this transporter is also regulated with age in mouse bone. These data show that SVCT2 plays a vital role in the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs and that its expression is altered under conditions associated with redox reaction. Our findings could be relevant to bone tissue engineering and bone related diseases such as osteoporosis in which oxidative stress and aging plays important role.",

Of these, the Ca2\u00a0+ channel blockers caused profound shortening of action potentials, whereas the classical hERG blockers, like dofetilide and d,l-sotalol, induced prolongation, as expected.Unexpectedly, two potent blockers of the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs), HMR1556 and JNJ303, had only minor effects on the extracellular FP of wild-type hPSC-CM despite evidence of functional IKs channels. These compounds were therefore re-evaluated under conditions that mimicked reduced \u201crepolarization reserve,\u201d a parameter reflecting the capacity of cardiomyocytes to repolarize and a strong risk factor for the development of ventricular arrhythmias. Strikingly, in both pharmacological and genetic models of diminished repolarization reserve, HMR1556 and JNJ03 strongly increased the FP duration. These profound effects indicate that IKs plays an important role in limiting action potential prolongation when repolarization reserve is attenuated. The findings have important clinical implications and indicate that enhanced sensitization to repolarization-prolonging compounds through pharmacotherapy or genetic predisposition should be taken into account when assessing drug safety.",

We recently isolated Tuj1\u00a0+ cells from skeletal muscle culture of Nestin\u2013GFP transgenic mice however whether they form functional neurons in the brain is not yet known. Additionally, their isolation from nontransgenic species and identification of their ancestors is unknown. This gap of knowledge precludes us from studying their role as a valuable alternative to neural progenitors. Here, we identified two pericyte subtypes, type-1 and type-2, using a double transgenic Nestin\u2013GFP/NG2\u2013DsRed mouse and demonstrated that Nestin\u2013GFP\u00a0+/Tuj1\u00a0+ cells derive from type-2 Nestin\u2013GFP\u00a0+/NG2\u2013DsRed\u00a0+/CD146\u00a0+ pericytes located in the skeletal muscle interstitium.

Anal sphincter pressures and electromyography (EMG) were recorded after injury but before treatment and 10\u00a0days after injury.

MSCs delivered IM after SP resulted in a significant increase in resting anal sphincter pressure and anal sphincter EMG frequency but not amplitude. There was no improvement in anal sphincter pressure or EMG with in animals receiving MSCs after PNC. GFP-labelled cells were not found near the external anal sphincter in MSC-treated animals after SP.MSC treatment resulted in significant improvement in anal pressures after SP but not after PNC, suggesting that MSCs could be utilized to facilitate recovery after anal sphincter injury.",

To determine if there is a causal relationship between G1 phase restriction and pluripotency, we made use of the Fluorescence Ubiquitination Cell Cycle Indicator (FUCCI) reporter system to FACS-sort ESCs in the different cell cycle phases. Hence, the G1 phase cells appeared to be more susceptible to differentiation, particularly when ESCs self-renewed in the na\u00efve state of pluripotency. Transitions from ground to na\u00efve, then from na\u00efve to primed states of pluripotency were associated with increased durations of the G1 phase, and cyclin E-mediated alteration of the G1/S transition altered the balance between self-renewal and differentiation. LIF withdrawal resulted in a lengthening of the G1 phase in na\u00efve ESCs, which occurred prior to the appearance of early lineage-specific markers, and could be reversed upon LIF supplementation. We concluded that the short G1 phase observed in murine ESCs was a determinant of na\u00efve pluripotency and was partially under the control of LIF signaling.",

While recapitulating this developmental pathway produces glutamatergic, bipolar neurons reminiscent of SGNs, these neurons are functionally immature, being characterized by a depolarized resting potential and limited excitability. We explored the effects of two neurotrophins known to be present in the inner ear, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), on the electrophysiology of neurons following Neurog1 induction. Our data reveal a significant reduction in resting membrane potential (RMP) following neurotrophin exposure, with BDNF producing a more robust effect than NT-3. This effect was accompanied by a profound and specific upregulation of the KCNQ4 subtype, where a 9-fold increase was observed with quantitative PCR. The other neuronally expressed KCNQ subtypes (2, 3, and 5) exhibited upregulation which was 3-fold or less in magnitude. Quantitative immunohistochemistry confirmed the increase in KCNQ4 expression at the protein level. The present data show a novel link between BDNF and KCNQ4 expression, yielding insight into the restricted expression pattern of a channel known to play special roles in setting the resting potential of auditory cells and in the etiology of progressive high\u2010frequency hearing loss.",

Current research strategies aim to isolate, enrich, and propagate homogeneous populations of neural stem cells. Unfortunately, several concerns with NSC cultures currently may limit their therapeutic promise. Exhaustion of growth factors and/or their uncontrolled release with burst and fall in their concentration may greatly affect the in vitro behavior of NSCs. In this context, we investigate whether a device containing heparan sulfate (HS), which is a co-factor in growth factor-mediated cell proliferation and differentiation, could potentiate and prolong the delivery of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) and thus improve in vitro NSC cultivation. We demonstrated that NSCs cultivated in media with a controlled release of FGF-2 from a polyelectrolyte polymer showed a higher proliferation rate, and reduced apoptosis and senescence. In these experimental conditions NSCs preserve their stemness properties for a longer period of time compared with controls. Also of interest is that cell fate properties are conserved as well. The controlled release of FGF-2 reduced the level of oxidative stress and this is associated with a lower level of damaged DNA. This result may explain the reduced level of senescence and apoptosis in NSCs cultivated in the presence of hydrogel-releasing FGF-2.",

We aimed to generate endothelial progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells to facilitate the study of human EC physiology, using a defined serum-free protocol. Human embryonic stem cells (hESC-ECs) differentiated under serum-free conditions generated CD34+KDR+ endothelial progenitor cells after 6\u00a0days that could be further expanded in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The resultant EC population expressed CD31 and TIE2/TEK, took up acetylated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and up-regulated expression of ICAM-1, PAI-1 and ET-1 following treatment with TNF\u03b1. Immunofluorescence studies indicated that a key mediator of vascular tone, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), was localised to a perinuclear compartment of hESC-ECs, in contrast with the pan-cellular distribution of this enzyme within human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs). Further investigation revealed that that the serum-associated lipids, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and platelet activating factor (PAF), were the key molecules that affected eNOS localisation in hESC-ECs cultures. These studies illustrate the feasibility of EC generation from hESCs and the utility of these cells for investigating environmental cues that impact on EC phenotype.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate hiPSCs, HLCs and hepatocytes, all of human origin, in terms of performance metrics of relevance to cell therapies. hiPSCs were differentiated to HLCs in vitro using an established four-stage approach. We observed that hiPSCs had low oxygen consumption and possessed small, immature mitochondria located around the nucleus. With maturation to HLCs, mitochondria showed characteristic changes in morphology, ultrastructure, and gene expression. These changes in mitochondria included elongated morphology, swollen cristae, dense matrices, cytoplasmic migration, increased expression of mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication-related genes, and increased oxygen consumption. Following differentiation, HLCs expressed characteristic hepatocyte proteins including albumin and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-alpha, and intrinsic functions including cytochrome P450 metabolism. But HLCs also expressed high levels of alpha fetoprotein, suggesting a persistent immature phenotype or inability to turn off early stage genes. Furthermore, the levels of albumin production, urea production, cytochrome P450 activity, and mitochondrial function of HLCs were significantly lower than primary human hepatocytes.- hiPSCs offer an unlimited source of human HLCs. However, reduced functionality of HLCs compared to primary human hepatocytes limits their usefulness in clinical practice. Novel techniques are needed to complete differentiation of hiPSCs to mature hepatocytes.",

Continuous treatment with drugs targeting G\u03b1s-, G\u03b1-i/o- and G\u03b1-q/11-subunit signalling mediators were assessed in independent hESC lines after 7\u00a0days to discern effects on normalised alkaline phosphatase positive colony frequency vs total cell content. This identified PLC\u03b2, intracellular free calcium and CAMKII kinase activity downstream of G\u03b1-q/11 as of particular importance to the former. To confirm the significance of this finding we generated an agonist-responsive hESC line transgenic for a G\u03b1-q/11 subunit-coupled receptor and demonstrated that an undifferentiated state could be promoted in the presence of an agonist without exogenously supplied bFGF and that this correlated with elevated intracellular calcium. Similarly, treatment of unmodified hESCs with a range of intracellular free calcium-modulating drugs in biologically defined mTESR culture system lacking exogenous bFGF promoted an hESC phenotype after 1\u00a0week of continuous culture as defined by co-expression of OCT4 and NANOG. At least one of these drugs, lysophosphatidic acid significantly elevates phosphorylation of calmodulin and STAT3 in this culture system (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

We have determined that treatment of human ESC-derived OPCs with the pleiotropic cytokine IFN-\u03b3 promotes apoptosis that is associated with mitochondrial cytochrome c released into the cytosol with subsequent caspase 3 activation. IFN-\u03b3-induced apoptosis is mediated, in part, by secretion of the CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) from IFN-\u03b3-treated cells. Signaling through the chemokine receptor CXCR2 by the ligand CXCL1 functions in a tonic manner by muting apoptosis and this is associated with reduced levels of cytosolic cytochrome c and impaired cleavage of caspase 3. These findings support a role for both IFN-\u03b3 and CXCL10 in contributing to neuropathology by promoting OPC apoptosis.

To deepen this knowledge we investigated the influence of hypoxia (2% O2) and prolonged passaging (>\u00a0P10) of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) on the expression of genes involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle regulation pathways, as well as on the occurrence of microsatellite instability and changes in telomere length. Our results show that hypoxic conditions induce an immediate and concerted down-regulation of genes involved in DNA repair and damage response pathways (MLH1, RAD51, BRCA1, and Ku80), concomitantly with the occurrence of microsatellite instability while maintaining telomere length. We further searched for mutations occurring in the mitochondrial genome, and monitored changes in intracellular ATP content, membrane potential and mitochondrial DNA content. Hypoxia led to a simultaneous decrease in ATP content and in the number of mitochondrial genomes, whereas the opposite effect was observed after prolonged passaging. Moreover, we show that neither hypoxia nor prolonged passaging significantly affected the integrity of the mitochondrial genome. Ultimately, we present evidence on how hypoxia selectively impacts the cellular response of BMSCs and ASCs, thus pointing for the need to optimize oxygen tension according to the cell source.",

CD20, CD24, CD44, CD133, CD184 (CXCR4), CD326 (EpCam, ESA), Sox-2, OCT 3/4, and the side-population (SP) were tested in five PC cell lines, and the effects of confluency, hypoxia, radiation, and gemcitabine on the SP. The testing phase suggested several putative PCSC populations that were further tested and validated for their tumor-initiating capacity against known PCSC in 3 established and 1 fresh PC cell lines. Cell surface and intracellular markers showed significant variability among cell lines. SP was the only common marker in all cell lines and consistently less than 1%. SP response to confluence, hypoxia, radiation, and gemcitabine was inconsistent between cell lines.

Tumor initiation capacity tests in nude mice confirmed their increased tumorigenicity over previously reported PCSC.

     "abstract": "Regenerative medicine, relying on human embryonic stem cell (hESC) technology, opens promising new avenues for therapy of many severe diseases. However, this approach is restricted by limited production of the desired cells due to the refractory properties of hESC growth in vitro. It is further hindered by insufficient control of cellular stress, growth rates, and heterogeneous cellular states under current culture conditions. In this study, we report a novel cell culture method based on a non-colony type monolayer (NCM) growth. Human ESCs under NCM remain pluripotent as determined by teratoma assays and sustain the potential to differentiate into three germ layers. This NCM culture has been shown to homogenize cellular states, precisely control growth rates, significantly increase cell production, and enhance hESC recovery from cryopreservation without compromising chromosomal integrity. This culture system is simple, robust, scalable, and suitable for high-throughput screening and drug discovery.",

In the present study, we tested the bystander effect of this treatment strategy when using human BMSCs as the vector cells. Human BMSCtk cells were mixed with various kinds of brain tumor cell lines (human and rat glioma cells) and examined in vitro and in vivo tumoricidal bystander effects, by co-culture study and co-implantation study in the nude mouse, respectively. A significant in vitro bystander effect was observed between human BMSCtk cells and any of the tumor cells examined in the ganciclovir-containing medium. A potent in vivo bystander effect against human and rat glioma cells was also demonstrated when ganciclovir was administered. Migratory activity of the human BMSCs toward the tumor cells was enhanced by the conditioned media obtained from both human and rat glioma cells compared to the fresh media. The results of this study have demonstrated that the bystander effect generated by BMSCtk cells and ganciclovir is not cell type-specific, suggesting that the strategy would be quite feasible for clinical use.",

The present study describes proton\u2010gated current in mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), by using whole cell patch clamp. Rapid application of extracellular solution of pH\u00a0\u2264\u00a06.5, evoked slow inactivating current with mean peak value of 328\u00a0\u00b1\u00a031\u00a0pA, (n\u00a0=\u00a025) at pH 5.0. The reversal potential was close to the theoretical Na+ equilibrium potential, indicating that majority of the current is mediated by Na+ and partially carried by Ca2+ as revealed by ion substitution experiments and Ca2+ imaging. ASICs blocker amiloride (1\u00a0mM) and nonselective cation channel blocker flufenamic acid (0.3\u00a0mM) reduced the current amplitudes by 36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05% (n\u00a0=\u00a010) and 39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% (n\u00a0=\u00a014) respectively. Co-application of flufenamic acid and amiloride further decreased the current by 70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07% (n\u00a0=\u00a07). However, capsazepine, SKF 96365 and ruthenium red had no effect. 10\u00a0mM of Ca2+ and 2\u00a0mM of La3+ inhibited the current by 39\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% (n\u00a0=\u00a05) and 46\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06% (n\u00a0=\u00a04) respectively.

Oct4A is a master regulator of self-renewal in pluripotent stem cells.

Furthermore, we have examined the expression pattern of these isoforms in non-pluripotent cells and their function in somatic cell reprogramming. The results revealed the isoforms 247aa, 164aa localized mainly in nucleus and 190aa expressed dotted in the cytoplasm. In contrast to Oct4A, Oct4B does not function in somatic reprogramming as that of Oct4A. Taken together, our data for first time described the intact coding sequence of mouse Oct4B and its function in somatic cell reprogramming. These findings will be important for further analysis of the epigenetic mechanisms of reprogramming and highlight the necessity of discriminating Oct4 isoforms in future stem cell research.",

     "abstract": "Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplantation has emerged as a promising therapy, but it is challenged by scarcity of stem cells. Eltrombopag is a non-peptide, thrombopoietin (TPO) receptor agonist, which selectively activates c-Mpl in humans and chimpanzees. We investigated eltrombopag's effects on human UCB hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) expansion, and its effects on hematopoiesis in vivo. Eltrombopag selectively augmented the expansion of human CD45+, CD34+, and CD41+ cells in bone marrow compartment without effects on mouse bone marrow cells in the NOD/SCID mice xenotransplant model. Consequently, eltrombopag increased peripheral human platelets and white blood cells. We further examined effects in the STAT and AKT signaling pathways in serum-free cultures. Eltrombopag expanded human CD34+ CD38\u2212, CD34+, and CD41+ cells. Both eltrombopag and recombinant human TPO (rhTPO) induced phosphorylation of STAT5 of CD34+ CD41\u2212, CD34\u2212 CD41+, and CD34\u2212 CD41\u2212 cells. rhTPO preferentially induced pSTAT3, pAKT, and more pSTAT5 in CD34\u2212 C41+ cells, while eltrombopag had no effects on pSTAT3. In conclusion, eltrombopag enhanced expansion of HSCs/HPCs of human UCB in vivo and in vitro, and promoted multi-lineage hematopoiesis through the expansion of bone marrow HSCs/HPCs of human UCB in vivo. Eltrombopag differed somewhat from rhTPO in the signal transduction pathways by favoring earlier HSC/HPC populations.",

Two hiPSC lines, hiPSC (1) and hiPSC (2) were generated from human dermal fibroblasts using OCT-4, SOX-2, KLF-4, c-Myc via retroviral-based reprogramming. H9 human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) served as control. CMs and MSCs were co-generated from hiPSCs and hESCs via embryoid body-dependent cardiac differentiation protocol involving a serum-free and insulin-depleted medium containing a p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB 203580. Comparing to bone marrow and umbilical cord blood-derived MSCs, hiPSC-derived MSCs (iMSCs) expressed common MSC markers and were capable of adipogenesis, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. Moreover, iMSCs continuously proliferated for more than 32 population doublings without cellular senescence and showed superior pro-angiogenic and wound healing properties. In summary, we generated a large number of homogenous MSCs in conjunction with CMs in a low-cost and efficient one step manner. Functionally competent CMs and MSCs co-generated from hiPSCs may be useful for autologous cardiac repair.",

     "abstract": "Dysfunction and loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) are major pathologic changes observed in various retinal degenerative diseases such as aged-related macular degeneration. RPE generated from human pluripotent stem cells can be a good candidate for RPE replacement therapy. Here, we show the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward RPE with the generation of spherical neural masses (SNMs), which are pure masses of hESCs-derived neural precursors. During the early passaging of SNMs, cystic structures arising from opened neural tube-like structures showed pigmented epithelial morphology. These pigmented cells were differentiated into functional RPE by neuroectodermal induction and mechanical purification. Most of the differentiated cells showed typical RPE morphologies, such as a polygonal-shaped epithelial monolayer, and transmission electron microscopy revealed apical microvilli, pigment granules, and tight junctions. These cells also expressed molecular markers of RPE, including Mitf, ZO-1, RPE65, CRALBP, and bestrophin. The generated RPE also showed phagocytosis of isolated bovine photoreceptor outer segment and secreting pigment epithelium\u2010derived factor and vascular endothelial growth factor. Functional RPE could be generated from SNM in our method. Because SNMs have several advantages, including the capability of expansion for long periods without loss of differentiation capability, easy storage and thawing, and no need for feeder cells, our method for RPE differentiation may be used as an efficient strategy for generating functional RPE cells for retinal regeneration therapy.",

     "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in embryonic stem (ES) cells are repaired primarily by homologous recombination (HR). The mechanism by which HR is regulated in these cells, however, remains enigmatic. To gain insight into such regulatory mechanisms, we have asked how protein levels of Rad51, a key component of HR, are controlled in mouse ES cells and mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). The Rad51 protein level is about 15-fold higher in ES cells than in MEFs. The level of Rad51 mRNA, however, is only ~\u00a02-fold higher, indicating that the differences in mRNA levels due to rates of transcription or mRNA stability are not sufficient to account for the large difference in the abundance of Rad51 protein. Comparison of Rad51 half-lives between ES cells and MEFs also did not explain the elevated level of Rad51 protein in the ES cells. A comparative assessment of the Rad51 translation level demonstrated that it is translated with much greater efficacy in ES cells than in MEFs. To determine whether this high level of translation in ES cells is a general phenomenon in these cells or whether it is a characteristic of specific proteins, such as those involved with recombination and cell cycle progression, we compared mechanisms that regulate the level of Pcna in ES cells with those that regulate Rad51. The half-life of Pcna and its rate of synthesis were considerably different from those of Rad51 in ES cells, demonstrating that regulation of Rad51 abundance cannot be generalized to other ES cell proteins and not to proteins involved in DNA replication and cell cycle control. Finally, we show that only a small proportion of the abundant Rad51 protein population is activated under basal conditions in ES cells and recruited to DNA DSBs and/or stalled replication forks.",

MSC labeled with SPION were injected into the striatum 1\u00a0h after quinolinic acid injection. FJ-C analysis demonstrated that MSC transplantation significantly decreased the number of degenerating neurons in the damaged striatum 7\u00a0days after lesion. In this period, MSC transplantation enhanced the striatal expression of FGF-2 but did not affect subventricular zone proliferation, as demonstrated by Ki67 proliferation assay. In addition, MSC transplantation significantly reduced the ventriculomegaly in the lesioned brain. MRI and histological techniques detected the presence of the SPION-labeled cells at the lesion site. SPION-labeled MSC produced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals that were visible for at least 60\u00a0days after transplantation.

However, it is still unknown what signals endow astroglial cells with a de-differentiation potential. Furthermore, the signaling molecules and underlying mechanism that confer astrocytes with the competence of NSPC phenotypes have not been completely elucidated. Here, we found that sonic hedgehog (Shh) production in astrocytes following mechanical injury was significantly elevated, and that incubation of astrocyes with the injured astrocyte conditioned medium (ACM) causes astrocytes to gradually lose their immunophenotypical profiles, and acquire NSPC characteristics, as demonstrated by down-regulation of typical astrocytic markers (GFAP and S100) and up-regulation of markers that are generally expressed in NSCs, (nestin, Sox2, and CD133). ACM treated astrocytes exhibit self-renewal capacity and multipotency similar to NSPCs. Concomitantly, in addition to Ptc, there was a significant up-regulation of the Shh downstream signal components Gli2 and Cyclin D1 which are involved in cell proliferation, dramatic changes in cell morphology, and the disruption of cell-cycle G1 arrest. Conversely, the depletion of Shh by administration of its neutralizing antibody (Shh n-Ab) effectively inhibited the de-differentiation process. Strikingly, Shh alone had little effect on astrocyte de-differentiation to NSPCs. These data above suggest that Shh is a key instructive molecule while other molecules secreted from insulted astrocytes may synergistically promote the de-differentiation event.",

Treatment with the inhibitors of PI3-K (LY294002), Akt (SH-5), MEK1/2 (U0126), and JNK1/2 (SP600125) attenuated the outgrowth area, indicating that PI3-K/Akt, p42/p44 MAPK, and JNK1/2 are involved in the outgrowth of intact AM-expanded limbal epithelial cells. However, MMP-9 expression at both transcriptional and translational levels was attenuated by treatment with SP600125, LY294002, or SH-5, not by U0126 and SB202190, suggesting that JNK1/2 and PI3-K/Akt participate in MMP-9 expression.

Helenalin, a selective NF-\u03baB inhibitor, reduced both the limbal epithelial outgrowth and MMP-9 expression. Finally, the data reveal that PI3-K/Akt is an upstream component of the JNK1/2 pathway in MMP-9 expression.

     "abstract": "The main physiological function of adipose-derived stromal/progenitor cells (ASC) is to differentiate into adipocytes. ASC are most likely localized at perivascular sites in adipose tissues and retain the capacity to differentiate into multiple cell types. Although cell surface markers for ASC have been described, there is no complete consensus on the antigen expression pattern that will precisely define these cells. DLK1(PREF1) is an established marker for mouse adipocyte progenitors which inhibits adipogenesis. This suggests that DLK1(PREF1) could be a useful marker to characterize human ASC. The DLK1(PREF1) status of human ASC is however unknown. In the present study we isolated ASC from the heterogeneous stromal vascular fraction of subcutaneous abdominal fat pats of adult women. These cells were selected by their plastic adherence and expanded to passage 5. The ASC were characterized as relatively homogenous cell population with the capacity to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts and the immunophenotype CD105+/CD90+/CD34+/CD31\u2212/FABP4\u2212. The ASC were positive for DLK1(PREF1) which was well expressed in proliferating and density arrested cells but downregulated in the course of adipogenic differentiation. To investigate whether DLK1(PREF1) plays a role in the regulation of adipogenesis in these cells RNAi-mediated knockdown experiments were conducted. Knockdown of DLK1(PREF1) in differentiating ASC resulted in a significant increase of the expression of the adipogenic key regulator PPAR\u03b32 and of the terminal adipogenic differentiation marker FABP4. We conclude that DLK1(PREF1) is well expressed in human ASC and acts as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Moreover, DLK1(PREF1) could be a functional marker contributing to the characterization of human ASC.",

Differentiation into the embryonic endoderm and its derivatives is of special interest since it can provide a cure for severe widespread clinical conditions such as diabetes and hepatic failure. In this work we established a unique experimental outline that enables the study of early human endoderm development and can help improve and create new differentiation protocols. To this end we started with mesendoderm cells and separated them into early endoderm and mesoderm progenitor cells using CXCR4 and PDGFRA cell surface markers. We molecularly characterized the different lineages, and demonstrated the importance of the TGF\u03b2 pathway in definitive endoderm initiation. The endoderm progenitor cells were then purified creating an endodermal differentiation niche that is not affected by other cell populations. We followed the differentiation of these cells at different time points, and demonstrated an up regulation of genes indicative to differentiation into both foregut and hindgut. Surprisingly, upon continued culture, there was significant down regulation of the hepatic gene signature. This down regulation could be rescued with FGF2 treatment demonstrating its importance in hepatic cell maintenance. In conclusion, we suggest that isolating endoderm progenitor cells is crucial for the analysis of their fate, and enables the identification of factors involved in their differentiation and maintenance.",

To date, it remains unclear whether IGF-1 can regulate the function of SCAPs. In this study, SCAPs were isolated and purified from human immature root apex, and stimulated by 100\u00a0ng/mL exogenous IGF-1. The effects of IGF-1 on the proliferation and differentiation of SCAPs were subsequently investigated. IGF-1 treated SCAPs presented the morphological and ultrastructural changes. Cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineralization capacity of SCAPs were increased by IGF-1. Western blot and quantitative RT-PCR analyses further demonstrated that the expression of osteogenic-related proteins and genes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, runt-related transcription factor 2, osterix, and osteocalcin) was significantly up-regulated in IGF-1 treated SCAPs, whereas the expression of odontoblast-specific markers (e.g., dentin sialoprotein and dentin sialophosphoprotein) was down-regulated by IGF-1. In vivo results revealed that IGF-1 treated SCAPs mostly gave birth to bone-like tissues while untreated SCAPs mainly generated dentin-pulp complex-like structures after transplantation. The present study revealed that IGF-1 can promote the osteogenic differentiation and osteogenesis capacity of SCAPs, but weaken their odontogenic differentiation and dentinogenesis capability, indicating that IGF-1 treated SCAPs can be used as a potential candidate for bone tissue engineering.",

However, poor viability of transplanted BMSCs within ischemic tissues has limited their therapeutic potential. Apelin, an endogenous peptide, whose level is elevated following ischemia, has been shown to enhance survival of cardiomyocytes and neuronal cells during ischemia. We hypothesized that apelin-13 protects BMSCs from apoptotic death. In this paper we determined the potential mechanism of apelin-13 effects using cultured BMSCs from adult rats. Apoptosis was induced by the specific apoptotic insult serum deprivation (SD) for up to 36\u00a0h. Apoptotic cell death was measured using immunostaining and Western blotting in the presence and absence of apelin-13 (0.1 to 5.0\u00a0nM) co-applied during SD exposure. SD-induced apoptosis was significantly reduced by apelin-13 in a concentration-dependent manner. SD-induced mitochondrial depolarization, cytochrome c release, and caspase-3 activation were largely prevented by apelin-13. The apelin-13 anti-apoptotic effects were blocked by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways. Taken together, our findings indicate that apelin-13 is a survival factor for BMSCs and its anti-apoptotic property may prove to be of therapeutic significance in terms of exploiting BMSC-based transplantation therapy.",

With optimized cell seeding density and splitting interval, we demonstrate prolonged passaging and expansion of several hESC lines with overall expansion, yield, viability and maintenance of pluripotency equivalent to adherent culture. Human ESCs maintained in suspension as aggregates can be passaged at least 20 times to achieve over 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a01013 fold calculated expansion with high undifferentiation rate and normal karyotype. Furthermore, the aggregates are able to differentiate to cardiomyocytes in a directed fashion.

We have successfully used this method under cGMP or cGMP-equivalent conditions to generate cell banks of several hESC lines.

In doing so, we provide evidence to show that compressive load can improve the stiffness of collagen substrates. In addition Western blotting and immunohistochemistry display increased cytokeratin 3 (CK3) protein expression relating to limbal epithelial cell differentiation on stiff collagen substrates. Such gels with an elastic modulus of 2900\u00a0Pa supported a significantly higher number of cells than less stiff collagen gels (3\u00a0Pa).

Furthermore, in vitro stem cell assays and Bmi1 knockdown show that Bmi1 contributes to self-renewal in CD133\u00a0+ populations, but regulates proliferation and cell fate determination in CD133\u00a0\u2212 populations. Finally, we test if our in vitro stem cell assays and Bmi1 expression in BTIC patient isolates are predictive of clinical outcome for GBM patients.

We first examined the overall chromosomal integrity using cytogenetic techniques to determine chromosome count, and to detect the presence of cytogenetically aberrant cells in the culture (mosaicism). Assays of copy number variation, using both microarray and sequence-based analyses, provide a detailed view genomic variation in these lines and shows that in early passage cultures of these lines, the size range and distribution of CNVs are entirely consistent with those seen in the genomes of normal individuals. Similarly, genome sequencing shows variation within these lines that is completely within the range seen in normal genomes. Important gene classes, such as tumor suppressors and genetic disease genes, do not display overtly disruptive mutations that could affect the overall safety of cell-based therapeutics. Complete sequence also allows the analysis of important transplantation antigens, such as ABO and HLA types.

Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) fates are tightly regulated by humoral factors, cellular interactions and extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAG), which are complex polysaccharides with structural heterogeneity. During osteogenesis, a temporally controlled expression of particular GAG species is required to interact with specific growth promoting and differentiating factors to regulate their biological activities. As a comparative tool to study natural GAG, we used structurally and functionally related synthetic GAG mimetics. One of these compounds [OTR4120] was previously shown to stimulate bone repair in rat models. Here, we demonstrate that structurally distinct GAG mimetics stimulate differentially clonogenicity, proliferation, migration and osteogenic phenotype of MSC in vitro, according to their specific chemical signature, underlying the role of sulfate and acetyl groups in specific interactions with heparin binding factors (HBF). These effects are dependent on FGF-2 interactions since they are inhibited by a FGF receptor 1 signaling pathway blocker. These data suggest that the in vivo [OTR4120] bone regenerative effect could be due to its ability to induce MSC migration and osteogenic differentiation. To conclude, we provide evidences showing that GAG mimetics may have great interest for bone regeneration therapy and represent an alternative to exogenous growth factor treatments to optimize potential therapeutic properties of MSC.",

In this study we examine the regulation of the tropomyosin-related kinase (TRK) genes which encode for receptors important in hES cell survival and self-renewal. Although the TRK genes have been studied in many neuronal cell types, the regulation of these genes in hES cells is unclear. Our study demonstrates a novel regulatory relationship between the TRKC gene and the transcription factor SOX2. Our results found that hES cells highly express full-length and truncated forms of the TRKC gene. However, examination of the related TRKB gene showed a lower overall expression of both full-length and truncated forms. Through RNA interference, we knocked down expression levels of SOX2 in hES cells and examined the expression of TRKC, as well as TRKB. Upon loss of SOX2 we found that TRKC mRNA levels were significantly downregulated but TRKB levels remained unchanged, demonstrating an important regulatory dependence on SOX2 by TRKC. We also found that TRKC protein levels were also decreased after SOX2 knock down. Further analysis found the regulatory region of TRKC to be highly conserved among many mammals with potential SOX binding motifs. We confirmed a specific binding motif as a site that SOX2 utilizes to directly interact with the TRKC regulatory region. In addition, we found that SOX2 drives expression of the TRKC gene by activating a luciferase reporter construct containing the TRKC regulatory region and the SOX binding motif.",

In order to study the age associated changes, the molecular characteristics of adipose tissue derived MSCs (ASCs) from three age groups of healthy volunteers i.e., young, middle aged, and aged were investigated. The number and multilineage differentiation potential of ASCs declined with age. Aging reduces the proliferative capacity along with increases in cellular senescence. A significant increase in quiescence of G2 and S phase was observed in ASCs from aged donors. The expression of genes related to senescence such as CHEK1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p16ink4a was increased with age, however genes of apoptosis were downregulated. Further, an age-dependent abnormality in the expression of DNA break repair genes was observed. Global microRNA analysis revealed an abnormal expression of mir-27b, mir-106a, mir-199a, and let-7. In ubiquitously distributed adipose tissue (and ASCs), aging brings about important alterations, which might be critical for tissue regeneration and homeostasis.

     "abstract": "While damaged peripheral nerves demonstrate some potential to regenerate, complete functional recovery remains infrequent, owing to a functional loss of supportive Schwann cells distal to the injury. An emerging solution to improve upon this intrinsic regenerative capacity is to supplement injured nerves with stem cells derived from various tissues. While many of these strategies have proven successful in animal models, few studies have examined the behavior of transplanted stem cells in vivo, including whether they survive and differentiate. In previous work, we demonstrated that cells derived from neonatal rodent dermis (skin-derived precursor cells, or SKPs) could improve regenerative parameters when transplanted distal to both acute and chronic nerve injuries in Lewis rats. The aim of this work was to track the fate of these cells in various nerve injury paradigms and determine the response of these cells to a known glial growth factor. Here, we report that SKPs survive, respond to local cues, differentiate into myelinating Schwann cells, and avoid complete clearance by the host's immune defenses for a minimum of 10\u00a0weeks. Moreover, the ultimate fate of SKPs in vivo depends on the nerve environment into which they are injected and can be modified by inclusion of heregulin-1\u03b2.",

     "abstract": "The in vitro neuralization of hESCs has been widely used to generate central and peripheral nervous system components from neural precursors (Bajpai et al., 2009; Curchoe et al., 2010), most often through an intermediate \u201crosette\u201d stage. Here we confirm that hESC derived neuro-epithelial rosettes express many characteristics of the developing embryonic neural plate (Aaku-Saraste et al., 1996), characterized by expression of the tight junction proteins ZO-1 and N-Cadherin. Moreover, neuro-epithelial rosettes display a characteristic acetylated alpha tubulin cytoskeletal arrangement (similar to that observed in the developing embryonic neural plate) (Bhattacharyya et al., 1994).Demonstrated here for the first time MKLP was observed in a hESC model system. We found MKLP expression in small particles in between mitotic spindles, large particles aggregating in the lumen of neuroepithelial rosettes, and we did not observe MKLP in the nucleus of hESC derived neural precursors as previously described in the HeLa cell line. We observed MKLP\u00a0+ particles in aggregations in the lumen of \u201cearly\u201d rosette structures. Furthermore, we observed that MKLP+ particle aggregations can also be lost from the lumens of hESC derived neuro-epithelial rosettes, similar to a phenomenon observed in the developing neural tube in vivo (Marzesco et al., 2005). We determined that this loss of MKLP+ particles occurs from \u201clate\u201d as opposed to \u201cearly\u201d stage neuro-epithelial rosettes (characterized by junction type).Disrupting the apical-basal polarization of \u201cearly\u201d stage rosettes with a 1% Matrigel overlay (Krtolica et al., 2007) nearly ablates MKLP particle aggregation in the lumen of rosettes, demonstrating that the apical-basal polarity of early NE cells is necessary for lumenal MKLP particle aggregation.We conclude that early hESC derived neuro-epithelial rosettes can model early neurulation events, such as the transition from neural plate like cells to neural tube like cells (i.e. symmetric to asymmetric NE cell division) demonstrated by polarized MKLP particle inheritance and distribution using junction type as a measure of stage.",

Human Adipose Tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) were transduced to express (i) the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) reporter transgene, (ii) the fusion yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CDy::UPRT) enzyme along with the expression of dominant positive selection gene NeoR or (iii) the selection marker NeoR alone (MOCK). CDy::UPRT expression resulted in increased proliferation of CDy::UPRT-MSCs versus na\u00efve AT-MSCs, MOCK-MSCs or EGFP-MSCs. Furthermore, CDy::UPRT-MSCs were significantly more sensitive to 5-fluorouracil (5FU), cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and cytosine arabinoside as determined by increased Caspase 3/7 activation and/or decreased relative proliferation. CDy::UPRT-MSCs in direct cocultures with breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231 increased tumor cell killing induced by low concentrations of 5FU.

Here, we report for the first time that human dermal fibroblasts from a patient with relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) were reprogrammed to pluripotency by retroviral transduction using defined factors (OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC). The MSiPS cell lines resembled human embryonic stem (hES) cell-like colonies in morphology and gene expression and exhibited silencing of the retroviral transgenes after four passages. MSiPS cells formed embryoid bodies that expressed markers of all three germ layers by immunostaining and Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR. The injection of undifferentiated iPS cell colonies into immunodeficient mice formed teratomas, thereby demonstrating pluripotency. The MSiPS cells were successfully differentiated into mature astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons with normal karyotypes. Although MSiPS-derived neurons displayed some differences in their electrophysiological characteristics as compared to the control cell line, they exhibit properties of functional neurons, with robust resting membrane potentials, large fast tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials and voltage-gated sodium currents. This study provides for the first time proof of concept that disease cell lines derived from skin cells obtained from an MS patient can be generated and successfully differentiated into mature neural lineages. This represents an important step in a novel approach for the study of MS pathophysiology and potential drug discovery.",

The overexpression of the cystine-glutamate exchanger, system Xc\u2212, has been demonstrated as being neuroprotective (Shih, Erb et al. 2006). Here, using immunohistochemistry, we demonstrate that C57BL/6 mice exposed to hypoxia showed an increase in system Xc\u2212 expression, with the highest level of intensity in the hippocampus. Western Blot analysis also showed an almost 2-fold increase in system Xc\u2212 protein in hypoxia-exposed versus control mice. The mRNA for the regulatory subunit of system Xc\u2212, xCT, and the xCT/actin ratio were also increased under hypoxic conditions. Experiments using hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1) siRNA showed a statistically significant decrease in HIF-1\u03b1 and system Xc\u2212 expression. Under hypoxic conditions, system Xc\u2212 activity, as determined by cystine uptake, increased 2-fold. Importantly, hypoxic preconditioning was attenuated in neural stem cells by pharmacological inhibition of system Xc\u2212 activity with S4-carboxyphenylglycine.

In the present study, we isolated a chondrogenic cell population from human nasal septal cartilage surface zone. Nasoseptal chondrogenic cells were positive for surface markers described for mesenchymal stem cells, with exception of CD146, a perivascular cell marker, which is consistent with their avascular niche in cartilage. Although only Sox-9 was constitutively expressed, they also revealed osteogenic and chondrogenic, but not adipogenic, potentials in vitro, suggesting a more restricted lineage potential compared to mesenchymal stem cells. Interestingly, even in absence of chondrogenic growth factors in the pellet culture system, nasoseptal chondrogenic cells had a capacity to synthesize sulfated glycosaminoglycans, large amounts of collagen type II and to a lesser extent collagen type I. The spontaneous chondrogenic potential of this population of cells indicates that they may be a possible source for cartilage tissue engineering.

Previous studies have utilized a constitutive HoxB4 expression system or tetracycline-regulated HoxB4 expression system to induce hematopoietic cells from ES cells. However, these methods cannot be applied therapeutically due to the risk of transgenes being integrated into the host genome. Here, we report the promotion of hematopoietic differentiation from mouse ES cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells by transient HoxB4 expression using an adenovirus (Ad) vector. Ad vector could mediate efficient HoxB4 expression in ES cell-derived embryoid bodies (ES-EBs) and iPS-EBs, and its expression was decreased during cultivation, showing that Ad vector transduction was transient. A colony-forming assay revealed that the number of hematopoietic progenitor cells with colony-forming potential in HoxB4-transduced cells was significantly increased in comparison with that in non-transduced cells or LacZ-transduced cells. HoxB4-transduced cells also showed more efficient generation of CD41-, CD45-, or Sca-1-positive cells than control cells. These results indicate that transient, but not constitutive, HoxB4 expression is sufficient to augment the hematopoietic differentiation of ES and iPS cells, and that our method would be useful for clinical applications, such as cell transplantation therapy.",

     "abstract": "Pluripotency is a cellular state of multiple options. Here, we highlight the potential for self-organization to contribute to stem cell fate computation. A new way of considering regulatory circuitry is presented that describes the expression of each transcription factor (TF) as a branching process that propagates through time, interacting and competing with others. In a single cell, the interactions between multiple branching processes generate a collective process called \u2018critical-like self-organization\u2019. We explain how this phenomenon provides a valid description of whole genome regulatory circuit dynamics. The hypothesis of exploratory stem cell decision-making proposes that critical-like self-organization (also called rapid self-organized criticality) provides the backbone for cell fate computation in regulative embryos and pluripotent stem cells. Unspecific amplification of TF expression is predicted to initiate this self-organizing circuitry, where cascades of gene expression propagate and may interact either synergistically or antagonistically. The emergent and highly dynamic circuitry is affected by various sources of selection pressure, such as the expression of TFs with disproportionate influence over other genes, and extrinsic biological and physical stimuli that differentially modulate particular gene expression cascades. Extrinsic conditions continuously trigger waves of transcription that ripple throughout regulatory networks on multiple spatiotemporal scales, providing the context within which circuitry self-organizes. In this framework, a distinction between instructive and selective mechanisms of fate determination is misleading because it is the 'interference pattern', rather than any single instructing or selecting factor, that is ultimately responsible for computing and directing cell fate. Using this framework, we consider whether the idea of a na\u00efve ground state of pluripotency and that of a fluctuating transcriptome are compatible, and whether a ground state like that captured in vitro could exist in vivo.",

Bcl-xL is one of several anti-apoptotic proteins, which are members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. Using an inducible system, we ectopically expressed Bcl-xL gene in hESCs, and found a significant increase of hESC colonies in the single-cell suspension cultures. Overexpression of Bcl-xL in hESCs decreased apoptotic caspase-3+ cells, suggesting attenuation of apoptosis in hESCs. Without altering the kinetics of pluripotent gene expression, the efficiency to generate embryoid bodies (EBs) in vitro and the formation of teratoma in vivo were significantly increased in Bcl-xL-overexpressing hESCs after single-cell dissociation.

Several genes of extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules were upregulated by Bcl-xL in hESCs without single-cell dissociation, suggesting that Bcl-xL regulates adhesion molecular expression independent of cell dissociation. In addition, the gene expressions of FAS and several TNF signaling mediators were downregulated by Bcl-xL.These data support a model in which Bcl-xL promotes cell survival and increases cloning efficiency of dissociated hESCs without altering hESC self-renewal by i) attenuation of apoptosis, and ii) upregulation of adhesion molecules to facilitate cell\u2013cell or cell\u2013matrix interactions.",

We first used immunofluorescence to confirm the expression of endothelial progenitor markers in three lines of EPCs. We then cultured the progenitor cells in EFs. Using time\u2013lapse video microscopy, we demonstrated that an applied DC EF directs migration of the EPCs toward the cathode. The progenitor cells also align and elongate in an EF. Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor signaling completely abolished the EF-induced directional migration of the progenitor cells.

In addition, it is not clear whether these cells are true stem cells that can differentiate along multiple lineages or whether they represent a collection of progenitor cells with restricted differentiation potential. Here we report that hHF-MSCs are highly proliferative cells that can be maintained in culture for ~\u00a045 population doublings before they start to show signs of cellular senescence. Under appropriate culture conditions, hHF-MSCs differentiated along the myogenic, osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic lineages, as demonstrated by kinetic gene expression profiling and functional assays. Interestingly, the differentiation potential decreased with time in culture in a lineage-specific manner. Specifically, myogenesis and chondrogenesis showed a moderate decrease over time; osteogenesis was maximum at intermediate passages and adipogenesis was highly sensitive to long-term culture and was diminished at late passages. Finally, hHF-MSCs were clonally multipotent as the majority of hHF-MSCs clones (73%) demonstrated bi- or tri-lineage differentiation potential.

Expression of the mesoderm and EC marker genes, the known mediators of EC specification and their downstream targets was monitored by quantitative PCR, western blot, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. Functionality of the differentiated EC was assessed by in vitro angiogenesis assay and the induction of Icam1 expression in response to TNF-\u03b1 treatment. Both recombinant Eng and forced Eng expression increased the number of functional EC expressing the EC marker genes VE-cadherin, vWF, and Tie2, and enhanced the effect of BMP4.

The two fibroblast types were compared for their ECM protein synthesis, integrin receptor expression profiles and key growth factor secretion. We show that hESC supportive feeder cells produce laminin-511 and express laminin-binding integrins \u03b13\u00df1, \u03b16\u00df1 and \u03b17\u00df1. These results indicate specific laminin isoforms and integrins in maintenance of hESC pluripotency in feeder-dependent cultures. In addition, several genes with a known or possible role for hESC pluripotency were differentially expressed in distinct feeder cells.",

It is widely accepted that the corneal epithelium is maintained by stem cells but different hypotheses propose that the stem cells that maintain the mouse corneal epithelium during normal homeostasis are located either in the basal limbal epithelium or throughout the basal corneal epithelium. There are no specific markers to help test these alternatives and new methods are required to distinguish between them. We observed that KRT5LacZ/\u2212 transgenic mice produced rare \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal)-positive radial stripes in the corneal epithelium. These stripes are likely to be clonal lineages of cells derived from stem cells, so they provide a lineage marker for actively proliferating stem cells. The distributions of the \u03b2-gal-positive radial stripes suggested they extended centripetally from the limbus, supporting the limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) hypothesis. Stripe frequency declined between 15 and 30\u00a0weeks, which predicts a reduction in stem cell function with age. Pax6+/\u2212, KRT5LacZ/\u2212 corneas had small patches rather than stripes, which confirms that corneal maintenance is abnormal in Pax6+/\u2212 mice.",

Then, to find the role of somites (S) and notochords (N) in rostro-caudal (RC) and dorso-ventral (DV) patterning of neuronal cells, NPs were co-cultured with microencapsulated chicken S or N in alginate beads. In this study, N induced more neurogenesis as evaluated by expression of TUJ1 and MAP2-positive cells. Additionally, N induced spinal cord ventral brachiothoracic identity as well as NPs proliferation. We observed a synergic effect on motoneuron induction when S and N were used together. Moreover, S induced hindbrain identity in differentiated neuronal cells from NPs. These results indicate that highly enriched NPs can be generated in an adherent and defined system from hESCs. Moreover, S and N tissues highly influenced neuronal differentiation in point of proliferation, neurogenesis, and RC and DV regional identity.

However, the action of HIF-1\u03b1 on the differentiation of hESCs was unclear until now. To investigate the effect of hypoxia on the differentiation of hESCs, we compared the differentiation efficacy into vascular lineage cells under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. We observed HIF-1\u03b1 expression and the related expression of pro-angiogenic factors VEGF, bFGF, Ang-1 and PDGF in hEBs cultured under hypoxic conditions. Along with this, differentiation efficacy into vascular lineage cells was improved under hypoxic conditions. When HIF-1\u03b1 was blocked by echinomycin, both angiogenic factors and the differentiation efficacy were down-regulated, suggesting that the enhancement of differentiation efficacy was caused by intrinsic up-regulation of HIF-1\u03b1 and these pro-angiogenic factors under hypoxic condition. This response might be primarily regulated by the HIF-1\u03b1 signal pathway, and hypoxia might be the key to improving the differentiation of hESCs into vascular lineage cells.Therefore, this study demonstrated that microenvironmental changes (i.e., hypoxia) can improve differentiation efficacy of hESCs into a vascular lineage without exogenous factors via cell-intrinsic up-regulation of angiogenic factors. These facts will contribute to the regulation of stem cell fate.",

In addition to previous investigations on the crosstalk between these two cell types, in the present work different relative cell ratios were analyzed for long, therapeutically relevant, culture periods. Moreover, MSCs osteogenic commitment was assessed in a non-osteogenic medium and in the presence of HUVECs through magnetic cell separation, cell quantification by flow cytometry, morphology by fluorescent microscopy, metabolic activity and gene expression of osteogenic markers. Collectively, the present findings demonstrate that, by coculturing MSCs with HUVECs, there was not only the promotion of osteogenic differentiation (and its enhancement, depending on the relative cell ratios used), but also a significant increase on MSCs proliferation. This augmentation in cell proliferation occurred independently of relative cell ratios, but was favored by higher relative amounts of HUVECs. Taken together, this data suggests that HUVECs not only modulate MSC phenotype but also their proliferation rate. Therefore, a coculture system of MSCs and HUVECs can a have a broad impact on bone tissue engineering approaches.",

Upon further differentiation, phosphorylation dynamics in EBs were specifically altered by distinct inhibitor concentrations. At 5\u00a0\u03bcM of SB203580, cardiomyogenesis was most efficient and associated with the expected p38 pathway inhibition. In parallel, JNK activation was observed suggesting a regulatory interlink between these pathways in hESC ultimately supporting cardiac differentiation. In contrast, moderately elevated SB203580 concentrations (15\u201330\u00a0\u03bcM) resulted in complete disruption of cardiomyogenesis which was associated with prominent inhibition of ERK and further elevated JNK activity.We propose that a tightly-balanced pattern in MAPK phosphorylation is important for early mesoderm and subsequent cardiomyocyte formation.

In this study, we generated a transgenic fibroblast feeder line stably expressing a secretable FGF4 signal peptide tagged hFGF2 (4SP-hFGF2). The expression of this transgene functionally replaced the requirement for exogenous FGF2 when using these cells as feeders for the maintenance of hESCs. Under these conditions, hESCs maintained the typical marker of pluripotency assessed after long term culture, while still retaining the capacity for differentiation to all three germ layers.

A potent source of stem cells is the stromal vascular fraction of adipose tissue (SVF), which contains high numbers of adipose derived stem cells (ASC). We hypothesized that: 1) intravenous injection can be used to apply stem cells to the heart. 2) Uncultured SVF cells are easier and safer when cultured ASCs. 3) Transplantation after the acute inflammation period of AMI is favorable over early injection.For this, AMI was induced in rats by 40\u00a0min of coronary occlusion. One or seven days after AMI, rats were intravenously injected with vehicle, 5\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 uncultured rat SVF cells or 1\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106 rat ASCs.

Similar numbers of stem cells were found in the heart, after treatment with fresh SVF cells and cultured ASCs. Importantly, no adverse effects were found after injection of SVF cells. Using cultured ASCs, however, 3 animals had shortness of breath, and one animal died during injection. In contrast to application at 7\u00a0days post AMI, injection of SVF cells 1\u00a0day post AMI resulted in a small but non-significant infarct reduction (p\u00a0=\u00a00.35).

The CD34+ population comprised a CD31+/CD45\u2212 cell subset exhibiting endothelial characteristics and only capable of forming microvessels in vivo. The CD34+/CD31\u2212/CD45\u2212/Sca1+ subpopulation, which is restricted to the muscle epimysium, displayed adipogenic differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. CD34+/CD31\u2212/CD45\u2212/Sca1\u2212 cells, localized in the muscle interstitium, transcribed myogenic genes, but did not display the characteristics of adult satellite cells. These cells were distinct from pericytes and fibroblasts. They were myogenic in vitro, and efficiently contributed to skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo, although their myogenic potential was lower than that of the unfractionated CD34+ cell population.

Therefore, we aimed to clarify the role of the SDF1/CXCR4 axis with respect to the benefits of a dual stem cell based therapy.After surgically induced ligation of the LAD, SDF-1/CXCR4 interactions were specifically blocked by the CXCR4 receptor antagonist AMD3100 in G-CSF and Diprotin A treated C57BL/6 mice. G-CSF\u00a0+\u00a0DipA treated and non-treated animals served as controls. Because AMD3100 is known to mobilize bone marrow derived stem cells (BMCs) in high concentrations, the optimal dosage (1.25\u00a0mg\u00a0per\u00a0kg\u00a0body\u00a0weight) sufficient to block CXCR4 without stimulating mobilization was established. AMD3100 treatment of G-CSF and Diprotin A stimulated mice significantly decreased myocardial homing of circulating stem cells (FACS analysis) and inverted the beneficial effects of (i) cardiac remodeling (histological analyses), (ii) heart function (Millar tip catheterization) and (iii) survival (Kaplan\u2013Meier curves). G-CSF treatment in combination with DPP-IV inhibition enhanced neovascularization at the infarct border zone which was related to an improved myocardial blood flow as measured by SPECT. Moreover, dual stem cell treatment effectively stimulated the pool of resident cardiac stem cells (FACS) which was reversed by AMD3100 treatment.Our data give final proof that homing through the SDF-1/CXCR-4 axis is essential for the success of dual stem cell therapy.",

High attachment efficiency was observed on uncoated microcarriers, however poor cell growth and/or gradual loss of pluripotency occurred during continuous passaging. Coating of the microcarriers with Matrigel resulted in higher cell yields and stable pluripotent states for at least three passages. Positively charged cylindrical cellulose microcarriers (DE52, DE53 and QA52) and large (190\u00a0\u03bcm) positively charged spherical microcarriers (Cytodex 1) exhibited high cell expansion potential and levels of pluripotency. Lower cell yields were obtained using smaller diameter spherical (65\u00a0\u03bcm and 10\u00a0\u03bcm) or macroporous beads. Instead of Matrigel, laminin coated microcarriers (DE53 and Cytodex 1) are capable of supporting the long term propagation and pluripotency of HES-2 and HES-3 cell lines. HES-2 cell line which was shown earlier to be shear resistant achieved similar cell growth and expression of pluripotent markers when cultured on both Matrigel (84% Tra-1-60, 1.43\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells/ml) and laminin (74% Tra-1-60, 1.37\u00a0\u00d7\u00a0106\u00a0cells/ml) coated microcarriers in spinner flasks. In contrast, HES-3 exhibited a decrease in cell yield, viability and pluripotent markers on laminin as compared with Matrigel coated microcarriers possibly due to shear sensitivity.

We found that the tissue distribution of human and mouse MSCs was nearly identical after intravenous injection. In mice with MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma xenografts we found that a fraction of MSCs infiltrated the primary tumor mass, but that the general tissue distribution of MSCs was unaffected by the tumor-burden.

     "abstract": "Rex-1/Zfp42 displays a remarkably restricted pattern of expression in preimplantation embryos, primary spermatocytes, and undifferentiated mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells and is frequently used as a marker gene for pluripotent stem cells. To understand the role of Rex-1 in selfrenewal and pluripotency, we used Rex-1 association as a measure to identify potential target genes, and carried out chromatin-immunoprecipitation assays in combination with gene specific primers to identify genomic targets Rex-1 associates with. We find association of Rex-1 to several genes described previously as bivalently marked regulators of differentiation and development, whose repression in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells is Polycomb Group-mediated, and controlled directly by Ring1A/B. To substantiate the hypothesis that Rex-1 contributes to gene regulation by PcG, we demonstrate interactions of Rex-1 and YY2 (a close relative of YY1) with Ring1 proteins and the PcG-associated proteins RYBP and YAF2, in line with interactions reported previously for YY1. We also demonstrate the presence of Rex-1 protein in both trophectoderm and Inner Cell Mass of the mouse blastocyst and in both ES and in trophectoderm stem (TS) cells. In TS cells, we were unable to demonstrate association of Rex-1 to the genes it associates with in ES cells, suggesting that association may be cell-type specific. Rex-1 might fine-tune pluripotency in ES cells by modulating Polycomb-mediated gene regulation.",

Amniotic fluid-derived stem cells (AFS) and bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were compared to determine their osteogenic differentiation capacity in both 2D and 3D environments. In 2D culture, the AFS cells produced more mineralized matrix but delayed peaks in osteogenic markers. Cells were also cultured on 3D scaffolds constructed of poly-\u03b5-caprolactone for 15\u00a0weeks. MSCs differentiated more quickly than AFS cells on 3D scaffolds, but mineralized matrix production slowed considerably after 5\u00a0weeks. In contrast, the rate of AFS cell mineralization continued to increase out to 15\u00a0weeks, at which time AFS constructs contained 5-fold more mineralized matrix than MSC constructs. Therefore, cell source should be taken into consideration when used for cell therapy, as the MSCs would be a good choice for immediate matrix production, but the AFS cells would continue robust mineralization for an extended period of time. This study demonstrates that stem cell source can dramatically influence the magnitude and rate of osteogenic differentiation in vitro.",

Here, rhesus and baboons ESCs were investigated in interspecific mouse chimera generated by aggregation or blastocyst injection. Aggregation chimera produced mouse blastocysts with GFP-nhpESCs at the inner cell mass (ICM), and embryo transfers (ETs) generated dimly-fluorescencing abnormal fetuses. Direct injection of GFP-nhpESCs into blastocysts produced normal non-GFP-fluorescencing fetuses. Injected chimera showed >\u00a070% loss of GFP-nhpESCs after 21\u00a0h culture. Outgrowths of all chimeric blastocysts established distinct but separate mouse- and NHP-ESC colonies. Extensive endogenous autofluorescence compromised anti-GFP detection and PCR analysis did not detect nhpESCs in fetuses. NhpESCs localize to the ICM in chimera and generate pregnancies. Because primate ESCs do not engraft post-implantation, and also because endogenous autofluorescence results in misleading positive signals, interspecific chimera assays for pluripotency with primate stem cells is unreliable with the currently available ESCs. Testing primate ESCs reprogrammed into even more na\u00efve states in these inter-specific chimera assays will be an important future endeavor.",

The results showed that both the proliferation and differentiation of NSCs treated with stimulated ACMs were significantly increased compared with those treated with unstimulated ACM. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) antibody neutralization of the ACMs decreased NSC proliferation and astrogliogenesis, while NSC neurogenesis was increased. In contrast, recombinant IL-6 cytokine increased NSC proliferation and astrogliogenesis, but decreased neurogenesis. Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-stat3) protein as well as serial of basic helix\u2013loop\u2013helix transcription factors (bHLH) mRNA in NSCs exposed to stimulated ACMs significantly increased, respectively. The expression levels of p-stat3 protein and bHLH mRNA of NSCs were significantly altered after adding anti-IL-6 antibody or recombinant IL-6, respectively.

     "abstract": "The first event of differentiation in mammalian embryogenesis is the segregation of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm lineages in the blastocyst. Cellular and molecular events related to this process are still a controversial issue. During the years it was thought that first allocation of blastomeres before the blastocyst stage was done in the late eight-cell stage with the formation of inner and outer cells. Lately, many studies have pointed out that individual blastomeres at the four-cell stage differ in their developmental properties according to their position within the embryo. In this report, we wanted to elucidate whether these early decisions influence the production of mouse embryonic stem cell lines, so that a selective isolation of blastomeres at the four-cell stage to derive the lines could improve the efficiency of the derivation process. Results from blastomere tracking experiments support the idea of a different developmental potential of blastomeres within the four-cell stage embryo. However, we also show a high plasticity in the developmental pattern of blastomeres once isolated from the embryo, thus making all four-cell stage blastomeres equally competent to derive ESC lines.",

     "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) suppress T cell responses through mechanisms not completely understood. Adenosine is a strong immunosuppressant that acts mainly through its receptor A2a (ADORA2A). Extracellular adenosine levels are a net result of its production (mediated by CD39 and CD73), and of its conversion into inosine by Adenosine Deaminase (ADA). Here we investigated the involvement of ADO in the immunomodulation promoted by MSCs. Human T lymphocytes were activated and cultured with or without MSCs. Compared to lymphocytes cultured without MSCs, co-cultured lymphocytes were suppressed and expressed higher levels of ADORA2A and lower levels of ADA. In co-cultures, the percentage of MSCs expressing CD39, and of T lymphocytes expressing CD73, increased significantly and adenosine levels were higher. Incubation of MSCs with media conditioned by activated T lymphocytes induced the production of adenosine to levels similar to those observed in co-cultures, indicating that adenosine production was mainly derived from MSCs. Finally, blocking ADORA2A signaling raised lymphocyte proliferation significantly. Our results suggest that some of the immunomodulatory properties of MSCs may, in part, be mediated through the modulation of components related to adenosine signaling. These findings may open new avenues for the development of new treatments for GVHD and other inflammatory diseases.",

     "abstract": "Chromatin regulation is crucial for many biological processes such as transcriptional regulation, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair. We have found that it is also important for neural stem/progenitor cell (NSC) function and neurogenesis. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is specifically up-regulated in Mrg15 deficient NSCs. Knockdown of p21 expression by p21 shRNA results in restoration of cell proliferation. This indicates that p21 is directly involved in the growth defects observed in Mrg15 deficient NSCs. Activated p53 accumulates in Mrg15 deficient NSCs and this most likely accounts for the up-regulation of p21 expression in the cells. We observed decreased p53 and p21 levels and a concomitant increase in the percentage of BrdU positive cells in Mrg15 null cultures following expression of p53 shRNA. DNA damage foci, as indicated by immunostaining for \u03b3H2AX and 53BP1, are detectable in a sub-population of Mrg15 deficient NSC cultures under normal growing conditions and the majority of p21-positive cells are also positive for 53BP1 foci. Furthermore, Mrg15 deficient NSCs exhibit severe defects in DNA damage response following ionizing radiation.

Following immobilization of wild brown bears 7\u201310\u00a0days after leaving the den in mid-April, adipose tissue biopsies were obtained. ASCs were recovered from 6 bears, and shown to be able to undergo adipogenesis and osteogenesis in monolayer cultures and chondrogenesis in pellet cultures. Remarkably, when grown in standard cell culture medium in monolayer cultures, ASCs from yearlings spontaneously formed bone-like nodules surrounded by cartilaginous deposits, suggesting differentiation into osteogenic and chondrogenic lineages. This ability appears to be lost gradually with age. This is the first study to demonstrate stem cell recovery and growth from brown bears, and it is the first report of ASCs spontaneously forming extracellular matrix characteristic of bone and cartilage in the absence of specific inducers. These findings could have implications for the use of hibernating brown bears as a model to study disuse osteoporosis.",

Due to the lethality of these toxins, there are elevated concerns regarding their possible use as bioterrorism agents. Moreover, their widespread use for cosmetic purposes, and as medical treatments, has increased the potential risk of accidental overdosing and environmental exposure. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop novel modalities to counter BoNT intoxication. Mammalian motoneurons are the main target of BoNTs; however, due to the difficulty and poor efficiency of the procedures required to isolate the cells, they are not suitable for high-throughput drug screening assays. Here, we explored the suitability of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived motoneurons as a renewable, reproducible, and physiologically relevant system for BoNT studies. We found that the sensitivity of ES-derived motoneurons to BoNT/A intoxication is comparable to that of primary mouse spinal motoneurons. Additionally, we demonstrated that several BoNT/A inhibitors protected SNAP-25, the BoNT/A substrate, in the ES-derived motoneuron system. Furthermore, this system is compatible with immunofluorescence-based high-throughput studies. These data suggest that ES-derived motoneurons provide a highly sensitive system that is amenable to large-scale screenings to rapidly identify and evaluate the biological efficacies of novel therapeutics.",

Human MSC secretions were collected as conditioned medium (MSC-CM) using a clinically compliant protocol. Based on proteomic and pathway analysis of MSC-CM, an in vitro assay of HUVEC spheroids was performed identifying the angiogenic properties of MSC-CM. Subsequently, pigs were subjected to surgical left circumflex coronary artery ligation and randomized to intravenous MSC-CM treatment or non-CM (NCM) treatment for 7\u00a0days.

Secretome analysis of MSCs grown under serum-deprived conditions (SD-MSCs) identified a significant upregulation of prosurvival and angiogenic factors including VEGF-A, ANGPTs, IGF-1, and HGF. An ex vivo rat aortic assay demonstrated longer neovascular sprouts generated from rat aortic rings cultured in SD-MSC-conditioned media compared to neovascular sprouts from aortas grown in MSC-conditioned media. With prolonged serum deprivation, a subpopulation of SD-MSCs began to exhibit an endothelial phenotype. This population expressed endothelial-specific proteins including VEGFR2, Tie2/TEK, PECAM/CD31, and eNOS and also demonstrated the ability to uptake acetylated LDL. SD-MSCs also exhibited enhanced microtubule formation in an in vitro angiogenesis assay. Modified chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) angiogenesis assays showed significantly higher angiogenic potential for SD-MSCs compared to MSCs. Analysis of CAMs grown with SD-MSCs identified human-specific CD31-positive cells in vascular structures.

This study explored the possibility of establishing porcine EGC from domestic breeds and Yucatan mini pigs using embryos at Days 17\u201324 of gestation. In vitro culture of PGC from both pooled and individual embryos resulted in the successful derivation of putative EGC lines from Days 20 to 24 with high efficiency. RT-PCR showed that gene expression among all 31 obtained cell lines was very similar, and only minor changes were detected during in vitro passaging of the cells. Genome-wide RNA-Seq expression profiling showed no expression of the core pluripotency markers OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG, although most other pluripotency genes were expressed at levels comparable to those of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESC). Moreover, germ-specific genes such as BLIMP1 retained their expression. Functional annotation clustering of the gene expression pattern of the putative EGC suggests partial differentiation toward endo/mesodermal lineages. The putative EGC were able to form embryoid bodies in suspension culture and to differentiate into epithelial-like, mesenchymal-like, and neuronal-like cells. However, their injection into immunodeficient mice did not result in teratoma formation. Our results suggest that the PGC-derived cells described in this study are EGC-like, but seem to be multipotent rather than pluripotent cells. Nevertheless, the thorough characterization of these cells in this study, and especially the identification of various genes and pathways involved in pluripotency by RNA-Seq, will serve as a rich resource for further derivation of porcine EGC.",

Additionally, we investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of Fgf receptor (FGFR) isoform distribution in activin A-treated ES cell cultures and find that FGFR(III)c isoforms are expressed in DE as well as non-DE populations, whereas FGFR2(III)b and FGFR4 are found specifically enriched in the DE fraction. Ligands that preferentially activate the FGFR(III)c isoforms induce mesendoderm markers T and Gsc, but reduce expression of the DE marker Sox17 in activin-induced EpCAM+ cells. In contrast, ligands specifically activating FGFR(III)b isoforms have no effect on either population. Activation of FGFR(III)c isoforms results in a strong mitogenic effect on activin A-induced ES cell progeny early in the differentiation period whereas activation of FGFR(III)b isoforms has only a moderate mitogenic effect confined to the late differentiation period.

As such, novel biologically active substrates manufacturable to GMP standards have the potential to improve cell culture-based assay applications. Currently hepatic endoderm (HE) generated from pluripotent stem cells is a genotypically diverse, cheap, and stable source of \u201chepatocytes\u201d; however, HE routine applications are limited due to phenotypic instability in culture. Therefore a manufacturable subcellular matrix capable of supporting long-term differentiated cell function would represent a step forward in developing scalable and phenotypically stable hESC-derived hepatocytes. Adopting an unbiased approach we screened polymer microarrays and identified a polyurethane matrix which promoted HE viability, hepatocellular gene expression, drug-inducible metabolism, and function. Moreover, the polyurethane supported, when coated on a clinically approved bio-artificial liver matrix, long-term hepatocyte function and growth. In conclusion, our data suggest that an unbiased screening approach can identify cell culture substrate(s) that enhance the phenotypic stability of primary and stem cell-derived cell resources.",

     "abstract": "The establishment of in vitro culture systems to expand stem cells and to elucidate the niche/stem cell interaction is among the most sought-after culture systems of our time. To further investigate niche/stem cell interactions, we evaluated in vitro cultures of isolated intact male germline\u2013niche complexes (i.e., apical complexes), complexes with empty niche spaces, and completely empty niches (i.e., isolated apical cells) from the testes of Locusta migratoria and the interaction of these complexes with isolated germline stem cells, spermatogonia (of transit-amplifying stages), cyst progenitor cells, cyst progenitor cell-like cells, cyst cells, and follicle envelope cells. The structural characteristics of these cell types allow the identification of the different cell types in primary cultures, which we studied in detail by light and electron microscopy. In intact testes germline stem cells strongly adhere to their niche (the apical cell), but emigrate from their niche and form filopodia if the apical complex is put into culture with \u201cstandard media.\u201d The lively movements of the long filopodia of isolated germline stem cells and spermatogonia may be indicative of their search for specific signals to home to their niche. All other incubated cell types (except for follicle envelope cells) expressed rhizopodia and lobopodia. Nevertheless isolated germline stem cells in culture do not migrate to empty niche spaces of nearby apical cells. This could indicate that apical cells lose their germline stem cell attracting ability in vitro, although apical cells devoid of germline stem cells either by emigration of germline stem cells or by mechanical removal of germline stem cells are capable of surviving in vitro up to 56\u00a0days, forming many small lobopodia and performing amoeboid movements. We hypothesize that the breakdown of the apical complex in vitro with standard media interrupts the signaling between the germline stem cells and the niche (and conceivably the cyst progenitor cells) which directs the typical behavior of the male regenerative center. Previously we demonstrated the necessity of the apical cell for the survival of the germline stem cell. From these studies we are now able to culture viable isolated germline stem cells and all cells of its niche complex, although DNA synthesis stops after Day 1 in culture. This enables us to examine the effects of supplements to our standard medium on the interaction of the germline stem cell with its niche, the apical cell. The supplements we evaluated included conditioned medium, tissues, organs, and hemolymph of male locusts, insect hormones, mammalian growth factors, Ca2+ ion, and a Ca2+ ionophore. Although biological effects on the germline stem cell and apical cell could be detected with the additives, none of these supplements restored the in vivo behavior of the incubated cell types. We conclude that the strong adhesion between germline stem cells and apical cells in vivo is actively maintained by peripheral factors that reach the apical complex via hemolymph, since a hemolymph\u2013testis barrier does not exist. The in vitro culture model introduced in this study provides a platform to scan for possible regulatory factors that play a key role in a feedback loop that keeps germline stem cell division and sperm disposal in equilibrium.",

We were able to differentiate hESCs to all three primary germ layers, screen for the effect of a range of activin A, BMP4, and VEGF concentrations on endoderm and mesoderm differentiation, and perform RNA-interference (RNAi)-mediated knockdown of a reporter gene during differentiation. Cells were seeded in suspension culture and embryoid bodies were induced to differentiate to the three primary germ layers for 6\u00a0days. Endoderm (CXCR4+KDR\u2013), mesoderm (KDR+SSEA-3\u2013), and ectoderm (SSEA-3+NCAM+) differentiation yields for H9 cells were 80\u00a0\u00b1\u00a011, 78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07, and 41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09%, respectively. Germ layer identities were confirmed by quantitative PCR. Activin A, BMP4, and bFGF drove differentiation, with increasing concentrations of activin A inducing higher endoderm yields and increasing BMP4 inducing higher mesoderm yields. VEGF drove lateral mesoderm differentiation. RNAi-mediated knockdown of constitutively expressed red fluorescent protein did not affect endoderm differentiation. This assay facilitates the development of serum-free protocols for hESC differentiation to target lineages and creates a platform for screening small molecules or RNAi during ESC differentiation.",

We have developed a simple method that eliminates the tumorigenic potential from differentiated ESC cultures of murine and human origin while purifying lineage-restricted, definitive endoderm-committed cells. A three-stage scheme utilizing magnetic bead sorting and specific antibodies to remove undifferentiated ESCs and extraembryonic endoderm cells, followed by positive selection of definitive endoderm cells on the basis of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) expression, was used to isolate a population of EpCAM+SSEA1\u2013SSEA3\u2013 cells. Sorted cells do not form teratomas after transplantation into immunodeficient mice, but display gene and protein expression profiles indicative of definitive endoderm cells. Sorted cells could be subsequently expanded in vitro and further differentiated to express key pancreas specification proteins. In vivo transplantation of sorted cells resulted in small, benign tissues that uniformly express PDX1. These studies describe a straightforward method without genetic manipulation that eliminates the risk of teratoma formation from ESC differentiated derivatives. Significantly, enriched populations isolated by this method appear to be lineage-restricted definitive endoderm cells with limited proliferation capacity.",

While the role of extracellular factors in controlling the pluripotency and differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been the subject of much investigation, the identity and role of extrinsic factors in modulating ESC growth under conditions supporting self-renewal remain largely unknown. We demonstrate that mouse ESC (mESC) growth is density dependent and that one of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon is the action of survival-enhancing autocrine factors. Proteomic analysis of proteins secreted by mouse ESCs demonstrates significant levels of cyclophilin A which increases the growth rate of mouse ESCs in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, inhibition of the cyclophilin A receptor CD147 decreases the growth rate of mESCs. These findings identify cyclophilin A as a novel survival-enhancing autocrine factor in mouse ESC cultures.",

These cells could potentially be used in clinical applications and basic research. Here, we explored the molecular role of Sox2 by generating iPSCs that expressed Sox2 at various levels. Low Sox2 (LS) expression increased the efficiency of generating partially reprogrammed iPSCs in combination with OKM. Notably, we detected a significant increase in the number of fully reprogrammed iPSCs with three factors of OK and LS. LS expression was linked with the reduced expression of ectoderm and mesoderm marker genes. This indicates that cell differentiation into the ectoderm and mesoderm lineages was impeded during reprogramming. The quality of the iPSCs that was generated by using OK and LS was comparable to that of iPSCs that were produced via conventional OSK as seen by pluripotent marker gene expression and chimera formation.

Mouse female pluripotent stem cells do not express Xist, and harbor two active X chromosomes. However, analysis of XCI in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), mainly based on XIST expression, was not conclusive. Here, we studied XCI in hESCs by meta-analysis of the expression of the entire set of genes on the X chromosome in 21 female hESC lines. Thus, we could divide the ES cell lines into three categories: lines with no XCI, lines with full XCI, and lines with partial XCI. The partial inactivation of the X chromosome always involved the middle of the chromosome, surrounding the XIST transcription site. The status of XCI in some of the cell lines was validated by either allelic-specific expression or DNA methylation analysis. Interestingly, analysis of 10 female human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines demonstrated similar heterogeneity in the inactivation of X chromosome and could also be classified into the same three categories detected in hESCs. Thus, we could show that in some hiPSC lines, the X chromosome was activated on reprogramming. Based on our analysis, we propose a model of the dynamics of XCI in pluripotent stem cells.",

A current area of intense interest is the development of defined surfaces for stem cell derivation, maintenance, proliferation and subsequent differentiation, which are capable of replicating the complex cellular environment existing in vivo. During development many cellular cues result from integrin signalling induced by the local extracellular matrix. There are 24 known integrin heterodimers comprised of one of 18 \u03b1 subunits and one of 8 \u03b2 subunits and these have a diverse range of functions mediating cell-cell adhesion, growth factor receptor responses and intracellular signalling cascades for cell migration, differentiation, survival and proliferation. We discuss here a brief summary of defined conditions for human embryonic stem cell culture together with a description of integrin function and signalling pathways. The importance of integrin expression during development is highlighted as critical for lineage specific cell function and how consideration of the integrin expression profile should be made while differentiating stem cells for use in therapy. In addition this review summarises the known integrin expression profiles for human embryonic stem cells and 3 common adult stem cell types: mesenchymal, haematopoietic and neural. We then outline some of the possible technologies available for investigating cell-extracellular matrix interactions and subsequent integrin mediated cell responses.",

Currently embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can differentiate into articular cartilage by forming aggregates (embryoid body (EB), pellet, micromass), which are difficult to image. We present a novel, single-step method of generating murine ESC-derived chondrocytes in monolayer cultures under chemically defined conditions. Mesoderm induction was achieved in cultures supplemented with BMP4, activin A, or Wnt3a. Prolonged culture with sustained activin A, TGF\u03b23, or BMP4 supplementation led to robust chondrogenic induction. A short pulse of activin A or BMP4 also induced chondrogenesis efficiently while Wnt3a acted as a later inducer. Long-term supplementation with activin A or with activin A followed by TGF\u03b23 promoted articular cartilage formation. Thus, we devised a serum-free (SF) culture system to generate ESC-derived chondrocytes without the establishment of 3D cultures or the aid of cell sorting.

The molecular basis for these stem cell properties is unclear and unlike embryonic stem cells (ESC) none of the major stem cell factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG exhibits significant expression in USSC. Here, we report that these key stem cell genes hold an epigenetic state in between that of an ESC and a terminally differentiated cell type. DNA methylation analysis exhibits partial demethylation of the regulatory region of OCT4 and a demethylated state of the NANOG and SOX2 promoter/enhancer regions. Further genome-wide DNA methylation profiling identified a partially demethylated state of the telomerase gene hTERT. Moreover, none of the pluripotency factors exhibited a repressive histone signature. Notably, SOX2 exhibits a bivalent histone signature consisting of the opposing histone marks dimeH3K4 and trimeH3K27, which is typically found on genes that are \"poised\" for transcription. Consequently, ectopic expression of OCT4 in USSC led to rapid induction of expression of its known target gene SOX2. Our data suggest that incomplete epigenetic repression and a \"poised\" epigenetic status of pluripotency genes preserves the USSC potential to be able to react adequately to distinct differentiation and reprogramming cues.",

Whole genome microarray analysis of these cell lines was compared with Relicell\u00aehES1 and it showed that approximately 9000 genes were expressed by these lines. As expected the expression pattern of these new cell lines bore close resemblance to that of Relicell\u00aehES1. A majority of the pluripotency genes and the genes known to inhibit various differentiation pathways were also expressed by these cell lines. We also observed that each of these cell lines expressed a unique set of genes that are mutually exclusive from each other. These results represent the first detailed characterization of a set of hESC lines originating from India.",

Imaging of the limbal niche demonstrated close spatial arrangement between basal limbal epithelial cells within putative LESC niche structures and fibroblasts in the stroma. Interactions of the human limbal epithelial (HLE) cells and mitotically active human limbal fibroblasts (HLF) were studied for the first time in a serum-free in vitro model that simulated aspects of the limbal niche microenvironment. HLE cocultured in a ratio 3:1 with HLF exhibited enhanced expression of the putative stem cell markers ABCG2 and p63\u03b1 and holoclones were preserved as shown by colony-forming efficiency assays, clonal analysis, and colony characterisation. Interleukin 6 (IL6) was found to be up-regulated in the 3.1SF system when compared to the HLE culture with growth-arrested fibroblasts and serum (gold standard system, GS). IL6 caused a time-dependent phosphorylation of STAT3 in HLE cells. STAT3 and IL6 inhibition in 3.1SF cultures significantly reduced HLE colony-forming efficiency, suggesting a previously undetected STAT3-mediated involvement of IL6 in the maintenance of HLE cells in a progenitor-like state.",

However, little is known about the composition and spatial relationships of tissues within teratomas that may provide clues about development and platforms for studying organ development. Additionally, teratoma formation and analysis lack standards for reporting as assays of pluripotency. Three of 27 total teratomas derived from pedigreed primate embryonic stem cells underwent quantitative three-dimensional high-resolution magnetic resonance microscopy (MRM). Teratomas were subsequently serially sectioned and tissue types identified, semiquantitated, and correlated with MRM images. All teratomas demonstrated tissue derivatives from the three germ layers and approximately 23 different tissue types were identified. Certain tissue groups attempted to form organs more frequently (e.g., trachea/bronchi, small intestine). MRM discriminated some tissues readily (e.g., bone, adipose, cartilage) while other tissue types with like MR intensities could not be distinguished. Semiquantitative histopathological analysis of teratomas demonstrates the ability to delineate multiple tissues as derived from ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm and to use this information for comparison to other teratomas. MRM provides rapid quantitative imaging of intact teratomas that complements histology and identifies sites of interest for additional biological studies.",

Self-renewal and tumorigenic activities were enriched in MCL cell fractions that lacked expression of the prototypic B-cell surface marker, CD19. CD45+CD19- cells represented a relatively small fraction of the total MCL tumor cells; however, they recapitulated the heterogeneity of original patient tumors on transplantation into immunodeficient mice. As few as 100 of these cells displayed self-renewal capacities in secondary and tertiary recipient mice by in vivo limiting dilution assays. Similar to leukemic stem cells, CD45+CD19- MCL cells also displayed a quiescent status as determined by dye efflux assays. In summary, this study is the first to isolate subpopulations of MCL cells that have self-renewal and tumorigenic capacities.

Its effects on over 1800 proteins were quantified with high confidence. Of those up-regulated by Tel/PDGFR\u03b2 several were involved in the interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3) response. To validate these observations we employed embryonic and myeloid stem cells models which revealed Tel/PDGFR\u03b2-induced STAT1 up-regulation and activation was responsible for modulating the interferon response. A STAT1 target highly up-regulated was ICSBP, a transcriptional regulator of myeloid and eosinophilic differentiation. ICSBP interacts with CBP/p300 and Ets transcription factors, to promote transcription of additional genes, including the Egr family, key regulators of myelopoiesis. These interferon responses were recapitulated using IFN\u03b3 stimulation of stem cells.

The upscaled WJ-MSCs retained their differentiation potential and immunosuppressive capacity. They expressed the typical hMSC surface antigens and the addition of bFGF in the culture medium did not affect the expression levels of HLA-DR and CD 44. A normal karyotype was confirmed in the large-scale expanded WJ-MSCs.

While a half-life of approximately 20\u00a0days of human albumin in humans is established, the duration of its detectability in mice is unknown. Here we show that human albumin is readily detectable in the serum of mice injected with nonviable human hepatocytes. Human albumin levels peak 24\u00a0h after injection of hepatocyte debris, and remain detectable at significant levels for at least 8\u00a0days.

OPCs were differentiated as spheres in defined serum-free medium supplemented with recombinant human growth factors. A broad gene expression analysis revealed that this OPC population expressed Olig1/2, Sox10, PDGFR, Nkx2.2, Nkx6.2, oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein, myelin basic protein (MBP), and proteolipid protein (PLP). According to quantitative RT-PCR analyses addition of ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) upregulated the Olig2 mRNA levels in the OPC population. According to the flow cytometry analyses the OPC population was >\u00a090% NG2-positive, >\u00a080% PDGFR-positive, and >\u00a060% CD44-positive, and further matured into O4- (45%) and GalC- (80%) positive oligodendrocyte populations when cultured on top of human extracellular matrix proteins, which were used instead of Matrigel. In addition, OPCs matured into myelin-forming cells when cocultured with neuronal cells. The multilayered myelin sheet formation around axons was detected with transmission electron microscopy in cocultures. Further, the OPC populations could be purified with sorting of NG2+ cells. These NG2+ cells reformed spheres that remained stable during prolonged culturing (7\u00a0weeks), and matured into GalC-positive oligodendrocytes. Importantly, these NG2+ spheres were free of pluripotent Tra1-81, Oct-4, and CD326-positive hESCs.

Our assay was designed to detect changes in the phenotype of hESC colonies by quantifying multiple parameters, including the number of cells in a colony, colony area and shape, intensity of nuclear staining, and the percentage of cells in the colony that express a marker of pluripotency (TRA-1-60), as well as the number of colonies per well. We used this assay to screen 1040 compounds from two commercial compound libraries, and identified 17 that promoted differentiation, as well as 5 that promoted survival of hESCs. Among the novel small compounds we identified with activity on hESC are several steroids that promote hESC differentiation and the antihypertensive drug, pinacidil, which affects hESC survival. The analysis of overlapping targets of pinacidil and the other survival compounds revealed that activity of PRK2, ROCK, MNK1, RSK1, and MSK1 kinases may contribute to the survival of hESCs.",

However, methodologies for in vitro EB differentiation have not been quantitatively evaluated and compared. Using the hematopoietic lineage as a test for differentiation competency, we performed multiparameter comparisons of three prevalent EB methods: (1) suspension (SP), (2) hanging drop (HD), and (3) forced aggregation (FA). Although FA improved the homogeneity between hEBs, the highest hematopoietic induction efficiencies were observed in EBs formed in SP culture independent of the presence or absence of serum. Despite the EB formation method used, EB-based hematopoietic differentiation could be potently influenced by EB size and was augmented by paracrine signaling between cocultured EBs. Our study identifies physical and physiological parameters contributing to the efficiency of hESC differentiation in EB formats and reveals that EB methods are best tailored to specific applications unique to cell replacement vs small molecule screening or early human development.",

These cells can be manipulated experimentally to generate cells of multiple tissue types which could be important in treating human diseases. The ability to produce relevant amounts of these differentiated cell populations creates the basis for clinical interventions in tissue regeneration and repair. Understanding how embryonic stem cells differentiate also can reveal important insights into cell biology. A previously reported mouse embryonic stem cell model demonstrated that differentiated epithelial cells migrated out of embryoid bodies attached to reconstituted basement membrane. We used genomic technology to profile ES cell populations in order to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to epithelial differentiation. Cells with characteristics of cultured epithelium migrated from embryoid bodies attached to reconstituted basement membrane. However, cells that comprised embryoid bodies also rapidly lost ES cell-specific gene expression and expressed proteins characteristic of stratified epithelia within hours of attachment to basement membrane. Gene expression profiling of sorted cell populations revealed upregulation of the BMP/TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway, which was not sufficient for epithelial differentiation in the absence of basement membrane attachment. Activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and increased expression of Jun family transcription factors was observed during epithelial differentiation of ES cells. Inhibition of JNK signaling completely blocked epithelial differentiation in this model, revealing a key mechanism by which ES cells adopt epithelial characteristics via basement membrane attachment.",

Previous studies reported that, in contrast to mouse ES cells, human ES cells differentiate if ERK1/2 is inhibited. We reexamined the role of ERK1/2 in human ES cells using a chemically defined culture system and found that when ERK1/2 is blocked with specific chemical inhibitors, neural and mesendodermal differentiation is prevented, but cells become sensitive to BMP-induced differentiation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 significantly reduced the clonogenicity of human ES cells by preventing cell adhesion and survival. When this negative effect was avoided, we were able to maintain human ES cell self-renewal for more than 3\u00a0months in the presence of ERK1/2 inhibitors in a chemically defined culture system containing FGF2 and activin A but no BMP4. Our results suggest that the functional outcome of FGF/ERK1/2 signaling in human ES cells is influenced by the relative levels of activin A/TGF\u03b2 and BMP activity. Moreover, activation of ERK1/2 in human ES cells is required for proper neural and mesendodermal differentiation.

Treatment of BM cells from G-CSF-treated mice with hydroxyurea did not alter CFU-F numbers, suggesting that the increase in their numbers in response to G-CSF administration is not due to proliferation of existing CFU-F. Given previous studies demonstrating that G-CSF potently induces bone turnover in mice, we hypothesized that the increase in CFU-F may be triggered by the bone resorption that occurs following G-CSF administration. In accord with this hypothesis, administration of an inhibitor of osteoclast differentiation, osteoprotegerin (OPG), prevented the increase of CFU-F numbers induced by G-CSF. In conclusion, these data indicate that the cytokine treatment routinely used to mobilize hematopoietic stem cells could provide a readily applicable method to induce in vivo expansion of MPC for clinical applications.",

     "abstract": "Oxygen tension is an important component of the stem cell microenvironment. Herein, we have studied the effect of low oxygen levels (2% O2), or hypoxia, in the expansion of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. In the presence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cell proliferation was reduced under hypoxia and a simultaneous reduction in cell viability was also observed. Morphological changes and different cell cycle patterns were observed, suggesting some early differentiation under hypoxic conditions. However, when cells were maintained in a ground state of pluripotency, by inhibition of autocrine FGF4/ERK and GSK3 signaling, hypoxia did not affect cell proliferation, and did not induce early differentiation. As expected, there was an increase in lactate-specific production rate and a significant increase in the glucose consumption under hypoxic conditions. Nevertheless, during neural commitment, low oxygen tension exerted a positive effect on early differentiation of ground-state ES cells, resulting in a faster commitment toward neural progenitors. Overall our results demonstrate the need to specifically regulate the oxygen content, especially hypoxia, along with other culture conditions, when developing new strategies for ES cell expansion and/or controlled differentiation.",

Given this possibility, the optimization of methods for the generation of human induc pluripotent stem cells may require the identification of epigenetically appropriate somatic cell sources. Similarly, techniques for controlling epigenetic modification by environmental factors may also play a critical role in the development of epigenetically stable sources of pluripotent stem cells.",

Mechanistically, our data suggest that E-cadherin plays a role in hESC aggregation and that dissociation and re-aggregation upon passaging functions as a purification step towards a pluripotency markers-enriched population. Mass expansion of hESC was readily achieved by up-scaling 2\u00a0ml cultures to serial passaging in 50\u00a0ml spinner flasks. A media comparison revealed that mTeSR was superior to KnockOut-SR in supporting cell proliferation and pluripotency. Persistent expression of pluripotency markers was achieved for two lines (hES2, hES3) that were used at higher passages (>\u00a086). In contrast, rapid down regulation of Oct4, Tra-1-60, and SSEA4 was observed for ESI049, a clinically compliant line, used at passages 20-36.

In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the application of iPSC technology to this species, here we derived lines of marmoset iPSCs. Using retroviral transduction with human Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 and c-Myc, we derived clones that fulfil critical criteria for successful reprogramming: they exhibit typical iPSC morphology; they are alkaline phosphatase positive; they express high levels of NANOG, OCT4 and SOX2 mRNAs, while the corresponding vector genes are silenced; they are immunoreactive for Oct4, TRA-1-81 and SSEA-4; and when implanted into immunodeficient mice they produce teratomas that have derivatives of all three germ layers (endoderm, \u03b1-fetoprotein; ectoderm, \u03b2III-tubulin; mesoderm, smooth muscle actin).

Also, we quantified their arrhythmogenic response and compared this to a contemporary used rabbit Purkinje fiber (PF) model. Multiple transmembrane action potentials (AP) were recorded from 164 hESC-CM clusters (9 different batches), and 12 isolated PFs from New Zealand White rabbits. AP duration (APD), early afterdepolarizations (EADs), triangulation (T), and short-term variability of repolarization (STV) were determined on application of the IKr blocker E-4031 (0.03/0.1/0.3/1\u00a0\u03bcM). Isoproterenol (0.1\u00a0\u03bcM) was used to assess adrenergic response. To validate the phenotype, RNA isolated from atrial- and ventricular-like clusters (n\u00a0=\u00a08) was analyzed using low-density Taqman arrays. Based on initial experiments, slow beating rate (<\u00a050\u00a0bpm) and long APD (>\u00a0200\u00a0ms) were used to select 31 ventricular-like clusters. E-4031 (1\u00a0\u03bcM) prolonged APD (31/31) and induced EADs only in clusters with APD90\u00a0>\u00a0300\u00a0ms (11/16).

According to ROC values, hESC-CMs (STV 0.91) could predict EADs at least equivalent to PF (STV 0.69). Isoproterenol shortened APD and completely suppressed EADs. Gene expression analysis revealed that HCN1/2, KCNA5, and GJA5 were higher\u204e in atrial/nodal-like cells, whereas KCNJ2 and SCN1B were higher\u204e in ventricular-like cells (\u204eP\u00a0<\u00a00.05).

This could be accomplished by combining the microelectrode array (MEA) system with cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and induced pluripotential stem cells. CMs have been successfully induced from both types, but their maturation process is not systematically controlled; this results in loss of beating potency and insufficient ion channel function. We generated a transgenic hESC line that facilitates maintenance of hESC-CM clusters every 2 weeks by expressing GFP driven by a cardiac-specific \u03b1MHC promoter, thereby producing a compact pacemaker lineage within a ventricular population over a year. Further analyses, including quantitative RT-PCR, patch-clamp, and MEA-mediated QT tests, demonstrated that replating culturing continuously enhanced gene expression, ionic current amplitudes, and resistance to K+ channel blockades in hESC-CMs. Moreover, temporal three-dimensional (3D) culturing accelerated maturation by restoring the global gene repressive status established in the adhesive status. Replating/3D culturing thus produces hESC-CMs that act as functional syncytia suitable for use in regenerative medicine and accurate drug tests.",

In the presence of WNT3a, four hiPS cell lines derived from human skin fibroblasts commonly generated KDR+ and/or PDGFR\u03b1+ progeny by day 8 of differentiation. Endogenous BMP signaling was required for the WNT3a-directed upregulation of hemogenic cell development and the hemoangiogenic activity was confined in all cases to the KDR+PDGFR\u03b1lo fraction. Thus, iPS cells derived from human skin fibroblasts resemble hES cells in the generation of hematopoietic and endothelial cells in vitro.",

     "abstract": "The satellite cell of skeletal muscle provides a paradigm for quiescent and activated tissue stem cell states. We have carried out transcriptome analyses on satellite cells purified by flow cytometry from Pax3GFP/+ mice. We compared samples from adult skeletal muscles where satellite cells are mainly quiescent, with samples from growing muscles or regenerating (mdx) muscles, where they are activated. Analysis of regulation that is shared by both activated states avoids other effects due to immature or pathological conditions. This in vivo profile differs from that of previously analyzed satellite cells activated after cell culture. It reveals how the satellite cell protects itself from damage and maintains quiescence, while being primed for activation on receipt of the appropriate signal. This is illustrated by manipulation of the corepressor Dach1, and by the demonstration that quiescent satellite cells are better protected from oxidative stress than those from mdx or 1-week-old muscles. The quiescent versus in vivo activated comparison also gives new insights into how the satellite cell controls its niche on the muscle fiber through cell adhesion and matrix remodeling. The latter also potentiates growth factor activity through proteoglycan modification. Dismantling the extracellular matrix is important for satellite cell activation when the expression of proteinases is up-regulated, whereas transcripts for their inhibitors are high in quiescent cells. In keeping with this, we demonstrate that metalloproteinase function is required for efficient regeneration in vivo.",

We demonstrate the efficacy of this panel by characterizing 4 hESC lines, derived in two different laboratories using different derivation techniques, as pathogen free, genetically stable, and able to differentiate into derivatives of all three germ layers.

This is the first study in which dose responses of such a wide range of compounds on hESC-CM have been generated and shown to be predictive of clinical effects.

Although a number of molecules have been implicated in regulation of asymmetric stem cell division, here, we highlight known tumor suppressors with established roles in this process. While a subset of these tumor suppressors were originally defined in developmental contexts, recent investigations reveal they are also lost or mutated in human cancers. Mutations in tumor suppressors involved in asymmetric stem cell division provide mechanisms by which cancer stem cells can hyperproliferate and offer an intriguing new focus for understanding cancer biology.

Yet, the molecular mechanisms by which hESC retain their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation remain unclear. The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in organogenesis and differentiation during development, and is also involved in the proliferation and cell-fate specification of neural stem cells and neural crest stem cells. As there has been no detailed study of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling pathway in hESC, this study examines the expression and functional role of SHH during hESC self-renewal and differentiation. Here, we show the gene and protein expression of key components of the SHH signaling pathway in hESC and differentiated embryoid bodies. Despite the presence of functioning pathway components, SHH plays a minimal role in maintaining pluripotency and regulating proliferation of undifferentiated hESC. However, during differentiation with retinoic acid, a GLI-responsive luciferase assay and target genes PTCH1 and GLI1 expression reveal that the SHH signaling pathway is highly activated. Besides, addition of exogenous SHH to hESC differentiated as embryoid bodies increases the expression of neuroectodermal markers Nestin, SOX1, MAP2, MSI1, and MSX1, suggesting that SHH signaling is important during hESC differentiation toward the neuroectodermal lineage. Our findings provide a new insight in understanding the SHH signaling in hESC and the further development of hESC differentiation for regenerative medicine.",

     "abstract": "The long-term culture of human embryonic stem (ES) cells is inevitably subject to evolution, since any mutant that arises with a growth advantage will be selectively amplified. However, the evolutionary influences of population size, mutation rate, and selection pressure are frequently overlooked. We have constructed a Monte Carlo simulation model to predict how changes in these factors can influence the appearance and spread of mutant ES cells, and verified its applicability by comparison with in vitro data. This simulation provides an estimate for the expected rate of generation of culture-adapted ES cells under different assumptions for the key parameters. In particular, it highlights the effect of population size, suggesting that the maintenance of cells in small populations reduces the likelihood that abnormal cultures will develop.",

     "publication date": "01-2010",
     "abstract": "Degeneration of joint articular cartilage is a leading cause of disability worldwide, and is due in large part to the fact that adult articular cartilage is unable to undergo effective intrinsic repair. To overcome this barrier, we have developed a tissue engineering strategy which harnesses the superior anabolic activity of juvenile chondrocytes to produce a scaffold-independent, living neocartilage graft. Preclinical studies demonstrate that bioengineered neocartilage survives allogeneic and xenogeneic transplantation, suggesting the utility of universal donor-derived neocartilage for joint repair. However, the mechanism underlying neocartilage transplant tolerance remains poorly understood. We show here that neocartilage-derived chondrocytes are unable to stimulate allogeneic T cells in vitro, and they do not constitutively express cell surface molecules required for induction of T cell immune responses, including major histocompatibility complex (MHC) Class II antigens and costimulatory molecules B7-1 and B7-2. Additionally, chondrocytes suppress, in a contact-dependent manner, the proliferation of activated T cells, with suppression associated with chondrocyte expression of multiple negative regulators of immune responses, including B7 family members (B7-H1, B7-DC, B7-H2, B7-H3, and B7-H4), chondromodulin-I and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Thus, the survival of transplanted bioengineered neocartilage may depend on both passive and active mechanisms of immune evasion.",

     "abstract": "The aims of this study were to systematically characterize the distribution, proliferation, and differentiation of Islet-1+(Isl1+) progenitor cells in the early first trimester human embryonic heart during which period most of the organogenesis takes place. In hearts of gestational week 5 to 10 Isl1+cells were identified and mainly clustered in the outflow tract and to a lesser extent in the atria and in the right ventricle. Some of the clusters were also troponin T+. Unexpectedly a only few Isl1+cells were Ki67+while in the ventricles a majority of Isl1\u2212troponinT+cells were Ki67+. Cultures derived from the digested embryonic heart developed into spontaneously beating cardiospheres. At harvest cells in these cardiospheres showed frequent expression of troponin T+and Nkx2.5+, while Isl1 was expressed only in scattered cells. Only a minority of the cultured cells expressed Ki67. The cardiospheres could be frozen, thawed, and recultured to beating cardiospheres. In a multielectrode array system, the beating cardiospheres were responsive to adrenergic stimulation and exhibited rate-dependent action potential duration. In conclusion, the early first trimester human embryonic heart expresses clusters of Isl1+cells, some of which differentiate into cardiomyocytes. Unexpectedly, only a minority of the Isl1+cells, while a majority of ventricular cardiomyocytes, were proliferating. Spontaneously beating cardiospheres could be derived from the human embryonic heart and these cardiospheres showed functional frequency control.",
