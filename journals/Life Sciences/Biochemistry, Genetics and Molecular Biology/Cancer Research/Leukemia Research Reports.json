The presence of recurring chromosomal abnormalities (either numeral or structural rearrangements) provides immediate clues to the genetic events leading to leukemia and many abnormalities have important prognostic significance. The rare translocation t(14,21)(q11.2;q22) has been described in pediatric T lineage ALL in only one case so far in 2000. The present study is a case report of an ALL case in which we found a t(14,21)(q11.2;q22) as a non random chromosomal abnormality among 70 analyzed pediatric ALL cases referred exclusively to BIOLAB Laboratory from the children hospital of Morocco.",

However, published outcome data of MUDT in India are scant, with reports limited to autologous and allogenic matched unrelated transplants, which motivated us to present our MUDT data.To review the operations, and more importantly, the patient outcome data of a new registry in India.We accessed an Indian HLA donor database with high-resolution HLA typing results of 7682 (until 31st July 2018) volunteer HLA donors. The typing results were uploaded to proprietary software. The search result was considered a \u201cmatch\u201d when a 10/10 potential HLA match was found. Patients who were found to be alive through mail communication and did not exhibit signs and symptoms of disease were considered to have disease-free survival (DFS).During the six years of operations of the database, 1165 searches resulted in 68 10/10 matches from the registry. Of these, 11 were MUD HPCT records. At a minimum follow-up of almost 11 months, seven recipients continue to exhibit DFS.The patient DFS data prove that even a small registry with slightly more than 7000 donors can yield reasonably good patient outcomes.",

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology is a major breakthrough for cancer treatment, with the recent approval of CD19-directed CAR (CD19CAR) for treating B-cell malignancies. However, little information exists on using CD19CAR for other CD19 positive neoplasms such as AML. Our findings indicate that CD19CAR therapy can potentially be used for those with mixed phenotype leukemia and a subset of AML cases.",

Clinically, this case was notable for severe differentiation syndrome despite treatment with high-dose dexamethasone. Cytokine production by differentiating APL cells was not directly abrogated by JAK2 inhibitors in vitro, suggesting that JAK2 V617F enhances the hyperinflammatory response downstream of cytokines. JAK1/2 inhibitors may therefore dampen the inflammatory cascade downstream of cytokine production, similar to glucocorticoids, and have a role in treating severe differentiation syndrome.",

The first mutation was a nucleotide base substitution from guanine to adenine within exon 8, resulting in a nonsense mutation in the DNA-binding inhibitory domain of the Runx1 protein. This nonsense mutation is suspected a de novo germline mutation since both parents are negative for the mutation. The second mutation identified was an in-frame six nucleotide base pair insertion in exon 5 of the RUNX1 gene, which is predicted to result in an insertion in the DNA-binding runt homology domain (RHD). This mutation is believed to be a somatic mutation as it was mosaic before allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation and disappeared after transplant. As no other genetic mutation was found using genetic screening, it is speculated that the combined effect of these two RUNX1 mutations may have exerted a stronger dominant negative effect than either RUNX1 mutation alone, thus leading to a myeloid malignancy.",

In this short communication, we report a well documented case of donor-derived de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that developed fourteen years after allogeneic stem cell transplantation for treatment induced AML for his primary malignancy Immunoblastic lymphoma.

The findings from this unique case, provides insight into the process of leukemogenesis, and suggests that the sequence of events leading to leukemogenesis in this patient involved the senescence/apoptosis of normal donor hematopoietic cells due to telomere shortening resulting in the selective proliferation and transformation of this clone with MLL (mixed-lineage leukemia) gene amplification.",

At progression aCGH revealed del(8q)(q23.2q24.11) encompassing various cancer relevant genes of which RAD21 and CSMD3 are of particular interest.",

The KIT D816H mutation was detected in the blood and bone marrow (BM). Induction chemotherapy with high-dose ARA-C and fludarabine (FLAG) was administered. Unexpectedly, the patient entered a hematologic remission with almost complete disappearance of neoplastic MC and a decrease of serum tryptase levels to normal range after 2 cycles of FLAG. Consecutively, the patient was prepared for allogeneic stem cell transplantation. However, shortly after the third cycle of FLAG, tryptase levels increased again, immature MC appeared in the blood, and the patient died from cerebral bleeding. Together, this case shows that intensive chemotherapy regimens, like FLAG, may induce remission in acute MCL. However, treatment responses are short-lived and the overall outcome remains dismal in these patients. We propose to separate this acute type of MCL from more subacute or chronic variants of MCL.",

Several characteristics, such as its very short half-life, distinguish Mcl-1 from other anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members. Additionally, Mcl-1 levels are regulated by a large number of pathways affecting its transcription, translation and degradation. A variety of approaches exploiting these features have been developed to inhibit directly or indirectly the anti-apoptotic function of Mcl-1. Many of these lend themselves well to combination therapies, leading to striking synergism, at least in preclinical models. In this brief review, we highlight some of the more promising strategies targeting Mcl-1 in AML, with a particular emphasis on rational combinations of novel agents.",

     "abstract": "Despite the remarkable success of imatinib against Bcr-Abl, development of secondary resistance, most often due to point mutations in the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK) domain, is quite common. Of these, the T315I \u201cgatekeeper\u201d mutation is resistant to all currently registered Bcr-Abl TK inhibitors (TKIs) with the notable exception of ponatinib (Iclusig\u2122), which was very recently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Besides ponatinib, numerous strategies have been developed to circumvent this problem. These include the protein synthesis inhibitor omacetaxine (Synribo\u00ae), and \u201cswitch-control\u201d inhibitors. Dual Bcr-Abl and aurora kinase inhibitors represent another promising strategy. Finally, several promising synergistic combinations, such as TKIs with histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), warrant attention.",

One mutation (p.R308P-GATA2) was a R308P substitution within the zinc finger (ZF)-1 domain, and the other (p.A350_N351ins8-GATA2) was an eight-amino-acid insertion between A350 and N351 residues within the ZF-2 domain. p.R308P-GATA2 did not affect DNA-binding and transcriptional activities, while p.A350_N351ins8-GATA2 reduced them, and impaired G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation of 32D cells. Although p.A350_N351ins8-GATA2 did not show a dominant-negative effect over wild-type (Wt)\u2013GATA2 by the reporter assay, it might be involved in the pathophysiology of AML by impairing myeloid differentiation because of little Wt-GATA2 expression in primary AML cells harboring the p.A350_N351ins8 mutation.",

     "abstract": "Hospital admission for neutropenic fever in patients with AML is a standard practice. However, discharge practices vary once patients become afebrile, with many patients hospitalized until rise in the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) to >500 (ANC recovery). Data to support this practice are sparse. We hypothesized that patients admitted for neutropenic fever, particularly if in complete remission (CR) or about to enter CR following the chemotherapy course associated with neutropenic fever, might be safely discharged earlier (ED). Benefits of ED are less exposure to hospital pathogens, reduced cost, increased availability of beds for patients more in need of urgent care, and potentially, enhanced psychological well-being.We identified patients age 18\u201370 with newly diagnosed AML who were admitted to the University of Washington Medical Center with neutropenic fever between January 2008 and May 2010. We compared subsequent (within 30 days of discharge) deaths, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and readmissions for neutropenic fever according to discharge ANC, regarded as a numerical variable using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test and as <500 vs >500 using the Fisher Exact test. We used the Mann\u2013Whitney U or Spearman correlation to analyze the relation between ANC at discharge and other covariates that might have affected outcome: age, ECOG performance status at admission for neutropenic fever, days inpatient, remission status, and type of infection (pneumonia, gram negative bacteremia, others).We evaluated 49 patients discharged after admission for neutropenic fever, 26 of whom were discharged with an ANC <500. Thirty five of the patients were in CR or entered CR following the chemotherapy course associated with their neutropenic fever admission. Patients who were discharged with lower ANC were more likely to be readmitted with neutropenic fever (Mann\u2013Whitney U p=0.03), although this was not true using ANC categorized as < vs >500 (Fisher Exact p=0.24, 95% confidence interval \u22120.47, 0.11). There was no relation between ANC at discharge and subsequent admission to an ICU (Mann\u2013Whitney U p=0.50, Fisher Exact p=0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.2, 0.34 using the 500 ANC cut off). One patient died: a 55 year old discharged with ANC 0 after successful treatment of neutropenic fever died 19 days after hospital readmission with fever of unknown origin. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia pneumonia and sepsis were discovered 14 days after readmission. Assuming a beta distribution and rates of death of 1/26 for discharge with ANC<500 and 0/23 for discharge with ANC>500, the probability that a discharge ANC with <500 is associated with a higher death rate is 0.019. The number of events was too small for a multivariate analysis. However, patients with better performance status (<ECOG 2) or who spent a shorter time in hospital after admission for neutropenic fever were more likely to be discharged with lower ANC (Fisher exact p=0.09 and Spearman p=0.02 respectively), while the likelihood of discharge with ANC<500 was unrelated to age, remission status, or type of infection. Thus we examined the relation between ANC and readmission for neutropenic fever separately in patients with better or worse performance status and in patients who spent more or less than the median time (8 days) in hospital after admission for neutropenic fever. This analysis indicated that patients discharged with lower ANC were more likely to be readmitted only if they had spent more than 8 days in hospital or if they were performance status <2.Our results suggest that an ANC of 500 is an excessively high cut off for discharge following hospitalization for neutropenic fever. The rate of rise of the ANC, as well as its absolute value, may also play a role.",

Sixty-eight months after the end of antiviral treatment the patient is asymptomatic and presents a condition compatible with an M-GUS. While the association between HCV infection and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is consolidated and it is clearly demonstrated that antiviral treatment in these patients can induce a high proportion of partial and complete remission, a similar effect was never described in MM.
